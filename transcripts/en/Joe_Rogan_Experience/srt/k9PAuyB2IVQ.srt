1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
We're going to go live

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,250
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,833
one.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,600
Tom Papa is obviously some sort of a 
nicotine junkie.

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,230
He's using a knife made out of a nail to
scratch.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,123
Open the box so he can get at these 
cigars like Ben Franklin use this knife 

7
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:20,580
to open up wine and once that's from the
pygmies.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,661
Oh really?
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:23,910
They made it for me.
Look at their little handle.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,390
My good friend Justin Wren,
who's been on the podcast a few times.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,310
He's this amazing guy that does.
He makes wells for the pygmies.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,650
He's.
He was a former UFC fighter knife fights

13
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:35,770
for Bella tour.
Uh,

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,560
uh,
he's in the heavyweight division.

15
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:38,394
This big teddy bear of a guy,
like the fucking nicest guy ever wanted 

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,940
me.
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,360
And he goes to the Congo and builds 
wells and we've,

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,470
we've helped them out.
We cut some people that donate bitcoin,

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,930
which by the way is worth more money 
now.

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,823
So what I'm going to do is take whatever
it's worth now and just give it to the 

21
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,270
Congo people.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,010
You gotta wait this week.
I've got to wait.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,770
JP Morgan Guide screwed it up.
He fucked up.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,890
Understand the bitcoin and just make it 
go up and down fast.

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,263
Um,
Ooh.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,410
They look beautiful.
They look luscious.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,540
How many people?
This is what,

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,940
this is what you offer somebody right 
before you screw them.

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,560
Joe Average,
cigar,

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,360
strange.
Stop.

31
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:22,140
And think about this.
When you are buying a cigar,

32
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,030
like let's think about the kind of 
people that you think of.

33
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:24,864
Smoking cigars,
I think of like a Jay z type character 

34
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,430
on a yacht,
right?

35
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,640
Looking out over the.
Oh,

36
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,220
the beautiful ocean going,
I did it.

37
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,190
I fucking did it.
I mean there's no denying I'm here.

38
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,530
He's got a gold rope around his neck and
he's pumped up.

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,800
He's got some champagne or maybe a nice 
Martini.

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,750
So gentlemen sitting there,
just go with what the fuck.

41
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,100
Get any better.
This is it.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,993
I did it.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,650
I mean,
come on.

44
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,620
He wins.
He wins so hard and that's the beauty of

45
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,454
the cigar is eve.
You could be in your little crappy yard 

46
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,690
and smoking a cigar.
You feel like that.

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,673
But here's my thought.
When we associate the cigar with that 

48
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,020
guy,
think about who makes a cigar.

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,630
You're talking about people who live in 
tiny villages,

50
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:19,560
they'd get paid almost nothing that are 
rolling these things together.

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,600
God bless them.
How much are they getting paid?

52
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,520
I mean,
I know there's some,

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,433
there's some places in Miami where you 
can actually go and you can actually 

54
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:28,380
watch them make cigars.
They'll roll up cigars.

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,570
It's pretty bad ass progressive.
But like,

56
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,880
who is,
who is profiting from this?

57
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,930
Like uh,
yeah,

58
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,764
the big,
the whoever owns the big giant tobacco 

59
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,290
company.
Right?

60
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,110
But they need those people that roll 
those things.

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,820
You do,
but you know,

62
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,490
the little guy who rolling the things,
he,

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,650
he's,
you know,

64
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,000
just making a little living,
doing his little thing he did.

65
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,360
He can't build the whole tobacco 
companies,

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,261
corporate.
Tom,

67
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,094
Tom.
It's essentially like he's a little 

68
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:57,804
worker.
You need to be and you meet the Queen 

69
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,921
Bee.
Right.

70
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,070
But

71
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
isn't that person a lot?
Like what we were talking about with 

72
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,573
standup,
like the comedian is the one who 

73
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,750
actually makes the product was the 
comedy clubs were getting all the money.

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
Right.
And you were in poverty and the comedy 

75
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,900
club was balling out of control.
Yeah.

76
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,890
When you feel like this is bullshit.

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,980
Yes and no,
because in New York,

78
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,520
as you remember,
there was a big riot,

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,800
a big.
Everyone was like,

80
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,340
these clubs are paying us 20 bucks a 
spot that been paying us that forever.

81
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,350
Screw them,
they make money,

82
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,651
blah,
blah,

83
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:34,921
blah,
blah,

84
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:35,754
blah,
and I had a hard time with it because I 

85
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,434
felt like what they're giving us in a 
place to go and do stand up every night 

86
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,373
and have an audience there.
The value I was getting from my act was 

87
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:53,730
so much more valuable than the $20 I was
getting paid.

88
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,330
I didn't care about the 20th.
I wanted them to give me a place where I

89
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:58,164
could go work on my act and then take 
that to some other city or some other 

90
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:03,620
bigger gig and that's where I would make
my mind.

91
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,250
So you know what I mean?
It was.

92
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:08,100
It wasn't purely like,
screw the man,

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,233
the man is giving me a comedy club and 
is run this place for 30 years so I can 

94
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,780
roll in on a Wednesday and have 200 
people.

95
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,100
Well there.
Well there's certainly,

96
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:21,150
I think at different field that you have
for places that are,

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,640
like you're saying,
if you are an icehouse comedian,

98
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,530
you can essentially have like a 
partnership but the ice house,

99
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,290
like I feel like I have a bit of a 
partnership with the Ice House.

100
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,290
Yes.
Will you,

101
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,120
do you sell it out?

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Yeah,
and I love that place and I love Bob The

103
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,194
guy who owns it and I don't mean a 
partnership like I have an ownership in 

104
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,550
it,
but I feel like there is,

105
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,953
I have a bit of an obligation I think we
all do to perform at the great clubs 

106
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,783
just to just to keep them floating and 
keep everybody happy and in t because 

107
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,064
you can and because it's good for you 
and it's good for me and it's good for 

108
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,270
everybody instead of a partnership.
Maybe.

109
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,133
Maybe that's the best word,
but there's some sort of a inexorable 

110
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,230
relationship.
You cannot separate them

111
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
for sure.
Like there's some cities,

112
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,980
you know,
like a hilarity and Cleveland.

113
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,210
Right.
I love that club.

114
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,030
Love the using place.
Nixa greatest guy,

115
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,460
great food too.
They're also,

116
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,670
they,
they're like family.

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,020
It literally is great people.
I have no interest of going to Cleveland

118
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,110
and playing a theater because if I,
if everybody comes up and jumps on nick,

119
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,570
then I'd rather draw,
spend a couple days,

120
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,003
I'll make the same money.
Pretty much I like that is a 

121
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,200
relationship.
Like we've had a relationship throughout

122
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,540
the years for me to jump in and seems 
weird.

123
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,670
It does,
right?

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,590
But there's some other places that,
uh,

125
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,320
you don't feel like that.
I mean,

126
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,010
you know,
also your thing with the ice house,

127
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:50,011
it's like you say you're playing the ice
house now and fight tonight.

128
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,974
It's sold out before it tonight and now 
he's got a really good business going 

129
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,660
there,
you know?

130
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:55,990
Awesome.

131
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,130
I've been able to get guys like you and 
they're onstage

132
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,230
and,
or comes in a lot now.

133
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,140
It's like you get people to realize like
this is an amazing place to practice and

134
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,190
the people are so cool.
It's like the best.

135
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,220
There's a difference in um,
like the feel of the audience like La.

136
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,280
It's like,
wow,

137
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,780
we're at the college tour,
believe it.

138
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,250
We're an ice house.
It's like,

139
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,360
wow,
we're up to see a show.

140
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,290
Really is is a different field.
Totally different.

141
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,124
Yeah.
You feel like you're a almost a little 

142
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,400
on the road.
Yeah.

143
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,140
You know what's like that to Oxnard 
Oxnard?

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,670
Do you ever done that place king,
amazing club,

145
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,620
an hour outside of La and you're on the 
road,

146
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,390
a comedy magic?
Same.

147
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,740
Same thing.
You know?

148
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,140
Any place where when you wake up in the 
morning you're like,

149
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,800
oh,
I got to drive there on the road,

150
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,933
but you know those gigs,
math are so fucking important because 

151
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,150
you have to have a shitty gigs to 
appreciate,

152
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,280
to appreciate the nice ones.

153
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,530
Oh,
absolutely.

154
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,840
On every Gig is good.
Yeah.

155
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,490
Even the worst ones,
but back to your a cigar thing,

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,560
you know there are these little workers 
that are probably making $2 a day.

157
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
That's the point.
We're all in this stuff.

158
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,080
I mean,
I'm just guessing.

159
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,900
I don't really know.
Maybe my dead off and maybe these people

160
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,420
are highly compensated.
Skilled labor.

161
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,220
Well,
it's probably layers of it.

162
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,320
There's probably a guy who's really good
at it.

163
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,183
You know,
who runs everybody who's been there for 

164
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:17,800
30 years as a role and his mother,
motherfucker could just wash.

165
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,891
Right?
You know,

166
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,960
dudes who could just roll joints.
Ever meet those guys.

167
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,840
So impressive.
Like a cigarette.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,690
They slide it out their mouth.
I have no skill.

169
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,740
I am fucking ape fingered retarded when 
it comes to rolling joints.

170
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,574
I used to be good at it,
but I watched some people like Tony 

171
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,890
Hinchcliffe gonna enroll a fucking fat 
joint yet Jamie.

172
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,110
First roles.
Goddamn good joint.

173
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,930
I used to be good at it.
You know what the problem with me,

174
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,210
man?
I got one of those roller things,

175
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,590
those little machine with the fingers.
The best ones are with the fingers.

176
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,483
There's one year I have that.
You could go like that and you put the 

177
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,230
rolling paper in,
you put the uh,

178
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,760
the,
the Wieden and then you know,

179
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,040
you lick the paper and then you just go 
like that bump bump.

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,300
And it does it all really all by itself.
Yeah.

181
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,760
It rolls it up.
So advanced.

182
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah.
It's so good.

183
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,180
I'm like,
I'm not rolling this out my hand.

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,033
What am I an asshole when you're smoking
by yourself or with sticks when you're 

185
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,570
by yourself to your role or do you just 
take like one?

186
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,413
I already rolled.
Are you buying them already rolled from 

187
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:17,330
la speed.

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163
We'd for all your delivery services of 
headspring when you buy them already 

189
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,490
rolled like you don't have to think 
about it.

190
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,590
I don't want to think about shit.
Yeah,

191
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,960
but some people have the ritual,
the ritual of that.

192
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:31,220
I used to love the deep it on an album I
used to and they had albums.

193
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,950
What has replaced the album for rolling?
We'd on and then it went to CD cover.

194
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,784
You would do it on a CD cover and now 
people use those actual weed theme 

195
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:43,700
trace.
That seems kind of Corny to me.

196
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,743
Yeah.
Like you should steal some shit from a 

197
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,424
cafeteria.
Have like a pirates of the Caribbean or 

198
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,740
nate's little tray.
You know what you should have man.

199
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,663
He get one of them aluminum ones from 
prison because you're in a prison of 

200
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,320
your own mind,
man.

201
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,810
A real like standard issue.
Aluminum,

202
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,290
prison trade for fake mashed potatoes 
went to prison.

203
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,570
Of your own mind,
man,

204
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,630
man,
you got to free your mind.

205
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,550
Do you have a cutter?
A do not.

206
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,460
Oh yeah,
I know I do.

207
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,580
I could show it off.
When I think about the cigar though,

208
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:22,414
I don't think of a Jay Z so much as a 
like it's a wonderful life like the 

209
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:27,634
banker and that's wonderful line.
We had a box with a cutter in it and 

210
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,540
some other bullshit that I bring that 
in.

211
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,070
I can bite it off if you bite it off 
though.

212
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,400
I feel like it's one of those things.
When I started,

213
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:40,234
I'm out of school.
I worked in advertising for a little 

214
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,830
while and I used to have to go to this 
nursing home.

215
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:48,040
We did.
It was small advertising and we would go

216
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:48,874
to a nursing home and we would do all 
the ad campaign for this guy who owns 

217
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:55,330
like five nursing homes.
He was a really rich guy and he looked a

218
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:56,164
little like a frog.
He was like an older guy came up in the 

219
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:59,050
war and he used to,
you know,

220
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,933
first you started with trucks,
now he owned nursing homes and he was 

221
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:03,274
just like an old school guy,
big glasses and he always had a cigar 

222
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,963
all day long.
He'd walk around with a cigar and his 

223
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,870
mouth just chomping on it.
Not what he would just chomp,

224
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:11,561
chomp,
chomp,

225
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,050
it and it would be like kind of scuzzy 
at the end,

226
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,200
but then eventually no cutter at the 
end.

227
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,063
He'd been chewing at show long.
We just spit it out and then light it 

228
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:22,020
up.

229
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,853
Hmm.
Yeah.

230
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,530
What a Weirdo.
Fine.

231
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,450
Don't worry about Jamie.
It might be the other.

232
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,284
Combined it off.
Don't worry about it in the kitchen 

233
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,740
doing it already.
Yeah.

234
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:34,510
We'll just bite it off.
Just go old school.

235
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

236
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,750
Old School.
Bugsy shingle type.

237
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,390
We do feel like a big shot with a cigar.
Why is that?

238
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,490
Why do you feel like a big shot?
I don't know.

239
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,390
I feel gross spitting it out till I know
here's a tissue weed in their son.

240
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,463
Jamie,
can we find out whether or not cigar 

241
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:58,924
rollers are abused and underpaid?
Scar industry's going to be pissed at 

242
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,464
us.
No.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,050
Sure.
Or weird thing,

244
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:08,884
right?
It's like a cigar is like a a thing at 

245
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,070
that point.
Right.

246
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,860
But it's also like a,
like a guy thing or.

247
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:17,920
Yes.
Chick who can hang thing bro.

248
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,040
She smoked cigar.
Come on girl with Leggy and open blouse.

249
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:24,394
Like wearing glasses,
like smoking a cigar with men's rolex 

250
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,960
hat on like a fucking dodgers hat on.
Yes.

251
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,580
He's screaming facts about the broncos.
Yeah.

252
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:37,150
With like those cheerleader type socks.
Go all the way up to her knees.

253
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,880
No,
that girl's fun to hang with one night.

254
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,370
But you don't want that girl for the 
long haul.

255
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,290
Well she's a sprinter.

256
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,570
Not a marathon runner.
Yeah.

257
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,404
Yeah.
You want to date an ultra marathon 

258
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:54,070
runner so it's just slow and,
and they just keep

259
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,070
that pace and they will not quit arms in
tight.

260
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,293
Just go and little steps with no 
underwear on and sweat socks with your 

261
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,780
shirt on.
And she's smoking a cigar.

262
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,360
Like,
all right,

263
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,940
you're not coming to thanksgiving.
I don't think this is going to make it.

264
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,430
This one's not going to be.
Yeah,

265
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,700
you're going to be fun for a little 
while,

266
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,773
but it's like a rollercoaster.
Would you want to ride a rollercoaster 

267
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,620
eight hours a day for the rest of your 
life?

268
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,110
You'll be nauseous all the time.
Yeah,

269
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,073
I mean that's.
That's the function that crazy people 

270
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,180
have in your life.
They're valuable,

271
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,830
but you don't want to be around them 
constantly.

272
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,730
Now a hell of a lot of funding.
You pack up the car and go visit once in

273
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,620
a while and that's it.
Yeah,

274
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,450
pretty crazy.
People are exhausting,

275
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,670
man.
Totally exhausting.

276
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,143
I remember this crazy girl once and it 
went on longer than it should and she 

277
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,230
was intensely fun.

278
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,390
I mean crazy.
Just,

279
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,980
you know,
insane.

280
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,910
Everything about it was fun and insane.
Yeah,

281
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,720
and I stayed in too long and by the end 
of it I was like,

282
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,390
he just got it.
You got to go.

283
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,520
I was almost in tears.
That was like,

284
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,470
you gotta get Outta here.
I can't.

285
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,610
I can't live like this because it wasn't
just the like the crazy fun drought.

286
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,473
It was directed at you at a certain 
point and they want them to put the 

287
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,970
crazy on you and analyze and fight and 
stuff.

288
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,020
Some people definitely want to fight.
I can't live in with fight fighter.

289
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:17,854
I'm not either.
Some people think that you're supposed 

290
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,800
to.
That's how a relationship is supposed to

291
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,340
be fighting.
Do you somehow or another you don't care

292
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:26,620
about each other because if you care you
get upset.

293
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,083
So very weird sort of dynamic.
The man and woman relationship dynamic 

294
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,340
of things that people think you 
shouldn't,

295
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:37,120
shouldn't expect the way people behave 
or don't behave the way they talk to you

296
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,400
or don't talk to you like it's very 
hard.

297
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,151
You know?
It's weird.

298
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:43,090
It's as if it's all the same.
If any friendship is the same.

299
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,660
Yeah.
Don't let,

300
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,930
don't let people be mean to you.
Don't let them fucking beat you down.

301
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,160
You'll shit at you.
But some people like if you grow up in a

302
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:54,430
home that fights all the time,
you get used to that and then you.

303
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,040
It's not a big deal.
She was,

304
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,970
this girl was she fight screaming,
yelling at and like as soon as it was,

305
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,680
it was done,
she'd be fine.

306
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,040
Just like I have some coffee and just 
sit there and I'd be shaking like,

307
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,470
oh my God,
why did she say you?

308
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,360
I'm not good with that kind of tension 
that at all.

309
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,400
I used to date this girl would get 
really mad,

310
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,670
really mad and want to fight and then 
once,

311
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,820
once there was some sort of resolution 
should immediately turned docile.

312
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,103
It was very odd,
like she'd be aggressive to like start 

313
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,530
some sort of altercation,
but you could calm the altercation down,

314
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,880
shut it down.
Yeah.

315
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,773
But you had to almost shut it down by 
just saying or you're not going to do 

316
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,250
this.
I'm not going to talk like this.

317
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,500
Like this child was young.
Sorry.

318
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,390
I needed to learn like how to talk to 
people or how to manage situations.

319
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,510
Like sometimes something's happening 
between two people,

320
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:49,931
like,
uh,

321
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,230
you're,
you're upset about something.

322
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,130
And instead of

323
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,780
thinking about how you're conveying your
thought to them,

324
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,270
all you think of is what you want to 
happen.

325
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,210
I want you to shut the fuck up.
I know.

326
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,570
Even though you want someone to shut the
fuck up.

327
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,404
The problem is when you say that you're 
not really thinking about communicating 

328
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:18,920
with them through their eyes wants 
anyone to say shut the fuck up,

329
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:19,754
but we.
Because we want people to shut the fuck 

330
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,280
up and you can't deal with it.
I,

331
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,114
I'm know.
Yeah.

332
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,770
Is a point you don't want.
You don't care what their needs are.

333
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,390
You just stop.
Well,

334
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,224
it's.
Well it's also like when people want 

335
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,460
people to do things so they want people.
There's,

336
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,340
there's the,
the mindset of you wanting a result.

337
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,323
You want someone to behave a certain way
instead of thinking about them as like 

338
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,363
your equal.
I can just another human being and 

339
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,130
instead of thinking like I have to get 
what I want,

340
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,350
like what is it that you want?

341
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,140
Okay,
what,

342
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,760
what happened here?
Like why are we pass?

343
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,790
I find like impasse getting older,
that thing I'm more aware of your.

344
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,020
It's that big part of not thinking about
you all the time.

345
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,153
You're always think,
especially when you're young and you're 

346
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:10,340
like coming up and you're doing,
it's just me,

347
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:10,671
me,
me,

348
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,050
me it,
because you're just trying to survive.

349
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:12,884
You're trying to figure.
You don't even know what you want when 

350
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:18,980
you shut that part down and think about 
the person across from you.

351
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,680
Yeah,
it opens up the whole world,

352
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,400
but it's a difficult thing to learn when
you're young.

353
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,490
Contradictory to success like you think,
but not like it's.

354
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,440
I think it's like if you don't think 
about yourself,

355
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:34,460
no one will.
You know,

356
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,294
there's that kind of thought process.
Just get really good at shit the best 

357
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,490
way.
Here's the ironic thing,

358
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,150
one of the best ways to get really good 
at Shit is shutting that voice down.

359
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,961
Yeah,
good.

360
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,430
Shout it out.
Especially with the voice.

361
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,290
That voice like me,
me,

362
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,440
me and this and that,
and I want people to listen to me.

363
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,963
Shut that thing down.
The more you can shut that thing down 

364
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,664
into more whatever you do,
you concentrate on it going to work and 

365
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,510
nobody does it perfect.
Nobody does it perfectly.

366
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,120
It's not only that they don't do a 
perfect.

367
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:05,954
It's that you have to constantly reteach
yourself that you have to constantly 

368
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:12,950
bring yourself back,
bring yourself back.

369
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,813
It's a.
it's a.

370
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,940
it's a trick.
It's an ongoing exercise.

371
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,893
It really is and that's why it's like A.
I was watching this interview with Nate 

372
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,213
Diaz,
UFC fighter.

373
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,373
He's hilarious and nate was talking 
about watching himself on the ultimate 

374
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,580
fighter from 10 years ago and he's like,
please shut that shit off.

375
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,843
He goes,
anybody watch a video of yourself from 

376
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,170
10 years ago?
You'd be like,

377
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:39,590
shut that shit up.
And I was thinking he's so right.

378
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,600
That's such an obvious thing like nobody
likes to see themselves from a long time

379
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:47,270
ago because we're all a work in 
progress,

380
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,190
but when you were in that moment when 
that video

381
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,790
was taken of you,
you thought you had to go and on,

382
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,440
you thought you were doing right?
For sure.

383
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,303
I mean,
right now we think we're in the moment 

384
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,210
like we're doing fine,
but if you were to look back at this,

385
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:03,480
there'd be something wrong.
I'm upset that the cigar has two bands.

386
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,770
I feel I took the first band off 
immediately,

387
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,460
dark and go fuck itself because of that.
It's too fancy.

388
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:10,800
It's outrageous.
I am really enjoying to bands.

389
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,340
How about you take the money from one of
these bands and pay those dudes?

390
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:18,670
Roll this mother far such a socialist.
I'm turning comedy as I get older.

391
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,290
It's happening.
Alright.

392
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,173
Yeah.
I'm shifting.

393
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,250
Red Shifting.
Yeah.

394
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:22,841
Yeah,
yeah.

395
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:23,674
You know,
what I shift towards lately more than 

396
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:28,110
anything is like kindness to our fellow 
humans.

397
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,030
That is the exact word I have been using
all month.

398
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,630
Act out of kindness,
politicians,

399
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,400
people,
grocers,

400
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,450
my family.

401
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,330
Just be kind.
Just be kind.

402
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,790
Yeah,
and I think the more we recognize that,

403
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,624
the more we see evidence of that,
even an idea even in like groups or you 

404
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,504
know,
chunks of people that share our mindset 

405
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,400
on other things and we don't want to 
call it,

406
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,713
we don't want to call them out on it,
like say if you're a republican and 

407
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,344
there's like some Republican candidate 
or something that's running for 

408
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:04,404
president,
but they're really shady in one way or 

409
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,340
the corrupt or what,
and you know,

410
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,620
you don't want to talk about it because 
it's a part of your party.

411
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,170
That's insane.
You can't.

412
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:14,160
Yeah.
You.

413
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,660
Well,
you know,

414
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,740
tribalism inside our own civilization is
fucking bananas.

415
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,603
I feel like that's like the most 
disturbing thing of the all the 

416
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:27,630
discourse now is that people are so 
entrenched in these teams.

417
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,200
You're a sucker if you're that in,
on any of these teams.

418
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,260
No team is partly,
you've got a flow.

419
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,223
Do you think that's because people were 
scared and so they feel like they feel 

420
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:40,710
more comfort in being a part of some 
rigid team,

421
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,300
like,
like say if you're a right.

422
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,800
That's what I see in like a lot of these
white supremacists see fear.

423
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,933
You guys were walking in their holdings 
flags and there were these torches and 

424
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,860
they're yelling things.
See fear.

425
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,270
Yeah,
I really do.

426
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,390
It's a big part of what it is.
They're coming for me.

427
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:00,240
They're coming for us.
They're pushing us out.

428
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,670
We're supposed to all be the same thing.
We looked different.

429
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,960
Jesus Christ.
That's it.

430
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,873
I mean,
and all the other differences that we 

431
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,534
have like left and right and ideologies 
and how can you be all in on any 

432
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,030
political organization?
Like how can you,

433
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,870
how it's faith.
It's just like,

434
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,600
what's that a Malian on weed.
Well,

435
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,421
alright,
team weed.

436
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,254
You can go for it.
You really don't understand it like you 

437
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:27,474
really have.
And what's really upsetting about it is 

438
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,590
it goes completely against what we're 
talking about.

439
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,890
Listening to the other person,
like really listening to them.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,770
There's a,
there's a guy on my block,

441
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,200
older guy,
he's retired,

442
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,363
he's got his little dog.
He walks this little dog every day and 

443
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:44,640
he always,
Hey,

444
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,170
you know,
we've only been there a couple of years.

445
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,220
Good Morning Tom.
Morning Bob

446
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,620
and he just walks with his dog and he's 
just like this nice.

447
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,260
He's the guy from.
He's in my movie of my life.

448
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,470
He's the extra.
The walks the guy.

449
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,463
My wife saw that he had a trump poster 
in his garage and my wife was all in on 

450
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,140
Hillary.
He was like,

451
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:06,880
I don't think I can.
I don't think I can.

452
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,730
I can talk to him.
I was like,

453
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,920
yes you can.
That doesn't mean any.

454
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,400
So what?
So that's what he went for.

455
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,130
Him Did it.
So what?

456
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,450
He's bald,
the guy with the dog,

457
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,613
he's a loving person who really is 
excited to see us in our children and 

458
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:24,460
our dog in the morning.
Stop using that thing,

459
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:25,294
this one isolated thing as to as a 
marker for whether or not this person 

460
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,810
can enter your life in any way.

461
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,863
The only way you should is if that 
person is trying to force that on you 

462
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,170
and make you believe what they believe 
and if you don't support trump,

463
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,760
then they hate you and then then it 
becomes.

464
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,950
It's virtually interchangeable with 
religion.

465
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,850
Yeah,
right.

466
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,683
Like if your next door neighbor's a Jew 
and the guy on the other side of you is 

467
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:49,004
a baptist and you're an atheist and 
there's no reason why you can't all be 

468
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:55,310
great friends,
great friends hanging out was like,

469
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:55,970
Hey,
what's up?

470
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,803
You guys want to come over?
We're going to do some hot dogs or 

471
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:01,640
whatever that are kosher.
Who gives a shit?

472
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,260
Who gives a shit shit and isn't it more 
effective?

473
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,730
If you are really politically minded and
really want your,

474
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,270
your really love Hillary and you love 
what she stood for and you want that,

475
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,313
isn't it more effective to invite this 
guy into your life and let him see that 

476
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,700
he has a lot more in common with this 
liberal family.

477
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,563
Sit at the end of the block.
Then putting up walls and keeping them 

478
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:25,910
out.

479
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:26,743
I think that people were given a real 
disservice by being forced to choose 

480
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,073
only on on one side or the other.
One of them is Donald Trump and the 

481
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:37,330
other one is Hillary Clinton.
This,

482
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,040
this like hustle system that they put 
together.

483
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,970
A two party system is the reason why 
it's so difficult because a party has to

484
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:47,000
choose a candidate you have to vote on 
in the primaries,

485
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,983
so you have to be registered.
Not that many people are thinking what 

486
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,640
the actual numbers of people that vote 
in the primaries.

487
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,190
It's a fraction of the people that vote 
in the general election.

488
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,230
Right?
And that's a fraction of the population.

489
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,783
And so if you forced to choose between 
like this really lackluster candidate 

490
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:02,931
and people say,
oh,

491
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:03,764
she had all this experience,
regardless of what you think about 

492
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,880
Hillary supported her or not you,
you'd have to look at it objectively and

493
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:11,450
say,
well,

494
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,520
she's a deeply flawed candidate.

495
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,320
I mean,
she had a lot of issues.

496
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:16,154
There's a lot of credibility issues.
She didn't support gay marriage until 

497
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:18,974
2013.
That was one of my big red flag because 

498
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm like,
how?

499
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,040
Why do you care?
Why do you care?

500
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,720
Like if you really care,
if you really think,

501
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:28,554
I really believe that gay people 
shouldn't have the same rights in terms 

502
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:34,640
of like bonding in a relationship than a
straight person.

503
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,560
Well,
that's a crazy person's idea.

504
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,140
Like what do you give a shit that 
doesn't make any sense?

505
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,870
What is it?
Why is it,

506
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,390
there's no proof that marriage is 
putting this gigantic burden on our,

507
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,383
on us and why do you want,
what do you care about how these people 

508
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:48,720
live?
Why,

509
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,553
why is leave him be so kind to me.
And then like when you hear the 

510
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:54,494
difference between what Cami said about 
the investigation and when the results 

511
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:57,914
were versus what she said,
like there's a video where it plays it 

512
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:00,614
back to back where she says that 
everything was fine and everything was 

513
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:08,270
no big deal and he was like his fucking 
huge deal and they like,

514
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:09,530
she would say that,
you know,

515
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,030
this,
there was no evidence of this.

516
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,120
And he said there was evidence of this 
and multiple occasions and it's like you

517
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,350
look at the two of them back to back,
Yo,

518
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,184
what the fuck man?
And people got mad at me for making a 

519
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,690
big deal out of that.
Like there's a lot of people that say,

520
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:21,510
hey man,
you know,

521
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,343
you're partially responsible when people
like you for pointing out all this 

522
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:25,910
Hillary Clinton Shit.
Like,

523
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,190
no,
no,

524
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,023
we're talking about reality.
Not are not responsible for reality 

525
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,780
sucking will.
It comes to that,

526
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,673
but the idea is the opposite is don't 
talk about it at all and pretend it 

527
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:39,030
doesn't exist.
Problem

528
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,863
with,
with all these people being pitted 

529
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:43,910
against each other,
they can't see the other side and have a

530
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:48,911
little bit of flow.
I feel like it also has become this.

531
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,713
It's almost like news is entertainment 
now when we watch a 24 hour news 

532
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,054
programs and stuff,
it's like rooting for the bears are 

533
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,510
rooting for the steelers.
You know what I mean?

534
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:03,080
Like it's become this passionate,
you know,

535
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,330
sport,
entertaining sport.

536
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,450
It's kind of a,
it's kind of upsetting,

537
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,360
but I mean it's very upsetting that Sean
Hannity Guy.

538
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,510
Yeah.
How has that guy any more different than

539
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,344
a.
like a local football broadcaster who's 

540
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,880
really excited about the Patriots?
Patriots is Tina asked,

541
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,003
oh my God is going to be great.
They're not going to be stopped 

542
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,973
patriots.
They say what they want about Brady 

543
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,970
didn't plate those balls.
It's completely.

544
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah,
no,

545
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,080
he's like a fucking Rah Rah Republican 
character,

546
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,660
right?

547
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,493
Just like almost like a football guy.
One hundred percent all in whatever the 

548
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:40,184
fuck the Republican point is.
He's all in and you're not going to 

549
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,090
convince him to like the New York 
giants.

550
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:46,880
He's a patriots guy.
That's just the way it goes.

551
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,043
But I really feel like you got to go 
through life and rather than thinking 

552
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,060
about,
and I want to be too preachy,

553
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:55,820
but not to be.
You shouldn't be going by.

554
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,850
My party should be going by the acts of 
these people.

555
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,510
So everybody,
everybody's like,

556
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:03,860
uh,
uh,

557
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,610
you.
So you can hate that.

558
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,220
That pruitt is going after public lands,
enrolling back all this EPA stuff.

559
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,050
And then you see trump or make a deal 
yesterday with Pelosi and Schumer saying

560
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,583
we're going to try and make sure that 
these Daca kids are allowed to stay it 

561
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,150
through everybody.
Like,

562
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,901
wait,
wait,

563
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:25,300
what?
But I know,

564
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,373
but I still have to hate them.
But Nancy Pelosi's office making a deal 

565
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:29,331
with them.
Well,

566
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,250
that's how you should act.
It should be.

567
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,530
He should be allowed to do something 
kind.

568
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,633
He should be allowed to.
You should be allowed to call him out 

569
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:40,550
when he does something shitty.
It shouldn't be just this blanket.

570
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,990
I love the guy.
No matter what.

571
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,190
Well you.
Someone said,

572
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,243
I forget who it was,
I forget who the person was that had 

573
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:47,874
this idea,
but the idea was that one of the good 

574
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,784
things about trump would be that he is 
concerned with public opinion and so if 

575
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,244
he floats an idea out there and it's not
popular or it's really damaging public 

576
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,124
opinion of him,
he'll take a second look at which is a 

577
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:07,010
very non politician like thing to do.
You know,

578
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,933
when people point to terrible things 
that he's done in the past almost as 

579
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:13,840
like evidence that he can evolve,
you know,

580
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,130
like evidence that he's a sociopath,
we're fucking doomed.

581
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,530
If that's the case,
we're doomed.

582
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,480
If human beings and human beings in 
general,

583
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:23,460
general right and we're doomed with 
mean.

584
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,040
If you can't learn at 70 is,
is it over?

585
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,900
Like there's a difference when you're 
20,

586
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,910
you could figure things out when you're 
30,

587
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:30,744
you know,
I'm better than I was when I was 20 

588
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,280
know,
but when you get to 70 no,

589
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,150
then it's no.

590
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,860
Yeah,
there's no more learning in like a super

591
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:38,694
extreme scenario.
Like the president of the free world is 

592
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,723
terrifying.
I mean he's the leader of the free 

593
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:45,384
world.
Yeah.

594
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,980
At 70,
at 70,

595
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,843
and with a bunch of people that hate 
them and then talking about like 

596
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,383
shipping immigrant kids back.
There's people that were born here when 

597
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,120
they were to know there are brought here
rather when they were two,

598
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,580
they were born another country.
They don't know the other country at all

599
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,550
and they'll send them back to it.
It's crazy scary.

600
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,770
It's very scary.
It's scary because it's not.

601
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,560
There's no empathy to that.
Like these people are terror.

602
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,040
It's one thing if someone is some sort 
of a dangerous criminal,

603
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,000
we'll.
If that's the case,

604
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,610
they should be in fucking jail.
That's what jail is for.

605
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,090
Why would you just set them free in 
Mexico?

606
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,170
That sounds crazy.

607
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,040
And we have this girl in her life who 
was born here,

608
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:28,750
she was part of that and has since 
gotten her citizenship.

609
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:29,584
So she was safe but just recently.
So as soon as they came in and started 

610
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,740
saying where we might send them back,
it was like Tara.

611
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,180
Tara was like hiding in our house,
like can I just sleep here?

612
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:38,014
She was so nervous just to sleep in her 
little apartment somewhere because he 

613
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,250
thought they were gonna come and get her

614
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,123
to.
The friend of mine is a contractor and 

615
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:47,600
you went to Home Depot and now was in.
He's in Home Depot.

616
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,180
He gets out of his car and these ice 
guys.

617
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,163
I mean this guy is a distinguished 
looking handsome man in his fifties and 

618
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,440
speaks perfect English.
They,

619
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,500
they flash their fucking badges,
you know,

620
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:05,890
he makes them shows the first they just 
said you have to.

621
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:06,724
And he goes,
listen,

622
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,110
just came up to him in the parking lot.
He listen dumb ass.

623
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:10,640
He's like,
he's former military.

624
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:11,474
He was like,
I told them because I was in the 

625
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:12,920
military,
like,

626
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,980
you guys can't just do this.
This is not something you do.

627
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,150
You don't just come up to someone and 
ask,

628
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:18,380
where were you born?
Is that what they.

629
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,090
That's how they led up to him.
Were you born?

630
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,890
Show me your Id.
Oh my God.

631
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,200
And he was like,
what the fuck are you guys doing?

632
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,180
He goes,
I'm going to show you my military id.

633
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,163
Okay,
here you go.

634
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,850
Now here's my id.
Okay,

635
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,863
now what the fuck are you guys doing?
You can't do this because this is 

636
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,510
totally illegal.
It's,

637
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,393
it's insane.
Just grabbing people out of their cars 

638
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:39,830
for no reason.
Your life looking brown,

639
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,560
Bro.
You look at over there,

640
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,090
Bro.

641
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,960
See that's not kind.
Let them Brown Brown.

642
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:47,830
Were you born?
I asked him where he was born.

643
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,750
We're crazy served in our military.
Exactly the same fucking control.

644
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,920
First of all,
I was born in America.

645
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,270
He was absolutely.
Yeah,

646
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,920
but he has to prove that.
Approve it because he's Brown and.

647
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:03,490
But just ask him where.
Where did your parents have you?

648
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:05,590
It's the one thing that you cannot 
control.

649
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,090
I shouldn't have immigrants.
Don't use that.

650
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,090
Right,
exactly.

651
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,630
We went right.
We might be anything with immigration.

652
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,100
My parents,
my parents,

653
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,800
parents were born here.
Exactly.

654
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,763
Native Americans are the only ones who 
who were legitimately here long enough 

655
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:27,280
to claim it came across the bering land 
bridge from Asia.

656
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:31,930
So for spot it's nobody's fucking 
assholes.

657
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,270
Yeah.
Just taking a brown guy.

658
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,133
Right Subaru.
I'm sure if you took those guys with 

659
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,090
those officials,
they have to have the same story.

660
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,460
We all came from somewhere else.
I know.

661
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:43,840
It's insane.
So crazy.

662
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,674
This guy's not doing a crime like you're
just assuming that he's some sort of an 

663
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:50,080
illegal immigrant because he's at home 
depot.

664
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,030
Fuck.
He fixes things himself.

665
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:57,580
He just fucking contract.
He can't be an American.

666
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,030
We just throw our shit out.
He still has the fixes TV.

667
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,113
If that's not.
Is that racial profiling or is that 

668
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:09,780
racist?
I feel like it's more race.

669
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:10,614
I think it's more racist because look,
racist really means that you are using 

670
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,343
power to put people down for the race 
and when we say racist is just saying 

671
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:21,680
something shitty about somebody,
it's not really.

672
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:22,514
It's,
it's when you really have power over 

673
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:26,990
people and use that and that's what that
is.

674
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,580
One hundred percent and it's,
it's like a target and here's the thing,

675
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:33,710
man,
maybe he's right.

676
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,170
Thirty percent of the time that he does 
this,

677
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,423
maybe that cop does that all the time 
and catches these guys that are there 

678
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,144
that are illegal immigrants and they're 
just there to try to hustle and work on 

679
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:46,790
people's houses,
but that's why we have laws.

680
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,623
It's like exact the guy who a waste 
wasted resource unless they're 

681
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:52,070
criminals,
they're criminals.

682
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:55,850
While there are people who were fucked,
fucked at birth,

683
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,080
at birth,
at birth,

684
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,430
that's the way they came,
right?

685
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,690
They're stuck in some poor country and 
they figured out a way to get across the

686
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:05,450
border illegally.
Can you imagine?

687
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,493
Can you imagine how desperate people 
must be in these other countries that 

688
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:14,990
you would you as a father,
you would tell your kids,

689
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,670
go with this man and hopefully get over 
to that other country for a better life.

690
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,533
Could you imagine how desperate you 
would have to be to tell your children 

691
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,130
go,
that is a desperate,

692
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:28,964
desperate situation and it just is a 
roll of the dice that you were born 50 

693
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:37,310
miles that way.
Or like my friend Justin,

694
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:39,170
who makes these wells for people in the 
Congo.

695
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,010
Well,
just

696
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,843
having fresh water changes their life.
The one thing that we absolutely take 

697
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,280
for granted,
you give it away free at restaurants.

698
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,360
Exactly did that.
We give away to everybody for free.

699
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,630
The thing that changes their life and 
the Congo,

700
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:56,460
a fresh clean glass of water,
nothing.

701
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,330
Nothing to everything you've put you 
clean your asshole.

702
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,820
Whether it was Japanese toilets,
you have one of those.

703
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,930
Oh,
it's the fast,

704
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,270
vast.
I moved into a house.

705
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:06,104
I didn't.
We didn't know what it was and we were 

706
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,360
just looking around and we walked into 
the bathroom and the lid open.

707
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,780
Oh,
and it sees you.

708
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,770
It's one of those is warm.
Oh,

709
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:16,820
it's heaven.
It is.

710
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,113
It's almost sexual because that warm 
waters shoot into your asshole and 

711
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,730
here's the thing is like an.
There's only an on off button.

712
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,120
It doesn't go,
hey fucker enough,

713
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,993
it's creepy how many people are just 
sitting there with rod shooting out of 

714
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,910
their ass all stroking their shaft.

715
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,863
Must Be.
It must be like the number one tool for 

716
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,030
masturbation and everybody around the 
world does it,

717
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
but Americans,
it's not right.

718
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:46,894
The day is not a main thing in America.
Well we prefer to do is chop down trees 

719
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,900
and make a fine paper that we smear shit
over asshole.

720
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,040
Walk up and talk about your day with 
fecal matter all over the fucking room.

721
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,110
Radically cut down on the amount of 
fecal matter available.

722
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,220
If we just had jets of water,
that was the rest of the world.

723
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,310
Just fly it out.
But the rest of you how they do that but

724
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:14,630
day thing,
which is awkward.

725
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:15,464
It's like the most ergonomic thing ever 
created with metal pipe thing is right 

726
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,960
where your asshole goes and there's 
nowhere to sit.

727
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,200
It seems much nastier.
The first time you walk into a hotel and

728
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:28,310
saw that as a kid,
you were like,

729
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,730
I don't care if I'm cleaning or I'm not 
doing that.

730
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,780
I was in a hotel in New York City,
I forgot the hotel,

731
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:41,110
but they had some crazy setup where 
there was not just a bad day,

732
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,223
but they had to fucking hoses one on 
either side of the bowl when that hard 

733
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:49,754
metal.
So you've got to have a day over here 

734
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,173
and you got a bath with these two 
fucking carwash hoses right next to the 

735
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,690
toilet.
How clean the after me.

736
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,673
But it's like,
I mean he just shoot water everywhere 

737
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:05,990
while you're shooting.
What are you doing with those two?

738
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:06,824
What did you do it in there?
It's like one the right hand to left 

739
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:12,530
hand and why?
I don't like cleaning my asshole with my

740
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,850
right hand and do it and I have to go 
left,

741
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,240
grab this and strangle myself as I 
cleaned my,

742
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,074
but I'm not.
I keep my phone and I looked this up 

743
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,100
when that happened.
I remember that.

744
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,360
Yeah,
the answer.

745
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,040
I don't know if it's even better than 
the day.

746
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,110
It's to clean this shit off the inside 
of the toilet.

747
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,360
That many,
not one of them is.

748
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,330
That's why it's so hard to keep it clean
the whole time.

749
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,470
You get the second one's for,
but that's what one of them is for.

750
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,130
That's a

751
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,960
shitty way to do it.
Pardon my pun.

752
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,360
These,
these people are eating the wrong foods.

753
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,840
Oh yeah.
Thank you guys.

754
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,490
Or would you.
Would you ever,

755
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:51,324
um,
have you ever thought about going to 

756
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,880
other countries and doing volunteer 
work?

757
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,980
What does that just came out yesterday 
or the day before?

758
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:05,700
You guys talk about shit.
One hundred and 40 town fat bird ton.

759
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,040
One hundred.
One hundred 40 ton.

760
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,903
Oh my God.
Fatberg has been discovered under the 

761
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,910
streets of London.
What does that mean?

762
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,830
It's oil,
fat.

763
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,680
Tampons.
Wet Wipes,

764
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,640
diapers.
Oh,

765
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,050
it's a.
and it's stuck in this.

766
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,450
It's like concrete now they said it's 
stuck in this pipe.

767
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,510
Oh my 420 burned this size of two 
football pitches.

768
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:27,804
Is that mainly a soccer 100?
It looks like the Globes that bigger or 

769
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:33,780
shorter than American.
I think it's a little longer.

770
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,950
Of course it is.
And wider was found in London sewers.

771
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,470
Jesus Christ.
And is it blocking something shit now?

772
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,643
Oh my God,
we gotta get rid of it on this big 

773
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,600
section or the pipes under there.
Holy Shit Man.

774
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,020
A Ui that is like the ultimate clogged 
drain is so nasty,

775
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:54,700
but it is,
right?

776
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah,
exactly.

777
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,863
No plungers get mad out.
Did I ever show you the picture of the 

778
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:01,410
tree that was growing in my toilet pipe?
No tree.

779
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,430
No Dude.
I was having a problem.

780
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,960
My toilet wouldn't flush correctly,
so I had a fellow come over to take care

781
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,400
of it and he said,
dude,

782
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,353
he goes,
look at that.

783
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,650
That's an actual picture of the thing 
that was in my bathroom.

784
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,543
What is it?
That is a tree that's roots got into a 

785
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:27,550
small crack in the water pipe and they,
they,

786
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,680
they continue to grow where the pipe is,
crack it and once they crack it,

787
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:36,681
something goes inside and then it grows 
where the water up the pipe.

788
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,390
So the pipe was clogged with like a 
tree.

789
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,700
It looked like an animal.
Oh my God.

790
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,970
It's disgusting.
So for years you were,

791
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,270
you thought it was going that right out 
of a pipe and it was.

792
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:50,010
Shows you what I'm eating is super 
healthy.

793
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,020
You're literally shooting trees.
All the vitamins that come out.

794
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,640
My piss my pants is always a bright 
orange.

795
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,630
It's the take so many vitamins.
It's the happiest route I ever saw.

796
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,473
It went hog wild.
It's like almost proof that what I'm 

797
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:07,254
doing.
It's like little shop of horrors like 

798
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,430
feed me Joe.
I don't think I was.

799
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,990
Yeah.
Wow.

800
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,540
I don't think I was eating wild game 
back then.

801
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,400
Either one or what it would look like 
now.

802
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,443
It was happier in the.
In your toilet that it was out in 

803
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:23,650
nature.
What if you change your diet?

804
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:28,651
It turned different colors.
What if it's like it's only growing back

805
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,514
color because if you shit it didn't.
Maybe with like you're like a high beat 

806
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:33,940
concentrate.
Die.

807
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,220
That's so big.
It looks like it has a personality

808
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,670
telling the rest of the trees.
Get in here bro.

809
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,490
I'm so happy.
Do you have a thought of nutrients?

810
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,800
There's water and shit done.
Love it.

811
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,960
Wait a minute.
In a pipe.

812
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,230
Yeah.
You live in a stew of water and shit and

813
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:53,830
they keep dropping shit on you every day
and you absorb it.

814
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,753
No way will you live there bro.
There's no dirt water and they let you 

815
00:38:58,901 --> 00:38:59,380
live.
No,

816
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,820
he has no idea on there,
bro.

817
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm telling you.
Dirt sucks.

818
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,410
Fuck dirt when you need to do is grow in
a shit pipe.

819
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,180
Fuck Dude.
That sounds like shit.

820
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,290
Pipe pipe for a tree is like being Jz 
with a cigar for a regular person.

821
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,653
Says,
oh,

822
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,840
so happy.
He found the ship pipe.

823
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,040
He's out there hustling.
He made his way up to shit.

824
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,610
Pipe.
You hear about Harry?

825
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,503
Yeah Bro.
He worked at that fucking pipe for 

826
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,060
years,
man.

827
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,250
You got to admit the dude put his time 
in.

828
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,263
Alright.
There's a lot of weeds out there that 

829
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,540
are complaining about Harry,
but these fuckers,

830
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,660
they grow real fast and then they just 
stay the same size.

831
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,673
They're not hustlers.
They don't have the long game like 

832
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:39,680
Harry.
I don't know.

833
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,880
Harry seems happy,
but could he be the.

834
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,070
I mean I would miss the sun personally.
I'd missed the sunshine.

835
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:46,600
You say that.
Okay.

836
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,700
But Harry's mostly a route.
All right?

837
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,053
Could be out there in the dirt and 
occasionally pick up a little good 

838
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,253
point.
Was sad routes that have the story of 

839
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:57,160
the two,
the rest of the root system.

840
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,590
Like they,
they're up above the rest of the roots.

841
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:00,490
Like,
what's going on up there?

842
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,620
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

843
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:04,370
I'm making a comment.
I'll make it a break for it.

844
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,060
Deer's can eat the little saplings.
Shut the fuck up.

845
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,450
Hi,
Ms Dot Harry.

846
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,510
Harry was a hustler.
Harry is the Jay Z of tree roots.

847
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,550
Do.
Did you hear how he got busted wide?

848
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,900
Yeah.
This plumber came in.

849
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,700
Oh,
you got an ambitious.

850
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:21,340
They ripped out.
I was telling him,

851
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:24,310
you gotta stay small.
You get too big.

852
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,660
You fucking salad keys day.
And that's when they come for you.

853
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,660
It's behind the music all over again.
Is that is?

854
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:34,480
That is terrible.
It is behind the music.

855
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,990
Goddammit.
You're right here.

856
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:36,824
We got too big.

857
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,580
I would.
Um,

858
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,480
he's a goddamn bad company.
Song.

859
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,603
He got playing there as when you see 
what's going on around the world and 

860
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,580
these horrible places.
Um,

861
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:56,170
my,
my daughters have friends and the sun in

862
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,004
the summer,
their parents take them to Haiti or 

863
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,454
someplace and they work for a week or 
two helping build these places and it's 

864
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,310
not.
I was like,

865
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,960
Eh,
this is just like a white,

866
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,330
you know,
I'm feeling good about myself,

867
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,610
kind of a thing,
you know what I mean?

868
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,940
And then I go back home and the 
wonderful people,

869
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,790
but they really do need the help.
Like they really honestly benefit from,

870
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,930
from people coming down and helping them
and bring supplies and stuff.

871
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Do you have any desire to do that?
Like every pygmy guy,

872
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,960
I'd have to really think that one 
through a man.

873
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,460
I think my best

874
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,410
method of helping is just talking shit.
Hear me about it.

875
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,520
Yeah,
you're good at it.

876
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,080
Yeah.
I mean donating money.

877
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,370
Yeah.
But I don't know,

878
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,070
but getting on camera and go sleeping on
A.

879
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,900
I don't know if that's the most 
effective thing for me.

880
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,880
Yeah,
maybe that's just a cop out on my part.

881
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,540
I don't know.
I feel like I should do it

882
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,780
once.
You know what,

883
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,640
I think the real issue with all these 
different places,

884
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,570
they don't like.
There's only so much access to growth in

885
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:06,990
certain places.
You know,

886
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,030
like we think of life as being growth 
oriented,

887
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,730
like especially in this country,
in this country.

888
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,670
We think of life not as like,
do you have enough to eat?

889
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,980
Do you have friends around you that you 
care about?

890
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:21,080
Are you having a good time?
We don't think about it that way.

891
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,410
We think about it as are you constantly 
moving forward?

892
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,420
Are you out of the clubs now doing the,
the,

893
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,230
the,
the no.

894
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,911
Good,
good,

895
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:29,744
good.
I heard you guys bought a new house 

896
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,553
yammering.
Dora.

897
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,490
Yeah.
You're always moving.

898
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,810
You're always moving.
You're moving up.

899
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,703
You're not always going.
Whereas that is just how we mark 

900
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,153
success.
Whereas in a lot of cultures that's not 

901
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:44,900
even a part of life.

902
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,973
There is no moving up.
Like you can get a job and you can work 

903
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,630
and you were part of this community.
Do whatever you do,

904
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:52,570
whether you're a fisherman or whether 
you're a carpenter,

905
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,080
whatever you do,
but that's it.

906
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,490
You just lived that life and so that's 
their idea of what life is now.

907
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:00,340
Our idea of life is,
you know,

908
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,790
get a nice car,
get a nice house,

909
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:06,620
got a big TV,
but what if there's something past that,

910
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,663
right?
Like what if some new thing comes along 

911
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,620
that makes this idea completely fucking 
ridiculous?

912
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:12,781
No,
no,

913
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:13,614
no.
You get enough credit so you can plug 

914
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:17,450
into the matrix and then we start 
thinking like that.

915
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:18,284
Like with this idea that the only way 
your life could ever be good if you get 

916
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:24,830
a nice new laptop or get a,
you know,

917
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,620
or you live in a nice community.
You know,

918
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,470
that seems a little weird because really
it's just life.

919
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,003
No,
I know.

920
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,400
I mean the bigger.
Yeah,

921
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:35,370
and then you get,
you accumulate more liver.

922
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,920
The problem with it is that you 
accumulate more things and then you,

923
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,173
you're still in that vulnerable feeling.
Now I got to pay for this and move 

924
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,873
forward and get like you say,
get more then then you're with your 

925
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:49,900
friend on his private jet and you're 
like,

926
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,250
oh,
well I don't have that.

927
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:53,640
I guess I have to keep working.
You know what I mean?

928
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,600
Yeah.
And then this guy has a yacht.

929
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:57,190
Oh my God.
It's got a yacht.

930
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:59,920
He's got a 59 foot yacht.
This is one big,

931
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,230
big,
like 100 hundred and 20 foot.

932
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,723
What's a good size yacht?
Connor put this up to their dad as he 

933
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,550
pulled up behind him when he was like 
hanging out wherever he is,

934
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:10,384
but that's a yacht.
I started thinking about the problems 

935
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,450
you would have if you had this shot.

936
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,300
Like you got to have a security team 
because someone's.

937
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,040
I'll show you how big it is.
So my God,

938
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:18,943
that looks like the death star.
It's got an opening on the side for a 

939
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,840
boat.
The whole boat can go inside the yacht.

940
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,020
She cited problems you have to have.
If you had this shot,

941
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,440
could be even crazier.
Oh my looking.

942
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,280
Where is this space that is maybe 
something like that.

943
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,280
Visa.
They say it.

944
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,630
They say a FIFA.
What is that?

945
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,030
That's silly.
Tell him to put a t h on that bitch.

946
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,800
Now there's A.
Yeah,

947
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,690
incredible man.
It's crazy.

948
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:47,640
Yeah,
but what's enough?

949
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:49,550
I guess is the thing,
man,

950
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,440
$360 million dollar yacht and he said,
Jesus Christ,

951
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,210
see what $360 million dollar yacht 
fucking name,

952
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,044
man.
That's when you're seeing what are we 

953
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:02,844
doing wrong that we don't see that 
sitting back with a cigar so more 

954
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,753
rutgers.
We've got to bring back record sales in 

955
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,730
a way.
We looked at the books,

956
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,073
live concerts just can't do it.
It's just not enough money to charge 

957
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,833
tickets.
I need $390 million to get a slightly 

958
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:24,261
larger with a diamond encrusted anchor 
and a crew that will

959
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,150
lower it and wipe it off where I pull 
the water off when we pull it out of the

960
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:33,780
water crew of hot white chicks with big 
asses.

961
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,560
It's only buddy who works there.
They don't hire any third world help.

962
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,013
Hot White chicks.

963
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,913
Do you think it's a sickness that we 
have to keep racing or do you feel like 

964
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:44,034
it's healthy?
I feel like it keeps you making stuff 

965
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:47,940
and keeps you,
you know,

966
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:49,320
creating and doing things.

967
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,890
It can.
It can be either or.

968
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:51,780
Right.
I mean,

969
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,623
it can be a good thing because people 
aren't ambitious and don't get things 

970
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:56,854
done.
A lot of times we all know like lazy 

971
00:45:58,991 --> 00:45:59,824
guys and their sometimes their family 
can suffer because they don't make ends 

972
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:04,834
meet and it's not because of a lack of 
opportunity because they fuck up and 

973
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:10,510
they're lazy and they don't just gear 
with it and get together,

974
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,303
but at a certain point in time we'd be 
definitely know people that are caught 

975
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:18,010
up in it to the point where that's all 
they're concerned with,

976
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,240
they're concerned with is moving up and 
the numbers and the ladder and the.

977
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,770
Yeah,
that's not good either.

978
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,890
So either one,
it's like you've defined this band,

979
00:46:26,891 --> 00:46:31,360
comfortable balance as a human being and
don't get swept away by your pursuit.

980
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,790
Pursuit is just something that you're 
engaging in.

981
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,400
But yeah,
this is why like I like to look at.

982
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,650
This is a fucking very hippy way to look
at things,

983
00:46:38,651 --> 00:46:41,590
but I honestly like to look at all my 
pursuits,

984
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:42,424
like everything I do or I try to do as 
something that hopefully makes me a 

985
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:49,140
better person is contradictory,
is a.

986
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,033
They are in some ways like Jujitsu,
a lot of people would think would be 

987
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:54,160
contradictory to making you a better 
person.

988
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:54,611
No,
you just have.

989
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,060
They're strangling people.
Show me the show.

990
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,300
It seems kind of mean Joe row.
That's not really what you're doing when

991
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:01,134
you're doing is you're testing yourself 
in these extreme situations with other 

992
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:05,830
likeminded people and he developed a 
lot.

993
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,960
First of all,
you develop a keen understanding of your

994
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,150
actual vulnerability,
you know,

995
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,350
because I've been choked out by people 
that are outweighed by like 30 pounds,

996
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:15,740
40 pounds,
strangling.

997
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,960
Yeah,
for sure man.

998
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:19,120
Yeah.
It happens all the time and I'm decent,

999
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:19,930
right?
Yeah.

1000
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,180
And I get my ass kicked.
People way smarter than me.

1001
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,460
It's humbling and people bigger than me 
that are better than me.

1002
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:25,294
They just run right through me like I 
don't exist and I've been doing it a 

1003
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:30,110
long time.
So like

1004
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,460
the average person that has this 
delusional perspective of who they are,

1005
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,773
you have to face and he also got to get 
used to getting tapped out and getting 

1006
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,194
used to getting tapped out.
Like it's humbling and it doesn't feel 

1007
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:41,794
good.
And then you have to be able to just 

1008
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:44,800
accept it.
It's just a learning thing,

1009
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,510
like don't get your ego attached to 
this.

1010
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,673
The reason why you got tapped out is 
your arm is supposed to be here and you 

1011
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:52,270
reached here and you got caught.
So don't do that anymore.

1012
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,700
Now you know should thank that person 
for,

1013
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,140
for taking advantage of whatever 
possibilities you leave.

1014
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,393
Because when you leave these openings,
now you need to know those openings are 

1015
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,250
there because you didn't know it was 
there before.

1016
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,310
Next time you won't do this with your 
arm.

1017
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,500
You'll keep your arm right here like 
you're supposed to do that and you might

1018
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,750
still get tapped out,
but it'll be harder.

1019
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,500
Isn't it amazing?
Like any,

1020
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,570
anytime you talk about whether it makes 
you a good person,

1021
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,003
any kind of a thing like that,
like what you're talking about is kind 

1022
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,354
of similar to yoga.
It's kind of similar to what you're 

1023
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:23,980
talking about,
like going and helping the pygmy.

1024
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:24,973
It's all about the common denominator 
with all of it is getting your ego out 

1025
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,480
of it,
getting your ego out of the way.

1026
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,250
And it's a thing is looking at like 
really taking some objective time.

1027
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,320
Yeah.
A lot of people just keep going.

1028
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,620
They don't ever stop and assess 
themselves.

1029
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,920
How could I have done that better?
How could I have handled this better?

1030
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,390
Yeah,
it's,

1031
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,710
there's a,
there's a real.

1032
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,250
It's like if you can get rid of the,
the,

1033
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,630
uh,
the,

1034
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:53,703
the ego and the self and all of us and 
realize you're a part of something 

1035
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,070
larger.

1036
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,060
Like even in Jujitsu,
like the way you're describing it,

1037
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,600
it's that you're interacting with other 
human beings.

1038
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,990
It's not like you just isolated walking 
around thinking I'm great.

1039
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,883
It's only when you get there with other 
people that you're kind of learning and 

1040
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,230
having that back and forth.
And I think,

1041
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:13,270
um,
I honestly think yoga is real similar in

1042
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:14,104
that way to yoga is very humbling when 
you do it together with a group of 

1043
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:20,170
people and everyone's struggling,
oh,

1044
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,900
and there's this brutal and that you're,
you're,

1045
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:27,390
you're on the mat next to two tiny girls
who are just doing things that you can't

1046
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:29,590
do.
And you're just like,

1047
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,880
that's,
it's humbling.

1048
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,500
It's humbling.
Super humbling.

1049
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,560
There's a lady that works out in my yoga
class sometimes she's like in her,

1050
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,533
maybe

1051
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,780
she might be 60 and she's definitely in 
her late fifties and she's jacked dude.

1052
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:46,470
She's Jackie.
She does handstands and shit.

1053
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,140
It's like it's so inspirational.
Amazing.

1054
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:49,974
Watching this lady take a yoga class.
I mean she does crossfit and she's just 

1055
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,900
fucking completely shredded six pack 
shoulders,

1056
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:58,763
just obviously fantastic genetics,
but also never stopped working out or 

1057
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,530
whole life.
Always moving,

1058
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,753
always doing it.
Jesus like it to be next to this lady 

1059
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,830
was also of course ultra flexible in a 
class.

1060
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,420
Watch her do all this.
She was like,

1061
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:13,254
Holy Shit,
you're arms are shaking like a little 

1062
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:18,930
baby giraffe for her.
It's humbling though.

1063
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,760
That's my point is that like it's 
fucking hard.

1064
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,713
Yeah.
When you do hard shit and I don't think 

1065
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:25,830
enough of us do hard shit.
Puts things in perspective.

1066
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,800
Your mind wants to gravitate towards 
softness and the couch and the easy road

1067
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,080
and naps and Ah,
fuck that.

1068
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,913
Let's quit.
Yeah,

1069
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,230
your mind gravitates towards that easy.
Oh,

1070
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,710
100 percent.
Just like,

1071
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,733
oh,
someone's gave me a someone's and you 

1072
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:46,430
know why people wallow in shit because 
it's warm and comfortable.

1073
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,270
They're great.
It is great.

1074
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,560
It was great.
It is great.

1075
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,550
It is.
It's like,

1076
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,510
oh,
it's just like this,

1077
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,613
but you know,
there's that thing like we're talking 

1078
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:57,801
about,
you know,

1079
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:58,634
being,
living in these communities and other 

1080
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:01,040
countries and you just,
you're a fisherman,

1081
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:01,874
you do your little thing.
Is that wallowing and shit and just 

1082
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:05,324
things small or is there a beauty and a 
great life living in something small 

1083
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:10,724
like that.
There's beauty and a great life and 

1084
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:12,944
doing things that make you happy.
There's a lot of people that believe 

1085
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:19,430
that subsistence living,
like those folks that live off the land,

1086
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,293
like in villages and they catch fish and
they have like a whole setup and then 

1087
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,333
not without food they have food,
but the life essentially is about 

1088
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,640
procuring food.

1089
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,700
It's not about getting a job at a 
factory somewhere.

1090
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,210
Right?
Right.

1091
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,720
And then the factory will come along and
then all of a sudden the factory says,

1092
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:36,980
Hey,
we'll pay you $2 a day.

1093
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:37,551
Like,
Holy Shit,

1094
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:40,400
I've never seen $2 in my life,
and you started working for this factory

1095
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,413
and now you're eating terrible food.
You're not having it hanging out in the 

1096
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:45,110
village.
You're working all day.

1097
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,233
You're making whatever fucking brand of 
sneakers that they sell in America 

1098
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:49,484
because they can make them down there 
and pay a guy $2 a day or whatever the 

1099
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,290
rate is.
I'm obviously exaggerating,

1100
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,393
but I don't think I'm exaggerating,
but much like two bucks an hour maybe 

1101
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,520
$16 day.
Whoa.

1102
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,120
You fucking really taking care of your 
guys,

1103
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,850
right?
We're good ma'am.

1104
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,930
Ship Shit down there to have it taken 
care of and that these people without us

1105
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,070
would be broke.

1106
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,881
What?
Well,

1107
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:12,020
okay.
Maybe they would.

1108
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:16,910
Or maybe they live in a rich eco 
environment right now.

1109
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:17,803
Rich,
maybe they live in like a nice simple 

1110
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,700
will.
Healthy world.

1111
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,343
Maybe they live in a.
You ever seen that fucking were to 

1112
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,890
Herzog?
Documentary.

1113
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:32,891
Happy People know it's called happy 
people or something in the taiga life in

1114
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:35,444
the taiga.
It's about the Tiger River and Siberia 

1115
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,610
and these people that live up there and 
they have almost no money.

1116
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,430
Everything,
whatever money that they do have,

1117
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,130
like if they trap furs and stuff like 
that,

1118
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,053
they'll trade it in for like equipment 
and some money to get supplies and they 

1119
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:52,214
live off the land.
Everything is living off the land and 

1120
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:56,360
they're like the fucking happiest people
in the world.

1121
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:58,400
Really.
It's weird man.

1122
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,473
It's a super weird documentary and it 
really makes you confront like what is 

1123
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:03,260
life about?
Yeah.

1124
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:05,240
And then also the way these two 
questions,

1125
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:06,074
right?

1126
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:11,110
Like are they happy because we evolved 
that way and that those motions of going

1127
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:16,490
out and catching fish and hunting and 
growing your own vegetables and having a

1128
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,324
tight knit small community is the 
benefit in that is that it hits all the 

1129
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:24,860
old notes that we've had since we 
evolved,

1130
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,713
you know,
from the time we were lower primates to 

1131
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,104
living in these small clusters of monkey
people living in villages to working 

1132
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:36,660
together and living off the land and 
then that has been going on for so long.

1133
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,040
Yeah.
Your DNA knows it.

1134
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,380
Yeah.
This most recent trend of moving towards

1135
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,214
some sort of a technological world is so
uncomfortable for us and is working in 

1136
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:46,470
cubicles with fluorescent lighting is so
new.

1137
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,490
Yeah,
no,

1138
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:48,324
it's.
It's.

1139
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,300
It's unhealthy.
It.

1140
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,363
My sister runs this little nonprofit in 
New Jersey called city green and she 

1141
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:58,410
takes these cities like passaic and 
Patterson,

1142
00:53:58,411 --> 00:53:59,244
these places that were booming and now 
they've kind of fallen off and she 

1143
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:04,104
creates these city gardens in all of 
these different places and bring young 

1144
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:12,450
students in to sit and work with the 
earth and grow vegetables.

1145
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:17,990
The change in these kids who are just on
their phones and just in this tough city

1146
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,190
world and there's no money and it's like
this desperate.

1147
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,680
You don't know.
There's no sense of place.

1148
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,990
There's no sense of what you're supposed
to do.

1149
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:30,650
They sit in garden and actually smell 
the dirt and harvest vegetables and cook

1150
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:31,554
that food.
It changes their life because just what 

1151
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:36,840
you're saying,
it's what we're supposed to do.

1152
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,730
It's our nature as beasts.

1153
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,263
What we're supposed to do.
As much as I'm saying it's what we did 

1154
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:47,840
do for so long that we know it and the 
groups have already been cut almost like

1155
00:54:47,841 --> 00:54:48,674
what we're doing now is like you ever 
tried to take a screwdriver and a 

1156
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,193
screwdriver doesn't quite fit the screw,
but you can kind of make it work and 

1157
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,083
when you kind of make it work,
it kind of chews up the screw a little 

1158
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,330
bit because every time I use a 
screwdriver,

1159
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:07,160
that's a human being in a city,
right slot right in.

1160
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,070
Now think a human being that's living in
the taiga.

1161
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,913
You're talking about groups that had 
been polished and cut an exact fit for 

1162
00:55:14,121 --> 00:55:15,530
the environment.
Boom.

1163
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,510
So all their human reward systems for 
survival are.

1164
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,473
They're not based on some sort of 
technological innovation that will move 

1165
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:24,254
us towards a world of artificial 
intelligence and fucking the Internet 

1166
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,430
going through your brain pumping through
the sky and Wifi all over the world.

1167
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,400
Not that their grooves or carved 
differently than ours.

1168
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,940
Right?
So are good.

1169
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,170
So don't you think your groove,
like when you go out into the woods,

1170
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,700
don't you feel

1171
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,740
terrified shouldn't be there?
What am I doing?

1172
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,933
But when you come,
so when you come home and you survived 

1173
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,220
you,
your soul,

1174
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,960
something's happened to your soul.
Yeah.

1175
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,560
I appreciate civilization.
See,

1176
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:54,500
it's not.
It's not an either or is my point.

1177
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:55,334
It's not like,
well,

1178
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,350
you got to live in the woods.
That's the only way,

1179
00:55:57,351 --> 00:55:58,580
man.
You got to be one with nature.

1180
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:59,301
Okay.
Well,

1181
00:55:59,301 --> 00:56:01,460
you also should go to a nice restaurant 
in a city.

1182
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,010
You'll see a comedy show.
I mean,

1183
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:07,040
the very thing that we enjoy most 
watching and performing,

1184
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,980
standup comedy is all done with electric
lights.

1185
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,370
Shure microphone in a completely 
unnatural environment.

1186
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,540
That's air conditioned.

1187
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,350
Yeah,
but you're dealing with human beings.

1188
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,390
You're dealing with heartbeats and 
sweat.

1189
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,593
Sure breath,
but you need all this technology and 

1190
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:24,190
this is a totally new thing,
but it's most important thing to us,

1191
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,200
right?
This is a new endeavor for humans.

1192
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,034
Yeah,
but don't you feel like if you're 

1193
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:31,000
totally disconnected from nature and you
just live in that city,

1194
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:32,830
I know people that don't leave 
Manhattan,

1195
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,810
that's not good.
They're not healthy people.

1196
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,640
Yeah.
That's not good.

1197
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,450
No,
they're.

1198
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,730
They're like shaky and weird.
Next to the battery all the time.

1199
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,740
That is not good.
The biggest Condo,

1200
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,010
I'm telling you.
One walk,

1201
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,873
one hike,
and it was we would fix their head or 

1202
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,530
you can see the.
Here's the thing.

1203
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:54,364
I think you can be completely healthy.
Being some fucking business person 

1204
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,220
that's out there kicking ass and taking 
names.

1205
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:03,280
I don't think it's impossible.
Not Possible.

1206
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,503
I think every time for me to say that 
someone can't do it and be like as 

1207
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,120
fulfilled and happy as these people in 
the Werner Herzog documentary.

1208
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:13,450
Huh?
It's ridiculous.

1209
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,410
Like what?
What do I know?

1210
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,800
People are so different.
They vary so much and I know people that

1211
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,870
are fucking miserable when you take them
in the woods,

1212
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,083
all this.
Especially people who don't exercise at 

1213
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,773
all.
Have you ever seen him about a guy that 

1214
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,550
doesn't exercise at all?
Trying to make it up a big steep hill?

1215
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:33,220
It is.
Oh yeah.

1216
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,920
It's hilarious.
Feet started hurting.

1217
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:36,754
Her ankles pop like they're basically 
like sticks around and buy bags of 

1218
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:41,194
Jello.
It really gets going and then they have 

1219
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:44,650
to move their body up a hill.
Fuck.

1220
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,813
We had a.
We live on a hill and they were paving 

1221
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:50,830
it the other day and my office looks out
over the,

1222
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,980
over the street,
you know,

1223
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,460
and I watched people walk their dogs or 
run,

1224
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,090
that's why I texted you about hills,
which we can talk about later.

1225
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,610
And uh,
I,

1226
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,933
so they're paving the streets so 
everyone had to park down at the bottom 

1227
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:07,300
of the street so everyone had to walk to
their cars and I never saw these people.

1228
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,133
They were coming out like,
which is like stick people walking and 

1229
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:14,320
then having to go back up the hill.
Miserable.

1230
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,603
They don't walk,
they never walk in and they're like 

1231
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,570
trying to like get up a thing,
like a,

1232
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,280
like a broken down robot.
Yeah.

1233
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:23,114
It's,
I mean some people were injured for 

1234
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,504
sure,
but some people they just stopped using 

1235
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,190
it and it started deteriorating.
And you know,

1236
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:32,410
you tribute that to getting older,
which is absolutely a factor,

1237
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:35,470
but it's more of a factor when you don't
exercise.

1238
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,300
And it sounds like some Goddamn 
infomercial.

1239
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:38,700
I know I do,
but I'm,

1240
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,773
I'm being honest like everybody,
I'm not talking about do the shit that 

1241
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:43,663
you know you do.
You or anybody that's like fucking 

1242
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:49,360
crossfit and like that lady in my yoga 
class who looks like a Greek statue.

1243
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,250
No,
you don't have to go completely nuts,

1244
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,120
but you got to move.

1245
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,060
You got to do something for your body.
Got To do.

1246
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,590
Just go walk man.
Walk up hills if you can.

1247
00:58:56,591 --> 00:59:00,610
If you live in a place that has hills,
it's fucking giant for you and don't for

1248
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,503
Chrysler.
Don't think you're really running when 

1249
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,480
you're running on a treadmill.
Motherfucker.

1250
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,040
I was running yesterday.
I was thinking about that because I just

1251
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,800
listened to it.
He runs Cleveland,

1252
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,663
but just giving them our time,
telling me he was running like seven 

1253
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:14,980
minute miles.
My bitch.

1254
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:15,814
You weren't going anywhere.
You're in the same room and that is a 

1255
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:19,230
crazy thing to say.
Yeah,

1256
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,200
exactly.
And getting off and writing seven minute

1257
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:27,480
miles on a fucking treadmill.
You're in the same room.

1258
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,590
I want to hear any of this mild talk.
This is crazy.

1259
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,730
And get outside with the sun in your 
face and the wind blowing on you fucking

1260
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:35,330
elliptical.

1261
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,450
Told me the other day.
I went five miles.

1262
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:38,303
I'm like,
how did I go five miles isn't even a 

1263
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:40,814
method of transportation if,
if I got off this thing walking around 

1264
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:49,280
this way,
at least when you're on a treadmill,

1265
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:50,960
you're mimicking running.
Yeah,

1266
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:51,794
exactly.
You're kind of running the with the 

1267
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:56,270
thing you are,
but it's like 60 percent,

1268
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,830
maybe 70,
70 percent running.

1269
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:58,940
Yeah,
running is.

1270
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:02,450
It's better than nothing.
Elliptical is what is that?

1271
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:03,620
Yeah.
You're pulling.

1272
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,840
I'm pulling out my going miles by 
pulling.

1273
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,400
I didn't understand what you were saying
about when you texted me that you do the

1274
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,440
hills for an hour.
What does that mean though?

1275
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:14,870
I mean an hour and that's how long the 
run takes.

1276
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,300
Takes it outside for an hour.
But you go,

1277
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,340
what time I start.
This is my.

1278
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,373
I tried,
I've gone further and shorter and I'll 

1279
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:25,970
still go shorter if I'm short on time 
because the end part of my run that I've

1280
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:26,804
been doing pretty regularly is the last 
part is a mile and seven tenths of that 

1281
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,870
is straight up and it's fucking rough.

1282
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,970
Yeah,
I can.

1283
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:41,390
If I could get up it away with a really 
slow,

1284
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:42,224
steady pace,
but I'm way to meet head for that so I 

1285
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,150
do mad sprints until I can't do this 
anymore.

1286
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:50,630
And then I paused and I try to get that 
pause down to a minute,

1287
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,590
pause down to a minute where my 
heartbeat gets to below 1:40

1288
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:55,424
beats a second and then I charge,
so I have spots where I know that I can 

1289
01:00:58,671 --> 01:00:59,504
reach.
Then I try to go to 20 yards past that 

1290
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:02,984
spot to go 20 yards,
but the ultimate goal is I'll never 

1291
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:07,574
really make it.
The ultimate goal is to be able to 

1292
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:11,090
sprint all the way up the hill.
Gotcha.

1293
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,160
To sprint all.
I have this killer hill,

1294
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,800
not the one I was just talking about 
going up the other way.

1295
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,700
It's a killer hill paved,
but it's killer and uh,

1296
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,120
I was thinking I should do because I'll 
go run three miles,

1297
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,800
but um,
you know,

1298
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:25,663
it's a little hilly,
but,

1299
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,840
but I was thinking like if I were to 
just spend the workout going up and down

1300
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:31,340
that hill,
it's amazing,

1301
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,080
but like,
I don't know what would be,

1302
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:35,923
what would constitute too much 
comparable or more than the three miles 

1303
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:41,030
that I'm running.

1304
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,740
It'll be way harder.
It'll be harder,

1305
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:43,574
but would do it three times or I would 
say do it once and see how you feel and 

1306
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:50,510
maybe don't even do it that hard.
You know,

1307
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:51,344
that I've heard that advice.
I'm a fucking terrible listener to my 

1308
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:55,694
own advice because I always do too much 
and then get real sore and then I 

1309
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:58,791
realize,
okay,

1310
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:00,830
I got to back this off and build up to 
it.

1311
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,990
That that was a big thing with me with 
the running.

1312
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,243
I'm like,
I tried to go way hard on it real quick 

1313
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:09,320
and also tried to go way hard on with 
those five finger shoes.

1314
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,570
I'm going to be super careful with those
things.

1315
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:13,640
Yeah,
there's great benefit in those things,

1316
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:17,180
but you think they lost the class action
lawsuit,

1317
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:20,190
and I should clear this up for a lot of 
people that have been texting

1318
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,023
me about this or I'm messaging me or 
commenting on my instagram posts about 

1319
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,650
those things I learned.
First of all,

1320
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,990
I don't.
I'm not paid by these people.

1321
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,750
They don't support me in any way.
There's no.

1322
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:34,560
They never spent a dime on advertising 
or penny advertising this podcast.

1323
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,080
This is vibram vibram five fivefingers 
shoes.

1324
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,730
I learned about them from and I learned 
about them before monkey.

1325
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,720
But mark,
yeah,

1326
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,190
those five finger toasters.
But Mark Sisson,

1327
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:46,920
who is this,
he's a very well respected,

1328
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,590
um,
endurance athlete.

1329
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,100
He was coach and now he does.
Um,

1330
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:52,423
he brought this book,
the primal blueprint about like healthy 

1331
01:02:55,621 --> 01:03:00,480
diets and he goes back and forth from 
Quito or to like a real,

1332
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,520
real low sugar,
low carb,

1333
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,730
very fat adapted,
really very smart and very,

1334
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,350
very well educated.
What's his name again?

1335
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,530
Mark Sisson says,
and he was talking about these things,

1336
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:11,340
but that's the only things you.

1337
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,230
Whereas most times he's barefoot and 
he's essentially.

1338
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,173
Yeah,
he's essentially saying that your feet 

1339
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:17,203
are in shoes.
It's like your feet being in a cast and 

1340
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:20,034
all those muscles in your feet sort of 
atrophy and then when you put on those 

1341
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,800
five finger shoes,
those muscles have to work in a way that

1342
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:27,990
really don't have to work when they're 
in a shoe.

1343
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,913
It's much harder for them.
So the same exercise that you would do 

1344
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:36,420
the same run is way harder because your 
feet are getting away.

1345
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:37,254
Harder workout,
but you have to be careful because if 

1346
01:03:39,151 --> 01:03:42,400
you go too hard,
a lot of people get plantar fasciitis,

1347
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,363
which is a really bad like pain.
Pain in the bottom of their foot with 

1348
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:50,903
the Fascia is all fucked up and it's 
tearing and the bottom of your foot is 

1349
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,700
in severe agony.
I know several people that have got it,

1350
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,003
got it.

1351
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,680
From wearing those five finger or toe 
shoes on a treadmill,

1352
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:05,490
kneel daily and he's light.
He's not even pushing mass.

1353
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,070
He is,
but neil is a bit of an obsessive person

1354
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,313
like in a good way and I think that 
maybe he got obsessed with running and 

1355
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:14,050
maybe ran a little too hard.
Shoes.

1356
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,860
You've got to be super careful though.
She was milled up slow,

1357
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:17,963
but once you do build up you can.
You could run in those things and like 

1358
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:24,750
my feet feel so different than they felt
like five months ago.

1359
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,441
Really?
Yeah,

1360
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:27,360
they're way different.
The way stronger.

1361
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:30,240
Way Stronger.
Do you need strong feet?

1362
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,160
Well,
here's where it's good.

1363
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,340
When are you doing with these feet?
Just walking around.

1364
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:36,510
It's easier.
Yeah.

1365
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,433
My ankles are stronger.
My feet because I'm running all this 

1366
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:39,834
weird fucked up terrain.
Libyans when you get up at night to go 

1367
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:44,760
to the bathroom where you wake up in the
morning,

1368
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:49,050
I gotta get up and my ankles are like 
waking up kind of a thing.

1369
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,420
Do you still have that?
No,

1370
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:51,700
I don't have any of that.
You don't have any of that?

1371
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,670
Did you before you ran in these shoes?
No,

1372
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:55,530
not really.
I've never really had much ankle pain.

1373
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:58,620
If a temporary just like creaky.
No.

1374
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,870
Like beer cans,
ankle now for whatever reason,

1375
01:05:00,871 --> 01:05:04,320
I never had that.
I did so much of my youth kicking.

1376
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,600
Things like my ankles are pretty strong.
Right?

1377
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:07,493
Because there's so much.
Because when you're throwing kicks like 

1378
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:12,630
you think about especially like a side 
kick or a front kick,

1379
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:15,990
there is so much pressure on the ankle.
You're.

1380
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:18,880
Yeah,
you're using them not so much with round

1381
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:19,750
kicks,
round kicks.

1382
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:21,700
Kind of pull it apart.
You hit with the Shin,

1383
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,190
but when you're hitting with the actual 
foot itself,

1384
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,293
there's a lot of stress on the ankle and
I think my ankles develop really strong 

1385
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:29,134
because of that.

1386
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,063
So when I run I feel a big difference in
the workout when I run up a straight 

1387
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:39,481
hill versus a run up like a trail with 
rocks and shit where I have to jump from

1388
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:43,960
one step stone to another and I'm 
navigating your way with me.

1389
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,640
Come,
come do it with me one time.

1390
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,391
I'll do it.
Yeah.

1391
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:47,224
Don't do it with the five finger shoes.
Doing regular shoes and I still 

1392
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,820
alternate when I need a really hard 
workout.

1393
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,660
I alternate like and then I put these on
is this is what I like the best.

1394
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,630
He's Solomon trail shoes.
Oh yeah.

1395
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,391
Yeah.
You know why?

1396
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:03,190
Because this,
this tread here is the shit shreds slide

1397
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:03,550
out.
Oh,

1398
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,630
not at all.
It's like a,

1399
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,740
like a dirt bike tire or something.
It just grips in the dirt.

1400
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,100
It's like the best traction.
How far?

1401
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,430
How far?
Like A,

1402
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,530
like a flat run.

1403
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,170
Do you go?
I don't ever flat rate.

1404
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:17,004
Don't ever fly.
Me and I run are always going up in 

1405
01:06:18,031 --> 01:06:19,470
these trips.
These little.

1406
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,280
Yeah,
because it's exciting.

1407
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:25,090
It's so much more fun when you're in a 
trail post to go back to nature.

1408
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:25,924
By the way,
you can get excited when you're out 

1409
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,133
there.
I see a person occasionally walking 

1410
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:30,100
their dog,
hanging out,

1411
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,560
walking the trails and shit.
Now that's great,

1412
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:33,394
but it's mostly just me running these 
hard ass hills is nothing more fun when 

1413
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:37,744
you're sprinting.
When that was a kid we walked to school 

1414
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:42,130
through the woods.
Oh Man.

1415
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,710
It was just when you would take off and 
you're jumping from rock to rock,

1416
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:45,544
you know,
especially when you know the trail and 

1417
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:48,840
you know where are.
You've got to jump in slide.

1418
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,780
Yeah,
you're playing.

1419
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,310
Yeah,
that's exactly it.

1420
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:52,450
You're planning now.
When I run to it,

1421
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:53,050
you don't want to do that.

1422
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:58,050
When I ran for real,
when first you can have a four year run,

1423
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,143
that's then I'd be.
Then I'd start thinking I'm having a 

1424
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,840
heart attack.
A heart attack.

1425
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:07,600
Your heart is working hard to bring it 
in.

1426
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,341
Go for them.
Yeah,

1427
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:10,630
man.
First of all,

1428
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,560
there's been proof that a lot of 
endurance athletes find great benefit in

1429
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:15,550
marijuana.
What?

1430
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:16,960
Even smoking?
Vaping.

1431
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:18,820
It in particular.
Some of them edibles.

1432
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:21,220
Yeah.
They feel like it dilates your lungs.

1433
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,180
Make sure lungs take in more oxygen,
rear.

1434
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,870
It also makes you more in tune with your
body.

1435
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,210
A lot of weight lifter smoke weed before
they lift weights.

1436
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,270
Really lot of weightlifters more and 
more now than ever before.

1437
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:33,790
I get messages from people all the time 
that say,

1438
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:34,200
dude,
I,

1439
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,500
you know,
I thought it was a loser.

1440
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:36,334
Like people say,
I was a loser for smoking pot before I 

1441
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:39,550
worked out,
but at some of my best workouts ever,

1442
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:41,530
I'm not talking about gets so blitzed 
where you like,

1443
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,610
you look at the curl,
like,

1444
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:44,080
how do I know how to move my arm like 
this?

1445
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,890
I feel weird.
Get just a little high.

1446
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:48,873
We just a hill.
Your muscles like yoga to like Terence 

1447
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,840
Mckenna actually believed that yoga was 
a guide to how to use Hash.

1448
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,880
He felt like has sheesh and um,
and marijuana,

1449
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,190
you know how she says made from 
marijuana?

1450
01:08:06,191 --> 01:08:07,660
Yeah.
That's.

1451
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,220
Yeah.
Hashish is awesome.

1452
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,433
And people.
But your sash sounds like you're doing 

1453
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:13,000
heroin,
like to dine,

1454
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,980
educated uninitiated.
It's just super strong

1455
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,813
DHC,
right?

1456
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,050
Yeah.
But the,

1457
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:19,580
uh,
the,

1458
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:23,390
the feeling that they would get from it 
is from Yoga,

1459
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,940
doing it that way is what inspired those
moves.

1460
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,380
And he believes that yoga started with 
people that were smoking hash.

1461
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,300
He believes that that's where it 
originated from.

1462
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:34,340
Like when you're high and you start 
stretching,

1463
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,203
it feels really good.
And these people are known torris users 

1464
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:41,220
of cannabis and how she and a lot of 
smoke,

1465
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,160
like he was saying,
the dirty secret amongst dues.

1466
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,223
Is that really what they're concentrated
on is how many chillums can you smoke 

1467
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,860
and still be there.
Like they,

1468
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:53,870
they'll like take pride in chillum is 
like a head of Hash.

1469
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,781
Oh,
that's a call.

1470
01:08:54,781 --> 01:08:58,670
The chillum yeah.
What is the exact definition of Chelan?

1471
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,820
Because the only people I've ever heard 
is hash people talk about it and I don't

1472
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:05,030
see him chill them find that because I'm
not A.

1473
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,110
I've only smoked hash couple of times.
Not like a prolific hash user,

1474
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,620
but in other countries there's serious 
ha.

1475
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,653
It's weird because like people get 
busted and they get treated when they 

1476
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:17,234
get busted with Hash.
Like they're smuggling meth or 

1477
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:19,630
something.
So yeah,

1478
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:22,160
it sounds more intense.
It sounds like a different thing.

1479
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,080
It's not a dangerous thing.
This is the point.

1480
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,040
It's not at all.
No,

1481
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,243
but it gets classified in those ways.
Like people think of Hash as like 

1482
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,733
something from.
Wasn't that what they got arrested for 

1483
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:33,780
in the midnight express?
That's right.

1484
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,693
That's right,
yeah.

1485
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,613
We'd,
yeah,

1486
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,530
right,
exactly.

1487
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,120
Turkish prison for weed.
Yeah.

1488
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:40,940
Here's this dude going to chill him.
Oh boy.

1489
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,190
Yeah.
So that guy,

1490
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:45,170
that guy,
that guy gets high as fuck.

1491
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:46,004
These guys are so high.
They're painting themselves up like 

1492
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:50,580
superheroes and shit.
He's all dreadlocked.

1493
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:51,080
He's his face.

1494
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:51,913
Looks like a ghost.
So these are sod dudes that are smoking 

1495
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:54,880
chillums.
Crazy beard.

1496
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:59,881
Do you see the Hash there in his pipe?
So Saad dues just get barbecued barbecue

1497
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:07,040
high and they do yoga and I noticed it.
What it is.

1498
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,650
Yeah,
when I,

1499
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,533
I,
this was before I was like doing yoga 

1500
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,294
regularly,
but I had to do this show and I was 

1501
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:13,964
particularly nervous because someone I 
really didn't like was in the audience 

1502
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,700
and really did.
I'm like Yay.

1503
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:20,543
I really didn't like was in the audience
and some people that were there to see 

1504
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:25,700
me with were in the audience.
So it was your night?

1505
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,910
Yeah,
it was weird.

1506
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,093
Right?
So what I did was I smoked weed and I 

1507
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,653
got really stretchy and I started 
stretching out and in my stretching in 

1508
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:40,280
like this,
like severe stretching is going to sound

1509
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,260
super fucking Hippie,
but I,

1510
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,303
I felt a severe sense of forgiveness for
this person that I don't like and I 

1511
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,340
still don't like him to this day.
Yeah.

1512
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,550
I do avoid him at all costs.
It's not a,

1513
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:57,780
it's not a healthy human,
but I felt a severe sense of forgiveness

1514
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:04,790
and acceptance and almost like,
like pity.

1515
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:05,700
Yeah,
no,

1516
01:11:05,701 --> 01:11:06,770
that's no,
that's real.

1517
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:09,410
That's not a hand.
Love to have this weird love thing.

1518
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,850
I feel bad for the guy.
Like I'm almost like I don't want him in

1519
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,170
my life because I don't want to manage 
it.

1520
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,153
Right.

1521
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:16,800
I know what you mean.
But there's yoga does.

1522
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:17,663
When you go into Yoga,
you can be stressed and balled up and 

1523
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:24,630
you can have like a work thing rattling 
in your head that's just.

1524
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,540
And you could be pissed at somebody when
you come out,

1525
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,583
it doesn't matter.
And is the thing that seems 

1526
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:34,380
counterintuitive.
Like why would stretching make your mind

1527
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:35,580
feel better?
Like what is going on?

1528
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:37,440
And there's.
So there's all this rationalization,

1529
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:38,490
right?
Is it,

1530
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:40,860
um,
endorphins that are being released?

1531
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:41,993
Is it the,
is it just the fact that your body 

1532
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:46,170
needed to exercise?
But that's,

1533
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,820
that's this sort of weird sort of,
um,

1534
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,960
need to dissect things and figure out 
the one cause yeah,

1535
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:55,794
the one reason,
a minimalist approach or minimalizing 

1536
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,283
yeah,
you want to,

1537
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,380
you want to understand it,
you want to get your head around it.

1538
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,310
It's all those things.

1539
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,040
It's the physical thing.
It's probably the endorphins.

1540
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,610
It's the physical release of the muscles
which relaxes your body,

1541
01:12:08,611 --> 01:12:10,880
which relaxes your mind because 
everything's connected.

1542
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:11,913
And it's also the act of stretching this
intense act of stretching and holding 

1543
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:16,824
positions.
It does something for the overall way 

1544
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:22,380
that your mind interacts with your body 
completely.

1545
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,333
The time body affects the way your mind,
where time becomes different in a class 

1546
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:28,920
like that.
It goes by super quick and slow.

1547
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:31,530
My 90 minute class,
my yoga teacher said,

1548
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:32,910
uh,
she said,

1549
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:34,950
uh,
at the end of class she said,

1550
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:39,951
it's yoga is like aspirin.
You may not exactly know why it works,

1551
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,710
but you know,
it works and it's the yoga.

1552
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,980
You don't know what exactly just 
happened during this hour,

1553
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,640
but I feel much more at peace when I 
walk out of there.

1554
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:51,990
Then I did coming in.
Yeah,

1555
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:53,170
man,
a hundred percent.

1556
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,360
That's a good way to look at it.

1557
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,190
Yeah,
it just works.

1558
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,710
So if,
uh,

1559
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,180
they talk crazy.
Shouldn't yoga though?

1560
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,640
No,
this is massaging your descending colon.

1561
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,733
No,
it's not.

1562
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,720
You can only use 70 percent of your 
brain.

1563
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:07,710
No,
that's not true.

1564
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,200
That's been disproven.
Yeah.

1565
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:11,340
No,
I,

1566
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:12,174
it took me a long time to find a yoga 
teacher that wasn't taking me down the 

1567
01:13:15,281 --> 01:13:16,460
uh,
the,

1568
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,990
in the weird spots and talking all that 
stuff.

1569
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,540
She's just.
So let's just do this.

1570
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,120
Here's the Po's correct your arm.
Correct.

1571
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:27,360
That she doesn't get hippy dippy one ohm
and you're in.

1572
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,600
It's just awesome enough as it is and 
it's on all of them that do this.

1573
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:31,720
You know,
the place I go to,

1574
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,570
the trigger runs it.
She never does it.

1575
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,573
She doesn't say crazy shit,
but she's inspirational and there's a 

1576
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:38,880
lot of people in there that are 
inspirational and all,

1577
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,320
all their weird styles.

1578
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,363
Like this one dude that teaches my class
college freaky tattoos get this weird 

1579
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:45,180
style.
Oh yeah.

1580
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,083
You know,
this other guy is like a boxing fan and 

1581
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,670
teaches a killer yoga class.
It's a,

1582
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:52,110
it's a weird thing,
man.

1583
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,880
There's mutations of it and like,
you know,

1584
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:56,390
people start to make it into the sport 
and do all this stuff.

1585
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,250
People get a little fired up with that,
right?

1586
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,510
Not really into that.
You know,

1587
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,880
what I don't like is the,
uh,

1588
01:14:00,881 --> 01:14:04,440
the dude that takes the shirt off,
the big sweaty older dude that takes his

1589
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:05,810
shirt off.
I mean,

1590
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:09,300
it's 90 percent women.
I just feel like sit in the back,

1591
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:10,223
calm down.
Don't make a scene just as a dude do 

1592
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:15,070
your thing and get out of there.
What do you mean?

1593
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:15,913
He's,
he's got a great gross ponytail and he 

1594
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:21,100
takes his shirt off and take their shirt
off.

1595
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,860
Let's keep their shirt on in your place.
I keep my shirt on.

1596
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,600
C,
no one in my place.

1597
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:26,920
Keeps her shirt on.
No guys,

1598
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:27,640
no.
Yeah,

1599
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:32,290
maybe like one out of 10 I'm sweating so
I'm sweating like an animal.

1600
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,490
One hundred and five degrees in there.
I don't agree.

1601
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,180
Why would you want a shirt on?
I don't do the hot yoga.

1602
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,014
I don't do bikram.
Straight Straight Yoga and I'm straight 

1603
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,440
and you say this should I do is gay.
I don't do your gay yoga.

1604
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,431
What's.
You know,

1605
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:48,490
I'm so sweaty.
Even doing that.

1606
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,920
The I have to keep the shirt on.
My Mat will be so liberal.

1607
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,800
It's disgust.
Scared.

1608
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,130
Don't be scared of us.
Matt there to work out here to sweat.

1609
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,530
Now I.
You know what I'm scared of?

1610
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,423
I'm scared of.
I don't want to offend that little girl 

1611
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:03,990
who's next to me.
Well,

1612
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:05,260
she's in Yoga class,
man.

1613
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,970
I know,
but I just feel like.

1614
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,790
Do you need me with Harry back next to 
you?

1615
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,653
That's you.
Being a comedian is he'll look at me 

1616
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,070
grabbing my clothes on me that I'm sure 
you're probably thinking of material.

1617
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,730
You find me disgusting.
I find me just goes,

1618
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,420
go.
I want to look at myself in the mirror.

1619
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:26,740
Exactly.
It's supposed to be about the act of the

1620
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:27,910
movements.
I know.

1621
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,040
When can you do the movements most free 
for you?

1622
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:30,874
If it's with a shirt on a shirt,
I feel like out of kindness I just keep 

1623
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:35,854
my shirt on and keep a low profile.
Do you tie around the base of your Dick 

1624
01:15:38,351 --> 01:15:39,184
and balls?
So everybody's yoga pants or like a 

1625
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:45,920
board shorts,
title,

1626
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:51,250
same shirts that I run in.
I dress up like a high school gym coach,

1627
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:53,910
sweatpants,
Oldschool,

1628
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:58,810
gray style all the way down there going 
to be so hot,

1629
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,600
hot sweatpants and a and a b class man.

1630
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,260
I should do that one day just to see if 
I can dress like a recipe.

1631
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,740
Like a real thick.
Yeah.

1632
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,250
Cutting weight to the worst if you will.
Those like thick ass old school,

1633
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,600
you know who's making those.
Again,

1634
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:14,733
converse.
Converse is making up fake ass old 

1635
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:20,200
school,
gray sweatshirt,

1636
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,210
back that don't have any markings on 
them.

1637
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,430
Interesting.
And they're really high quality.

1638
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:25,390
I was like,
Ooh,

1639
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,030
this is like old school minimalist.
Yeah,

1640
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,010
I like that.
Yeah,

1641
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,801
I like that.
Look.

1642
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:30,930
I would do that.
And you're like,

1643
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,781
oh,
you're crazy.

1644
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:36,781
Colors and stripes and shit.
Gray sweat shirt,

1645
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:37,901
turn,
color,

1646
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:40,720
pop up doing.
If you weren't a black shirt,

1647
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,760
no one knows if you're sweating.
I had to get real close to you.

1648
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,470
I sweat like a man.
I'm sweating now.

1649
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,780
I've mean the yoga class,
I'm going to be sweating like crazy hard

1650
01:16:46,781 --> 01:16:48,220
work.
It is.

1651
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,910
I love it.
But get high and do it.

1652
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,110
Just try it.
I will.

1653
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,540
I don't know.
I don't know.

1654
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,713
Right.
I'm going to try it or he'll yell at me 

1655
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,760
depending on how much pot smoke.
Joe.

1656
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:03,030
I started and I started.
My heart was racing.

1657
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,390
I started thinking was having a heart 
attack.

1658
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:08,050
You know what?
You need to spray the spray here.

1659
01:17:08,051 --> 01:17:09,100
Jamie.
Jamie.

1660
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,040
Oh,
I did.

1661
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,230
Yeah,
I gave it to the shops.

1662
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,093
I'm here,
but I think.

1663
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,573
Well I'll get some more with me.
I was going to bring you bread today 

1664
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:21,230
because I made this olive Sweden Walnut 
bread and then uh,

1665
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:24,260
I forgot.
Do you ever make spicy bread?

1666
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,600
No.
Crushed red pepper.

1667
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:27,890
Anything in it?
No.

1668
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,010
Is that what you like?
I've had a pretty good like Cheddar,

1669
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,930
crushed red pepper.
There's a couple of good bread places in

1670
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:33,950
Ohio where I'm from.
Oh,

1671
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:36,340
really?
Explore that.

1672
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:40,520
A good pie place.
That makes a good pot pie.

1673
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,200
Pot Pie.
You don't.

1674
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,190
You don't see a lot of pot pies and 
yeah.

1675
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,650
You know that kind.
There's a place in Burbank that does it.

1676
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,523
Reiki outer crust,
the cubes or chicken with that sort of 

1677
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:56,800
yellow broth with the carrots and celery
in there and like woo.

1678
01:17:56,801 --> 01:17:58,830
It's like Thanksgiving and a cup of 
peas.

1679
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,430
Peas,
Goddamn a pot pie.

1680
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,293
I'm spacing on the name,
but there's a place in Burbank and does 

1681
01:18:04,001 --> 01:18:04,834
it.
Five pot pies to die for pis at damn 

1682
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:10,400
delicious meal.
It really is.

1683
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,030
It makes you so warm inside.
It's like the ultimate comfort food.

1684
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,160
It really is.
It might be right,

1685
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:20,240
but you that in a really good meatloaf 
with mashed potatoes and gravy.

1686
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,520
Oh my God.
I have to fuck with that too.

1687
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:23,990
Oh,
that's nice.

1688
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:24,824
That's a slightly different dough.
Put both of those little more butter in 

1689
01:18:28,311 --> 01:18:29,720
that dope.
It's no extra.

1690
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,613
When you make the dough for a pot pie,
you're using like a whole stick of 

1691
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:35,360
butter.
That's what you're talking about.

1692
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,790
That's why it's so God damn good.
So good.

1693
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,693
So good.
I wish they could make cows like 

1694
01:18:41,571 --> 01:18:45,410
engineered cow.
If they they get to this crispr thing,

1695
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,393
you know,
just please make some cows that don't 

1696
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:49,274
have a head.

1697
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,063
Just make some cow and the top of its 
neck is a computer so we don't have to 

1698
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:55,540
think about cruelty.
Yeah,

1699
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,810
there's no consciousness whatsoever.
And just make me a nice butter.

1700
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,470
Grass fed butter.
Headless.

1701
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,680
It would be so much nicer.
Open up its neck and just put grass down

1702
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:08,514
there,
grind the grass up and then pushed it 

1703
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:15,920
and be like a fireplace and you can put 
a neck hole.

1704
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:19,340
You get the butter out the other end so 
it doesn't look so nice.

1705
01:19:19,341 --> 01:19:21,170
No suffering.
How about I don't even have a shape.

1706
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:23,030
Like a cow if you tripping on that.
Yeah.

1707
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:23,864
Yeah.
How about a ball of meat that gives you 

1708
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:27,590
butter?
It's coming.

1709
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,860
I bet you it's coming,
but just giant bag of tits.

1710
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,990
That's all you need is like the other,
the computers take care of all the other

1711
01:19:35,991 --> 01:19:36,800
stuff.
Yeah,

1712
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,633
right.
Just to just to just a warehouse filled 

1713
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:41,020
with tits on a rack.
Yeah,

1714
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,863
just like they,
they engineer of a frame of bones that 

1715
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:50,470
shaped like a basket and in that basket 
is like an inner crust.

1716
01:19:50,471 --> 01:19:51,304
It's like a pot pie crust.
The meat which is the crust of the pot 

1717
01:19:55,551 --> 01:19:58,360
pie and then the inside is all tit 
heavy.

1718
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:02,150
So delightful.
No guilt milk out of that fucker all day

1719
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:02,984
long and it's phenomenal and it just,
it just exists on a substrate of ground 

1720
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:07,980
up grass.
Say you

1721
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,380
have ground up grass all around the 
meat.

1722
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,243
Outer Shell.
Sort of like the aluminum amount of pot 

1723
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:13,914
pie.
You know you have that aluminum foil 

1724
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:15,684
around the edge.
Yeah.

1725
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,533
Would be delightful if somebody gives 
you a pot pie without the aluminum foil 

1726
01:20:18,811 --> 01:20:20,010
around the edge,
they can go fuck them.

1727
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:20,671
So I'm like,
God,

1728
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:22,140
what are they animals,
Monster.

1729
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,030
Good Lord.
Where did you grow up?

1730
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,650
I can't even dig my fork underneath.
Scoop out the dry,

1731
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:33,180
under size with the gravy on top.
That little treat at the end of this,

1732
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,620
the bass,
the bass crest basis,

1733
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:38,580
moist crossed the moistness crust,
right?

1734
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:39,503
The past is you have a little bit of the
top crust to the crunchy outside the 

1735
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,340
ring.
Let's get outta here.

1736
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:48,363
Now you can get a room and just sort of 
pot pies and one of those rooms with 

1737
01:20:51,401 --> 01:20:53,130
that giant per day with the three hoses.

1738
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,540
We're going to need it after this

1739
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,850
pile.
This fucking carbs here.

1740
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,380
When are we going to Musso and frank's?
Oh yeah.

1741
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,420
We're gonna.
Keep talking about.

1742
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,293
We do keep doing that.
We should do that before a set at the 

1743
01:21:04,981 --> 01:21:05,790
store one night.
Yeah.

1744
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:07,590
Let's do that as the move.
Like gentlemen?

1745
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,030
Yeah.
Should we wear suits?

1746
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,440
Yes.
One hundred percent.

1747
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:14,950
Kind of a lighter please.
I have a suit.

1748
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:16,620
No,
you do.

1749
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,870
You to get a suit for a school function 
for my kid.

1750
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,340
Oh really?
What do you mean?

1751
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:22,710
What kind of question one?
I always have one,

1752
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,090
um,
that I,

1753
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:25,290
uh,
were for the UFC,

1754
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:29,940
but the UFC one stays at the EOC so that
I don't have to do anything.

1755
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,040
I just go there.
That's smart.

1756
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,850
I like a nice suit.
He just looked good.

1757
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:38,760
Do you wear pocket squares?
Always look good now.

1758
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,620
When I hosted this TV show I did.
Yeah.

1759
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,010
He was always a pocket square.

1760
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:43,860
Yeah,
they made me.

1761
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,660
They forced that useless piece of cloth.
Right.

1762
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:47,940
There is a funny know when you need a 
tourniquet.

1763
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:53,500
It was a little pocket square and a 
Madonna came in to do the show and uh,

1764
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,373
the whole building was like electric.
It was like Madonna is coming and it 

1765
01:21:57,661 --> 01:21:58,494
really was like energy,
like you could feel energy in the 

1766
01:22:00,811 --> 01:22:02,850
building because Madonna was walking in.
Did you call her Madonna?

1767
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,140
So I came in.
Yeah.

1768
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:04,974
And I was like,
I got to go meet her before the show or 

1769
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:06,684
I'm going to be too freaked out.
So I just walked into the dressing room 

1770
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,620
and I'm like,
Hi Madonna.

1771
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,240
I'm Tom.
She's like,

1772
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,460
nice to see you.
And she walks up.

1773
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:16,280
She goes,
this has got to go

1774
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,520
with the pocket square out.
And like I said,

1775
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,350
I'm not wearing it.

1776
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,183
Guy Ritchie,
her ex husband is a proponent of the 

1777
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:27,004
pocket square guy.
Richie was on my podcast talking about 

1778
01:22:30,161 --> 01:22:33,160
the importance of the suit and having a 
square.

1779
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:37,370
Hilarious because she immediately.
I just met her two seconds.

1780
01:22:37,371 --> 01:22:41,030
He whipped it out of my and tossed it 
there.

1781
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,910
She was at a young Tom pop

1782
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,220
face.
Son of a bitch.

1783
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:47,240
Yeah.
Look at that,

1784
01:22:47,241 --> 01:22:50,380
Mr.
I'll steal your girl with your fucking

1785
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:52,070
do.
I read a lot different now.

1786
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,310
Barbershop different.
Do I look from that shot?

1787
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,850
There'll be honest or what we are.
We went to Delhi.

1788
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:00,470
You gained a couple pounds here.
You're making delicious bread.

1789
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,143
I am.
Did a Ricky Gervais' laugh hard at 

1790
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:07,720
everything.
This is move removed.

1791
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,280
Seems like a jolly fellow.
Especially when Jerry said it.

1792
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,540
A good move.
Yeah.

1793
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,593
Always make Jordan

1794
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,823
say it louder.

1795
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,460
Something about English people,
right?

1796
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,620
Guy Ritchie was describing with his 
English accent.

1797
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,300
The suit.
I was all in.

1798
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:26,683
Damn it.
Where I stopped those at the pocket 

1799
01:23:28,121 --> 01:23:31,000
square.
I might die.

1800
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,670
Motherfucker not wearing a tie.
That was the other thing.

1801
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:34,990
He was talking about ties.
I'm like,

1802
01:23:34,991 --> 01:23:36,190
dude,
no tie.

1803
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,680
Kill somebody with a tie.
Grab a hold of somebody with a tie.

1804
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:39,610
You can kill them.
You,

1805
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:40,830
your,
your broad,

1806
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,370
you've got broad shoulders.
It's like you skinny guys,

1807
01:23:44,371 --> 01:23:46,920
skinny English dudes with a tie.
It's a different thing.

1808
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,873
Well,
the problem with me is that some people 

1809
01:23:49,171 --> 01:23:52,140
have choked me too many times.
I see you.

1810
01:23:52,141 --> 01:23:52,974
Have.
You feel like someone's getting that 

1811
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,850
Hedburg joke.
I've been choked hundreds of times.

1812
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:57,983
Literally the average person has been 
choked with the average person in the 

1813
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:02,730
street.
If they get choked with once or twice in

1814
01:24:02,731 --> 01:24:04,230
their life.
Yet what the fuck happened?

1815
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,950
And the journey from white belt to black
belt.

1816
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,320
I was choked for sure.
Hundreds of times.

1817
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,340
Oh my God.
No idea.

1818
01:24:11,341 --> 01:24:12,174
How many really bad at you asked me how 
many times I have to tap out because 

1819
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,620
someone was choking me.
I'd be like,

1820
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,450
Shit.
Hundreds.

1821
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,460
Hundreds of times for sure.
It has to be.

1822
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:21,910
Especially in the early days,
my game,

1823
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,010
I got choked all the time.

1824
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,140
All the time.
That's not pleasant.

1825
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:28,230
Get choked five slash six times by one 
guy.

1826
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,150
Oh God.
Before I moved to the next guy.

1827
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,910
It's crazy.
So I'm not wearing a fucking.

1828
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:36,180
No,
not doing that,

1829
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:39,190
but I remember how that works.
I'm choking myself,

1830
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,520
grabs you.
If you had to do Jujitsu with a tie,

1831
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:44,370
that's all anybody would go for the 
truth.

1832
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:49,350
Of course everybody had to wear a tie 
and instead of wearing a belt,

1833
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:50,184
everybody has to wear a tie or you can 
take the belt and wrap it around the 

1834
01:24:51,601 --> 01:24:52,580
dude's neck.
Save.

1835
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:55,230
You started with the black belt tied 
around your neck,

1836
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,033
right?
Nobody would go for anything other than 

1837
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:01,800
the belt.
Get a hand under that belt,

1838
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,030
grab it and twist and you're out cold.
I have to do a secure,

1839
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,170
secure some part of your body weight and
keep you from moving in.

1840
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:11,053
Maybe like a side mount or a crucifix 
position where I have trapping arm 

1841
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:18,990
trapped the other arm with my neck and 
I'm going to choke the shit out of you.

1842
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:21,540
This isn't happening at your daughter's 
school function,

1843
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:28,180
but I think it should be.
Grab someone's belt and knock him if.

1844
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:28,560
No,
no.

1845
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,240
If someone had a belt around her neck 
like around the neck,

1846
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,480
you guys Jitsu.
Guys were rolling around.

1847
01:25:33,481 --> 01:25:35,730
The ultimate goal would be to get the 
belt around the guy's neck,

1848
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:37,243
like if you could do that,
that would be the number one thing to 

1849
01:25:38,851 --> 01:25:40,920
do.
And if you already had it,

1850
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:43,490
like nodded around your neck,
like that was how you started,

1851
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,210
were you not around your waist?
Right.

1852
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,750
Keep people would kill each other.
Immediately.

1853
01:25:48,751 --> 01:25:50,960
Grabbed that rope around your neck and 
it.

1854
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:53,190
That'd be the ultimate goal.
Forget foot locks.

1855
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:56,460
Fuck your foot lock.
Like you've done all the work for me.

1856
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,323
Yeah.
I'm going to grab that rope around your 

1857
01:25:57,871 --> 01:25:58,704
neck and put you to sleep.
This is crazy because all you'd have to 

1858
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,160
do is twist it.
You can tell.

1859
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,130
I like I had a choke

1860
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,450
my dog out once.
That way.

1861
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:06,703
Dog was attacking a cat and I got my 
hand inside his collar and I put them 

1862
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:11,660
asleep.
Really?

1863
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,080
Yeah.
You just grabbed.

1864
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,800
I grabbed his collar and I twisted it 
down and cranked it.

1865
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,190
I did you Jitsu on my dog.
Put them right here.

1866
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,290
Knocked them out instantly.
Instantly.

1867
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,750
Yeah.
Just like it does a person resisting.

1868
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:26,080
He didn't know what was going on,
so I got it in there,

1869
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,953
grabbed a of where the buckle is.
I just think I stepped over him and 

1870
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:34,160
cranked on it.
He just went limp when cat took off.

1871
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:35,570
I'm going to try that dude.
It works.

1872
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,870
That shouldn't do it to dogs,
but I mean,

1873
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:39,704
but that's a person too.
It's the idea is the arteries around 

1874
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:44,990
your neck that feed your brain.
You shut those off like a garden hose.

1875
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,060
Think like you.

1876
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:48,500
You fold the garden hose and then the 
water stops falling.

1877
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,140
That's what happens to your brain and 
then you go out.

1878
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:55,390
That's why it's not nearly as dangerous 
as a knockout people's.

1879
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,770
It's just flow.
People get confused about that.

1880
01:26:57,771 --> 01:27:00,350
Like they think that a concussion and 
being choked out.

1881
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:01,940
It's the same thing.
Still giving me your brain damage,

1882
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:02,970
bro.
It's not.

1883
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,870
It's not going to your brain damage.
It happens.

1884
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:06,340
People in class,
they go right back to rolling.

1885
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,300
They don't have no ill effects at all.
Really?

1886
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:09,800
Yeah.
You just go to sleep back to it.

1887
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,660
You wake up and you're like,
what happened?

1888
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:13,610
Like you don't even realize it.
Like what happened?

1889
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:14,181
He's like,
Oh shit.

1890
01:27:14,181 --> 01:27:15,014
That I get choked out and everybody 
starts laughing because that happens in 

1891
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,690
Jujitsu class people.
As long as you're fine,

1892
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,570
people will start laughing because it 
happens to everybody.

1893
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,890
Yeah,
for sure.

1894
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:23,690
If you don't tap,
you go to sleep.

1895
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:26,900
Everybody does.
It sounds fun.

1896
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,490
It is fun,
honestly.

1897
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,250
Yeah.
Till girl does it to super humiliating.

1898
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,280
Right?
When's the last time you were choked out

1899
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,710
by a girl or a guy?
Anybody?

1900
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,873
Uh,
John Jacques Machado tapped me like a 

1901
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:41,340
few months back.
Oh yeah.

1902
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:42,920
But he always Ken.
Yeah.

1903
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:43,783
I don't think it was a joke.
It was an arm bar when you rolled with 

1904
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:47,090
someone who's really good,
you're going to get caught.

1905
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:47,820
Yeah.
Just.

1906
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:48,950
No,
no way around it.

1907
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:50,390
Right?
You want a girl doesn't deal.

1908
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,970
Duncan was taking some classes at CIC.
Kept choking him out.

1909
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,540
It doesn't get,
I'm going to work on this.

1910
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,390
Some people just don't get into it,
you know?

1911
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:02,000
But for people who don't get into it,
I get it.

1912
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,083
Just get into something else that's hard
to just get into something that's hard 

1913
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:06,410
to do.

1914
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:08,360
Would you get high into Jujitsu?
Oh yeah.

1915
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,710
Everybody does.
Oh really?

1916
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:12,050
Oh yeah.
Super popular.

1917
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,640
Makes you better.
Really.

1918
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:14,990
One hundred percent.
Why?

1919
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:19,490
I think you're more conscious of it.
More focused on what you're doing.

1920
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:20,324
It it.
It provides a type of focus and you 

1921
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,730
don't.
It doesn't seem as here's the thing,

1922
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:30,770
the type of consciousness that you have 
when you are rolling with person,

1923
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,633
a person in Jujitsu,
when someone's trying to get you and 

1924
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:33,554
you're trying to defend yourself,
that type of feeling that you get is 

1925
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:40,970
very different than any feeling that you
get in most of life other than an actual

1926
01:28:40,971 --> 01:28:43,340
conflict with the person,
which is pretty rare.

1927
01:28:43,341 --> 01:28:44,810
Luckily we have a nice society,
right?

1928
01:28:44,811 --> 01:28:46,190
Yeah.
If you live in a nice neighborhood,

1929
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:47,983
but that feeling for whatever reason 
lends itself very well to getting high 

1930
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:58,160
because when you get high you get into 
this sort of like not me state,

1931
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:00,020
like an ego dropped off state.

1932
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:02,430
That's one of the reasons why people get
so vulnerable.

1933
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,740
They feel vulnerable because they feel 
like they don't.

1934
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:07,880
They don't have that ego anymore.
It's a very ego diminishing subs.

1935
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:10,920
It's like a almost like a medicine for 
diminishing the ego.

1936
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:13,050
Obviously the effects are different on 
different people,

1937
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,393
but that on top of the focus aspect of 
it makes it really attractive to people 

1938
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:24,420
who do Jujitsu because you can let go of
the bullshit.

1939
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:25,254
You not all tense and then you could 
focus on what you're actually trying to 

1940
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:30,870
do and it doesn't get in the way.
You see things better.

1941
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,033
He thinks you feel things better.
You're more cognizant of how your body 

1942
01:29:34,741 --> 01:29:35,574
works and some people say that that's a 
cop out and that really you should just 

1943
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:41,190
get more comfortable with your body 
period and they're probably right.

1944
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:42,973
It's probably something to that too,
but is there any elements like when you 

1945
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:47,370
get high where you're just like,
it's all cool.

1946
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,233
It doesn't matter because you need.
You need an edge to go fight fighting 

1947
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,070
because you're not hitting each other.
Right,

1948
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,333
and I mean I think it's more of A.
I mean a boxing match is obviously a 

1949
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:02,004
fight,
but it's not in the new definition and 

1950
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:08,890
the new definition it a fight is a mixed
martial arts fight where you're in.

1951
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:10,890
Even then there's rules that are 
applied,

1952
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:11,761
right?
Right.

1953
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:14,400
So like there's no eye gouging.
There's no ball kicks,

1954
01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:16,020
there's no hitting to the back of the 
head.

1955
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:18,360
You can't elbow some of the back of the 
head,

1956
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:23,361
which is in a way healthier for the 
athletes involved,

1957
01:30:23,671 --> 01:30:28,671
but in another way more delusional 
because it removes a very dangerous at.

1958
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:30,700
Like Eddie Bravo is always talking about
that,

1959
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:33,600
that when guys used to take guys back in
the early days,

1960
01:30:33,601 --> 01:30:36,150
what they would do instantly his elbow 
to the back of the head,

1961
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:39,270
like it didn't matter if you defend the 
choke or not.

1962
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,830
If someone starts smashing the back of 
your head,

1963
01:30:40,831 --> 01:30:43,670
you're fucked.
It's a terrible position to be in that.

1964
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:47,670
That is removed from mma.
So because that's removed from mma,

1965
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:49,703
you almost have to look at an mma fight,
which is absolutely a fight as in a way 

1966
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:53,603
kind of a match.
A mixed martial arts math because the 

1967
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:56,604
rules are so rigid,
where much more loose than boxing but 

1968
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:02,940
still rigid.
So you've got a Jujitsu match for sure.

1969
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:05,470
Not really a fight because you get leg 
kicked,

1970
01:31:05,471 --> 01:31:06,304
you can't get elbowed in the face,
you're not going to get need into a 

1971
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:10,020
coma.
It's a totally different experience than

1972
01:31:10,021 --> 01:31:14,430
a fight and it's almost disrespectful.
Some ways to call a Jujitsu match,

1973
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,410
a fight rather,
they would like to refer to it as fight,

1974
01:31:17,411 --> 01:31:18,850
so nothing wrong with that.
Right?

1975
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:21,000
If you don't know and you're just 
looking at it from the outside,

1976
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,680
boxing matches more like a fight,
right?

1977
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,680
Because you're hitting each other in 
this grave danger.

1978
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,260
You're really trying to kill each other,
right?

1979
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,560
I mean you're smashing each other,
right?

1980
01:31:28,561 --> 01:31:31,640
Not trying to kill,
but you are using your,

1981
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:32,533
your explosive force on a person trying 
to take them out and it's a very 

1982
01:31:36,601 --> 01:31:39,900
dangerous encounter with severe 
consequences for your brain.

1983
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,720
Yeah.
That's a fight a lot,

1984
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,500
but it's a fight with very limited 
rules.

1985
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,660
Yeah,
because like a Meu Thai fighter,

1986
01:31:45,661 --> 01:31:46,494
a really good more Thai fighter would 
kill most really good boxers if the 

1987
01:31:51,061 --> 01:31:51,894
boxer didn't know what was going on 
because they're really good Thai 

1988
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:54,983
fighter,
it's gonna be very hard to hit them to 

1989
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:58,110
get that close to him and he's going to 
start kicking your legs immediately.

1990
01:31:58,140 --> 01:31:58,973
What's more time?
It's Thai boxing because they have more 

1991
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:02,640
weapons,
right?

1992
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:06,520
Legs to kick the legs a lot and they'll 
push you away with their front kick.

1993
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,590
There's so much stuff that you're not 
gonna be able to do.

1994
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:09,823
Box will be way better with his hands,
but more Thai fighter is usually pretty 

1995
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:13,234
good with their hands already.
Especially good enough to land a 

1996
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:18,670
shitload of kicks on you and keep you 
from getting in range and if you did get

1997
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:19,890
arranged,
they clench you in.

1998
01:32:19,891 --> 01:32:21,910
They need in the body and the elbow you 
in the head.

1999
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:25,090
It's a way more complete striking system
than regular box.

2000
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,793
Do you feel like there's too many rules?
Like do you feel like it should be just 

2001
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:32,140
opened up in mma?
Like make it real?

2002
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:33,063
Yes and no because I like,
I like specialists like I love that 

2003
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:36,424
conor Mcgregor,
floyd mayweather fight because it was a 

2004
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:38,584
real specialist.
You got to see like a really elite high 

2005
01:32:41,651 --> 01:32:46,651
level striker from MMA become almost 
helpless against a world champion.

2006
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,753
Probably the best advert box you get to 
see this is what happens when a 

2007
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:52,774
specialist fight.
Someone who's really good at something 

2008
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:59,280
like me,
if I wanted to uh,

2009
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:02,710
roll against someone who's like a real 
high level Jujitsu black belt,

2010
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:04,330
I would get,
I would get killed,

2011
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,193
right?
But if you've got a really good jujitsu 

2012
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:10,240
black belt from the UFC,
they would kill me.

2013
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,940
But a really good jujitsu black fruit 
from the UFC.

2014
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:15,580
Mike get killed by a really good Jujitsu
world champion.

2015
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,173
It's like there's all these levels and 
levels and the only way you achieve 

2016
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:23,740
those levels as true specialist,
like a true specialist,

2017
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:27,520
is it such a different level?
Like if you watch,

2018
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,250
you know,
Sanchez,

2019
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,940
you ever heard of Sam Chai?
Thailand.

2020
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,380
He's probably one of the greatest ever 
combat sports athletes ever.

2021
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:39,040
And he's fights every couple of weeks.
I followed him on instagram.

2022
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,050
He's 36 years old,
he's.

2023
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:41,973
He fights people way smaller than him 
all the time and although he knocks a 

2024
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:46,354
lot of people out,
most of his fights are won by him just 

2025
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:52,300
doing shit to the opponent that they 
just can't deal with.

2026
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:55,420
He just kicks the shit out of him.
He hits them when they're not looking.

2027
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:58,840
They don't know what he's doing.
He's so clever and fast or anything.

2028
01:33:58,850 --> 01:33:59,683
I mean he's just a wizard,
a technical wizard inside the ring and 

2029
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,053
when you watch him you realize like,
oh well there's levels even to this 

2030
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:10,840
thing.
This guy is such a specialist at anybody

2031
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:11,674
outside of that,
like floyd mayweather wanted to fight 

2032
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,670
sand Chai lattes,
anti kick him.

2033
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:19,060
It would be one of the most lopsided 
fights you've ever seen.

2034
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:19,923
It would be horrific to watch watching a
world class boxer just getting exposed 

2035
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,870
to legs kicked out from under him,
kicked in the face,

2036
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:27,310
legs kicked out from under him.

2037
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:29,530
No interface elbowed in the head.
Well,

2038
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:32,650
don't you think mcgregor?
If he was allowed to do his thing?

2039
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:33,280
Sure.
Right.

2040
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,360
For sure.
Meanwhile,

2041
01:34:34,361 --> 01:34:35,950
Sanchez Chai could probably do that to 
Mcgregor,

2042
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,530
right?
There's levels and levels.

2043
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:41,920
What Mcgregor and encountered with Floyd
Mayweather,

2044
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,850
he would encounter in Thai boxing with 
like a,

2045
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:47,980
a fantastic one of the greatest ever.
And the guy like San shy.

2046
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,100
So it sounds like the rules actually 
make it more interesting.

2047
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:52,600
They do have to become.
Right.

2048
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:55,600
So the only way you find out who the 
really best Jujitsu guys is,

2049
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:57,570
you have to have them only compete in 
Jujitsu,

2050
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:59,590
right?
Because with strikings,

2051
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,900
all this other stuff involved.
You hurt people with punches and knees,

2052
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,510
but when you want to look at a complete 
system,

2053
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:06,703
complete system,
mixed martial arts is as close as it 

2054
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:08,864
comes without the elbows to the head 
kicks when the down to the head on down 

2055
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:15,140
fighter and the stomps and the knees to 
the head on a down fighter.

2056
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:15,993
Right.
And then the really dirty shit like 

2057
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:21,410
eyeball pokes and the balls.
So it's always going to be a match.

2058
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,200
You can't bite someone's nose off.
It's always going to be a match.

2059
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,493
Right.
You know what I mean?

2060
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,720
There's got to be some limit.
Yeah.

2061
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:29,970
Yeah.
But you still call it a fight,

2062
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:32,500
right?
So how,

2063
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:36,750
how many hills to I have to run to get 
back into my old shape?

2064
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:40,060
Well,
I think it's this whole fucking God damn

2065
01:35:40,061 --> 01:35:41,830
delicious bread you're making.
That's an issue.

2066
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,350
So,
you know what happened?

2067
01:35:46,351 --> 01:35:47,184
I uh,
I visited this a woman in Ohio who's 

2068
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,400
really good bakers.
Kate spreads anchors.

2069
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:54,780
Yeah.
She's amazing.

2070
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:59,040
And I saw it flower she had.
I'm like,

2071
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,690
oh,
I gotta get that flower.

2072
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,380
That's what I got to get this one out.
So I looked up online where she gets the

2073
01:36:04,381 --> 01:36:06,510
flower comes from Utah.
Whoa.

2074
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,480
And the smallest you can get as a 50 
pound bag.

2075
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:10,973
So I have 2:50
pound bags of wheat and artists and all 

2076
01:36:14,521 --> 01:36:17,550
purpose flour in my kitchen.
And I'm like,

2077
01:36:17,551 --> 01:36:21,810
I was thinking like if you were to eat 
50 pounds of flour,

2078
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,380
you would be a big fat.
So dude.

2079
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,560
But the flower makes such a difference.
Huge difference.

2080
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:29,993
You know,
what I discovered recently is a double 

2081
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:35,970
zero wheat pasta from Italy.
Double Zero.

2082
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:36,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2083
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,310
You do.
Most folks don't.

2084
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,720
Yeah.
Now Double Zeros.

2085
01:36:39,721 --> 01:36:42,240
What you use for pizza dough.
Yeah.

2086
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:43,890
The good stuff,
right stuff,

2087
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,530
and I also found out about heirloom 
wheat,

2088
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,813
heirloom wheat,
that most of what we're getting here in 

2089
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:55,590
the United States of good old Morocco is
a wheat that has been.

2090
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,740
People love that term GMO.
Right.

2091
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:00,570
It scares the shit out of people.
Gmos.

2092
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,130
Super Organic.
Yeah.

2093
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:03,600
Good.
All good thoughts.

2094
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,480
But the reality is most of the wheat we 
have,

2095
01:37:06,481 --> 01:37:07,314
according to,
you know maynard Kenyan from tool 

2096
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,710
[inaudible],
the singer of the singer.

2097
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:14,450
He also owns a this great vineyard 
owner,

2098
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:15,480
right?
Yeah.

2099
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,100
And a restaurant.
Oh yeah.

2100
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:21,300
She was explaining to me.
He explained it on the podcast about the

2101
01:37:21,301 --> 01:37:24,690
differences between the wheat we have 
today and the original wheat.

2102
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:29,040
The wheat we have today has much more 
complex gluten's in it and it's a larger

2103
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,820
yield for the same area.
So when they would grow the old wheat,

2104
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:34,470
they.
They didn't make as much of it,

2105
01:37:34,471 --> 01:37:36,240
but it was easier for a person to 
digest.

2106
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,440
Right.
Interesting.

2107
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

2108
01:37:39,361 --> 01:37:40,194
There's a huge.
There's so many of these little farmers 

2109
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,290
and little.
Some are pretty big for being little,

2110
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:48,270
but compared to what these giant things 
are,

2111
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,033
they really concentrate on growing the 
wheat the way they used to be grown and 

2112
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,070
then the mill it the way it was.

2113
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,750
Seeds though.
Yeah,

2114
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,850
and it's.
It makes such a difference.

2115
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:01,500
Like just.
I was like,

2116
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:02,334
how big of a difference can it be just 
in making the bread that I'm making a 

2117
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:08,100
huge.
I would imagine it tastes like,

2118
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,380
like to lie natural.
Yeah.

2119
01:38:10,381 --> 01:38:12,000
It's earthy,
it's deep.

2120
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:14,130
It's like it's really good.
Earthy,

2121
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:17,280
earthy is good.
Now it made a big difference,

2122
01:38:17,281 --> 01:38:18,114
but now I've got to figure out how I'm 
going to store 50 pounds of 100 pounds 

2123
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:21,174
of flour.
You'd probably have to do it in a 

2124
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:22,920
controlled environment.
No,

2125
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:27,510
I gotta go bad.
You got to just put it in barrels.

2126
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,890
Does it have to be dry and air or.
Yeah.

2127
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,053
Yeah.
But it's good for a long time when you 

2128
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:33,200
do it that way.
Yeah.

2129
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:34,290
Yeah,
and I'm,

2130
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,233
I'm still learning and cranking out a 
lot and giving it away and stuff and so 

2131
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:39,594
I'm going through a lot and won't sit 
forever the way it's been described to 

2132
01:38:42,271 --> 01:38:43,104
me,
the differences between the difference 

2133
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,840
of like a tomato that you get in a 
grocery store today,

2134
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:51,740
even a good one in comparison to an 
heirloom tomato makes perfect sense that

2135
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,593
those tomatoes that we have today,
like Neil degrasse Tyson did a speech 

2136
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:57,690
about this where someone was asking him,
not a speech,

2137
01:38:57,691 --> 01:38:58,770
but the answer to a question.

2138
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:00,323
I think it might've been in one of those
talks that he does those town hall talk 

2139
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,133
and someone was asking him about Gmos 
and he said virtually everything we eat 

2140
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:10,790
has been modified.
Yeah.

2141
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:11,693
Everything from the oranges to the corn.
Like you wouldn't go want to go back to 

2142
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:17,550
the original corn.
It wouldn't taste good.

2143
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:18,423
It wouldn't be a lot of yield to it,
but then the real problem is the corn 

2144
01:39:21,391 --> 01:39:24,570
that we have today.
Not that easy for us to digest.

2145
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:27,300
Right.
And not that good to eat a lot of it,

2146
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:30,660
you know,
it's all like how much of it do you use?

2147
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:32,910
Yeah,
but when you do eat a tomato,

2148
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:33,744
like an heirloom tomato,
you get a farmer's market that this guy 

2149
01:39:35,791 --> 01:39:39,060
grew in this tiny little farm and just 
happens to have them that week.

2150
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,650
Phenomenal.
Phenomenal.

2151
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,330
But I don't think that's the same with 
corn.

2152
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:43,523
Now.
I think that golden sweet corn that we 

2153
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:47,310
have today that tastes like candy,
that's the best shit.

2154
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:50,480
That's pretty good.
You know,

2155
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,230
you put butter on that.
Yeah.

2156
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:54,200
Wrap it in aluminum foil.
Put It on the grill.

2157
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:57,950
Oh,
bullshit ass original pine cone.

2158
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,823
Looking your heart as court.
Stupid people would hang that stupid 

2159
01:40:04,311 --> 01:40:05,144
corner on their door on thanksgiving.
The Indian court up with that on 

2160
01:40:09,651 --> 01:40:11,300
Annabelle.
Bullshit ass.

2161
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:15,350
Multiracial.
Scaring children away.

2162
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:19,490
Halloween.
It's still weird colored.

2163
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:20,870
And he asked her,
what are you?

2164
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,140
All kinds of shit.
Yeah.

2165
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:26,540
Just just try and eat me if you can.
That was the original corn,

2166
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:28,130
but it wasn't even that.
That's like,

2167
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,040
it adds.
No,

2168
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:29,770
that's.
Yeah.

2169
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:30,520
Yeah.
That's,

2170
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,760
that's the core.
And people put.

2171
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:32,623
Wait,
what is that?

2172
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,693
Cornell ooky corn,
children of the corn at some spooky 

2173
01:40:39,471 --> 01:40:40,041
corn,
right?

2174
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:43,340
They ever seen the original corn.
See if you can find original

2175
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,233
corn plant images.
I still want to know how much tobacco 

2176
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:49,550
rowers get paid.
I couldn't find much.

2177
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,413
The only thing I found was an article 
about a guy that just started a 

2178
01:40:52,581 --> 01:40:53,414
business.
It said somewhere in there that are as 

2179
01:40:55,031 --> 01:40:55,864
cheap as they could be made was like 
thirty cents a piece and it was 

2180
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:01,090
expensive as $5 a piece for the cigar 
itself.

2181
01:41:01,091 --> 01:41:02,580
It didn't say that included,
uh,

2182
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,920
the wells are a highly skilled wrapper 
to do it.

2183
01:41:05,921 --> 01:41:10,090
So it might be being paid per,
per cigar.

2184
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:12,520
They rule fifty cents per if they're 
doing like a bunch in a row,

2185
01:41:12,521 --> 01:41:15,070
you know,
and it didn't say whoever wrote this did

2186
01:41:15,071 --> 01:41:16,870
a great job.
You did a fantastic job.

2187
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,890
It's easy.
Draw,

2188
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,230
easy draw.
Last name,

2189
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,900
Nice Long,
great podcasts if you're into scars were

2190
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:25,510
um,
Ari Shaffir sat down with Robert Kelly.

2191
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:28,090
They smoke cigars.
And Bobby Kelly said,

2192
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,280
is that what it really would like?

2193
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:30,183
Bobby Kelly is a crazy fucking.
He's gonna smoke crazy with the cigars 

2194
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,400
or the original corn looked like,
like bullshit.

2195
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:37,720
What?
Yeah,

2196
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:42,640
that's the original corn is a size of a 
quarter and the quarter with that.

2197
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,080
Wow.
That is crazy.

2198
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:46,660
The original corn versus the new corn.
Wow.

2199
01:41:46,661 --> 01:41:49,390
That's really wild.
Wild.

2200
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,780
And that shit was all done through like 
splicing.

2201
01:41:52,781 --> 01:41:53,710
Right?
Right.

2202
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:56,230
That was natural.
Look with corn used to look like.

2203
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,173
That's weird.
It looks like it looks like the route 

2204
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:03,541
that came out of your toilet to small,
big modern corn looks like the route.

2205
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:07,030
That's crazy,
right?

2206
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:07,864
I mean,
corn used to be this tiny little low 

2207
01:42:09,311 --> 01:42:11,370
yield product.
Well,

2208
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:14,290
that's jelly bean corn.
That's amazing.

2209
01:42:14,291 --> 01:42:16,870
Glass gem corn glass.
Gem Corn.

2210
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:19,120
I bet that tastes like shit.
Yeah,

2211
01:42:19,121 --> 01:42:21,010
it's terrible.
That can't be good.

2212
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,640
Otherwise people would eat it,
but yeah.

2213
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,420
You ever get a cotton candy?

2214
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,520
Grapes.
What is that?

2215
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:28,301
Jamie?
Black.

2216
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:30,670
Waxy corn.
What's black?

2217
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:31,780
Waxy corn.
Wow,

2218
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:33,850
that looks amazing.
It looks pretty good.

2219
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,290
It looks like licorice.
Like you bite into it,

2220
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:38,050
which is cool.
I would eat that.

2221
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:40,600
I would eat dead too.
I would think that like if you went over

2222
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:43,630
a clever person's house to interview 
that black corn,

2223
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:46,150
you'd be like,
experience even better.

2224
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,860
What are those purple potatoes come from
Peru,

2225
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:48,694
right?
That's probably the same area as this I 

2226
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:53,410
think.
Is it Peruvian purple potatoes and that.

2227
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:54,730
Ooh,
look at that one.

2228
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,593
That's crazy.
That looks like the alien from the 

2229
01:42:57,071 --> 01:42:58,460
Geiger.
It's Dick.

2230
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,833
Go back to that.

2231
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:06,700
The tongue comes out and fucked his 
jabs.

2232
01:43:06,701 --> 01:43:10,510
You in the head with that and then it,
it shoots the baby into your body.

2233
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:12,343
You just within your just sitting there 
eating dinner like in the wrong sport 

2234
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:18,550
grows out of your dead body.
I can't believe that,

2235
01:43:18,551 --> 01:43:21,220
uh,
that the corn didn't.

2236
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:26,320
I think between the original core and 
being that weird Nabi thing and the corn

2237
01:43:26,321 --> 01:43:29,780
that we have year round,
I think there's probably an era in there

2238
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,300
were the corn tasted better,
right?

2239
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,203
Like the life of the taiga,
the evolution of human beings to 

2240
01:43:37,271 --> 01:43:40,150
technological superiority.
Where we're at today,

2241
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,640
you got to meet it halfway.
That's the sweet spot.

2242
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,940
The sweet spot where there's no stopping
it.

2243
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,370
He's no stopping it.
We're moving forward,

2244
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:51,800
there's no stopping it,
but maybe this spot is not sweet spot.

2245
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:54,800
Just like living in a cave wasn't the 
fucking sweet spot.

2246
01:43:55,070 --> 01:43:57,050
Right?
It was just a sweet spot for the time.

2247
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:57,913
Yeah.
Right now you don't want to go live on 

2248
01:44:00,171 --> 01:44:01,400
the tiger.
No.

2249
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:02,690
Tom Pump.
I can't.

2250
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:03,850
You can't?
No.

2251
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:05,660
It'd be exhausted.
How are you going to bake your bread?

2252
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:07,510
Am I going to make bread?
Flour.

2253
01:44:07,511 --> 01:44:09,230
You gonna have to grow it.
Oh my God.

2254
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:11,140
You've got to mill your own bread.
Do you manage?

2255
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:13,310
If you had to grow your own fucking 
wheat to make your bread?

2256
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,840
Yeah,
we would never make bread with judo.

2257
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,090
May probably would.
Maybe I'll plant the seed right now.

2258
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:20,983
Maybe you're gonna leave here.
You're going to be driving home your 

2259
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,620
electric car.
You're going to be thinking,

2260
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:26,390
Hey,
fuck.

2261
01:44:26,391 --> 01:44:27,224
All this comedy bullshit when I do is 
get a big piece of land and start 

2262
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:32,930
growing my own wheat and then chopping 
it down,

2263
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:36,050
make my own bread and have Tom Papa's 
bread restaurant.

2264
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:41,470
I've given this a lot of thought.
I have something,

2265
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,393
so not about throwing it all away,
but there's something about a going 

2266
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:52,610
bigger and deeper into it.
It's kind of just draws you in.

2267
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:55,250
I'm not even making decisions.
There's just like,

2268
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:56,373
oh,
now I'm getting bigger things of flour 

2269
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:00,950
and it's just.
Yeah,

2270
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,820
there's something very all consuming 
about it.

2271
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,920
Yeah,
it's good.

2272
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:07,963
You know,
whenever you get something that gets 

2273
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:09,623
that,
it's rewarding and I like that it's 

2274
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:12,470
small.
I like that it's,

2275
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:16,370
there's no bullshit around it.
There's no phone calls to be made.

2276
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:19,940
It's just all on my own terms but does 
in my control.

2277
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:20,774
Does that appeal to you as an overall 
life or does it appeal to you as a 

2278
01:45:23,931 --> 01:45:26,600
vacation from the current life that you 
enjoy?

2279
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:30,590
Which is very hectic and kinda stressful
writing material,

2280
01:45:30,591 --> 01:45:32,180
performing,
traveling.

2281
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,900
You know what it is?

2282
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,170
I feel like A.
I don't know.

2283
01:45:36,171 --> 01:45:37,004
It's an interesting question.
I do feel like the process of making it 

2284
01:45:39,621 --> 01:45:44,621
and doing it is a.
It matches up with writing really well.

2285
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:46,543
When I'm.
When I'm at home and I'm writing a lot 

2286
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:53,060
and in between taking breaks and going 
and tending to the bread and then coming

2287
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:56,780
back to the writing that back and forth 
is very satisfying.

2288
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,640
Nice.
It is the best.

2289
01:45:58,710 --> 01:45:59,810
That was nice.
Yeah.

2290
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:01,063
Yeah.
I often thought writing in some ways 

2291
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:05,990
releases you from the stress.
A lot of people find a performing.

2292
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:08,120
The just writing.
Yeah.

2293
01:46:08,121 --> 01:46:10,340
I heard nor Mcdonald's.
It's that on his,

2294
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:11,174
uh,
on his show that he just wants to write 

2295
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:15,110
books.
He just wants to write that before.

2296
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:19,340
I've heard that before where people just
want to go internal and stop being.

2297
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:20,930
I know,
but I former,

2298
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,220
I feel like,
uh,

2299
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,710
I,
I couldn't do that 100 percent.

2300
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:25,990
I really love it.
I have this.

2301
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,640
My Book's gonna come out next year.
It's a plug.

2302
01:46:28,641 --> 01:46:31,460
I see what you did sign up.
You can't even buy it yet,

2303
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:34,460
but it is coming out soon.
Be planting seeds,

2304
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:37,400
a planting seeds,
seeds for people to buy the book.

2305
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:39,410
I see what you're doing and it's not 
yet.

2306
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,530
It's not like I'm plugging my Gig at 
comics.

2307
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,260
He can sign or anything.
Well,

2308
01:46:43,261 --> 01:46:44,810
you there,
when is that?

2309
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:46,340
It's coming up next week.
Oh,

2310
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:47,750
interesting.
No,

2311
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:49,530
I,
I feel like I,

2312
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:50,010
when I was

2313
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,650
writing the book,
I got very deep into an I love coming in

2314
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:56,310
with my coffee in the morning,
going to work for hours just in there,

2315
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,870
tinkering with it,
playing with it.

2316
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,480
It was very satisfying.
It makes sense,

2317
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:04,770
but after,
after several days of not being onstage,

2318
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,260
start getting itchy,
he get itchy.

2319
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:08,430
It's not who I am.

2320
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:14,040
Do you think that it's that you've 
experienced these jolts of fun,

2321
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:15,343
that you get from standup,
that you become addicted to these jolts 

2322
01:47:18,111 --> 01:47:22,370
of fun and then seeing the happiness and
people's faces when they're laughing?

2323
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:24,800
Yeah.
That relating to people,

2324
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:30,090
that isolation of writing is okay,
but until I can take that idea out,

2325
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,640
share it with other human beings.
That's what I'm.

2326
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:41,410
For what you've designed yourself that 
way.

2327
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:43,810
Sort of like you look at the human race,
we've,

2328
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:47,710
we've grown to this place where if you 
made people like,

2329
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,410
were you here during the heatwave?
Yeah.

2330
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:51,911
Yeah.
Weird,

2331
01:47:51,911 --> 01:47:52,744
right?
Yeah.

2332
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,020
It was intense.
It got intense.

2333
01:47:55,021 --> 01:47:56,740
It was a little spooky.
It was,

2334
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:59,290
yeah,
because like really people were on edge.

2335
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:00,183
Yeah.
Well,

2336
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:02,920
quietly on edge waiting for the AC to 
go.

2337
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,490
Right.
If the AC goes down,

2338
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:07,000
where are we going to deal with this?
Because this is not.

2339
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,490
You have to just get in the shower all 
day.

2340
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:10,120
Yeah.
No,

2341
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,650
it's intense when it's only got 110.
Yeah.

2342
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:15,760
You can stay in the shade and you'll 
stay reasonably cool,

2343
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,100
but it's.
It's way hotter than you want it to be.

2344
01:48:18,101 --> 01:48:19,180
Yes.
You're not sleeping,

2345
01:48:19,181 --> 01:48:20,014
right?
No,

2346
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:21,460
no.
Sweating like a pig.

2347
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,070
Yeah,
like the people in Florida right now.

2348
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:26,770
There's a lot of people that don't have 
power.

2349
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:28,420
Yeah,
and it's humid.

2350
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,200
Hot as fuck.
Yeah.

2351
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:31,660
Fans blowing.
No.

2352
01:48:31,661 --> 01:48:33,690
It's not good feeling where you're like,
oh,

2353
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,120
I've always thought no disrespect people
from Florida,

2354
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:38,223
but that's one of the reasons why people
think of people that live in the south 

2355
01:48:41,201 --> 01:48:42,034
as being dull because the thing for the 
longest time before they invented air 

2356
01:48:46,391 --> 01:48:48,130
conditioning,
they,

2357
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:49,930
those fucking people didn't have time to
think.

2358
01:48:49,931 --> 01:48:50,764
Deep core move quickly.
You're not going to think your best 

2359
01:48:54,311 --> 01:48:57,370
thoughts when you fucking sweating like 
a pig and you're exhausted all the time.

2360
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,460
Why getting the power back on in Florida
could take weeks.

2361
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:03,700
Oh Jesus Christ.
Fuck that.

2362
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,530
That's rough.
It is rough weeks.

2363
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:10,390
Why'd you bring up that?
Why'd you bring up the,

2364
01:49:10,391 --> 01:49:13,120
uh,
whether it was here during the heat wave

2365
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,073
because it was so evident to me during 
that time that we really can't even 

2366
01:49:17,921 --> 01:49:18,754
exist in this environment without the 
way we do and enjoy the way we live 

2367
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:23,763
without the modern conveniences of 
electrical grid air conditioning units 

2368
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:30,994
and the delivery of food and all this 
shit that we just get like super 

2369
01:49:33,701 --> 01:49:34,534
accustomed to.
So we think now of life without that 

2370
01:49:39,221 --> 01:49:42,610
stuff as being like impossible.
But at one point in time we were adapted

2371
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:44,073
one point in time life without that,
like those fucking people that live in 

2372
01:49:46,151 --> 01:49:46,984
the taiga,
the worst it gets for them as it gets 

2373
01:49:48,341 --> 01:49:49,174
crazy cold,
they bundle up and they go inside and 

2374
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:51,844
they burn wood,
but they have like a whole system built 

2375
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:55,720
in to survive that environment.

2376
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,180
For us,
that would be unthinkable.

2377
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:02,170
Like your house doesn't have central Ac,
you don't have heat,

2378
01:50:02,171 --> 01:50:03,580
you don't have a thermostat.
Wait a minute.

2379
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:05,380
Wait,
hold on.

2380
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:06,383
See Walk in your house.
That thing doesn't glow in the wall and 

2381
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:10,280
show you the temperature you've walked 
by.

2382
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:12,200
It exists things.
Yeah.

2383
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:14,710
It's not programmed where it's Kinda 
knows I'm home.

2384
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:15,820
Yeah.
A friend of mine's house,

2385
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:19,480
you walk towards his thermostat and it 
lights up.

2386
01:50:19,481 --> 01:50:21,460
It senses your senses.
You're there,

2387
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,250
right?
Hey.

2388
01:50:23,251 --> 01:50:24,700
Yeah.
It shows you the temperature,

2389
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,110
like it's off.
Like you'll step away.

2390
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:26,953
It'll dim up and he's standing right in 
front of it and it lights and like this 

2391
01:50:29,261 --> 01:50:30,170
is freaky.
Yeah.

2392
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:31,900
It's pretty nice.
People don't have that man.

2393
01:50:31,901 --> 01:50:33,040
They have.
Windows does shut.

2394
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:35,020
Yeah.
They fire.

2395
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:37,600
Fire keeps the heat in.
Bundle up.

2396
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:41,350
Now I couldn't put animal skins on.
Yeah.

2397
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:43,120
That's what people do now.
I'm not doing that.

2398
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:44,523
Yeah,
I'm not.

2399
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:47,350
No.
So we've adapted for sure to this.

2400
01:50:47,351 --> 01:50:49,690
You and I have adapted to this.
The question is,

2401
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:52,060
who's happier?
What's it better?

2402
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:52,760
Is it better?

2403
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,593
I'm pretty happy when I walk in after,
after that heat wave and I would walk 

2404
01:50:56,081 --> 01:50:56,914
into my house.
You take your shoes off and your bare 

2405
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,800
feet on the cold tile.
I'm pretty happy.

2406
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,590
I'm happier than the tiger guy.
Yeah.

2407
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:08,420
Watch TV.
All these hurricanes brewing in the goal

2408
01:51:09,050 --> 01:51:09,883
G.
Yeah.

2409
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,850
But I've found that,
uh,

2410
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,110
that writing is very,
uh,

2411
01:51:15,111 --> 01:51:16,700
and uh,
as I was writing,

2412
01:51:16,701 --> 01:51:20,540
I was reading a lot of writers and stuff
and it's very isolating.

2413
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:24,110
Like the more you write,
the more you are shutting out the world,

2414
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:26,570
the more you are you.
It's a hermit's life.

2415
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:27,720
It is,
it really is.

2416
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:29,210
In a way.
It's not a,

2417
01:51:29,211 --> 01:51:30,044
uh,
you are very much within your own head 

2418
01:51:32,691 --> 01:51:35,840
and eating up a lot of time just being 
by yourself.

2419
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:39,140
It's a,
it can be rewarding for sure,

2420
01:51:39,141 --> 01:51:39,974
but it's a.
If you were to write all the time like 

2421
01:51:42,681 --> 01:51:44,270
that,
it's pretty isolating.

2422
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,750
Well,
it's also in a lot of ways,

2423
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:49,120
almost like a mental marathon because 
you're,

2424
01:51:49,121 --> 01:51:52,510
you're on this one thing for a long 
time.

2425
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:56,500
Sitting there staring at this thing and 
you're writing and you're thinking about

2426
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:57,334
it and you're focusing on it and you're 
going back at it and you thinking about 

2427
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:00,364
it and you focus on becomes like a part 
of your daily thoughts even when you're 

2428
01:52:03,011 --> 01:52:04,120
not doing it.
Sometimes.

2429
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:09,500
What was really remarkable was when 
you're writing your standup in blocks,

2430
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:11,383
it's like chunks and I was thinking,
how am I going to keep track of like a 

2431
01:52:14,821 --> 01:52:19,260
whole book,
but your subconscious really does like I

2432
01:52:19,261 --> 01:52:23,520
know exactly where things are.
I would glide through it and no,

2433
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,860
I think I have to change this part and 
see on my notes.

2434
01:52:25,861 --> 01:52:27,840
Yes indeed.
That is where I was going to change it.

2435
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:29,213
It is.
Your brain starts to take in all that 

2436
01:52:33,691 --> 01:52:36,570
information and treat it like chunks.
You know what I mean?

2437
01:52:36,571 --> 01:52:38,940
It's no different really than writing 
your standup.

2438
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:40,613
Do you.

2439
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,710
Do you take notes like chapter chapter 
notes,

2440
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,400
like you have like a notebook that you 
have sitting on the side

2441
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,293
and you like say chapter one,
here's all the things that I like or 

2442
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:50,234
don't like or not that specifically,
but if there's something that I can't 

2443
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,340
wrestle to the ground and I'm like,
I gotta fix that ending.

2444
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:58,550
I'll just write on the side Pan,
page 35,

2445
01:52:59,410 --> 01:53:00,680
you know,
and then keep going.

2446
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:03,890
And you writing like this.
What's the,

2447
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:08,630
what's the subject of the book?
It's a funny essays about family life.

2448
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:10,520
Okay.
So it's all just different.

2449
01:53:10,521 --> 01:53:12,680
Different chapters about everybody in 
your family,

2450
01:53:12,681 --> 01:53:13,970
your parents,
your kids,

2451
01:53:13,971 --> 01:53:15,530
your uncles,
cousins,

2452
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:20,710
everything that makes up family.
So it's all these little,

2453
01:53:21,190 --> 01:53:26,190
they're like 300 pages and each one is 
probably four pages,

2454
01:53:26,661 --> 01:53:28,400
five pages,
you know what I mean?

2455
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:33,500
How long have you been working on it?
I'm a little over a year.

2456
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:34,820
Ooh.
Yeah.

2457
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,810
And it's like this week it goes back and
I don't get it back.

2458
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:39,230
Who?

2459
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:40,250
This is it?
Yeah,

2460
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,550
this is great.
Yeah.

2461
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:43,613
Yeah.
Done.

2462
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,950
Yeah.
I'm not like sick of it.

2463
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:46,843
No.
But yeah,

2464
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:49,190
pretty proud of parts of it,
but every time you look at it,

2465
01:53:49,191 --> 01:53:50,960
you're like,
how did I let that go?

2466
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:52,820
This is terrible.
This is so corny.

2467
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:55,280
How did I let that joke in the way that 
you know?

2468
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:56,593
But uh,
do you find that sometimes you have an 

2469
01:53:57,711 --> 01:53:59,300
idea that you're not getting out 
totally,

2470
01:53:59,301 --> 01:54:00,134
but you leave it as is,
as a place holder and you review it 

2471
01:54:02,331 --> 01:54:03,590
later.
Yeah.

2472
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:06,080
Like maybe you feel like there's 
something in this idea,

2473
01:54:06,081 --> 01:54:08,030
but whatever I have right now is shit.
Yeah.

2474
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:10,870
But maybe there's something if I just 
leave it there like that,

2475
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,260
maybe I'll come at it from a different 
angle,

2476
01:54:12,261 --> 01:54:15,410
but at least then I know to think about 
this one subject that I thought had some

2477
01:54:15,411 --> 01:54:15,860
promise.

2478
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:17,120
Yes.
One hundred percent,

2479
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:21,080
100 percent.
And I really feel like it kind of taught

2480
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:26,081
me how much your subconscious goes to 
work on it without you being conscious.

2481
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,650
Like you don't realize that your brain 
is actually going,

2482
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:33,080
it's going to work on this.
When you shut out,

2483
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:36,350
shut the computer and walk away,
you think that's it?

2484
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:37,753
Your brain is still going at it without 
you even being aware that it's 

2485
01:54:41,151 --> 01:54:41,984
happening.
He ever read Stephen King on writing a 

2486
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,620
book.
It's a great book.

2487
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,330
The things.
One of the things I thought was the most

2488
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:51,150
shocking was that he doesn't really like
have a,

2489
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:54,710
like a whole outline of the stories 
started writing them.

2490
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:57,440
It's crazy.
It's just as an idea and just go,

2491
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,390
yeah.
Which is brilliant.

2492
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:01,580
You fucking amazing.
You gotTa Trust Yourself.

2493
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:03,770
You just gotta you gotTa.
I mean,

2494
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:05,660
he's a brilliant mind,
but you know,

2495
01:55:05,661 --> 01:55:08,660
when I was a kid,
his books were thought of as like fluff,

2496
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:11,480
but if you read Stephen King,
you weren't really reading.

2497
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:12,920
He's.
Yeah,

2498
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:15,560
well that happens when you're really 
popular.

2499
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:17,420
It was a little bit of that,
right?

2500
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,710
Um,
but it was also that,

2501
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:20,480
oh,
you're just reading monster stories.

2502
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:21,314
It's so stupid.
He should be reading about depressed 

2503
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:24,780
heroin users.
Then you'd be like,

2504
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:26,083
exact,
deep.

2505
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:28,190
Yeah.
Middle aged crisis in Europe,

2506
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,031
you know,
hey man,

2507
01:55:29,031 --> 01:55:29,864
this is alphabet city.
In the 19 sixties these people were 

2508
01:55:31,611 --> 01:55:35,270
doing smack you listening to Lou Reed 
and punching each other.

2509
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:37,190
That guy.
I mean,

2510
01:55:37,191 --> 01:55:38,024
how you ever go to the bookstore and 
look at the Stephen King Section in the 

2511
01:55:40,761 --> 01:55:42,830
bookstore.
It's a whole.

2512
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:43,980
It's a whole part of

2513
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,860
the store.
This guy just cranks it out.

2514
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:51,000
Amazing.
There's definitely errors though.

2515
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:52,350
There's like.
You know what?

2516
01:55:52,351 --> 01:55:54,860
I feel like.
I feel like there's drugs and no drugs.

2517
01:55:54,861 --> 01:55:58,050
Stephen King drug.
Stephen King is the shining,

2518
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,960
carry,
cujo dead zone zone.

2519
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:04,860
All the crazy shit.
All the dark weird,

2520
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,800
twisted.
No inhibition whatsoever.

2521
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:09,143
Shit.
And then he's like more content now and 

2522
01:56:12,481 --> 01:56:16,630
probably a healthier person than the 
stores aren't quite as fucked up as it.

2523
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,600
Yeah,
it was fucked up.

2524
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,740
But there's that one.
Mr.

2525
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:21,890
Mercedes,
the newer ones,

2526
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:22,890
the newer ones.
Oh,

2527
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:24,960
he's still got it in him for sure.
Dark.

2528
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:25,913
Oh,
for sure.

2529
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,780
Mark.
What's not just dark,

2530
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:31,380
like if you go back and read carry.
It's not just dark.

2531
01:56:31,381 --> 01:56:35,320
It's like the psychological profile of 
this poor torment.

2532
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:39,600
A young girl with telekinetic powers is 
fucking fantastic.

2533
01:56:39,601 --> 01:56:41,430
He has nailed it.
Oh my God.

2534
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:44,100
Point where you want her to make those 
kids heads explode.

2535
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,060
You want her to cause accidents.
'Em Girl.

2536
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:51,120
These assholes.
Like finally the tormented and picked on

2537
01:56:51,121 --> 01:56:53,130
girl has an option.
I mean,

2538
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:53,964
he made it perfect.
He made really created the ultimate 

2539
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:59,430
outsider,
some poor kid that was unfortunate to be

2540
01:56:59,431 --> 01:57:02,650
born into a situation where a mother was
completely psychotic cunt.

2541
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,583
Yeah.
And people were trying to fucking throw 

2542
01:57:05,071 --> 01:57:07,110
a pig's blood honor and run her over 
with a car.

2543
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:08,250
So mean.
Yeah.

2544
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:12,530
But she and she,
they faked that fucking handsome guy was

2545
01:57:12,531 --> 01:57:15,540
going to go to the prom with her dump 
blood on her and they all thought it was

2546
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:16,374
fun and they were laughing at her and 
she got back and I'm all because we 

2547
01:57:19,471 --> 01:57:20,304
realized that for the worst case 
scenario for a human is someone that 

2548
01:57:24,391 --> 01:57:29,391
could do that to some poor misfortunate 
girl like carry without killing her.

2549
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:33,510
These are the worst people that you 
could imagine.

2550
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:38,770
She had this fucking ace in the hole.
Power they never saw coming.

2551
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,970
Fucking great.
So great.

2552
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:44,970
He's amazing.
He's good hazing.

2553
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:47,160
But I remember people telling me like,
that's all fluff.

2554
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:51,040
I'd be like,
pet cemetery must shining.

2555
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:53,340
Read that book.
Shaming is not fluff.

2556
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,490
It's not fluff.
It's not flopping.

2557
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:58,470
Book is fucking fantastic.
Oh my God.

2558
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:00,450
And the book,
that guy goes crazy slow.

2559
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:01,813
It takes a while.
That's what he didn't like about the 

2560
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:06,330
original Jack Nicholson version,
the Kubrick version,

2561
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:09,390
which is fantastic,
but it was a different story.

2562
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:10,403
I can see the argument that that story 
was more adaptable to a film that takes 

2563
01:58:13,801 --> 01:58:14,440
place over,
you know,

2564
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,950
two plus hours or whatever.
Whereas his book,

2565
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:19,500
it would have to be like a 30 hour 
movie.

2566
01:58:19,501 --> 01:58:22,590
Yeah.
It's a long process of Jack.

2567
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:24,530
Maybe 30 hours.
Yeah.

2568
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:27,060
Yeah.
When he really starts going nuts and the

2569
01:58:27,061 --> 01:58:32,061
family realizes he's actually losing his
fucking mind and taken over by something

2570
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:36,420
that lives in this house.
It's good.

2571
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,510
He felt like Jack Nicholson,
I think if I remember correctly,

2572
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:41,030
his,
his criticism,

2573
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,750
the Jack Nicholson seemed crazy 
immediately.

2574
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,820
Oh really?
He was already crazy.

2575
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:49,330
Like either hurt the kid wants.
When he was drinking,

2576
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:51,040
he was fucked up.
I don't know if that was in the book,

2577
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:51,874
I don't remember,
but that Jack Nicholson's character was 

2578
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:54,874
too crazy right away.
It wasn't enough of a transition like 

2579
01:58:58,830 --> 01:59:00,990
was Chad and Chad

2580
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:03,500
just check the,
uh,

2581
01:59:03,501 --> 01:59:08,390
the one thing I took away from that,
from his book on writing was,

2582
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:10,100
uh,
just get to the end,

2583
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:11,720
don't share it,
don't talk about it,

2584
01:59:11,721 --> 01:59:14,180
just keep going,
get to the end,

2585
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:18,890
don't judge yourself,
just get to the end and then start going

2586
01:59:18,891 --> 01:59:20,700
to work on it.
And uh,

2587
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:24,370
that really was helpful getting to the 
end of this because.

2588
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:25,213
And then it actually became really fun 
going back and fixing it and fixing it 

2589
01:59:28,851 --> 01:59:30,980
up.
And even like just the clarity,

2590
01:59:30,981 --> 01:59:32,900
like,
just make it simple.

2591
01:59:32,901 --> 01:59:35,390
Just make it,
get this message across,

2592
01:59:35,391 --> 01:59:38,870
like why am I taking three paragraphs,
repeating myself,

2593
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:42,500
pare it down,
peel it off,

2594
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:44,940
make it clear for the,
for the reader.

2595
01:59:44,941 --> 01:59:47,840
And he didn't want to go in circles.
Make this very like,

2596
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:50,330
oh,
at times I'll read articles in the paper

2597
01:59:50,331 --> 01:59:52,850
or something.
And it's like not understanding it.

2598
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:56,630
It's not that I'm not understanding is 
that this isn't written well,

2599
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:59,120
this isn't clear.
That's your job.

2600
01:59:59,121 --> 02:00:01,160
Like just going back and trying to 
clear.

2601
02:00:01,161 --> 02:00:04,400
I mean like sometimes when you have a 
bit and you're like,

2602
02:00:04,401 --> 02:00:08,090
you're working on new stuff for your 
stand up and you have something,

2603
02:00:08,091 --> 02:00:10,670
it's like this big chunk and then when 
you're done working on it,

2604
02:00:10,671 --> 02:00:11,504
it's down to like five lines [inaudible]
you learned how to say it so 

2605
02:00:14,871 --> 02:00:17,000
effectively.
So direct.

2606
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:18,283
Yeah.
And you realize the parts that just you 

2607
02:00:19,081 --> 02:00:21,790
were enjoying them but they were 
tripping you up the whole bit.

2608
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,370
Right?
They were getting in the way.

2609
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:24,383
They were like,
you're asking the audience to think 

2610
02:00:25,261 --> 02:00:26,250
about this,
why?

2611
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,620
It's just getting in the way.
Just

2612
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:30,470
confusing the clarity of the original 
thought.

2613
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:31,853
You know,
a already has this piece of paper that 

2614
02:00:33,711 --> 02:00:34,544
he has glued to the top.
This keyboard that's a hemingway quotes 

2615
02:00:36,951 --> 02:00:38,870
is the first draft of everything is 
Shit.

2616
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,550
Oh Nice.
Yeah,

2617
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:42,140
that's great.
It takes the pressure off.

2618
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:43,220
Well,
it's also real.

2619
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:44,463
It's like really,
really just get it out there and don't 

2620
02:00:45,681 --> 02:00:47,750
think that it's done.
And Hemingway writing.

2621
02:00:47,751 --> 02:00:48,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2622
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:50,060
He,
his first draft was shit.

2623
02:00:50,061 --> 02:00:53,090
So yeah,
my little stuff is going to end up shit.

2624
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:57,380
It's like Stephen King Hemingway was 
fucked up all the time,

2625
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,800
like Stephen King's early days was 
Stephen King really fucked up.

2626
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:01,850
Oh.
Oh,

2627
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:04,150
he was a book.
Oh Man.

2628
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,020
I don't remember that part.
Yeah.

2629
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:06,873
Do you mean he was just drinking cases 
of budweiser and fucking doing coke and 

2630
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:14,990
he said he didn't even remember writing.
Carrie what?

2631
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:16,270
Yeah,
I didn't even remember it.

2632
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:20,120
Now it came in a haze or is it cujo?
Holy Cow.

2633
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:21,103
Carrier.
Cujo.

2634
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:24,590
Cujo didn't remember writing Cujo I 
think it was in A.

2635
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:25,753
I don't know.
I might,

2636
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,080
I might be wrong.
It might be carried,

2637
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:30,560
but just he was one of those books.
What does it Cujo.

2638
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:31,490
Thank you.
Wow.

2639
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,353
So to be so blasted it didn't remember 
writing one of the great horror books 

2640
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,870
ever.
Oh my God.

2641
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,190
And a horror book

2642
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:43,820
about a rabid dog or a giant rabbit dog 
that used to be everybody's friend.

2643
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:44,663
So scary.
I read that as a kid like in a summer 

2644
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:51,870
and just you were in that car with that 
kid with the mom just like,

2645
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:53,370
oh yeah,
God,

2646
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:56,940
his just slobber on the.
On the window next to you.

2647
02:01:57,450 --> 02:01:59,220
Dude.
So he was that messed up?

2648
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,790
Yeah,
it was selfish.

2649
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:03,090
Yeah.
I mean he was doing everything.

2650
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:05,460
When did he get clean?
Years back.

2651
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:07,740
I think his wife put the hammer down.
Yeah.

2652
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:12,030
They gave like a family and friends 
staged an intervention.

2653
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:14,370
You're around that time.
Oh yeah,

2654
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:15,500
here.
Got that bad.

2655
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,570
So doesn't say see late eighties I 
guess.

2656
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:19,111
Yeah.
See,

2657
02:02:19,111 --> 02:02:19,944
so I'm not,
I don't want to say that he couldn't 

2658
02:02:21,121 --> 02:02:23,520
have written amazing stuff without 
drugs.

2659
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:27,240
No.
But the original stuff that he did,

2660
02:02:27,241 --> 02:02:28,410
he was.
But well,

2661
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:29,263
I mean was it that he was just fucked up
and he was writing amazing stuff or was 

2662
02:02:33,931 --> 02:02:36,510
it that he was writing amazing stuff 
cause he was fucked up.

2663
02:02:36,511 --> 02:02:37,344
But clearly it has an effect on your 
mind and your mind is where all your 

2664
02:02:41,041 --> 02:02:43,530
creativity allegedly is coming from.
Right?

2665
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:45,420
I mean,
you're writing and you're concentrating.

2666
02:02:45,421 --> 02:02:47,970
The way you're thinking about things 
directly affects the work.

2667
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:48,953
So if you're thinking about things on 
coke and drinking and you got this 

2668
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:52,593
psychotic overview of life on earth and 
the interactions that people have with 

2669
02:02:56,071 --> 02:02:56,780
each other.
And.

2670
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:59,730
And this is what you're right,
this is how you're writing influenced by

2671
02:02:59,731 --> 02:03:02,190
these drugs as a giant effect on 
creativity.

2672
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:07,270
Sure.
But without talent to harness it and you

2673
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:08,571
know,
Oh yeah,

2674
02:03:08,571 --> 02:03:09,404
totally get you.
If you don't have that talent that he 

2675
02:03:11,001 --> 02:03:13,640
has unquestionably,
you can get just fucked up and then just

2676
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:16,100
you don't do anything with it.
It sit in your room,

2677
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,420
you know,
but he,

2678
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:22,690
it's a real talent there that then the 
drugs influenced that.

2679
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,720
It's manipulating that giant talent.
I mean,

2680
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:29,610
you could also say the same about a lot 
of great comics like Kennison and prior,

2681
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:33,750
obviously they had a great relationship,
bad relationship with some drugs,

2682
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:38,040
but there were also fucking super 
talented on top of that for sure.

2683
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:39,061
Yeah.
It's a,

2684
02:03:39,061 --> 02:03:40,710
it's a fascinating thought,
right?

2685
02:03:40,711 --> 02:03:43,170
It's like what?
What are your thoughts and where,

2686
02:03:43,171 --> 02:03:44,004
where are these coming from?
Are they coming from the environment 

2687
02:03:46,831 --> 02:03:49,800
that you live in?
The things you've been exposed to,

2688
02:03:49,801 --> 02:03:51,870
the pros and the cons,
the goods and the bads.

2689
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:53,950
He'll be here.
I'm sure you have,

2690
02:03:53,951 --> 02:03:56,200
but I'll ask it anyway,
but you ever hear,

2691
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:59,710
I'm a singer,
songwriters.

2692
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:03,510
Talk about where the songs come from.
Privilege.

2693
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,630
Yeah,
but they,

2694
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:09,630
a lot of times they talk about catching 
them out of the air that they're there.

2695
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:11,710
They weren't like they didn't come from 
me.

2696
02:04:11,711 --> 02:04:16,000
They all have this overwhelming feeling 
like it came from somewhere else.

2697
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,740
What do you make of that?

2698
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:19,010
For sure.
Think they,

2699
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:21,110
you know,
Steven pinker calls it the muse.

2700
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:24,540
He uses the expression,
the Muse or the,

2701
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:25,393
you know,
the idea of the muse and that even if 

2702
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:31,640
it's not like a real muse,
like some sort of a guardian thing,

2703
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:32,474
but treat it like it is with respect to 
like show up to work in that musical 

2704
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:37,710
show up more often.
Like

2705
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,843
tune it in and have it come to you.
But I think it comes back to what we're 

2706
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:43,860
saying about ego and like getting out of
your own way.

2707
02:04:43,861 --> 02:04:47,190
Like sometimes when you're writing,
you're so immersed in these thoughts and

2708
02:04:47,191 --> 02:04:49,350
these ideas that you are out of your own
way,

2709
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:53,220
that that tunnel.
Then the booze and the coke and the weed

2710
02:04:53,221 --> 02:04:54,054
or whatever the fuck you're doing helps 
you stay in that crazy zone of just 

2711
02:04:56,941 --> 02:04:57,774
letting these ideas sort of create 
themselves in your mind and letting the 

2712
02:05:01,221 --> 02:05:02,054
story play itself out in your brain,
but how much of it is from within your 

2713
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:08,430
brain and how much is it in the ether?
It's good question.

2714
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:11,910
Does that mean and what is it?
What does that mean?

2715
02:05:11,911 --> 02:05:12,744
Floating around in the ether and letting
in you just being a thing where it can 

2716
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:16,620
kind of show up.

2717
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:18,150
Yeah.
You know,

2718
02:05:18,151 --> 02:05:18,984
is it just harnessing us?
I mean because whenever you talk about 

2719
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:24,270
meditating or even the yoga or the 
Jujitsu,

2720
02:05:24,271 --> 02:05:29,130
all that stuff we're talking about,
it is a relationship to the universe,

2721
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:29,881
right?
Right.

2722
02:05:29,881 --> 02:05:34,881
It is a relationship to these forces 
that are outside of ourself.

2723
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:38,040
It's interesting.
It is,

2724
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:40,980
and it's probably.
I mean,

2725
02:05:40,981 --> 02:05:41,814
every human being is a combination of so
many different experiences in genes and 

2726
02:05:46,590 --> 02:05:49,240
environment and the culture they live 
in.

2727
02:05:49,241 --> 02:05:50,074
I mean,
there's so many different factors that 

2728
02:05:51,061 --> 02:05:51,894
would effect your creativity to.
There's so many different factors that 

2729
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:59,150
would affect the way unique ideas enter 
into your head.

2730
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

2731
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:01,643
And you know how much.
How much respect do you pay to those 

2732
02:06:02,911 --> 02:06:03,744
ideas?
How much time do you spend alone with 

2733
02:06:04,471 --> 02:06:05,580
those ideas?
Right.

2734
02:06:06,450 --> 02:06:08,370
Can you focus on a lot of different 
things?

2735
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,503
Like if you were writing,
can you focus on your act and another 

2736
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:13,110
project?

2737
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:14,250
No.
It's hard,

2738
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:14,821
right?
No,

2739
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:16,650
I'm not good at that.
I've tried that.

2740
02:06:16,651 --> 02:06:18,240
I don't,
I don't do so well at that.

2741
02:06:18,241 --> 02:06:22,530
I write different things,
but if I have like a main project,

2742
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:25,830
like the main I'm trying to do a special
or something like that.

2743
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:26,664
The main project,
it's always got to be the standup and 

2744
02:06:28,261 --> 02:06:31,270
then all these other things that I write
are just fishing for more standup.

2745
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:31,950
Right.
You know,

2746
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:36,840
so I don't.
A lot of times I don't write like try to

2747
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:39,030
sit down and write a specific joke.
Yeah.

2748
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:41,580
I get a joke and then I right on the 
joke,

2749
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:46,470
but I get a joke from writing blogs more
like almost like essays.

2750
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:47,513
So I'll,
I'll start thinking about a subject in 

2751
02:06:48,451 --> 02:06:49,284
this way.
I'm not restricted to a punchline 

2752
02:06:50,701 --> 02:06:52,200
format,
I just,

2753
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:55,800
I'm just trying to like explore all the 
different things that I think about this

2754
02:06:55,801 --> 02:07:00,000
and then I might find one or two gems in
there and then I extract those and I go,

2755
02:07:00,001 --> 02:07:01,670
okay,
well how do I get that jam?

2756
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:02,963
Turn it into how does.
I know there's a thought there that 

2757
02:07:04,591 --> 02:07:05,430
makes sense.
Yeah.

2758
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:07,230
How do I do that without all that other 
bullshit?

2759
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:08,413
How do I get to it quick?
I really think that great standup is 

2760
02:07:10,490 --> 02:07:11,323
like poetry because that's all pairing 
you down to this one simple way to 

2761
02:07:15,691 --> 02:07:18,120
deliver all of that thing in that blog.
Right?

2762
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:20,430
That's why tweets are so good.
Like you know,

2763
02:07:20,431 --> 02:07:23,070
I'm Ian Edwards was telling me about 
that,

2764
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:25,890
but like writing tweets and writing like
little face posts,

2765
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:30,060
facebook posts like having real limited.
He would just sit there and try to write

2766
02:07:30,061 --> 02:07:30,894
like really funny shit on twitter and 
that forces you to boil it down to 140 

2767
02:07:35,441 --> 02:07:36,010
characters,

2768
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,940
you know?
Yeah.

2769
02:07:36,941 --> 02:07:40,590
It's a skill you had eight is the 
definite like you,

2770
02:07:40,591 --> 02:07:41,424
you learn how to have like a quickly 
impacting thought as opposed to like 

2771
02:07:45,191 --> 02:07:49,390
some long or like he ever read.
I mean I've been guilty of it too.

2772
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:50,224
I've written some stuff like that,
but the long drawn out stupid shit that 

2773
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:56,950
could have been like parse down and it's
almost like,

2774
02:07:56,951 --> 02:07:59,140
come on man,
don't put this out there yet.

2775
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:01,180
First draft.
Yeah,

2776
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:02,410
right.
Oh my God,

2777
02:08:02,411 --> 02:08:03,244
yeah.
The world is filled with those specials 

2778
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:06,550
right now.
Those specials,

2779
02:08:06,551 --> 02:08:11,551
those articles and so much so much to 
just kinda hanging out.

2780
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:12,820
Yeah.
You know,

2781
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,700
it's a,
it's an interesting thing,

2782
02:08:15,701 --> 02:08:17,680
but I really do.
I did like the,

2783
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:21,790
the process of,
of having to write it,

2784
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:23,700
you know what I mean?
Like knowing that someone's,

2785
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:28,420
someone out there is waiting for him.
This thing in it was kind of a,

2786
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:29,350
it was pretty cool.

2787
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:32,230
That's why people like doing specials 
too because you know that like,

2788
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:33,064
Hey,
I have to film this thing in six months 

2789
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:37,270
so I have x amount of work to do.
You've got to get it done.

2790
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:38,203
Right.
As opposed to if you don't have a 

2791
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:40,771
hanging out.
Yeah,

2792
02:08:40,771 --> 02:08:42,940
just doing sets.
How much you writing?

2793
02:08:42,941 --> 02:08:43,890
I'm writing a little.
Yeah,

2794
02:08:43,891 --> 02:08:44,724
I'm doing it.
He realized that same new joke is six 

2795
02:08:46,961 --> 02:08:49,650
months old or a year old or two years 
old.

2796
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:52,330
Years old or I mean how many guys you 
know like that,

2797
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:56,290
but there's so much comfort in the port.
You know,

2798
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,153
you're already in port.
You don't want to go back out to that 

2799
02:08:58,241 --> 02:08:59,920
ocean of ideas.
Right,

2800
02:08:59,921 --> 02:09:01,600
exactly.
It's nice and safe over here.

2801
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,140
I've been working on his house and I got
to go out again.

2802
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:07,373
I got this act.
I got a nice and honed the hurricane's 

2803
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:14,610
coming out my beach side house.

2804
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:16,420
I got to rebuild.
I can't possibly,

2805
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:17,970
I can't do that.
Look,

2806
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:19,480
I can't grow.
I'm 70 years old.

2807
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:22,270
There's no learning.
It's over.

2808
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:24,040
I'm done.
You are what you are.

2809
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:25,180
I'm done,
man.

2810
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:28,040
You are what you are.
So uh,

2811
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:29,920
can we talk about what you did 
yesterday?

2812
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:31,640
Sure.
Uh,

2813
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:33,610
because you sent me a pretty cool 
picture.

2814
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,540
Oh,
the elk.

2815
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:36,060
Oh my God.
Holy.

2816
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:39,280
Do that once a year.
That was massive.

2817
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:40,180
Yeah,
it's huge.

2818
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:42,670
Big Animal.
How Big Wild Elk?

2819
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:46,210
Thousand pounds probably.
She's big animal.

2820
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,710
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2821
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,490
And how long?
Uh,

2822
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:53,290
did it just come where you set up in one
spot and it kind of crossed your path?

2823
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:57,780
Was a couple of days of trying to get 
close to one couple days that that's,

2824
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,650
that's really quick.
Wow.

2825
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,720
Usually it's a lot more days,
but you know,

2826
02:10:01,721 --> 02:10:05,020
you're obviously sometimes you'll have 
encounters with an elk,

2827
02:10:05,370 --> 02:10:06,203
like your very first morning.
It was a picture of the rack on that is 

2828
02:10:09,311 --> 02:10:13,030
amazing.
It's a big animal that is huge rack.

2829
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:17,110
Yeah.
That's the most one of the most majestic

2830
02:10:17,111 --> 02:10:19,150
of all wild animals.
That is amazing.

2831
02:10:19,151 --> 02:10:19,984
I mean that is a mountain of an animal.
These animals get killed so often by 

2832
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:30,010
mountain lions,
like mountain lions in particular.

2833
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:33,470
And how old is he?
You think there's,

2834
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,320
I don't know.

2835
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:37,760
I mean that's.
How long did it take to grow that rack?

2836
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,630
You know,
what's really crazy?

2837
02:10:38,631 --> 02:10:41,930
They drop them off every year and they 
regrow them quick every year.

2838
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:42,783
Yep.
So that grows that quickly within a 

2839
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,220
couple months.
Oh my God.

2840
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:47,750
Really insane.
It's like one of the.

2841
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:50,540
It looks like it's growing things in 
nature.

2842
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:53,000
I would think that was around for 20 
years.

2843
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,721
No,
no,

2844
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:54,071
no,
they,

2845
02:10:54,071 --> 02:10:56,410
they dropped those off every year.
Oh my God.

2846
02:10:56,420 --> 02:11:00,230
That's where you can tell a very 
specific,

2847
02:11:00,231 --> 02:11:01,064
like there's very specific 
characteristics of certain antlers and 

2848
02:11:03,951 --> 02:11:07,040
you can tell by the sheds if it's the 
same antler,

2849
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:09,020
if you catch them like a year later,
man.

2850
02:11:09,021 --> 02:11:10,000
Oh Man.
One,

2851
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:11,390
one Arrow,
one arrow.

2852
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:14,840
Really?
What do you aim for the lungs?

2853
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:16,790
Like the vitals,
the lungs.

2854
02:11:16,791 --> 02:11:20,330
The heart kills him.
Like the lungs get deflated and they die

2855
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,060
quick.
He,

2856
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:23,360
he fell within five seconds.

2857
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,980
Really?
From an Arrow?

2858
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:26,570
Yeah.
And then it takes a few seconds for them

2859
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:28,850
to expire,
but never knew we were there.

2860
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:29,863
He had no idea where were there.
So how long were you in the spot where 

2861
02:11:32,091 --> 02:11:32,891
you were?
We,

2862
02:11:32,891 --> 02:11:33,724
we were trying to get to him for a 
couple of hours because he was 

2863
02:11:36,831 --> 02:11:37,664
screaming.
They scream when they're trying to get 

2864
02:11:39,171 --> 02:11:41,180
laid and they tried to pick up chicks.
Oh really?

2865
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:43,550
Fight each other to the death.
We find dead ones.

2866
02:11:43,551 --> 02:11:45,000
They're really.
Yeah.

2867
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:46,860
You find them all the time.
They,

2868
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:49,550
one of them they found though had a 
mountain lions,

2869
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:52,400
a claw stuck in its head,
which is really crazy.

2870
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:53,250
You're really.
Yeah.

2871
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:57,860
They found this one that had been chewed
up and uh,

2872
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:58,753
when they,
um,

2873
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:01,790
you know,
when I think one of them dies,

2874
02:12:01,970 --> 02:12:05,270
they want to find out like what killed 
them and think that you,

2875
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:06,183
you bring the skull to like fish and 
game and they do an examination on 

2876
02:12:10,281 --> 02:12:12,300
whatever they can to see what's going on
at the same.

2877
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:13,670
It was poached,
you know,

2878
02:12:13,820 --> 02:12:17,300
sometimes people will shoot an animal 
and then I'm just,

2879
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:20,030
they're not supposed to be there.
Like there's people are assholes,

2880
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:20,960
man.
Like Ted Nugent,

2881
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:23,150
a place in.
Some people are obviously,

2882
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,403
Ted nugent has a place in Michigan and 
it's this big giant fenced in deer park 

2883
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:33,640
that he has hundreds of acres.
And uh,

2884
02:12:33,670 --> 02:12:37,760
one day while he was not there,
someone killed like all of his books.

2885
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:40,700
So they climbed the fence,
just shot them all and just shot him and

2886
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:41,311
left them.
Yeah.

2887
02:12:41,311 --> 02:12:42,144
I just shot him and I'm like,
people have done terrible things like 

2888
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:45,950
that.
So I think there's one,

2889
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:46,813
they have to think about that they find 
a dead one and also they have to think 

2890
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:51,990
about what's killing it.
Is it a bear that's killing it?

2891
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:53,293
Not that usual.
They're pretty big for a grown bear to 

2892
02:12:55,761 --> 02:12:56,594
attack that bear and a grizzly bear in 
America or there's no grizzlies in 

2893
02:13:01,281 --> 02:13:03,220
California rather.
But um,

2894
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:06,530
they do get jacked by grizzlies in 
Wyoming really.

2895
02:13:06,531 --> 02:13:07,790
Especially their,
their babies.

2896
02:13:07,791 --> 02:13:08,624
Almost all their babies would have 
grizzly fight it for food or protect 

2897
02:13:12,711 --> 02:13:13,310
itself.
No,

2898
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:14,500
for food.
Oh yeah.

2899
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:15,050
Yeah,
it was.

2900
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:16,640
You don't have to protect yourself from 
an elk.

2901
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:17,923
Right?
You have to protect yourself from a 

2902
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:19,940
moose.
Moose,

2903
02:13:19,941 --> 02:13:20,900
uh,
try to fuck you up.

2904
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,080
Yeah.
Different animals.

2905
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:24,950
They evolve around grizzly bears all the
time.

2906
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:25,963
So they were up in Alaska.
There's a certain parts of America they 

2907
02:13:28,821 --> 02:13:30,770
are too,
but I ran into one in dental.

2908
02:13:30,771 --> 02:13:31,950
Ronald.
Yeah.

2909
02:13:31,951 --> 02:13:32,070
You

2910
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,020
can find them in Colorado.
In Wyoming.

2911
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:37,200
I think I told you that story.
I came around the trail.

2912
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:38,413
We were back country for a couple of 
weeks and we just came around this 

2913
02:13:41,371 --> 02:13:43,140
trail.
It was a baby moose,

2914
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:45,690
like on the middle of the trail are 
like,

2915
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:46,950
oh,
it's so cute.

2916
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:52,130
It was like he just heard it's mom's got
to be around the year and this.

2917
02:13:52,490 --> 02:13:54,240
Yeah,
this we got out of there really quick.

2918
02:13:54,241 --> 02:13:56,370
A friend of mine has a ranch,
British Columbia,

2919
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:59,220
and he was on his horse and he got too 
close to the baby.

2920
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:02,310
So the mother Moose start chasing them 
at full clip.

2921
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,233
Oh Man.
It was fucking terrifying because the 

2922
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:08,310
Moose is so much bigger than his horse.
Gigantic.

2923
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:09,173
Oh,
he was on a horse on a horse and he's 

2924
02:14:10,681 --> 02:14:11,514
just hoping that the horse can get away 
from this fucking Moose sprinting at 

2925
02:14:14,641 --> 02:14:18,930
them and if the most will knock you off 
the horse and stomp you to death.

2926
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,430
She's there.
Yeah.

2927
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:22,683
That is scary.
You catch a mama when she's around her 

2928
02:14:24,961 --> 02:14:27,800
babies and she decides you're a problem.
And what about the out?

2929
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,470
Does that have a Laker you?
Would that run you down?

2930
02:14:31,471 --> 02:14:33,030
Like if it's all you and felt 
threatened?

2931
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:34,470
No,
they're not as aggressive.

2932
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,510
They're not the same.
There'll be a mean.

2933
02:14:36,511 --> 02:14:38,280
They would they.
If you got close to them,

2934
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:40,290
especially during,
like right now,

2935
02:14:40,291 --> 02:14:43,410
which is called the Rut,
which is when once a year they get laid.

2936
02:14:44,130 --> 02:14:47,130
Once a year they grow these giant 
antlers and they get ready to fight.

2937
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:49,610
Those antlers are not to fight off 
predators that.

2938
02:14:49,611 --> 02:14:51,940
To fight each other.
Yeah.

2939
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,000
They go to another dude.
Yup.

2940
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:58,890
They go to war for smash each other for,
for chicks.

2941
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,920
Really craziest animals of all time.
That's why scream man,

2942
02:15:04,111 --> 02:15:06,180
like our lord of the rings out.
It's like,

2943
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:10,830
oh my.
Yeah.

2944
02:15:10,831 --> 02:15:15,831
And then the females go let out.
This may sound like kind of give me some

2945
02:15:15,961 --> 02:15:16,794
deck.
And they're like,

2946
02:15:16,990 --> 02:15:17,823
I've got some

2947
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,513
different.
Different

2948
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:22,780
it is.
He yelling so she'll come to him.

2949
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:24,490
He's just yelling.
So she'll come to him.

2950
02:15:24,610 --> 02:15:27,330
She's mewing.
So here you listen to this here.

2951
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:31,950
This is from Youtube.
Terrifying elk scream.

2952
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:34,620
This is what they sound like.
That looks just like the one.

2953
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:42,343
It gets louder than that though.
So it's all it's got or is it just keep 

2954
02:15:45,351 --> 02:15:46,700
going.
He's adorable.

2955
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:48,680
Yeah.
That's not too loud.

2956
02:15:50,420 --> 02:15:51,800
That's it.
That's weak.

2957
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:54,920
Look at that big glass rack.
Whoever put that video up,

2958
02:15:54,921 --> 02:15:57,070
that is a lie.
It's not terrified.

2959
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:58,550
Not terrified here.
That bitch.

2960
02:15:58,551 --> 02:15:59,384
You better stay home if you're in your 
tent at night and you heard that you'd 

2961
02:16:01,221 --> 02:16:02,054
be a little scared to see if you could 
find a better one because there's some 

2962
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:04,364
awesome one amazing elk bugle.
So you were in one spot for a couple of 

2963
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:12,410
hours after you heard that.
We spotted him in the distance.

2964
02:16:12,411 --> 02:16:13,244
We spotted him on the hill with 
binoculars and then you've got to play 

2965
02:16:16,191 --> 02:16:18,110
the wind.
You got to get close to him.

2966
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:20,540
You got to figure out which way the wind
is blowing.

2967
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:22,100
So he didn't smell you?
Yeah.

2968
02:16:22,101 --> 02:16:25,100
The wind changes as the day goes on 
because the.

2969
02:16:25,190 --> 02:16:27,230
The ground heats up.
What is this

2970
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:32,893
crazy?

2971
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:42,820
How about that?
That's scary.

2972
02:16:42,850 --> 02:16:46,070
Is moves going to war in Alaska?
Moose battle.

2973
02:16:46,100 --> 02:16:48,130
They go to war,
like run on people's lawns and shit.

2974
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:49,740
Fuck up their cars.
She's,

2975
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:50,703
I mean there's so big.
A Moose is like twice the size of an 

2976
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:54,310
elk.
Twice the size.

2977
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:55,060
Oh yeah.
Moves.

2978
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:57,760
Get to like eight mooses misses two 
pieces.

2979
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,810
They it's really big and get to like 
1800 pounds.

2980
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:04,030
Holy Cow.
They're huge.

2981
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:06,430
They're so big.
They don't even look real cheese.

2982
02:17:06,610 --> 02:17:07,443
I saw one that my friend Ben,
a shot in Alaska for NBC in British 

2983
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:15,010
Columbia and when it was walking across 
the road,

2984
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,450
there was like a dirt road that we were 
wrong.

2985
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:19,180
We saw walk from one section,
the forest into the neck.

2986
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:20,403
It looked like.
Remember that war of the worlds movie 

2987
02:17:22,290 --> 02:17:27,290
with Tom Cruise with thing child legs,
like walking over cars.

2988
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,770
Like Holy Shit.
Can you eat moose?

2989
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:35,470
Oh yeah.
Do you ever hunt for Moose?

2990
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:37,800
Yeah,
I shot once.

2991
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:38,890
Yeah,
that at that time,

2992
02:17:38,891 --> 02:17:39,581
man,
I shot a moose.

2993
02:17:39,581 --> 02:17:40,930
That's Moose right there.
This is it.

2994
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,570
A real young Moose.
That's why it doesn't have much antlers.

2995
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:47,320
Have a big asset of Atlanta.
What's better to eat?

2996
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:49,240
This is the most redneck.
You really can't say it.

2997
02:17:49,330 --> 02:17:51,070
What's better to eat?
Moose is fantastic.

2998
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:54,350
Moose and elk are real similar.
Similar is really good to know.

2999
02:17:54,430 --> 02:17:55,263
All wild game.
If it's healthy and it's prepared 

3000
02:17:57,820 --> 02:18:01,960
correctly and taken care of correctly,
it's got an amazing taste to it.

3001
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:05,830
It's just really like nutrient dense 
protein dense,

3002
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:08,800
very different than any other edits.
Again,

3003
02:18:08,801 --> 02:18:09,634
if you want to eat meat in my eyes,
like this is the best meat for you and 

3004
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:14,374
the best case scenario because it's just
not like a factory farmed animal and 

3005
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:19,270
kill it.

3006
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:24,270
It's fate is sealed by mountain lions or
bears or wolves depending on where it is

3007
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,080
or starvation or freezing to death and 
it has a very short life.

3008
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:30,070
Yeah.
Oh really?

3009
02:18:30,071 --> 02:18:31,040
Yeah.
I mean if,

3010
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:34,750
if you find a nine year old elk,
Holy Shit.

3011
02:18:34,751 --> 02:18:36,100
How's that?
Even possible.

3012
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:37,373
Yeah.
Fifty percent of them in grizzly bear 

3013
02:18:39,191 --> 02:18:40,024
areas,
they get killed by bears when they're 

3014
02:18:41,711 --> 02:18:43,920
babies.
That's a high percentage of fonds.

3015
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:47,050
One out of two fonds get killed deer 
fawns too.

3016
02:18:47,051 --> 02:18:48,640
And a lot of grizzly bear infested 
areas.

3017
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:50,010
Wow.
Yeah.

3018
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:51,213
Uh,
I tried making that elk steak that you 

3019
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:54,760
gave me an eye.
I've messed it up.

3020
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:55,720
Yeah.
Well,

3021
02:18:55,721 --> 02:18:59,860
you gotTa Cook it very lightly.
You don't want to like cook.

3022
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:02,020
You should use a meat thermometer.
I'll give you.

3023
02:19:02,021 --> 02:19:05,020
It wasn't long.
I did a short amount of time,

3024
02:19:05,021 --> 02:19:06,400
but it was wrong.
Uh,

3025
02:19:06,401 --> 02:19:07,630
I think he said that,
uh,

3026
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:08,710
there's some layer that.

3027
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:09,910
Oh,
the silver skin.

3028
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:11,050
Yeah.
Fascia.

3029
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:12,250
I didn't take that.
Well,

3030
02:19:12,251 --> 02:19:14,190
I gave you a wrapped one that was from 
the butcher.

3031
02:19:14,210 --> 02:19:15,680
What was it?
A roaster steak.

3032
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:17,770
Like a steak.
Do you remember what?

3033
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,020
See what is the,
there's a white,

3034
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:23,920
it's like film that they keep on 
sometimes to sort of retain moisture.

3035
02:19:23,921 --> 02:19:25,360
And when you,
when you see it,

3036
02:19:25,361 --> 02:19:29,120
it's like the Fascia on the outside of 
meat and you have to slice that off.

3037
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:31,220
It wasn't like a real visible thing.
Yeah,

3038
02:19:31,221 --> 02:19:34,450
it's really thin and sometimes it's in 
between the structure of the milestones,

3039
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:37,350
you've got to find it and cut it out or 
eat around it.

3040
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:40,100
It's just a different kind of animal.
The taste was good.

3041
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:41,230
Was just very.
Yeah,

3042
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:41,940
chew,
Chew.

3043
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:44,050
That's that part you've got to cut out.
That's all it is.

3044
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:46,460
Good though.
The ground.

3045
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:47,833
Oh yeah.
That's just like for burgers and Chili 

3046
02:19:50,151 --> 02:19:51,710
and all kinds of eggs in the morning.

3047
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:52,610
Oh,
it's fantastic.

3048
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:54,380
It's so good.
And again,

3049
02:19:54,381 --> 02:19:55,760
you don't have to worry about any 
bullshit.

3050
02:19:55,761 --> 02:19:59,510
It's no hormones by antibiotic.
That's the worst part.

3051
02:19:59,511 --> 02:20:00,344
Like it's an animal that lived wild.
I don't like the idea of just blindly 

3052
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:09,440
ordering meat like when I'm out because 
of not knowing where it came from or not

3053
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:11,450
knowing you know,
worse.

3054
02:20:11,451 --> 02:20:13,410
How about knowing?
Yeah.

3055
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:14,323
Even worse.
So you think about like what the animal 

3056
02:20:15,801 --> 02:20:16,940
was.
Yeah.

3057
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:17,870
No.
Yeah.

3058
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:18,893
Suffering.
We're in a weird place where we're 

3059
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:25,460
jammed into these boxes of people,
people,

3060
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:30,260
giant fucking populations and gotta get 
these people food and so they want.

3061
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:33,110
They don't want to know.
They don't know where it came from.

3062
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:34,210
No,
no.

3063
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:35,053
I know.
I think about how many people are 

3064
02:20:37,491 --> 02:20:40,790
looking for lunch every day.
I mean,

3065
02:20:40,791 --> 02:20:45,791
how do you feed this number of people 
that go to a Pastrami sandwich place?

3066
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:52,190
Get a fucking big corn beef with Swiss 
and mustard and you sitting there with a

3067
02:20:52,191 --> 02:20:54,770
friend eating at Jerry's Deli.
Have a great time.

3068
02:20:55,630 --> 02:20:56,670
Thank you.
Thank you.

3069
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,600
What the hell?
No thought whatsoever.

3070
02:20:59,601 --> 02:21:01,940
To the whole process of what makes corn 
beef.

3071
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:03,530
How do you get that?
Where'd that come from?

3072
02:21:03,550 --> 02:21:04,550
Where is that?
Yeah.

3073
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:07,520
No thought.
No thought at all.

3074
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:10,080
It's creepy,
you know,

3075
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:12,950
fucking weird man.
But what do you do?

3076
02:21:12,951 --> 02:21:15,440
There's so many of us do,
can't do anything,

3077
02:21:15,441 --> 02:21:17,750
like there's no way you can obviously do
something,

3078
02:21:17,751 --> 02:21:20,660
but I'm saying like the situation that 
we're in right now,

3079
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:21,523
it has to be resolved,
but it can't be resolved instantly 

3080
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:29,500
because to try to get all these people,
some sort of ethically raised animals,

3081
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:31,053
um,
pasture fed animals that aren't forced 

3082
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:36,890
to eat some shit they're not supposed to
eat.

3083
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:40,790
So they're unhealthy to get your 
vegetables all free of pesticides,

3084
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:42,530
but also high yield.

3085
02:21:42,570 --> 02:21:43,403
You protect them from insects and pasts 
and bullshit and disease and don't you 

3086
02:21:48,921 --> 02:21:51,860
feel like it's going to have to be like 
there's this new,

3087
02:21:51,861 --> 02:21:54,240
I think it's called better burger,
but that's like a,

3088
02:21:54,410 --> 02:21:55,880
a plant based Burger.
Yeah.

3089
02:21:55,890 --> 02:21:58,820
That,
that almost looks like it's bleeding.

3090
02:21:58,821 --> 02:22:00,230
Like it actually has like a,
like,

3091
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:01,910
have you tried it?
I haven't tried it yet,

3092
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:04,670
but people are really.
Have been talking about it a lot lately.

3093
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:06,430
Don't confuse,
um,

3094
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:11,690
farm raised plants with not having any 
consequences though.

3095
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:12,643
That's another problem that people have 
when they look at grain in particular 

3096
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:16,783
and they look at this,
the idea of like grain being completely 

3097
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:19,424
ethical.
I'm not saying don't eat grain was 

3098
02:22:21,350 --> 02:22:25,320
saying if you look at those gigantic 
combines that chew up all that grain,

3099
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:29,160
when you go over those fields,
after they'd been freshly cut,

3100
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:30,413
you see vultures all over circling 
because there's a ton of fucking things 

3101
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:34,944
that got killed and those blades,
rodents and rodents and rabbits and all 

3102
02:22:39,421 --> 02:22:40,110
kinds of shit.

3103
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:41,850
Occasionally Fonz,
you know,

3104
02:22:41,851 --> 02:22:46,300
if someone fucks up and rick's Fonz 
apparently will,

3105
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:48,240
when they're scared,
when they're really young,

3106
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:49,074
they just stay put.
They're scared and they get run over by 

3107
02:22:51,061 --> 02:22:51,894
shit,
but how are you going to feed 7 billion 

3108
02:22:53,551 --> 02:22:55,680
people that don't feel like you know.
Here's the key.

3109
02:22:55,681 --> 02:22:59,130
Here's the key man.
Preservatives without preservatives,

3110
02:22:59,131 --> 02:23:01,260
like everybody wants everything to be 
natural and organic.

3111
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:03,360
It's totally true,
but without preservatives,

3112
02:23:03,361 --> 02:23:04,194
it's very difficult to get supplies of 
shit and stockpile things and to have 

3113
02:23:07,801 --> 02:23:09,600
things in surplus.
I mean,

3114
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:14,010
other than grains,
beans and canned things,

3115
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,470
you know,
you'd have to catch everything,

3116
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:20,670
but a lot of shipping and how we move 
stuff around,

3117
02:23:20,671 --> 02:23:24,860
how long we want stuff to sit on the 
shelves and stuff to stay fresh and want

3118
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:28,260
to avoid mold by putting stuff into the 
voids mold.

3119
02:23:28,470 --> 02:23:33,470
It also fucks with the natural gut flora
that we have right in our seat.

3120
02:23:33,790 --> 02:23:38,280
I'm like a scientist.
You're with this repeating shit I read,

3121
02:23:38,281 --> 02:23:43,281
but isn't it crazy how passionate people
like I talked about that I was a eight,

3122
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:48,510
like a Vegan for a couple of years on my
podcast.

3123
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:54,920
We got more hate comments like people 
are so,

3124
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:57,780
uh,
like,

3125
02:23:58,190 --> 02:24:01,460
like passionate,
like screw you eating that way.

3126
02:24:01,461 --> 02:24:02,294
What do you mean?
I,

3127
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:03,153
I always eating that way.
I wasn't saying you have to eat that 

3128
02:24:05,121 --> 02:24:09,110
way,
but there is an anger if you

3129
02:24:09,450 --> 02:24:12,420
show them a different way of living or 
eating,

3130
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:14,010
eating,
just eating.

3131
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:14,903
Well,
they look at you as a person who's 

3132
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,050
responsible for the death and suffering 
of animals,

3133
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:21,000
right?
Yeah.

3134
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:22,920
That's what it is.
Right?

3135
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:23,913
And they wanted to show that they are in
a better moral position and they feel 

3136
02:24:27,641 --> 02:24:32,170
genuinely outraged by your eating meat.
But it's the other side too.

3137
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:36,370
If you say that you eat like a Vegan,
mediators come at you and say,

3138
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:38,050
who the hell do you think you are?
Yeah.

3139
02:24:38,170 --> 02:24:39,003
Oh,
you're good bro.

3140
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:42,310
How long have you been eating dirks?
Isn't it weird?

3141
02:24:42,490 --> 02:24:43,271
That is weird.
Like,

3142
02:24:43,271 --> 02:24:46,120
well who do you care what it is?
It doesn't make any sense.

3143
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:47,523
The mediator ragging on the Vegan to me 
doesn't make any sense at all unless 

3144
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,510
it's just like you ever meet a woman 
that is just so mad at men because she's

3145
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:58,860
ran into a few fucked up man.
You can't even talk to them.

3146
02:24:59,160 --> 02:24:59,993
Right?
Yeah.

3147
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:03,330
People just trying to be nice to.
You won't let that happen.

3148
02:25:03,610 --> 02:25:04,690
Like every man.
His Shit.

3149
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:06,190
Right.
That's sort of like.

3150
02:25:06,191 --> 02:25:10,210
I feel like maybe some meat eaters that 
shit on Vegans,

3151
02:25:10,570 --> 02:25:13,600
they get mad because vegans are so 
proselytizing.

3152
02:25:13,601 --> 02:25:17,830
It's such a common thing to be a 
proselytizing vegans that mediators like

3153
02:25:17,831 --> 02:25:20,590
almost like attack first first.
Right?

3154
02:25:20,591 --> 02:25:21,311
You know?
Yeah.

3155
02:25:21,311 --> 02:25:22,144
Like screw you.
You're not going to make me feel bad 

3156
02:25:22,871 --> 02:25:23,620
about.
I do.

3157
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,010
Yeah,
but

3158
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:27,700
then there's also,
there's a legit thought point that could

3159
02:25:27,701 --> 02:25:32,590
be made that the people that are a lot 
of the people maybe that are shitting on

3160
02:25:32,591 --> 02:25:35,440
vegans and veganism,
they're doing so because they don't want

3161
02:25:35,441 --> 02:25:40,390
to address their own complicity in the 
suffering of animals and they don't want

3162
02:25:40,391 --> 02:25:41,920
to think about it.
You make me think about it.

3163
02:25:41,921 --> 02:25:46,920
I just want to go to Carl's Jr Bacon and
Jalapeno Cheddar thing with.

3164
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:49,030
Yeah,
there's that too.

3165
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:50,380
Yeah.
You can't deny.

3166
02:25:50,570 --> 02:25:51,550
Yeah,
and it's not.

3167
02:25:51,730 --> 02:25:54,010
There's no absolute.
It's not one or the other.

3168
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:57,100
It's very possible that there's a bunch 
of shit going on.

3169
02:25:57,190 --> 02:26:02,190
Yeah,
but that the idea that you could get mad

3170
02:26:02,621 --> 02:26:05,110
at someone for eating Vegan,
that seems crazy.

3171
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:07,930
It does increase,
but I think that people are so connected

3172
02:26:07,931 --> 02:26:11,170
to what they eat that it.
It brings up this.

3173
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:12,850
It's a team thing.
Yeah.

3174
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:13,240
Right.

3175
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:15,440
It's like we were talking about a lot of
along the same.

3176
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:20,440
How many God damn vegans out there have 
the word Vegan and their twitter profile

3177
02:26:20,441 --> 02:26:22,690
or their facebook profile or their 
instagram.

3178
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:25,240
Jesus fucking Christ,
right?

3179
02:26:25,241 --> 02:26:29,080
You're wearing it like a badge of honor 
and they feel like they're going to help

3180
02:26:29,081 --> 02:26:31,570
the world with this whole plant based 
plant based,

3181
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:35,750
but if you wrote like mediator Tom,
Papa mediator on the,

3182
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:40,080
you know,
unless you run a TV show like Midi,

3183
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:42,850
there was Steve Sportsmen's outdoor 
channel.

3184
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,830
Unless you're doing that.
Yeah,

3185
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:47,700
you would never do that,
right?

3186
02:26:47,950 --> 02:26:49,660
You could write plant based,
you know like,

3187
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:50,503
Hey,
plant based and plant based and people 

3188
02:26:52,301 --> 02:26:54,370
write that in their profile.
It's not Vegan.

3189
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:57,340
Happy Vegan,
healthy Vegan,

3190
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:00,190
Vegan.
I want you to know what I am,

3191
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:02,560
what I stand for.
Athletic Vegan,

3192
02:27:02,590 --> 02:27:05,470
like there's so many people that have 
that in their name profile.

3193
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:09,100
It's so obvious what you're doing mean.
Some of them.

3194
02:27:09,150 --> 02:27:09,983
I just want to be part of a team.
I just want to be more of a healthy 

3195
02:27:11,681 --> 02:27:12,514
lifestyle.
I'm promoting the what's gonna Save the 

3196
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:17,010
world and promoting and I know they 
believe that [inaudible].

3197
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:21,460
I know they believe that,
but I think we tend to look at.

3198
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:23,530
She liked the entire thing,
right?

3199
02:27:23,531 --> 02:27:27,100
We tend to look at the entire group of 
people like we have to stop eating meat,

3200
02:27:27,130 --> 02:27:28,600
look at what we're doing to the 
environment.

3201
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:32,890
Yeah,
well some of us definitely don't have to

3202
02:27:32,891 --> 02:27:33,724
eat meat.
You can do whatever you want and we 

3203
02:27:35,351 --> 02:27:38,080
should all look at factory farming and 
say,

3204
02:27:38,081 --> 02:27:42,700
this is despicable and this is horrific 
that we've allowed our,

3205
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:45,110
our civilization to accept this.
Yeah.

3206
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:46,690
In our inside of our borders.
Right?

3207
02:27:46,950 --> 02:27:47,783
That this is a barbaric practice is 
terrifying because it's a complete 

3208
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:56,260
denial of like the natural order of 
life.

3209
02:27:56,261 --> 02:27:56,921
Instead you're like,
no,

3210
02:27:56,921 --> 02:28:00,520
I'm might just capture this life a cage 
it up and then shoot it when it's ready.

3211
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:01,590
Yeah.
Ooh.

3212
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:05,560
That way it stays tender because it 
doesn't move like this dark.

3213
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:06,880
Yeah.
To me,

3214
02:28:07,510 --> 02:28:10,600
what makes sense to me and everybody has
her own thoughts on this,

3215
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:11,863
it makes sense to me is to just go out 
in the wild and get it yourself if you 

3216
02:28:16,421 --> 02:28:17,350
can.
Yeah.

3217
02:28:17,650 --> 02:28:20,230
Everybody can't know.
I know people don't have the time.

3218
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,740
Right.
And I that too.

3219
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:22,160
Yeah,

3220
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:22,850
I get that.
I don't.

3221
02:28:22,850 --> 02:28:24,890
I'm not telling anybody what to do,
but for me,

3222
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,473
I was at a point in 2012 where I was 
trying to decide if I was going to be a 

3223
02:28:29,001 --> 02:28:29,834
Vegan or vegetarian.
I would lean towards vegetarian because 

3224
02:28:32,781 --> 02:28:33,614
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with free range eggs and things along 

3225
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:36,134
those lines and I don't think there's 
anything wrong with catching fish 

3226
02:28:37,941 --> 02:28:39,680
either,
so maybe it'd be like a pescatarian,

3227
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:44,030
but what I wanted to avoid was the whole
factory farming thing is fucked up.

3228
02:28:44,090 --> 02:28:46,430
It is completely.
So then I started hunting.

3229
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:47,930
I was like,
it's going to be one or the other.

3230
02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:49,310
Once I started hunting,
I was like,

3231
02:28:49,370 --> 02:28:51,350
oh,
this is the way because this is exciting

3232
02:28:51,351 --> 02:28:52,184
and crazy and wild and it puts you in 
tune with nature and this crazy way and 

3233
02:28:55,071 --> 02:28:55,904
you have this deep,
intense respect for wild things that I 

3234
02:28:58,131 --> 02:28:58,760
never had before.

3235
02:28:58,760 --> 02:28:59,593
I didn't think about the management of 
wildlife or the resources of the land 

3236
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:08,180
that we have public land and that these 
animals roam these areas and these areas

3237
02:29:08,181 --> 02:29:09,014
have to be supported with money and that
money comes from hunting tags and 

3238
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:14,250
attacks.
On sportsmen,

3239
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:17,000
skier and sporting gear and you know,
anything,

3240
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:19,880
hunting gear related,
they pay a giant.

3241
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:22,340
Some of that money that goes towards 
conservation.

3242
02:29:22,341 --> 02:29:24,500
It's a big tax.
He's like 11 percent.

3243
02:29:24,530 --> 02:29:25,363
Well yeah.
So this is like what supports that and 

3244
02:29:28,191 --> 02:29:29,024
all the licenses and everything that 
supports the fish and wildlife 

3245
02:29:32,270 --> 02:29:35,120
management of this country or this wild 
game.

3246
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:36,313
It pretend that's why there's more deer 
in this country than there has been 

3247
02:29:38,571 --> 02:29:41,270
since Columbus landed because more dear 
in this country.

3248
02:29:41,271 --> 02:29:43,400
Then when Columbus land,
it's not true.

3249
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:44,293
Yes,
it is more white tailed deer in this 

3250
02:29:45,771 --> 02:29:50,180
country than then there ever was before 
and then there's other animals that they

3251
02:29:50,181 --> 02:29:51,014
had almost extirpated because of what,
what are call market killing and market 

3252
02:29:55,221 --> 02:29:55,550
hunting.

3253
02:29:55,550 --> 02:29:56,383
They used to do at the turn of the 
century back when they didn't have 

3254
02:29:58,250 --> 02:29:59,083
refrigerators,
they would and they just took advantage 

3255
02:30:01,521 --> 02:30:04,700
of these wild animals roaming around.
They would hire assassins essentially to

3256
02:30:04,701 --> 02:30:07,210
go shoot these animals and sell,
sell the meat,

3257
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:10,700
and they almost wiped out all the elk.
They almost wiped out all the deer.

3258
02:30:10,701 --> 02:30:11,534
They almost wiped out everything at one 
point in time before fish and wildlife 

3259
02:30:14,781 --> 02:30:16,970
management company started managing all 
this stuff.

3260
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:22,540
There was a severe problem with the lack
of wildlife and the,

3261
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:23,673
you know,
the possible impending instead 

3262
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:26,263
extinction price crisis,
but since then they've repopulated elk 

3263
02:30:29,391 --> 02:30:30,224
and a lot of areas.
They repopulated dear almost everywhere 

3264
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:33,523
it was before.
There's a big family in New Jersey and 

3265
02:30:36,801 --> 02:30:37,634
they're deer all over the place and I 
always thought it was because there was 

3266
02:30:40,911 --> 02:30:43,520
so much development that the deer have 
nowhere to go.

3267
02:30:43,630 --> 02:30:45,050
Well,
it's because there's no predators,

3268
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:46,203
right.
In New Jersey has more predators now 

3269
02:30:47,061 --> 02:30:47,894
than ever before.
It was really New Jersey densest 

3270
02:30:49,521 --> 02:30:51,410
population of black bears in the 
country.

3271
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:52,820
Really?
Yeah.

3272
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:53,693
Yeah.
So those are the predators that control 

3273
02:30:54,801 --> 02:30:55,634
the deer population,
but a lot of times that's not enough 

3274
02:30:57,951 --> 02:31:00,440
food for them.
And then the encroaching population,

3275
02:31:00,441 --> 02:31:01,274
they find out about garbage cans and 
things like that and then they become a 

3276
02:31:03,651 --> 02:31:05,210
giant problem.
Right.

3277
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:08,330
Because there's also the densest 
populated with humans.

3278
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:09,710
Well it is,
but it's not.

3279
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:10,573
See,
New Jersey has a lot of really rural 

3280
02:31:11,841 --> 02:31:13,840
areas that a lot of people aren't really
thinking about.

3281
02:31:13,860 --> 02:31:16,670
They're not aware.
There's a ton of wildlife in New Jersey.

3282
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:20,040
People only think about like Newark,
which is where

3283
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,940
I was born.
Yeah.

3284
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:22,920
You know,
they think of northern New York,

3285
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:25,253
New Jersey rather than clerking county.
That's where I was born in southern New 

3286
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:30,730
Jersey and then last the whole best 
sell.

3287
02:31:30,731 --> 02:31:31,800
Fucking crazy.
Yeah,

3288
02:31:31,890 --> 02:31:33,940
it's crazy rural out there.
My,

3289
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:35,313
my brother in law started to.
Similar to what you started thinking 

3290
02:31:38,581 --> 02:31:39,414
about how he's going to get us food and 
stuff and he started hunting deer and 

3291
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:45,030
because it's in New Jersey,
there's all these deer,

3292
02:31:45,031 --> 02:31:45,864
so he goes out,
he gets to a season and it feeds his 

3293
02:31:49,681 --> 02:31:51,090
family for the year.
Yeah,

3294
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:53,750
and amazing.
It is a thought.

3295
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:54,593
First of all,
you're controlling a population that 

3296
02:31:55,351 --> 02:31:57,420
needs to be controlled because there's a
ton of accidents.

3297
02:31:57,630 --> 02:31:59,820
2 million car accidents in this country 
last year,

3298
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:04,760
people hitting deer and 150 people died.
2 million from hitting deer.

3299
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:05,970
Yeah.
In this country alone,

3300
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:07,030
she's.
Yeah,

3301
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:08,123
that's crazy high.
Unless you want to bring mountain lions 

3302
02:32:09,661 --> 02:32:10,494
and wolves everywhere,
you have to figure out a way to control 

3303
02:32:11,731 --> 02:32:13,740
those things,
but one of the best ways to control that

3304
02:32:13,741 --> 02:32:18,741
also contributes to wildlife management 
funds is hunting rifle hunting tags.

3305
02:32:19,330 --> 02:32:20,163
See,
it's all.

3306
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:21,063
It's all very counterintuitive because 
we assume the people who don't like 

3307
02:32:23,371 --> 02:32:24,160
wildlife,
right?

3308
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:24,993
Oh,
you don't like it if you'd like total 

3309
02:32:25,381 --> 02:32:26,910
out alone and let it.
Let it,

3310
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:28,680
let it live.
It's life man.

3311
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:32,070
But yeah,
but the problem is we've set up highways

3312
02:32:32,071 --> 02:32:34,530
and these cities and like you can't just
leave it alone.

3313
02:32:34,531 --> 02:32:35,364
Now.
We've already interfered in nature to a 

3314
02:32:36,711 --> 02:32:40,050
point.
We've altered gigantic swaths of land to

3315
02:32:40,051 --> 02:32:40,884
suit our bidding.
So you either want to regress away from 

3316
02:32:43,261 --> 02:32:44,094
technological.
So the people that drive tesla saying 

3317
02:32:45,991 --> 02:32:47,180
this are the most crazy.
What?

3318
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:49,013
Oh,
sorry.

3319
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,890
You know what I mean?
It's like people who want cities and one

3320
02:32:52,891 --> 02:32:53,724
technology,
but they don't want management of 

3321
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:55,450
wildlife.
You don't understand it.

3322
02:32:55,451 --> 02:32:57,570
They don't even understand it.
They've been out there.

3323
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,880
The city's not even possible unless you 
manage wildlife.

3324
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:00,733
Right?
Because of mountain lions and bears 

3325
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:05,910
start moving into Pasadena and start 
killing people to manage them.

3326
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:08,310
If deers are everywhere and everyone's 
crashing into cars,

3327
02:33:08,460 --> 02:33:09,630
you can imagine.
What are you going to do?

3328
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:11,600
How are you going to manage them?
It will.

3329
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:14,400
Human shouldn't play God man.
Okay.

3330
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:17,340
We'll just go outside and hope.
Hope you don't get eaten,

3331
02:33:17,380 --> 02:33:18,930
you know,
per se.

3332
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:21,600
I would say a high percentage without 
knowing anything,

3333
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:23,550
uh,
of people at hunt.

3334
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:26,130
Love the outdoors.
Love being out there.

3335
02:33:26,131 --> 02:33:26,964
But then you have those stories like you
were saying with the Ted nugent where 

3336
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:29,573
people just kinda come in with their 
guns and shoot and get drunk and go off 

3337
02:33:33,050 --> 02:33:33,920
those,
those,

3338
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:35,670
Frankie's,
he doesn't do that.

3339
02:33:35,671 --> 02:33:38,070
But he is a very boisterous right wing 
type character.

3340
02:33:38,071 --> 02:33:39,990
No,
I'm seeing the guys who came in and just

3341
02:33:39,991 --> 02:33:41,860
shot his books and split those guys.
We,

3342
02:33:41,861 --> 02:33:42,270
yeah,
yeah,

3343
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:43,103
yeah.
I don't know if they were drunk or just 

3344
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,160
crazy or drunk.
Okay.

3345
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:46,980
They were all cracked up and messed up.
Yeah.

3346
02:33:46,981 --> 02:33:50,850
They weren't crank around killing 
bathtub crank.

3347
02:33:51,150 --> 02:33:51,780
Well,
I hope this,

3348
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:54,000
this discussion doesn't dissuade you 
from going to Musso.

3349
02:33:54,001 --> 02:33:54,834
And frank's gentleman in our sue has to 
do what we've gotta do a Martini and a 

3350
02:33:58,651 --> 02:34:00,140
steak once a year.
All those,

3351
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:02,310
those cows once a year.
Um,

3352
02:34:02,500 --> 02:34:03,333
but this,
this meat that I eat last night that I 

3353
02:34:04,891 --> 02:34:07,560
shot yesterday morning and ate that 
night,

3354
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:10,410
maybe the best thing I've ever eaten in 
my life.

3355
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:13,470
Really fucking picture on instagram.
That one.

3356
02:34:14,830 --> 02:34:17,860
So rich with nutrients.
Just looking at those pictures.

3357
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,320
It's so.
It's so good.

3358
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:23,080
My God.
It's so rich with nutrients.

3359
02:34:23,081 --> 02:34:25,540
So how did you cook that?
I cooked it on.

3360
02:34:25,541 --> 02:34:27,790
I have a pellet grill.
It's called a yoder.

3361
02:34:27,810 --> 02:34:30,100
It was a bunch of really good ones.
Trager makes it a really good one.

3362
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:32,470
Green mountain grills makes really good 
ones.

3363
02:34:32,471 --> 02:34:33,304
A bunch of companies that make them.
I cook it at 275 degrees until it hits 

3364
02:34:37,721 --> 02:34:42,100
an internal temperature of 125 degrees.
Then it's not so long,

3365
02:34:42,101 --> 02:34:42,760
right?
No.

3366
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:45,940
Then I take it off and then I heat up a 
cast iron skillet.

3367
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:48,190
This is.
I've tried a bunch of different ways,

3368
02:34:48,220 --> 02:34:51,280
but this is the method that works the 
best for me that I liked the best.

3369
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,353
I heat a cast iron skillet very,
very hot and then I put some grass fed 

3370
02:34:56,260 --> 02:35:00,250
butter in a cast iron skillet and then I
see or the outside of put across.

3371
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:03,250
So after the internal temperature is 
already 125 degrees.

3372
02:35:03,251 --> 02:35:05,920
I cook it real quick.
So last in?

3373
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:08,440
Yep.
Into the pan which is on the stove top.

3374
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:13,720
Yeah,
like maybe less than a minute.

3375
02:35:13,721 --> 02:35:15,820
Each side maybe?
Yeah,

3376
02:35:15,821 --> 02:35:16,654
like maybe like 45 seconds,
maybe each side just to get a little 

3377
02:35:19,841 --> 02:35:20,674
crust on that and it just is the perfect
combination of the outside and the 

3378
02:35:24,191 --> 02:35:27,310
inside is very rare.
Light but warm.

3379
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:29,743
It's like when you take a bite of me,
just start pounding the table and it 

3380
02:35:32,591 --> 02:35:35,470
makes you feel physically good.
Yeah.

3381
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:36,363
Not like Ligo.
Google your big mirror and killed an 

3382
02:35:38,001 --> 02:35:39,090
animal.
That's not what I mean.

3383
02:35:39,091 --> 02:35:44,080
I mean like your body responds to the 
nutrients and the meat in almost like an

3384
02:35:44,081 --> 02:35:44,914
instantaneous way and part of it could 
be the thing that's very different than 

3385
02:35:48,191 --> 02:35:49,024
going to Jerry's Deli and getting that,
but stromae is that there's an 

3386
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:56,530
incredible deep,
immediate connection with that food,

3387
02:35:56,800 --> 02:36:01,420
especially for me that day,
knowing that I shot that that morning.

3388
02:36:01,810 --> 02:36:03,990
How did you get it done?
So it doesn't have to go to the butcher?

3389
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:06,130
No,
we take parts of the body off,

3390
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:09,550
take the backstraps and the tenderloins,
which are like,

3391
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:12,940
I'm very easy to manage.
Cuts a butcher shop.

3392
02:36:12,941 --> 02:36:13,774
We'll cut steaks out of the back legs 
and the Hams and roasts and things like 

3393
02:36:17,621 --> 02:36:18,490
that.
Gotcha.

3394
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:19,533
So what did you,
what,

3395
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:21,120
what was that piece that you had last 
night?

3396
02:36:21,130 --> 02:36:23,110
Was the tenderloin that you just took 
with you?

3397
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:23,891
Yeah,
well,

3398
02:36:23,891 --> 02:36:26,800
I took a bunch of it with me.
Just put it in a cooler,

3399
02:36:26,801 --> 02:36:30,070
a Yeti cooler.
But dude,

3400
02:36:30,071 --> 02:36:31,150
it's a,
it's,

3401
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:35,110
it's the total opposite of going to a 
burger place where you just go,

3402
02:36:35,111 --> 02:36:36,280
yeah.
Can I get a double double?

3403
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:37,420
Yeah.
Onions,

3404
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:39,730
fries,
a large diet coke to please.

3405
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,500
Right,
you get that and it's great.

3406
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:42,850
I mean it tastes good and everything 
like that,

3407
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:44,890
but that's,
there's no connection,

3408
02:36:44,891 --> 02:36:45,370
nothing.

3409
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:46,203
Whereas there's no thought.
It's insane connection and it's really 

3410
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:52,360
difficult to accomplish,
to shoot an elk with a bone arrow.

3411
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:54,730
It's crazy.
It takes years and years of practice and

3412
02:36:54,731 --> 02:36:55,564
I still suck at it compared to like a 
really good archer and a really good 

3413
02:36:58,301 --> 02:37:00,700
hunter.
I'm still constantly practicing,

3414
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:03,380
constantly trying to,
uh,

3415
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:04,870
no.
I mean evolve it.

3416
02:37:05,470 --> 02:37:07,660
Like if I were to get into hunting and 
go out there,

3417
02:37:07,661 --> 02:37:11,200
I'd have to take a gun because otherwise
I'm going to be shooting it in.

3418
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:14,470
It's even that you have to learn how to 
shoot a gun properly.

3419
02:37:14,471 --> 02:37:15,440
The snotty,
it's not.

3420
02:37:15,470 --> 02:37:16,310
People think it's easy

3421
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:19,040
to go shoot an animal with a gun getting
close to one.

3422
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:20,510
If you don't know what the fuck you're 
doing,

3423
02:37:20,511 --> 02:37:25,040
you could look out and wander into a 
deer is not paying attention to them,

3424
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:26,990
but most of the time,
no.

3425
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:30,380
Most of the time you have to get within 
a couple of hundred yards of them.

3426
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:32,360
You have to.
If the wind is wrong,

3427
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:35,570
they smell you a mile away,
they fucking bolt immediately.

3428
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:37,153
We stink doing.
We smelled terrible when animals smell 

3429
02:37:40,401 --> 02:37:41,420
us.
I don't know.

3430
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:42,323
I would.
I would wish science could figure out 

3431
02:37:44,361 --> 02:37:48,950
what it is that hits an animal's 
nostrils when they smell a person,

3432
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:50,720
but like a deer.
They're like,

3433
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,820
fuck this.
They're gone.

3434
02:37:52,850 --> 02:37:53,390
Really?
Yeah.

3435
02:37:53,390 --> 02:37:57,020
The wind hits the back of your neck.
See if your winds change.

3436
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:58,023
Right?
So like say if you're looking at these 

3437
02:37:58,731 --> 02:37:59,564
animals and you're trying to make a 
stock on one and then the wind is 

3438
02:38:02,751 --> 02:38:04,940
blowing in your face,
like this is perfect.

3439
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:07,070
They can't smell me because the wind's 
in my face.

3440
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:09,920
Then as you get closer,
the wind can shift.

3441
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:13,580
Sometimes the wind swirls and you feel 
in the back of your neck and they just.

3442
02:38:13,581 --> 02:38:16,060
The animals perk up and they're like,
fuck right.

3443
02:38:16,190 --> 02:38:17,300
And they're gone.
Yeah.

3444
02:38:17,301 --> 02:38:18,134
It's amazing.
It's because they're thinking about 

3445
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:22,100
cats.
That's what they're thinking about.

3446
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:26,420
They're thinking about smelling a cat 
and that fucking that sent hits them.

3447
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:28,310
Yeah.
This weird human scent.

3448
02:38:28,510 --> 02:38:31,010
The human things bad too.
I think we probably smell.

3449
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:33,590
We'd probably have our own unique danger
smell,

3450
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:35,030
but they're,
I mean,

3451
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:38,210
they're,
the evolution is not to avoid humans.

3452
02:38:38,211 --> 02:38:39,770
We've only been here a couple of hundred
years.

3453
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:43,310
The evolution of the ELC is most likely 
to avoid predators.

3454
02:38:43,311 --> 02:38:47,390
Cats and bears that smell.
They smell a predator.

3455
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:48,800
Right?
Fuck this,

3456
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:52,100
you know,
go to the breath of a grizzly bear.

3457
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,613
No,
and the lane hits you if you're a 

3458
02:38:57,231 --> 02:38:58,880
fucking dear Jesus.

3459
02:38:58,940 --> 02:39:01,820
I saw coyote the other day out on my 
neighbor's lawn.

3460
02:39:01,821 --> 02:39:06,180
It was like a Husky.
It was a big ass look like a wolf.

3461
02:39:06,181 --> 02:39:08,540
It's probably a Coi Wolf on the other 
half.

3462
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:09,590
There's.
Those are happening.

3463
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:12,290
There's coyotes.
Well,

3464
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:13,153
here's the thing.
There was a guy named Dan Flores that I 

3465
02:39:14,721 --> 02:39:15,554
had on the podcast.
He wrote this book called Coyote 

3466
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:18,253
America.
Fascinating book with a history of 

3467
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:19,980
coyotes in America.
Oh yeah.

3468
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:21,800
Can absorb that book.
It's so good.

3469
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:23,660
Oh,
it's amazing because it's so crazy.

3470
02:39:23,661 --> 02:39:25,310
I know.
There's all the shit that I did know.

3471
02:39:25,550 --> 02:39:27,530
One of the things is that a coyote is a 
wolf.

3472
02:39:28,070 --> 02:39:31,070
It is a small wolf.
It's a small species of walking.

3473
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:34,970
That's why they interbreed with walls.
No problem.

3474
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:36,373
Every wolf except the gray wolf,
the gray wolf left America for so long 

3475
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:40,993
and went to Africa and became like 
jackals and all these different dog 

3476
02:39:44,811 --> 02:39:47,060
species over there,
but all the dogs that we have,

3477
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:48,560
all of them came from wolves.

3478
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:50,720
All of them and all of our dogs,
my dogs,

3479
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:53,150
every dog.
And they all can breed with a wolf.

3480
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:54,620
Really?
All of them.

3481
02:39:54,730 --> 02:39:55,461
Yeah.
So.

3482
02:39:55,461 --> 02:39:58,530
And the coyotes,
they breed with different,

3483
02:39:58,531 --> 02:40:00,890
like a lot of coyotes.
Like what percentage?

3484
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:02,210
Grey Wolf.
What percentage?

3485
02:40:02,211 --> 02:40:03,920
Red Wolf.
Like there's separate species.

3486
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:07,730
They're all the same thing genetically.
Like every dog,

3487
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:10,070
when they traced the DNA of a dog that 
give,

3488
02:40:10,130 --> 02:40:12,390
give all of them come from wolves.
Real.

3489
02:40:12,391 --> 02:40:14,430
Yeah.
One of my little black lab.

3490
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:16,110
The Coi Wolf?
Yeah.

3491
02:40:16,111 --> 02:40:18,540
You're a little black lab at one point,
you know?

3492
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:23,541
Who knows what that process was a wolf.
So these coils,

3493
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:26,530
you see the one in the black,
that's the Coi Wolf,

3494
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:31,760
but it's like a combination of like a 
wolf and a coyote that play.

3495
02:40:31,831 --> 02:40:33,870
Meanwhile,
even coyotes though,

3496
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:36,630
this Guy Dan Flores,
we're saying are kind of wolf.

3497
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:37,553
That's why it works in the first place 
because they don't like if something 

3498
02:40:40,501 --> 02:40:43,560
like a Tiger Fox align and they make a 
lagger,

3499
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:44,693
that lagger can have babies,
but because they're two totally 

3500
02:40:47,461 --> 02:40:48,294
different species,
but at tiger can fuck a lion and get it 

3501
02:40:50,821 --> 02:40:51,654
pregnant.

3502
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:53,220
There's a real legacy.
It's about it.

3503
02:40:53,221 --> 02:40:58,221
Talk to you worried.
This was not the woods for you.

3504
02:40:58,590 --> 02:41:00,240
Uh,
it wouldn't go out of here,

3505
02:41:00,241 --> 02:41:01,074
buddy.
Let me get you back home to your 

3506
02:41:01,861 --> 02:41:03,810
parents.
Not here comes a bear.

3507
02:41:05,270 --> 02:41:07,980
I'm protecting these kids.
You fuck dude.

3508
02:41:07,981 --> 02:41:11,220
You smell.
You smell terrible.

3509
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:14,850
Get outta here.
So what you've seen is larger coyote.

3510
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:17,400
This was a big coyote.
It was big.

3511
02:41:17,401 --> 02:41:18,650
I was like,
oh my God.

3512
02:41:20,150 --> 02:41:23,970
He might just be a regular coyote.
That's big to a lot of food out here,

3513
02:41:23,971 --> 02:41:24,804
man.
Man.

3514
02:41:24,810 --> 02:41:27,780
Mostly pets.
It's a lot of pets of pets.

3515
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:29,420
A lot of bets,
man,

3516
02:41:29,421 --> 02:41:30,254
leave me.
We got light deal with coyotes as 

3517
02:41:31,771 --> 02:41:34,140
opposed to those people in New Jersey 
that are dealing with bears.

3518
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:35,393
Yeah.
People.

3519
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:38,460
People don't know.
People that live outside like go,

3520
02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:41,010
go to that video from far rockaway where
these two,

3521
02:41:41,011 --> 02:41:43,410
500 pound bear,
I might be exaggerating,

3522
02:41:43,710 --> 02:41:47,910
500 pound bears are rustling and 
fighting in the street,

3523
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:51,840
knocking over mailboxes in New Jersey 
and cars stopped there.

3524
02:41:51,850 --> 02:41:53,250
Their Internet,
if I'm exaggerating,

3525
02:41:53,251 --> 02:41:54,930
it's not by much.
Look at these two things.

3526
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:57,870
Oh man,
look at this size of these fuckers.

3527
02:41:57,871 --> 02:41:58,704
Dude looks like my sister's house.
But look how they fall down and they 

3528
02:42:01,541 --> 02:42:03,420
knock shit over.
They slammed me.

3529
02:42:03,421 --> 02:42:04,254
They knocked over that fence post.
Look at the size of these fuckers and 

3530
02:42:08,611 --> 02:42:11,550
they're fighting over territory.
They don't attack people though.

3531
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:12,930
Sure they do.
They do.

3532
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:14,130
Rockaway,
New Jersey.

3533
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:16,320
A kid in rutgers was killed a couple of 
years ago.

3534
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:21,740
A kid in Alaska was killed by a bear who
was on look them go to their big.

3535
02:42:21,820 --> 02:42:23,820
A kid in Alaska was killed.
He was on a,

3536
02:42:23,821 --> 02:42:24,750
uh,
a race.

3537
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:27,060
He was on a trail race.
Sixteen year old kid,

3538
02:42:27,061 --> 02:42:28,860
he called his mom,
said a bear was following them.

3539
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:31,080
Oh my God.
And got a bear.

3540
02:42:31,081 --> 02:42:31,700
Got Him.
They,

3541
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:33,870
they found the bear protecting the kids 
body.

3542
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:35,670
Look at the size of that fucker.

3543
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:37,620
That's huge.
I felt black bears were small.

3544
02:42:37,650 --> 02:42:39,360
No,
that's bullshit.

3545
02:42:39,470 --> 02:42:41,580
They're cute.
I thought they were small.

3546
02:42:41,850 --> 02:42:42,683
How small do you think they were?
I thought they were like a smaller than 

3547
02:42:45,691 --> 02:42:47,370
that.
With the size of that.

3548
02:42:47,430 --> 02:42:50,820
When they first are,
when they're babies grow it really big.

3549
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:52,650
The ones at the junk.
Bam.

3550
02:42:52,710 --> 02:42:54,840
They get huge man.
Huge.

3551
02:42:54,841 --> 02:42:57,000
They get to be like eight feet tall.
She's.

3552
02:42:57,001 --> 02:42:57,834
Yeah.
So what's the Predator for the black 

3553
02:42:58,561 --> 02:43:01,520
bear and New Jersey hunters.
That's it.

3554
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:03,840
That's it bears on.
How many predators?

3555
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:04,740
None.
Well,

3556
02:43:04,741 --> 02:43:06,810
the only Predator to a bears,
another bear,

3557
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:10,260
which they do kill each other a lot.
They eat each other a lot.

3558
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:12,010
Especially babies.

3559
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:14,320
They eat a lot of babies.
They do.

3560
02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:16,690
Oh yeah,
a lot of babies.

3561
02:43:17,570 --> 02:43:18,403
How would this guy.
He's riding his mountain bike and he 

3562
02:43:20,321 --> 02:43:22,120
sees that bear and fucking fall down.
I was like,

3563
02:43:22,150 --> 02:43:23,920
chooses.
We don't have them out here.

3564
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:26,503
Get this panic.
He ever seen the one where the guy hits 

3565
02:43:29,711 --> 02:43:31,690
the bear and his car and he fucking 
screamed.

3566
02:43:31,691 --> 02:43:33,360
Holy Fuck.
No.

3567
02:43:33,430 --> 02:43:34,263
He's driving his car down this road,
going like 35 miles an hour and this 

3568
02:43:36,521 --> 02:43:38,920
bear jumps out last minute.
Boom,

3569
02:43:38,921 --> 02:43:40,270
hits the sea,
hits the car,

3570
02:43:40,450 --> 02:43:43,960
and the bear goes.
Fall line runs off into the.

3571
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,550
Into the woods.
Oh my God.

3572
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:47,020
Probably died.
Yeah,

3573
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,600
but watch it slowly.
Watch this is crazy.

3574
02:43:49,601 --> 02:43:51,460
Yeah.
Watch this shit.

3575
02:43:51,461 --> 02:43:56,461
He's driving his car.
Just having a good time.

3576
02:43:57,410 --> 02:44:00,090
Yeah.
I am just driving.

3577
02:44:01,290 --> 02:44:06,290
Oh.
Oh my God.

3578
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:12,950
That's not even the one that's the daily
mail one.

3579
02:44:13,010 --> 02:44:14,420
And then ran into the woods.
Yeah.

3580
02:44:14,421 --> 02:44:16,610
There's another one that happens even 
quicker.

3581
02:44:16,611 --> 02:44:18,400
This is a little different because it's 
got a guard rail.

3582
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:19,253
The other one,
the other video is there's a bunch of 

3583
02:44:20,661 --> 02:44:21,860
trees to the side.
This is it.

3584
02:44:22,670 --> 02:44:23,451
Yeah.
North Carolina.

3585
02:44:23,451 --> 02:44:24,284
Watch this one who were just driving 
along and thinking about the time and 

3586
02:44:26,741 --> 02:44:29,020
why people used to run the world and 
slavery was Mike.

3587
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:31,280
God,
that thing's huge.

3588
02:44:32,190 --> 02:44:37,190
The Shit don't have a fucking bear.
I said the same thing again.

3589
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:42,120
Oh Man.
Oh my God.

3590
02:44:42,290 --> 02:44:43,123
That's insane.
I want to go home and smoke a fucking 

3591
02:44:52,660 --> 02:44:53,493
shit.
They couldn't be any better than if 

3592
02:44:56,140 --> 02:44:59,600
somebody narrated over an accident like 
that.

3593
02:44:59,601 --> 02:45:00,550
Oh,
it's terrible.

3594
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:02,440
Home Smoking.
Fucking big blow.

3595
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:05,780
He missed that part.
Oh my God.

3596
02:45:06,530 --> 02:45:09,050
That is scary.
I just hit a bear.

3597
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:11,630
They're huge dude.
My sister in law just hit a deer.

3598
02:45:11,631 --> 02:45:12,530
She says like,
like,

3599
02:45:12,531 --> 02:45:13,364
uh,
you know,

3600
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:17,570
Bergen County,
not a rural part.

3601
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:18,493
My friend Cam lives in Oregon and one of
the guys in his neighborhood died 

3602
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:22,423
because someone in front of him hit a 
deer and the deer went flying through 

3603
02:45:25,581 --> 02:45:28,370
the air and his car was behind it and 
the deer landed through his

3604
02:45:28,460 --> 02:45:30,580
windshield.
She,

3605
02:45:31,570 --> 02:45:34,670
it's just flying bone.
Here's,

3606
02:45:34,700 --> 02:45:37,340
here's the angry Vegan argument.
So you just went like,

3607
02:45:37,370 --> 02:45:38,203
oh,
these animals to go away so you can 

3608
02:45:39,291 --> 02:45:42,770
continue destroying the world with your 
stupid fucking car,

3609
02:45:42,771 --> 02:45:44,960
man.
Is that what you're saying?

3610
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:46,770
So yeah,
there shouldn't be any wildlife

3611
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:50,560
because they didn't convince you.
How about it's their land man?

3612
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:54,730
How about if there's.
Well then you shouldn't be talking to me

3613
02:45:54,731 --> 02:45:57,670
because there'd be no computers and 
their land.

3614
02:45:57,671 --> 02:46:01,660
You wouldn't survive either.
We carve off swaths of it for our own.

3615
02:46:01,661 --> 02:46:03,370
What we decide,
the cities or our nomad,

3616
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:04,373
the cities aren't even real man.
This is something we build over their 

3617
02:46:07,150 --> 02:46:10,100
sacred burial ground.
This is where the bears just

3618
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:14,030
buried a young man talk to each other in
an ancient language.

3619
02:46:14,031 --> 02:46:17,190
You don't understand anymore.
We cannot look.

3620
02:46:17,370 --> 02:46:19,460
We all have our own little fantasy world
is.

3621
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:22,340
Well,
the anthropomorphization that thing that

3622
02:46:22,341 --> 02:46:23,174
Disney movies did,
but they made animals talk that fuck 

3623
02:46:25,231 --> 02:46:27,710
people up.
It really did fuck this up as children.

3624
02:46:27,770 --> 02:46:29,270
I really did.
It really did.

3625
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:30,160
Yeah.
No,

3626
02:46:30,161 --> 02:46:31,310
I know.
I mean,

3627
02:46:31,460 --> 02:46:33,230
people think that's a joke.
I'm joking around.

3628
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:34,273
I'm being dead serious.
I watched my kids are vegetarians 

3629
02:46:36,830 --> 02:46:37,663
because my wife is was a big part of it 
was seeing them as people like seeing 

3630
02:46:45,171 --> 02:46:46,760
them with a little bow tie or like you 
know,

3631
02:46:46,870 --> 02:46:48,440
it.
It really has an effect.

3632
02:46:49,790 --> 02:46:52,010
Of course,
especially when you're a little baby,

3633
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:53,353
you know,
when you grow up watching Yogi bear 

3634
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:55,880
watching,
you know,

3635
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:59,370
foghorn Leghorn,
but as a child,

3636
02:46:59,450 --> 02:47:01,950
when I was watching that stuff,
my mom was awesome.

3637
02:47:01,950 --> 02:47:06,920
Making amazing meals at the same time.
Did not connect it.

3638
02:47:06,921 --> 02:47:10,730
Now yogi was Yogi and mom just made 
lasagna.

3639
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:13,550
There's a real problem with representing
something.

3640
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:14,451
I mean,
look,

3641
02:47:14,451 --> 02:47:16,130
it's entertaining.
It's nothing wrong with that.

3642
02:47:16,190 --> 02:47:21,080
For us as an adult child,
it puts the idea in your head that these

3643
02:47:21,081 --> 02:47:22,970
things are something other than what 
they are.

3644
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:24,110
Right.
You know,

3645
02:47:24,111 --> 02:47:26,420
not that there's anything bad with what 
they are,

3646
02:47:26,421 --> 02:47:28,550
what they are is amazing.
Even predators,

3647
02:47:28,551 --> 02:47:30,740
like I don't.
I wouldn't want predators wiped out.

3648
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:33,920
I think bears and wolves.
Fucking awesome man.

3649
02:47:33,921 --> 02:47:36,780
It's crazy to see too.
Oh no one around them.

3650
02:47:37,010 --> 02:47:37,870
Yeah,
and look,

3651
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:38,713
I mean,
that's why the factory farming thing is 

3652
02:47:40,071 --> 02:47:42,790
so gross.
There's a consciousness to animals.

3653
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:44,810
My Dog,
you know?

3654
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:47,930
Oh yeah.
It has a sensitivity and a love.

3655
02:47:48,090 --> 02:47:51,050
I mean,
is you make those animals suffer.

3656
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:52,940
I mean that.
That's exactly.

3657
02:47:53,050 --> 02:47:56,480
That's the other thing is that animals,
especially dogs,

3658
02:47:56,510 --> 02:47:57,343
they have developed this intense 
sensitivity in connection with people 

3659
02:47:59,541 --> 02:48:03,860
over thousands and thousands of years of
having this weird symbiotic relationship

3660
02:48:03,861 --> 02:48:05,360
with us to the point where you get like 
a,

3661
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:08,210
like I have a golden golden retriever 
do.

3662
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:10,340
This is the sweetest dog I've ever had 
in my life.

3663
02:48:10,580 --> 02:48:12,440
It was a big old snuggle bunny.
Yeah,

3664
02:48:12,470 --> 02:48:13,303
he's a baby and he's the sweetest thing.
Like occasionally he plays all little 

3665
02:48:16,761 --> 02:48:21,761
too rough and everybody gets mad at him,
but it's such a sweet love bucket.

3666
02:48:22,430 --> 02:48:24,050
Like when I come home,
that dog,

3667
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:24,913
he runs around me in circles,
then drops onto his back and I start 

3668
02:48:27,711 --> 02:48:29,120
rubbing his belly.
Yeah.

3669
02:48:29,121 --> 02:48:32,810
I sit down and he climbs on top of me 
and circles around and kisses my face,

3670
02:48:32,811 --> 02:48:35,960
licking like crazy with his legs up in 
the air.

3671
02:48:35,970 --> 02:48:36,680
He wants to be a rub.

3672
02:48:36,680 --> 02:48:38,450
His Tummy,
the past.

3673
02:48:38,451 --> 02:48:40,220
It's the past.
He's so sweet.

3674
02:48:40,221 --> 02:48:40,941
You know,
they did a,

3675
02:48:40,941 --> 02:48:42,230
uh,
there was an article the other day,

3676
02:48:42,231 --> 02:48:45,350
which I didn't get too deep into,
but that they,

3677
02:48:45,351 --> 02:48:46,690
um,
this guy,

3678
02:48:47,710 --> 02:48:49,640
um,
train dogs,

3679
02:48:49,641 --> 02:48:52,700
so they would be calm enough so you 
could put them in an MRI.

3680
02:48:52,701 --> 02:48:54,920
You could actually study their brains.
Oh Wow.

3681
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:58,220
It was hard to do because dogs like 
freak out and that,

3682
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:00,500
but you need them just to stay still 
like a human.

3683
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:01,633
So you can study their brain and they 
learned that a lot of the patterns of a 

3684
02:49:06,021 --> 02:49:11,021
dog's brain are similar to ours.
Empathy and feeling for things in motion

3685
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:12,340
of like,
you know,

3686
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:14,093
it was so similar that it really showed 
like just genetically wired to feel an 

3687
02:49:20,310 --> 02:49:23,070
and have emotion.
Very similar to the way we do.

3688
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:24,480
That's fascinating.
You know what else?

3689
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:26,940
So genetically wired to do kill 
chickens.

3690
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:29,340
Real problem.
Yeah.

3691
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:32,430
Do you have chicken?
I don't know if he's killed one,

3692
02:49:32,431 --> 02:49:35,400
but he definitely brought a dead one to 
me once when I was like,

3693
02:49:35,401 --> 02:49:37,860
did you kill this?
What the fuck happened?

3694
02:49:38,220 --> 02:49:40,110
Because it didn't make sense.
What do you mean?

3695
02:49:40,150 --> 02:49:40,983
Because he doesn't seem that aggressive 
with the chickens before it might've 

3696
02:49:44,031 --> 02:49:45,780
died.
Like they just die sometimes.

3697
02:49:45,781 --> 02:49:46,860
Sure.
They just die.

3698
02:49:46,861 --> 02:49:48,420
You find them in their pen?
Yeah.

3699
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:50,250
The chicken coop.
They have this big ass,

3700
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:51,473
like a chicken house.
Sometimes you just find them in their 

3701
02:49:52,861 --> 02:49:53,950
debt.
Oh yeah.

3702
02:49:54,290 --> 02:49:55,830
You know there's where you get all your 
eggs.

3703
02:49:55,860 --> 02:49:56,760
Yeah.
It's great.

3704
02:49:56,761 --> 02:49:57,930
They don't live that long,
you know?

3705
02:49:57,970 --> 02:49:59,670
But,
but he fucking,

3706
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:03,300
now that he's had one in his mouth,
has carried it around,

3707
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:04,443
found it.
Now he wants to go near them all the 

3708
02:50:05,761 --> 02:50:06,301
time.
Like,

3709
02:50:06,301 --> 02:50:08,430
hey,
cut the shit.

3710
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:11,160
Can you train them out to sort of.
Yeah.

3711
02:50:11,161 --> 02:50:12,510
But you got,
be on it all the time.

3712
02:50:12,530 --> 02:50:14,100
Yeah.
It's got to be like a daily thing.

3713
02:50:14,101 --> 02:50:16,880
Like he really likes chasing chickens.
Yeah.

3714
02:50:16,910 --> 02:50:17,880
He's like,
what are you talking about?

3715
02:50:17,881 --> 02:50:18,410
These are fucking

3716
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:19,890
chickens.
No,

3717
02:50:20,110 --> 02:50:25,110
these are back here.
Had this thing since it was a big chase.

3718
02:50:25,170 --> 02:50:29,100
Chickens in their system.
It's instinct of course.

3719
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:29,991
Oh yeah,
dude.

3720
02:50:29,991 --> 02:50:31,730
He's so happy too.
When you catch them doing it,

3721
02:50:31,731 --> 02:50:32,564
you know,
he just doesn't want to listen to my 

3722
02:50:36,621 --> 02:50:38,960
dog.
Like it's great black lab.

3723
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:41,210
She's so sweet.
Same thing.

3724
02:50:41,570 --> 02:50:43,300
And uh,
because we,

3725
02:50:43,400 --> 02:50:44,233
it's a vegetarian household,
it was only when I don't make meat that 

3726
02:50:48,261 --> 02:50:50,270
often when I'm with the family because 
it's just kind of,

3727
02:50:50,330 --> 02:50:51,163
you know,
it's kind of weird to be sitting there 

3728
02:50:51,651 --> 02:50:53,600
eating meat in front of them.
So,

3729
02:50:53,601 --> 02:50:55,460
uh,
but when I do,

3730
02:50:55,850 --> 02:51:00,620
when we're alone,
sometimes they're giving her some meat.

3731
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:01,933
She started to see me as the one thing 
in the house that gave me whatever that 

3732
02:51:04,971 --> 02:51:05,804
was.
Our relationship went to a whole nother 

3733
02:51:08,121 --> 02:51:08,954
level.
Yeah,

3734
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:10,640
yeah,
yeah.

3735
02:51:10,641 --> 02:51:13,430
Now she looks at me differently,
meet with butter on it.

3736
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:18,950
They don't even bother chewing it.
You ever seen when you give them onto so

3737
02:51:19,190 --> 02:51:21,070
fast,
it's so gone.

3738
02:51:21,071 --> 02:51:23,180
So I really feel like,
no,

3739
02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:26,000
I enjoy that.
If you give them dog food,

3740
02:51:26,001 --> 02:51:28,350
they never react like that.
Like Lee does.

3741
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:32,560
You're calling it chicken was chicken 
shit.

3742
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:35,870
I cut off a couple of peaks at ELC and 
put it in my dogs food.

3743
02:51:36,020 --> 02:51:41,020
They're looking for more of time on the 
bowl.

3744
02:51:41,361 --> 02:51:43,230
Under the bold.
She'd be gone.

3745
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:47,240
Take your time.
Good instincts.

3746
02:51:47,770 --> 02:51:48,800
Yeah,
it's us.

3747
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,390
It is a weird thing that we've created 
these animals.

3748
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:55,020
Not created them but sort of bred them 
to the point where they become a part of

3749
02:51:55,021 --> 02:51:57,930
the household and they live with you,
but they don't speak English.

3750
02:51:58,380 --> 02:52:00,020
No rules.
They know the rules.

3751
02:52:00,400 --> 02:52:01,500
I've been kill you,
but they don't

3752
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:04,750
when your dog sometimes like it's just 
like your face to face.

3753
02:52:04,751 --> 02:52:06,010
He was looking you in the face

3754
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:06,843
and you're just like,
and you just see the teeth and you're 

3755
02:52:08,540 --> 02:52:09,373
like,
this is kind of weird that I my face as 

3756
02:52:11,471 --> 02:52:12,304
close to this draw.
Thank God this thing is really nice 

3757
02:52:15,251 --> 02:52:17,320
because it could just bite me in the 
face right now.

3758
02:52:17,350 --> 02:52:18,183
That's why radic dogs like Cujo are so 
fucking terrifying because they're a 

3759
02:52:21,071 --> 02:52:21,904
part of your family.
Then all of a sudden something goes 

3760
02:52:23,231 --> 02:52:25,720
wrong.
I had a job when I was a kid that we got

3761
02:52:25,721 --> 02:52:26,554
from the pound and had this temper and 
we had them for a couple of days and it 

3762
02:52:29,291 --> 02:52:31,270
just.
It kept getting worse and worse.

3763
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:33,760
It was a Doberman Doberman Pinch.
Oh my God.

3764
02:52:33,761 --> 02:52:37,260
And it got to the point where was 
growling and barking at us in the house.

3765
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:39,700
Scared of everybody and grabbing a 
barking.

3766
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:40,593
Oh Man.
Where we were talking to it like what's 

3767
02:52:41,741 --> 02:52:42,850
wrong,
what's wrong?

3768
02:52:45,090 --> 02:52:47,620
And then we brought it to the vet and 
they were like,

3769
02:52:47,621 --> 02:52:49,980
this dog's fucked.
Really got this temporary.

3770
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:54,100
It was just like a chemical thing.
It's some sort of a disease they can get

3771
02:52:54,101 --> 02:52:58,420
from other dogs and a lot of times dogs 
that didn't have their shots,

3772
02:52:58,690 --> 02:52:59,523
they get it and it can make some dogs 
behave very erratically and you can't 

3773
02:53:03,671 --> 02:53:07,060
correct that.
I don't think they can.

3774
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:10,870
At least they couldn't win.
I had a dog canine distemper,

3775
02:53:11,080 --> 02:53:11,913
contagious and serious viral illness.
No known cure disease affects dogs and 

3776
02:53:17,081 --> 02:53:19,000
certain species of wildlife such as 
raccoons,

3777
02:53:19,001 --> 02:53:19,781
wolves,
foxes,

3778
02:53:19,781 --> 02:53:21,520
and skunks.
Common House pet.

3779
02:53:21,521 --> 02:53:23,680
The Ferret is also a carrier of this 
viral.

3780
02:53:23,681 --> 02:53:25,540
Oh my God.
So that was in your house?

3781
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:26,620
Yeah.
Well,

3782
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:29,560
it's not as bad as rabies,
but for this one dog,

3783
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:30,423
whatever kind of distemper he had,
it was a major simpson as include high 

3784
02:53:34,391 --> 02:53:35,590
fever,
reddened eyes,

3785
02:53:35,591 --> 02:53:39,180
watery discharge for the nose and eyes,
and in fact the dog come with chicken.

3786
02:53:39,230 --> 02:53:44,050
Tired usually become anorexic puppy that
had this as well.

3787
02:53:44,051 --> 02:53:45,910
And his his thing.
Well,

3788
02:53:45,970 --> 02:53:46,803
he didn't have this,
but he had something that gave him 

3789
02:53:48,730 --> 02:53:51,040
seizures and they thought it was 
distemper.

3790
02:53:51,220 --> 02:53:53,170
See fish seizures,
paralysis,

3791
02:53:53,410 --> 02:53:57,130
and attacks of hysteria seed.
That was what my dog had.

3792
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:59,560
He had the hysteria part.
Oh yeah,

3793
02:53:59,561 --> 02:54:01,930
I don't know if he was lethargic.
He was just sitting there,

3794
02:54:02,020 --> 02:54:04,450
even though he's growing.
It wasn't like it was trying to get us,

3795
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:05,943
but he wasn't doing that may result in 
two to five weeks after the initial 

3796
02:54:09,311 --> 02:54:11,680
infection that said,
yeah,

3797
02:54:11,860 --> 02:54:14,080
you have one dog at three.
You have three.

3798
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:14,973
Yeah.
Do you think it's mean to have one dog 

3799
02:54:18,790 --> 02:54:21,590
doesn't mean if you're around the dog 
and hanging out with him every time.

3800
02:54:21,870 --> 02:54:24,130
It gets a lot of love dogs like dogs 
though.

3801
02:54:24,220 --> 02:54:26,630
They do like dogs are pack animals.
Yeah,

3802
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:27,610
they have a good time together.

3803
02:54:27,670 --> 02:54:28,503
Oh my God.
We had this little thing came over to 

3804
02:54:29,741 --> 02:54:34,660
the house that was so happy.
My daughter's got a Chihuahua and so the

3805
02:54:34,661 --> 02:54:35,494
Chihuahua and the uh,
the golden get together and they run 

3806
02:54:38,891 --> 02:54:42,430
around and play and it's like they have 
the fucking best time,

3807
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:47,431
like it's a part and I could go for 
hours running around circles,

3808
02:54:47,651 --> 02:54:49,550
barking at each other.
I don't know.

3809
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:51,190
I mean I'm like,
you know,

3810
02:54:51,760 --> 02:54:54,010
it's a lot of work having.
And I'm like,

3811
02:54:54,011 --> 02:54:56,020
one's enough.
But when I saw them together,

3812
02:54:56,021 --> 02:54:59,620
I had a little weakness,
like especially if it's a good size yard

3813
02:54:59,710 --> 02:55:01,230
where the around.
Yeah.

3814
02:55:01,290 --> 02:55:02,530
Yeah.
It's an okay.

3815
02:55:02,550 --> 02:55:03,383
So the crazy thing is that that used to 
be a wolf even like an English bulldog 

3816
02:55:07,130 --> 02:55:09,950
somewhere along the line that was a wolf
was a wolf.

3817
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:11,900
They all come from that.
Yeah.

3818
02:55:11,901 --> 02:55:15,340
And then the wolves like slowly got 
closer to us by the campfire.

3819
02:55:15,350 --> 02:55:16,760
We had food,
we chuck a little food.

3820
02:55:17,090 --> 02:55:18,710
He'd be cool to ask the other worlds.
So back off.

3821
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:19,640
These guys go through.
They're cool,

3822
02:55:19,700 --> 02:55:20,930
they're cool,
they're cool man.

3823
02:55:21,430 --> 02:55:23,000
Then they became more and more 
submissive.

3824
02:55:23,001 --> 02:55:23,834
They think over time,
one that were more submissive or more 

3825
02:55:26,421 --> 02:55:27,254
accepted and they bred more and then 
their ears started a flop more 

3826
02:55:30,471 --> 02:55:34,310
submissive versus like the ears up,
like listening around for prey.

3827
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:35,373
Right.
Instead they became this thing came to 

3828
02:55:38,781 --> 02:55:40,760
know his dogs.
It's pretty great.

3829
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:44,720
Fucking strange man.
Strange know that when they were.

3830
02:55:44,760 --> 02:55:48,290
Before they started doing those DNA 
tests on dogs,

3831
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:51,860
they thought that they would find that 
dogs came from like a bunch of different

3832
02:55:51,861 --> 02:55:54,500
wild canids,
like a bunch of different wild dogs.

3833
02:55:54,990 --> 02:55:56,580
That's what I would think.
Yeah.

3834
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,390
From North America to.
Because there's so different looking.

3835
02:55:59,940 --> 02:56:02,480
That's crazy heat map.
Well,

3836
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:03,410
so our people though,
right?

3837
02:56:03,830 --> 02:56:05,930
I mean that's the weird thing about life
life.

3838
02:56:05,931 --> 02:56:06,764
Just,
that's one of the reasons why it's so 

3839
02:56:08,331 --> 02:56:09,164
easy for us to like gather up into these
stupid tribes because visually we look 

3840
02:56:13,111 --> 02:56:14,280
so much different.
Right?

3841
02:56:14,490 --> 02:56:15,323
I mean people from South Korea look way 
different than people from Africa and 

3842
02:56:17,961 --> 02:56:20,990
it's very different to not think of us 
all as the same.

3843
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:22,580
Yeah.
So you try bill up,

3844
02:56:22,590 --> 02:56:23,423
but the people that look similar to you 
because you're scared of the other and 

3845
02:56:25,641 --> 02:56:28,820
not even the look.
There's probably like within us,

3846
02:56:28,821 --> 02:56:32,080
there's traits that you don't even know 
that you're recognizing.

3847
02:56:32,081 --> 02:56:32,914
Like when I'm around the Italians,
like there's something about it that's 

3848
02:56:36,710 --> 02:56:38,320
comforting for sure.
You know?

3849
02:56:38,570 --> 02:56:41,540
Yeah.
That's why it's like really funny.

3850
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:42,913
Not Funny,
but it's really odd when like super 

3851
02:56:44,721 --> 02:56:49,721
light skinned black people are like 
really radical black activists,

3852
02:56:49,880 --> 02:56:50,241
you know,
like,

3853
02:56:50,241 --> 02:56:55,100
hi,
are you making that for something here?

3854
02:56:55,100 --> 02:56:55,933
Like what's going on here?
It's just how you actually feel or you 

3855
02:56:58,671 --> 02:57:01,130
like really want to gain acceptance in 
this.

3856
02:57:01,131 --> 02:57:04,580
Try Super Hardcore tribes with knocking 
you.

3857
02:57:05,060 --> 02:57:06,890
You have to like show your,
your,

3858
02:57:06,920 --> 02:57:07,753
you know,
because this one thing that a friend of 

3859
02:57:08,781 --> 02:57:13,670
mine said WHO's black who was talking 
about a black racism and he was like one

3860
02:57:13,671 --> 02:57:14,504
of the weirdest racisms that I've had to
accept his dark people versus a like a 

3861
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:21,093
lighter black skin light skinned light 
skinned people will often times be 

3862
02:57:25,011 --> 02:57:27,620
really racist to dark skin,
black people.

3863
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:28,790
Interesting.
And I was like,

3864
02:57:28,791 --> 02:57:29,624
really?
She's like,

3865
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:30,950
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3866
02:57:30,951 --> 02:57:31,784
there's a big difference difference 
between how light skinned black people 

3867
02:57:35,961 --> 02:57:39,080
feel about dark skin,
black people and vice versa.

3868
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:43,220
And dark skinned black people,
racism within black people.

3869
02:57:43,221 --> 02:57:44,090
I was like,
whoa.

3870
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:47,090
Yeah,
that's a whole mindset that uh,

3871
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:49,160
was trying to understand.

3872
02:57:49,160 --> 02:57:49,993
Just give people enough time and they'll
eventually find a group to belong to 

3873
02:57:53,570 --> 02:57:55,310
that.
They even inside the group,

3874
02:57:55,550 --> 02:57:58,400
like if you ask like the black people 
who are light skin,

3875
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:01,530
do they identify more with the dark 
skinned black people or white people?

3876
02:58:01,531 --> 02:58:03,150
They'd probably see more of the dark 
skinned black people.

3877
02:58:03,240 --> 02:58:04,800
This is obviously a great 
generalization,

3878
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:06,960
but these people that have these issues 
with this thing,

3879
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:10,770
but they probably in comparison to white
people like,

3880
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:13,660
well I'm not that person,
right?

3881
02:58:13,740 --> 02:58:14,573
I'm one of these and more like that guy,
but this guy's not like me because you 

3882
02:58:17,641 --> 02:58:18,474
know,
he's that and I'm this and then this is 

3883
02:58:20,011 --> 02:58:22,080
my group and their group,
you know?

3884
02:58:22,110 --> 02:58:24,720
So even inside groups we have the 
faction,

3885
02:58:25,610 --> 02:58:30,610
hard line Republicans versus a more on 
the libertarian side outright.

3886
02:58:31,480 --> 02:58:32,810
Right,
exactly.

3887
02:58:33,930 --> 02:58:36,180
Just check my profile,
let you know what it's all about.

3888
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:38,570
I'm thinking athletes,
super wonder person,

3889
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:40,920
you know?
I mean,

3890
02:58:40,921 --> 02:58:43,680
that's kind of what it is a lot of ways.
I mean,

3891
02:58:43,681 --> 02:58:45,390
there's good ideas behind all these 
things.

3892
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:46,593
Not withstanding,
especially when you're talking about 

3893
02:58:48,331 --> 02:58:49,111
idea,
not race,

3894
02:58:49,111 --> 02:58:51,720
right?
Like good ideas behind being a Vegan,

3895
02:58:51,721 --> 02:58:52,554
even good ideas behind like a lot of 
right wing Republican ideas like what 

3896
02:58:54,991 --> 02:58:56,790
they're trying to do is noble,
right?

3897
02:58:57,090 --> 02:58:57,923
Yeah.
No,

3898
02:58:57,930 --> 02:59:00,750
absolutely.
In some gas it's the extremes.

3899
02:59:00,751 --> 02:59:01,584
It's the extremes.
It's saying that that my team can never 

3900
02:59:03,781 --> 02:59:06,930
be wrong in any regard and it's just 
been on a team period.

3901
02:59:07,170 --> 02:59:08,003
Just there's a lot.
You gotta accept a lot of bullshit if 

3902
02:59:10,951 --> 02:59:12,270
you want to join a team.
Yeah.

3903
02:59:12,350 --> 02:59:13,560
Billy dropped the ball that.
Fuck.

3904
02:59:13,561 --> 02:59:15,360
Now we lose.
Screw that.

3905
02:59:16,490 --> 02:59:19,420
No Billy Twat get them out and get that 
twice.

3906
02:59:20,450 --> 02:59:22,500
Twice the best word to lots of great 
one.

3907
02:59:22,840 --> 02:59:24,090
My Quad is so good.

3908
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:26,330
That Sargon of a guy was trying to say 
it.

3909
02:59:26,430 --> 02:59:28,110
Tell me it was.
I was spelling.

3910
02:59:28,170 --> 02:59:30,390
Spelling it wrong.
It's not taught that.

3911
02:59:30,391 --> 02:59:33,810
It's that [inaudible],
but he's out of his mind twice.

3912
02:59:33,900 --> 02:59:34,830
How do you say?
Swat?

3913
02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:35,843
Swat.
Team,

3914
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:37,620
Swat.
You say you don't say Swat.

3915
02:59:37,621 --> 02:59:41,100
You fucking Cock sucker.
It doesn't have any.

3916
02:59:41,730 --> 02:59:42,563
First of all,
the idea of English people telling us 

3917
02:59:44,490 --> 02:59:47,860
how to use their language is offensive.
That is really rude.

3918
02:59:49,220 --> 02:59:51,480
Can't tell me how to speak your 
language,

3919
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:56,690
English person back off.
We own it now.

3920
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:57,953
My favorite variation of English though 
is Australian because it's a very 

3921
03:00:00,451 --> 03:00:03,390
distinctive version of ink.
It's not American,

3922
03:00:03,860 --> 03:00:06,200
you know.
No distinctive completely.

3923
03:00:06,300 --> 03:00:08,940
They're off in their own island to 
making up their own rules.

3924
03:00:09,030 --> 03:00:11,190
Like my friend Adam,
my friend Adam Green tree,

3925
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:12,053
who is,
by the way has the most exciting 

3926
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:16,560
instagram story on in the world right 
now.

3927
03:00:16,830 --> 03:00:20,250
He's been living by himself in the back 
country.

3928
03:00:20,750 --> 03:00:22,800
Bowhunting in Colorado.
Yeah,

3929
03:00:22,830 --> 03:00:25,650
totally struck out in Colorado.
He was there for like 20 days.

3930
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:27,990
I started watching because I heard you 
talk to him.

3931
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:33,000
He bailed on Colorado and now he's moved
into the grizzly infested mountains of.

3932
03:00:34,840 --> 03:00:35,790
Well,
not only that,

3933
03:00:35,860 --> 03:00:37,620
the grizzly invested mountains of 
Montana,

3934
03:00:37,621 --> 03:00:38,454
but not only that,
he documented officially documented 

3935
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:42,953
grizzly bears in Colorado where people 
are saying there's no grizzlies in 

3936
03:00:45,481 --> 03:00:46,314
Colorado,
and there's even a website deals with 

3937
03:00:47,761 --> 03:00:48,451
it.
It says,

3938
03:00:48,451 --> 03:00:51,720
the people who say they cited a grizzly 
bear in Colorado,

3939
03:00:51,721 --> 03:00:54,270
it's oftentimes like Sasquatch,
like you think you saw.

3940
03:00:54,510 --> 03:00:55,343
No.
He is an experienced outdoorsmen who's 

3941
03:00:57,840 --> 03:00:58,673
been a bowhunter his whole life.
He knows what he's looking at and he 

3942
03:01:01,151 --> 03:01:01,984
found several grizzly bears in the 
mountains deep in the background and 

3943
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:06,790
recorded it.
Sixteen miles in.

3944
03:01:06,791 --> 03:01:07,624
Yeah,
I mean a little blobs moving around the 

3945
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:09,493
backwards.
Hard to see.

3946
03:01:09,880 --> 03:01:10,713
But,
but they're big and he said that is 

3947
03:01:12,791 --> 03:01:15,940
absolutely 100 percent a fucking 
mountain grizzly bear.

3948
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:18,820
So they're moving into Colorado to.
He's been in the woods a long time,

3949
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:21,110
20 days and now he's back.
He got in a car.

3950
03:01:21,111 --> 03:01:26,111
I rented a car to come a day.
He drove into a think Wyoming or Idaho.

3951
03:01:28,010 --> 03:01:31,300
Whatever's connected to Montana.
I think it's Wyoming.

3952
03:01:31,390 --> 03:01:32,260
No,
Idaho.

3953
03:01:32,290 --> 03:01:33,123
Think it's Tido.
Yeah.

3954
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:33,993
He drove into Idaho and now he's making 
his way down from Idaho into the parks 

3955
03:01:38,141 --> 03:01:42,730
in Idaho and he's hiking into Montana,
into grizzly infested back in Wyoming.

3956
03:01:42,940 --> 03:01:46,060
Coming from the south.
It's fucking scary shit man.

3957
03:01:46,061 --> 03:01:47,770
There's grizzlies everywhere up there.
He,

3958
03:01:47,771 --> 03:01:49,030
uh,
has a family.

3959
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:50,133
Yes it does.
And he's just out in the woods to be 

3960
03:01:51,911 --> 03:01:54,150
scared.
I'm not scared.

3961
03:01:54,190 --> 03:01:55,023
I'm what?
I'm envious of how he gets out of his 

3962
03:01:57,041 --> 03:01:59,590
house to go to the woods for 20 days,
20 days.

3963
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:03,550
My wife would let me.
Well,

3964
03:02:03,551 --> 03:02:04,680
if you were already,
love it.

3965
03:02:05,020 --> 03:02:07,090
If you're updating your instagram story 
constantly.

3966
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:08,013
See,
that's my theory as to why he's doing 

3967
03:02:08,711 --> 03:02:09,460
this.
This way.

3968
03:02:09,460 --> 03:02:11,530
He lets everybody know where he is all 
the time.

3969
03:02:11,950 --> 03:02:12,783
Everybody knows he's okay.
Versus like him just disappearing off 

3970
03:02:14,861 --> 03:02:16,320
the map for 30 days.
Right.

3971
03:02:16,540 --> 03:02:17,373
It is so interesting that you could be 
out there and be able to film stuff and 

3972
03:02:20,411 --> 03:02:23,140
communicate and look at maps and he's a 
savage.

3973
03:02:23,170 --> 03:02:26,380
Not a lot of people can do it that way.
Even most bowhunters will tell you,

3974
03:02:26,381 --> 03:02:27,130
like,
man,

3975
03:02:27,130 --> 03:02:27,963
I'll go for a back country camping trip 
for like seven days by myself for 10 

3976
03:02:31,961 --> 03:02:34,060
days,
but this guy is just gone so deep.

3977
03:02:34,061 --> 03:02:36,310
He's in by yourself,
by himself.

3978
03:02:36,340 --> 03:02:37,450
That's,
that's the thing.

3979
03:02:37,451 --> 03:02:40,240
I mean even even one other friend makes 
a big difference.

3980
03:02:40,360 --> 03:02:41,193
He ran out of food while back,
so you could see him like getting 

3981
03:02:42,641 --> 03:02:43,600
skinnier and skinnier.

3982
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:44,433
As time went on.
He had to go into town and get more 

3983
03:02:45,971 --> 03:02:47,140
food.
Oh my God,

3984
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:50,390
and ran out of food.
You see it in his face,

3985
03:02:50,391 --> 03:02:51,224
like his face is getting more gaunt.
His eyes are getting more sunken in and 

3986
03:02:53,311 --> 03:02:54,010
it's like,
oh,

3987
03:02:54,010 --> 03:02:55,270
I saw.
I'm like exhausted.

3988
03:02:55,271 --> 03:02:57,220
At one point he was just like laying 
back.

3989
03:02:57,280 --> 03:02:59,380
So deep man.
I mean what he's doing,

3990
03:02:59,381 --> 03:03:03,010
he had a filter water through a piece of
a wet.

3991
03:03:03,180 --> 03:03:06,190
Oh,
like old rotting piece of wood.

3992
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:07,533
He poured the oil because his filter was
back at Camp 16 miles away because he 

3993
03:03:10,481 --> 03:03:11,314
had been running.
He'd been getting so much fresh water 

3994
03:03:12,701 --> 03:03:14,710
that was pumping right out of the ground
from springs.

3995
03:03:14,711 --> 03:03:15,544
You could just drink that,
but when you come to a creek like you 

3996
03:03:17,951 --> 03:03:20,650
have to take a chance because he could 
be Giardia [inaudible],

3997
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:23,410
beaver's shit and the dam and you get 
what they call beaver fever.

3998
03:03:23,470 --> 03:03:24,700
Oh boy.
You Shit.

3999
03:03:24,701 --> 03:03:29,050
Your brains like rocket projectile,
broken fire hydrant,

4000
03:03:29,051 --> 03:03:32,710
diarrhea.
Just where your body's like,

4001
03:03:32,711 --> 03:03:33,231
Hey,
fuck.

4002
03:03:33,231 --> 03:03:35,260
Had He.
I saw him taking a sip and saying,

4003
03:03:35,261 --> 03:03:39,460
I might regret this apple days.
Oh Man.

4004
03:03:39,700 --> 03:03:40,533
Yeah.
He drinks a lot of straight out of the 

4005
03:03:41,291 --> 03:03:43,480
ground and he just doesn't.
This is Gig.

4006
03:03:43,810 --> 03:03:44,643
Well,
he has a company in Australia and he's 

4007
03:03:46,841 --> 03:03:47,674
kind of his own boss,
so he gets to decide that he goes on on 

4008
03:03:49,931 --> 03:03:50,764
the road 30 days at a time and do this,
but he's a very famous professional 

4009
03:03:54,731 --> 03:03:56,080
bowhunter too.
Wow.

4010
03:03:56,130 --> 03:03:56,870
Yeah.
That's crazy.

4011
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:58,130
Crazy insta story.

4012
03:03:58,130 --> 03:04:01,040
If you're interested.
It's like for these guys that want to do

4013
03:04:01,041 --> 03:04:03,330
these back country solo haunts,
but it's.

4014
03:04:03,980 --> 03:04:05,930
There is.
Look at his face in the far left.

4015
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:08,600
He asked a lot of weight and yeah,
he had a little.

4016
03:04:08,660 --> 03:04:09,493
He's going to be shredded when he gets 
off the mountain pose for a fucking 

4017
03:04:12,381 --> 03:04:13,450
calendar.
He's a handsome fella,

4018
03:04:13,451 --> 03:04:15,710
isn't it?
It's so funny.

4019
03:04:15,720 --> 03:04:19,130
Like it's amazing.
Like just social media.

4020
03:04:19,131 --> 03:04:23,000
It's like you watch him and he's like 
out in the woods by himself.

4021
03:04:23,001 --> 03:04:25,160
Then the next story is,
hey,

4022
03:04:25,161 --> 03:04:26,870
the my,
my show,

4023
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:29,900
my show at the ice house.
It's really having a good time.

4024
03:04:30,590 --> 03:04:31,423
I know he's crazy.
He's pretty hard because different 

4025
03:04:33,021 --> 03:04:34,750
lives,
you know,

4026
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:37,490
but I was gonna say their,
their version of the English language is

4027
03:04:37,491 --> 03:04:39,050
the best.
He'll say,

4028
03:04:39,051 --> 03:04:39,884
you know,
but I've got my tent and got me go over 

4029
03:04:41,451 --> 03:04:41,840
here.

4030
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:43,550
I've got me water supply,
I'm all good.

4031
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:45,480
Everything's me.
This me that.

4032
03:04:46,340 --> 03:04:48,830
That to me is like my favorite version 
of the English language.

4033
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:52,270
Like English sounds slightly cooler than
American [inaudible],

4034
03:04:52,580 --> 03:04:54,920
but Australia and slightly cooler than 
English.

4035
03:04:55,490 --> 03:05:00,490
That's the most to learn English 
language sounds a little,

4036
03:05:00,531 --> 03:05:03,230
uh,
sends a little reckless to me.

4037
03:05:03,860 --> 03:05:05,540
Do you think so it's a reckless 
language.

4038
03:05:07,460 --> 03:05:11,330
Wound up everything.
Kill them over there.

4039
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:12,770
Wound up,
yeah.

4040
03:05:12,771 --> 03:05:13,604
They got to be wound up fucking snakes 
and spiders and crocodiles and they're 

4041
03:05:15,971 --> 03:05:16,804
surrounded by sharks.
They're all out there on their own to 

4042
03:05:19,570 --> 03:05:21,800
tax them because no one,
no one is going to help.

4043
03:05:22,220 --> 03:05:22,820
Yeah,
I mean,

4044
03:05:22,820 --> 03:05:26,150
how big is the Australian army?
It's like 25 people I think.

4045
03:05:26,300 --> 03:05:28,520
Well,
the whole place is only as the amount of

4046
03:05:28,521 --> 03:05:31,400
people.
It's the same size as America,

4047
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:33,650
but the amount of people is the same as 
California.

4048
03:05:33,650 --> 03:05:35,000
Slightly less than.
Oh,

4049
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:37,280
that sounds great.
I'll just drive around.

4050
03:05:37,310 --> 03:05:42,310
I was just saying this before to Jamie 
that I think living in La,

4051
03:05:43,580 --> 03:05:47,600
I just feel like I'm going to end up the
cranky guy that can't be around people.

4052
03:05:48,220 --> 03:05:51,020
I.
There's so many people around us all the

4053
03:05:51,021 --> 03:05:52,000
time.
Yeah.

4054
03:05:52,340 --> 03:05:54,380
It just,
it's exhausting.

4055
03:05:54,740 --> 03:05:56,450
It is,
but it's also energizing,

4056
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:57,760
right?
Somewhat.

4057
03:05:58,060 --> 03:06:01,250
When I come back from the woods might go
somewhere like.

4058
03:06:01,310 --> 03:06:02,990
Especially camping.
Yeah.

4059
03:06:03,220 --> 03:06:04,053
And then you come back to civilization.
You kind of appreciate restaurants and 

4060
03:06:08,360 --> 03:06:09,620
movie theaters.
Yeah.

4061
03:06:09,650 --> 03:06:12,290
Get some popcorn and watch a movie.
Just like being around it.

4062
03:06:12,320 --> 03:06:13,970
Maybe that's it.
You just need breaks from it.

4063
03:06:14,500 --> 03:06:15,530
That's what I think.
Yeah.

4064
03:06:15,560 --> 03:06:17,900
I think the best of both worlds is both 
worlds,

4065
03:06:17,990 --> 03:06:18,823
right?
I think just living by yourself in the 

4066
03:06:20,451 --> 03:06:21,320
woods,
like the unibomber,

4067
03:06:21,321 --> 03:06:22,154
like what the fuck,
dude,

4068
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:23,540
I don't want to end up that way.

4069
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:27,020
Their loan with nature,
nature.

4070
03:06:27,290 --> 03:06:28,720
No fucking phones.
Pussy.

4071
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:31,340
What's going on?
Do that.

4072
03:06:31,880 --> 03:06:34,340
Total military personnel.
Eighty 1000.

4073
03:06:34,580 --> 03:06:37,010
We have $81,000
military in my house.

4074
03:06:37,570 --> 03:06:38,403
No amount of military that America.
What's the amount of military in 

4075
03:06:44,821 --> 03:06:46,460
America?
Yes.

4076
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:47,573
Let's guests before we search.
How many people are in the United 

4077
03:06:50,750 --> 03:06:52,250
States?
Military members?

4078
03:06:52,720 --> 03:06:54,120
We're not even gonna.
Include the coast guard.

4079
03:06:55,830 --> 03:06:58,170
You have to include the Coast Guard,
Navy,

4080
03:06:58,200 --> 03:06:59,400
Coast Guard,
marines,

4081
03:06:59,401 --> 03:07:00,420
air force,
army.

4082
03:07:01,290 --> 03:07:04,710
4 million.
Eighteen million.

4083
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:08,250
70 million.
70.

4084
03:07:08,480 --> 03:07:09,510
I'm going crazy.
No.

4085
03:07:09,810 --> 03:07:10,980
Three,
two point six.

4086
03:07:11,010 --> 03:07:14,310
Two point three rather than the total 
population.

4087
03:07:14,311 --> 03:07:15,240
Three 23.
Well,

4088
03:07:15,241 --> 03:07:18,720
they're not including mice is ran at 
$23.

4089
03:07:18,721 --> 03:07:21,540
Million then total military.
Two million.

4090
03:07:21,541 --> 03:07:22,590
300.
Wow.

4091
03:07:22,830 --> 03:07:23,663
So less than 10 percent.
You know what's interesting about that 

4092
03:07:25,621 --> 03:07:26,131
number,
man?

4093
03:07:26,131 --> 03:07:28,920
I remember when $250 million when they.
When I was a kid,

4094
03:07:29,280 --> 03:07:30,113
the population was 250.
I remember because I remember thinking 

4095
03:07:32,130 --> 03:07:33,180
me and my friends were sitting around.

4096
03:07:33,180 --> 03:07:36,600
We were in high school.
We were like 250 million.

4097
03:07:36,660 --> 03:07:38,070
Yeah.
How the fuck are there?

4098
03:07:38,071 --> 03:07:39,300
That many people?
Yeah.

4099
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:40,710
We were like,
wow,

4100
03:07:41,670 --> 03:07:45,780
now it's almost 100 million more.
My God in the world.

4101
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,780
It's like 7 billion.
But what was it then?

4102
03:07:49,230 --> 03:07:50,063
I think.
I think in like the eighties when I was 

4103
03:07:51,721 --> 03:07:54,510
in high school.
I bet there was a half.

4104
03:07:54,870 --> 03:07:56,310
Yeah,
I bet there was like three.

4105
03:07:56,640 --> 03:07:59,290
Yeah,
we've met,

4106
03:07:59,320 --> 03:08:01,140
we've learned to survive to.
Well,

4107
03:08:02,430 --> 03:08:06,540
it's amazing.
So many people got all this food shipped

4108
03:08:06,541 --> 03:08:11,541
into these cities and Madison factory 
farming and medicine are living longer,

4109
03:08:12,690 --> 03:08:15,650
living much longer,
longer,

4110
03:08:15,690 --> 03:08:16,523
so many people during the last eclipse.
That's what the stat that blew my mind 

4111
03:08:21,060 --> 03:08:24,750
during the last time we had an eclipse,
total eclipse like that on our,

4112
03:08:24,751 --> 03:08:26,190
uh,
on our continent.

4113
03:08:26,980 --> 03:08:29,640
It was 100 years ago,
100 years ago.

4114
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:30,893
There were fewer people in the whole 
state of California than who live in La 

4115
03:08:34,141 --> 03:08:34,974
today.

4116
03:08:35,790 --> 03:08:37,140
Oh,
it must be nice.

4117
03:08:37,290 --> 03:08:37,990
Oh,
must have been.

4118
03:08:37,990 --> 03:08:41,130
Gloria gets to the comedy store in like 
10 minutes on a bike.

4119
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:46,190
It was rolled out in the world.
Sweet.

4120
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:49,020
My,
it was like a small town.

4121
03:08:49,050 --> 03:08:51,630
So many damn people.
Nineteen 17.

4122
03:08:51,631 --> 03:08:56,430
There's 3 million people in California 
in the whole state.

4123
03:08:56,730 --> 03:08:57,563
That's way less than la million.
Three people and they were probably 

4124
03:09:04,410 --> 03:09:07,360
like,
there's so many fucking people gross.

4125
03:09:07,830 --> 03:09:11,670
I can't go to town one more time running
into those asshole.

4126
03:09:11,671 --> 03:09:12,900
What is today,
Texas?

4127
03:09:12,901 --> 03:09:15,810
What does Texas have today?
Go to the very end here.

4128
03:09:15,960 --> 03:09:20,100
Texas has 27 million Canada,
the entire country of Canada.

4129
03:09:20,130 --> 03:09:22,140
Thirty 6 million.
Oh my God,

4130
03:09:22,141 --> 03:09:22,974
I'll fornia $39 million.
So California has more people than 

4131
03:09:25,141 --> 03:09:27,060
fucking Canada,
so I'm not going crazy.

4132
03:09:27,061 --> 03:09:29,760
It's a real thing.
Yeah.

4133
03:09:29,820 --> 03:09:33,090
Well that's also one of the reasons why 
California or the Canada,

4134
03:09:33,150 --> 03:09:34,140
the people are so nice.

4135
03:09:34,830 --> 03:09:36,810
They're not as overwhelmed.
Yeah.

4136
03:09:36,900 --> 03:09:37,733
They're surprised to see you see that,
that bear on the fucking California 

4137
03:09:41,101 --> 03:09:41,621
signed.
Yeah.

4138
03:09:41,621 --> 03:09:42,454
That's crazy.
That bears that are extinct in 

4139
03:09:45,211 --> 03:09:46,680
California.
What is that?

4140
03:09:46,681 --> 03:09:47,514
That's a grizzly grizzly.
They used to have grizzlies in 

4141
03:09:48,721 --> 03:09:49,830
California.
In fact,

4142
03:09:49,831 --> 03:09:54,831
the last grizzly that killed a man in 
California before they killed him was in

4143
03:09:55,001 --> 03:09:57,550
Lubbock,
back California.

4144
03:09:57,610 --> 03:10:01,570
There's a guy that was the last guy 
killed by a bear in California.

4145
03:10:01,571 --> 03:10:02,404
His name,
I think it was Stephen Labeck something 

4146
03:10:04,450 --> 03:10:05,560
l e b,
e c,

4147
03:10:06,070 --> 03:10:06,903
and they named the town after him.
He was the last guy in California to be 

4148
03:10:09,611 --> 03:10:14,080
killed by bears.
We used to have huge bears in the 1800.

4149
03:10:14,081 --> 03:10:16,570
Think it was.
I think it was then the 18 hundreds,

4150
03:10:16,571 --> 03:10:18,880
but they killed them because they were 
killing all the people,

4151
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,790
like they were killing us.
It was us or them,

4152
03:10:21,791 --> 03:10:24,340
but meanwhile it's damn we put on the 
flag like we won,

4153
03:10:24,341 --> 03:10:26,560
but we miss you buddy,
so puts you on the flag.

4154
03:10:26,560 --> 03:10:27,460
We love you.
We will.

4155
03:10:27,461 --> 03:10:29,700
We love looking at you,
but you've got to stop eating us.

4156
03:10:29,701 --> 03:10:31,430
And so we had to shoot you all.
You know.

4157
03:10:31,450 --> 03:10:32,283
It's lame about that is a,
it's similar to what happened with the 

4158
03:10:35,591 --> 03:10:38,760
native Americans,
but it's not think it is.

4159
03:10:38,890 --> 03:10:41,800
You know what most we killed most of the
native Americans in this country.

4160
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,510
Disease.
Smallpox,

4161
03:10:43,540 --> 03:10:46,060
like a bunch of diseases.
Can we present that?

4162
03:10:46,061 --> 03:10:47,050
We brought to them.
Yeah.

4163
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:49,000
That crazy.
Ninety percent of them were killed.

4164
03:10:49,001 --> 03:10:50,650
Wiped out by disease.
Yeah.

4165
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:51,820
I was taught.
We killed them all.

4166
03:10:52,180 --> 03:10:54,130
We killed a lot of them for sure.
Not We.

4167
03:10:54,131 --> 03:10:54,964
I shouldn't say we.
I was just reading the grandchild of 

4168
03:10:56,501 --> 03:10:57,190
immigrants.
Yeah.

4169
03:10:57,190 --> 03:10:59,740
I was just reading exactly what we were 
in Italy at the time,

4170
03:10:59,741 --> 03:11:02,260
enjoying ourselves.
There was a lake.

4171
03:11:02,290 --> 03:11:03,123
The Tinaya Lake in a yosemite is named 
after this chief Tinaya who we killed 

4172
03:11:10,511 --> 03:11:11,650
his son.

4173
03:11:12,430 --> 03:11:16,110
We killed his son in front of him.
We should stop saying way.

4174
03:11:16,190 --> 03:11:19,270
I know it wasn't.
I feel guilty.

4175
03:11:19,271 --> 03:11:21,490
I had,
I had that in my act for a while.

4176
03:11:21,491 --> 03:11:22,780
My daughter was like,
why did we do that?

4177
03:11:22,781 --> 03:11:23,730
I'm like,
easy with the.

4178
03:11:23,750 --> 03:11:24,583
We,
we were on vespas and eating spaghetti 

4179
03:11:27,161 --> 03:11:32,161
were lovers a uh,
and then named the lake after him killed

4180
03:11:33,521 --> 03:11:35,590
his kid in front of him,
made him suffer,

4181
03:11:35,610 --> 03:11:37,840
killed him,
and then named the lake after him.

4182
03:11:37,841 --> 03:11:38,674
It's like,
it absolves us of the guilt and we're 

4183
03:11:40,760 --> 03:11:43,930
just step out tonight or there was some 
horrible,

4184
03:11:43,931 --> 03:11:47,050
horrible shit going on back then.
Horrible all over the world.

4185
03:11:47,051 --> 03:11:48,280
I mean,
and even before that,

4186
03:11:48,281 --> 03:11:49,114
like the accounts of what Columbus did 
when they encountered the natives and 

4187
03:11:52,030 --> 03:11:52,570
then,
you know,

4188
03:11:52,570 --> 03:11:55,060
they're trying to get gold out these 
people and slaughtered these people.

4189
03:11:55,061 --> 03:11:56,500
Slaughtered.
I mean,

4190
03:11:56,560 --> 03:11:57,970
just serial killer type shit.

4191
03:11:58,890 --> 03:12:00,040
I mean,
that's.

4192
03:12:00,100 --> 03:12:02,200
We used to have Columbus to.
I guess we still do,

4193
03:12:02,330 --> 03:12:03,970
not,
not in California.

4194
03:12:03,971 --> 03:12:06,340
They're getting rid of it.
They voted it apple debt.

4195
03:12:06,390 --> 03:12:07,450
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

4196
03:12:07,570 --> 03:12:08,970
But in New York,
uh,

4197
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:09,833
you know,
Columbus circle and they still have the 

4198
03:12:11,220 --> 03:12:14,530
somewhat deface the Columbus,
a statue in central park.

4199
03:12:14,531 --> 03:12:17,470
The other day I stopped doing that man.
Just like you gotta stop,

4200
03:12:17,590 --> 03:12:18,423
you can't deface gingiss con statue.
It's one thing to revere and worship 

4201
03:12:22,661 --> 03:12:24,580
these people and we definitely shouldn't
do that anymore.

4202
03:12:24,820 --> 03:12:28,540
But like to those statues are history.
We should look at it but understand what

4203
03:12:28,541 --> 03:12:29,374
we're looking at.
But we're not worshiping the statue of 

4204
03:12:31,991 --> 03:12:32,824
Christopher Columbus.
But it is a fascinating thing to know 

4205
03:12:34,301 --> 03:12:37,900
that this monster got in a boat and sail
across the ocean.

4206
03:12:37,901 --> 03:12:38,734
If it wasn't for him,
likely wouldn't be a whole population 

4207
03:12:40,961 --> 03:12:41,794
here and the people that he went with.
I think you've got to add some new 

4208
03:12:44,380 --> 03:12:45,213
statues,
statues of other people that had a 

4209
03:12:49,180 --> 03:12:50,960
positive impact on stuff.
You know.

4210
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:52,160
You know what's fucked up though about

4211
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:52,993
a lot of these civil war statues that 
people are wanting to tear down now and 

4212
03:12:55,821 --> 03:12:59,330
destroying it's fucked up was when you 
look at when those things were built,

4213
03:12:59,690 --> 03:13:00,523
those things weren't built like way 
before the civil rights movement and 

4214
03:13:03,231 --> 03:13:04,064
there are a relic of an ancient past.
A lot of them were built in response to 

4215
03:13:08,151 --> 03:13:11,300
the civil rights movement.
So they really are racist and origin.

4216
03:13:11,360 --> 03:13:12,193
Yeah.
A lot of the Robert e Dot Lee ones and 

4217
03:13:13,281 --> 03:13:18,140
all that shit where the world and the 
south going to rise again and yeah.

4218
03:13:18,141 --> 03:13:18,974
No,
they weren't around since the 18 

4219
03:13:20,361 --> 03:13:21,194
hundreds.
It was like 65 and line from a made 

4220
03:13:24,351 --> 03:13:25,184
really quickly and shittily in response 
to the civil rights movement and that 

4221
03:13:28,551 --> 03:13:29,384
they were made out of copper and bronze 
and shit cause it was easier to do than 

4222
03:13:32,031 --> 03:13:33,170
stone.
Oh really?

4223
03:13:33,171 --> 03:13:34,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

4224
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:35,510
No,
it's not good.

4225
03:13:35,810 --> 03:13:36,643
Now we had to create some other people,
like a visualization of the number of 

4226
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:44,870
monuments that were erected and what,
how awesome.

4227
03:13:45,050 --> 03:13:46,860
These are all civil war monuments.
Uh,

4228
03:13:46,880 --> 03:13:48,080
yeah.
We'll get that shit.

4229
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:52,250
Naacp was found a giant spike in civil 
war monuments.

4230
03:13:52,870 --> 03:13:54,080
Wow.
Look at that,

4231
03:13:54,081 --> 03:13:55,130
man.
That's crazy.

4232
03:13:55,131 --> 03:13:57,560
Yeah.
It was a retaliation summer race riots,

4233
03:13:57,590 --> 03:14:01,460
giant spike and civil war monuments,
Tulsa race riots.

4234
03:14:01,490 --> 03:14:04,520
Giant spike in civil war.
Civil war statues.

4235
03:14:04,670 --> 03:14:05,720
That's nuts,
man.

4236
03:14:05,870 --> 03:14:07,970
Yeah,
like you could track it.

4237
03:14:08,610 --> 03:14:10,460
A bigger version of this too.
I was trying to find right now,

4238
03:14:10,461 --> 03:14:13,250
but we got this little chunk.
That's spooky.

4239
03:14:13,340 --> 03:14:15,380
Yeah,
because no one's talking about that when

4240
03:14:15,381 --> 03:14:16,214
they're talking about keeping these 
things up and they represent our 

4241
03:14:17,931 --> 03:14:19,280
heritage,
like yeah,

4242
03:14:19,281 --> 03:14:20,114
I understand what you're saying,
but worshiping this is a real problem 

4243
03:14:23,781 --> 03:14:24,614
because you got to realize what was the 
motivation to put like why is it okay 

4244
03:14:27,561 --> 03:14:28,394
though for me?

4245
03:14:28,550 --> 03:14:29,331
Why?
Why?

4246
03:14:29,331 --> 03:14:30,164
Why do I look at it and go,
I have a problem with this because they 

4247
03:14:32,241 --> 03:14:33,074
did it during the racist 19 sixties or 
during the early 19 hundreds and the 

4248
03:14:36,530 --> 03:14:37,363
naacp was created.
I would accept it better if it was 200 

4249
03:14:40,551 --> 03:14:42,410
years old instead of 100.
Like what's wrong with.

4250
03:14:42,450 --> 03:14:43,970
Right?
Like why do I care?

4251
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:45,710
Right.
What do you mean?

4252
03:14:45,711 --> 03:14:46,431
Why?
I mean,

4253
03:14:46,431 --> 03:14:48,650
why?
Why is it like,

4254
03:14:48,930 --> 03:14:49,763
I mean,
why is it more offensive that it was 

4255
03:14:51,501 --> 03:14:52,334
created by racists in the 19 sixties 
than if it was created by racist 200 

4256
03:14:55,521 --> 03:14:57,010
years ago?
Maybe it's because,

4257
03:14:57,011 --> 03:14:59,930
like I said,
direct line people alive right now.

4258
03:14:59,940 --> 03:15:01,010
Yeah,
exactly.

4259
03:15:02,660 --> 03:15:03,860
Yeah.
That's dirty.

4260
03:15:03,950 --> 03:15:05,810
It's dirty.
When you look at the actual spikes.

4261
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:08,570
Yeah.
George Wallace.

4262
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:12,780
It jumped up during the assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr.

4263
03:15:12,780 --> 03:15:13,613
Woo.
When George Wallace was blocking the 

4264
03:15:14,130 --> 03:15:17,480
school's jumped up a whole bunch.
That's Weird.

4265
03:15:17,510 --> 03:15:18,200
Yeah.

4266
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:19,730
Detroit race riots.
Boom.

4267
03:15:19,731 --> 03:15:24,020
We got a little spike hanGing onto it.
Not so fast.

4268
03:15:24,050 --> 03:15:25,650
Teams at war.
Yeah.

4269
03:15:26,450 --> 03:15:28,790
Act of kindness.
That's not an act of kindness.

4270
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:31,850
That's putting a statue up there out of 
out of love.

4271
03:15:32,210 --> 03:15:33,043
Do you ever think though that those 
people that Were doing all this stuff 

4272
03:15:36,021 --> 03:15:36,854
back then,
they really didn't have a direct 

4273
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,373
connection with the world the way we 
have today and then one of the reasons 

4274
03:15:41,871 --> 03:15:44,810
why we're seeing all these people 
tearing these things down now is because

4275
03:15:44,811 --> 03:15:47,450
we all have a direct connection with 
each other and we realized that,

4276
03:15:47,451 --> 03:15:49,100
hey,
these civil war,

4277
03:15:49,770 --> 03:15:52,110
they're fucking horrible.
What the civil war was,

4278
03:15:52,111 --> 03:15:52,944
was horrible,
like saying that it's a part of your 

4279
03:15:54,271 --> 03:15:55,440
culture.
This is horse shit.

4280
03:15:55,441 --> 03:15:55,771
Like,
no,

4281
03:15:55,771 --> 03:15:56,604
this is a part of a terrible attempted 
genocide on black people did demonizing 

4282
03:16:01,381 --> 03:16:06,381
to the point where they were the other 
and it was okay to enslave them hundreds

4283
03:16:06,780 --> 03:16:06,870
of years.

4284
03:16:06,870 --> 03:16:07,703
No.
You could live in in New York state and 

4285
03:16:09,571 --> 03:16:12,060
not have any idea really what was going 
on

4286
03:16:12,170 --> 03:16:13,490
the south at the time.
No,

4287
03:16:13,491 --> 03:16:14,061
no,
no.

4288
03:16:14,061 --> 03:16:17,130
You don't understand.
The civil war was about economics.

4289
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:20,840
I've seen that argument too,
but I've seen an argument torn apart.

4290
03:16:20,910 --> 03:16:21,743
If there was social media back then,
do you think slavery would have even 

4291
03:16:24,510 --> 03:16:25,330
existed?

4292
03:16:25,330 --> 03:16:26,290
No,
and here's the thing.

4293
03:16:26,350 --> 03:16:27,670
Nobody wants slavery today.
If you do,

4294
03:16:27,671 --> 03:16:28,504
you're a cunt too.
It doesn't mean that when you guys 

4295
03:16:31,811 --> 03:16:32,644
define yourself by a war that you lost 
and the war had a big part of what the 

4296
03:16:37,061 --> 03:16:38,230
war was about.
Slavery.

4297
03:16:38,410 --> 03:16:41,950
That's a giant problem.
It's a big giant problem.

4298
03:16:41,951 --> 03:16:42,784
And how the world looks at us and looks 
at you and the way you look at yourself 

4299
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:48,430
like you're.
Yeah,

4300
03:16:48,550 --> 03:16:49,383
you're justifying some of the most 
horrific shit in human history so far 

4301
03:16:53,711 --> 03:16:55,220
from american history.
Yeah.

4302
03:16:55,540 --> 03:16:57,340
That's not out of kindness.
Slavery.

4303
03:16:57,350 --> 03:17:00,240
They actually live better.
That argument.

4304
03:17:00,710 --> 03:17:02,470
Better slaves.
Oh gee,

4305
03:17:02,471 --> 03:17:03,304
that's weird.
Wouldn't how strange is it that people 

4306
03:17:04,991 --> 03:17:05,824
live better when you fed them and they 
lived in fucking cages then when they 

4307
03:17:09,251 --> 03:17:10,084
were released with no skills and no 
education and couldn't read and how to 

4308
03:17:12,671 --> 03:17:13,504
repopulate,
and I'm like in a country that they 

4309
03:17:14,771 --> 03:17:15,604
don't even.

4310
03:17:15,900 --> 03:17:16,733
It's not even a country of their origin 
as you're still putting up a statue on 

4311
03:17:19,571 --> 03:17:20,404
your way out the door of the fucking 
general who fought to keep slavery 

4312
03:17:23,261 --> 03:17:25,870
alive.
Let's move on.

4313
03:17:25,900 --> 03:17:28,420
It doesn't mean that the south is an 
awesome folks.

4314
03:17:28,421 --> 03:17:30,710
It doesn't mean that you're not awesome,
you know,

4315
03:17:30,880 --> 03:17:33,460
but let's move forward.
Stop with the teams.

4316
03:17:33,550 --> 03:17:34,510
Here's the problem,
right?

4317
03:17:34,930 --> 03:17:36,450
What do you do about old leonard 
skinner,

4318
03:17:36,451 --> 03:17:41,451
the albums that fucking fly that flag 
represent to the dukes of hazzard.

4319
03:17:44,230 --> 03:17:45,640
I know.
Yeah,

4320
03:17:45,641 --> 03:17:47,980
I know.
Own neil young.

4321
03:17:48,640 --> 03:17:51,430
IT's tricky.
It's like all things.

4322
03:17:51,640 --> 03:17:53,860
It's not that black and white.
You can absolute.

4323
03:17:53,870 --> 03:17:56,250
That has some awesome shit.

4324
03:17:56,270 --> 03:17:57,770
Well,
they also don't want to,

4325
03:17:57,860 --> 03:18:01,340
there is a danger in wiping out history,
so we don't learn from it.

4326
03:18:01,341 --> 03:18:02,174
Like you can't do that either.
Like you can't just pretend this thing 

4327
03:18:04,760 --> 03:18:07,760
didn't exist and that there's remnants 
of it still around.

4328
03:18:07,761 --> 03:18:10,130
You need to be educated,
have,

4329
03:18:10,430 --> 03:18:13,850
if we're going to learn from history,
you need to educate yourself about it.

4330
03:18:13,851 --> 03:18:14,361
Yeah,
absolutely.

4331
03:18:14,361 --> 03:18:17,300
So you can't just sweep it all unDer the
rug and think,

4332
03:18:17,420 --> 03:18:18,560
okay,
if we don't see it,

4333
03:18:18,561 --> 03:18:19,870
it didn't exist.
Yeah,

4334
03:18:20,140 --> 03:18:20,973
absolutely.

4335
03:18:21,070 --> 03:18:22,980
You know,
and on that note,

4336
03:18:22,981 --> 03:18:26,790
tom papa was bringing his pitch home.
This cigar was so nice.

4337
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:28,140
Very good.
Very good.

4338
03:18:28,150 --> 03:18:29,000
So great.
What's it,

4339
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:31,770
what's it called?
A believer?

4340
03:18:31,860 --> 03:18:36,360
oliva oliver oliver.
Hopefully created by highly skilled,

4341
03:18:36,361 --> 03:18:40,030
well compensated craftsmen and women.
Are you swimming?

4342
03:18:40,560 --> 03:18:41,393
Are you a.
You're going on the road for a Bit on 

4343
03:18:43,441 --> 03:18:45,720
the road again,
cranking it out.

4344
03:18:45,750 --> 03:18:48,160
I'm doing the comedy store saturday.

And if you have not seen tom,

4358
03:19:13,211 --> 03:19:15,400
papa is one.
God damn hilarious.

4359
03:19:15,401 --> 03:19:17,860
Standup comedian.
So go out and see him live.

4360
03:19:17,861 --> 03:19:19,900
You fucks.
I'm glad we got this in.

4361
03:19:19,901 --> 03:19:22,080
This was a nice treat.
I didn't think I'd see him for awhile.

4362
03:19:22,150 --> 03:19:22,970
Fucking fun,
man.

4363
03:19:22,970 --> 03:19:23,751
Yeah,
always the best.

4364

And I got some elk for you.
Here we go.

4365

You're the best buy guy.
See a girl.

4366
03:19:29,440 --> 03:19:30,560
Girls to bugger off soon.
