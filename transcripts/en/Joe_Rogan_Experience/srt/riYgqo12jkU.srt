1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,160
Oh Christ.
He's all right.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,580
All right, we're going live
now. Finally, here we go.

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:13,581
We had a just disaster trying to order
from the UFC TV app and then so we had to

4
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,340
go through your direct TV and then we
went to direct TV and then we had to call

5
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:24,690
in and they couldn't talk to a person. I
had to enter in shit, so I had a check.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,510
Find my fucking account number
online. We all panicked. The debit.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,760
We panicked a little bit but we're here.
Eddie Bravo's here. Ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,050
Hello. How are you doing
Brian? Motherfucker Collins
here. So everybody hell,

9
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,840
are you good to be a good to be here?
Brian bought wine.

10
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:41,350
That could be a good or a bad decision.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,610
We're gone California first then we're
going to go a little Italy for my boy at

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,900
via Veneto courtesy.
Okay.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,060
Fuck Riccio he's giving shout
outs already. We just started,

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,570
he gave me some great one.
Yancy Madeiros one already.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,650
We didn't even get a chance
to watch the fight cause it.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,900
We just just got it live and
printed motherfucking job.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,390
What is going on with that shirt?
You are in like a 1980s he sure is movie.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,700
Oh I'm glad you mentioned that Michael J.
Fox.

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,500
Well you look like a dude who's in
one of those breaking movie. Yeah,

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,800
everybody should have a Bandana.

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,550
Usually a tough guy with a
switchblade in an eighties movie.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,701
That's what you should do.

23
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:26,280
A poor Mexican chicks wear jeans of that
material that they do do that swap in

24
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:31,281
right now cause that's just artificially
stretched in the extra e kids are

25
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,250
wearing it. They just
showed shogun. Did you,

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,370
have you seen the UFC light heavyweight
rankings? Yeah, he's like three.

27
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,220
It's kind of your Skype for four.
It's really crazy.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,730
They're going to have that owes Demir
Dude, he's going to fight Jimi Manoa. Oh,

29
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,100
you're talking about
pound for pound champion.

30
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,390
He's had two fights in the UFC
and he's like number three now.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,630
Weird light heavyweights. The
weirdest division. Jones out.

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,880
Kill it with John Jones out and Gustafson
obviously just rose to the top of the

33
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:04,440
heap. How good did he look?
God Damn. Wash that fight.

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,270
Which one? Gustafson and to share.
I missed that whole EOC. It was she,

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,180
I was on my way back down
to cost of sin was a Ninja.

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,390
It'd be tough to beat man.
Dude. He was so on point.

37
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:18,990
It was one of the best performances of
his entire career. It was incredible.

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,820
Those upper cuts. Oh my God.
Accuracy that heard c was insane.

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,260
I heard the fight companion, but I
didn't actually watch it happen. Dude.

40
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,190
He was amazing.
Gustafson was as good as he's APP.

41
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,980
I don't think he's ever looked better.
He's good.

42
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:37,200
He's gonna be a handful to beat for John
NDC. Yeah, he's, he's coming into his own,

43
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,870
you know, he's 30 years old
and fighting for a long time.

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,710
He said tough fights with John.
Tough fight with DC.

45
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,670
He got beat up by rumble, you know,
and he's took a long time off,

46
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:51,570
came back and look better than he's ever
lived. Has Knee, wasn't he for a second?

47
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,760
They're thinking about retiring
in his hometown. Just top on.

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,500
I bet you he's the light heavyweight
champ by the end of the year. He could be,

49
00:02:59,530 --> 00:02:59,980
do you think he

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,120
beats John John's? Yup. Wow. Huh?
Who knows. Cause your brain guy,

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,740
he's the old shiny comes back.

52
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,470
We don't even know what John's
going to come back looking like.

53
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,970
The tide takes that much
time off and you know he's,

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,520
who knows either he's going
to come back better than ever.

55
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,180
Like Rory Macdonald looked and Bella tour.
Roy just needed rest though.

56
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,410
He's never looked like, you know
like Roy just need Resi rusted John.

57
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,800
He's a little cocoa, you
know, horror. Jeez. Hey pro

58
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,550
button ups and blazers talking about God,
I don't meet that.

59
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,450
I don't like that job. That's the OSP,
John. Those bullshit. You want that.

60
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,270
You want to relax John and
just doesn't devil may care.

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,480
I want the two day training camp.
John,

62
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,970
I wanted John to takes a flying knee for
his first opening movie going to show.

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,550
Yes,
he's 22 yes,

64
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,240
Britain does crazy elbows.
How about him?

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,420
Like bragging that he beat DC hi

66
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,560
coke a week before.
I don't think the best line of all time.

67
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,490
Best Line of all time. His career's
not going to be affected by that. No.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,530
Right now we are accepted. He's, oh he's
the bad pile. The flow. He's the bad guy.

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,670
He comes clean. Yeah. Be
that guy fucking love that.

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,500
It's always better if
you come clean period,

71
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,630
because you can smell fakeness from a
mile away would be turns into Conner

72
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,960
McGregor,
but on Coke beat that guy.

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,450
I just think if you,
if you're,

74
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,310
if you're caught up in the demon in the
demons and if you're completely honest

75
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,880
about it, Americans love you.
They forgive the Shit Outta you.

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,660
Charlie's Shit fucked up again.
Exactly.

77
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,620
Charlie Sheen is like the
best example that ever.

78
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:39,670
Well who the fuck ever
admitted to doing crack? Yeah,

79
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,660
like on a regular basis and talking about
how he does it. I, that's how I do it.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,000
That's how we roll and then he goes on,
it gets a TV deal for $900 million.

81
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:52,400
You're Robert Downey jr too.
Did he got the West TV? Yeah,

82
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,450
but he went to jail. He got cuffs
function. What's that raw iron man.

83
00:04:58,451 --> 00:04:59,650
It was fucking, he shoes. Really?

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,000
He's Robert Downey jr it seemed when
I was growing up was in the news.

85
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,760
You always saw him in court for something,
right?

86
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,760
Robert Downey Jr was always asking
him for forgiveness for being awesome.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,620
And then the judge
Robert Downey Jr is in court today.

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,150
He still mixing humongous Ironman.
Yeah,

89
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,780
we forgive drug problems easily.

90
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,730
It's when he got back he stuck movie
start with dudes who are drunks like an ex

91
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,420
cop and he gave up on life and he's just
a loser. He doesn't care about anybody.

92
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,950
Throws a pizza in a blender.

93
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,980
We root for Escobar.
When you watch,

94
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,760
when you watch narcos aren't
you kind of pulling forward?

95
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,910
You really want him to pull it out and

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,500
that's when you know somebody did their
job as a storyteller if you're at like,

97
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,360
it's like that's why science,

98
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,430
the lance was so genius because you
liked him and wanted him to be free cause

99
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,560
you were like, you know what he does,
he eat people but he wouldn't eat me.

100
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,840
Not only did everybody route for
Tony Montana, but what when I always,

101
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,060
anytime I would see that movie another
time I was hoping there would be some

102
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,350
kind of alternate ending.

103
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,410
I would always just leave
town to go back to your house.

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,540
Do you remember when, uh, we
will, uh, what's his face?

105
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,210
Is Larry David's show curb your
enthusiasm? Yes. Hear that crazy.

106
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:30,200
I had killer guy and he played, he
played in Scarface over his house. 24,

107
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:34,100
seven [inaudible] scarf.

108
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,690
He is 24, seven in his crib
and Rob Davis had Scarface.

109
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,350
Man. Scarface is a funny movie
and I know they're remaking it.

110
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,920
It's probably the first movie ever.
Would like an anti hero.

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,880
Was that the first one? Well No, not
the first one. The first big one.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,540
But like Clint Eastwood movies are kind
of like that, right? He wasn't, yeah.

113
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,690
Clinics. What? It was like the high plains
drifter. He was kind of a Ne'er do well,

114
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,220
came back,
but he would do good things.

115
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,700
You wouldn't do shitty
shit is never a douchebag.

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,040
But the guy came back to life though. The
Godfather was, that was a, yeah, that was,

117
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,120
which was the one where he came
back to life, was it high plains?

118
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,790
He knows high plains drifter.
He came,

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,600
they beat him and whipped him to death
and he came back to life control a hitman

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,010
and he came back. Well, I don't
know that that was the case,

121
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:25,220
but I know that when high plains or did
he take your shirt off and he's got all

122
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,440
these bullet marks and the guy goes,
but you're dead.

123
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,100
We did meet him once and he's supposed
to be like a ghost came back and killed

124
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,380
everybody maybe to see if that's the case.

125
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,350
Do you mean you know he's sure that was
high plains drifter storyline was that

126
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,100
he was like, he came back from the dead.
It was a different person. Different.

127
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,110
I'm pretty sure I love that movie.

128
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,010
I only know Clint Eastwood from his
current movies. That was always old.

129
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:50,060
She never saw the outlaw
Josey Wales over shit.

130
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,810
That movie stands the test
of time. Oh, I'm young.

131
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,830
I'm not the best clinics would moving
high plan. I mean, uh, uh, I love jazz.

132
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:01,160
Who else? Man? It's pretty
close though. It doesn't matter.

133
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,750
It cannot come out before our time.

134
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,100
Honestly it was like in 1970 or something
like that. If it came out now it would,

135
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,130
it would still killed. I don't
know too much about Clint Eastwood.

136
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,630
I wasn't really into Westerns,

137
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,420
but I know there's a bunch you
hear Joey talking about and stuff.

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I would be interested in and seeing a
documentary based on his career started.

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,110
It started with the good, the bad and
the ugly. It was the first I walk. Yeah.

140
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,440
And then how many did he
make after he made so many?

141
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,320
And here's the most of them in
Italy and more than that sheet what?

142
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,460
But here's the door call spaghetti
westerns because they were doing them in

143
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:35,330
Italy because they would,

144
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:38,520
they'd film in Italy and pretend
they were in New Mexico and she had

145
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,390
two of the most controversial
moments in movie history.

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Clint Eastwood one is he rapes a woman.

147
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,620
He straight up rapes are in a barn.
He just,

148
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,150
he just rips a girl and he's a hero.
He's a hero.

149
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,910
And then the second
movie was that Hawaiians

150
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,080
drifter to, nope, it was at
that point with no Douche
bag in the movie. What movie?

151
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,370
It was just him as he was. He was just
a man. Just come that he raped a girl,

152
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,070
she and then she falls in love with and
then she calls them loving them later.

153
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,360
Okay, how about this? Ready? What is
this called? Then he can look past,

154
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,390
look at this through they're
making them do something to do is

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,640
they always check my toenails.
If you've got to trim your toenails,

156
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,410
do with a fucking toenail clipper
and then file that shit down. John.

157
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,410
Mike Winkeljohn doesn't have a
fucking eyeball because of that.

158
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,030
That's not oh shit.
True.

159
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,380
That is something very serious and should
have been taken care of a long time

160
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,530
ago. If I was fighting this guy and I saw
that he was doing that to his toenails

161
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,740
right before a fight with his fingers, I'd
be like, fuck no. He's using a clipper.

162
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,270
He's, he's, it is up to the point. He
sit down, it's a file it down sharply,

163
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,020
just trimming it and then on top of it
he's going to do the other toe to the

164
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,771
reps going to do it.

165
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:50,760
Now imagine if he'd go to fucking
refaced trim and his toenails. Man,

166
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,910
he's serious. This is crazy.
He's very religious. They should,

167
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:57,360
but they should be polished.
You should sand those fuckers down.

168
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,600
I agree with condoms all the time.
Many condoms on about it.

169
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,870
They're really, look fingernails.
Fuck People's eyeballs up. You know,

170
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,900
that's a big part of what's
going on with these IPOs.

171
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,160
It's not just a blunt object. It's a blunt
object with a fucking hard edge to it.

172
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,340
[inaudible] he goes, well,
he got poked in the US,

173
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:20,190
all three Gustafson and then he goes,
what? They go, can you see goes? No,

174
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,720
but I will keep fighting the old cool.
They'll let them fight off.

175
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,190
So I'm glad that it stopped the fight
and he goes, it wouldn't matter though.

176
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,970
He had my time and use faster, but
you know he had everything. Well,

177
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:32,180
if he couldn't see out of one eye,
that was,

178
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,640
he was getting beat up before that though.
But he did say he goes it,

179
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,270
it wouldn't matter. What
does it say? Jeremy?

180
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,320
I plains drifter had their rape and I
can't quite tell if this is the one,

181
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,080
how did the guys say?
Yeah,

182
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:46,850
that was the one of the reasons why he
got away with it because he was this guy

183
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:51,620
coming back from the dead. Well, what
is the, what is the, what's the premise?

184
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,920
So is that, uh, this at the
beginning of attractive towns,

185
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,180
woman deliberately bumps into him
in the street and Oxys to golf?

186
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,580
No, no, no, no. I don't mean
the premise of the rape. I mean,

187
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:03,910
the premise of the movie, I, it doesn't
really have, it's a long plot here. Okay.

188
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,370
Five paragraphs is insanely controversial.
He May,

189
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,450
there's a girl, she's about eight,
maybe younger. She saves him from a,

190
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,360
he's a union soldier. She saves him from
the confederate soldiers. He saves life.

191
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,570
She says, no, he's not here. And he
looks at her and cause he said, look,

192
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:27,370
he turns and kisses her on the lips
for about five seconds. How about that?

193
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,170
Oh yeah. More than that. It's, it's
like, you're like what? I mean,

194
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,110
they've got to witness on shit.
Yeah. But by the way, no, no.

195
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,270
It was a different movie and he in this,
he wasn't,

196
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,340
you knew he wasn't like a pedophile.

197
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,180
He was just so happy that his life had
been spared that you could never get away

198
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:47,080
with that. I probably shouldn't
it movies, but you know,

199
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,820
the 70s really crazy. It's like how
much culture has changed since 1970 yup.

200
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,580
How much humans have changed?
It's true.

201
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,900
I feel like Paulo here could rave or go
and get away with in the movies. I mean,

202
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,320
he is a dime pays and good luck on this.
Good fight before. No, it was a monster.

203
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,530
Yeah, he's very good. He's, he's
part pronounce his last name.

204
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,020
That's going to be tough.
You're asking the wrong gentleman here.

205
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,410
He's built like a, like a
speech. Congratulations.

206
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,690
What is a d? Jamie? See if you can
find the pronunciation of his name,

207
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
what we'll hear it from Brian Stann.

208
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,640
There's things that you
can do anymore nowadays,

209
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,800
but there's things now that you
couldn't do back then. Like,

210
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,890
Shit seems to be slipping into TV every
now and then and maybe a fuck after 10.

211
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,400
There's no, they're starting to
look at this. Did you see the lanes?

212
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:37,420
They were talking shit that to separate
them. Wow. Can I ask you guys a question?

213
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,600
Uh, who were in the know, I know
that you saw that is very strict,

214
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,920
but if you're in Brazil,
are you, uh, are, is there

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,070
literally just asked him a shingle
analysis? Let's say his name. Let's see.

216
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,260
What do you think of?
His name is Gina. Gina,

217
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,840
Gina, Gina, Gina,

218
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,420
and then his name is Olu la.
My mind,

219
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,870
I think it's been both. I think he's from
Nigeria. That's my guess. I think. Yeah,

220
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,730
let's hear it. Let's hear it. Give
me some volume. It'd be hilarious.

221
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,690
Flux and stuff. Oh, that's
here. I can't hear my,

222
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,030
here we go.
Let's hear the names a little louder.

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,190
Just all

224
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,580
Boshea bamboo. Bamboo shade.
Okay. Now listen to this

225
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,220
great fights.

226
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,050
That means drunk,

227
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,180
drunk chick or little drunk dude. Yeah.

228
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,213
For a cheap

229
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,390
drunk because I bet you this fight
doesn't get out of the first round, Jovan.

230
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,430
For Real. I don't think so.
The way the homeboy fights,

231
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,410
how much volume can we have
and still really what happens?

232
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,150
I mean the sound would get in
the, in the feed. Oh, okay. Right.

233
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,070
Then we get pulled on to
June's this Goddamn Youtube,

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,920
youtube bunch of your hazers.
Somebody's exposed to swinging.

235
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,940
He said somebody is explosive.
Yeah, because he's black.

236
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,960
I said somebody, Bro, don't ever put
words in my mouth and we'll he the black.

237
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,910
I didn't do anything but wow,
he's explosive. I didn't say that.

238
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,500
That was a stereotype of Mexicans.

239
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,270
When you're watching two
guys fight like this,

240
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:52,160
when you're watching two fight like this,
there's so

241
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,530
tense.
You know these guys are like,

242
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,140
when you have a bunch of bad
blood between two guys like you,

243
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:03,440
you can almost like see it in how like
wound up and pulled back. They are.

244
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,360
They also don't have a lot of
experience though either Joe.

245
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,510
Like it's only homeboys second fight.
She's kept up,

246
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,190
they cut the shit out of his back.
Yup. Does that work? Brian? What is it?

247
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:16,190
What's going on? On my personally, don't
believe it was on my knee. That worked.

248
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,160
How did it work? What did it do it I
had all like this bad blood in there.

249
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:23,540
That wasn't a bad circulating and it
literally got it out. It was like dark.

250
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,770
The healer. That might be some bullshit.
I call it placebo. Wait a minute.

251
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,690
You mean it got it out? How
does it get it out? It leaped.

252
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,270
They poke holes in your name and
put the suction. It sucks. The, Oh,

253
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,260
they cite the stagnant blood.
Yo, look at this high back mount.

254
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,040
He's getting a little sloppy there. You
just go a little too wild. Yeah, but he's,

255
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,780
he's attacking [inaudible]. We just
barely missed that. Left to her.

256
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,150
You can't lose guys.
He's getting loose jacked.

257
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,640
They are both six fellow you see on
the beach, uh, shed the black fellow,

258
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,020
the Brazilian. They both look like
beach boys. A couple of peach,

259
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,230
couple of beach bullies. I was talking
about the Brazilian character though.

260
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:04,640
He looks like some dude coming out of
the water with a speedo on for Dior.

261
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,550
Super uncomfortable about being
on the beach with my shirt off.

262
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,130
I go and run my Keto ass away.

263
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,590
I don't think he's a kid.
I just think he's a nice side light kick.

264
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:16,870
Great kick bamboo shit.

265
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,750
Bomb Boucher is those John Joan legs.
These things are dangerous. He's very,

266
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,510
very stiff for this upper [inaudible].
We just get head kicked.

267
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,350
He throws back shots and he's getting it.
Bamboos it looks a little tired guys.

268
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,190
Yeah. We're only two minutes in. Right?
That's being all tight and wound up.

269
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,700
I mean these guys got to catch their
second wind and I see him pacing moving

270
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,060
like at like nothing smooth.
It's all fucking moving.

271
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,780
A lot of looking to spin
from him a couple of times.

272
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,960
Both Guy Bam. Bamboozles
Hey Glenn, I think he's

273
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,530
going to lose when he throws it's big.

274
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,600
It's just waits for a shot. Yep. He's not
fucking around. He throws big shit. Yeah.

275
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,430
It's whether or not he
can sustain this style.

276
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,250
Dominick Cruz,
he was like,

277
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,990
he keeps switching stances.
Oh, tag. Yeah. But I mean he's,

278
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,790
he's obviously not as fluid as Donald. We
know what that, that uh, he looked at us,

279
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,290
glanced on heat though.
They're both drawn. He,

280
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,170
these guys are two dudes who don't
really like each other. Oh, okay. Oh boy.

281
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,540
Keeps looking at the blog or just
as crazy as I can't tell. Oh,

282
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,000
he's getting hurt while shit now.
Yeah.

283
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,110
Let's go board,
cheat and go and get bamboozled.

284
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,330
That's kind of smart.
Oh Gosh.

285
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,950
It was worried about the bodies when
we have a body now with the punches.

286
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,750
Each stroke I shot his first fight he got,

287
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,570
he's like Roberto Duran,

288
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,190
Duran Duran and Dominick Cruz.

289
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,850
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm
talking about now the Brazilian.

290
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh God. God. God.

291
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,920
God. Fight. Oh my God. The dread. Okay.

292
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,840
Chance presenter. Rans boxing.

293
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:29,010
It's like some of the best ever.
God knows the body shots

294
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,970
and that's who you are.
Cesar Chavez right there.

295
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,170
I couldn't drop that mark on his,
the inside of his, neither on,

296
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:40,560
on a Buddhist Sheena's knee and that's
how I rolled the yard. But I seen that.

297
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,520
I don't think that's
the right way to say it.

298
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,020
Well when chewing it like you're
in France or something, but

299
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,820
he didn't fuck. Yeah, I don't think books.

300
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:56,400
Can you come and take your Brazilian
accent for just a little while?

301
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,070
He's going to wild for me. You
know, but I'm going to try now.

302
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,050
That guy's going to go look at,
whoa. Oh, oh. Control the posture.

303
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,700
Posture Yourself. No, that guys,

304
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,560
because I was in France

305
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,510
because I was in Jamaica
then I was in France,

306
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,490
but I'm from Brazil.
Control position. Come on,

307
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,220
let him off posture. Very good
posture. While the first round guys,

308
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:32,020
he's having tried to walk
Mullin, Dude, he's wobbling.
He is fucking wobbling. Yeah,

309
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,950
and he pointed,
he came up to Jesus.

310
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:38,951
He's just going to help them to be this
dude's fucking oxygen to board she and

311
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:43,650
had just poured it on, man.
Are you going at this point?

312
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,090
You know what? The black dudes
and shape, yeah. Oh look.

313
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,760
You can be built and still have endurance.

314
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,680
I mean when Tim Kennedy with his at his
best, he was always built like a tank.

315
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,540
Never got tied to good
endurance. Yeah. Was He shredded?

316
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,470
Look at those Strikeforce days, both of
them shred city, but it's a fine line.

317
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,150
It's a fine line.

318
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:10,230
Like you get too much mass and not enough
conditioning and you work too much on

319
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:13,380
explosion in the fight and
not enough on technique.

320
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,900
Not Enough on pacing yourself.
He's got a giant,

321
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:19,290
she'll look at the Anthony Joshua.
He's shred shredded city,

322
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,730
240 pounds to 40 and and came back,
you know,

323
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,940
got draw lines almost and then came
back a track and the next round he got,

324
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,590
he dropped Klitschko and
then Klitschko dropped.

325
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,290
That's when he dropped Klitschko
twice in the final round.

326
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,280
Upper cuts were caused by the way, I think
it was a controversial stoppage. Boy,

327
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,400
that guy's built. Holy Shit.
Or Chino. It's the shoulders

328
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,240
stacked. Yeah, he is
man. Yeah, we'll just,

329
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,820
we'll just toss it up. Just go ahead and
let's definitely, I got amazing. Know.

330
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,430
That's what I'm saying.
That's all minutes.

331
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,010
Cause you know that golden snitches
sniffing around these two like go fucking,

332
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,340
he's young and he's got that mesomorphic
structure. It doesn't look out of place.

333
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,360
The hard place to hide. I know he
doesn't look like no one would be

334
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,070
facetious.
I don't know what I'm saying.

335
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,370
I'm not accusing me
double front shot anybody.

336
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,010
[inaudible] tour on the car tonight. We're
going to find out what the fuck is up.

337
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,000
What is he going to look like?
He tore it gets Nate Marquardt.

338
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,550
Both of them have dabbled
in iron man boulder. Yeah,

339
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,460
I'm going to make a deal.
They got to say, listen,

340
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,260
I'm going to let my sister be for me.

341
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,930
He just kicked dropout bombs. Now
it's going to be bad. Real bad.

342
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,670
Eddie, what was that club? Not really
tired and I didn't see the fight,

343
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,500
but how did it go aboard?
Chino put gets us. Eddie.

344
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,270
What was that MMA fight that you posted
on your Instagram or someone was gone

345
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,980
for the heel hook be trippin.
Oh Shit.

346
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,120
What was that MMA fight you post on your
Instagram today where someone was going

347
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,640
for the heel hook.
That was earlier today.

348
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,590
I was in the and the other dude is beating
the shit out of him while he's gone

349
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:06,490
for the healer within the minute. Ran
Out. Who won that fight? Matthew Lopez,

350
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,240
the guy on top, the guy that's
throwing bombs, Brazilian,

351
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,470
I forget the Brazilians name.

352
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,520
So the Brazilian was a cat that
was going for the heel hook, Tim.

353
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,860
That was a battle. Yeah, I put them
right on 55th tough. And he had,

354
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:22,730
when he had the, he had it, he
had it, but he held on and uh,

355
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,290
Matthew Lopez used to dealing
with heel hooks all the time.

356
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,100
Great Wrestler and oppressive defense.
Oh Man. Because he got the death's door.

357
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,880
You got to death's door a couple of times.
Yeah.

358
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,520
Real good defect but damn hammer fist
from hell. And that's the danger.

359
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,990
And go to the leg locks and they work.
They weren't,

360
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,340
but some of the times you're going to
get smashed. Jamie's got to play it.

361
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:43,910
Look it up there.
We get up there on the left.

362
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,550
I mean this is like his clothes he got
goddamn he'll hook is you're going to get

363
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,010
this dude's jacket on it and Yanking
on it and homeboy Matthew Lopez a bad

364
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:57,280
motherfucker. Cause he was in pain
here for sure. And he survived.

365
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:01,180
Look at this thing. Top Kid,
man. Oh yeah, right here.

366
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,330
They shouldn't allow a head kicks with
the fuck. Fuck. You should be able to.

367
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,870
It said,

368
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,630
why could you kick someone in the head
standing up and you can't kick someone to

369
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:14,890
head on the ground? It makes zero
sense. It's a viable move as spelling.

370
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,080
If you want to say to the guy standing up,

371
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,930
can't soccer kick the guy in the head
or stopped him in the head? Okay.

372
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,350
We can argue that because the cage,
because he can't go, I can't go anywhere,

373
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,540
but you can't argue that if
they're in that position,

374
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,880
the guy's going for a heel hook.
They're both on the ground.

375
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:31,030
You should absolutely be able to kick
just like you could accidentally elbow to

376
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:33,910
the head. You get punched in the head.
Yeah. Why can't you kick to that?

377
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,040
It makes zero sense. Zero upkick
should be legal now you're percent,

378
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,680
you're on your back.
Might be too hard.

379
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,070
It's too hard.
It's too

380
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,760
hard.
You can hit a guy with a wheel cake,

381
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,960
but you can't up kick them when you're
on your back and he's trying to close in

382
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,710
on you. Fuck that. You should be able
to go crazy. You should be able to,

383
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:58,430
with the guys on his knees, you should
be able to kick them to knees. One knee,

384
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,760
you should be able to kick the shit out
of him if you're on your back and I was

385
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,570
in Singapore and I hung
out with shots tree.

386
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,500
The guy who owns evolve any owns one of
scene or the guy who owns evolve owns

387
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:12,260
one FC as well. Yeah, one championship,

388
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,440
and I swear I've been doing,
I've been to a thousand UFC investors.

389
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,870
I never been to an event like
this. Really? Dude, hey bro,

390
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,210
you won championship as far
as production goes and ha,

391
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,580
fuck. Really doing English Clemente
high level English commentary for them,

392
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,790
it's the most incredible,
it's like month,

393
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,370
like this VIP section was just the
way it was all set up. Let's just,

394
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,490
let's just spend, there's no
budget. It was incredible.

395
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,600
Every fighter,

396
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,900
every finder that came out had
its own music video and own show.

397
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,230
They really go off.

398
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,780
I'm promoting the each individual fighter.

399
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,130
Each guy came out and he had his own
music video, his own song cut up.

400
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,530
Who's the big stars were there
besides his ass to star over there.

401
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,750
Ask them is a huge stuff dude,
that guy has some of this.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,010
She's my way.
So that's

403
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,370
the reason I bring it up.

404
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:20,170
Joe Is I was talking with them and
I asked you a fucking goat cheese.

405
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,370
I said he was going from close going
back and forth on the rules like it cause

406
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:29,500
they allowed soccer kicks initially.
You see Brandon, very soccer kid.

407
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,630
Eventually he said we
got to pull them out.

408
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,740
You know there was a couple really exactly
know,

409
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,410
but it's his decision.
He doesn't have a commission.

410
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:40,580
He could do whatever he wants.

411
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,010
So to him it's up to him
and he decided to pull the,

412
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:49,011
the soccer kicks but out we and all kicks
on the ground and I said he included

413
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,280
up kicks and he goes,
well technically yes,

414
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,290
but he thought about it for a
second or maybe he allowed him,

415
00:25:56,291 --> 00:26:00,200
maybe I'm a little confused
but as to what he said.

416
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,120
But he agreed at the end of the
conversation that upkick should be legal.

417
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,140
I mean you're on your back and
you allow a wheel commission,

418
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,400
you 100% should be able to
upkick at anytime with the
guard says one knee on the

419
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:17,030
ground to knees to the ground. No knees
on the ground to gray on your back.

420
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,440
You should be able to
get back to your feet.

421
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:22,820
It's a viable technique
and the guy shouldn't be so
confident that he can close

422
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:23,990
the distance.
Okay.

423
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,170
The only reason he is so confident that
he can close the distance and get get

424
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,440
ahold of you is because you can't kick
up kick them when you have one knee down.

425
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,210
Right.
It's a bullshit strategy.

426
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,570
What's it bolsters strategy based
on a bullshit safety. So Eddie,

427
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,770
there's no commission out there.

428
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,720
Now he's got everyone going sizzler
and he calls him crazy. But I,

429
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,160
like I said,
I've never been to a show like that.

430
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,440
I mean damn all the way you sold me Bro.

431
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,460
Do you guys think this one dude shot tree?

432
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:53,550
He's the man that gentlemen.

433
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,210
It's like he just wants the best show.
He's uh,

434
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,660
he's half Thai, half Japanese. Who a is.

435
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,940
Does the commentary for
English does rich Franklin,

436
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,240
rich Franklin just moved there to work
for him. I said they pay some rich,

437
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,074
rich Franklin.

438
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,140
Ben Aspirin wants to move there and his
shots was just move to Singapore and

439
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,030
worked for one FC. Holy Shit. He's done
buddy. But great thinking about retiring,

440
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,480
asking us, thinking about us, thinking
about our time never gets to the UFC.

441
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:24,810
That's such a fucking shame.
Yeah, that guy's an animal, man.

442
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,940
I can't see you and
beat our jam right now.

443
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,810
Do you guys think that you should job,
do you think it should be illegal to be,

444
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:35,070
if you're inside control Geneva head
hundred percent really when you're on your

445
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,980
hand, and we should be able to, don't
be in that position. Right? If you,

446
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:40,500
if you know,
if you guy can get you inside control,

447
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,910
you should be fucking
scrambling like a wild cat.

448
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,070
And if you're not scrambling like a
wildcat, it means you're compromised.

449
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,390
And if you're compromised,

450
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,110
they means you either got too tired or
you got to hurt and that guy should be

451
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,720
able to capitalize a need of
the head when you're down.

452
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,320
The only time it's a problem in my
eyes is when you can't move your head.

453
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,760
That's why pride was superior in that
respect because they had those ropes so

454
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,730
you can go on to the ropes and avoid
soccer kicks. You could avoid stomps,

455
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:06,564
you could avoid knees.

456
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,190
The only argument against soccer kicks
and stomps and knees to the head is the

457
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,620
fucking cage. Getting your head pressed
up against the cage and getting stuck.

458
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,590
In my opinion,
that makes it a problem because you can't,

459
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:18,300
the guy can't get out
of the way of a strike,

460
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:22,860
so then the artificial boundaries of
the cage becomes a weapon. It becomes,

461
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,090
obviously you can strategize
to get the fuck away from it.

462
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,590
Don't let it happen to you. If it does
happen to you, it's very dangerous.

463
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,740
It makes fights more exciting because
there's more opportunities for chaos,

464
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,180
but you're going to shortened careers.

465
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,770
I have a different point of view on it
in that I don't think that when you don't

466
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,450
have knees to the head,

467
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,740
we in San position are when your hands
are on the ground or for example,

468
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,130
soccer kicks. I don't think it
makes, if you added those things,

469
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:50,760
I would do think of a do two things.
It would not make the sport more exciting,

470
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,300
but it would make it more brutal and
it would probably shortened careers.

471
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,330
So in my opinion, I, it's brutal
enough and has enough technique to,

472
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,070
I know, but to not allow certain like, but
things, so I think more brood. I, yeah,

473
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,410
I've kicked her different story and I
was thinking that he's trying to rip your

474
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:11,500
knee off and you can kick them like from
that position. I think that's the luck.

475
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,570
Yeah,

476
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,650
you could break somebody's allowed brains
if they got their head cut caught in a

477
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:20,850
bad spot and you actually stomp on it
100% can you imagine just Brock Lesnar?

478
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,210
Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well listen man,

479
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,980
I didn't match exactly.

480
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,000
Also asking him, I asked him about, I go,

481
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,790
what if a fighter wants to wear
spat like or irrational anyway,

482
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,680
rash guard. And whose decision is that?
It goes, my decision. I go, so Kiddo.

483
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,070
I mean women were rash guards all
the time. It's never a problem in a,

484
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,070
in an MMA fight. It's never like what
do we do with the wounds? Rash guards,

485
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,650
we can't have them fight topless.
What are we going to do?

486
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,110
It just like you just swear
rash guard. No, but no big
deal. There shouldn't be uh,

487
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,450
uh, you know, a rule prohibiting fighters,

488
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,210
male fighters from wearing
rash guards in my opinion.

489
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,770
I mean it's not a big deal for women.
Why, you know, and he, he agreed,

490
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,570
he said he would let anybody wearing
anything cause you want to wear a geek and

491
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,290
one FC. You can wear a geek. You can work
at Kido pants if you want. In one FC.

492
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,680
I think you should be able to wear jeans.
And I think you should tell him no,

493
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,580
no gloves and gloves. If you can
need something in the head, elbows,

494
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:23,740
someone in the face, you can kick them
in the head with your fucking Shin.

495
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,120
My Shin is so much less
vulnerable than my hand.

496
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,290
No, but take away the paddle and the
knuckles. If you're going to have padding,

497
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,990
we should have padding on the shins.
We should have padding on the knuckles.

498
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,650
We should have absolute patting on the
heel cause the heels the most dangerous

499
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:44,140
in my opinion because I
could wheel kick something.

500
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,460
You could hit something really hard. It
doesn't really hurt your heel. Right?

501
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,570
But you get,
you punch someone in the head.

502
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,540
You have a really good chance if you
hit the forehead of breaking your hand.

503
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,990
I've never heard of a guy we'll kick
and grind ahead and hurting his foot.

504
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,750
I mean, I've hurt my foot to
the point where I was limping,

505
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,400
but I didn't hurt my foot. I never broke
it. It was like our we, but that was our,

506
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:06,410
we office someone's fucking
head. Right. You know like the,

507
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,580
the idea that you could pat up your
knuckles, you don't pat of your heel.

508
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,590
It's crazy. Your heels. A goddamn hammer.
I mean t, what's that dude's name?

509
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,280
There's a dude who just
fought in Bellator recently.

510
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,370
I'm going to pull this up because I
told this kid I would give him props,

511
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,100
but he'd knocked out somebody
with an ax kick. I saw that as my

512
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,670
background. Might be the
only time ever. Hey Joe.

513
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,030
It was after the main card
though, right? Like he was the,

514
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,140
he was on either before the card
or after the main car doors do.

515
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,830
So there'll be the main event and then
it's over TV and then we'll have guys

516
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:42,910
fight after. Yeah, like one or two
guys fight after. Okay, homeboy.

517
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,740
His name is Eric Davis.
Yeah,

518
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,690
Alfie are Davis.

519
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,230
Alfie Art Davis and he
acts kicked Kudzu acts.

520
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:57,550
He acts kicked a dude and and which sweat
this dome. Oh wait a minute. Go again.

521
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,580
Back it up again. Here we go.
Watch this. Oh no way. Come on.

522
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,160
Told you someone was going to do that
eventually. Cause that's happened.

523
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:10,260
I've seen that happen.
And [inaudible] Hook kick.

524
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,440
That's what I want to see if that, I don't
think Derrick, the black beast Louis.

525
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,950
No, that wasn't, that one wasn't, that
wasn't Bella. I, but I do just for answer.

526
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,180
But Derrick Lewis got knocked out by
Sean Jordan with a front leg hook kick.

527
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,980
Get the fuck out of that. Sean
Jordan, who's 250 pounds, 260

528
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,300
shithouse British bulldog but
can do backflips whack. Yeah.

529
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:35,710
Shall I draw back Lsu Hook kick front
leg bill Wallace. That's awesome.

530
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,610
Style Shin Shun join was a freak. He's
freak athlete. Here it is. Here it is.

531
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,230
Oh, what? Yeah, that was actually,

532
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,310
it looks like you brought it
from the back of that. Yeah.

533
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,410
And it looked like it was almost a
sidekick. Right? Let's say it again. Boom.

534
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,620
It's definitely a hook now. You're
right. I'll show it in slow motion.

535
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:59,360
You see the hooking? It could
be a shitty sidekick. Yes.

536
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,120
In cause I mean look at it.
No,

537
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,150
it's a straight up hook kick from karate.

538
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,580
Karate back. Boom. I mean, that's amazing.

539
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,380
It Derek's like why even though you
don't train for that as a heavyweight,

540
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,580
he's a crazy athlete. Football
background, football. Yet.

541
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:24,410
We're supposed to go to the NFL,
flip 250 pounds full backflip. Ooh,

542
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,320
five should I be built like a,
like just a troll,

543
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,010
like the thing from a fantastic guy.

544
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,730
They said he was going to
UCLA as a fullback or whenever
he was and he was that

545
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:35,990
big and he was dunking a basketball.

546
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:39,440
He's just standing there and just jumping
in and going. I was like, what the fuck?

547
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,880
Shut Sean. Jordan was supposed to go to
the NFL, but he got caught with some uh,

548
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,690
Brazilian supplements crossing the
border and then it fell. It was like,

549
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:51,440
we're good. Go. We're all set.
Yeah. Oopsies he's a freak though.

550
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,560
You got to send those in the mail side
named Mark Courses. Same. We get a bugs.

551
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,670
You get over stuffed animal animal teddy
bears to a sick care of your buddies

552
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:06,080
up. Nothing to lose. Put up their ass.
Come on. What are you doing tomorrow?

553
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,400
Listen, you still have student
loans. It's time to become a Buell

554
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,640
time to become a mule.
I hope Nate wins.

555
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,530
If like if one day in the future you
have 100% transparency and you get to see

556
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,920
all the crimes that are committed all
across the one how many times per day or

557
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:28,130
dudes coming across the border with
drugs up there ass. Oh my God, my God,

558
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,740
I got him a mass right now. I've been
offered a few. What's the number though?

559
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,880
A hundred a day and more
play more thousand a day.

560
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,490
A couple of dudes do that day
got caught going through Kennedy,

561
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:42,650
I think with coke taped
all over their body

562
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,310
to the bullet up randomly.
Touchdown man.

563
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:52,220
That's a big risk to plus the,

564
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,680
but I think dogs can only smell one thing.
And they usually use them for bombs.

565
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,950
No, because with a drug
dogs though, they can smell,

566
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,650
you know he'll have with drug dogs,
but don't,

567
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,350
that motherfucker did a good job.

568
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:13,850
That's very smart and good job on your
ass. You know what he should've done?

569
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,450
He should've got it shaped like one of
those Batman suits where all the muscles

570
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:21,380
are like he's intentionally
do it. Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:24,550
But he's in deep shit. Guy's going
to jail. He's going to give, Ooh,

572
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,960
look at that vagina. Cain. Cocaine.
Pretty giant. A giant. Wow.

573
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,050
That's looks like it's a butterball.
That pitch has a big pussy. Yes. Well,

574
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,970
I feel sick now.
Once you've had a few kids,

575
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:38,040
I guess you could probably get a Turkey
in there. It's cool to us play that makes

576
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,640
them feel safe. Six kids, half
a pound. That's impressive.

577
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,000
Christ and her veggies.
Think about what Gil Kane,

578
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,990
if you pack it tight,
isn't it like a rock?

579
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,720
Half a pound might only
be like a fist big tube,

580
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,840
but might be giving this gal
more credit than she deserves.

581
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:57,660
Look at the size of that fucking thing
and the thing is almost always the saying

582
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,960
this. Tell me, Oh perspective. Now it's
almost as thick as my cock. If you look,

583
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,980
it could be a pill. Oh, look at veto.
Coming out for the last time. Maybe.

584
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,180
What if veto like,

585
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,170
I mean he's only got one more
fight left in his contract.

586
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:13,220
He thought this was the last fight
and then he was going to leave. Yeah,

587
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,460
you fucked up. He didn't count.
Right? Not a good sign. And then, uh,

588
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,520
one of the other things you said
recently that was crazy, he's like,

589
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:24,690
he wants to make UFC bigger than Uber
and everyone was like, hey homie,

590
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,340
Uber is crashing right now.

591
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,900
If you understand like the
amount of punishment that
Uber's taking online. Huge.

592
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,620
$300 million million dollar
loss. First quarter. Yeah.

593
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,110
All sorts of controversies
attached to Uber. Like what?
Oh, that's a good question.

594
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,340
The CFO to their final button, a bunch
of people that's a little bit troubles,

595
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:49,080
but they'll come back. Uber. Yeah.
But it's just a weird time. Uber,

596
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,090
the actual idea and the service didn't
work out or is it, was it just bad?

597
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,890
That's a good question. I
don't know what, you know,

598
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,980
I looked at it peripherally like I
saw like, oh, Uber's in trouble again.

599
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,550
Uber's of the new president
has said some shit that they,

600
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:06,450
they've lost a lot of money and that
helps lift. Yeah. That Lyft is, um,

601
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,810
the new version. Right. That's
what a lot of people use.

602
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,720
It's like the 99 cent store for Uber.
It's kind of funny.

603
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,800
I know uses Uber and it's awesome.

604
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,040
You ever fucking fucked up Uber
Pool and accident and people share.

605
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,700
There's like six people in the car damage.
You were trying to save money.

606
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:27,360
I'm like, I just did on accident cause
it automatically goes to it and I'm like,

607
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,230
what the fuck? I'll just fucking
wait other people's houses.

608
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,760
I got an Uber for my friend and uh, he
was gonna, he was going into my podcast.

609
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:39,780
So I'm watching him from his house and
I'm watching the car doing all these

610
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:42,630
fucking terms like flexible Victorians.
Jesus Christ,

611
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,430
you'll be towards crazy pucks flexible.
He's just doing standing splits. Oh yeah.

612
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,670
He's a fucking athlete, man. Oh
my God. One of the greats, man.

613
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,650
If this guy never had a
chemical controversy, you know
what I mean? If we, if we,

614
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:58,800
we had a frozen time machine from 1997
on and you've got it all dialed in.

615
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,070
He bought one of the
grace of all teachers,

616
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,130
the one that he's one of the
ones that got caught. Yes.

617
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,060
That's what I think for sure.

618
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:10,320
But he's also an interesting
case Vittorias in that, you know,

619
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,340
he's had like these spectacular victories
and then also some really brutal

620
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:19,341
defeats and his spectacular victories
are very rare because he's a sprinter.

621
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,250
He attacks you in sprints at you,
which a lot of people don't do.

622
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,690
Like v Torches Dean's you a little peek
a little bit and then he sprints back in

623
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:31,710
the day. It has. He ever doesn't
work these days. Guys know it, right?

624
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,550
I don't know. See, didn't the
TRT, it absolutely worked,

625
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:41,180
but he's also 40 right, so it's like every
bit of man. Like what is [inaudible]?

626
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,590
There's a,

627
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,590
there's something to be said for the
strategy of your heard a guy in MMA,

628
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:48,220
you have little gloves on
and he just fucking swarm
him. But you're going all in,

629
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,360
all chips in.
Has He ever been down?

630
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,110
Has He ever been down and come
back? That's a question. Yes.

631
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
When Anthony Rumble Johnson, you got
fucked up. I rumble Johnson in Brazil,

632
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:00,731
rumbled,

633
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:04,360
didn't even make one 85 rumble was way
over one 85 this was back when rumble

634
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:09,361
went up from one 70 to one 85 didn't
even make one 85 put a beaten on veto and

635
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:14,280
then ran out again. Ah, ah.

636
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,510
Yeah. Who else choked rumble out
to people? Forget about, ah, yeah.

637
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,230
Rich Clemente motherfucker school.
How about that?

638
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:27,820
Rich [inaudible] who used to fight at
55 that was, that was that young, dumb,

639
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,800
crazy.
You know what?

640
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,650
It was 100% he cut too much
weight and he couldn't sustain it.

641
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,800
When we did warrior,
he was kind of,

642
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,950
he was walking around at two 35 to
35 I remember asking him, I said,

643
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:41,760
you're a giant. And I said, you're
going to suck down on one 70 I go,

644
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,410
how are you gonna do? And he goes, I'll
make it. And he did such a mad idea, man.

645
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,040
I think that's one of the
reasons why five pounds,

646
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:52,360
he had this bad feeling about MMA
in the first place. Yeah. You know,

647
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:54,310
when he says he doesn't like
fighting him and make Jesus Christ,

648
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,640
you're one of the top two fucking
light heavy weights on the planet.

649
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,410
Top two or three. I mean,
rumbled beat him. I mean a DC
beat him the last time. Oh,

650
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,790
there's these two spectrums.
Brown's time. Awesome. Vito Belfort,

651
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:11,791
four 50 54544503452 couple of
veterans than sink earlier.

652
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,590
And for those who don't know,

653
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Brendan Schaub density trained with Nate
Marquardt back in the day and you said

654
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:26,800
you never saw him lose around. Never,
never. And you know realize right it.

655
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,740
And they trained together too
for the rumble Johnson camp.

656
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,940
We all flew out there to
help you so that you know,

657
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,720
they know each other a little bit
and they're also Jesus' brothers.

658
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:36,350
If you don't know that you're there,

659
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,770
they're also brothers and we're going
to see who Jesus likes the most.

660
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:42,610
And this fight when Nate is Wilkin
quite thick. Yes, he is strong as shit.

661
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,690
Nate is a freak athlete, man.
Yep. Super Freak. He's awesome.

662
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,750
If I since he was 17 it's almost like
Nate just just missed the time periods.

663
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,610
You know, like if Nate in his prime,
whoa. Nate is coming strong here man.

664
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:00,790
He looks very confident. He
looks very fast too, man.

665
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,860
Beautiful trip.
Vito Vito Vitorin his back is not good.

666
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,120
This is not good except against Jon Jones
against Jon Jones. Jon was slacking,

667
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,290
left his arm out there and [inaudible]
pulled off the rare armbar off his back

668
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:18,940
and hopped on his arm.
That fight too much.

669
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,170
Sorry.
No,

670
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:23,560
you look at veto with the elbow from
the bottom was actually a very strong

671
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,330
people asleep on h Jitsu too.

672
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:30,010
He's a legit black moon widget and
he's a fucking strong dude too.

673
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:34,310
And if you could hold Vito here and beat
him up and he's doing aggressive shit

674
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,250
too, like you sticking, it's
fucking to see old Nate man.

675
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,710
It's such a smart move by Nate.
Cause veto or like you said,

676
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,020
he's only dangerous than the first.
Really the first round.

677
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,940
After that he tailors off so bad. So
for Nate, this and the sec around,

678
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:50,420
I bet he tico. Wow. Especially
the Vituro of today.

679
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,060
That's what I'm saying. His,
his testosterone levels.

680
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:56,750
He says her super depleted and
he's got a real problem and yeah,

681
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,100
I mean it's a weird argument, right?
I mean, why are they depleted?

682
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,520
You're only 40 you don't stand them up.
It's a dominant position.

683
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,710
That's terrible. Fuck you. It's Brazil,
Bro. We want to see people bang. Yeah,

684
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:12,830
but that's terrible. They're doing it
because it's Brazil. Yeah, that's right.

685
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:16,200
I mean mean mean. I don't know
how many warnings he gave him. Oh,

686
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,290
we're not listening to the commentary.
Well,

687
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,710
he's trying to move vittores tighten them
up. We know. It looks like to me here,

688
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,500
it looks like Nate is like
super confident coming in here.

689
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:30,250
This is a like a Nate who
knows his opponent and feels
real good that about his

690
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:33,950
chances. He looks confident. He
doesn't like tentative at all.

691
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,013
Mad Skinny.

692
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,550
He knows he's Vito or just
physically does not look that good.

693
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,010
He told us just waiting for that one.
Like,

694
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,250
look at the look at the excess body weight
around his waist and his legs look of

695
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,470
consistent 40 though gap,
but

696
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,010
fires away that I'm 50 and I don't
have that. And by the way he's,

697
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,010
his endocrine system is probably a
little bit, you know, compromise.

698
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,540
Well that's what I'm saying. Yeah,
100% yeah. He also, Oh shit. Get away.

699
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,400
I just dripped. Oh this way. You can't
caught that one to the body to go rough.

700
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,480
But I mean he caught it on his elbows.
Fucking scroll. Front leg side,

701
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:14,420
kick to the leg. I love that kick
and it's got some treks kids.

702
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,570
I love that people are doing that now.
That's a legit technique.

703
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:20,480
You know the people think
that it's damaging to the
name. You think it's dirty.

704
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,740
What about heel hooks? Look, it's a
good technique. If you can kick the leg,

705
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,500
that's a good way to kick the leg.
And what are we doing here?

706
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,470
You could blow a guy's knee out with a,
with a regular tie kick.

707
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,060
I can't believe that's even a debate.
I can't believe it is.

708
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,900
He was thinking sturdy. The Jackson
camp really wants who started it.

709
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,720
They do it brilliantly.
We other really did.

710
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:41,150
And they also do with that elliptical
kick, which are uh, that. Um,

711
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,600
what's it not elliptical care. What am
I working on? The word oblique kick.

712
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,840
That's a beautiful kick.
That's a beautiful kit because it's wheat

713
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,580
that fucking flying knees
down to my leftover there.

714
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,990
Whatever your name is. It's Brennan
shot. Oh, sorry. Brennan shop.

715
00:43:56,991 --> 00:44:00,890
You fought in UFC door does not look good
here. I get excited. My test, my test,

716
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,930
my test starts spiking.
Guys, when I watch fights.

717
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,190
What about when you hear engines?
They said no, no. It goes down.

718
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,080
If you let your testosterone to spike and
no disrespect, bring up vittores wife.

719
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,910
Good God. Yeah. God Mighty. They'll
Brazilians will, how to make a wall.

720
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,910
You're going to talk about my standup and
coming to my show? No, I dunno. I Dunno.

721
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,150
It's in Irvine.
June 8th ninth and 10th and good Jack,

722
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,740
you brought that up name Nate gave him
a finger like Yep, you got me there.

723
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,030
The one finger, not the bad
thing. Right. Got It. Oh,

724
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,910
nice. Couple of couple of front foot leg
kicks, guys cook. He said, no you didn't.

725
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,850
Oh Geez, Nate. The thing is where does,
where did these guys go after this?

726
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:44,220
You know what I'm saying?
Like the winner that heaven,

727
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,000
one fc to Ralph was there.

728
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,670
Vitro is going to show up when the party
Vito is going to dress like a soundbite

729
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,180
fighter with shoes on combat. Sambo.

730
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,640
I love it. They just went like,
let's take this but not this.

731
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,790
Let's take the shoes but not the
wrestling singlet. Let's go with it.

732
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,520
But not the pants. Okay. So

733
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,800
we'll go with head forgot.
Beat tours at Tristar.

734
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,500
No, for Rasa. Hobby for hostels.

735
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,760
That's racist for us. Her
Robbie. Oh damn is is damn good.

736
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:30,070
Brian Cowen. I'm sorry if I'm shooting
to the microphone. I got you. I got your,

737
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:32,590
your wine. They get your cheese. Got
here. We're going into their next,

738
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,320
she made it free to leave it. I'm already
going. No, no, no. You're, you're,

739
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:38,940
you're in California. You still in
California at Eddie. Philip, Philip.

740
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:43,890
Finish off California. Do. I Dunno. I'm
working on it, but uh, not for comedy.

741
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:46,900
Just for hanging out and went to
the Amalfi coast. Changed Year.

742
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,390
I had a great time. It felt
real good. What the fuck is
my copy to? Really, sorry.

743
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,500
Oh sorry.

744
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,380
There's something about the way people
live in other countries where they're

745
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:58,050
super relaxed and they re but
let me tell you something man.

746
00:45:58,051 --> 00:46:00,210
I had a really interesting
conversation with a cab driver.

747
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,050
Cab driver was driving us
around who takes cabs? I do.

748
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,090
We were in a place and they had a
cab and you know we've got a cap.

749
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,940
They have cabs there.

750
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,060
Oh word here around round tube.
One of the interesting thing the guy said,

751
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:19,980
he goes, ah, he goes, I want my children
to grow up in America. And I said, why?

752
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,640
And he goes, because he goes, man, he
goes, there's opportunity. He goes here,

753
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:26,760
there's not much you can do. He was
a smart dude and he was a cab driver.

754
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,300
And so we started having this like kind
of cool conversation cause he spoke,

755
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,020
I believe he spoke four languages. He
said maybe they're very smart business B.

756
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,360
This was in Amalfi coast. Where's
that? It's in Italy. It's a,

757
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,310
there's a place called
Ravello and rubella.

758
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,190
Rubella or Velo I think is rubella. But
anyway, it's beautiful. Gorgeous. I mean,

759
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:48,720
it's just pretty, the beaches
are nice. The oceans gorgeous.

760
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,720
And the people are just awesome people.

761
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:55,710
Just so nice and friendly and
interesting. But they, they,

762
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,860
they don't have a lot of opportunity
as far as like, um, careers.

763
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,050
More the simple life
according to this guy. I mean,

764
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,540
I mean if you live there and don't,
don't, yeah, according to this,

765
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,930
but the cab driver was very educated.
He was a smart fucking dude.

766
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,770
We got super lucky. We went there
and we went to Rome and, uh,

767
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,010
we went to Rome. We had
a really good, a guy

768
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,950
named Mark Court. Ladies and gentlemen
don't owe any fucking hand. Dude. He

769
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,670
looks great. He looks fucking great
to be, be this wine to earthy, bro.

770
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,980
A beautiful wine. It's super earthy.
He's that good. Do you? It's a lot

771
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,280
too earthy from alcohol.
Real number. Cut vetoed.

772
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,780
Just tagged him with a left upper cut.

773
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,870
Why don't shake his head
kick five feet tour cuts.

774
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,170
Oh, Shit. Uh, time up Nate Dogg.
Yes. No mate, Nate's coming back.

775
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:49,270
This is a fight guys. Holy Shit. What a
fight right hand by Nate dog won a fight.

776
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,380
Man. Is this an argument
for no testing? I yes it is.

777
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,300
Fuck yes it is and I'm
currently makes sense.

778
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,570
Neither of these guys are good testing in
there. I'm kidding. They're testing. I'm,

779
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,850
yeah, but, but still I,

780
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,780
I would like to see guys who need
a little help fight for longer.

781
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,060
It's called the master's division.

782
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,020
Nate Marquardt was one of the only guys
that's ever been pulled from the car.

783
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,610
Is that real? How dare you? That's
horrible. Dare you put that back up.

784
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,360
How dare you put that bag of sweet.
You look dog that.

785
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,660
That's a beautiful look. It's incredible.
I got to get on testosterone right now.

786
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,870
I think that's more than test. All right,
well I'm to do whatever he's doing.

787
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,350
It's post endocrin crash
two on the righthand side,

788
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:28,840
like a healthy looking dude
who's 40 years old. Right?

789
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,360
It can be pretty jammed and apparently
the birds compromise looks terrible then.

790
00:48:33,361 --> 00:48:36,160
Yeah. What's compromise? His
endocrine systems compromised.

791
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,520
But Nate is one of the only guys that
Sarah had been pulled off of a card

792
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,350
because he was on legal TRT and he shit
was so high. They was, hey, hey, hey.

793
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,850
No.

794
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Do supposed to be fighting Rick story
to keep him and beat him to buy tomatoes

795
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:55,780
defense. I know exact cost went down.
The doctor Nate didn't remember. Sure.

796
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:58,300
The shot's himself. The doctor didn't,
and he's like, no, you're fine.

797
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:02,440
And it was like, you sure? And he goes
yes. And gave him the shot. Yeah. Yeah.

798
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,890
He went to the doctor. Feel good. It's
looking good. It's looking good man.

799
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,580
He looks real good. She got here,
he had a red beard. Look at that.

800
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,160
It's switching up. Looking at us
in touch. Nate Dogg. Yeah, natives.

801
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:20,230
He switched it up good. And he's
also turning that left leg in. Good.

802
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,090
Like to get rid of the check.
That kick. He's sharp, man.

803
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:27,700
It's a better rest though. She'd
take two more take downs. Well,

804
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,560
he got that one in the first round.
I got stood up.

805
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:33,270
He might be a little bit
hesitant now. You might say, oh,

806
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,230
he's looking very good. We're
on the champ. Oh, look at
that cohort rule plan here.

807
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:43,780
Wow. Oh ha ha. What it means. Fuck.

808
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:47,050
It means balls. I mean, Dick Hands-up
Gracie used to always say that.

809
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:51,660
He'd always be like, boy,
Huh? It's like fuck. It's like
when you say fuck, you know,

810
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,640
you can say fuck or you can say shit.
It's the same thing.

811
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,450
Some of his bikes like [inaudible] boy do.

812
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:02,280
Do you remember when Nate Dogg Fuck
Woodley and strike force for the belt and

813
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,210
straight like Congress ministry that
Nate Marquardt that finish was one of the

814
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:10,870
finest. Oh, look at that big cut on
vitro. Oh, we won't. The head kick.

815
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:16,040
No body. Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate.

816
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,620
Nate is no dope.
Always swinging shit.

817
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:24,970
Do Nate looks fucking fantastic.
He does. Yeah, he does not.

818
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:26,290
Since the CB Dalloway fighters,

819
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,280
he looked as good and that
was a one punch knockout.

820
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,920
He knocked him the crazy. Yeah,
but that was way back in the dead.

821
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:36,520
Super old school. Five Dude, I'm
calling it. If you knocked out Victoria,

822
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,200
let's bring an Anderson spider it again
home. I on your back, you imagine?

823
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,670
Yeah. He's got as good
as it looks here, dude.

824
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:47,150
If he looks as good as you looked here, I
just, man, I might have to go with Nate,

825
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,810
right? Oh, oh. Oh. How
about, but listen, Vito,

826
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,350
Vito, our poles for
this. How about Horace?

827
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,390
Trying to have it.
How about that?

828
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,300
Vittores going to sail off to
rise and just go Bain on us.

829
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,260
He's got one more fight,

830
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,860
but he's got one more fight
in his country. Oh, Dang dumb.

831
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:13,610
They both think these guys are there.
A couple of Ding dings. Ooh. Hey Man.

832
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,230
[inaudible] bonds called it shit.

833
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I call this Dang [inaudible] heard his
voice mails to a side piece he called,

834
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:26,870
but it was a girl with Barry bonds. I know
what you need. You need some Dang Dang.

835
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,470
And it was just like, it didn't help them
at all. It was just like a horrible day.

836
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,480
Yeah, exactly. Me Too.

837
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,150
Don't fucking Barry Bonds for being great,

838
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,620
even though it took steroids and
likes girls hit me that night.

839
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,470
Fucking baseballs. I want
them on steroids. Exactly.

840
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,000
Whatever it is.
Nice.

841
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,230
Demised baseball.
No UPC kicks in baseball,

842
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,760
no feet towards, got a big cup.
A lot of scar tissue on that man.

843
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,480
I'm sure it's pretty easy to open them
up. Look at some highlights. Boom.

844
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,560
Clipped him with a right hook.

845
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,770
Nate with the high kick to,

846
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,100
do you remember the story of veto a
sister dying man when they took her for

847
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:10,920
ransom, but there's that upper cut.
Yeah, it was horrible. Horrible man.

848
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:13,600
Took it for ransom and they
killed her and do the right buyer.

849
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,970
Brazil don't put ground. No. That's
the worst thing I can imagine.

850
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,110
One of the guys working for the UFC. It
got held at gunpoint this weekend. Really?

851
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,950
Yeah. What happened? Nothing to give them
their money was just a production guy.

852
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:27,060
Well God damn,

853
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,540
here we go.

854
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,730
Brazil is beautiful. It's dangerous as
shit. Well, you know Chicago's dangerous.

855
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:36,470
Two men go to the wrong place in the
afternoon on the south side. Yeah,

856
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:40,630
just as dangerous and a lot
of places it's just, you know,

857
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,820
you can have crime everywhere. You know
where it's not dangerous. Australia,

858
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,480
Australia is beautiful. I'm headed there
tomorrow. I love it. I love Australia.

859
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:51,800
Nervous as shit about it.
Why are you nervous, Sydney?

860
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,230
I don't know why you let us necessarily
traveling, man. I don't travel.

861
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,750
Might as well be Americans. They'd be
like, they're like, you know what I say?

862
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:03,230
Canadians are 20% less douche bags
then a American the way nicer.

863
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,000
Same thing with Australia. They're like
Canadians with a cooler accent. Wow.

864
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:10,840
I'm sold. Did the shit. I lived
there. I could live there.
It's not even in America.

865
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,150
They drive on the left side of the
road. Never been there. I'd live there.

866
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:16,900
How dare you not go there? I know what
he's been offered. Your 50 go there.

867
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,410
I've been offered. I just haven't
gone. I love it too busy training.

868
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,340
I went to melt. Wow. Okay. I
went to Melbourne last year,
maybe year and a half ago.

869
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,350
She do shows out there. Joe Now. Fucking
loved it. Yeah. You do chose. Yeah.

870
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,380
Did a couple shows out there
that love you, Brendan.

871
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,740
Brendan's going to be there and he's
sold out a bunch of theaters. Yeah,

872
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,100
they'll love you for sure.
They're great people and by the way,

873
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,860
big as United States.
Same amount of people as la.

874
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,680
We're going to dig that entire kind of
chose as big as the United States. Yup.

875
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,870
Cause he can take you a start with Alaska.

876
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,440
I did nothing in the middle.
Right. It's like on the skirt.

877
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,170
The middle kills you.
Everything in the Middle East.

878
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,670
Your ass eat your ass and then in
the ocean and shark city. Yeah,

879
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:54,840
the ocean sharks city.

880
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:58,890
The water around the ocean is
crocodile city and you get deep inside.

881
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:02,130
You got snake city and spider city.
They have brown snakes.

882
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:03,960
They kill you instantly.
Tiger snakes,

883
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,350
a bunch of spiders to kill you
instantly enjoying the water to cool off

884
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:11,230
crocodiles boxes, box,
jellyfish box jumps.

885
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:12,743
They fucked.

886
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,260
Some guy sent me a picture of a
saltwater croc passing a great white.

887
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,440
Oh Jesus Christ. I think it was
photoshopped. It might not be.

888
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:23,940
Let's say it helped you live
in the Australian doctor
sent me that. Sorry guys.

889
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,430
Doctors sometimes are not
savvy with the Internet.

890
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,680
They have student loans to think
about it and they doctor photographs.

891
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,230
He's not a professional.

892
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,140
Made my mark car with a fucking dude
inside kick these, these. This is red.

893
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,280
How do you call this fight?
Right? He needs to finish him.

894
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,600
These guys are bruised up
because Gilbert fuck around.

895
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,990
Sel Brasil is looking great.

896
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,800
We'll vittores a legend so he's already
up to rounds. You know what men?

897
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,570
Nate looks super strong in this fight.
It does.

898
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:57,830
It's back is looking swollen like
by super strong technique again.

899
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,030
That's got to his defense looking
good too. Well, he looks like health.

900
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,000
Not Tired at all. Yeah,
he looks healthy. Right?

901
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:10,260
I think also a big thing for Nate was
going up to one 85 improved this CIM.

902
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,300
It improved his, his vitality. Yeah.

903
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:18,090
I just think being at one 70 he was
so depleted. Who's a big s seven oh,

904
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:21,790
he's huge. He's so big. Walk around
at 12 feet is so strong, man.

905
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:26,910
Oh Man. He just clipped detour. Did
he catch him with that left hook?

906
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:28,890
Did it graze them grace
because he grades them.

907
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,950
This is an interesting fight,
man,

908
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:39,290
because I think both of these guys
kind of at the end of their UFC rope,

909
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:44,180
right? Arguably. Oh, tagged them.
Boom Pole on the back. Nine.

910
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,200
You both look right, but
they're both, they're both like,

911
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:53,000
if you didn't know that and you saw this
well veto, you tell kind of by his body,

912
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,130
you'd be like, something's
going on. He's a legend though.

913
00:55:55,131 --> 00:55:58,250
So he put up with the body fat. Yeah.
Well it's not just the body fat.

914
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:01,640
It's like there's a looseness to him
all. We, I kicked him with the left.

915
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:06,890
He a bunch of muscle down there to so
much more meat. It's all gone. So meeting,

916
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,030
but it's technique is still really good.
Have such a freak.

917
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,540
Oh Jesus Christ caught that on
the, on the elbow. People Forget.

918
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:17,510
Vitro is one of the best athletes
that ever coming the octagon.

919
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,900
Come on on the steroid.
Shit out. Guidance Stroll.

920
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,400
We'll kick at all until he fights. Luke
Rockhold throws one in missing sometimes.

921
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,710
Another one at Kaos him. Oh boy. Nate
got hurt there. You got tagged. Well,

922
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:33,690
he went looking for that takedown. Looking
at what I call an educated jab guys.

923
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,990
Oh, but that left high kick is strong
and they keeps moving to is right. Yeah.

924
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:40,540
You could block that all day, dude.
This shit is going to fuck your arms.

925
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:45,190
I'll tell you what's weird is, was
Tristar with GSP for ab. Oh Shit.

926
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,300
Dang done with that head kick.

927
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,840
So I'm wondering for us really helped
Vittori with his game plan for sure.

928
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,760
You know,
some fucking trailer or something about,

929
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,030
I can't believe what you're saying.
I'm just kidding. I'll let you for us,

930
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,780
look at that right writer when
they show Nate's right side, like,

931
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:02,110
look how red his fucking arm is.
He's also Pale as fuck. I know,

932
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:05,080
but that's why you can see the impact.
Like when you have a super white boy,

933
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,130
you get to see like where
he's been getting scratched
up in the white boy. Yeah.

934
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,660
How long was the veto with for, for
us just this case. Just what does it,

935
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:16,900
all the redness all over Nate's arm
has been known to jump around campus.

936
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:21,430
That's kind of his thing. Hmm. Well
sort of, but I mean not that much.

937
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:24,610
I mean a lot of guys have jumped around
more than him slapping me from named

938
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:25,480
Mark White Ladies and gentlemen.

939
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,550
Okay.

940
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:31,370
Oh Damn. That's tough in Brasil. They're
probably going to be a great fight.

941
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,660
Great fight. One round one
and two. That's great. Fine.

942
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,610
Not balls deep and cheese and half a
glass of wine, but from my perspective,

943
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:42,880
one and two, as long as more cheese,
I'm time traveling from that weed.

944
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,990
Goddamn la speed.
We'd would the,

945
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,460
what is I say it was bamboo
leaves or something like that.

946
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:55,750
They wrap these blunts with, with
bamboo now Sam's panda style. Yeah,

947
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,230
some quality bear style.
That's a beautiful installers.
Don't fuck with bamboo.

948
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:01,780
Oh man, they didn't have that wrap. That's
all right. Come on. You guys stopped,

949
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:05,800
was it? No, no, not at all. The other day.
No, I don't got shit on it. Yeah. Yeah.

950
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,590
I know what you're talking about on
second angel dust or something real.

951
00:58:08,591 --> 00:58:10,900
The real interesting thing,
if you're going to go blunt,

952
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,790
you really should go Charlie Murphy style,

953
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:17,260
which is where you take a Swisher sweets,
classic the weed and you put it inside,

954
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:21,640
take the tobacco out and so then you're
getting the harshness of the tobacco and

955
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:24,760
you get that weird tobacco
buzz from the outside.

956
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,960
They had that weird nicotine buzz. I like
it. Nicotine buzz every now and then,

957
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:33,190
man. I've smoked cigarettes before.
I've done, yeah, what a great times,

958
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:35,600
but I've smoked a couple of cigarettes
before going on stage before. I like,

959
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,470
this was a great fight, man. What's up
Donald Serone. Oh yeah, I ate some dip.

960
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,720
Oh fuck that. I swallowed some Dick.
He took cigarettes. Every now and then.

961
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,830
I say Nate's got it. But you should
win two to one. It's personal,

962
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,010
but do they have the same split decisions?
Let's see what we got here

963
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,880
for this contest.

964
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,210
Oh, all three feet tall.
Piece of shit. Brazil.

965
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:07,370
I'll fuck you. Oh, come
on. Put his hands on this.

966
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,870
Damn. It's Brazil. That's
you got to figure you up.

967
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,850
You're just like Glen Brazilian
lose around I guess. I Dunno.

968
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,020
Good fight though. Those are terrible
jersey. I say the feet, right? Definitely.

969
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,270
That last round to one. So you
thought vitro one, two? No, no,

970
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:31,040
no, no. Hell No. Nate one, one and two,
and then he, then Vito in the third round.

971
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,220
Veto anything again.
I paid a shitload of provolone.

972
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:37,900
I've had some wine and a lot to watch
some good moments of the fight by

973
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,750
[inaudible] and I thought I saw
a few more good moments by Nate,

974
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,410
but I was in no means judging
the fight by no means profit.

975
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:51,200
Brian Stan with a pink tie. Confident
gentlemen. It's not a big deal. You know,

976
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:52,610
even a fee.
Those first two,

977
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:56,360
he did lose the first round kind of
big right cause he got taken down.

978
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:00,170
I'm struck,
it was all about Brazil.

979
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:04,220
Is Brazil going with the new rules? They
do it the fuck didn't want, but did they,

980
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,400
did they have the new rules? Like as
far as judging and everything like that?

981
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:11,390
I don't think so.
Texted classy man.

982
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,900
The Texas doesn't, uh,
doesn't accept those rules.

983
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,660
Brazil is the wild west and New York.
That's it. Everyone else you're,

984
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:22,190
they're false shoot with,
well New York has just juvenile New York.

985
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,390
They're just morons.

986
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,500
What it is is they just don't
have a lot of experience.

987
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,710
New York state is only
had MMA for a year or so,

988
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,570
so they're just going
through growing pains.

989
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,750
I feel like that's what's going on with
New York. It's just, when I say juvenile,

990
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:38,750
I mean like they're childish.
They just start having a had a while,

991
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:42,350
but the mistakes they're making, I mean
you're talking to in extreme mistakes,

992
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,210
but who made that mistake was Dan Merkel,

993
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:47,130
Yada Dan Margiela Yada is a
super experienced referee.

994
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:51,420
The guy who made the
mistake in the Mercury Yada,

995
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:54,440
it was a merger led to her. I thought it
was herb dean. Which one was Mark Liata?

996
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,740
There's what? Which one was
the Musashi fight? Was that
herb? Dino. Herb Dean. Okay.

997
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:03,110
Then the mercury out of fight was,
there was another woman was in New York.

998
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:07,250
Was it Weidman? Weidman watch one
was Weidman was saucy. I thought.

999
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,720
I thought it was her. Her Dean
was born. That was that one,

1000
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:16,280
but there was one with a, there was one
with American Liana recently. Either way,

1001
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:21,170
the point being both Margiela Yada and
herb dean are excellent refs and no shit

1002
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:24,410
goes wrong. Man. Her been
fucking up lately though.
He's my favorite fucking up.

1003
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,570
A lot of people have been saying that.
I'm not going with that. Well I'm,

1004
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,660
it's just, I mean you're going
to fuck up every now and then.

1005
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,930
You're going to fuck
you really can't breath.

1006
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,840
I fuck up and submission only
and I fuck up every now and then.

1007
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:40,970
I've done maybe two or three big fuckers.

1008
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,020
Fucking done 1,000,005.
You're alive man.

1009
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:47,330
How can you not fuck
up that kind of speed?

1010
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:51,380
And sometimes I think I'm saying like
[inaudible] but I'm really saying Nate

1011
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,140
like I'll fuck it.
I'll have it in my head.

1012
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,660
Cause crossed because
what I'm trying to just,

1013
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,690
I'm trying to pay attention and I'm
all trying to talk at the same. No,

1014
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:03,230
it's not the weed. No, because
I'm doing, here's his back.

1015
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:08,300
I don't do the UFC high ever.
Ever. I did like two high ever.

1016
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:11,330
I didn't like it like when they
back in the day, back in the day,

1017
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:14,120
like 2002 or something like that. But, um,

1018
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,290
I don't do them high cause I don't wanna
I don't want to ever have the urge to

1019
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,190
talk about some shit fight related

1020
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,270
because that's what this is. Like,
this is the whole, this fight,

1021
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,930
this fight companion podcast shows the
whole reason why I should never do.

1022
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:31,370
We'd what does that, when you
watch it, that's more Gelada there.

1023
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,870
That's the Weidman was saucy
fine. Okay. So I was right.

1024
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,240
So Weidman versus Musashi
was Dan burglary, Yada. Um,

1025
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,750
the other one that was similar,
there was another one that was similar.

1026
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,130
That was herb dean.

1027
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:48,560
That was a recent funding fowl as well.
Who,

1028
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:51,290
what was the fight people on line
right now? Oh no, it's dirty.

1029
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,310
Alvarez and pouring.
Yes. Thank you very much.

1030
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:57,510
My fucking beautiful,
beautiful,

1031
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,560
beautiful [inaudible] top on that.
So that's, that's a perfect example.

1032
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,450
I respect super.

1033
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,740
You got to give me a list of top five
best referees on the planet Earth,

1034
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,240
Dan Merkel, Yada and herb dean or bolt
on that list. And they both made errors,

1035
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,470
although he's number one, he's the
gold standards. And by the way,

1036
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:23,250
not like this. Oh sure he did. But
Marillo Bustamante versus um, oh,

1037
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:26,490
in 19 [inaudible] fucked up.
He tapped him.

1038
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,630
Marillo tapped him and then they restarted
the fight and did it again. Look,

1039
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,540
he's the gold standard because of his
experience. And that was a mistake.

1040
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:36,180
It was just experienced and it was
a loss though. Currently though,

1041
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:39,360
he hasn't fucked up like he's the best.
I feel like big John's the best,

1042
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,590
but I'm feeling by far,
you know,

1043
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:43,050
here's another one that doesn't get enough
credit because he went to the pokey,

1044
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:47,550
Josh Rosenthal,
he's Josh Joshua sand outstanding.

1045
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,630
He's out. He's out. He's out.
He's out. But he never got yes,

1046
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,000
snitched on him.

1047
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,880
He, I'm a brown belt in Jujitsu. I
think it might be black by now, but uh,

1048
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,810
what's he doing now?
He's refereeing and getting,

1049
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,320
did some keying in the cages and shit.
But here's what the referee X. Excellent,

1050
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,990
excellent, excellent,
excellent. [inaudible] he's
one of my favorites. Yeah.

1051
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:17,460
And also like super like
out of the picture, like you
don't even know he's there.

1052
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,630
So his homeboy with the, the
Yosemite Sam Mustache, Mike Tran,

1053
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,910
Swan Beltran Bell trends in my top
10 in the world to stop three from,

1054
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:28,650
he's one of the smartest.

1055
01:04:28,651 --> 01:04:31,740
I've deal with a lot of people
in the industry over the years.

1056
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:36,150
He's one of the smartest dudes I've
ever met and Mike is fucking great human

1057
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:39,270
being held. Is he so nice? I'll try him.

1058
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,700
Nicest guy that got to be nice about
tomato mustache like that. By the way,

1059
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,660
you knew he was a cop and you're
a Mongol. He was like, Huh?

1060
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,140
He was like an undercover,
uh, I think an undercover,

1061
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:52,130
like special detective thing that might
wanna look at your phone off. Yeah.

1062
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:56,220
I don't know. Mike Beltrani was, hey,

1063
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:00,210
was an undercover like, oh, I
shouldn't say that. If he's not sure,

1064
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:01,890
he will double down. I, no, no, actually,

1065
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:06,690
maybe I shouldn't be talking about it
and it's too late. You Fuck, sorry.

1066
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,140
Just ratted him out. Now you're
going to die by talking about it.

1067
01:05:10,141 --> 01:05:13,230
What you should do is not, I didn't
know that, but I'm just going to look.

1068
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,240
I got to look at, you
know, he's writing a book.

1069
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:18,520
I think that didn't give
me super skeptical Hipaa
wise because he's writing a

1070
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:20,180
book. I think he's going
to write a book about his,

1071
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:21,700
is someone going to true hall of fame?

1072
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:26,950
He's writing a book that he was not
just in the UFC hall of fame. He,

1073
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:29,690
this is soccer. Rob would go into
the hall of fame, commentate on,

1074
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,600
I come in straight from yoga to do these
fucking UFC and it looks so fucked up.

1075
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,470
I look greasy. I have red marks
on your face and head, hot yoga.

1076
01:05:38,471 --> 01:05:42,040
I slept for the next two days, but
I just looked at myself, I'm like,

1077
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,960
they can only usually a couple seconds
of video of me. I looked at her lineup,

1078
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:49,960
we get done for, I love Sakuraba. Oh Man.
Soccer. I grew up in the UFC hall of fame.

1079
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:52,270
The greatest. That's what they're
doing. I think that's what this is.

1080
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,480
And then they health,
he'd wear shirts that said water on him.

1081
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,890
He fought in the UFC and also
because the UFC owns pride,

1082
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:02,170
it's a legit um,
oh.

1083
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:06,940
So we learned pride guys in 100% they
should obey Dorin fade or wanting to lay

1084
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:11,560
cro cop bar.
But [inaudible] has got that issue.

1085
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:15,850
He landed a turning sidekick on Vito
or they put them down on the ground,

1086
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,130
Euler, Euler didn't tap and
then they stopped the fight
anyway and he's like, no,

1087
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:25,080
no, no, no. I didn't tap.
What's so cool about broken?

1088
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:28,660
So Gracie's arm Anton has a
picture of that cancels on,

1089
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:31,690
but with a boiler boiler it just
didn't tap and the boiler was like,

1090
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:35,620
I'm fine man. Like yeah, I'm
getting my arm chewed up.

1091
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:40,890
But like for a boiler that proved
to be the case in your fight Eddie,

1092
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,470
because when you're that grappling
matches that you fucked his leg up.

1093
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,780
I remember watching that
from the sidelines and I was
like, this shit is so over.

1094
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,500
The last guy he just took it.

1095
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,430
He just let his knee get mangled
or is he that flexible dude,

1096
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:57,340
there's no way he can be that flexible.
He's just tough as shit.

1097
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:00,250
He's just tough as shit.
He dealt with it.

1098
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,420
He dealt with getting his knee torn apart.
Hence a wash on the paper.

1099
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,830
Hence roof. Curious to tap.
Yeah, they want some swatches.

1100
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:14,770
He just walked as his own fucking
arm break. He will not tap.

1101
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:19,750
I'm eating this cheese like a Monday.
Can Jake at afraid? Isn't that crazy?

1102
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:24,320
Yeah. Shot. Trey wants me to
do a tone in did a supermatch.

1103
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:31,160
Shachi wants me to have one that can
Sakharova. Did you see, did you do it?

1104
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,880
Are you going to do it? But how's
your back dude? I don't know man.

1105
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:38,620
My back is not 100% yet. How's
your back for a hundred thou? What?

1106
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,500
They offered you like serious cheese.
We haven't even.

1107
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,680
How's your back for hunkered
down on a wheel of challenge?

1108
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,610
I want you to shut the fuck up.

1109
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:48,390
I'm negotiating for them and we're
not starting at a hundred. No.

1110
01:07:48,391 --> 01:07:52,740
You at least the hunting.
Some cheese bro and all this cheap.

1111
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:56,080
We're talking about check or is it
coming up and talking about dollars?

1112
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,490
A couple of things.

1113
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:01,990
Shackles still haven't recovered
from my back surgery one too.

1114
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,160
I'm trying to find out if I'm, I need,
I might need surgery on my shoulder.

1115
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:09,370
I'm not sure I've been doing that.
Hang in therapy. I don't know man.

1116
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,470
Hang right now.
Not yet.

1117
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,950
But based on those videos
that I'm watching about the
hanging that uh, you know,

1118
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:19,490
if you have any kind of tears, if
you hang, eventually it'll fix it up.

1119
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,830
That's what I'm hearing is that wrong?
Hinged mints.

1120
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,070
What it is is one of the things that
happens with people with shoulder injuries

1121
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:29,270
is you get a lot of pain from impingements
means your mobility is impaired

1122
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:34,420
because he get tears and damage and then
your shoulder sort of like gets scar

1123
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:38,690
tissue to never, it never increases its
mobility or never regained his mobility.

1124
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,880
And one of the best ways
to regain your mobility,

1125
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,900
get on a chin up bar and fucking hang.
Just hang.

1126
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:48,470
And I hang every day, every day.
It's one of the main things I do.

1127
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:51,350
There's two main things. How long
do you do it for? Two minutes.

1128
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:54,050
But I'll just start out with 30 seconds.
Just loosen up,

1129
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:55,940
get my hands loose now
and then I'll let it go.

1130
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,240
And then sometimes I'll go into a minute
and a half and sometimes they going to

1131
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:01,400
two minutes. But I take
my iPhone, I put it on,

1132
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,950
I hit the stopwatch and then I hang.

1133
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,040
And you're one of the reasons why I
did it because when we, first of all,

1134
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:08,330
because it's really good
for your shoulders, but two,

1135
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:13,331
because we did fear factor and we had
men and women hanging and the women,

1136
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,510
all one the men couldn't
hang glider cause him. Yes,

1137
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:20,810
because the men are too heavy and they
couldn't hold their weight up because if

1138
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:23,750
you're a man, even if you have
stronger hands, is stronger muscles,

1139
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:28,910
the amount more that you weigh like
against 130 pound woman, you, you know,

1140
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:32,060
most guys are weak in that regard.
And most primates,

1141
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,860
that's one of the things
about the shoulder,

1142
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:35,750
like our shoulders came from primates.

1143
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:39,330
So the premise behind this
hanging is that some of the,

1144
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:43,760
the lack of mobility and impingements
and problems that we have at our shoulder

1145
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:47,600
joint is simply from a lack of your
shoulder articulating correctly and

1146
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,290
stretching out like and,

1147
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,270
and doing sozo doing range of
motion things like I do a lot of um,

1148
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:58,100
Kettlebell a shield casts with,
I'm not a Kettlebell, but a club.

1149
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,670
I do these shield casts, which are
really big. So these big movements,

1150
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:05,550
you got to wield the sword. And another
thing I saw, wonder woman bro Strong. Yes.

1151
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:09,020
I think I do that I really recommend
is bottoms up kettle bells.

1152
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:13,120
Will you put the kettle
bell upside down and you're,

1153
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:17,520
you're working on some serious stability.
This is only 40 pounds, but not man.

1154
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:21,020
Very difficult to do like that. I
don't know. That's pretty impressive.

1155
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,660
Let me see Brian try that. Well, I
could do it now. It's 70. I want to,

1156
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,690
I started out,
okay,

1157
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,940
can I bring you to Italy for a
second and pull your little wine?

1158
01:10:28,941 --> 01:10:33,450
Then I'll then I'll show you how that
shoulder was fucking, it was that,

1159
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:36,590
that shoulder. I had to have
a, I had a stem cell shots.

1160
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:41,420
Shots already sold as Jackson.
The show that I'm pulling back,

1161
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:46,421
I shot maybe 80 arrows today
with the 86 can we put this up?

1162
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:48,950
He was smoking my before. Well, no,

1163
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:54,860
he did it ladies and gentlemen. It's
hard to balance. Well that's really good.

1164
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:57,710
It's really good for stroke,
shoulder stability. They will,

1165
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,630
let's just start off light.

1166
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:02,930
If anybody's doing it and I recommend
no more than five repetitions,

1167
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,510
I believe in that for weightlifting.
I believe in no,

1168
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,410
no more than five repetitions and
I think you're really cardio. Yeah.

1169
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:11,930
Your cardio and your endurance
should be done doing other things.

1170
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:14,160
Either skill work like martial arts,

1171
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,090
whether it's Jujitsu or
kickboxing or strength and
conditioning work like running

1172
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,610
and shit like that.
Fucking 12 reps send them an email.

1173
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:27,040
I don't think so.
Sun lift off

1174
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,820
your 250 pounds. No, no. Pretty
Shock. Reminds House, you look gross

1175
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:40,310
sir. Shop reps with 600 pound
revenue. Not done. Not done.

1176
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,370
He reps with 600 pounds.
That impresses me.

1177
01:11:45,371 --> 01:11:50,130
Those fuck movements. Oh God,
yes. That's the best for him.

1178
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:56,590
She kept 600 pound barbell. That's
right. Sitting there doing this shit.

1179
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,760
So even big goes like this motherfucker
will let me have a ahead of time now

1180
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,170
he's, he's, they're strong
than the shops. Strong.

1181
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,740
You've been lifting since you were
at, but fourth grade, fifth grade.

1182
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,910
It's got some 10 Sam, I had a shoulder
question. Oh, what was it? Sorry.

1183
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,030
Just take that goddamn
fight. Okay. I like this.

1184
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:18,560
Yeah.

1185
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,240
Well the thing about the bottoms up kettle
bells is they say you should be able

1186
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:26,990
to do 90% of what you can do.
Normally.

1187
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:29,990
Most people can't like 99% can't,

1188
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:34,070
but they say if you have a real stable
joint, what's going to hold you back?

1189
01:12:34,071 --> 01:12:38,750
It's not strength. It's a
stabilizing muscles, the
stabilizer stabilizing muscles,

1190
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:43,220
the ones that oftentimes cause
issues with your range of motion.

1191
01:12:43,221 --> 01:12:46,160
And with using it in terms
of functional strength,

1192
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:49,310
like I'm using it for martial
arts are fusing it for, you know,

1193
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:53,360
anything where you would be using like
I guess what I would even think sports,

1194
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:56,590
like throwing things. I mean I would
think that shoulders to abilities,

1195
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,850
like super important.
I remember when I was going to ask you,

1196
01:12:58,851 --> 01:13:02,720
when you say no more than five
reps, do you mean uh, use the, uh,

1197
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,980
the amount of weight where you fail
five rounds? No, no, no, just regular.

1198
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:12,550
I've been following this Pavel
Satsu Lien regimen and he created,

1199
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:16,070
he's like the godfather of kettle
bells in the United States.

1200
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:18,120
He's the guy that came over from Russia.
He's,

1201
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,920
he's got a ton of books
out and videos and,

1202
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:26,060
and his belief is that strength is a
skill and that you should never do a skill

1203
01:13:26,061 --> 01:13:28,520
when you're tired. And so
the idea, and I'm, I'm,

1204
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,670
if I'm paraphrasing and fucking
this up please, I apologize.

1205
01:13:31,671 --> 01:13:35,210
But the principle behind it I know of
and the principle is that like say if you

1206
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:37,730
can lift something and
you get to like seven,

1207
01:13:37,731 --> 01:13:39,460
eight reps and you get to the age rep,

1208
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:41,620
keep

1209
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:42,281
going,
keep going.

1210
01:13:42,281 --> 01:13:47,230
It's like she'd never do that because you
get the strength from doing the amount

1211
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:51,430
of repetitions. Like say if you
do five reps, you can get to,

1212
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:54,760
if you could do 10 to five
but then wait a long time,

1213
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:58,240
wait like 10 minutes and then
comes took five, wait another,

1214
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:01,840
wait another 10 minutes, then do another
follow. People would beg to differ. Right?

1215
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:05,410
You're right, you're right. A lot
of people, a lot of people would,

1216
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,630
but I guarantee you if
you had a cobble on,

1217
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:11,410
you should listen to Pavle
on Tim Ferriss's podcast.
Do a little bit every day.

1218
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:15,040
It's kind, Kinda like you do
a yes, exactly. You should
make sure that you can,

1219
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:17,110
you can do that too.
But I'm telling you,

1220
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,140
one of the good things about this is
you have people that get injured less

1221
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,560
because your, your muscles are
never working like full fatigued.

1222
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,390
They're never working
to the point of failure,

1223
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:28,330
but you're still lifting heavy weight,
but you're lifting.

1224
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:32,350
Say if you could lift something and you
could do 10 repetitions, don't do 10,

1225
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:36,040
do five, do five, put it down
and take a big long break.

1226
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,920
But it's not endurance.
It's like you do a scene.

1227
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:44,470
I'll be doing the same number of reps.
The problem is it takes longer.

1228
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:47,530
Like you would need to be at the gym
for an hour and a half versus 40 minutes

1229
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:49,760
and it doesn't burn to death.
I had a guy who

1230
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,190
there's some benefits to it.
I think that as best as to,

1231
01:14:54,191 --> 01:14:56,230
I don't think just doing
that all the time. Those,

1232
01:14:56,231 --> 01:15:00,460
the answer maybe I would love to
talk to have you sit down with,

1233
01:15:00,461 --> 01:15:03,040
you should have him on your show,
man. The guys in California, poppy,

1234
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:07,620
he's a wizard and he speaks
perfect English wiz or did
they change your sheets?

1235
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,540
Three of us should do it because you're
a fan. He's a fest. We should do it.

1236
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:12,520
I'll do it. I'll do what you
guys do it. I want to list,

1237
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:17,050
could even have them in here. Um, one of
the things that he, that guy brought to,

1238
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:20,680
um, to the United States is
not just the kettle bell,

1239
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:24,550
but also like some serious
fucking bodyweight exercises.

1240
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:27,670
And then like some movements
that now have become,

1241
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,200
have become like really standard.

1242
01:15:29,201 --> 01:15:33,130
Like I'm Brian counts pour me from
and where are you going to Italy?

1243
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,240
We need to learn now. Now we're in, in
late 2008. I want you to take your time.

1244
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:41,500
Like I need a food food.
He's going to like my Italy hit.

1245
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:44,770
This is via Ben until while I do, but
what I was going to say is that, um, uh,

1246
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,690
Turkish getup, which is a big one of
this, it's huge. Turkish get up is so big.

1247
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:52,870
There's Pavel, the dude's a stud, by
the way. I always wear sweat pants. Hey,

1248
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:56,260
bring shab up doing a Turkish get
up with one 45 please bring him up.

1249
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,850
Isn't that ridiculous? It was with a bar,
which is even more than that. 200 pounds.

1250
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,110
Then you do two 25,
225 pound Turkey,

1251
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:08,980
one arm techniques. Awful.
Yes. The technique is off.

1252
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:13,020
It's not that awful begging for a blown
disk, but that's still super impressed.

1253
01:16:13,021 --> 01:16:17,320
Who? 25 225 they're strong
in the shop. I told you,

1254
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,380
hold on, I'm going to get you.
I'm going to fruit you up.

1255
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:24,730
You want to go California, you want
to stay in California? Look at this.

1256
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,451
How much weight is,

1257
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:30,451
is that that right there is one 45
that's one 55 one 55 look at him.

1258
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,640
He's a fucking beast.
And he did it with two 25 is ridiculous.

1259
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,550
That is ridiculous. The technique shit
though. You bet it doesn't matter man.

1260
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:43,150
But the point is that you have that kind
of core power that you can get up from

1261
01:16:43,151 --> 01:16:46,090
your feet.
And how applicable is that to grappling?

1262
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:50,440
So one of the most applicable, like
when terms of like functional strength,

1263
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,340
Turkish get up is one of
these most applicable because
if you could fucking lie

1264
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:58,990
on your back and press something and
then sit up with that fucker overhead.

1265
01:16:58,991 --> 01:16:59,681
That was my move.

1266
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,500
If you remember like with ruling
as soon as the arm would pass them.

1267
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:07,240
So I can try to just,
oh so strong if you or to Turkish get up.

1268
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:11,960
Yeah. Strong Turkish get man is
like one of the most for Jujitsu,

1269
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,960
especially one of the
most applicable movements.

1270
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,630
Kaja Dahlia Versus Carolina Kayvon cause
she said Jackson, good fucking fights.

1271
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,900
Got Somebody to change camps.

1272
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:24,680
The Jack set some traps on her and
she's got that dude, not Greg Jackson,

1273
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:29,600
who's the old guy. That's her
main coach. Oh fuck. Oh my God.

1274
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:33,920
The forgotten man in New Mexico.
Oh my God.

1275
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:38,870
I can't remember. Cologic Adelia he was
part of the [inaudible] winkies lack.

1276
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:43,100
Yes. He's really close with Keith
Carradine and Rashad. Oh my God.

1277
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:47,900
Anytime the wall and he's
like a New Mexico [inaudible]
a legend. He's a cop. No,

1278
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:51,230
not Steven Seagal. You
son of a bitch. A cop.

1279
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,990
Latrelle nope. Latrelle yeah, but
not something like this that Steve,

1280
01:17:56,991 --> 01:18:00,830
it's something Latrelle Tim. No,
no, thank God. I remembered that.

1281
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:04,020
The trail something Lou trail,
right?

1282
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,350
She's just a door guy.
Liens on the case you want say Calphalon.

1283
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,840
You want to go ahead and live with me?
She is

1284
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:19,050
very strong. Brennan Shot, proven
CTE. Can Be overcome. Thanks.

1285
01:18:19,051 --> 01:18:23,130
The output from the Alpha
brain and some copy gas,

1286
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,770
10% off cheese. That article shop about
that drew Michael Finley had about CCT.

1287
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,240
No, it's really good. He wrote on
the player's Tribune. Oh really?

1288
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:33,510
He did a bunch of like Ben's. We'll work
with it. It's I'll, I'll link it on here.

1289
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,740
Please do. Jamie. Jamie,
we want it. You want it?

1290
01:18:35,741 --> 01:18:38,720
You want to come to Italy if you have
Anatole with me or do you want to let me

1291
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:40,850
finish this California.
Oh Shit. California.

1292
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,830
Claudia is by far the best 150 pound
girl in the world. Nut named Yolanda.

1293
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,730
She's so fucking good. She's
pretty Badass. She's very,

1294
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,980
she's trapped and she looks like a little
Brazilian pimpled and they're like,

1295
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:55,830
well, this cute one that's
six PAC sun. She's gangster.

1296
01:18:55,831 --> 01:19:00,070
She wants to do Ebi too, depending on how
this fight ends. Like if she comes out.

1297
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:05,420
Yeah, she's, she's an athlete.
She's gangster. Oh, Mario.

1298
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:09,680
The hearts as you do that hard thing
because he really loves emojis,

1299
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:14,540
but he can't bring one into the octagon
with him. We did quality a good daily.

1300
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,960
I relaxed his fuck. That's Carolina
[inaudible]. Whatever her name is.

1301
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:22,400
I meant that's what I meant. Claude
Jack Kadeja. I know. Now I know that.

1302
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:26,280
I just love, I love Polen. I love
her. I think she's gorgeous. She's,

1303
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:31,170
let's see if she gets the rub right.
She went five hard rounds,

1304
01:19:31,171 --> 01:19:35,340
but Yolana let's see. What's a passion
comes back. Oh, clean, right hand.

1305
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,480
The polls have been through the worst.
They're history. They're like, fuck up.

1306
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,040
I octagon. I went to World War
One and two mother fuckers.

1307
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,850
They don't fuck around eating munitions
with your breakfast. They suck.

1308
01:19:46,851 --> 01:19:51,490
Holds there a plan in both wars. I saw one
vitamins. Nothing you saw wonder woman.

1309
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,680
I grew up Patty Jenkins by the way.
Number one.

1310
01:19:54,681 --> 01:19:57,400
I think it's going to be the
biggest growth. Any Romans,

1311
01:19:57,530 --> 01:20:01,730
I'm proud of her good fucking movie.
I heard it's really good. It's good.

1312
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,540
We like superhero movies
and I love superhero movies.

1313
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,870
It's a good fucking look.
When you make a superhero movie,

1314
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:14,580
you're confined to make a movie about a
superhero and the good guys to win and

1315
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:17,820
you know that going in.
She dealt with all that and she did it.

1316
01:20:17,821 --> 01:20:22,530
She did it on her own terms and it's
about us. It's about Patty Jenkins,

1317
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:26,910
the dude I don't want to spoil or
almost spoiled toilet wonder woman,

1318
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:30,750
wonder woman, Patty Jenkins. I
enjoyed the fuck's that radar.

1319
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:31,740
You don't want to hear as good.

1320
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:35,250
It's on iTunes now is that mutual life
that Ryan Reynolds movie people keep

1321
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,770
telling me that will see that movie dope.

1322
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,800
Chris Pine is hilarious and wonder
woman though, right? I love that guy.

1323
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,800
You know what I did today?
I get a bad father of the year word.

1324
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:48,800
I let my nine year old watched
the original alien shit.

1325
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:54,000
Nope, she'll you think it was cheesy.
She's okay. She's okay. She's like,

1326
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:56,310
it's not real daddy. If it was a
real thing, I'd be scared of it,

1327
01:20:56,311 --> 01:21:00,050
but I'm not scared to appoint kid. I
love it. Kids, man, they have iPads.

1328
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,490
They get online when you're not looking
at it, can see all kinds of shit,

1329
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:06,620
fucks things up and he knows that
shit next to that. They know things.

1330
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:10,200
Might've daughter used the word, the name
asshole today and I had to scold her,

1331
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:12,770
oh, you should have led with that guy's
an asshole. I was like, hey, write you.

1332
01:21:12,771 --> 01:21:16,540
She said you're right, but don't
tell anybody. Right. But um,

1333
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,160
the thing about the alien
movie is that there's no CGI.

1334
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:24,840
It's all like a mummy can't, it's no,
it's a dude in a suit. So it looks real.

1335
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:28,110
It's fuck, that movie was done so
well. Really? Scott was a wizard.

1336
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,470
They did everything in that dark.
Everything was like real sneaky.

1337
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:34,180
You only saw the alien for
like quick bursts of it.

1338
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:38,250
It's just like American Werewolf in London
with John Landis. You see it and like,

1339
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,990
Ooh, sat control. Did
you see the new alien?

1340
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:48,020
I did not see it yet.
Having a hard time getting people to go.

1341
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,890
No one in my household's capable and my,

1342
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:53,400
my wife said I could let her
watch the original alien on TV,

1343
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:56,720
but I can't take her to the movies
to see the new alien. So yeah,

1344
01:21:56,730 --> 01:22:01,450
wait til it comes down to man. The
wife makes the rules. The flux.

1345
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,920
We were trying to keep all the time,
but we were trying to keep it too.

1346
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,050
We didn't want him, you know, we keep
farming. My wife died. Falling was a bet.

1347
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,260
So we were, we were trying
to keep it to, don't toot.

1348
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:18,850
Oh No, not her. She's got her

1349
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:28,220
eight dash dammit. Whew.
That was a big mistake. Fuck.

1350
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:32,370
That's a huge,
huge victory for her.

1351
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:36,300
Oh my God. Going to get that powerful New
Mexico in the house. Here's the thing,

1352
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:39,840
here's the question. Joe, do you give
heard the, the three against you on it?

1353
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,340
Roads is supposed to be next though.
Oh Shit.

1354
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,780
That was a crazy, ah, she snuck
it under. Go MMA math on that one.

1355
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:50,580
Knows lost to Carolina.

1356
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:55,830
Carolina just got murked Supermar I
was too relaxed my rails with you on.

1357
01:22:56,891 --> 01:23:00,870
It doesn't matter if you're relaxed or
if you look nervous. All that matters.

1358
01:23:00,871 --> 01:23:03,230
It's how your ground
game that does happen.

1359
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:06,160
So you just like pretending
that everything's cool leaning

1360
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,910
against the fence. That ain't
going to, that's not going to wait.

1361
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:16,900
What was the mistake she made there?
Well, you know once it, so first of all,

1362
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:21,610
it's physically a beast.
You're in the first round. No
one's tired. Yes. She turned

1363
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:27,870
towards her. She gave her backup. That's
second grade bullied last yards short.

1364
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,740
It is, man. It's panic
shit. You just like,

1365
01:23:29,741 --> 01:23:33,260
God want muscle my way back up to my
feet. But now she's like, I control it.

1366
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:37,840
That's where it all ends. But she's,
she's controlling here, right?

1367
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,780
She's got her and she's also,
if you her,

1368
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:44,000
she's only got one Bush to go one go
two on one. She's still, she's fine.

1369
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:49,840
And look at that second hook.
Once it was under the chin,

1370
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:53,730
then she goes second hook.
That's deep. Oh yeah.

1371
01:23:53,731 --> 01:23:56,080
That's how she does an
undeniable choke right there.

1372
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:00,690
That's like you go to sleep once that
stuff is the title shot ally. Thanks.

1373
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,840
He dies. Well, I really want to see
rose because we've seen it. Sorry,

1374
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:08,840
Rose Brazilian

1375
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:11,643
girlfriend.

1376
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:19,440
I would like to see her versus rows.
Let's get this started. I was chilling.

1377
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,880
I would say,
oh my foot hurts or an enemy.

1378
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:25,760
And you guys go to therapy

1379
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,680
shortly into random me.
Like I'm good.

1380
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:34,090
I'll just fuck your belt and
you ran it. He's like, yeah,

1381
01:24:34,091 --> 01:24:37,690
I never really wanted to fight one 45
in the first place going on 35 and that

1382
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:41,850
girl arms like you know, let's see Ya.
This is her name. John Judge Jack Young

1383
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:47,290
Jay. Got It. After two years,

1384
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,880
I would say 80% of MMA fans know how to
say her name. Now she's getting famous.

1385
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,530
I say he still calls her
champion Brian Stann.

1386
01:24:55,531 --> 01:24:59,740
He calls her you want to champion this
cause he can't pronounce it one more time.

1387
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,750
You're on jet check. Check. Done judge.

1388
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:05,560
Like young Jamie. No, no, no.

1389
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:08,680
Like why you went and they spell it out
for me phonetically when I still read it

1390
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:11,920
for the Engencia when I have to.
I might be doing it wrong,

1391
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:13,300
but when I have to read it,
uh,

1392
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:18,301
for the Wayans it's like why
you and j a y and then check.

1393
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:21,280
What was your first,
what is your last name?

1394
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:26,040
Start with what's the
first to Jay Jay. Jay, Jay,

1395
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:29,850
Jay, Jay, Jay's CSP. Come on Jj.

1396
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:34,570
What they call her. I know most
people, Young John. Bad idea though.

1397
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:38,320
She's the only Jay Jay other than Jon
Jones. There's one too much confusion,

1398
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:42,310
but the problem is your ingestion sounds
like Jay y. That's like one of them.

1399
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:46,210
Them tight. Once the Thai guy
start flooding into MMA. Oh,

1400
01:25:46,211 --> 01:25:49,840
you thought you had it hard with
the Polish people tie guys come in.

1401
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,880
They got like 35 letters and the
sea for quite some way. Well, why?

1402
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:56,650
We're waiting for the next fight comment.

1403
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:58,450
You guys see what the fuck
tall guys are training.

1404
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,260
You see what pollution going on,
right?

1405
01:26:00,261 --> 01:26:04,070
Did you see what lion fight did they put
this dude Leard Zilla do you know learns

1406
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,500
La? I love his name already. He is a,

1407
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:09,350
he's a multiple world champion.

1408
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:14,800
He has 180 [inaudible] him in
there with a guy who had zero.

1409
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:20,570
No to me.
Moy Tai debut fights leart,

1410
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:24,380
Zillow and gets head kicked
into another fucking dementia.

1411
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,850
Look up there. Look, do
watch this. Look at this.

1412
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:33,920
But Watch. Watch the combination though.
Wash the combination. Do you hit it again,

1413
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:38,640
Jamie? Oh, is it a Instagram wash?
This front kick to the body. Bang.

1414
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:44,240
Kick. Insane. The other guys
in MMA fighter decent record,

1415
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:47,780
he's got like a six and four
or something comparable.

1416
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:53,130
There's a champions
training evolve right now.

1417
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:56,630
Lured Zilla on earth.
Yeah.

1418
01:26:56,631 --> 01:27:01,631
He's got the best Zillow's real name to
relax our shit front kick to the body.

1419
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,580
And then food round kick out of nowhere.
The fuck that guy fight him.

1420
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,850
He was a fake leg kick to the head.
Fake front kick,

1421
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,010
roundhouse kick or they
call question mark kick.

1422
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:17,300
But what happened was a bunch
of people to lion fights. Uh,

1423
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:18,860
this is to,
you know,

1424
01:27:18,861 --> 01:27:22,310
to their credit credit or in
the interest of full disclosure,

1425
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:25,280
they had two people pull out that didn't
want to fight this guy. And I'm like,

1426
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:29,690
fuck that. This guy was making his debut
so I fucking fight him. He's crazy.

1427
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,320
If I was his manager, I said, listen to
me son. That wasn't an MMA fight though,

1428
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:37,880
right? No, no. But it was a guy who
had a record in MMA that was like,

1429
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:41,490
it wasn't good. It was, I mean, it
was a default. The record. Yeah.

1430
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:45,950
He had some losses and he had some
wins, but he wasn't, he wasn't.

1431
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:46,940
Habib never got that off.

1432
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:51,140
And we're not talking about a guy who's
like an elite world class striker and

1433
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:55,840
he's fighting. This guy learned Zillow.
Let me see. Oh, fucking assassin.

1434
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,080
1000 bucks for that and a headache

1435
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:05,200
for a year long headache
Nunez versus that is

1436
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:13,460
come on top. Robert Wilson
car top to bottom Whitaker
and that fight. And he goes,

1437
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:18,080
well, you never know. No, I'm so that's
the main fight. Now that Tj and um,

1438
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:21,870
and Cody are out, you all wins.
And then he beats bear. You

1439
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:24,850
know what the fuck you're talking about.

1440
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,220
Robert Whitaker could
beat anybody in the world.

1441
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,770
He might wait. Mike, you put the
speed. Everybody. Excuse me sir.

1442
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,820
Excuse me gentlemen.
He's paid everybody who's,

1443
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,440
he lost her jock gray got or
you got fucked in that fight.

1444
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,550
He defeated in MMA thinking that right.
Thank you gentlemen.

1445
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:47,270
I haven't said it from day one. World
two time world champion. Wow. Well,

1446
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:48,560
you really picked an underdog brand,

1447
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:53,360
but he is a gorilla when it comes to
wrestling turtle. It's ridiculous. Shred.

1448
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:57,080
They look real. He's going to win the
world title at 40 years old. He might,

1449
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:00,860
he might, or Robert, Robert Winter might
put those fucking kangaroo paws on.

1450
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:05,670
Robert Whitaker's going to
take that fucking right hand
from Australia and knock

1451
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:10,480
his ass. I'm going to need you to
calm down. You got on the train,

1452
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,950
you've got this eighties in Saint
Jacques and arm, which I appreciate it.

1453
01:29:13,951 --> 01:29:17,430
And thanks from early 2000
whatever the new kids on the block,

1454
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:21,330
it'll be new kids on the block. First
of all, I appreciate it. Thank you.

1455
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,170
I admire your courage, your
fashion courtesy. Thank you.

1456
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:27,630
I'm also outraged at the same time.
It's okay in the pot that you did.

1457
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:32,220
You get it for free once he bought it.
We've got a new kid on the block, man.

1458
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:36,450
He got out the new kids on the block
store. They're backed by the way. Okay,

1459
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:39,390
so this is the main event. We're
at the main event already. Yeah,

1460
01:29:39,391 --> 01:29:41,670
it's nine o'clock dude. Oh, you
don't want to fight? We will.

1461
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:46,000
We didn't miss it cause it was on the,
uh, the prelims. But a Sun Sal vs. Dot.

1462
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:50,030
Miralis kid from a world
series of fighting. Oh, what
happened? The Sun's out.

1463
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:54,490
Beat them real and I split decision.
Some people, yeah, we're up.

1464
01:29:54,491 --> 01:29:59,340
People think Mariah's one, but a
sense of beat him. Wow. Interesting.

1465
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,650
Marlon Moraes in my opinion,

1466
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:05,950
was the best hundred 35 pounder in the
world outside of the UFC world series of

1467
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,400
fighting though. Well,
no, but he's really elite.

1468
01:30:08,401 --> 01:30:11,430
If you look at his skill set and the
way he moves and who he's training with,

1469
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:16,230
Ken, retrain, Mark Henry, Frankie Edgar,
Edson Barboza. I mean that's his camp.

1470
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,050
Everyone is so high on a man.
I always,

1471
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:22,200
I'm high on to the hype machine til
you get to the EOC man to beat people.

1472
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:25,250
You're right. But I mean it's his
first fight in the UFC and the son's

1473
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,610
first fight.
But it should be though you're,

1474
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,310
you haven't lost since 2000
like for some shit. True.

1475
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:36,030
But if you are the UFC, if you're, if the
UFC, someone says, look Brendan Schaub,

1476
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:37,470
we're tired of running this.
Take care of this.

1477
01:30:37,471 --> 01:30:40,050
Wouldn't you want to build them up?
I would want to build up Marlin.

1478
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,561
I wouldn't want to,

1479
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:44,280
I would let everybody know how to get
my highlight reel when yeah, me too.

1480
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:48,630
Cause his striking so elite, he was not
bitches out and they need a new content.

1481
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:51,680
Exactly.
You put him in there with a guy who's,

1482
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:57,390
he's a monster, a monster and
he's not that exciting. Yeah.

1483
01:30:57,391 --> 01:31:01,470
You put them in there with a good
hundred 35 pounder who tests them.

1484
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:03,810
But you know what man,
that's how guys lose.

1485
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:06,240
And that's why you find out who they are.
I mean that's what happened.

1486
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:10,080
Sergio Pettis, right fought Alex Cause
Sarah's they through right to the wolves.

1487
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,050
And because Sarah's chokes him
out and you realize like, okay,

1488
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,920
like you got some shit to learn kid.
Yeah you're fucking talented. But Hey,

1489
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:21,430
try to frank kegger a year and
biggest thing, uh, you know,

1490
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,010
uh,
who do you have in this fight?

1491
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:26,070
Because you tend to be
scientific about your pick. Man.

1492
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:29,150
This one's so tough to pick cause
it Joe say it's so tough to,

1493
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:32,790
it's fucking Josie all though. But I
just for yourselves Max Holloway's time,

1494
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,820
I feel like his box and he's bigger Max.

1495
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:38,340
Holloway's very smart and he's very,

1496
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:42,700
very like fluid with his movements.
He moves in and out really good.

1497
01:31:42,701 --> 01:31:45,330
He stays in the outside, he'd do
anything. Here's the question,

1498
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:49,110
but how's he going to deal with
all those leg kicks? Big Question.

1499
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,490
And it goes to the ground.

1500
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:52,800
People forget all those up fucking
world champion on the ground.

1501
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:58,170
Although built cold, he beat [inaudible]
in a regular Jiu Jitsu match.

1502
01:31:58,830 --> 01:31:59,980
Everyone forgets about his grappling.

1503
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,370
He's such a beast of a striker.

1504
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:05,350
Ways that can be trouble for Holloway
cause just wants to fucking strike.

1505
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,400
And I think a lot of it depends
on like where is Aldo at mentally.

1506
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:12,250
Well he just kept off the Frankie
Edgar fight. He looked fantastic.

1507
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:16,540
But before that was talking
about retirement remarry,
retired, true play soccer.

1508
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:19,300
That might've been an asshole is
all in though Max. Always all in.

1509
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:23,710
What else is in trout max?
Max Hallway in a Steve Bay is these guys,

1510
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:27,140
they just run their camps like
he's not in that some super camera.

1511
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:30,220
Why is he holding a British flag up when
he's from Hawaii? You son of a bitch.

1512
01:32:30,221 --> 01:32:35,020
That's the Hawaiian you. Oh my God.
Even know if he had been in Hawaii.

1513
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:39,520
Can Can we meet? Meet with Mike for that.
You never been to Hawaii? [inaudible]

1514
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,010
Shit. Never. Never. Australia and
never who? I had never sat down there.

1515
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,460
Fuck everywhere.
I've been to all those email.

1516
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:50,440
When you talk all this shit about
traveling to come to my world,

1517
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,200
I will probably try to top track
one tune in tomorrow night. Yeah.

1518
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,400
Don't talk travel when Henry Rollins
don't feel like a townie. God,

1519
01:32:57,401 --> 01:32:59,590
that guy's been around, hasn't it?
You know what he does every year?

1520
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,640
Picks a spot on the map. It go like
that. Bali causes far as travel agent.

1521
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,050
What can we were going on?
Bali.

1522
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,800
He just flies out to Bali by himself
with a laptop and a camera pair of

1523
01:33:08,801 --> 01:33:11,410
underwear.
Toothbrush just lives there.

1524
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,820
That's good denture boy already do the
same thing back. Ari went super deep.

1525
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:19,650
You wouldn't even deeper. He went for four
months. Ours like, I'll show you much.

1526
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,030
I'll shoot over the wrong.

1527
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:28,750
If you're looking for why fight and
your destination, you're not trapped.

1528
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:33,310
Ari Shaffir stressing the fuck
your Wifi. Fuck your phone.

1529
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:37,820
If you really want to travel, really
can't. You've travel with a funk.

1530
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:42,460
I travel all the time and I like,
I'd rather stay home.

1531
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,930
Once you travel to a thousand cities,
you realize it's an illusion.

1532
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,180
Everyone's trying to
travel to where I live.

1533
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,750
People are coming from Australia and I'm
going to fucking Tahiti, French brother.

1534
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,330
You're walking through the airport
and you see the destination,

1535
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:02,130
the be all end all, some dude's
feet on a fucking bad ass beach.

1536
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,730
That's, that's the the goal.
And then when you get there,

1537
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:10,150
you realize, wait a
minute, that cutting off,

1538
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:13,930
they framed off like the people trying
to sell you a fucking a crocodile

1539
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:19,070
unloading [inaudible].

1540
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:28,240
Dot. That's right. Dot.
I went to Thailand. I go,

1541
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:31,090
I'm going to go to the desert of fucking
island on Thailand, and everyone said,

1542
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:33,910
yeah, you can. I go where they go,
you need to fucking take a cap.

1543
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:37,840
Three hours jumped in a cab, three hours
I'm gone. And then we finally get to go,

1544
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:41,080
what are the islands? Oh, you want to go
to the island? Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking,

1545
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:44,650
I don't give a fuck how much it
costs. It's just go. It's cheaper.

1546
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:48,190
If you go on a big ferry to this island
or you could take a speed boat to go

1547
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:52,550
fucking speed boat and let's go, boom. I'm
video taping. Everybody wants to speak.

1548
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,830
I want to go on this fucking
ion that I see at the,

1549
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:02,360
I see him all the time. I don't give a
fuck. I'm getting book money and Shit.

1550
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,870
I don't give a shit. Fuck
Thailand nonstop. I go,

1551
01:35:05,871 --> 01:35:08,960
I'm going to go on a fucking
island. You get there, boom,

1552
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:13,640
and there's 200 other people there
and there's like snack bars and shit.

1553
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:15,650
The secret is

1554
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,730
the island.
There was a Tracy,

1555
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:27,400
it was a trick. I spend all
day finding this fucking I did.

1556
01:35:27,401 --> 01:35:31,010
I was on a speed boat thinking they were
going to take me to this island and he

1557
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:33,860
remembered I was going to eat alone.
Beat boy Jason from England.

1558
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:38,000
The mole Deeves got to go to the mall.
Deeves Jesus Christ.

1559
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:43,160
Hey, did you see Josie Aldo in
Brazil? He has a restaurant.

1560
01:35:43,161 --> 01:35:47,240
It's just American burgers in Brazil.
Really just cheeseburger.

1561
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:50,570
It's called famous
burgers that's ridiculous.

1562
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:56,000
Famous and he sells cheeseburgers. Hey
man, is that cultural appropriation?

1563
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:58,210
Because a bunch of chicks
got roundly Hartland.

1564
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:00,920
These girls got ran out of
Portland because they were
white and they were making

1565
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:04,460
burritos. Yeah, because the United
States is called the appropriation.

1566
01:36:04,461 --> 01:36:07,040
That's how you get better at and I don't
want a white girl making my burrito.

1567
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:10,400
Brian's about to go Fox News on us here.
I was a Korea,

1568
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:14,180
Korea.
They got a Mexican joint curry.

1569
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:17,620
They play fucking Mexican
music making the Burritos,

1570
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:20,660
make it Mexican food.

1571
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:25,610
If we ever do a fight companion that's
like in Europe or something like that.

1572
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:26,444
It's on the weekend.

1573
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,380
I got to take you guys to a real
legit Mexican joint down the street.

1574
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:35,030
Do they have like, yeah.
Okay, here's a super legit,

1575
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:39,620
you order for us is a super legit Mexican
joint down the street where like every,

1576
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:43,940
all the, all the TV is in
Spanish. All the music is Mexican.

1577
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,790
The beep of Bailey speaking
you could barely order,

1578
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:51,770
you'll be the only you and I in him will
be the only English speaking people in

1579
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:55,850
the room. It's fucking tremendous. Totally
eat. So like girls Muto on the weekend.

1580
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:58,850
Ooh, I can't stand the legit minuto. Hey,

1581
01:36:58,851 --> 01:37:01,060
why did these guys all have Bahrainian
on what's going on over here?

1582
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:06,020
Super Skeptical eyes guys.
What's going on with the Guardian Angels?

1583
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:12,610
That makes shit like I was raised
with the Mexican like no it wasn't.

1584
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:16,430
We didn't go. We went to
Mcdonald's. When my mom, we're like,

1585
01:37:16,431 --> 01:37:20,000
we're going to all those ram
going to Mexican restaurants.
Yeah. Yeah. It's two d.

1586
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:23,050
He looks tremendous.
Like physically, dude,

1587
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:25,440
he looks as good as he's ever loved her.
That looks like,

1588
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,250
although when he fought Chad Mendez,
when it first, what are you saying?

1589
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:30,800
It looks fantastic.
It looks like he's motivated.

1590
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:34,610
I'm not saying shit about steroids bro.
It looks like a cheeseburger.

1591
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:39,080
Then say Shit Eddie. I didn't say
shit but just by asking what he meant,

1592
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:40,460
he looks tremendous.
That was cute.

1593
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:44,510
I will squeeze sale is very strict I
think for the good, for a guy like Aldo.

1594
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:47,270
Well who's been the champion
besides Conor McGregor?

1595
01:37:47,271 --> 01:37:50,600
There's only been one ever
145 pound champion in the UFC.

1596
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:53,630
That's that guy you're looking at
right now. So with a guy like that,

1597
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,640
I think many times it's
a battle of motivation.

1598
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:00,270
Yeah. I mean he's so dominant and
he's been in the game for so long.

1599
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,310
And here's the crazy shit. He's only 30,
unbelievable all the years that Joe's,

1600
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,740
although has been dominating
and you think about it,

1601
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:12,330
I mean there's the guy who beat Frankie
Edgar right first time and then beats

1602
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:16,080
them again the second time. Maybe even
cleaner, maybe even better. Right?

1603
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:21,120
Think about all the people that if I do
the Chad Mendez fight the second fight,

1604
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,390
a war, uh, the more common

1605
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:31,930
toma, but that was also when he was
having a hard time making that weight.

1606
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:36,840
That was when we did that press conference
the day before the fight and it was

1607
01:38:36,841 --> 01:38:40,710
the day of the weigh ins and he could
barely be on the ds because he was so

1608
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:44,900
weakened by the weight cut cause he
hadn't weighed in yet. I think all go.

1609
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:49,170
I mean the crazy thing is he's always
going to be judged by that Conor McGregor

1610
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:52,320
fight she's picked up, which it's kind
of crazy. I don't judge him for that.

1611
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:56,580
Fuck that. But it is what it is, but
you kind of have to higher profile.

1612
01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:00,300
Finer showed that a guy
can come in at both guys.

1613
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:04,980
Talented is Connor can come in and first
of all fuck with his head with Connor.

1614
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:06,780
Absolutely did get inside of his head,

1615
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:10,740
create a lot of stress for me and a
lot of pressure forcing a rush and then

1616
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:15,570
Conor just relaxes fuck slides out of
the way and drops that left hand bomb on

1617
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:18,030
them. Here's a question for
you guys. He solved the puzzle.

1618
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:21,120
What happens if Holly comes there and
merge some of the first round with his

1619
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:23,970
striking, then it's going to really
taint his legacy. Here's the,

1620
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:28,350
was never fought any really, really good
striker set for Conner. Uh, Holloway.

1621
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:29,100
Thinking more.

1622
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:33,970
What happens if Aldo kicks the shit out
of his legs and has him hobbling and

1623
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,750
Roblin really early and
winds up stopping him?

1624
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:40,530
Do you have another Conor
fight and we just go up to 55.

1625
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:44,280
Does he go up to 50 shit cause he wants
to see Dana had Dana goes just to get

1626
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:46,560
him to commit to this. I have to have
a serious talk with Mike Connors.

1627
01:39:46,561 --> 01:39:49,440
Never going to fight. You got to
move on. Like that's never happening.

1628
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:52,560
It's so crazy.
Connor makeup fucking hunter.

1629
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:56,340
Do gillion dollars fighting Floyd and
then come back and take on a fight against

1630
01:39:56,341 --> 01:39:58,560
Joseph.
You're right,

1631
01:39:58,561 --> 01:40:02,570
but is a guy that just fought
Eddie Alvarez a year ago. Right.

1632
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:07,820
And you've got to remember the result
of what happens with Mayweather is huge

1633
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:13,020
like Mayweather. But let's just say
that on the off chance that may,

1634
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:17,510
whether just just, just merch, some it
just doesn't get hit. Not even once.

1635
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:21,200
And after that Connor's going
to come back with a fury. Yeah.

1636
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:24,300
He's gonna come back with the theory
to the UFC and say, fuck boxing.

1637
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:27,150
I'm going to come back
and this is my sport.

1638
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:32,280
If he makes it to a decision, he
looks tough. He won't be tainted.

1639
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:36,210
It all depends on what happens.
If he loses super played with,

1640
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,610
he's going to come back
to the UFC with a fury.

1641
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:43,410
But if he goes to the decision,
like you were saying,

1642
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,640
it's a win for him and it's close right
at the top time when for us, no he not.

1643
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:48,474
Even if it's,

1644
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,400
there's no way Connor would
ever let Floyd survive.

1645
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:57,340
But hold on it.
If they had a five round MMA fight,

1646
01:40:57,341 --> 01:41:01,420
let's all agree Floyd Mayweather would
never fucking survived despite a chance

1647
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:04,630
in hell. They would need, there's there's,
there's a chance, there's a very, very,

1648
01:41:04,631 --> 01:41:06,540
very,
very not unlike chance that he reimbursed.

1649
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:09,700
You have to bring you guys to the
attention of the great no choice.

1650
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:13,220
We have to watch this fight and give
it the respect it deserves and listen,

1651
01:41:13,221 --> 01:41:16,030
settle down. No, I won't settle
down because this is a very Cyril,

1652
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:19,480
depends on what kind of take down
training yard take down defense training.

1653
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:20,140
Floyd Mayweather.

1654
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:25,140
Mayweather puts himself through the
delusional kind of training or the real

1655
01:41:26,201 --> 01:41:29,560
legit take down. It's good point.
That's a good point. Cause they go,

1656
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:34,830
do they go for 50 74564505454
if you're sinking,

1657
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,390
it's one of the best matches for the year.

1658
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:40,910
If not the best feeling each other out.

1659
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:48,030
How nervous are they built? Max Holloway
looks very smooth and relaxed. So does,

1660
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,290
although everybody looks good.
No one's doing that.

1661
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:55,160
Then I just want to see Holloway's
answer for those lake cake.

1662
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:59,140
Well, the thing is Holloway's very
clever. He's not going to rush in man.

1663
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:02,530
Like you see the way he fought,
Jeremy Stephens mean he adapts.

1664
01:42:02,531 --> 01:42:03,940
So we fought cub Swanson.

1665
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:07,120
One of the more interesting things
about Holloway's because he talks,

1666
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:11,440
you know he's like a cool Hawaiian kid.
Like people kind of sleep on that.

1667
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:15,940
Like they think of Hawaiians is being
like fun loving like Surfing Party and

1668
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:19,630
people. You don't just mean j pen.
Yeah, I know what I'm saying. I know,

1669
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:24,330
but there's something about like the
way he talks almost something about,

1670
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:27,740
it's almost like you'd think he's just
so nervous right now is BJ telling them

1671
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:31,330
are coming back? Yes. You're still
fighting, fighting fucking homeboy.

1672
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:35,230
Dennis Seaver and Dennis
was doing too much.

1673
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:40,530
Bj can still have some awesome fights,
but Yahya was just not the right match up.

1674
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:44,170
Hey, hey, this, although look like his
himself right now or is he look nervous?

1675
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:47,800
Oh he looks perfect. Nothing's
happened right now. He's just moving.

1676
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:49,840
See He is probably aware of that.

1677
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:53,770
Max Holloway wants him to commit and
Max wants to counter. Max Is Taller,

1678
01:42:53,771 --> 01:42:57,580
longer fighter and he's also,
max is very good at not loading up.

1679
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,320
If you ever watch max hallways fights,

1680
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:03,280
he throws things very precise for the
most part me and he'll load up if he can,

1681
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,920
if he can get away with it.
But he's like by attrition,

1682
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,200
he's just very technical
with his striking.

1683
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:11,980
He doesn't have a lot of super straight.
Yes, exactly. Straight punches.

1684
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:15,910
He doesn't have a lot of fat and its
movements and because he's a long tall guy

1685
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:19,570
that makes up for it means so much.
He's got long tall,

1686
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:22,600
which is great and then he also
has like super efficient movement.

1687
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:24,130
He's hard to hit. It's hard to hit. Yeah,

1688
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,520
he's really hard to get like a clean
punch out. Super hard to hit any,

1689
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:33,100
he's fucking smart. Max Holloway's
fight Iq is very high, super high,

1690
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:37,470
and they crazy doesn't come from the super
camp either, but he just a holy book.

1691
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:40,390
He clipped all the right there with
that left hook and he also knows how

1692
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:42,670
dangerous all those leg kicks are.
So right now,

1693
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:46,220
oh shit.
Oh

1694
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:49,220
Shit.

1695
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:53,930
Oh my gosh. They all know how
those are higher shit on fire.

1696
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,580
Oh my God. Couple Lion. Oh
my God. She's see, forget,

1697
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:02,010
forget how good.
Although

1698
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:08,060
I remember when he hit Chad Mendez with
the Duchy with that left hook to the

1699
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:11,600
body of that right leg kick and you
watch them do it and you go, oh Jesus.

1700
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:15,580
Max Holloway weathered that storm.
Whether that fucker he did cheese,

1701
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:17,240
his eyes are wide open chat.

1702
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:20,690
Should we come back any now
right off the suspension? Yeah.

1703
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:25,740
Do you know what his
suspension was for? No. Well,

1704
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:29,420
no. It was for something that he
used for psoriasis or some shit.

1705
01:44:29,421 --> 01:44:30,500
They test the Shamira.

1706
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:35,270
There's something in some psoriasis
medication that makes you piss hot new.

1707
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:39,650
I sound like a fucking Alpha male
apologist right there. Don't I? Shit.

1708
01:44:39,651 --> 01:44:42,250
PDS. No, Brendon, no. Thrive.

1709
01:44:42,251 --> 01:44:46,190
Even though Chad Mendez could jump out
of a fucking five foot pool and he's only

1710
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:50,930
five foot seven. He's, he's a, he
is a freak, super freak athlete.

1711
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:57,830
But for real, that is what he said. And I
believe him. I cared my, he does have it.

1712
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:58,491
I know he does it.

1713
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:01,220
Have these like a lot of photos with
it where you could see it on his skin.

1714
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:04,020
And I know that steroids are a
way that uh, the handle that shit,

1715
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,730
but if you just put that on the thing,
you might be all right. G h our PS,

1716
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:11,210
what it was before it came out of,
he had no idea what it was.

1717
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:13,490
Man Does explained to them.
The test results came back.

1718
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:15,860
They told me I tested positive. I was
like, I don't even know what that is.

1719
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:18,230
Bunch of research sucks.
I love Chad.

1720
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:23,090
It says Roy is used to
treat plaque psoriasis,

1721
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,460
skin condition he's been
dealing with for years. Fuck.

1722
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,490
So it seems legitimate Chad. Yeah, he's
fucking, you sought a relaxed. Yeah,

1723
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:34,260
but his God do Max Hein got take it?
Yeah.

1724
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:38,570
He called Max Holloway. Dung
them back. This is fucking,

1725
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:42,690
Ooh. I'll tell you what does a huge speed
advantage on all those sites. Although,

1726
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:47,120
so goddamn explosive. He's so
good at closing the gap, man.

1727
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:50,510
Like you remember that Mendez knee, he
landed in their first fight. Oh my God.

1728
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:51,640
Ooh.

1729
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,640
I wrote, I'll never forget
calling the Uriah faber fight.

1730
01:45:55,690 --> 01:46:00,110
Got Uriah Faber fight was one of the
most horrific displays of leg kicks.

1731
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,570
Worst thing in the world. Who
are, I said he wanted a faint.

1732
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:05,090
He was trying not to faint from the pain.
That's what he said.

1733
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:10,400
How tough is Uriah toughest? The toughest.
I didn't [inaudible] Hall of fame.

1734
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,640
Never quit. Now Tie sky. We
broke both his hands against her.

1735
01:46:13,641 --> 01:46:16,790
Fucking Mike Brown kept fighting and kept
fighting. Nobody tougher than that guy,

1736
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:17,810
but you don't get tougher.

1737
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:19,500
Okay.

1738
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:23,340
Did first round first he
documented the damage to his leg.

1739
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:27,450
Oh my God. Oh, backs hall with the
math. That doesn't work on Josie.

1740
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:28,711
What would it worked?

1741
01:46:28,711 --> 01:46:33,711
So there's something in psoriasis that
shows up in the head of the treatment for

1742
01:46:34,861 --> 01:46:38,940
psoriasis, something in the treatment
that shows up. Man, that'd be a good idea.

1743
01:46:38,941 --> 01:46:42,050
I had to get on some juice of,
hey listen, go get it dyke.

1744
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:43,820
Go get a prescription for this stuff.
So

1745
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:51,360
right away that was brilliant.
But I cured my psoriasis.

1746
01:46:51,361 --> 01:46:54,130
I have plaque psoriasis and I cured. I
don't know what happened, but I just,

1747
01:46:54,170 --> 01:46:57,550
you're sucking a lot. You could
do steroids sucking. Strange.

1748
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,410
John's out 12 and then

1749
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:07,130
no. And then I heard you were
sucking Dick stopped eating, uh,

1750
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,400
taking a touching cow, dairy. And uh,

1751
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,710
there's this book you ever read that book
called the plant paradox about lectins.

1752
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,230
Really good book about psoriasis.
Yeah.

1753
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:21,670
Well there certainly the bone psoriasis,

1754
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:26,610
but if you had psoriasis like he did,
that's a reason to read it. Yeah.

1755
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,250
It literally these recommended
no, no, it literally,

1756
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:38,910
I get up my shades,
I get on my legs shorts.

1757
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:44,340
So we all agree. We all agree
the Boldo one, that first round,

1758
01:47:44,341 --> 01:47:48,840
fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Right? Yeah. That
book number 10, eight two. He looks good.

1759
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:53,940
It looks good. Cool. Oh, fucking
sneaky. Left Hook to the body, man.

1760
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,000
Although one of the best ever,
ever,

1761
01:47:57,001 --> 01:47:59,910
ever still that sneaky left
hook to the body is no joke.

1762
01:47:59,911 --> 01:48:02,460
And he follows it up with that right
leg kick a lot. And by the way,

1763
01:48:02,461 --> 01:48:06,290
he hasn't thrown any of them yet. I
know. Not One, no, he doesn't want to

1764
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:11,550
one hobby. But that's the same thing
that happened with Frankie Edgar.

1765
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,820
See a lot of people anticipate the idea
that all those going to try to take them

1766
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,880
to get some serious fucking hands.

1767
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:21,650
And when he knows he's not going to kick
you but you think he might keep you,

1768
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,400
then it opens up his hand.
She has it too dude.

1769
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:28,290
And His hands are no fucking joke because
he's so much faster. The Holloway,

1770
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:33,060
the Tude, all those hands are like
lightning. He's, he's been talking lately.

1771
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:35,820
I mean I would like to
find out how serious he is,

1772
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,450
but he's been talking about lately
about possibly one day fighting and pro

1773
01:48:39,451 --> 01:48:42,510
boxing. That's not out of
the question. Oh my God,

1774
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:48,990
he's going to 55 I think probably for me
at 45 let's be, well, I mean who knows,

1775
01:48:48,991 --> 01:48:50,820
man. I mean, he seems to be this.

1776
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:53,730
If he makes it through five
rounds looking like this,

1777
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:58,590
we've got to shut the fuck up cause
he made 45 and he's like, oh my God,

1778
01:48:58,591 --> 01:49:01,050
doesn't matter.
He's looking fantastic and less.

1779
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,510
They can make a case for him to fight
Mcgregor. He 55 they should. Yes.

1780
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:09,540
If 55 deep supercars never
coming down to 45 for him.

1781
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:13,230
But I would feel like if I
was, if I was all though, look,

1782
01:49:13,231 --> 01:49:17,160
you have to be co undeniable.
Oh my God. And at 30 years old,

1783
01:49:17,161 --> 01:49:21,300
he can become undeniable still. He's
still, I mean to us, to the hardcore fans,

1784
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,760
he's undenying undeniable.

1785
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:26,730
But in order to sell that big paper view
that would make Connor want to catch

1786
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:30,270
her breath, get your revenge.
He's got a merch. Everybody. Yeah.

1787
01:49:30,271 --> 01:49:34,290
He's got to become this guy like Gennady
Golovkin like we're to the point where

1788
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:36,660
like Canelo had to fight him.

1789
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:41,350
Everybody keeps talking about Golovkin
go up and go walking. Oh good.

1790
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:46,740
What happens if Josie Aldo came up and
fought fucking cubbies or Tony Ferguson

1791
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,880
worked them crazy. Connor almost forced
to crazy. Yeah. It's talking shit.

1792
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:55,220
Yeah, and Merck and Tony.
I'll tell you that much.

1793
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:56,890
I knew you were going to say that.
I'm just saying.

1794
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,640
Oh No, it's too much. Oh no, he's missing.

1795
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,990
I feel like Tony is so
fucking durable and so nasty.

1796
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:11,660
Just like such a natural fighter.
He is to be so game,

1797
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:16,390
but also super smart.
Super Skillful and disciplined is,

1798
01:50:16,391 --> 01:50:19,500
fuck. Tony's a handful for
anybody. Anybody, anybody.

1799
01:50:19,501 --> 01:50:22,250
I need to see him in fucking
could be fine. And I know, man.

1800
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,170
You know what Tony should just ask
him like, hey man, what do you weigh?

1801
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:30,940
65 let's just fire you.
Don't die. Don't die.

1802
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,560
Oh,
oh

1803
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:39,960
punches. I don't have any
tag. I'm actually, oh, oh

1804
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:46,620
man. It's beautiful to have that. Very
best can not a whole lot of kicking folks.

1805
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,230
Cause I didn't just say as a phrase is
going to catch her right hand if he kicks.

1806
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:52,860
Although I mean,
I'll tell you what though.

1807
01:50:52,861 --> 01:50:55,170
Max is showing his fight Iq man,
he's,

1808
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:58,290
he's showing his fight Iq click how he's
stretching those arms out in front of

1809
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:02,190
them. He's, he's giving that
doubt. Good. Connor is he'd
beat both these dudes. Yeah,

1810
01:51:02,670 --> 01:51:05,100
but also like you see how he's doing that?
First of all,

1811
01:51:05,101 --> 01:51:09,780
he's doing it totally legal code
head. Oh God. With the right.

1812
01:51:09,781 --> 01:51:13,800
Again, this is crazy. Hey Connor, beat
him to with a torn knee, by the way.

1813
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:17,910
I don't want to hear about that. Oh,
body kick Dan, they're going off now.

1814
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:22,860
Ooh Man. Strong kick to the
body. Bags back. Holy Shit.

1815
01:51:22,861 --> 01:51:23,550
We'll fight.

1816
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:28,550
What a fight Matt want that Max has a
motherfucking savage was all though,

1817
01:51:30,401 --> 01:51:35,220
man. You know what? If you take away that
one punch by Connor is the best ever.

1818
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:40,000
He's pampered. Found number one crazy.
I would say it's crazy. Did take that,

1819
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:43,320
but he did take that hit ain't done
a bit so you know what it is, man.

1820
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:45,180
It's like here's a
puzzle to every fighter.

1821
01:51:45,181 --> 01:51:49,920
The question is did he seal that puzzle
problem up that little hole that Connor

1822
01:51:49,921 --> 01:51:54,090
founded? These seal that up. Any
fights kind? We won't know. Damn it.

1823
01:51:54,091 --> 01:51:57,990
They have to fight. That could be
fine. If you were the head of the UFC,

1824
01:51:57,991 --> 01:52:01,500
would you be like, listen, we got to
make this happen boys? No, I let you do.

1825
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,380
I would have Conner probably fight
GSP forced on him fight Florida. GSP

1826
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:12,030
want people to be educated.
I want Oh, nice jam man.

1827
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:16,260
I want people to feel about sites
and the way we feel about fights.

1828
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,470
You know what I'm saying? I
hear you. I got one people

1829
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:27,090
hands up. Hands down. Oh.

1830
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,610
Oh Man. Slash bitch slapped him. Oh Shit.

1831
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,170
Oh well you be careful.

1832
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,240
Max was trying to give them the
up and I'll know. Turn his back.

1833
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,940
So Max lost a psychological war there.

1834
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:53,510
He gave a thumbs up to do on his
back to him. That's not good,

1835
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,880
right? Max Holloway's that
guy though, you think? Oh, uh,

1836
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:06,610
yeah. I mean probably right. If you had
a guest, he's down. He's down for sure.

1837
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:12,440
It's clean. That's quick.
Clean. He looks good.

1838
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:18,610
I love it. I love it. I love
it. And look and see that.

1839
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:23,160
Oh, he gave the thumb to
his back. Never win a case.

1840
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,750
You gotta be quick Paul.
No fucking cheese.

1841
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,160
And you've got a double and you meet
might need to walk towards him after that.

1842
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:34,110
Yeah, right. Yeah. You gotta you gotta
you might come up with a game plan.

1843
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:38,140
No stool in between rounds now.
Yup. No, no, it's dangerous is,

1844
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:42,380
although he's got high level chokes.
Oh yeah,

1845
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:48,900
man.
I'm not mad.

1846
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:52,840
I thought about,
he's Jujitsu going on here at all.

1847
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:56,450
I'm going to and mustache
bodied up in this great head.

1848
01:53:56,451 --> 01:54:00,110
Mr. Steal your girl at that picture.
Right?

1849
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,140
Okay, so here's the question. We're
in the round three now, right?

1850
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:10,790
It's four 44 max down to the
speed I would say. Right?

1851
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:14,120
If you had to look at this scorecard,
but interesting rounds, right?

1852
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,180
The Max has got his both guys
who've gotten things off,

1853
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:18,830
but all though it looks fucking sensation,

1854
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:21,410
the second rounds will inch in
the first round. I was like, well,

1855
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:24,200
mixed bucket span and please
make a tee shirts. You're crazy.

1856
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:27,860
I was interested in the first round.
I'm saying that first round though,

1857
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:29,120
Max really got outclassed.

1858
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:31,990
I don't think there was something
that was a big long period.

1859
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:35,840
The beginning of where was waiting for
somebody to move true and then although

1860
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,150
eventually got the best of the exchanges,

1861
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:42,890
he's just showing some really nice levels
trying to get them back kicked back to

1862
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:46,350
what the, Oh nope. He's letting him
out. Oh my God. This is some, oh,

1863
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:50,330
here's the other thing you got.
How many wars?

1864
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:54,430
All those already been in a real fight.

1865
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:57,830
They took a lot out of them as the
Chad Mendez thing though. I mean,

1866
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,760
and also Connor, he's had
to Ricardo, Ricardo, lamas,

1867
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:04,070
fight lamas had him on his
back and he's punched him.

1868
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:07,230
Dominic [inaudible] crazy,

1869
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:11,350
but he was on antibiotics when he was
a shit's getting knocked guide yet.

1870
01:55:11,590 --> 01:55:12,540
Brendan,
please

1871
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:24,830
both of them all with that.
Sweet. Neat. I know. I don't know.

1872
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:28,460
I'm hating on all though.
I don't get it. Oh,

1873
01:55:28,461 --> 01:55:31,040
I max the wind for some reason.
You know what?

1874
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:34,970
One of the best things that's
ever happened at a being
a commentator is learning

1875
01:55:34,971 --> 01:55:38,830
how to appreciate just a performance.
It's got favorites.

1876
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:43,010
I always had favorites, man.
Always when I was early. Right.

1877
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:44,190
I try

1878
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:48,610
not to now, but like if somebody that I'm
friends with like of cowboy fights, oh,

1879
01:55:48,611 --> 01:55:51,980
it's the worst. It's hard. It's hard
for me. Very, very hard for me to call.

1880
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,790
Your fights were the hardest
I've ever had a call.

1881
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:56,550
Really hundred percent so
hard as I've ever had a call.

1882
01:55:56,610 --> 01:56:01,390
So you have to like decide
like, oh, oh my God.

1883
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:04,170
Oh, he's hurting. It's not over yet.

1884
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:12,630
Oh my God. Oh my God. Hello?

1885
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:19,910
Oh, she'll grappling going on
right. Tagged him again. Oh,

1886
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:25,600
let him up. I'll do is let them
hire street. Oh my goodness.

1887
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:29,420
Make him get up Max and knocked
him out. Oh, what heart? Heart.

1888
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:32,830
Heart is right heart by
Aldo to survive this.

1889
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:37,140
He's too his Jujitsu,
but side your trolls.

1890
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:41,530
Look at this alive. Oh
Shit. He's so battered, man.

1891
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,640
Oh,
Halloween.

1892
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:47,770
Oh my goodness.

1893
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:53,640
No more burger joints. Oh
fuck man. Dude. He might,

1894
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:58,770
you never know what the fuck it now I
know. No more burger joints. Think Max is

1895
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:07,430
trying to sneak out the back door. What
did you get to try and do is use. Oh,

1896
01:57:08,670 --> 01:57:13,480
he's showing under the chin. He's
got it. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1897
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:18,580
Oh my God,
Dude.

1898
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:26,560
This dude is hurting a lot of time.
Oh my God.

1899
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:29,470
What's rough is that, oh, that's a big
job. And he knows what he's doing. Oh,

1900
01:57:29,471 --> 01:57:34,000
head arm. Drag it all the time. The
wrong, right. Arm's the wrong spot. Oh,

1901
01:57:35,730 --> 01:57:39,570
well this is, if he just pours it on
right now, he's going to stop. Come on.

1902
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:44,410
No, no, no, no. Oh my goodness.
He's defending. Oh my goodness.

1903
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:49,930
Get the arm. Get the arm. Does a
cover up. Cover up now what now?

1904
01:57:49,931 --> 01:57:54,100
What is it he's going to say?
Defend Yourself. Defend your no,

1905
01:57:54,101 --> 01:57:55,120
GC and I'm good.

1906
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:56,580
Okay.

1907
01:57:56,580 --> 01:58:00,360
I often hear that last fight,
but when I shut up and yet,

1908
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:06,400
oh,
oh wow.

1909
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:11,510
Oh my gosh.
Oh my God.

1910
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:16,320
Holy Shit.
Hawaii finally gets the rural champ.

1911
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:20,970
God Damn fucking Hawaii.
Holy Shit. Max Holloway.

1912
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,600
You know what, man? Aldo,

1913
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:27,930
he's shaking his head because he still
wanted to be able to fight and it's a

1914
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:31,350
referee's called the stop, the fight,
and he, he's very upset about that.

1915
01:58:31,351 --> 01:58:35,370
He was stuck, but man,
it seemed legit to me.

1916
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:40,360
That was a legit stoppage. It seemed
legit to me. I see my intelligent, oh,

1917
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,030
you know it's legit.
Eddie had

1918
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,870
cruelty. Oh yeah. You think it's legit,
right? Yeah, I do. Yeah, I would.

1919
01:58:46,871 --> 01:58:49,980
I would imagine there could be.
You have to protect the,

1920
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:55,150
the road I liked. I liked that.
That big John let it go that long.

1921
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:02,260
But you rarely see he took a beating
for like two minutes straight.

1922
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,170
Yup. Yup. Came back, man. You got tagged

1923
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:12,730
so hard, man. She sees what he goes
through, man. What an incredible fight.

1924
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:14,440
Madison.
Oh,

1925
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:19,040
let him jump in the
fucking flag flag, man. No,

1926
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:22,960
there's this family that flew all the
way from Hawaii. My where's the rock?

1927
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:25,090
What the fuck up man?

1928
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:30,100
You got a world champion in Hawaii
like Cleveland. We got a world champ.

1929
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:34,360
Cleveland. We got to world
chesty pay. That's right.

1930
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:38,940
That's one of my all time favorite. A guy
who just won the title things is steep.

1931
01:59:38,941 --> 01:59:43,840
Emile chick did Cleveland's, he
said he ran out onto the cage.

1932
01:59:43,841 --> 01:59:48,570
He couldn't believe it after
he knocked out his last fight.

1933
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:54,160
Kelly. Right? You like him?
You like machine gun? Kelly

1934
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:59,740
say something nice or say nothing at all.
Hey listen,

1935
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,280
there's a serious movement in Cleveland.
Yeah, well listen, Cleveland is a,

1936
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,200
I had a great fucking time.

1937
02:00:05,201 --> 02:00:07,680
We did a UFC in Cleveland just
a little while ago and I did.

1938
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:12,580
I did a show there in Cleveland.
I had a fucking great time,
man. They're fun, Dude.

1939
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:16,720
That clip that city's coming back to
life. Hawaii, Whitney lucky and come back.

1940
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:21,340
Let's look at this big
bang. Boom. Come on.

1941
02:00:21,341 --> 02:00:25,570
Sign drops him with that
right hand. Nothing fancy. Is
it the one to the one, two.

1942
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:28,780
Beautiful timing though, man. Beautiful
timing. Look at this. Look at that.

1943
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:32,770
Oh my timing with that
right hand is perfection.

1944
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:35,140
He's on top of him dropping bombs on him.

1945
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:38,980
There was a couple of times in the fight
where it looks like it looked like Aldo

1946
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:43,180
went out, but his will, his will and
his need to fucking get through this.

1947
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:44,980
Like right there, Bang. Come on man.

1948
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:50,560
Is to be Josie Aldo once in that kind of
freak fight with Conor to beat him like

1949
02:00:51,281 --> 02:00:54,220
this. I mean, Max Holloway
beat the shit out of him.

1950
02:00:54,370 --> 02:00:56,410
He beat him in a way that
no one's ever beat him,

1951
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:00,190
matched his best and kept going to him
and he beat him in a way that no one's

1952
02:01:00,191 --> 02:01:02,770
ever beat him.
Connor only beat him cause he caught him.

1953
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:07,000
Max Holloway beat him down and beat him.
Beat him down.

1954
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:10,070
Got through the gauntlet.
How big is that tall?

1955
02:01:10,071 --> 02:01:13,840
We can be Hawaii and fighting
his fucking dry aunt.

1956
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,810
I've been singing happy as
Bj Penn and own that island.

1957
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,600
I've been singing that kids
praises for a long time.

1958
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:24,610
He came into the UFC super poor Joseph.
Oh yeah.

1959
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:29,880
The background holding that
devastated like it's his man.

1960
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:36,640
Hey Man. Hey Man. It is what it did.
Did a great job. He's a great fighter.

1961
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:39,920
It is what it is. This is fighting
and people win and people lose.

1962
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:44,750
And the the sport ultimately,
it depends upon the sort of fights.

1963
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:50,080
It depends upon these all time greats
like Aldo facing some guy who's got the

1964
02:01:50,601 --> 02:01:54,590
solution to what that guy presents. Yup.
And that's what although did tonight.

1965
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,041
How do you mean?

1966
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:58,610
He went out there with all
of his championship medal
and he laid it all on the

1967
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:03,520
line. He fought his best and his
puzzle got solved by the new breed.

1968
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:04,790
Let's hear,
let's hear what he has.

1969
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:09,530
Both these guys give us some volume
cause I know how to be a beat.

1970
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:14,240
Him with a torn ACL title wrapped
around it a long time ago still.

1971
02:02:14,241 --> 02:02:15,074
It's incredible.

1972
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:23,940
Diploma. [inaudible] Jesus
Christ. Second of all got,

1973
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:28,900
I got a his son at home. Maybe
Russia. You got another phone baby.

1974
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:35,640
Josh Holloway. Great man. I
love it. George Rush. Saint
Pierre Inspired Nasser. No.

1975
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,320
Nah,
he's Hawaiian.

1976
02:02:39,790 --> 02:02:44,720
You now though. You're on your phone,
don't you man. You guys bike brands.

1977
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:48,990
I love you guys.
[inaudible]

1978
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:53,010
John, powerful shout out to Brazil. Always
a good move. Yeah, but they're boring.

1979
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:55,210
They're pulling them.
Well of course they're booing them.

1980
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,260
They feel like the fight shouldn't have
been stopped because their guy got beat.

1981
02:02:58,261 --> 02:03:01,110
You're smiling that Brazil
started a little slow tonight.

1982
02:03:01,111 --> 02:03:05,850
Then round three when you've got slow,
why you gotta bring up Oh shit.

1983
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:18,410
Sarah,
you had been away.

1984
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:28,510
What? My 50 games. He read
the decision, right? Bang.

1985
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:33,390
I'm a smart QC. Hawaii. Wow. That's
Tom UFC. Hawaii. We'd very tough shit.

1986
02:03:34,270 --> 02:03:35,800
I don't know.
I don't travel overseas,

1987
02:03:35,801 --> 02:03:38,620
but I will fucking fly
to Hawaii in a heartbeat.

1988
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:42,160
I will that make it happen.

1989
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:45,640
How about we do a joint show
up in that mother fucker?

1990
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,720
We miss a

1991
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:52,880
show.
Yeah.

1992
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,820
How about we do a fight companion
in Hawaii if they do a UFC in a,

1993
02:03:57,821 --> 02:04:01,600
why we all fly out to Hawaii and do
some sort of a fight camp painted,

1994
02:04:01,601 --> 02:04:05,080
you know Hawaii. So even if I
don't work in that, we still there.

1995
02:04:05,110 --> 02:04:09,070
Let's be in Hawaii. Yeah. Let's see if
we can get a fight. Companion booth.

1996
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:10,520
Let's just cut the shit.
Okay.

1997
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:16,940
I can do a viking penguin at the show.

1998
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:23,950
This is, this is what I'm thinking. This
is the kind of commentary I liked doing.

1999
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:25,360
So what we need to do,

2000
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:28,450
because you need to treat the
fight companion like an embassy.

2001
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:33,660
Like we have our own special country
rules slash just put us right in their

2002
02:04:34,061 --> 02:04:35,020
life.
Yes.

2003
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:41,640
I want to see bringing Jamie Hall

2004
02:04:43,970 --> 02:04:47,910
and let us do commentary. You don't
have to listen. You got other options.

2005
02:04:47,911 --> 02:04:52,730
You can listen to the Tories. You can
listen to the corner options, right.

2006
02:04:52,731 --> 02:04:56,310
You can tell daddy shops,
you can listen to it in Brazil.

2007
02:04:56,430 --> 02:05:01,350
You can listen to it in Portuguese. Is
that green screen? I think I find sweet.

2008
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,800
Like can you just sit down with Tom
White and have a fucking conversation?

2009
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:07,590
We're going to be better one of
those suites instead of ring side.

2010
02:05:07,591 --> 02:05:10,860
If we did it I see four
season and watch it.

2011
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:15,630
We could totally or we can just keep
doing it for me but we're not getting

2012
02:05:15,631 --> 02:05:19,190
enough playing for [inaudible] here.

2013
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:22,740
Did you imagine if they collapse
of that in fight companion,

2014
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:26,100
if that was one of the options like you
get fight companion or in a fight pass

2015
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:30,560
you get fight companion, you don't
eat. The ratings would go up and fight.

2016
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:35,660
Kiki contacted you that he
decided that it's not a good idea.

2017
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:39,450
Come on man.
Really started long ago.

2018
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:42,180
We have talked about on
the fence head of files.

2019
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,790
We may keep those motherfuckers away.

2020
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:51,570
Is 42,000 people watching
right now that many.

2021
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:57,690
Is that a record? I don't
know, man records. Alex Jones,

2022
02:05:57,691 --> 02:06:00,600
right? Yeah. It was like 60 songs.
Jesus, I forget. People here can watch.

2023
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:03,810
That's a lot of the stadium watching.
How about Derrick Lewis? Mark Hunt.

2024
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:07,020
Look at that fight I got. I should have
done my hair. Bronson, Daniel, Kelly,

2025
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:09,420
Daniel Kelly might just
be able to beat everybody.

2026
02:06:09,690 --> 02:06:11,160
There's something weird about that dude.

2027
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:14,520
He has some weird old man thing going
on. I can shoot dope thing, man.

2028
02:06:14,521 --> 02:06:19,080
The competitor thing. Double knee braces.
Right? It's crazy. These are fucks up.

2029
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:22,230
I asked him about it after the last time
I interviewed him after a fight and he

2030
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:25,290
said if he wasn't fighting he
would get surgery. Fuck he said,

2031
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:28,080
but as long as they let him tape
the fuck out of his niece. Dude,

2032
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:31,200
he's like a mummy. All judo guys. But
like usually judo people I've built,

2033
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:34,380
all their needs are their needs,
their needs get jacked.

2034
02:06:34,590 --> 02:06:38,170
God Damn Max Holloway so long
as punch fast little champ,

2035
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:42,290
man Holloway would that I fucking long
punch. But although countered them not,

2036
02:06:42,291 --> 02:06:44,010
oh look at that woman's amazing.

2037
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,830
Although countered him and
hit him some real big shops.

2038
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
That's how good mass,
you know, it's crazy.

2039
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:55,050
Some people thought maybe cubs swats.
We'll get the next shop up.

2040
02:06:55,051 --> 02:06:58,050
Max fucking annihilated cub.
Yeah. Well, you know what?

2041
02:06:58,051 --> 02:07:01,470
Here's what's important about this fight.
It's not just at Max. Holloway did this,

2042
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:05,100
but that Max Holloway did this
to a Aldo Max Holloway left.

2043
02:07:05,101 --> 02:07:06,690
No doubt in anyone's mind.

2044
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:11,870
This is the best 145 pound
fighter on the planet earth.

2045
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:15,660
If you look at how all though God
pass Frankie Edgar, you look at it,

2046
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:19,000
although God passed everybody except
for Connor, and then you look,

2047
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:21,160
you know the car's not
coming down to one 45 more.

2048
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:24,960
That's the motherfucker right there. And
he made an ecstatic tonight. Holloway.

2049
02:07:24,961 --> 02:07:27,840
Frankie,
you're well,

2050
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:32,100
hey gift you then what in the world,

2051
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:36,040
don't you think that your Yahya Rodriguez
has two forks in the road, right?

2052
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,700
There's the fork of unrealized potential.
So he comes into this fight.

2053
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:44,740
He's got Bj Penn behind him, right? He'll
nylon. It's Bj Penn. He hits Bj Penn,

2054
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:48,610
one of the greatest of all time hall of
Famer with a three 60 round kick to the

2055
02:07:48,611 --> 02:07:50,610
neck.
That just doesn't happen right?

2056
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:55,810
Then he gets murked by frank steroid
and so he has, yes, he's not ready,

2057
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:57,430
but he has two paths.

2058
02:07:57,431 --> 02:08:02,110
Like either he can learn from how Frankie
was able to take him down and beat the

2059
02:08:02,111 --> 02:08:07,111
fuck out of him and then figure out a
way to never let that happen again or be

2060
02:08:07,631 --> 02:08:12,631
overwhelmed by the pressure of that loss
and the circumstances and the sorrow

2061
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,940
depends on his mindset. Also
depends on match. Looks like.

2062
02:08:15,941 --> 02:08:18,130
I like [inaudible] Holloway.
That's a great,

2063
02:08:18,131 --> 02:08:20,510
very good fats hallways and
I can take him down. Sorry.

2064
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:25,100
It just striking for Stryker of both
45 hours. That's a great fight Gavin.

2065
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:29,260
Almost. It'd be damn near even money.
I bet. Yeah, but I guarantee you,

2066
02:08:29,261 --> 02:08:31,090
you're going to see Max
Holloway taking people down to,

2067
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:35,830
I think that dude is smart as fuck,
but he keeps adding to his,

2068
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:37,660
he's not going to take Frankie now.
You're right.

2069
02:08:37,661 --> 02:08:41,100
Their buddies from Kratos listen,
extra foot reach it. But Joel,

2070
02:08:41,101 --> 02:08:44,470
there's really no grapple.
A lot of grapplers left,
right Frankie, you're right.

2071
02:08:44,471 --> 02:08:45,700
Frankie's the big threat.

2072
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:49,270
If you're a guy who can't stop and take
down the number one threat is Frankie

2073
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:53,650
and the white, give him a year.
Why would you give him the one guy

2074
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:59,470
he eating your own young. You're
eating your young. You say that

2075
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:03,790
you believe in protecting fighters.
You get a guy like Jon Jones,

2076
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:08,410
Jon Jones youngest ever does a flying
knee in his opening move against Shogun.

2077
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:11,560
Right? But look what he did. But
that's what makes those guys,

2078
02:09:11,561 --> 02:09:13,840
that's a hard case though
because a couple of good fights.

2079
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:17,980
But that hard case because you don't give
him to a grappler like Frankie knowing

2080
02:09:17,981 --> 02:09:19,860
that the guy cannot stop taking all time,

2081
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:23,080
gave him time to develop and give them
the other guys who are very exciting

2082
02:09:23,081 --> 02:09:27,580
strikers cause he's, he's a star.
John before he won the title,

2083
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:28,910
had some very good fights,

2084
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:31,430
but it's real good fights where
after he got the title four,

2085
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,670
which showed Brandon Vera

2086
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:39,820
cradled Ryan banner that Dante Tez fight
with w w the Stephan Bonner fight was

2087
02:09:39,821 --> 02:09:43,060
one of the most interesting ones
because he showed up creative. It was,

2088
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:46,810
and he shows single-leg spinning
elbow. He showed up creative. He is,

2089
02:09:46,811 --> 02:09:48,370
and he showed up.
Fluid is moving is,

2090
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:52,130
and it just showed that he was on another
level. He never got that. But also, yeah,

2091
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:56,140
you're like, he had a split decision
win over Bruce Leroy. Right.

2092
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:59,650
Very good point. And then they're like,
oh here's Frankie Uyghur. It's like God.

2093
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:00,960
Yeah,

2094
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,350
it's a very good point because I feel
like he felt so good after the Bj Penn

2095
02:10:05,351 --> 02:10:07,660
fight. He felt like he had
arrived and he's like that Alex,

2096
02:10:07,661 --> 02:10:10,390
cause Sarah's fight is out the window.
I'm fucking past that now.

2097
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:15,230
And he might have been, but he wasn't.
There's just this disease levels now.

2098
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:17,090
It is buddy.

2099
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:21,130
Everybody that knows anybody
in any kind of martial art,

2100
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:25,300
whether it's boxing or
wrestling or Jujitsu,

2101
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:29,700
there's always people who overestimate
their proficiency. Pronounce sure.

2102
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:35,690
Get some more. Uh, you quit that
earthy show. This is your fruity.

2103
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:39,380
That's your California. But the boys
nine boys night, we're hanging in Italy.

2104
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:44,040
I'm fucking super impressive.
Max Holloway, man. Super
depressed him say frank,

2105
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:48,170
yet that's coming. There isn't the
only 25. How old is Max Holloway?

2106
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:52,100
Now I want to say he got into the UFC
when he was either 20 or 20 years in

2107
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:56,510
Hawaii, Hawaii together like
fucking peanut butter and Jelly man.

2108
02:10:56,510 --> 02:11:00,200
They fucking love fighting. Cause
Bj, Bj started that man. Dude,

2109
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:03,050
listen champ. Yeah, and a legit champion.

2110
02:11:03,051 --> 02:11:07,220
Just beat who is arguably one of the great
look I gotta say Conners the greatest

2111
02:11:07,221 --> 02:11:10,490
145 pounder of all time because he
knocked out all the WHO's clearly,

2112
02:11:11,490 --> 02:11:16,140
but it terms of like, who's got more
victories? Of course it's all though body,

2113
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:21,620
the body of work. But the, the
problem is, the ultimate question is,

2114
02:11:21,621 --> 02:11:23,240
it's not,
we're not doing MMA math here.

2115
02:11:23,241 --> 02:11:25,070
You having two guys
actually fight each other?

2116
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,020
So if you said like who
the greatest of all time?

2117
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:30,230
Well it would have to be all go because he
beat all these guys. No, no, no, no, no.

2118
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:33,920
Because the two of them fought and Connor
murked up Corinna so you got to give

2119
02:11:33,921 --> 02:11:35,810
it to him.
Otherwise there's no other metric.

2120
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:37,670
There's no other metric
other than a knockout.

2121
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:41,670
What happened was is that it's the most
important body of the sign with the

2122
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:44,420
flathead.
Be penalize for beating someone easily.

2123
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:47,600
I mean like you beat them
to easily say doesn't count.

2124
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:52,790
We had a really good lucky down,
but this is what is in the locker room.

2125
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:55,880
They show him do the exact combo.
Yeah. Like it wasn't like a freak,

2126
02:11:55,881 --> 02:11:58,400
like oh my God,
please show him step back,

2127
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:02,210
throw the exact cup and this is
what's going to happen. Yup. Yeah.

2128
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:06,360
And they also showed him do that front
leg side kick to the leg. It's nice.

2129
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:07,850
He created the distance.

2130
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:11,090
He's hopping in and out and he wanted to
slide back and countered with that left

2131
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:13,700
hand. He hit it perfect. He
called. He's the best ever.

2132
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:16,580
You have to say he's the best ever. Even
if you never fights featherweight again.

2133
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:20,090
Why? Because he kao the
best ever. The real,

2134
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:23,770
the reality is all those the best ever.
But Connor Kod,

2135
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:27,230
you couldn't say without the Aldo
fight that Connor was the best ever.

2136
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:29,810
Cause you look at all the different people
that both of them fall. You're like,

2137
02:12:29,811 --> 02:12:32,360
wow, it's really close. It's
really interesting. But within Wa,

2138
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:35,510
but although I was more fights,
but then once they actually fight,

2139
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:38,620
which is all that, that's all
it matters. All that matters.

2140
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:43,080
Not Mma match your right to competition.
They file it is, I mean that,

2141
02:12:43,081 --> 02:12:45,560
so you got to give it to the light
and people will fight against it. No,

2142
02:12:45,561 --> 02:12:48,290
because all those, the champion for
so many years, you're 100% right.

2143
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:51,440
His body of work as much more impressive
and there's always going to be an

2144
02:12:51,441 --> 02:12:56,270
asterisk next to Connor because you know
there was just this one time he fought

2145
02:12:56,271 --> 02:12:59,450
for the title at one 45 k owed all though.

2146
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:04,800
Y'All be cool.
Y'All be cool here,

2147
02:13:05,890 --> 02:13:10,820
come get it. So it's really
clear. It's really clear.

2148
02:13:10,821 --> 02:13:14,720
There are tied for the best
guy in the shirt. And then
what's the tie breaker? Oh,

2149
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:19,640
their fight. They got what happened in the
fight? You decide, right? You know what?

2150
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,190
You know what's interesting?
It's really simple,

2151
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:24,410
but sometimes like you'll get top ten's,

2152
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:27,650
you'll look at a guy who's number six
and then the guy who was number eight

2153
02:13:27,651 --> 02:13:29,450
knocked him out in the last fight.
And you're like,

2154
02:13:29,451 --> 02:13:32,670
what in the fuck is going body
of work? That's crazy. I know.

2155
02:13:34,250 --> 02:13:35,580
It was an upset.
He got lucky.

2156
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:39,150
Like it says who when it got punches you
in the face and wanted to punch you in

2157
02:13:39,151 --> 02:13:41,970
the face and then punched you in
the face. Where's the luck? We,

2158
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:43,870
what are you doing? He
rolling. I caught him.

2159
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:48,880
But when Tom off hand that fats to be in
the argument of the best ever liked for

2160
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:54,450
all though to be in the argument and
from Mcgregor or for anybody. John Jones,

2161
02:13:54,451 --> 02:13:57,790
like just to be in the goddamn argument.
Oh man,

2162
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:01,680
it's the best ever know what it was in
fade or, or is it, um, Anderson Anderson?

2163
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,590
Who is it? Is it facing? Those are
the two arms. That's the two argument.

2164
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:07,950
I'm always been in the Anderson.
Kim Jones is in there. No, not yet.

2165
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:11,790
I think you still could because his body
of work, he could, but there's so much,

2166
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:15,540
there's so many problems with that. So
many problems with that. Off the field.

2167
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:19,590
Pick the OSP problem. You know, we
were, he had a good fight, I think.

2168
02:14:19,591 --> 02:14:21,960
I think you've performed well.
Gets a really dangerous slick guy,

2169
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:25,980
but he didn't put on a show cave. Then
Anderson Silva has the Damien Maia fight,

2170
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:29,100
the towel size,
those horrible fights,

2171
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:32,580
favorite or had some insights
to Anderson had those earlier.

2172
02:14:32,581 --> 02:14:34,860
And then he started dominating people.

2173
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:38,610
And when you look at some of the crazy
Anderson fights like the Forrest Griffin

2174
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:41,160
Kao, when you look at Anderson
like motivated Anderson,

2175
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:45,150
when he's like in shape and
the James Irvin, when he
went up to two oh five jobs,

2176
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:48,370
I know it's true,
but when you see him as an assassination,

2177
02:14:48,371 --> 02:14:51,390
it's Vitor Belfort Vietor who
named Mark Horton is price.

2178
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:56,580
They talk TRT Victoria go through John
Show Gun. You know what I'm saying?

2179
02:14:57,270 --> 02:15:00,300
That's not true. It wasn't
Trt v tour back then. No.

2180
02:15:00,301 --> 02:15:03,960
Veto wasn't on TRT and became
on TRT factory fight Anderson.

2181
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:06,450
He looked different when he
fought Anderson. He was like,

2182
02:15:06,510 --> 02:15:09,760
he didn't like John [inaudible].

2183
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:15,700
Jack [inaudible] was Vito when he was
19 is that still considered DRTV for no,

2184
02:15:16,311 --> 02:15:20,010
no, no. He said that

2185
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:24,790
he was two 42 40 with
a side of the picture.

2186
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:29,670
Sheriff Jim [inaudible]
and I met his trainer way,

2187
02:15:29,671 --> 02:15:32,780
way back in the day. We used to call
them garden hoses. I remember him,

2188
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:36,540
I remember him
35 years old.

2189
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:39,370
Joe and I were looking at him.
He was thinking he was Joe.

2190
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:41,580
And I remember the airborne memory,
he was eating wars put.

2191
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:44,400
Of course he's eating out of a can of
tuna at the airport and he and I were

2192
02:15:44,401 --> 02:15:46,890
watching her and Joe goes like,
this was looking at a good job. US,

2193
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:50,070
he is the color of aplomb

2194
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:55,110
cause crazy dude.
You never seen anybody that he was,

2195
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:57,730
he was just a totally different,
it's called pressure.

2196
02:15:57,740 --> 02:16:00,030
It's supposed to be was
like in everyone's corner.

2197
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:04,050
Anderson Silva's with a fanny pack and
just call them garden hoses because we

2198
02:16:04,051 --> 02:16:06,980
worked out with him once and a
dude had garden hoses from Hanes.

2199
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:08,320
I think that was his,

2200
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:13,530
nick was his name growing and I think
we might have mentioned it either.

2201
02:16:13,531 --> 02:16:18,210
You and I are but, but it was, but
yeah, he died. Yeah. Yeah Dude.

2202
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:22,200
And this is when too much gear. This is
when Vito was in the Randy couture fight.

2203
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:24,840
So this was the,
those days when Vito looked like a lion,

2204
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:28,980
it looks like a male line. Schuman,
lion, like his neck started.

2205
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,180
Nobody had better training about

2206
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:30,580
here.

2207
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:35,580
I just came straight down and he was
just super jack when he fought Randy.

2208
02:16:36,011 --> 02:16:39,430
He was like two 40 yes, he's
fighting money. Any five now.

2209
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:44,500
Just stop and a tough lady. Five. Just
stop and think of that. That is insane.

2210
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:49,800
I mean that's insane.
Themed out garden hose down.

2211
02:16:50,790 --> 02:16:54,670
No. You remember the other fist fight?
Rockhold is Tiara TV? Do you remember?

2212
02:16:54,671 --> 02:16:58,510
There's another fistfight.
Here's a trivia question for Joe Rogan.

2213
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:02,830
There was a fist fight in the stands
after [inaudible] lost to Randy couture.

2214
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:06,340
Do you remember who it was between?
Um,

2215
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:10,600
was that the one between tank
Abbott? Nope. No. Who Was it? Nope.

2216
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,730
It's how it was always getting.

2217
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:17,920
It was a fist fight between Gemma
fee tourism mom and his girlfriend.

2218
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:23,640
Who's that dude? Dude's that Curtis? Yeah.
Yeah. There he is. That's Mr. Hose. Oh,

2219
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:27,790
is that handles the dude
across the shoulder?

2220
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:31,350
Pull up is a go go big on his
images. Good. Just, just, just,

2221
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:36,070
just does that, but that's him. Just go
big. Make it big. Like close it. Sorry.

2222
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:39,070
Yeah. Look at the size of
his fucking veins, dude.

2223
02:17:39,071 --> 02:17:41,980
We'd be at the gym with them be like,
well, how come we don't look like that?

2224
02:17:42,410 --> 02:17:47,230
Because that doesn't even look like
a human. That dude was so jacked.

2225
02:17:47,231 --> 02:17:50,350
He's super nice guys, biceps,
everything. If he right there,

2226
02:17:50,351 --> 02:17:53,050
right with edit where his elbow is
like, what is that? That's like,

2227
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:56,610
it's a keyboard,
like a steroid that he took some stuff.

2228
02:17:56,680 --> 02:18:00,820
He just fucking biceps right by the side
of the steroids because they always say

2229
02:18:00,821 --> 02:18:02,830
no one's died from steering.
Know your heart.

2230
02:18:03,330 --> 02:18:06,310
It can fuck with your lipid levels and
everything we do. If you do it that much.

2231
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:09,760
God knows what he was taking pictures
on cow blood. He was taking crazy.

2232
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:11,410
People take a lot of crazy stuff.

2233
02:18:11,411 --> 02:18:14,980
They also take insulin and apparently
that's really dangerous in the kitchen.

2234
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:18,390
There's a lot of different stuff that
they tell you. He took a lot of stuff.

2235
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:23,200
All of it is effective if you want
to get to that fucking giant size,

2236
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:25,690
you know? I'm trying to get on
man, I've got to contact him.

2237
02:18:25,691 --> 02:18:29,980
We've been going back and forth. Is Dorian
Yates. Ooh, that'd be fun. Fuck Cam man.

2238
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:34,350
He's going to be, he's going to be
about July giant man. Openly. Yeah.

2239
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:38,560
It tells us dosages do says what he
was doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2240
02:18:38,730 --> 02:18:41,800
Talking about it. Still doing it
now. Well, he does. He's on TRT now.

2241
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:43,320
Talks about that.
Cause we had Phil,

2242
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:46,590
he thought he was Mister Olympia seven
time Mister Olympia. And you go really?

2243
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:50,320
Like you can't like I want to get
steroids. No, we don't humpy come on.

2244
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:54,400
Dorian Yates brings it up himself.
He wants to talk about it. He's like,

2245
02:18:54,430 --> 02:18:57,270
this is crazy. Like everybody should know
what we're doing and there are no nuts.

2246
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:00,490
His credit, Arnold says the same thing,
aren't it? Tells everybody about it too.

2247
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:01,370
Yeah.
They were all there.

2248
02:19:01,371 --> 02:19:04,270
I mean obviously there's no
one way to achieve both sizes.

2249
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:11,130
Yes. Terminators on this too. There's
no way to achieve those sizes.

2250
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:14,100
If you're not taking something.
He's kind of still doing something.

2251
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:21,230
All those pictures of her wants to be
on steroids.

2252
02:19:22,410 --> 02:19:24,710
Oh, you fixed now. He's in shape now to,

2253
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:28,070
Amy's going to have to
terminate her ice off dad. You

2254
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:29,710
guys know he had heart surgery.
Yes.

2255
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:33,290
That's when he looked disgusting on the
beach. That's what was going on. I mean,

2256
02:19:33,291 --> 02:19:36,290
he had a lay lay low.
Let his body were counseling him,

2257
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:40,940
especially alone in the hospital.
If you don't work out,

2258
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:42,790
but he, he's bald. He's bald.

2259
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:51,040
Jack now. God. Holy Shit.
Photoshop maybe. Right.

2260
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:56,480
That can't be real. Now he's getting
help. Is that real dance him? He's jacked.

2261
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:00,440
Oh my God. And Franco Columbo. That's
real shit. He's back. Look at him.

2262
02:20:00,470 --> 02:20:03,600
That's his son right there, right? Well,
you know what he's doing. It's not that

2263
02:20:07,230 --> 02:20:11,450
recent Gold's gym son.
What he's been saying,

2264
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:13,660
what he's been saying is that he's,

2265
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:17,090
he's been working out with Franco
Columbo and him and Franco Columbo travel

2266
02:20:17,091 --> 02:20:19,670
around together and they work out
together. [inaudible] Franco Columbo.

2267
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:23,660
Those dudes were the shit back in the
day and the body and both of them are

2268
02:20:23,661 --> 02:20:27,890
added again. Well, both of
them were on a fucking picture.

2269
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:33,350
Yes. There's a bunch of follow up.
He could personally, he can blow up.

2270
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:35,000
Franco Columbo would do two things.

2271
02:20:35,001 --> 02:20:40,001
One is he could go dip shit that's from
that movie pumping and pumping iron and

2272
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:46,543
shit.

2273
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:52,070
He used to do dips with two girls hanging
off his legs and he can blow up one of

2274
02:20:52,071 --> 02:20:56,070
those old fashion water bladders. You know
those ones you fill up hot water bath.

2275
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:59,000
He can,
he can fill up like to the boys back

2276
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:05,150
hold on. Weekends. Franco Columbia
could make it explode. God Damn,

2277
02:21:05,151 --> 02:21:08,750
he didn't blow it up.
He blew it up and made it pop and Jay z,

2278
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:13,130
he did it in like 30 seconds. That's
how strong saying, just with his power,

2279
02:21:13,131 --> 02:21:14,210
his lung power,

2280
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:17,740
he was one of the most
powerful bodybuilders and he's
one of the smallest. Yes.

2281
02:21:17,750 --> 02:21:20,820
Power. It wasn't a big guy, please.

2282
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:32,810
I was never going to jerk off on
a guy I'm in most of the time.

2283
02:21:33,170 --> 02:21:36,650
I'm not thinking about it.
They go to a gym,

2284
02:21:36,651 --> 02:21:40,120
they're like Lyft and people watch them.
They just go to the gym together, man. Oh,

2285
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:42,140
that's cool. Like if you and
me went to the gym together,

2286
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,120
they go to the gym together.
Go guys.

2287
02:21:44,121 --> 02:21:47,600
Two old guys fucking went at it could
mean Callen went to the gym together.

2288
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:52,890
We're getting old bunny, but frankly we're
on the way to those people. Yes, we are.

2289
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:57,320
Franco's not on any testosterone though.
What are you talking about?

2290
02:21:57,950 --> 02:21:59,750
He's hanging out with Arnold
and he's, he's like, okay,

2291
02:21:59,790 --> 02:22:03,820
well how many milligrams to
bring up Franco right now? Nice.

2292
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,430
Had a question for you. Yeah, hold on.

2293
02:22:06,470 --> 02:22:09,710
We've got two different conversations
going on. I'm sorry. Gun to your head.

2294
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:14,780
Got a gun to your head and you've got
to jerk off on anybody in man's face on

2295
02:22:14,841 --> 02:22:19,580
the planet. Who would it be?
Donald Trump. No, hold on.

2296
02:22:21,090 --> 02:22:25,620
So this is as long as long as

2297
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:29,510
that size.

2298
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,350
So it wouldn't necessarily
be my favorite American, but

2299
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:40,530
I like what? He's not American, but
don't listen to me. Look at me say no.

2300
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,240
Hold on. Absolutely not. Nothing
but respect for Heather Hector love.

2301
02:22:45,550 --> 02:22:47,220
I love Hector Lombard.
I would never,

2302
02:22:47,370 --> 02:22:52,370
he's saying because he don't
even bring a gun to your head.

2303
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:55,890
You don't want to no, no, no, no,
no. I will never, I would never,

2304
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:59,690
I would never splurge on a guy that
I respected as a two level library.

2305
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:05,880
I like Jude law.

2306
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:13,710
I know where you went with
that. Now hold on. Johnny Depp.

2307
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:19,450
[inaudible] mother fuckers got to hold
his hand and they'll get me in the eye

2308
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:27,540
and I have to go like this. I got
to go. Hey listen man. I spent

2309
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:35,790
[inaudible] was the 50s
movie was the 50s movie.

2310
02:23:40,861 --> 02:23:44,210
What was it? Cold outside. It just got
to go back to him and the outsiders.

2311
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:47,930
I'm 50 21 jump street,
you know,

2312
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:52,950
tried to hate your but this
moment because I'm 50 is it

2313
02:23:54,770 --> 02:23:56,190
not shooting heavy?

2314
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,450
She got a baby bird.

2315
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,170
If you came on his face and he caught
those teeth, you'd feel bad. Right?

2316
02:24:08,190 --> 02:24:11,680
The snuggle t look at
if you saw your own cup

2317
02:24:14,210 --> 02:24:17,550
first just to look like Photoshop. Know
Brian. He used to have terrible teeth,

2318
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:19,740
dammit.
Oh my God.

2319
02:24:22,990 --> 02:24:26,310
I think they actually added a shark tooth.
Well that's him after braces.

2320
02:24:26,311 --> 02:24:29,670
He had braces when he was like
40 that'd be braces in veneers.

2321
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:33,990
Yellow teeth were also off to one side.

2322
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:38,700
I want to know how he got, I want to know
the story of how he got in. Is there a,

2323
02:24:38,701 --> 02:24:40,830
is there a video out there?
Scientology.

2324
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:45,510
How did he get in? Like what
happened? That's a good question.

2325
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:48,060
I think somebody recruited them
from a movie. He was good though.

2326
02:24:48,061 --> 02:24:49,830
He was already at movies.
He was

2327
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:56,040
the guy who made that happen

2328
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:03,040
on Scientology.
There's like season for

2329
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:08,130
my podcast. She talked about it
and you know, when I first met her,

2330
02:25:08,131 --> 02:25:10,680
she was deep in it.
She was with Kevin James,

2331
02:25:10,681 --> 02:25:13,640
she was on king and Queens and that's
when I first met her and he was like,

2332
02:25:13,650 --> 02:25:18,170
she's a scientologist, was like, Woo.
She's really nice. She's very cool man.

2333
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:22,440
That's just QT to mind. Control
keys. That's all that is. Well,

2334
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:24,030
somebody figured out how to control people

2335
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:24,873
long time ago.

2336
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:28,870
It's called come up with a set of rules
and say that this is like someone's

2337
02:25:28,871 --> 02:25:29,920
looking out for this set of rules,

2338
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:34,460
whether it's God or Buddha
or creating mythology.

2339
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:38,530
Do is do that and people follow it.
It's the stuff that,

2340
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:42,860
until they know nothing but reports of,
uh,

2341
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:48,390
child abuse, it just gives a
lot cheaper using colts. Yeah.

2342
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:51,130
It's one of the big problems with cults.
Joey Diaz,

2343
02:25:51,131 --> 02:25:54,970
his ex girlfriends was in a cult like
when she was a kid and he, she said that,

2344
02:25:54,971 --> 02:25:57,650
uh, the guy who was the head of the
call molested everybody. Of course.

2345
02:25:57,790 --> 02:26:01,090
Less it all the girls. Yeah. Molested.
He wanted to fuck everybody's one. Yeah.

2346
02:26:01,091 --> 02:26:05,620
It's all just, that's cool.
Yeah. That's all these calls.

2347
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,930
That's what happened. Polygamy.
Waco, crazy. David Koresh.
That's the crazy thing.

2348
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:12,760
David Koresh. They shut that
motherfucker shit. The down.

2349
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:16,600
We are allowing this to happen.
It's like we want it to happen.

2350
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:19,430
It's like it's a CIA.
Mk Ultra Express.

2351
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:25,230
Well, what do you mean? Well,

2352
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:29,900
I realize,
look at the time,

2353
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:40,400
let me feed the beast riders on the
storm. I don't know shit. I don't know

2354
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:47,020
how, and when you look into it, you
got to look in the, look into it.

2355
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:49,400
I've been living into it.
Think about this.

2356
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:53,300
Think about how crazy that religion
is. Yeah. Think about that.

2357
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:57,510
Think about how it's allowed
to survive and thrive.

2358
02:26:57,511 --> 02:27:00,200
You seemed like Scientology even better.
I'll do you one better.

2359
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:02,030
Scientology doesn't have to pay taxes.

2360
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:07,730
Hold on. I'll tell you, I'll
tell you the kitchen, the facts,

2361
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:09,200
I'm not taking the actual fact.

2362
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:14,360
They organized a massive lawsuit
campaign against the IRS.

2363
02:27:14,570 --> 02:27:17,630
And they said that if you can say
that all these different religions,

2364
02:27:17,631 --> 02:27:20,060
whether it's Catholicism or Mormonism,

2365
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:22,820
Mormonism has very
questionable backgrounds.

2366
02:27:22,821 --> 02:27:25,670
More minutes was started by Joseph
Smith who was a known con man.

2367
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:28,010
I mean Mormonism course.
It's, yeah, there's,

2368
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:32,540
there's like he found it when he was
14 he said he found golden tablets that

2369
02:27:32,541 --> 02:27:36,260
contained the loss work of Jesus and only
he could read him cause he had a magic

2370
02:27:36,261 --> 02:27:38,270
seer stone.
Like when you look at the actual,

2371
02:27:38,271 --> 02:27:42,590
you're talking about a guy who we know
the guy, right? So Scientology was like,

2372
02:27:42,591 --> 02:27:45,740
well so fucking what if you can take that?
If you'd take Mormonism,

2373
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:49,130
like why can't we get tax exempt
status? And they said, no, fuck you.

2374
02:27:49,131 --> 02:27:51,950
You're not a real religion. And
they're like bullshit. If, if,

2375
02:27:52,190 --> 02:27:55,640
if anything is a religion where religion
and in that sense I support them.

2376
02:27:55,700 --> 02:27:58,310
I don't think, I think all
religions should have to pay taxes.

2377
02:27:58,460 --> 02:28:00,590
But I think that if
anybody gets a free ride,

2378
02:28:00,710 --> 02:28:02,090
so I told you you should get a free ride.

2379
02:28:02,290 --> 02:28:05,190
If you're going to have this
goofy loophole, then they qualify.

2380
02:28:07,770 --> 02:28:12,020
If Mormons get up to, that's what happened
at he is massive lawsuits. It was the,

2381
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:15,530
and this is all you could find it.
I saw it, I saw the ideal document.

2382
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:19,810
They filed a Shitload of lawsuits and
the IRS was fuck you talking about going

2383
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:22,400
clear the gaskets, amazing books, amazing

2384
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,470
doc. It's a great, the books even better.

2385
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:26,930
Great because it goes into
the history of this big book.

2386
02:28:28,230 --> 02:28:29,510
Everything's allowed to happen.

2387
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:31,480
The thing is no one can pay
attention to everything.

2388
02:28:31,510 --> 02:28:34,340
Everything is allowed to happen all
the time and then once we find out that

2389
02:28:34,341 --> 02:28:36,380
something's happening and
it's like, okay, now what?

2390
02:28:38,330 --> 02:28:39,650
You can't shut down a religion?
Well,

2391
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:43,910
you can't shut down anybody's freedom
of speech. If you have an ideology,

2392
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:46,850
your freedom of expression,
your your ability to gather and talk,

2393
02:28:48,590 --> 02:28:52,670
no shit. All I know is if,
if I had a country to run,

2394
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,400
I would start.
If I was running in the country,

2395
02:28:55,401 --> 02:28:58,790
I would start colts and have mind
control experiments with too,

2396
02:28:58,791 --> 02:29:02,360
but I wouldn't have time in between
negotiating oil deals and trying to figure

2397
02:29:02,361 --> 02:29:07,361
out whether or not we should stay then
NATO and prime it Paris climate control.

2398
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:12,680
I know what you're saying and
you know in a way you're right,

2399
02:29:12,681 --> 02:29:16,730
but no one has the time to do ever is
not enough to micro manage the entire

2400
02:29:16,731 --> 02:29:20,140
world business. Right. It's just there's,

2401
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:23,810
there's only so much shit you
can let people take care of them.

2402
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:29,800
You could let people take care of
themselves. Illuminati got key,

2403
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:38,030
got enough time for mind
control experiments.

2404
02:29:38,270 --> 02:29:39,980
There's too much shit going on.
Well,

2405
02:29:39,981 --> 02:29:43,160
they definitely have done some
mind control experiments too.

2406
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:46,270
That's part of the problem around
the country. I'm thinking of.

2407
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:53,740
I'm saying Goodbye Comic Book Guy
Writes Comic Books. I would definitely

2408
02:29:56,060 --> 02:30:00,830
read who you're going to start a religion.
You're going to start a religion.

2409
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,490
You're going to start and just,

2410
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:06,890
you're going to bullshit in this way
and we're going to who? Who is right.

2411
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:10,370
I want to know from you and you better
tell me my country at least 500 years old.

2412
02:30:10,371 --> 02:30:14,150
The candy. Oh it's, you know
it. You have a question,
Brian, you got to tell me this,

2413
02:30:14,151 --> 02:30:17,140
cause I know you know the fucking answer,
but as a dictator hold other.

2414
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:20,340
I want you to ask
your finger on the post.

2415
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:25,490
I want to know right now on this
podcast who was running this country.

2416
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:28,220
I have no idea. Come on Bro. I don't know.

2417
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:31,520
Give me a little idea cause I know
you got to fucking, I don't know Bro.

2418
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:34,310
You're out. You're playing dumb
right now. I'm going to guess,

2419
02:30:34,370 --> 02:30:38,840
I'm going to guess based
on circumstantial evidence.

2420
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:42,450
I'm going to Oprah. The guests, uh,

2421
02:30:43,690 --> 02:30:46,220
educating guys, control the banks. That's,

2422
02:30:46,221 --> 02:30:50,770
I don't know who would they
be Roth trials. I Dunno. I
could be wrong with that.

2423
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:54,560
Slippy Rothschild's could be a complete
none of the application. That's an,

2424
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:58,100
I don't know. I looked up on the day
in the Rothschilds like a family.

2425
02:30:58,130 --> 02:31:02,600
Here's what's hilarious.
It's 1 billion to like 70 trillion,

2426
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:04,190
700 trillion,

2427
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:08,470
700 billion or trillion
number lays it there.

2428
02:31:08,471 --> 02:31:12,530
The amount of money they own.
It's either one a billion. Oh,

2429
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:16,130
a hundred percent surreal.
Oh, 100% there's a family
that owns all the banks. No.

2430
02:31:16,131 --> 02:31:19,170
There is a family that has a
considerable amount of money.

2431
02:31:19,171 --> 02:31:23,390
They pass down from generation generation
and these, these young, the Saturations,

2432
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:27,430
how much figured out how
to connect in the real.

2433
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:30,960
We don't use it. We don't
know. That's what they say.

2434
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:35,270
They say between 1,000,000,700
zillion. Nope. Says 500 trucks.

2435
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:40,200
But do they even exist to the rob trials
even exists? That could be a conspiracy.

2436
02:31:40,201 --> 02:31:43,030
Can I say one thing? The
Rothschilds are a hoax. Okay.

2437
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:45,360
Think about the Rock Charles.
When, when you talk about the Ross,

2438
02:31:45,361 --> 02:31:48,420
Charles and these different big families,
if there's one thing in common,

2439
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:52,140
it's a hoax. Nope, follow me on this if
you hear it. Nope. They're all Jewish.

2440
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:55,070
And by the way, if you look at their
roots, if you look at the roots of these,

2441
02:31:55,071 --> 02:31:57,660
a lot of these, a lot of these rumors,
a lot of these rumors and conspiracies,

2442
02:31:57,661 --> 02:32:02,250
they start in the the free mail,
not to cams.

2443
02:32:02,251 --> 02:32:06,270
And the ultra right wing camps
and a lot of the antisemetic anti,

2444
02:32:06,271 --> 02:32:10,570
you know the history that goes way back,

2445
02:32:10,590 --> 02:32:13,530
that goes way back into Europe.
That goes way back with the Nazi.

2446
02:32:13,531 --> 02:32:15,840
So just be careful where
these things come from.

2447
02:32:15,841 --> 02:32:20,050
You'll find that there are roots. No, I
know. I don't know shit. I'm on Youtube.

2448
02:32:20,180 --> 02:32:23,000
Yeah, their roots sometimes
starting really at off places.

2449
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:26,160
So you should read a
book every now and then.

2450
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:32,370
The guy who's had clear and the looming
tower, two very good books. I Dunno.

2451
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:35,370
The plant paradox, which I'm reading
now about food, very interesting.

2452
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:41,030
Benefits me to believe something unless
I make money from it. Yeah. Idiot.

2453
02:32:41,490 --> 02:32:45,120
You're a fucking idiot. You know,
like what is, if I believe this dude,

2454
02:32:45,121 --> 02:32:45,870
you could be fucking,

2455
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:48,840
your kids could be go to college
if you want measurable results.

2456
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:52,700
If you just sign off and
say you believe it, like uh,

2457
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:57,120
that's not what's going to happen.
Is it illegal? If I don't believe it,

2458
02:32:57,970 --> 02:33:01,380
well I get thrown in jail.
No, then I don't want to.

2459
02:33:01,381 --> 02:33:03,940
If I don't want to believe Shit,
if it,

2460
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:08,430
if it doesn't hurt me I it
shouldn't be such a big deal.

2461
02:33:08,670 --> 02:33:11,520
That's you know, that's, I
don't know what to believe man.

2462
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:15,120
I don't know if the Rothschilds are real.
I Dunno if reptilians are real.

2463
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:19,740
I don't know. Satanism is real. I don't
know. Shit. One thing I'd say is learning,

2464
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:24,830
getting closer to the truth can be
achieved by looking at all the independent

2465
02:33:24,901 --> 02:33:25,890
lines of inquiry.

2466
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:30,640
All the independent lines come to one
consensus to come to the truth is that

2467
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:32,750
you're trying to tell me
exactly how to come up.

2468
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:35,720
I'm just saying generally I'm spelling
in general cause I would never tell you

2469
02:33:35,730 --> 02:33:39,270
to get closer. Come on. Come on
man. I'm talking about Janet.

2470
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:41,250
Let me say this cause I think
this is really important.

2471
02:33:41,251 --> 02:33:45,960
One of the problems that I've had me
personally I've had with any idea is that

2472
02:33:45,961 --> 02:33:49,860
once I have an original idea, a, once I
start looking at something a certain way,

2473
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:52,440
I become married to it. Yes. And
I bet real problems with that.

2474
02:33:52,441 --> 02:33:54,690
And the problem is half. It's
confirmation bias. I understand.

2475
02:33:54,691 --> 02:33:56,430
But I'm just saying I've
had real problems with that.

2476
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:59,310
Like personally where I had to look
at like what I believed and go,

2477
02:33:59,311 --> 02:34:01,770
well why do I believe that and why?
Why do I think,

2478
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:05,280
and there's been a bunch of times
whether it's your big foot or Ufos or,

2479
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:09,510
I mean I've looked at the
JFK assassination a hundred
different fucking times.

2480
02:34:09,511 --> 02:34:12,150
You know, there's been times when I
said, well maybe Oswald got lucky me.

2481
02:34:12,151 --> 02:34:14,190
Like people do get lucky.
Like I,

2482
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:18,190
I've shot the first animal I ever shot.
I shot at 200

2483
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:22,630
yards and I probably shouldn't have had
it dropped. I could have fucked that up.

2484
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:25,240
You know, you can, if
you're aiming at something,

2485
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:27,910
pull the trigger and hit the president
in the back of the head. It is possible.

2486
02:34:28,060 --> 02:34:31,750
I don't think it did. It seems to me
more like some other shit was going on.

2487
02:34:31,751 --> 02:34:33,400
If you look at all the
different pieces of evidence,

2488
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:37,690
but I don't fucking know man.
And the problem with saying this happened,

2489
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:41,920
that happened, which I used to do all
the time, is that you don't fucking know.

2490
02:34:42,010 --> 02:34:46,750
You don't know. You don't know until
you do know when you say you know,

2491
02:34:46,751 --> 02:34:51,120
and you might be wrong, it becomes an
ego thing. So you can speculate. Yes,

2492
02:34:51,250 --> 02:34:54,280
you can get closer to the truth. She would
approximate. So if you hear scientists,

2493
02:34:54,281 --> 02:34:56,080
they always say it's so fascinating.

2494
02:34:56,081 --> 02:34:59,920
Scientist start always with doubt and
what they do is they always say if you

2495
02:34:59,921 --> 02:35:04,000
really corner signs that say,
well this is the most likely, uh,

2496
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:07,030
based on the data I've looked at are
the literature I've read carefully.

2497
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:10,150
This is the most likely possibility.

2498
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:13,300
It's really interesting to hear how they
talk that way because like with global

2499
02:35:13,301 --> 02:35:17,530
warming or anything, if you're not Kraus,
uh, yes, it's across the house. Listen,

2500
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:18,880
I've had him on my podcast.

2501
02:35:18,881 --> 02:35:22,630
I listened to both the podcasts you had
with them and try to read some of his

2502
02:35:22,631 --> 02:35:25,210
book. It was tough. But yes,
I love book is rough dude.

2503
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:27,790
When he started to have to
have a back age symmetry,

2504
02:35:27,791 --> 02:35:31,150
when he was going to gauge symmetry and
I fucked up by opening up my podcast,

2505
02:35:31,151 --> 02:35:35,080
asking him to explain gauge symmetry.
Now I know it's insane.

2506
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:39,670
I got, this is what I got some hole in
your head. I got the, there's a web,

2507
02:35:39,671 --> 02:35:43,720
there's an invisible web and we come
into contact with w w we, we become mass,

2508
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:46,330
but we have to understand is
skepticals we are of this shit.

2509
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:49,780
These are the same motherfuckers they
put together the large Hadron Collider,

2510
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:54,130
Sierra spinning Adams just slightly
under the speed of light slamming,

2511
02:35:54,131 --> 02:35:58,720
admitted to each other and recreating
the very instances right after the big

2512
02:35:58,721 --> 02:36:02,060
bang and they're doing that shit
right. Crazy. There's a team of sign.

2513
02:36:02,061 --> 02:36:06,340
How many sides does 130 countries?
Thousands. Thousands. Guys, find out.

2514
02:36:06,341 --> 02:36:10,820
How many of you guys all agree that
Nikola Tesla was a great scientist? Oh,

2515
02:36:10,821 --> 02:36:12,370
he's a genius.
He was a genius,

2516
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:17,050
but you got to remember the Nikola Tesla
lived in a world where he was so far

2517
02:36:17,051 --> 02:36:20,410
ahead of the curve and there's very few
people that were able to compete with

2518
02:36:20,411 --> 02:36:21,840
them or even understand what he was doing.

2519
02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:27,210
Do you know that if you go to youtube and
you punch in Nikola Tesla hopes fraud,

2520
02:36:27,550 --> 02:36:31,610
nothing comes up. That's
amazing. That makes sense. Yeah.

2521
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:34,820
And that's also a guy lives
1920 on the planet dispute.

2522
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:38,320
Trying to say all that shit was bullshit.
There's no,

2523
02:36:38,410 --> 02:36:42,820
you go to youtube punching
Nikola Tesla hoax fraud.

2524
02:36:43,030 --> 02:36:47,800
Not One fucking video.
There's videos that come up that saying,

2525
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:52,660
uh, something else was a
hoax. Nikola Tesla approves
it. Or you know, Nixon Nixon,

2526
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:54,010
Tesla proves hoax,

2527
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:59,190
but not one video of anybody
ever say Nikola Tesla.

2528
02:36:59,310 --> 02:37:01,210
I feel like,
but yeah,

2529
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:05,140
but this is just the fact that
you can take it or leave it.

2530
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:09,190
Put in Albert Einstein hoax fraud.

2531
02:37:10,180 --> 02:37:14,930
Endless videos. It's a bummer. It
was a free, yeah, it does videos.

2532
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:15,980
They're like,
wait

2533
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:18,830
a minute,
it's an Albert was an Albert Einstein.

2534
02:37:19,100 --> 02:37:23,700
Time magazine's man of the century.
Let me stop.

2535
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:26,460
I thought he was the smartest man in
a second. Let me just help you here.

2536
02:37:26,790 --> 02:37:29,310
You're getting very dramatic. So let
me stop for a second. If you put,

2537
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:34,010
if you put in Holocaust hoax,
you'll get an equal number of them.

2538
02:37:34,050 --> 02:37:38,270
I'm not talking about that. You
know, if you put in Sandy Hook hoax,

2539
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:39,710
you're getting an equal number.
You get it.

2540
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:42,150
You get a tremendous number
of people that think that

2541
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:46,160
it's amazing.
Well all sign on him.

2542
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:51,530
How about people that don't think
that Richard Pryor was genius prior?

2543
02:37:51,531 --> 02:37:52,790
Have you ever met a comic wants?

2544
02:37:52,791 --> 02:37:54,830
It doesn't think Richard Pryor is
one of the greatest of all time.

2545
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:58,640
They don't exist to videos of people
trying to prove that he was wasn't the

2546
02:37:58,641 --> 02:38:03,380
greatest sound, but I mean, look, I
believe that snow melting on Nikola Tesla,

2547
02:38:03,410 --> 02:38:07,660
I don't think that Einstein was
a hoax dude. Causation though.

2548
02:38:07,770 --> 02:38:09,980
Shit, I'm not, I don't know nothing.

2549
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:14,530
All I know is there's nothing on
Nikola Tesla doesn't mean anything,

2550
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:19,540
but there's thousands of Albert
I you look into his life like,

2551
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:24,680
Oh, anyone besides business
Tesla. Oh, does it have that?

2552
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:27,620
Is he the only guy at Thomas Edison?

2553
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:32,210
Thomas Edison was always
accused of stealing the ideas
of Nikola Tesla. In fact,

2554
02:38:32,211 --> 02:38:36,110
Thomas Edison electrocuted an elephant
in the middle of like, what was it,

2555
02:38:36,111 --> 02:38:38,930
the World Thomas. Oh, Thomas Edison.

2556
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:42,980
Thomas Edison electrocuted
a fucking elephants.

2557
02:38:42,981 --> 02:38:46,760
There's video because he wanted to prove
that alternating and direct current

2558
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:51,270
ACDC, which is Tesla's idea. There's
video of analysis for an electric heater,

2559
02:38:51,271 --> 02:38:55,130
not by Thomas [inaudible].
Thomas Edison did it.

2560
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:58,010
The reason why he did it is to
prove what you tried to like.

2561
02:38:58,040 --> 02:39:00,440
It was propaganda against Tesla's ideas,

2562
02:39:00,441 --> 02:39:04,670
which are more advanced form
of movable like he wanted,

2563
02:39:04,671 --> 02:39:08,900
he wanted there to be alternating
currents and test test lesson was a direct

2564
02:39:08,901 --> 02:39:13,850
Einstein's. We're alive and
kicking at the same time. Tesla,

2565
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:16,130
there's quotes.
The quotes could be bullshit.

2566
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:18,360
You know Tesla comes from several dead.

2567
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:24,770
He thought Einstein was a fraud.
That could be a phrase that I've heard.

2568
02:39:24,771 --> 02:39:29,560
I've heard that shit. But there are quotes
that can be bullshit of Tesla. There's,

2569
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:34,340
I keep, they keep popping up breaking even
on it. Hold on, hold on. There's quotes.

2570
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:39,600
Test the quotes saying the theory
of relativity is basically a joke.

2571
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:43,970
There's tests. Haha. No, no. What
I'm saying is it could be bullshit,

2572
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:45,730
but it keeps coming up when they're no,

2573
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:48,410
we know that the theory of
relativity is used right.

2574
02:39:48,411 --> 02:39:50,510
So that we know that that's
not so much a theory anymore.

2575
02:39:50,511 --> 02:39:53,600
But here's what I think that
he's addressing. So Einstein,

2576
02:39:53,601 --> 02:39:56,780
from what I have read is
Einstein was a great mind,

2577
02:39:56,810 --> 02:40:01,670
but he was coming up at a time where
he got most of the credit he got.

2578
02:40:01,671 --> 02:40:02,504
He became very,

2579
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:06,950
he became a famous scientist when there
were a lot of scientists working on very

2580
02:40:06,951 --> 02:40:08,510
similar, right? He was an average side.

2581
02:40:08,570 --> 02:40:13,560
So getting blown up and contributing
to the larger debate about, uh, um,

2582
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:14,593
uh,

2583
02:40:15,050 --> 02:40:18,000
um, what does it need? Uh,
quantum physics, right.

2584
02:40:18,010 --> 02:40:20,910
And so there was also a big
debate about their methods,

2585
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:24,450
whereas Tesla was a
big fan of experiments.

2586
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:28,880
Einstein was a big fan of equations and
one of the big, quite a big criticisms,

2587
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:31,710
one of the big quotes and say,
what are you pulling up today?

2588
02:40:32,220 --> 02:40:36,140
What does this Tesla's overrated
debunking Tesla, Tesla's a pop,

2589
02:40:36,190 --> 02:40:40,500
a figure and conspiracy culture. What
is, what is it saying? What is he saying?

2590
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:44,340
He says, test. That's not even just
a conspiracy. What is he saying?

2591
02:40:45,890 --> 02:40:48,690
He sat right here. He says,
Tessa was a popular figure today,

2592
02:40:48,691 --> 02:40:51,510
but he's also a self publicist
and this stuff he didn't invent.

2593
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:54,100
He did not event alternate and current.
Yeah,

2594
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,760
he just was one of many people
working on it. Okay. What?

2595
02:40:56,761 --> 02:41:00,300
He's probably one of the four forefront.
Mine's right.

2596
02:41:00,510 --> 02:41:03,930
Being a showman helped popularize it too.
She's so good at that.

2597
02:41:03,931 --> 02:41:04,651
Eventually had to,

2598
02:41:04,651 --> 02:41:09,651
I don't know if he's right or not promise
and he said there was no one saying

2599
02:41:09,781 --> 02:41:13,890
anything against it,
but there is free energy and he's,

2600
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:16,170
he's he 100% official story.

2601
02:41:16,171 --> 02:41:19,770
He's not against not w he doesn't
believe in that one conspiracy. You know,

2602
02:41:19,771 --> 02:41:21,480
you're right.
100% and that's one of my,

2603
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:23,340
the only criticism that
had about that guy.

2604
02:41:23,550 --> 02:41:25,420
Like when we talked
about the Gulf of Tonkin,

2605
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:28,020
he doesn't want to even admit
that Gulf was false flag

2606
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:32,550
operation Northwoods. He was trying
to downplay, I'm like, look man,

2607
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:35,370
whether or not you know what happened
in any other place, like you know,

2608
02:41:35,371 --> 02:41:40,371
the Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote down a
memo saying what the plan was to have

2609
02:41:40,980 --> 02:41:44,490
Guantanamo Bay attack by Cuban friendlies
that we're going to give them guns,

2610
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:48,420
give them bombs, have them attack American
civilians. He's always like, well,

2611
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:52,080
it never was implemented.
I was like, it's, it's, it
doesn't matter. They signed it.

2612
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:54,120
Kennedy had a veto. Yes,
but Kennedy vetoed it.

2613
02:41:54,121 --> 02:41:56,370
That's why there's checks and
balances and in place like no, no, no.

2614
02:41:56,520 --> 02:42:01,520
The mindset behind the type of person
that would want to blow up Americans and

2615
02:42:01,861 --> 02:42:05,680
blame it on the Cuban so we could
justify the founding families.

2616
02:42:05,790 --> 02:42:09,030
There would always be people within the
government that would do anything they

2617
02:42:09,031 --> 02:42:11,550
could. And so that's where the
checks and balances of course,

2618
02:42:11,551 --> 02:42:15,350
they don't always go through
perfectly. That's, I mean if, if PR,

2619
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:18,600
if Nixon was Reagan or,

2620
02:42:18,601 --> 02:42:22,500
I mean if it was rather if a Kennedy
rather was Reagan or Kennedy was Nixon,

2621
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:25,650
he might very well have let that slide.
Who knows?

2622
02:42:25,770 --> 02:42:29,010
I mean a different person in a different
circumstance with a different view of

2623
02:42:29,011 --> 02:42:32,640
the world could have let the joint
chiefs of staff pull that through.

2624
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:34,440
So that shows you the mindset,
right?

2625
02:42:34,490 --> 02:42:38,850
So the mindsets undeniable that people
absolutely do conspire. So when you,

2626
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:41,190
a guy who never believed in conspiracies,

2627
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:44,670
you do just as much damage
as a guy who always believed.

2628
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:49,320
Alexander Hamilton said that it's not
just a king you have to worry about,

2629
02:42:49,710 --> 02:42:53,550
it's your actual government that's
been elected. So just because you,

2630
02:42:53,570 --> 02:42:56,010
your parliament,
he was using promise as an example.

2631
02:42:56,310 --> 02:42:57,570
Just cause problem was voted in,

2632
02:42:57,571 --> 02:43:01,410
doesn't mean that small group of people
will not get power hungry and trunk.

2633
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:04,530
So therefore you've got to have
all these checks and balances.

2634
02:43:04,531 --> 02:43:05,370
You've got to have courts,

2635
02:43:05,371 --> 02:43:08,580
you've got all kinds of things and you
have to have a Senate and a house of

2636
02:43:08,581 --> 02:43:10,380
Representatives.
This is where these ideas came from.

2637
02:43:10,381 --> 02:43:11,980
That's what the of those fucking

2638
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:14,630
guys, well it's the only thing right
now is keeping Trump from instituting.

2639
02:43:14,631 --> 02:43:17,420
He has traveled,
man do it a lot of [inaudible] still.

2640
02:43:17,470 --> 02:43:18,850
But even with those checks and balances,

2641
02:43:18,851 --> 02:43:22,360
he's still able to cut back
the EPA budgets. Democracy.

2642
02:43:22,361 --> 02:43:24,130
It was from the Paris climate agreement.

2643
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:27,670
So there's a lot of weird shit that
goes on that they didn't anticipate us,

2644
02:43:27,730 --> 02:43:29,410
but what they didn't anticipate,

2645
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:33,310
they did put enough checks and balances
that it's keeping from one person,

2646
02:43:33,311 --> 02:43:37,010
from just completely dominating the thing.
Because they came from monarchies.

2647
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:38,620
Those guys,
they came from monarchies.

2648
02:43:38,621 --> 02:43:41,530
They knew that no matter who
you are as a human being,

2649
02:43:41,890 --> 02:43:44,020
whether you're democratically
elected or you're,

2650
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:46,690
you're divinely elected like
the king wasn't in Europe,

2651
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:49,150
you are going to take
advantage of your power.

2652
02:43:49,151 --> 02:43:50,230
You're going to get drunk with power.

2653
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:54,460
It's very human and to want to have
control over other people and do for them

2654
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:57,930
what what they don't know is best
for themselves. That's oral man.

2655
02:43:57,931 --> 02:44:01,690
Look at whether it's Libya or look at
North Korea or looking at people want to

2656
02:44:01,691 --> 02:44:03,340
dominate the people around them.

2657
02:44:03,341 --> 02:44:05,380
They've been doing it since
the beginning of time.

2658
02:44:05,381 --> 02:44:07,990
If you don't think they're doing it
right now, you're fucking crazy, right?

2659
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:12,580
The question is what is the absolute
objective thing that's happening here?

2660
02:44:12,650 --> 02:44:14,860
Like the objective view
of what's happening here.

2661
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:17,350
That's where it gets real
tricky for all of us.

2662
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:19,660
Whenever we say we know
that something's happening,

2663
02:44:20,380 --> 02:44:23,380
there's no way you could know and I
know that there's no way you can know,

2664
02:44:23,381 --> 02:44:26,680
so now we have a really
tainted conversation because
we're not looking at this

2665
02:44:26,681 --> 02:44:30,040
whole thing. Honestly, whether it,
whether whatever the fuck it is,

2666
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:32,920
whether it's aliens or life
after death or anything,

2667
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:37,060
I need to absolutely fucking know
that you're being honest. Yeah,

2668
02:44:37,090 --> 02:44:40,660
and as soon as I don't think you are or
if I think you're trying to gain power,

2669
02:44:40,820 --> 02:44:44,950
if as soon as you see a politician give
some bullshit fucking speech where you

2670
02:44:44,951 --> 02:44:48,640
know that they're giving this cane,
this canned cadence,

2671
02:44:48,850 --> 02:44:51,620
this nonsense rhetoric,
and you knew as soon as they get into,

2672
02:44:51,650 --> 02:44:55,270
they're going to give into the fucking
special interest groups. That's right.

2673
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:57,940
That's what Bush, it happens with
everybody. It happened with Obama.

2674
02:44:57,970 --> 02:44:59,410
That's why a free press,

2675
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:02,800
that's why a free press from all
different angles is so important.

2676
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:06,430
Uncensored press and that's why it's
called the fourth estate man that keeps

2677
02:45:06,431 --> 02:45:10,210
puking power in check. Transparency
does, and that's the other thing.

2678
02:45:10,211 --> 02:45:12,580
The other problem is that
when government grows,

2679
02:45:12,581 --> 02:45:14,920
which it always has a tendency
to do what does government do?

2680
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:19,750
It taxes and passes laws to very coercive
measures. You keep growing government.

2681
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:22,960
Here's what happens. It doesn't get more
powerful nest. It gets more powerful,

2682
02:45:22,961 --> 02:45:26,260
but also more people are dependent on it.

2683
02:45:26,470 --> 02:45:30,370
More people are feeding from the public
trough and then it becomes really hard

2684
02:45:30,371 --> 02:45:31,120
to get rid of it.

2685
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:34,780
It's really hard to get rid of a
government program once it starts because

2686
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,090
they're a cottage industry
grows up around it.

2687
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:40,130
To me that's the big problem they
have right now with prisons. Yes.

2688
02:45:40,270 --> 02:45:41,710
There's so many fucking prisons.

2689
02:45:41,711 --> 02:45:45,490
And then they start prison
guard unions start passing laws.

2690
02:45:45,491 --> 02:45:49,300
They started lobbying to get laws
passed to keep marijuana illegal,

2691
02:45:49,301 --> 02:45:50,134
to make sure that their,

2692
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:54,340
their prisons are filled because these
prisons become generators of money.

2693
02:45:54,370 --> 02:45:58,630
That's right. They don't become places
where PiCompany economies in slaved. Dude,

2694
02:45:58,631 --> 02:45:59,030
it's so,

2695
02:45:59,030 --> 02:46:03,730
so your politicians not going to say
anything that's going to get not grow that

2696
02:46:03,731 --> 02:46:06,490
industry. That's too much
pressure. As a politician,

2697
02:46:06,491 --> 02:46:10,130
you spend 40% of your time
raising money from strangers

2698
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:14,360
for your next election. What about
that conspiracy theory about uh,

2699
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:16,640
uh,
hip hop and rap,

2700
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:20,910
gangster rap being created to promote um,

2701
02:46:21,530 --> 02:46:26,000
crime.
So conspiracy theory,

2702
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:30,530
welfare is any loan in there,

2703
02:46:30,531 --> 02:46:34,580
long beach apartments trying to
figure it out or the private prisons.

2704
02:46:34,581 --> 02:46:36,170
People profiting off prisons.
Right.

2705
02:46:38,750 --> 02:46:42,050
If they have any connection to timeline.

2706
02:46:42,051 --> 02:46:44,450
Here's the problem with the timeline
there with the private prisons weren't

2707
02:46:44,451 --> 02:46:47,870
really that popular. Doctors, the
seventies prisons were popular.

2708
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:51,680
Like the rap music really came up.
The original racing wasn't even,

2709
02:46:51,681 --> 02:46:55,730
but it wasn't even a real gangster rap.
It was gangsta rap. The way we're talking,

2710
02:46:56,140 --> 02:46:59,270
like when the Bronx was on fire,

2711
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:03,960
I'll close to specifically gangsta rap.
That's

2712
02:47:05,980 --> 02:47:07,330
the conspiracy theory,

2713
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:10,970
get to the next level and
that the gangster rap from
Compton and all that shit,

2714
02:47:10,971 --> 02:47:14,810
but he came from New York, man. It came
from when the Bronx was a game came from.

2715
02:47:14,810 --> 02:47:17,960
That's where we're asked to wrap though.
Came from rap came from New York.

2716
02:47:17,961 --> 02:47:22,961
That whole story with the security
deniable that like ice tea and Nwa and ice

2717
02:47:23,721 --> 02:47:27,390
cube. That's think about that to help him.

2718
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:32,420
They would end up Niggas for lies and more
new. But yeah, you guys remember that.

2719
02:47:32,421 --> 02:47:35,120
The album Niggas for life,
that's what it was called.

2720
02:47:36,210 --> 02:47:39,950
The Mexican says,
no,

2721
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:42,650
he can't kill hookers.

2722
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:46,440
They had little skits in
between the songs and they,

2723
02:47:46,441 --> 02:47:50,020
they're at a song about a gang raping.
A 14 girl.

2724
02:47:50,100 --> 02:47:53,840
You go in a drive in that
day had a song about,

2725
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:58,800
she swallowed it. It's called, she
swallow those 90 to half involved.

2726
02:47:59,010 --> 02:48:02,810
We fucking, how did they get away
with that? Because we hadn't evolved.

2727
02:48:02,811 --> 02:48:06,230
We didn't know what it meant.
Dude. Straight outta Compton
had killed the police.

2728
02:48:06,231 --> 02:48:10,370
You know. That's right. Fuck the pope.
Wasn't that when public enemy or is that,

2729
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:15,740
that's Nwa. Public enemy had some harsh
songs. They got away with a lot of shit.

2730
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:17,990
Fuck the police.

2731
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:22,580
That's the worst thing you
could see at a concert saying,

2732
02:48:22,581 --> 02:48:26,150
fuck the police storm that you're jumping
when you talk about like the gangster

2733
02:48:26,151 --> 02:48:28,160
rap in La are kind of jumping up.

2734
02:48:28,161 --> 02:48:32,980
You're not gangster rap started
incompetent representing York because

2735
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:40,510
there's sip up and then there's
gangster rap. It's ended up, you know,

2736
02:48:40,511 --> 02:48:45,260
as I'm shooting in La, I don't know man.

2737
02:48:45,290 --> 02:48:49,810
No you don't. But I'm out of
my lane. It started in college,

2738
02:48:49,870 --> 02:48:53,930
not talking about it. Bra 88.
Um, I got them about Pavarotti.

2739
02:48:56,420 --> 02:49:01,340
He had a song called the police.
He's not, he died. I've already died.

2740
02:49:02,270 --> 02:49:06,200
He was greatness. I saw him singing
person really live. Yes, I totally shit.

2741
02:49:06,201 --> 02:49:08,970
And he sang Nessun dorma which
you should really listen to it.

2742
02:49:09,270 --> 02:49:11,430
Nessun Dorma no one sleeps.
Listen please.

2743
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:16,120
They no one sang at the met because
they couldn't hit that fucking dope.

2744
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:20,670
They tell us not that his book go ahead,
hit. And I got good things to say.

2745
02:49:20,950 --> 02:49:22,740
That's a,
a play paradox.

2746
02:49:22,741 --> 02:49:25,890
You motherfuckers and the greatest
restaurant in the world via Veneto down in

2747
02:49:25,891 --> 02:49:30,680
fucking Venice. If you don't go
there, you're fucking lost show.

2748
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:34,590
And this show, I can't, there's some
things I get obsessed with and that's it.

2749
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:37,730
That's my restaurant and
fucking pub rock thing.

2750
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:39,810
You fucking sell it out in Australia.

2751
02:49:39,811 --> 02:49:43,380
He's never been to Australia and started
to feel insecure so he gets shut off.

2752
02:49:43,380 --> 02:49:46,410
Sorry. Eastern. Hey, you're making
me feel you're triggering me dude.

2753
02:49:46,710 --> 02:49:50,280
I'm trying shell trial back in Calabasas.
You man,

2754
02:49:51,210 --> 02:49:54,390
shout out to Max Holloway.
Run in Hawaii with an iron fist.

2755
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:58,220
Shout out to Max Holloway was bring
this bitch home. Hold on guys,

2756
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,950
let me get this to the people watching.
How many people? 48,000 you Zit,

2757
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:06,240
couple of people listening. Probably
less now. How many have we got? No,

2758
02:50:06,580 --> 02:50:10,110
probably less dropped us rise talk
now they'll, we had government talk,

2759
02:50:10,111 --> 02:50:14,580
we drop about 10. Sorry,
I brought to a halt.

2760
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:19,480
Fox News kills
another trigger.

2761
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:22,410
You motherfucker,
you're triggering 17 views.

2762
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:27,810
He goes, no, I get why you would
read it. But Joe doesn't have that.

2763
02:50:27,811 --> 02:50:28,950
So why would you tell

2764
02:50:33,090 --> 02:50:35,190
people have stress?
They're listening.

2765
02:50:35,191 --> 02:50:37,830
I want to help you guys don't even
remotely commiserate. You're like, bitch,

2766
02:50:37,831 --> 02:50:41,550
I ain't got that problem.
Save that for Solo.

2767
02:50:43,220 --> 02:50:44,850
Oh God dammit.

2768
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:48,120
We're gonna wrap this up.
But I want to say this.

2769
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:50,510
Sometimes we have these
podcasts and she ain't,

2770
02:50:50,520 --> 02:50:54,390
shit gets crazy and we get heated and
we started smoking pot with drinking.

2771
02:50:54,600 --> 02:50:56,520
And there's like a,
a missing,

2772
02:50:57,140 --> 02:51:01,150
there's an a wrong impression
that some people get that window.

2773
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:03,990
We love each other.
I have the best time.

2774
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:08,940
You no matter what we agree or
disagree on, you know, I think it's uh,

2775
02:51:09,630 --> 02:51:10,240
it's important.

2776
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:11,460
This is a family man.
I've,

2777
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:14,970
I've had a lot of arguments with my
brother and my cousins and stuff and it's

2778
02:51:14,971 --> 02:51:15,900
like,
you know,

2779
02:51:15,901 --> 02:51:20,550
you are mad and you aren't going back
and forth and I'm like fuck that you said

2780
02:51:20,551 --> 02:51:23,550
that and he said this. But when
it, when it's all said and done man

2781
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:27,590
it's good

2782
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:30,620
cause I respect your opinion.
I respect your opinion.

2783
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:35,300
I know Jamie,
I've got quite know all you guys.

2784
02:51:35,301 --> 02:51:39,290
I respect everyone in this room's opinion
and I think it's very important even

2785
02:51:39,291 --> 02:51:42,860
if you don't agree with someone's opinion
to be confronted by it because I think

2786
02:51:42,861 --> 02:51:44,030
if everybody just look,

2787
02:51:44,031 --> 02:51:48,590
we've all been around that one person
or many people like especially like old

2788
02:51:48,591 --> 02:51:49,670
time celebrities,

2789
02:51:49,820 --> 02:51:52,550
celebrities that are famous in like
the seventies and the 80s and shit when

2790
02:51:52,551 --> 02:51:54,520
there was no internet and then they,

2791
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:57,890
this never felt this need to
check themselves. Sure. You know,

2792
02:51:57,950 --> 02:51:59,330
they were never informed.

2793
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:03,260
And I think that one of the best things
about having a group of friends like you

2794
02:52:03,261 --> 02:52:07,660
guys and like all of our comedian and
I think all of our Jujitsu friends too.

2795
02:52:07,661 --> 02:52:10,600
And I think that's one of the things
that kind of ties it all together.

2796
02:52:10,840 --> 02:52:15,030
You get a different,
a different group of humans who,

2797
02:52:15,050 --> 02:52:17,010
who've experienced a lot of weird shit,
who,

2798
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:21,910
a different group and you have a different
point of view than me on a lot of

2799
02:52:21,911 --> 02:52:26,380
shit. Whether it's MMA, whether it's,
um, I mean there's always, we always, we,

2800
02:52:26,381 --> 02:52:31,381
you and I have had spirited discussions
about shit that we agreed or disagreed

2801
02:52:31,631 --> 02:52:33,880
on the entire time we've been friends.

2802
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:37,720
But you can do that and
still be cool to each other.

2803
02:52:37,721 --> 02:52:39,070
And I think that's
what's really important.

2804
02:52:39,071 --> 02:52:42,700
I think also the great thing
about friendships after you
get to be my age anyway,

2805
02:52:42,701 --> 02:52:45,280
and you spend a lot of time with people,
is that this is getting very,

2806
02:52:45,350 --> 02:52:47,580
I want some violin music,
but this is serious

2807
02:52:51,370 --> 02:52:55,840
music coming up. You're coming up now.
Here's what I want to say. Hey man,

2808
02:52:56,120 --> 02:52:59,560
you gotta be frank there. Gets it.
They get to a point with friendship.

2809
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:02,110
You know where I was
thinking about this with you,

2810
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:04,210
like you could do pretty much anything.

2811
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:06,700
You're never not going to
be my friend no matter what.

2812
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:10,390
The only thing that would maybe question
is if you heard a child, God forbid,

2813
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:14,020
or if you were drawing animals in
your basement, then I'd be like,

2814
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:18,090
ah fucking guy. But you
know what I mean, guys,

2815
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:22,760
don't help you bury somebody back.
Exactly. That's exactly right. Feet

2816
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:26,110
touching her breasts.
There's only,

2817
02:53:26,350 --> 02:53:29,590
I mean there's a fucking small handful
of people that I would call if I murdered

2818
02:53:29,591 --> 02:53:33,220
somebody there in this room. Yeah, I
would, I would. It'd be a burner. Call me.

2819
02:53:34,030 --> 02:53:38,830
Don't call you. Call the loyal dog first.
Cause I do it. Listen, we're all fucking,

2820
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:42,550
he'd get scared and go, I have a
tummy ache. I got a tummy ache.

2821
02:53:42,550 --> 02:53:44,260
But Malibu was only six months old

2822
02:53:46,930 --> 02:53:51,550
electrical class. My dog's afraid
and living to do root cause.

2823
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:54,130
The first guy you call
your dog right here.

2824
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:57,980
Last time we did one of these podcasts,
got 10 million downloads, Chris,

2825
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:00,033
the last time.

2826
02:54:00,520 --> 02:54:05,350
It's probably the biggest thing other
than the Alex Jones episode number one,

2827
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:08,900
number one, and Alex Jones is
one of the Alex Jones episodes,

2828
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:13,920
one of the best pieces of evidence that
there's some potential opening for some

2829
02:54:14,051 --> 02:54:18,610
sort of a conspiracy to keep some people
down because the Alex Jones episode,

2830
02:54:18,611 --> 02:54:22,510
not only did he get more downloads
in any podcast we've ever done ever,

2831
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:25,780
but he got more by like
what 4 million deep state,

2832
02:54:27,340 --> 02:54:31,180
the deep state cooking, lots of silence
him. It's up to 15 million, but no,

2833
02:54:31,181 --> 02:54:33,940
here's what they did do and
I don't think that they look,

2834
02:54:33,941 --> 02:54:36,340
it could be catastrophic coincidence,

2835
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:41,640
but during the time when the ounce Jones
episode wet running through the charts

2836
02:54:43,750 --> 02:54:47,850
of our art, like downloads, we
get like if I have a number,

2837
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:49,690
like this is my number one,
this is my number two,

2838
02:54:50,170 --> 02:54:54,990
the Alex Jones is 5 million
downloads ahead of everything.

2839
02:54:55,630 --> 02:54:56,680
Now here's the crazy thing.

2840
02:54:56,740 --> 02:54:59,770
Itunes ratings went down and I
don't think they went down on focus.

2841
02:54:59,830 --> 02:55:03,560
I don't think they went down on
purpose, right? Lead just his ears.

2842
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:04,800
They coincidentally,

2843
02:55:05,340 --> 02:55:06,500
this is what's undeniable.

2844
02:55:06,501 --> 02:55:11,000
They coincidentally went down the very
time that the Alex Jones podcast was

2845
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:13,430
rampaging through the tribe state.

2846
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:18,460
Now my podcast oftentimes reached number
one on the iTunes charts in terms of

2847
02:55:19,101 --> 02:55:21,820
like the podcast episodes.
Oftentimes if it's a real,

2848
02:55:21,890 --> 02:55:25,410
if it's Lawrence Krauss or Sam Harris
or you know, maybe even this, this way.

2849
02:55:25,790 --> 02:55:29,000
So when that does happen, I've
got to say Whoa, fuck podcast.

2850
02:55:29,001 --> 02:55:34,001
Got 5 million downloads more
than any podcast I've ever done.

2851
02:55:34,430 --> 02:55:36,110
Ever. Yeah, for sure.

2852
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:40,970
That one's going to be number one
and not only was it not number one,

2853
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:43,460
but hold on, hold on. Here we got here.

2854
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:48,740
Itunes is being gangster honors
about, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2855
02:55:48,741 --> 02:55:52,520
Shut the fuck up. What Jamie currently
number three and four overall. Okay.

2856
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:53,610
We are our pot.

2857
02:55:53,750 --> 02:55:58,100
The episodes to Alex Jones podcast never
got past like number 20 or so crazy.

2858
02:55:58,430 --> 02:55:59,121
Yeah.
Not only that,

2859
02:55:59,121 --> 02:56:02,900
but the ones after it and the ones before
they got way less downloads were all

2860
02:56:02,901 --> 02:56:05,810
ranked higher. All rank tires.
Do you think it's because,

2861
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:10,400
because I listened to that and you guys
got so fucking crazy towards the end

2862
02:56:10,580 --> 02:56:14,420
dimensional shot molester. You guys got,
you all got Hillary completely nuts.

2863
02:56:14,421 --> 02:56:18,230
I had, I had turned you
guys off. I listened to two
hours and I was like, well,

2864
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:19,170
now we're in killed.

2865
02:56:21,930 --> 02:56:25,720
Get good until hour three. It was not,
not try this now almost three hours.

2866
02:56:25,760 --> 02:56:29,150
I was like, oh no, my God, I think people
turn, they went to, they're too drunk.

2867
02:56:29,151 --> 02:56:32,450
You guys got too drunk and be honest
with you, got too high and dry was fine.

2868
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:37,500
People got pissed. People, God, whoever.

2869
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:40,640
I had so much heat and publicly
Cholos and shit got mad at me.

2870
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:44,900
Gangbangers gangbanger got fucking man,
Alex Jones Kid. He started thinking,

2871
02:56:44,901 --> 02:56:47,960
he started going, he'd go like
metallic Tara. Tara Trump told me,

2872
02:56:48,370 --> 02:56:51,730
and then you guys just go off on
another fucking tell us about that.

2873
02:56:52,270 --> 02:56:55,730
But he was high. But that's what
Alex, Alex, to tell you one subject,

2874
02:56:55,731 --> 02:56:56,541
they'll turn corners.

2875
02:56:56,541 --> 02:56:59,690
George Soros making the marijuana stronger
and then next thing you know if the

2876
02:56:59,691 --> 02:57:03,080
astronauts really did lay on the front,
but the problem was they found aliens.

2877
02:57:03,081 --> 02:57:05,900
They're like, hey, hey, hey,
hey. Have you ever seen,

2878
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:11,030
he goes back and forth and back and back.
Damn,

2879
02:57:13,850 --> 02:57:18,440
he got you. Hey, sit
back. Wait, wait, wait.

2880
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:27,770
Stop it this whole time. This whole
time. I'm the crazy motherfucker

2881
02:57:29,410 --> 02:57:31,370
and I go,
one of these days,

2882
02:57:31,430 --> 02:57:35,840
he's been friends with Alec Johnson's
fucking 1998 he should've been on Alex

2883
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:38,060
Jones. Should have been on
episode three or four or five.

2884
02:57:38,330 --> 02:57:42,440
We ended up being 911 finally,
I waited all this time.

2885
02:57:42,441 --> 02:57:46,840
I knew what I was go this time. I go,
oh, should I even asked Janko Dude,

2886
02:57:46,850 --> 02:57:50,810
let me fucking jump on that bitch. I had
a, I never knew that. I never do that.

2887
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:54,140
I did that for Paul Stanley
and kiss shit didn't work out,

2888
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:58,880
but I was in town and I said, I can't
make it. I'm going to be out of town.

2889
02:57:58,970 --> 02:58:02,480
But it turned out you were good
though. But anyways, I showed up and,

2890
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:04,620
and I'm thinking finally,

2891
02:58:04,770 --> 02:58:08,190
someone else is going to just talk for me.

2892
02:58:08,370 --> 02:58:11,240
And for the first hour I didn't
say shit right and doing nothing.

2893
02:58:11,510 --> 02:58:16,360
I didn't say nothing. I didn't say
you're an augurous chem trail. Shit.

2894
02:58:16,430 --> 02:58:21,000
[inaudible] and me and Alex Jones have
talked about chem trails and he knows so

2895
02:58:21,090 --> 02:58:23,820
he knows a thousand times more
about chem trails than I do.

2896
02:58:24,030 --> 02:58:28,050
He has the documents memorized in his
head. He's got a photographic memory.

2897
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:32,430
So I finally wanted, I finally
talked after an hour and let him go.

2898
02:58:32,550 --> 02:58:36,840
He wowed the whole world.
Everyone's like, oh shit. Oh Shit,

2899
02:58:36,841 --> 02:58:39,480
we're getting fucked here
we are getting fucked.

2900
02:58:39,990 --> 02:58:43,190
And then I decided to bring
the chem trails up and he
didn't want to talk about,

2901
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:45,090
he want to talk about Trump,
you want to keep going on Trump.

2902
02:58:45,091 --> 02:58:48,870
And I wanted to go chem trails and I
kinda, I got Kinda pissed, you know,

2903
02:58:48,871 --> 02:58:52,680
and I was like, fuck, I've been waiting
this whole fucking time. Why do you,

2904
02:58:52,720 --> 02:58:55,250
why are you so obsessed with chem trails?
What is it about chemistry?

2905
02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:59,370
It's just scared air. It's
just hair. I don't know.

2906
02:58:59,371 --> 02:59:01,770
It's just there for some
reason I think airs important.

2907
02:59:02,010 --> 02:59:04,770
10 25 I've got to get out of here. I've
got a spot at the store. You got a spot,
