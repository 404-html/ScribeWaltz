1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,800
Why wouldn't we assume that the reason
why we're so conflicted and weird is

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:09,030
because that's the proper mechanism that
needs to be in place for people to move

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,980
forward in the direction
that we're moving forward.

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:11,241
It'd be,

6
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:16,241
it'd be constantly chasing technology
without any real clear sort of a rational

7
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,970
approach to using our
resources and looking at the
problems that we have because

8
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:25,230
we're like a bunch of little kids that
have like shit all over their house,

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,180
but instead we're,

10
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,260
we're outside working on the garden,

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,711
you know,

12
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,491
we're planting trees,

13
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,250
we're not cleaning up the shit that we
piled up in the middle of the living room

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,370
and it keeps piling up every day to the
point where we can't even live in our

15
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,340
house anymore and we're concentrating
on some shit that's not even ours.

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,460
Do you think you could ever,

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,650
you probably couldn't,

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,640
but maybe in your,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,540
maybe it stayed,

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,560
like if you didn't have kids,

21
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,331
in fact big family.

22
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:48,210
So do you think you could ever live in
like one of those airstream trailers by

23
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:48,631
myself?

24
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,110
Fuck yeah.

25
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,861
Cause I was recently,

26
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,550
I recently went to Joshua tree and
one of those and I was thinking like,

27
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,770
really this is all I really need and
I could take my whole fucking house

28
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,581
anywhere I want.

29
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,160
And the new ones have
like nice wood floors

30
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,210
and some of them expand out.

31
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:01,990
You know,

32
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,261
there's,

33
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:02,860
there's been,

34
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,340
um,

35
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,940
you know,

36
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,690
a lot of people that are moving
towards minimalist houses,

37
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,870
really small houses,

38
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,170
but there's a bunch of online that
show like how certain people live.

39
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,400
And it's kind of interesting,

40
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:12,611
you know,

41
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:16,090
like one guy figured out a way to have
like this little tiny cooking area and he

42
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:17,770
pulls the bed out in the bed,

43
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:18,371
comes out of the wall.

44
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,920
He lives by himself and he has
like some storage up in top,

45
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:22,540
like toilet paper and
things along those lines.

46
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,650
But it's a tiny,

47
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,020
tiny little house and a
little kitchen dinette area.

48
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,891
And you know,

49
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:27,790
the idea is that like,

50
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:28,180
really,

51
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,690
why do we have to have this giant fucking
footprint of House that we live in?

52
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:31,961
You know,

53
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:32,490
and

54
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,690
these guys are getting paid,

55
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,350
bitch,

56
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,850
if all I live in a fucking cell,

57
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,680
I'll live in a fucking
sound like a monkey.

58
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm going to live on a fault

59
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,930
Puerto Rican that gets
a check on the fifth.

60
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,830
Go Fuck your mother.

61
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
If you get paid,

62
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,230
you live in a fucking house.

63
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,990
I'm going to live in a Mike Rowe
fucking house with a little kitchen.

64
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,591
The Cook,

65
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,690
like I got a black guy back
at me in the fucking ass.

66
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,673
I don't need that.

67
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,180
You spread out even me.

68
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,014
I'm no millionaire.

69
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,520
I've got a big fucking kitchen,

70
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,450
a micro house.

71
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,790
What do you fucking people talking about?

72
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,160
I just not thought of it though.

73
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:04,230
You can't take me into
those deep waters like Rico.

74
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,910
Fucking kill the brother right now.

75
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,460
A fucking house with a bed upside down.

76
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,580
Fuck that shit to say vantage of fuck you.

77
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:12,330
You get paid.

78
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,000
You fucking live like a normal
person going to Trump and say,

79
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:15,834
hey wig.

80
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,930
Move into a fucking thing to say but
it to see if you don't pick slap you.

81
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,340
If you don't have a Russian bitch
slapping in the fucking fire,

82
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,790
the fuck are these people,

83
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,680
micro houses in the fucking desert.

84
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,640
You play it out to the world
that like a doctor like a doctor.

85
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,750
You live your fucking life.

86
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,380
You're right.

87
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,220
Dooms Day.

88
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,320
I'm going to put a can of tomato soup
under my stairs to wait for the Marshall

89
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,960
to come.

90
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,651
When it's over,

91
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,041
it's over.

92
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,650
You got when they with your Dick out
and you take your fucking chances like a

93
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,190
man.

94
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,480
I'm gonna live like I fucking old.

95
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,940
$20 to a bookmaker downstairs in my house.

96
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,010
Get the fuck out of my face.

97
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,890
I want to live in one of the airstream.

98
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,871
Brian's down.

99
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:50,590
Joey's not.

100
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,120
I think we have a real clear line.

101
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,790
We feel like you're in one.

102
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,431
When you're in there,

103
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:55,551
it's,

104
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:55,730
it's,

105
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,563
it's pretty.

106
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,280
So somebody farts and you're in four
fucking speak for Lisa and you're like,

107
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,100

a smell your asshole.

108
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,420
Get the fuck Outta here.

109
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,590
Because everything's great.

110
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,424
In a small space.

111
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,920
They'll suddenly blows a fucking for
you will walk into a bathroom at the,

112
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,680
some of the Oh shit bothers you.

113
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,760
Even if they're your mother.

114
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,650
You look at them like
you dirty fucking Vicks,

115
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,484

116
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,620
slumped it live.

117
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,760
Nothing small.

118
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,511
Fuck that shit,

119
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:19,691
Bro.

120
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,524
Especially,

121
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm never home though.

122
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,001
You know,

123
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:22,870
like I work so much.

124
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,641
I'm never hiding.

125
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:24,810
You're always fucking hall.

126
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,733
I'm home asleep.

127
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,580
Yeah.
