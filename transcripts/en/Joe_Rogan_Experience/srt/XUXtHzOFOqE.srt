1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,280
Okay,

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,510
this is how we're going to start off.
We're going to build today.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:16,511
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to start slow and we're 

4
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:16,580
going to build gregory.
How are you buddy?

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,190
Joseph,
we have to talk about Jesus.

6
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,720
We got elite trip.
We were both overlapped in Italy.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,500
I fucking love the bit you're doing 
about the guy over there.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,850
I don't want to give away,
but say I,

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,970
I'll just say sky.
I saw a guy walking down the street and 

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:35,970
my sister pointed out,
uh,

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,050
he,
the automated over there,

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,940
like you see Italian Americans are kind 
of animated Italian Italians,

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,790
guys walking down the street on his cell
phone and I don't know what he's saying.

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:47,600
And he's,
and he's,

15
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,430
he's getting so animated.
He stops,

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,760
puts his briefcase down so he can pinch 
his fingers together and wave his hand 

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,961
up and down with a cigarette dangling.

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,800
And have you seen the Italian Dan 
Bilzerian?

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,370
Now there's an Italian version of Dan 
Bilzerian.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,320
She got Dan Bilzerian,
who's this super wealthy poker player,

21
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:15,410
gambler character,
international playboy type dude,

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,100
worth fucking hundreds of millions of 
dollars and just every picture is him in

23
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,860
a jet and him getting blown by 50 
chicks,

24
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:26,861
you know,
well there's this guy in Italy and all 

25
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:27,950
he does is take videos of him and it's 
super hot.

26
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:32,951
Fiance dancing and apparently he's a 
huge celebrity in Italy and he's an 

27
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:34,400
older guy.
Yeah,

28
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,920
we stopped that.
He's actually my age,

29
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:41,921
but he just looks old or 50 year old 
millionaire is cooler than Dan 

30
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:41,921
Bilzerian.
Oh,

31
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,640
he's fucking rip.
Shredded,

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,250
tatted up.
And he could dance.

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,410
Go to his instagram page.
One of them became famous.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,130
No,
that's not it.

35
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,140
It's one with him and the girl it 
became.

36
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,100
Yeah,
that's this page.

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,100
Um,
I'll tell you,

38
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:57,930
uh,
scroll down.

39
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,160
Keep scrolling down.
No,

40
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,490
no,
no.

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,800
Just scroll down a little.
I'll tell you which one to click on.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,980
He's got a gang of them on his page,
but one of them sort of caught fire on 

43
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,241
the Internet and people started paying 
attention to it and then it became this 

44
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,390
big thing.
Little bit more.

45
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,000
It's all just pictures.
No,

46
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,990
there's some fee.
That's it.

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,330
The lefthand side.
That's one of them.

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,760
Yeah.
That's just one of them.

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,260
This is not even the best one.

50
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,050
He's been,
I mean it's like him and his girl like 

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,440
dancing and she's hot as fuck.
And uh,

52
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,180
even though he's my age,
this dude is like,

53
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,260
well,
leathered from the son.

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,390
Yeah.
He's constantly out in the sun.

55
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,630
He's never worn sunblock in his life.
No.

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,660
No.
Or Has Shea?

57
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,270
Did I give a fuck?
Look at the body on her.

58
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,330
Oh my God.
He's in great shape to man feet.

59
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,810
Beautiful thing.
What I mean,

60
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,030
but I mean,
this is a,

61
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,750
this is what it is.
A dude basically in his underwear with a

62
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,810
girl in her underwear and they're all 
sweaty and dancing around on a,

63
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,730
on a gorgeous rooftop rooftop villa with
a pool.

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,530
Yeah.
They're just super bawling through super

65
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,460
and publicly.
Yeah.

66
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,590
Sometimes I see rappers and they've got 
the yacht.

67
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,170
They've got all that,
and then they've got this down.

68
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,570
Our face painted on embryo.

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,140
Looked like,
dude,

70
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:28,270
do you realize you're on the roof of a 
fucking,

71
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,690
you know,
a yacht and you got beautiful women 

72
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:33,690
standing around jazz music.
What do you get involved?

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,410
A little bit harder out there.
Chris Brown here.

74
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,090
What happened?
I just saw that he was uh,

75
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,320
arrested.
I don't know,

76
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,700
I um,
I turned on the TV yesterday at noon and

77
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,190
this is the first I'd heard of it.
There was a standoff at his house and I 

78
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,190
was like,
what?

79
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,930
Like Damn,
what the hell is this?

80
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,420
So apparently they had been there since 
3:00

81
00:03:55,421 --> 00:04:00,421
in the morning,
so they'd already been there for nine 

82
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:00,421
hours.
Wow.

83
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:00,610
Yeah.
And the,

84
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,630
they didn't have a warrant but they were
surrounding his house and the helicopter

85
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,490
footage of it.
So the shown it on the news,

86
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,070
helicopters circling,
Chris Brown's house,

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,100
cops all down the driveway.
He lives on a cul de sac.

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,010
So there's all these cops all lined up 
down the street.

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,350
Cops everywhere.
Like a ton of cops.

90
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,410
Like they're responding like this is an 
armed dangerous guy.

91
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,600
Like they would any other armed 
dangerous guy.

92
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,110
And it's just him.
It's just him and apparently some girl,

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,000
he might've had some friends at home 
with them,

94
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:33,001
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure it was just him and 

95
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:34,390
he said they were at some party or 
something like that and the girl said he

96
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:38,470
pulled a gun on him.
He pulled the gun on her and um,

97
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,750
so I guess she called the cops and you 
know,

98
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,870
there was more people there that had a 
story I heard was that a friend of his 

99
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,960
had a bunch of jewelry out and party 
made.

100
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,720
Her and her friend went to look at the 
jewelry when they start asking about the

101
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,690
jewelry,
Chris freaked out on him and said,

102
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,720
get the fuck out of my house.

103
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,630
I don't want you to girls here anymore.
And one of his friends grabbed her phone

104
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:56,850
and tried to say like,
we don't,

105
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm not gonna give it back to you to 
sign an NDA.

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,750
And then she said she wouldn't do it.
Snatched her phone around.

107
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,130
Now this was according to her.
That too.

108
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:07,270
So it is,
it's hard out there for a pimp.

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
Sketchy.
All around.

110
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.
She all around,

111
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:10,510
right?
I mean,

112
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:15,511
it's like,
what do you say about something like 

113
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,861
that?
Like what the fuck really happened and 

114
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:16,861
why is your friend showing jewelry?
Her house.

115
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:19,630
I mean every detail of it is twisted.
It's also stupid.

116
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,170
So he makes a ton of videos and puts 
them on instagram.

117
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,460
Chris Brown.
Yeah.

118
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,430
Have him,
you know,

119
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,680
given his side of what things are and 
he's keeping it real essentially.

120
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Yeah.
There's videos and it's his and he's 

121
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,220
smoking a cigarette.

122
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,440
It's,
it's very sketch.

123
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,500
So they didn't hold on him.
They arrested him and rest of the fuck 

124
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,500
out of them.
Yeah.

125
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,780
Uh,
I don't know if they kept them,

126
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,290
but I mean they went in and they booked 
him for assault with a deadly weapon or 

127
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,700
attempted assault with a deadly weapon.
Is that what it is?

128
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,380
How long until he.
He's saying that the cops were roughing 

129
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,581
him up.
I'm sure they have video footage of 

130
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:56,581
everything.
They wouldn't be crazy.

131
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:57,500
That would be crazy not to.
Yeah,

132
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
something like that.
Like who the fuck is under age cousin 

133
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,820
and then piss on somebody.
No,

134
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,840
those are Kelly.
How you could fit like three different 

135
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,520
black people.
I don't know who fuck their cousin,

136
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,380
but r Kelly was peeing on.
People didn't use to put less lately and

137
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,400
molest them.
No,

138
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,690
that's the other guy.
That's bill cosby.

139
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,130
Oh,
got it.

140
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,630
Jesus Christ and that crazy.
Like,

141
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:27,050
what the fuck man.
I can't tell black people heart.

142
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,170
I just realized that you confused Art 
Kelly and Chris Brown.

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,620
Is that bad when they,
they are off by like 15,

144
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,490
20 years.

145
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,790
What if one of them is our age?
Our Kelly is,

146
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,840
he's 49.
And when did he play basketball?

147
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,090
He didn't play basketball.
He's a singer.

148
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,350
A singer.
Got It.

149
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,790
Yeah.
Um,

150
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,460
I don't know any of his songs other than
the really hilarious ones.

151
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,100
What?
Have you ever heard real talk now?

152
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,470
Oh my goodness.
I wish we could play it,

153
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:02,540
but we'd get.
We'd get the boot off the youtube.

154
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,170
I got to play it for you.
It's fucking brilliant.

155
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,690
Fucking brilliant.
And it's humorous.

156
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,060
Not on purpose.
Oh No,

157
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,550
it's,
it's all about him getting in an 

158
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,990
argument with a girl on the phone.
See if we could play.

159
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,810
Part of it will play part of it.
Why did they quit?

160
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,580
Part off Youtube.
Yeah,

161
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,581
dude,
they have a computer that does it have 

162
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:27,830
you play someone song?
You don't have permission.

163
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,510
If you show a video,
you don't have permission,

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,560
you know,
people own their property.

165
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,730
So if some guy has a video.
Here was an issue with.

166
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,770
There was a guy like wildlife videos.
Carmen had a video of a crocodile 

167
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,870
walking across a golf course.
Do you see that giant crack?

168
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,390
We're alligator.
Huge,

169
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,950
huge.
Like 15 feet long.

170
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:47,951
Enormous.
I put it up on my facebook because I 

171
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,400
just retweeted like a youtube video that
somebody posted up or I'll put a link up

172
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,540
to elect,
check this shit out.

173
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,570
That's all he did.
I didn't upload it to facebook and 

174
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:55,940
facebook took my account down for like 
three days.

175
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,650
No Shit.
Yeah,

176
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,660
they wouldn't let me post a video for 
three days.

177
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,720
So what's the lesson there is somebody 
owns the sweet.

178
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,650
Anything.
It's not.

179
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,900
I don't.
I don't think it was correctly done.

180
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,110
I don't know.
I think maybe I retweeted someone who 

181
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,110
had illegally put it up or something 
like that.

182
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I don't remember the full details of it 
because I retweet shit constantly when 

183
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,190
people send me something that's cool.
I'm like,

184
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,920
I would want to see this.
So I sent it to everybody.

185
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,330
That's.
Yeah,

186
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,400
they shouldn't penalize it.
Retweet.

187
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,430
That's crazy.
I mean maybe I put a link up to the 

188
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,361
video,
but I definitely didn't upload the 

189
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:31,361
video.
Somebody else's video.

190
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:31,430
It was on,
you know,

191
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,330
whatever it was,
whatever.

192
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,040
Live leak.
Who knows what the fuck was on,

193
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:38,180
but somebody decided they own that video
and it's got more than $20 million hits.

194
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:43,181
Now.
It's like when a video becomes that 

195
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,311
popular,
I think they can make a fuck load of 

196
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,311
money from it.
Yeah.

197
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,880
It becomes like a television show,
right?

198
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,020
You know.
So if we play this will get kicked off 

199
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,800
of Youtube,
but you got to hear it.

200
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,330
So this part is not on Youtube,
right?

201
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,290
People can't hear it.
This is Chris Brown.

202
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,430
No,
you got two things going on at the same 

203
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,430
hint.
You know Jamie,

204
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,890
Jamie Young,
Jamie's captain tabs,

205
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,570
he loves them tabs.

206
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,270
This is

207
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:14,150
for the people listening with this is is
he's sitting there,

208
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,960
he's got a box of cigars,
is opening up.

209
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,890
He's got sunglasses on and he says,
I'm just going to be real.

210
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,780
I'm just going to be real.
It's got Gucci Sunglasses that say Gucci

211
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,660
across the front.
They have to and so he's pouring himself

212
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:34,661
a nice drink.
He's got a stoke ego and he's calling 

213
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,840
this girl down.
I was at a club with who?

214
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,590
What was keeping a rail?
It's called real talk,

215
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,021
real talk.
I'm trying to establish what's wrong and

216
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:01,371
while he's talking to her and another 
girl braiding his hair because she saw 

217
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,500
me at the club with some other bitches.

218
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,370
Tell me girl,

219
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,210
did she say there were other guys there?

220
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,310
This is.

221
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,660
That is.
Well there other guys there will tell me

222
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,700
this back that up.
We going to hear that again.

223
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,730
It's not even a lyric gets shifted.
Him Ranting to a friend with a beat 

224
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,200
under it.
Just play a little bit of that just by a

225
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:35,620
little bit.

226
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,330
How the fuck shit.
God Damn it.

227
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,310
He's good.
Like he's living in it.

228
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,370
It's like if he's a brilliant comedian,
I'm just a brilliant Andy Kaufman Times 

229
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:11,561
a hundred and he's committed to this 
character and he's like literally going 

230
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,970
out peed on girls on video just for this
character like that,

231
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:19,030
that debt is.
He's like delivering it in the most 

232
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,090
subtle of parodies.
Well,

233
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,730
when we this then when I was down in ice
to write for a show,

234
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:23,650
you know,
tei,

235
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,340
the rapper,
the rapper,

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,180
he's like an Atlanta based kind of 
gangster rapper.

237
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,960
Arcelio has 40 more chapters of trapped 
in the closet.

238
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:37,310
Planned what's trapped in the closet.
He didn't write a book.

239
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,110
No,
it's way better than a book.

240
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,440
It's like a musical,
like a story gets told over a rap 

241
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,290
musical with the most proponderous 
lyrics of all time.

242
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,880
Like he wrote them five minutes before 
he decided to film this whole thing.

243
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,420
It's a south park parody to the whole 
thing on it to south park did a whole 

244
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,130
thing with Tom Cruise.
Tom Cruise is in the closet.

245
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,050
It was like,
Oh yeah,

246
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:07,051
I saw it was like a scientology gay 
double whammy attack.

247
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh,
and they use trapped in the closet.

248
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,790
That's already 33 chapters to it.
Oh Jesus.

249
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,300
So it's doing well.
Do People love him?

250
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,860
Yeah.
They love that guy.

251
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,430
Was it?
He's like the bump and grind guys at 

252
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,430
him?
No.

253
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,060
Is that him?
And I believe I can fly from space jam.

254
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,940
Oh,
that's it.

255
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,500
That did it.
That did it.

256
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:28,930
That touched a lot of people's hearts.
Jamie.

257
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,220
That was his song.
I believe I can fly out.

258
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,880
She's got a good voice.
Yeah.

259
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,260
Oh,
he's got a great voice.

260
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,850
Yeah.
Got a great voice.

261
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,020
But God damn that video is awesome.
Yeah,

262
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,580
that Shit's awesome.
And he just imagine waking up in the 

263
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,611
morning and being that guy and deciding 
I'm going to wear that purple Fuchsia 

264
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:51,460
studded jacket today.
I'm going to get high immediately.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,070
You could do it.
You can kind of.

266
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:56,740
Anybody could come and do it.
When did the pitches get there?

267
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,850
It's a good question.
Like,

268
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:00,040
do you call the bitches or do they just 
show up?

269
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,980
Um,
I think they just come with the contract

270
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:03,430
or something.

271
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,190
Yeah,
right.

272
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,330
You don't get your security deposit back
if they're dead.

273
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,720
They just,
they're just there.

274
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,730
Yeah.
Like the,

275
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,250
it's like a natural ecosystem,
you know,

276
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,880
if you look at a,
a reef,

277
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,460
what does it happen as,
as crabs,

278
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,160
as plankton,
feeder fish,

279
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,010
or do you have expensive cars?
Yes.

280
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,000
Earlier mansions.
Yes.

281
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,860
This is jewelry involved?
Yes.

282
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:27,970
Okay.
Well the bitches will be there.

283
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
They'll find their way.
They heard it,

284
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,700
heard about it.
It's,

285
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,710
it's like they've got a friend at the 
jewelry store gone get his bag of 

286
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,850
diamonds going 30 to 100 ml holidays.
Smell it in the air.

287
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,510
There's a certain kind of Hoochie Mama 
that just smells that stuff.

288
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah.
She just shows up.

289
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,400
Yep.
That's what I mean.

290
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:50,020
If studying nature,
it's like an outsider looking at humans.

291
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,770
That's what you should do is like a bear
grylls kind of a show.

292
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,090
But it's just you exploring like social 
phenomenons,

293
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:03,091
like r Kelly,
treating them like they're in the wild 

294
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:07,800
will treating.
There's a lot of stuff you could treat 

295
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:07,900
like that if you just studied it like as
a scientist.

296
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,910
Right?
Wouldn't you want to get involved with 

297
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,731
like Rodeo culture?
Like tell them you wouldn't want to be 

298
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:15,670
around the people that are like ultra 
Rodeo.

299
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,550
People that love Rodeo,
hang out with them.

300
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm like,
be with them like everyday for like a 

301
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:23,600
couple months,
like Lutheran style.

302
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,910
Embed yourself.
Like Luther,

303
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:29,911
when he does these documentaries,
he goes to a place like you went to 

304
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:29,911
Africa for like three months.
Yeah.

305
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,440
And hung out at a hunting camp,
you know,

306
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,660
and hung out with these people until he 
annoyed them to the point where they got

307
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,160
mad at him,
gave him some good footage.

308
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,230
No Shit.
Oh,

309
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,980
that's what he was looking for.
Not really.

310
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,110
He looking to understand it,
but after a while the best footage came 

311
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,620
out of this guy.
Just getting like really pissed at him.

312
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,650
Yeah.
But I think that if you embedded 

313
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:49,650
yourself in like a.
okay,

314
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,220
how about a coal mining town?
Embed yourself

315
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,030
in a coal mining town.
There's some for the music data.

316
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:59,360
Local girl.
He's got even worse job.

317
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:04,361
Get a job at the end.
Work and live in the mind for a couple 

318
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:04,361
months.
Right.

319
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,630
And then.
And then do,

320
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,040
do something on that.
See,

321
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,340
there's some weird pockets of humanity 
in this fucking country.

322
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:11,820
Yeah.
Just in this country,

323
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:14,000
like forget about the world.
Well,

324
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,540
what about the ultra rich go into a 
country club in West Palm beach that has

325
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,541
no black members and it's all like 
fortune 500 ceos and old fucking money.

326
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:27,010
Just blue blood dripping out of them.
Wow.

327
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,010
He could get access to that here,
but what kind of stock tips are going on

328
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,660
and that steam room,
you know,

329
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:33,560
they're,
they're.

330
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,240
They are the reptilians.
They're deciding when the market goes up

331
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,500
and down,
interest rates,

332
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,900
foreign policy.
It's all happening in that fucking steam

333
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,280
room.
Wow.

334
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,920
There's a lot of that,
right?

335
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,380
Golf Games.
Yup.

336
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,980
How much gets done on golf courses?
Like you almost have to play golf.

337
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,820
If you're like a big time businessman,
man,

338
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,930
you almost have to play golf,
which is time consuming is shit.

339
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,720
Five hours out there.
You've got to get there.

340
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,060
Then there's a drink afterwards.
It's a whole fucking day.

341
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,250
It.
That's the thing about golf is it 

342
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,951
requires the money to join and then also
the wealth to not have to be working 

343
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:11,900
that day.
That's a giant chunk of time.

344
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,550
Yeah.
When Obama Plays Golf,

345
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:18,650
he played golf for that long now because
they'll clear the course for him and 

346
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,220
then they have a four caddies who were 
guys that stand up about a hundred yards

347
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:26,300
ahead of you and they spot your ball,
so by the time you drive up in the cart,

348
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,080
he's already got the ball and he's 
running ahead and so they can.

349
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,480
They probably get around in about two 
and a half hours.

350
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,840
Jesus Christ Bush used to,
used to run golf.

351
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,880
It was this.
I'd never heard of the sport before,

352
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,060
but his family does it.
You Jog and hit the ball and keep 

353
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,870
jogging.
What?

354
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,560
Yeah,
he would play.

355
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,080
He would play golf five minutes.

356
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,150
You're the horse.
I've never even heard of such a thing.

357
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah,
it's like,

358
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,720
you know,
time conservation Bush style.

359
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,230
Well that was one of the only big 
benefits of golf was that you had a walk

360
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:05,231
the course and the course is a lot of 
exercise and you get your exercise in 

361
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:05,330
and people are like,
Eh,

362
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,450
not really into.
The deals are being made back in the 

363
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:10,850
car.
I just want a cart,

364
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,010
it's hooked up with a stereo and a 
cooler.

365
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm Rodney Dangerfield on this shit.
Oh,

366
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,500
how drunk are you allowed to get on a 
golf course?

367
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,010
Well,
you know,

368
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,440
I play golf and I play a lot of these 
celebrity tournaments,

369
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,430
which is like,
you know,

370
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,431
they'll have 18 groups that are going 
out and then each one gets a comedian 

371
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,810
added into the group just to fuck around
and,

372
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:30,920
you know,
entertain.

373
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,300
I don't know if you had to take,
but you know,

374
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,170
they just like to meet somebody and uh,
they have these bark,

375
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:41,171
these,
a cart bars that go around with the 

376
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:41,540
fucking hottest chicks you've ever seen 
in bikini tops.

377
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,840
And they pull up with hard liquor,
beer,

378
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,490
everything.
And they,

379
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:47,330
uh,
they flirt.

380
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,630
And these guys I played with guys that 
like literally are crawling off the 

381
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,190
course when they're done the so shit 
faced.

382
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then you go to the dinner and they 
drink more and then you get up and tell 

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,000
jokes.
Oh my God.

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,170
Try to make them laugh after that shit.
Yeah,

385
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,840
it's a riot.
Wow.

386
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,400
Yeah.
I always pictured golfers.

387
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,070
I always picture him like Ted Kennedy,
like that kind of face.

388
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,310
Yeah.
Writing big fucking overwhelmed tissue 

389
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,691
face like so much inflammation.
Your skin is just running from your 

390
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:20,550
skull.
So dignified and older gentleman.

391
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,680
This spider veins?
Yeah.

392
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,230
The front of the nose is just a giant 
vein wilderness.

393
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,280
There's a bunch of those older guys that
get that from the booze and the heavy 

394
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,820
bag that Newt Gingrich guys got that 
shit going on too.

395
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,710
He's got that.
Uh,

396
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,650
I have a couple of whiskeys and night 
look,

397
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,860
I used to caddy at a country club.
Oh,

398
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,400
what the fuck was I like to workout.
I mean a golf course is about six miles 

399
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,510
and you got to heavy ass bags back then 
everybody had leather bags and you know,

400
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:57,420
extra golf balls in there.
So I'd have to have those.

401
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,990
I weighed about 125 pounds and I would 
just,

402
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,920
just like a fucking mule up and down 
hills and sometimes you get a loop.

403
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,450
Like I had this one guy and he goes,
uh,

404
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,540
he was a ship Golfer anyway.
And I,

405
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,980
it took me all day to find his ball.

406
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,980
And then he hits one out of bounds,
like over a fence into the woods and he 

407
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:15,980
goes,
where's my ball?

408
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,890
I go,
it went in the woods.

409
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:17,790
He goes,
we'll find it.

410
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,440
I go,
you hit it,

411
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,470
you find it.
And the guy fired me on the spot so I 

412
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,470
just quit.
And I didn't carry his bag.

413
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,550
I just put his bags down,
fucking walked in.

414
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,770
Dr Angela.
Lily used to get shit faced and then get

415
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:36,771
into his car.
The parking attendants were telling me 

416
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,421
that he had opened his.
They'd open the door and they'd have to 

417
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:41,151
help him in the car.
And then you have these little mint 

418
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:44,121
candies.
He put one in his mouth and then just 

419
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,030
fucking pointed in the right direction 
and go every day.

420
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,820
Dude was like in his eighties.
Wow.

421
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,280
Probably still doing that.
Yep.

422
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,670
You know where it's going on right now,
the pch.

423
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,600
You ever go down the pch though?
The one near Malibu.

424
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,370
Always know the pch.
Pacific coast,

425
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,200
the Pacific coast highway in Malibu is a
very dangerous road.

426
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,380
Yeah.
And it's bar after bar,

427
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:08,880
after restaurant,
after bar,

428
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:10,500
after bar,
after bar after bar.

429
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,870
And then all these rich people,
right,

430
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,871
all these people that can afford beach 
houses and then people are going to 

431
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:18,510
these bars and restaurants and they're 
just driving.

432
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,340
They're driving home.
Okay.

433
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,190
Everyone's driving drunk.
There's just a ton of drunk driving.

434
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,270
The guy who did pulp fiction with 
Quentin Tarantino,

435
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,430
the other guy who was involved with it.
What is his name?

436
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,020
Roger Avery.
Is that it?

437
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,320
Who?
He also wrote killing Zoe,

438
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,840
which is indirectly that I think.
Which is a fucking awesome.

439
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah,
it's a good movie.

440
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,630
He's a.
he's supposedly a super genius guy,

441
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:45,170
right?
Roger Avery.

442
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,010
Yeah.
He apparently was involved in a horrible

443
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,520
drunk driving accident.
Well,

444
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,440
Mel Gibson,
Mel Gibson incident happened right there

445
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,900
in Malibu.
That was at a restaurant once I saw this

446
00:20:55,901 --> 00:21:00,901
guy drive off drunk.
Him and his buddies were having like a 

447
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:01,090
waterfight and was hammered.
He got into his car.

448
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,700
They were throwing water.
Each other hammered.

449
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,400
Got In his car.

450
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,710
Yeah.
I mean the valet parking attendants need

451
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:08,260
to be responsible because they can sue 
the restaurant.

452
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Yes.
But if you're a kid and you're working 

453
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,520
there from college and you see this 
fucking guy,

454
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,810
like what are you going to do?
Like he's probably some rich dude.

455
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,980
You know,
if you,

456
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,570
if you get mad at him for this,
you know,

457
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,900
who knows how the restaurant's gonna 
perceive it.

458
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:26,460
If they're going to fire,
you don't want the valleys to step in.

459
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:29,670
And some guy throwing wise sage,
most likely it's easier to like,

460
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,350
he'll be fine.
Just let them get in that car.

461
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,960
The guy's like,
that's what I would do if I was 20 years

462
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,810
old and I was working there like these 
kids are here.

463
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:40,811
I,
I wouldn't tell this 50 year old dude 

464
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:40,811
with a $10,000.
Watch on that.

465
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:42,810
He can't throw water.
He can't get in his car.

466
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:44,370
I'd be scared.
I'd be like,

467
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,540
sky like represents authority.
You know,

468
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,660
he just let him go.

469
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,930
I probably would let them go,
but I couldn't believe that will let 

470
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:53,930
them go.
You know,

471
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,310
there was a bunch of people around and 
people getting upset because him and the

472
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,520
guy with thrown water each other and 
they were almost getting people so 

473
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,700
people start getting upset,
so there was this air of tension in the 

474
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:04,920
air and then the valley came and the guy
got in his car and we were like,

475
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,120
wow,
should we stop that?

476
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,370
You know,
she'd stopped that guy from getting in a

477
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:09,100
car.
It's,

478
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,120
it's like a judgment call.
He might have just been an idiot.

479
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,000
Have you ever taken someone's case?
No.

480
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,820
I've advised people to not drink or not 
drive rather.

481
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,950
I've definitely done that,
but I have not taken any keys.

482
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,870
I haven't had to,
but I've seen some shit man.

483
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:26,360
Especially when I was young.
God,

484
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,800
Dallas

485
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,390
people drive fucked up.

486
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,070
Yeah.
My Dad,

487
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,940
I remember my mom and dad fighting about
her not wanting him to drive.

488
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:39,680
He'd be fucked up and I remember him 
driving us home one night.

489
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:44,681
My mom was screaming at him before we 
got in and then it was like a 

490
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:44,681
terrorized,
like you,

491
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:49,621
you know that painting the scream.
That's what I looked like in the side 

492
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:50,030
view mirror.
He was like going over curbs.

493
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:53,090
I was just like,
and we got home and I remember like,

494
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:54,740
uh,
he,

495
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,100
we were crying,
we were little kids and I remember 

496
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,621
crying and I remember the next day he 
came down to the TV room and he 

497
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:03,050
apologized and then he quit drinking for
like

498
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,540
maybe two months.
Wow.

499
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,980
Yeah.
Wow.

500
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,630
Wow.
Even after two months he went back.

501
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,860
Hell yeah,
he would,

502
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,890
he would quit.
He would go through that grip of that 

503
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,870
fucking alcoholic people,
native Americans,

504
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,270
you know,
right grip on them.

505
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,010
I haven't had it fully explained to me 
because I've read it both ways.

506
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,160
I've read that there was some sort of a 
genetic propensity towards alcoholism 

507
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,050
that they had because the fact that 
alcohol was not normal to them,

508
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,970
it wasn't something they had in their 
diet all the time.

509
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:40,910
So they didn't have the enzymes or 
whatever it was to break it down.

510
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,320
Well,
the liver,

511
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,810
the liver is different the way they.
I've heard.

512
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:46,120
That's how

513
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,660
real are.
Whether that's bullshit.

514
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,420
It's just cultural.
Yeah.

515
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,020
I don't know.
I don't know who's right,

516
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:51,830
it's hard,
man.

517
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,550
It's undeniable that certain cultures 
like ours,

518
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,420
like the Irish,
the Italians have a lot of alcoholism.

519
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,780
Right?
Well,

520
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:00,830
part of it is,
I mean,

521
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,920
if you think about it culturally,
Italians and Irish are both Catholics.

522
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,910
There's a lot of repression.
There's a lot of shame and um,

523
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,180
you know,
when,

524
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:14,181
when that happens,
I think people act out and I think 

525
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:14,181
they're,
you know,

526
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,470
Italians have living under fascism and 
uh,

527
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,310
and the Catholic church,
so fucking you need to,

528
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,170
you need an escape,
you know,

529
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,550
man.
So you can,

530
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,240
you could drink healthy.
I see you drink Tequila sometimes.

531
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,290
Um,
you can handle it.

532
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,520
Yeah.
I can not do it.

533
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,330
I don't,
I could not do it for long stretches of 

534
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:37,330
time.
It doesn't,

535
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:37,460
it's not something my need.

536
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,360
I enjoy it while it's happening,
but I understand the pole,

537
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,950
the biological Polish.
Some people have,

538
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:45,590
I just don't have it.
Can you get drunk sometimes?

539
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:49,500
Like real drunk.
I try not to get real drunk and the drug

540
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,430
has been in recent memories,
but on this podcast.

541
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Really?
Yeah.

542
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,430
A couple of times.
Well,

543
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,350
no,
it's Chrysler for sure in the past,

544
00:24:57,351 --> 00:25:00,320
but I did one recently with Hannibal 
Hannibal buress.

545
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,350
You've got fucking lit.
We got lit to the poor and my tongue 

546
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,231
started getting heavy.
It was hard to move around while I was 

547
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:13,130
trying to entertain award.
It was like I was doing.

548
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,170
You ever used one of those heavy jump 
ropes?

549
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,000
Like those jump out,
like this is ridiculous.

550
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,940
Like jumping rope is hard enough.
Why don't have to have this fucking ship

551
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,050
rope,
you know,

552
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,060
like the.
But they make these really heavy ones.

553
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,530
That's what my tongue felt like.
Yeah.

554
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,810
What a job.
Think about your job description.

555
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,370
Yeah,
it's pretty ridiculous.

556
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,980
Get I drank whatever.
Go for as long as you want.

557
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,840
Talk some shit.
Talk some shit.

558
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,220
So it did take a,
a,

559
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,110
a uber home?
Yes he did.

560
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,810
Yes he did.
Yeah,

561
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,180
I took one here.
Took one home.

562
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,410
He's hilarious.
He,

563
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,370
yeah,
he is funny.

564
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,610
And we went onto another podcast right 
afterwards because my friend Josh has 

565
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,260
eps came in to do his podcast from here 
with Sam Harris.

566
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,150
Sam Harrison is famed atheist slash 
neuroscientists.

567
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,900
Yeah.
And Cannibal.

568
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:56,060
And Sam Harris had like this epic 
argument.

569
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,890
Oh yeah.
Hannibal was hammered.

570
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,110
No Shit.
Oh,

571
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:02,190
I get to listen to that.
And I was amber do.

572
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:03,110
So I was trying to,
like,

573
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I was trying to chime in and,
and so the whole thing was.

574
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,020
So it was so not good.
It wasn't like my.

575
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:15,540
Even my attempts were so clumsy.
My attempts to calm,

576
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,170
calm the situation down.
So embarrassing.

577
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,010
Yeah.
At Son Josh steps.

578
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,330
Yeah.
It hasn't come out yet.

579
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,330
Okay.
Is He.

580
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,800
I don't know what he's going to do if 
he's even going to release it.

581
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,830
Scattered relates.
Well the problem is Hannibal didn't know

582
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:35,831
he was going to be drunk on a podcast 
talking to a neuroscientist about race 

583
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:35,990
issues.
Yeah.

584
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,150
You know,
race issues about cops shooting black 

585
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,800
people and Statistics see the 
statistics.

586
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,160
So I don't

587
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
know if this is accurate.
I'm just knowing what I've read and I 

588
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,160
don't know what this means,
but I'm just going to say it.

589
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,410
This statistics are like,
people would think the cops are more 

590
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,140
violently shoot more black people than 
white people,

591
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,180
like per capita or percentage or 
whatever it is.

592
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,760
Apparently it's not true,
so they.

593
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,290
They showed this,
this a study recently that shows that if

594
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,750
you look at the overall set,
let's find out what those numbers are so

595
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:11,751
we can talk about it and know exactly 
what we're saying because this was the 

596
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:14,631
argument that other white communities 
experiences many shootings from cops is 

597
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:18,741
black communities essentially damning 
towards like what I've always said is I 

598
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:19,770
think it's.
I think most people,

599
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,260
almost 99 percent of the people are 
unqualified to be a cop.

600
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,300
I think it's an unbelievably difficult 
job.

601
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,070
I think cops shoot people all the time 
and they shouldn't shoot people that are

602
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,090
dealing with 300 million plus people in 
this one continent and we're looking at 

603
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:38,301
the stories of all these cops in all of 
these cities and all of these counties 

604
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:39,870
and all these states,
all over the country.

605
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,140
You're dealing with a fucking mammoth 
amount of people.

606
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Yeah.
It's just because of the history of 

607
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,781
racism.
It's more disturbing to us to think that

608
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,400
there's white cops are targeting black 
kids,

609
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,760
which they most certainly must be there.
Most certainly must be.

610
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,560
Some of them,
if you think of the height,

611
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,590
the amount of people we're talking about
there most likely is a racist or to 

612
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,420
amongst them or or who knows how many.
Well,

613
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:09,450
there's no denying it or systemic racism
in the department.

614
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,750
Yeah,
but I feel like we're all on this 

615
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,181
heightened sense of like conflict 
because we're looking at the conflicts 

616
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:22,911
between millions of fucking people and 
we're an individual and we're taking in 

617
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,290
these numbers,
these interactions.

618
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,530
Millions.
Literally millions of people interacting

619
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:33,531
with police officers every day.
It's way too much for our fucking 

620
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:34,710
brains,
so we start thinking,

621
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:39,711
Jesus,
the cops are killing black people 

622
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:39,711
everywhere.

623
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:42,260
Well,
turns out does it just shooting people 

624
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,260
everywhere.
It's black people and white people.

625
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,630
It's just there's been some really 
damning videos of them doing it to black

626
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:50,631
people and again,
there's probably a lot of cops that are 

627
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:54,171
racist here,
but that's to see these stats because I 

628
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:54,330
haven't heard anything like that.
This is what it was.

629
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,310
Washington Post they get really.
Okay.

630
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,790
Let's,
let's look at the actual numbers.

631
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,690
Were were the actual numbers.
Okay.

632
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:06,910
Post began its police shootings project 
and response to the 2014 killing of 

633
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,340
Michael Brown in Ferguson,
Missouri,

634
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:13,341
a death that triggered days of riding,
the assassination of to New York City 

635
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:15,300
police officers and a surge of support 
for the black lives matter,

636
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:18,630
protest movement,
Blah ba Blah ba blah ba blah ba blah.

637
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:23,631
As of January 15th,
the posted documented 987 victims of 

638
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:28,581
fatal police shootings in 2015 about 
twice the number historically recorded 

639
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:33,201
by federal agencies.
Whites were 50 percent of those victims 

640
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:34,950
and blacks were 26 percent by 
comparison,

641
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:38,940
whites are 62 percent of the US 
population and blacks are 13 percent.

642
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,310
The ensuing debate is largely centered 
on whether the disproportionate

643
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,310
number of black deaths was a result of 
police racism or the relatively high 

644
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,031
rate of crime in black neighborhoods,
which brings black men into more 

645
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:52,990
frequent and more fraught encounters 
with the police.

646
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,670
So it seems to me just looking at those 
numbers right there,

647
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,760
that it says whites were 50 percent of 
those victims and blacks were 26 

648
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,110
percent.
Well,

649
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,130
that's just right away.
There's way more white people than there

650
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:12,550
are black people,
so that seems to manage you eyes.

651
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,640
The blacks are twice as likely if 
they're 13 percent of the population in 

652
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,291
26 percent of the victims,
they are double a and whites are 20 

653
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,860
percent,
so it's proportionately likely.

654
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,210
So this is in fact kind of like 
disproving what you saying,

655
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,340
right?
It's saying there is a trend,

656
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,190
but what they're saying is,
is it sociological?

657
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,130
Isn't the fact that blacks were living 
in dangerous neighborhoods?

658
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,820
The reason why there's more,
which is totally logical.

659
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,850
Yeah.
Well that's the argument that he should 

660
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:47,850
have made.
This is not the argument he made.

661
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,210
That's interesting because I didn't know
that that was what the statistics were 

662
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,210
and I wish I knew that going into that 
conversation.

663
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,270
I've obviously had no idea we going to 
have this conversation or I would've.

664
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,430
Huh.
That's interesting because that,

665
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,960
you know,
I mean you can blame it on the 

666
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,411
neighborhood.
You get blamed on crime ridden 

667
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:06,811
communities,
but if we're just going to go 

668
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:08,611
statistics,
the statistic will then then they're 

669
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:11,520
right.
More black people are getting shot by 

670
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,520
cops,
but people are getting shot by cops.

671
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,811
Like it's a lot.
There's a lot of fucking people get 50 

672
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:16,000
percent in 2015.
What is that a little about,

673
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,430
dude?
I don't know.

674
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,630
It's just terrifying.
It feels like this whole gun issue,

675
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,100
it didn't use to be an issue,
you know,

676
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:29,101
that the NRA used to be like a hunting 
organization and people just own guns 

677
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:33,550
and it wasn't a big deal and then they 
made it a political issue and now I feel

678
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:36,700
like there's almost like a gun coveting.

679
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I think there's more people that are 
dangerous that are getting guns and I 

680
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,860
think the police are probably responding
to that.

681
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,700
Well,
that could definitely be the case.

682
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,350
I mean there's a,
there's also,

683
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,620
when you look at guns and um,
this is one thing that I don't think we 

684
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,570
really consider that much.
There's a gun industry,

685
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,750
okay.
Within their manufacturing guns 

686
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,690
constantly and they're manufacturing 
them for civilians and they can use them

687
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:08,851
legally and they can own them legally 
and it's the right and people exercise 

688
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:13,681
that Second Amendment right.
And they have a lot of guns and this 

689
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,890
business keeps me guns and there's just 
a lot of guns.

690
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,520
A lot of guns was like,
at one point in time,

691
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,500
we're going to have fucking guns all 
over the place.

692
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,740
I mean the world's going to be safer 
because no one's going to be shooting 

693
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:25,740
people because everyone's going to have 
a gun.

694
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,200
Because if I think of America as many 
guns as there are people right now,

695
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:31,060
I think there's more.
Oh really?

696
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,330
I think there's more.
Yeah,

697
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,580
we'll find that out because I think it 
was one of those things where they were 

698
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:37,630
like,
the numbers switched over.

699
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,280
Yeah.
They broke up the guns of out fucked

700
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,290
us.
Now it's going to be like,

701
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:43,640
everyone's going to have the.
What is it,

702
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,830
Jamie?
Jamie.

703
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,070
It's about the same.
Roughly twice as many guns per capita as

704
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:52,040
there were in 1968.
More than 300 million guns at all.

705
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,920
So it's basically the population in one 
for one.

706
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,440
Wow.
How many of you have.

707
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,240
I've got a few.
Yeah,

708
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,510
I think about it.
You think about having one.

709
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:10,590
Well,
I feel mixed because first of all I 

710
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,770
would feel bad as to have a gun.
I'll just say that right out there.

711
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:17,130
It would,
it would feel really fucking cool to 

712
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,781
hold some steel and I'd have a safe and 
I put it in the safe and that it would 

713
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:23,681
feel good to know that if shit got 
really bad that I'd be able to go out 

714
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,820
and kill the people that have the food 
in the water.

715
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,600
Or yourself or.
Right.

716
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,180
Did you ever see that movie?
The road?

717
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,030
Now?
I didn't see it and this is why I didn't

718
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:37,490
see it because I started watching it and
early on,

719
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:39,860
spoiler alert,
early on the movie,

720
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:40,600
He was,
uh,

721
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,250
talking to his kid about how to kill 
yourself.

722
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,470
He was showing his kid how to put the 
gun in your mouth if someone's coming 

723
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,470
against you.
Really?

724
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,700
Yeah.
Who is,

725
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,530
who's The star of it?
What's that dude's name?

726
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,220
Handsome Fella rings.
No,

727
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,130
no.
To do an x files again,

728
00:33:58,131 --> 00:33:59,360
our thing.
That's real,

729
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,200
right?
Are they?

730
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,970
What's his name?
Could use the work vehicle.

731
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,880
Baal.
He's fucking great.

732
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,680
He's awesome.
I'm seeing that the road.

733
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Yeah,
I love that you have a little yellow 

734
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:11,740
legal pad,
neff,

735
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:11,740
your guests,
so they can have for a while.

736
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah,
I've already got down Josh,

737
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:16,380
a Zaps and the road.
Yeah.

738
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,300
I wish I would,
uh,

739
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,580
go over these notes.
It was probably some golden there.

740
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,330
I write shit all the time.
I write shit all the time,

741
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:25,560
like in the middle of it.
Let's go through.

742
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,570
I need to remember and it never comes up
and get in there and I can barely read 

743
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,190
my own handwriting.
It's pretty bad becoming.

744
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,760
It's becoming so that handwriting seems 
so stupid,

745
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,810
like more,
more quickly.

746
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,790
Texting is so much better.
Well,

747
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:46,791
you know,
if this schools are deciding to stop 

748
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:50,151
teaching cursive now,
which is a shame because cursive is 

749
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:51,060
much,
much faster.

750
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,920
Yeah.
But it's goofy.

751
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,670
Too many people are goofy with it.
They'll give you one of these like,

752
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:58,260
what the fuck is that?
What,

753
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,420
what?
How the hell do I know what that word 

754
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,420
is?
Barely made any movement.

755
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,540
You Lazy.
Fuck yeah.

756
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,730
You kind of keep sliding your hand as 
you're writing.

757
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:10,731
You can't leave it there.
That's why cursive ended because people 

758
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:10,731
were fucking lazy.

759
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:12,550
Lazy people would write you shit and it 
was just this,

760
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,200
this dribble of ups and downs.
You didn't.

761
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,100
Was that an end?
Is it a you like a giant signature?

762
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,840
It looks like a fucking ekg.
It's so stupid.

763
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,610
It's needs to go away.
I need to know what an.

764
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,880
Is that an we'll make it look like in a 
fuck.

765
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,040
You can't.
It can't be left to your interpretation 

766
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,040
of what an a should be.
If you make a tea,

767
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,690
cross it where the fucking t is not it.
Don't put the eye over the L.

768
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,560
is there an eye over now?
Now?

769
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,240
Like if the dots should be above the 
stem of the eye,

770
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:46,020
but there's always.
Oh,

771
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,290
so he's at the letter next to it.
Right.

772
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,440
What about like in.
Does anybody ever put the eye under the 

773
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,460
lower k over the lower case?
J.

774
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,360
Did they do that anymore?

775
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,410
It was a door.
I make that up.

776
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,000
You're supposed to put it.
I like a dot over lowercase j.

777
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:03,810
yeah,
of course.

778
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,730
Does anybody do that?
I do.

779
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,070
Fuck you.
Writing something by hand.

780
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,700
You'd put a dot over the lowercase j.
absolutely.

781
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,960
I mean it's barely knew you were 
supposed to do it.

782
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:17,340
Yes.
Like I had to ask.

783
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,340
I was questioning it.
I knew it.

784
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm pretty sure that's how it would.
But I'm like,

785
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,340
who does that?
Yeah,

786
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,230
he got a deal it.
Whoa,

787
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,310
you're a stickler for that.
I just feel like maybe because I grew up

788
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,740
Catholic and penmanship was actually a 
big deal.

789
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Well,
you're actually very serious and they 

790
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,120
might not even know you're an emmy award
winning writer.

791
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,000
That's right.
And that's how they give out the emmys.

792
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,350
They look at your penmanship.
Well,

793
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,480
they go all writer.
Right?

794
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,320
You know what I'm saying?

795
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:48,350
Yeah.
You've got to know how to put that out 

796
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,460
there.
It's so weird when you look at Russian,

797
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,410
if you look at any,
uh,

798
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,500
like I follow a lot of Russian athletes.
I follow their instagram pages and I 

799
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:56,500
looked at the rug,
Mars.

800
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,880
Now that might as well be from Mars.
What's up with all these fake letters?

801
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,970
You guys go like this jumble of how did 
this happen?

802
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:08,370
Is so shitty at communicating that we 
let all these different styles of 

803
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,400
language exist to the point where none 
of us can.

804
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,590
It's like the Tower of Babel.
What you.

805
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,430
We will have one language.
That's a good question man.

806
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Look at all the weird shit they have 
like that boomerang above the backwards 

807
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,620
in like what the fight is going on up 
there.

808
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,890
And how about the other one that looks 
like a red dragons.

809
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,100
Like the Jason Ellis logo.
That's something there.

810
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,770
They have like a regular a and a regular
pig.

811
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:40,490
Well,
what the fuck?

812
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Can we agree that these data from the 
past that was in the middle on the 

813
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:45,500
right.
Oh,

814
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,170
that's a vagina.
Vagina.

815
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,700
That's a very excited,
puffy one.

816
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,440
Yeah,
that's it.

817
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,360
That's a 16 year old girl.
Hey.

818
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:51,970
No,
no,

819
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:52,320
no,
no.

820
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:56,640
It's a 19 year old girl who's 19 and 
grew up in Europe.

821
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,700
They have a different attitude and they 
clearly shave.

822
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Yeah.
I mean how much more could have been 

823
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,200
done a long time ago if we all spoke one
language,

824
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,490
the Tower of Babel Shit.
Although obviously it's great.

825
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:10,680
What's the Tower of Babel story from the
Bible?

826
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,900
Didn't rate it.
How dare you?

827
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,430
I know what I'm talking about.
A Catholic.

828
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,770
I am.
I was a Catholic for a year.

829
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,090
Um,
to the Tower of Babel is the whole thing

830
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:26,091
about it was that there's all these 
different languages and that there was 

831
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:29,181
some,
let's go to the actual official 

832
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:29,190
definition because I'm going to fuck it 
up,

833
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,580
but that one of the ways to keep us from
understanding each other was to give us 

834
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,380
so many different languages.
We couldn't communicate with each other.

835
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:35,800
Right?

836
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,430
What does this,
what's the myth?

837
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,720
Find out where the meth is here.
Young tram according to the story,

838
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,780
a united humanity.
There it is a united humanity for the 

839
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,070
generations following the great floods,
speaking in a single language and 

840
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,340
migrating from the east came to the 
land.

841
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,930
Uh,
is it going further?

842
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Okay.
Team two came to the land of Shinara 

843
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,790
Shin.
She say that Shannara Shannara there,

844
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:09,650
they agreed to build a city and a tower 
tall enough to reach heaven.

845
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:12,920
Seeing this God confounded their speech

846
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,000
so that they could no longer understand 
each other and scattered them around the

847
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:20,670
world.
So that's the idea of.

848
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:23,560
Well,
I mean it's basically an acknowledgement

849
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,250
of how much could be accomplished if we 
could all speak the same language,

850
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,400
but we're all still like,
this is my culture man.

851
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,710
Like this is my culture.
This is who I'm,

852
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,870
you know,
I'm not abandoning this.

853
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:40,470
We all have this sense of.
It's kind of clannish like Flemish 

854
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,220
[inaudible].
It's like this.

855
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,280
What is that?
A hollins?

856
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:45,630
Well,
the,

857
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,700
the,
the Netherlands than Flemish Dutch speak

858
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,050
Dutch.
The Dutch people speak Flemish.

859
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,730
Oh.
Then they live in the Netherlands,

860
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,220
which is also called Holland with the 
fuck is a lot of different names.

861
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,540
Yeah.
Flemish.

862
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,010
Yep.
Gregory's correct.

863
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:08,011
The Dutch language spoken in Flanders,
one of the two official languages of 

864
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,130
Belgium.
Huh?

865
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:14,370
The people flenders and you know,
they have to speak three languages 

866
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,940
because they got England next to them.
They get France next to them.

867
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,890
They get what?
Hold on,

868
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,210
Jeremy.
That was confusing.

869
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:24,510
It says it's spoken in Flanders,
one of the two official languages of 

870
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,690
Belgium,
but that's Belgium is not Holland.

871
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,500
So what the fuck did we screw it up?
I think we screwed it up.

872
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,490
Or the Dutch.

873
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,600
It says it's a variety of Dutch.
Okay.

874
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:40,601
Here's another one.
Flemish also called Flemish Dutch 

875
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:43,540
Belgium dust and slash or southern Dutch
refers to the varieties of the Dutch 

876
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:47,420
language spoken in Flanders,
the northern part of Belgium.

877
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:50,510
The turn.
Flemish is used at least five ways.

878
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,250
It seems like it's all in Belgium,
man.

879
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,250
Yeah.
So what do people in Holland speak?

880
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,810
I think they speak Dutch people in 
Holland that probably so mad at us now.

881
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,230
And fucking idiots.
We have to watch your stupid elections.

882
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,850
You don't even know what language we 
speak.

883
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:12,370
The whole world knows that Donald Trump 
and Hillary Clinton are claw each 

884
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,170
other's eyes out to become the president
and we don't know their language.

885
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,230
They speak,
they speak Dutch.

886
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:22,470
And why does that one Frisians for CN 
poppy?

887
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:24,900
A meadow puppy.
A mento?

888
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,050
Yeah.
They,

889
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:27,810
uh,
Lebanon,

890
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:31,640
South Africa and they speak Dutch there 
and they've,

891
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:31,860
uh,

892
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,700
yeah,
they,

893
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,160
they fucked up South Africa,
man.

894
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,100
They came in hard.
Such,

895
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,170
it's so weird.
It's so weird when you look at like the 

896
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,370
pockets of white people,
like when apartheid was kicking.

897
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,430
Yeah.
Like you look at how bizarre that 

898
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,531
must've been like these white racist 
people living in South Africa surrounded

899
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:58,250
by black people and they came over on 
boats essentially.

900
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:03,230
They're like the last of one of those 
colony expansion experiments.

901
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,850
Yeah.
They went to Africa,

902
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,890
right?
The British had already been there.

903
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,280
I think the French might've been there,
but the Dutch were the ones that came in

904
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:13,490
and just fucking dude,
turn the screws.

905
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,770
Imagine if there was an Africa to 
Africa,

906
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,150
you know,
we look,

907
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,560
we look at Africa,
right?

908
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:19,760
And we go,
wow.

909
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,250
Like that's where civilization began.
Look,

910
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:27,251
there's fucking lions and people are the
Mussai warriors and running around with 

911
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:31,391
spears have to kill a lion to be a man.
They're all dancing around the fire and 

912
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,140
Tanzania and you're like,
wow,

913
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,580
this is a window to a totally different 
world like Africa itself.

914
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,860
What if there was a place even fucking 
crazy?

915
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:47,020
You pass Africa,
the Africans went to the dark lands and 

916
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,230
there's just monsters tearing each other
apart,

917
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:53,231
left and right.
Nothing survived more than a few 

918
00:42:53,231 --> 00:42:55,391
minutes.
Everything's just fucking and killing 

919
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:56,840
and it's just chaos and blaming bends in
half,

920
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:01,870
eating their babies as they come out of 
the womb and bandits dressed like like 

921
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,770
human dumpsters with machine guns 
running around,

922
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,800
blowing each other up.
It was every things bulletproof and on 

923
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:14,100
fire and then Africa is like,
I can go over to fucking cozy.

924
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,930
Right,
right.

925
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,450
Those people are looking at the Africans
and going like,

926
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,710
wow.
Wow.

927
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:19,190
They,
they,

928
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,490
they do castrations with swords.
That's actually kind of Nice.

929
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,960
Better than the rock we're using.
Yeah.

930
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,720
There's this one episode of this show 
that I watched called Jim shockey's 

931
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,681
uncharted.
He's this guy who goes to all these 

932
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:36,640
different parts of the world and he's a 
professional hunter and he goes to these

933
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:41,641
places and sometimes they eradicate like
dangerous animals that are threatening 

934
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:41,641
villages.
Yeah,

935
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,780
and one of the episodes he went to this 
village,

936
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,560
I don't remember what part of the.
Of the Congo it was,

937
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,860
but they have these giant saltwater 
crocodiles at eight people all the time 

938
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:58,100
and while they were there willing got a 
no shit while they were there filming 

939
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,040
should they took her away?
They took her out into the man number 

940
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,460
one cause of death in Africa.
Let's rock it out.

941
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,980
I thought it was hippos.
Maybe you're right.

942
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:07,270
And I was making it up.
Anyway.

943
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,390
I think on this episode your listeners 
should fact check like Flemish.

944
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,110
Yeah.
Number one,

945
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:16,390
cause of death in Africa.
Get back to me about.

946
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,630
And then the police.
We were wrong about the statistics of 

947
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:21,700
police violence too,
right?

948
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,210
Yeah.
The,

949
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:24,100
um,
the,

950
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,470
the alligator crocodile things,
especially crocodiles.

951
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,680
Crocodiles are way,
way more,

952
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,770
way more aggressive in their bigger.
Some of them are.

953
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,840
There's the American crocodiles are 
actually smaller than the American 

954
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,380
alligators.
American crocodiles are super aggressive

955
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:38,940
though.
Their dog eaters.

956
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,410
Is that Florida?
Yeah.

957
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,940
Yeah.
There's a small population.

958
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:46,110
It's protected because we don't have 
enough monsters and we liked him to keep

959
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:51,060
fucking because some of them you don't 
understand the ecosystem.

960
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:52,260
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

961
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:53,130
Folks.
Relax.

962
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,950
I'm not,
I'm not anti crocodile,

963
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,390
but it is,
it's Kinda weird.

964
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,450
It's weird kind of.
Where do we want to keep those monsters 

965
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:02,450
around?
I mean,

966
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:02,600
it's a shame because when you see what's
happening to sharks,

967
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,590
they kill.
I forget the numbers.

968
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:07,230
It's something like 3 million sharks a 
year.

969
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,010
Yes,
they do.

970
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:13,011
Right,
and it's like that's fucking crate and 

971
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:16,481
they're harmless animals to us.
Dislike for deaths a year in the world 

972
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:21,351
from shark by.
Why am I putting all these statistics 

973
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:21,351
out?
I don't think there's,

974
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,380
I think,
I don't think you're far off though.

975
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,330
Yeah,
I think we found out once,

976
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,680
but I don't remember what the number 
was.

977
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,530
It was less than 25 people die every 
year from sharks,

978
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:28,800
right?

979
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,940
Oh yeah.

980
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,440
Okay.
I caught up looking at a buffalo,

981
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,470
supposedly reportedly kill as many 
people in Africa is hippos and 

982
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:37,980
crocodiles.
Oh,

983
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:39,480
for sure.
Buffalo,

984
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,250
Cape Buffalo here.

985
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,480
That's huge.
Cape Buffalo Funding Shark thing.

986
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,850
They call them the black death.
Yeah.

987
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,550
Do.
They're terrifying ne running herds.

988
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:49,870
We'll look at,
look at what that looks like.

989
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:51,230
Scroll up a little bit.
Their drummer.

990
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,720
Yeah.
Fucking thing.

991
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,380
And they're super aggressive because 
they're fighting off lines all the time,

992
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:57,130
man.
Yeah.

993
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,120
The widow maker,
credible documentary called relentless 

994
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,681
enemies and it's about this one 
particular pride of lions that lives on 

995
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:14,011
an island in Africa where the rivers 
changed its course and it's,

996
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:20,110
it's stranded these islands from the 
rest of the rest of Africa.

997
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,680
These lions can't get out of this island
and all they have to eat on this island 

998
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,360
are these giant fucking buffalo's.
Wow.

999
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:33,390
So the lines themselves have grown huge 
and they become supersized lions were 

1000
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:37,090
females like an adult female of one of 
these tribes.

1001
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,610
There's one particular tribe where 
they're enormous.

1002
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:44,611
They look like the hulk,
like they don't even look like real 

1003
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:46,921
lions where the adult females are as 
large as a regular adult male.

1004
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,180
Other prides.
Yeah.

1005
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,900
And so see if you find that relentless 
enemy's line photos,

1006
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,140
it's a fucking incredible documentary 
because it just shows you like,

1007
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,600
nature's going to find a way like,
oh,

1008
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:03,601
all we can eat is buffalo.
Looks like we're going to have to get a 

1009
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:03,601
little bigger boys.
And they just got bigger.

1010
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,130
Like the cats,
the bigger cat stayed alive.

1011
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,370
The bigger cats figured out how to do it
and when they go after them,

1012
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,580
look at the size of that thing that's a 
female yet,

1013
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,830
and then they're taken out these giant 
buffaloes.

1014
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,400
Yeah.
Sharp ass horns.

1015
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,010
See if you get some photos of the 
individual lions like you get.

1016
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,140
Well there's a good good photo of it,
but just look up relentless.

1017
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,100
Oh,
and then this was okay.

1018
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,940
Yeah,
just a lions there.

1019
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,430
Well,
it's,

1020
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,820
there's some photos of a more.
They're in motion where you got to kind 

1021
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,520
of get a sense of the real mass that 
they have,

1022
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:47,790
but just saw one of those buffaloes 
chase off a crocodile who is eating like

1023
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:52,220
another species of animal.
Wow.

1024
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:53,990
I don't believe that

1025
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,360
buffaloes are enormous animals.
When you're talking about something 

1026
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,710
that's like 2000 plus pounds often.
I wonder what like the,

1027
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,930
the biggest of the males grows too.

1028
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,680
Have you been on safari?
No.

1029
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,390
Real APP.
Surprised.

1030
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,190
Scared.
Tom.

1031
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,610
Tom.
Papa was just here.

1032
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:15,780
He just got back.
Oh yeah.

1033
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,330
I just don't want to give my kids 
malaria medication.

1034
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,640
Right.
It's too young.

1035
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,700
It's just too fucked up to require that.
And you gotta take it while you're over 

1036
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,480
there and it's just,
it's just a day,

1037
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:26,970
right?
Yeah.

1038
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:31,971
And then you've got to get a typhoid 
shot and there's a lot on the go during 

1039
00:48:31,971 --> 00:48:32,820
their winter.
Do you don't do it then?

1040
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,740
Really the,
I went over there twice,

1041
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:36,960
but both times it was their winter,
which is our summer.

1042
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,090
And it was.
You don't need malaria.

1043
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,980
No kidding.
So you didn't do anything?

1044
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:41,880
Nope.
Wow.

1045
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:43,140
So you have malaria?
Yep.

1046
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Okay.
Don't you see how small my look at the 

1047
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,121
head funds are practically touching that
Zika stuff,

1048
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:57,831
man.
Well the big danger now is not the 

1049
00:48:57,831 --> 00:49:00,501
mosquitoes.
It's that it's a sexually transmitted 

1050
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:02,880
disease and they say it's infection rate
is about the same as aids was.

1051
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,350
Oh really?
Yeah.

1052
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,060
Wow.
Well there's areas in Miami now where 

1053
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,090
they're thinking about like cordoning 
off blocks and shit.

1054
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,040
Right?
Why?

1055
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,290
Because they saw mosquitoes there.
Yeah.

1056
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:18,770
Because they,
they've so many cases of Zika.

1057
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,670
Damn Dude,
it's growler too because they don't have

1058
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,100
a vaccine and they say they're years 
away from a vaccine.

1059
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:32,750
So this one day there's gonna be some 
insurmountable biological threat to 

1060
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:37,651
people.
No one day is going to be some some dark

1061
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:42,991
wave that sweeps across the population 
and then there's going to be a 

1062
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:43,170
rebuilding process.
Right?

1063
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,740
It's just happened so many times with so
many different things too,

1064
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:52,741
like it doesn't necessarily have.
And this is not something to freak out 

1065
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:52,741
about,
but just to put it in perspective,

1066
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:57,570
there's been so many fucking times where
something's happened,

1067
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:03,330
whether it's some gigantic event,
like a super volcano or diseases or just

1068
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,310
giant chunks of the population just 
died.

1069
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,180
Yeah,
yeah.

1070
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,200
I mean there's theories about it that 
there's population control stuff that's 

1071
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,850
built in and it can manifest itself as 
disease,

1072
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:23,330
natural disasters or war,
but the population is kept in check.

1073
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Yeah.
I guess it just,

1074
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,070
that's just the system that

1075
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:33,070
nature runs on.
It just finds a way to exploit any 

1076
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,070
weakness.
If the numbers get too high,

1077
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,390
there's more weaknesses.
Nature finds a way,

1078
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,880
develops a strong attack,
and it gets in there.

1079
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,360
It's like this little fucking Ping Pong 
match game that's going on.

1080
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:45,450
Constantly adjustments and then there's 
medicine.

1081
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,350
A bunch of scientists are fucking shake 
in test tubes.

1082
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,500
Find the disease all the time.
God Damn.

1083
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,360
I mean that's pressure.

1084
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,940
That's a long day.
I mean you think about people that work 

1085
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,101
long hours when you're a scientist 
that's trying to break the code on a 

1086
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:01,740
fucking vaccine.
Could be,

1087
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:07,130
you know,
like we would like with Ebola when they 

1088
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:07,130
were trying to figure something out.

1089
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:07,300
Yeah.
What happened to a bola?

1090
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,880
We got it.
We got it.

1091
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,600
Yeah,
we got it.

1092
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:15,601
Like,
like the got Kadafi giving that to me.

1093
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,610
I could have got the Kadafi video is 
maybe the most disturbing video ever.

1094
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,770
Oh no shit.
You've ever seen it now?

1095
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,440
Oh,
do your military are in for a treat?

1096
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:31,360
Military released it.
You're in for a treat.

1097
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:32,470
Oh,
cell phone.

1098
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,230
Video got released immediately.
This is what happened.

1099
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:40,350
They,
the rebels overcame and the United 

1100
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:40,350
States backed rebels'.
Right.

1101
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,580
I don't know the full history of how it 
went down.

1102
00:51:42,581 --> 00:51:45,990
Do you know the full history?
I know that at one point we were a happy

1103
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:47,230
back Kadafi.
Yes.

1104
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:52,410
So they have Gadhafi this is him dead.
But there's video of him where they have

1105
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:55,510
them and they're yelling,
allow,

1106
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:56,830
walk by,
I'll walk out.

1107
00:51:56,831 --> 00:52:00,670
And they've got it was that him and the 
rebels all have them and they're beating

1108
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:05,230
the fuck out of them and they start 
sticking things up his ass like swords.

1109
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,260
They stick swords up his ass and they're
stabbing them there and see other 

1110
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,340
stabbed.
I mean they just showed a murder on TV 

1111
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,230
right there.
Yeah,

1112
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,230
I mean back that up with that guy.
That guy is.

1113
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,240
He was a bad.
It seems like that guy stabbing him 

1114
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,240
while he's there.

1115
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,600
Yeah.
That was a good game of thrones killing.

1116
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,660
I remember it was Antosz point.
Oh,

1117
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,110
at one point because they were.
They made like a little bit about Kadafi

1118
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:28,230
and people and I was like a guy shoving 
a knife up his ass.

1119
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,590
Yes.
That's the video.

1120
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:31,970
So this doesn't really look where the 
guy stabbing him in that picture.

1121
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:36,971
And now that I looked at it again,
it looks like he's like slamming his 

1122
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:38,350
fist down on him.
Wow.

1123
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,040
It's really grainy cell phone footage.
Yeah.

1124
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,670
Well this is the one where they finally 
captured them.

1125
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:51,671
And they're,
they're holding up their cameras and 

1126
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:54,401
this is all like captured live.
I mean they have him when they have him 

1127
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:56,440
in there and he's freaking the fuck out 
there,

1128
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,100
pulling his hair and beating the shit 
out of him.

1129
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,470
Kicking him.
And then when he gets up,

1130
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,550
someone sticks a sword like one of those
wastes swords,

1131
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,740
little short swords.
Like right up his ass.

1132
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,540
I guess it's a knife.
Big Knife.

1133
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,630
Is that what it was?
I don't remember.

1134
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,540
I remember thinking,
is that a stick or is that a a knife.

1135
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:15,350
And then someone said it to them.

1136
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,980
Could've put.
It's amazing.

1137
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:21,981
You get these guys guys like Mugabi or 
Kadafi and they do so much cruelty and 

1138
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:26,391
they come off as so tough.
And then he seemed like this and they 

1139
00:53:26,391 --> 00:53:26,391
whimper and,
and bag

1140
00:53:26,391 --> 00:53:27,540
like little bitches.
You know,

1141
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,640
this is really embarrassing if you think
about that,

1142
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:34,641
right?
Like look at this guy and this guy was 

1143
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:34,641
a,
a,

1144
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:38,450
a huge dictator that ran his country for
a long time and killed a lot of people 

1145
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,820
that this is how it ends for them is 
actually kind of fitting.

1146
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,680
Right.
It's great,

1147
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,890
I mean it happened with a Saddam 
Hussein,

1148
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,500
you know,
what is that hiding in a little cave?

1149
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,460
It's fitting,
right,

1150
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:57,150
but his neck fucked up.
It's fucked up that we liked that.

1151
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,580
This appeals to us like that.

1152
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,600
Look,
if they captured him the way they 

1153
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,161
captured Noriega or the way they 
captured anybody else and they brought 

1154
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:07,250
them to trial in America and then put 
them in prison,

1155
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,030
which feel any better then him being 
done to death.

1156
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,420
Do you feel better watching this?
Like where they just locking them up?

1157
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,620
Yeah,
really?

1158
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,870
Yeah,
I do because,

1159
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:20,400
and I don't believe in the death 
penalty,

1160
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:23,880
but in terms of how do I feel like 
consciously,

1161
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:26,280
I don't believe in the death penalty 
because I think it's flawed.

1162
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:29,310
I think the system that would execute 
somebody isn't perfect.

1163
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,060
Yeah,
I agree.

1164
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,040
But in a case like this where,
you know,

1165
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,230
yeah,
I think that if he's being killed by the

1166
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:39,231
people that he's been subjugating,
there's something very poetic about 

1167
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:42,621
that.
I think there's a real problem with 

1168
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:42,621
cases,

1169
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:47,060
you know,
whether it's a murder case or whether 

1170
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,060
it's,
uh,

1171
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,060
any,
any kind of a case,

1172
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,230
even like armed robbery,
a lot of,

1173
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,160
there's,

1174
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,950
there's a real problem when people are 
competing against each other.

1175
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:55,830
That's what I'm trying to get to.
When you have like a defense team that's

1176
00:54:55,831 --> 00:55:00,270
competing against prosecution team and 
they're trying to win and you know,

1177
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,280
you see it all the time in business 
where things are inflated and there's 

1178
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,450
these crazy arguments get made.
What are they trying to do?

1179
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:08,100
They trying to build up their side.
They're just not,

1180
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,890
not try to be as objective,
as objective as possible.

1181
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,230
Trying to go into it and say,
well,

1182
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:18,231
you know,
as cops we probably could have done a 

1183
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,851
little bit better.
We probably could have been friendly as 

1184
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:20,670
we walked up to him and maybe they 
wouldn't have gotten defensive and maybe

1185
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:23,840
we could have shaken hands and go on 
about our day in our lives and our paths

1186
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:25,260
would have gone a different way.
But Hey,

1187
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:26,370
hindsight's 20 slash 20

1188
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,900
learning experience.
Exactly.

1189
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:30,030
Learning experience.
You want

1190
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,290
you don't.
You don't ever hear that.

1191
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,590
It's always like one hard line.
I approach a suspect.

1192
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:37,930
He was moving in a very dangerous 
manner.

1193
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,810
I saw the suspect reaching his pants.
I told him not to.

1194
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:42,970
He did it again.
I at this point,

1195
00:55:42,971 --> 00:55:44,650
I took the safety off my weapon

1196
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:50,580
discharge 32 times and you watched the 
video and that's not what happened at 

1197
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,010
all.
Like someone who has cell phone on it.

1198
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,200
Right.
That's not what happened.

1199
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,210
That's true.
It's a weird system.

1200
00:55:55,211 --> 00:55:58,180
It's completely.
It's just conflict.

1201
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,280
You know the,
the prosecutor,

1202
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:03,580
your job guys are proud of the fact that
like,

1203
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:06,790
I don't know if you saw that I'm making 
of a murderer.

1204
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,390
I saw some of it,
but the price water,

1205
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:12,130
we'll get too involved in this.
I watched two episodes and I was like,

1206
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:17,131
this is just to.
I don't want to get involved in these 

1207
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:17,860
people's ridiculous lives,
but he was proud of how many convictions

1208
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:22,861
he'd he'd had like it was.
He was like undefeated or something in 

1209
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:23,980
the county,
so not rotten.

1210
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,090
I don't smell anything right there.
And the guys in Texas that put people to

1211
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:33,091
the death penalty and that's like 
they're at a bar that night having a 

1212
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:36,451
champagne,
celebrating that he won his case and he 

1213
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:38,690
said,
the God of the Gas Chamber Day

1214
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,340
put down,
put down to do.

1215
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,470
That's what they were called it.
We'd put down.

1216
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,050
He puts down one of the bag we put down 
today.

1217
00:56:46,051 --> 00:56:47,940
Everybody knuckles up,
locals,

1218
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:48,930
locals,
all around.

1219
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:50,100
We put down today,
boy,

1220
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:53,130
we've got a good one.
Good one for the good guys.

1221
00:56:53,131 --> 00:56:53,910
Clink,
clink,

1222
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,570
budweisers and get sloshed.
Show for work foggy.

1223
00:56:57,571 --> 00:57:00,750
I'd do it again.
Put a notch in their Oxford loafers.

1224
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:05,930
Well,
I mean they are dealing with a lot of 

1225
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:05,930
scumbags and pieces of shit and a lot of
ways.

1226
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:06,660
Yeah,
but no.

1227
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Back to your point.
Their goal is not to discern the truth 

1228
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,830
and eliminate what could be done better.
It's just to kill this guy.

1229
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,050
Yeah.

1230
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:20,160
Cops don't plant evidence and try to 
frame people because they're infallible 

1231
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:23,080
and awesome.
And that's just the right thing to do.

1232
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:23,580
No,
they're.

1233
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:28,581
They're.
They're doing what a dirty accountant 

1234
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:28,581
does.
You know,

1235
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:30,220
they're doing what a joke thief does.
They're doing what a,

1236
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:33,440
a guy who steals in a lot of ways now.
I love that.

1237
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:35,320
You know what I mean?
Did you like when a,

1238
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:40,350
when a guy steals a song,
one of the rhythms beats when they sue 

1239
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:42,250
people for that shit.
Yeah.

1240
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,640
I don't know how I connected all those 
together.

1241
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:47,260
I really had a point until you started 
laughing.

1242
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,250
I started it suck.
It's something,

1243
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,280
you know,
and they,

1244
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:55,300
they,
they suck at,

1245
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,410
uh,
you know,

1246
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:01,150
the gigantic responsibility that comes 
with being a police officer.

1247
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,290
Yeah,
there's not,

1248
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,760
they're not really qualified for that.

1249
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,510
It's a politician.
Each one is a politician.

1250
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:09,930
They're supposed to be on the ground 
interacting with people,

1251
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:12,240
making connections,
getting people to trust them,

1252
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,180
getting people to follow their lead.
You know,

1253
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:20,181
like you read,
I read about this one lapd guy and he 

1254
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:22,821
started a football team and it was a 
police football team and nobody would 

1255
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:28,401
join because the community was so 
opposed to the cops that literally they 

1256
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,360
were like,
we got uniforms,

1257
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:31,650
we got helmets,
we got fields,

1258
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:33,690
we get coaches.
We want to have a team.

1259
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:35,490
You guys can play against other city 
teams.

1260
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:39,060
Nobody.
And then this one guy started,

1261
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:44,061
he was a former player cop now and he 
reached out and slowly got one kid,

1262
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:47,370
two kids finally get up to 11 kids,
started training him,

1263
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,140
got to know the parents,
the other,

1264
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,820
the other cops were helping out 
training,

1265
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,870
got to know the parents and it opened up
this whole community.

1266
00:58:54,871 --> 00:58:58,200
It changed the caves in south central.
Somewhere in the whole neighborhood is,

1267
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,330
has a great relationship with the cops 
now.

1268
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,730
Wow.
Yeah.

1269
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,560
Yeah.
It can be done right?

1270
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,830
It can be done.
This just got to be away.

1271
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,410
If you,
if you look at the overall picture,

1272
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:14,411
it's got to be a way to do it better 
than they're doing it right now across 

1273
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:17,921
the board.
Everything was like managing 

1274
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:17,921
communities.
Like it just,

1275
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,360
it just seems like there's so much room 
for improvement.

1276
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,220
Yeah.
You know,

1277
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:27,080
Obama just released 111 prisoners and I 
think that the message that he's sending

1278
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:32,081
is like,
we got to get over this police state 

1279
00:59:32,081 --> 00:59:32,081
mentality

1280
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,380
release.
One guy that,

1281
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:38,390
uh,
had retweeted a petition to release him 

1282
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,390
like a year ago.
Yeah.

1283
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:39,260
Yeah.
He was,

1284
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:42,320
um,
in jail for life,

1285
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,640
for selling lsd.

1286
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,210
How would a grateful dead concert?
Yeah.

1287
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:49,440
I ran and Obama exonerated him.
He's never should've gone to jail in the

1288
00:59:49,441 --> 00:59:49,890
first.
Well,

1289
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:52,350
it was his third strike.
That's why I went.

1290
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:54,180
But they got to get rid of that third 
strike thing.

1291
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:59,270
Yes.
And also when you do as much acid as 

1292
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,551
that guy does,
he think he remembers those first two 

1293
01:00:01,551 --> 01:00:03,351
strikes I made up.
That three strikes thing is crazy.

1294
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,090
It's so crazy.
I'm not for,

1295
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:16,020
you know,
encouraging people to continue fucking 

1296
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,020
up.
But the thing that,

1297
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,130
the only way,
like if someone does three petty crimes,

1298
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:21,160
I mean how many,
how bad is the crime after be?

1299
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:24,490
Does it have to be a violent crime 
before your three?

1300
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:29,790
I'm not sure.
That doesn't make sense with the 

1301
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:31,681
grateful dead thing.
Unless somehow know that they think of 

1302
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:33,811
selling drugs,
they find some sneaky way to categorize 

1303
01:00:33,811 --> 01:00:33,811
that as violence.

1304
01:00:33,811 --> 01:00:34,550
Yeah.
Maybe if it's a,

1305
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,460
what do they call it?
Level one drug or assets.

1306
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:39,020
Probably like the highest level of 
drugs,

1307
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:41,930
so maybe that's a felony,
whereas pot would be a misdemeanor.

1308
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,400
Hmm.
Yeah.

1309
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:44,870
Right.
I would wonder.

1310
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,720
It doesn't sound like the other charges 
were violent.

1311
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,330
I think all three were drug related.

1312
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:55,560
Listen,
the thing about acid that you can get a 

1313
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,880
whole lot of it in a very small,
like packaged.

1314
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:00,350
Sure.
Like you can get a whole lot of hits and

1315
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,890
you can carry it on you.
It's like books of stamps.

1316
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,920
Yeah.
And that's a lot of people are getting 

1317
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,080
fucked up off that.
Yeah.

1318
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,030
So I think that's problematic to people.
I think to get super nervous about that.

1319
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:18,300
Mckenna had some speech he did about 
that once about how someone in a regular

1320
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:23,761
apartment with a bathtub can make enough
acid to get a million people blasted.

1321
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,590
No Shit.
Wow.

1322
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,980
Think of the quality control there.
One guy's getting triple the amount of 

1323
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,020
another guy.

1324
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,590
This is another great analogy that 
someone said or wish I remember who,

1325
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:41,620
but they said that acid,
like in the molecule form the molecular 

1326
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,300
form,
it's,

1327
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:47,330
it's so potent.
It is literally like watching an ant 

1328
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,430
dissolve,
the empire state building,

1329
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:55,110
like something as small as an aunt or 
build or dissolve or take like you're 

1330
01:01:55,521 --> 01:02:00,521
talking about.
I should probably know if it's built to 

1331
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:00,521
dissolve,
right?

1332
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:03,680
Thing might be built,
but the idea being that there's so much 

1333
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,480
power in such a small molecule,
it's such a small,

1334
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:08,120
amazing that you need the tiniest dose.
Like a blip.

1335
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:13,210
Yeah,
and you're fucking crazy.

1336
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,150
I talked to a dude who did 25 hits of 
acid in one setting.

1337
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,010
No Shit.
Fuck them up.

1338
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:23,460
I don't know.
I don't know what he was like before 

1339
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,460
then.

1340
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,460
Yeah,
seemed okay.

1341
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,610
I knew a couple of guys.
It changed.

1342
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,780
Changed.
Yeah.

1343
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,630
Just lost their edge man.
You know,

1344
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:30,480
just had that kind of slightly vacant 
stare all the time.

1345
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,700
That's why I never took acid.
I've taken everything,

1346
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:37,701
but I've never taken acid.
It definitely seems like it has a 

1347
01:02:37,701 --> 01:02:39,720
potential to do that and I think some 
people just go super deep man.

1348
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,090
Right.
What is this?

1349
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:43,620
Oh,
okay.

1350
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:48,621
Here it is.
I'm following algae on a molecular 

1351
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:50,580
level.
The power of LSD is equivalent to a fire

1352
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:55,581
ant that can completely tear down the 
empire state building and under 30 

1353
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:55,581
minutes.
Yeah,

1354
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,570
so that's what it was.
I was the first time.

1355
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,570
Jesus.
How crazy is that?

1356
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:05,010
A fire ant that could take down the 
empire state building in 30 minutes.

1357
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,980
What is it?
How do they make it?

1358
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,950
Just a really good question and I don't 
know the answer to that.

1359
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:15,420
I know who figured it out and you know 
the story of Albert Hoffman.

1360
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:20,450
The guy was a creating.
I think he was trying to come up with a 

1361
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,220
women's fertility drug.
I believe that was the original thing.

1362
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,200
I think so if I remember correctly and 
that's where it came from,

1363
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:30,180
but then they used it for all different 
kinds of successfully on his hands.

1364
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,260
Like,
dude,

1365
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:34,290
he was the Guinea pig.
He got on his hands in the lab.

1366
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,610
He didn't know what the fuck he was 
touching.

1367
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,980
Yeah,
Guy knew his skin through his hands.

1368
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:43,670
Pretty sure that's the story.
And he went riding home on his bike 

1369
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:44,940
tour,
happen his balls off,

1370
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,300
thinking about the world in a whole new 
way of looking at life in a whole 

1371
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,110
different way and going,
wow,

1372
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:54,810
that's where I asked her,
was born.

1373
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,960
And then he went back to it and he did a
bunch of different experience 

1374
01:03:59,960 --> 01:03:59,960
experiments with it.

1375
01:03:59,960 --> 01:03:59,960
Oh yeah.
I mean Ucla,

1376
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,010
Columbia University,
like some that didn't go.

1377
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:03,240
So good.
Berkeley.

1378
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,680
Yeah.
Well,

1379
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,630
yeah.
But I think some of those were staged by

1380
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:11,631
the government.
Do you know who was involved in one of 

1381
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:11,631
the,
uh,

1382
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:12,570
Harvard asset studies?
Harvard?

1383
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,000
Yeah.
A Timothy leary.

1384
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,530
Ted Kaczynski.
No Shit.

1385
01:04:17,531 --> 01:04:18,580
Yeah.
Wow.

1386
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,290
Ted Kaczynski was a part of one of those
assets studies.

1387
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:27,380
They blew that guy's Bahrainis out.
And then he went to Berkeley and worked 

1388
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:32,421
as a professor for a short period of 
time just to get enough money to 

1389
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:36,381
implement his manifesto to move into 
that cabin in the woods and start 

1390
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:37,570
killing people who are creating 
technology now.

1391
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,510
He Won.
He lost his fucking mind.

1392
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,280
He really did.
I mean,

1393
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:43,110
he might've been crazy before that.
Who knows.

1394
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,260
But you know the story about the 
unibomber that his brother recognize the

1395
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,830
manifesto as his own brothers kind of 
fucking crazy writing of.

1396
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:51,150
That's how we get caught.
Yeah.

1397
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,300
Wow.
His brother recognize the patterns and 

1398
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,341
you recognize that the person writing it
had to be very smart and also very 

1399
01:04:58,341 --> 01:04:59,730
crazy.
What a moment to think.

1400
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:04,731
I've got to turn my brother and he was 
probably terrified at this brother that 

1401
01:05:04,731 --> 01:05:09,201
was capable of killing people.
I wonder if he knew it before then when 

1402
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,060
your brother just moved to the woods in 
a shack.

1403
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,770
Starts writing things with no spaces.
Cursive.

1404
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:17,890
Yeah.
Just book after book.

1405
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,030
I need another notebook.
Oh,

1406
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,920
Jesus Christ.
Are you writing?

1407
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,000
I'm writing everything.
Writing everything.

1408
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,220
Documented it all.
Everything that's wrong.

1409
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,320
How to make it.
You think assets done more good or more 

1410
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:31,320
bad?
Overall?

1411
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,300
It's probably more good,
but there's always gonna be room like 

1412
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:36,730
booze.
When we were talking about booze,

1413
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:42,450
some people can enjoy a glass of wine 
and not have another drink for a month 

1414
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:47,041
and everyone's fine.
Some people it's one shot and they're 

1415
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:48,810
off to the races.
One shot goes down the hole.

1416
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:52,660
Does the lids come down over the eye?
Clank.

1417
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,690
Clank that does drunk Lids,
you know,

1418
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:56,710
we'd be like,
where's Greg?

1419
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:01,770
Greg in there.
I never seen you drunk because when I 

1420
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:01,770
met you,
is rick right when you were quitting?

1421
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,170
Yeah.
But uh,

1422
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,960
my mom tries to get me drunk and 
Adelaide,

1423
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:06,250
she pulled out some limited Shalla,
you know,

1424
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:11,080
that lemon liqour in Italy and she 
fucking poor a shot for all of us,

1425
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:15,460
including my 13 year old daughter.
And my mom is crazy.

1426
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:17,610
You know me.
Well,

1427
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,260
I told you about my father.
You think she'd have some awareness?

1428
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,780
She can't stand the fact that I quit 
drinking.

1429
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,610
Why don't you just telling me a story 
about your mom and gambling?

1430
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:30,050
She's a gambler who told me crazy 
casinos.

1431
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,580
Sorry.
Well she goes,

1432
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:35,570
she plays poker two different nights a 
week with all guys and she does good.

1433
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,460
And so she,
uh,

1434
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,520
she,
her and her sister go and they go to 

1435
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,860
these slot machines in yonkers and they 
go down there and uh,

1436
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,240
my aunt goes,
she's got more of a problem than my 

1437
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,061
mother and she wins a flat screen TV.
But her husband doesn't know that she 

1438
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:56,951
gambled.
She's forbidden to gamble because she's 

1439
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:58,360
got this problem.
So he's home one day and a guy knocks at

1440
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,530
the door and he's like,
we got to delivery.

1441
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,490
It's like,
what is,

1442
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:04,550
he goes a 62 inch TV.
Where do you want.

1443
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:05,030
He's like,
W,

1444
01:07:05,031 --> 01:07:06,590
we didn't order a TV.
No,

1445
01:07:06,591 --> 01:07:07,310
no,
you want it.

1446
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:12,590
What do you mean we want it at the,
at the yonkers raceway Kasina you won 

1447
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:15,931
this.
So she had to come home and explain to 

1448
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:16,850
her husband why there was a flat screen 
tv she wanted on the slots.

1449
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,380
It was like the grand prize.
Oh,

1450
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:23,381
that's hilarious.
And then she got run down one time by a 

1451
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:24,050
guy who would just,
one,

1452
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,020
broke her hip in the,
uh,

1453
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:26,780
in the aisle.

1454
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,210
But of the slots.
Whoa.

1455
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:33,680
Wrong place the wrong time.
Guy One got excited.

1456
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,650
Just ran a over ran.
Just ran down the yelling.

1457
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,660
The screaming.
Yeah.

1458
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,780
And just smashed into the ground.
Smashed to the ground.

1459
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:44,130
She was in a wheelchair.
You know,

1460
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,720
it's all gambling.
God Damn.

1461
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,640
Yeah.
How did that get resolved?

1462
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:51,710
Oh God,
I don't know.

1463
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,660
I wonder if there was a lawsuit.
Well,

1464
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:57,520
it's like for him it's like I win all 
this money and then it's gone.

1465
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:58,240
Right?
Yeah.

1466
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,990
Like right there in one movement,
she's going to sue him for sure.

1467
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,380
He said,
just give me the bag.

1468
01:08:03,381 --> 01:08:05,150
Let's walk away.
Do you think she sued him?

1469
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,150
I don't know.
I mean,

1470
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:12,151
it doesn't seem like her nature to sue,
but at the same time the insurance 

1471
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:13,030
company might make her.
Because once you get medical bills,

1472
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,920
your insurance company immediately goes,
well,

1473
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,040
we're not paying these.

1474
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,060
You've got to sue the other person.
Right,

1475
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:18,800
right,
right.

1476
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,800
Yeah,
man.

1477
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,540
Yeah.
If your dog bites somebody,

1478
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,690
you're going to get sued by their 
insurance company.

1479
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,680
Wow.
Yeah,

1480
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,420
totally makes sense.
But a guy running over you like that.

1481
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,240
That's.
It's so awful,

1482
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:42,241
man.
You're an older woman and some big 

1483
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:44,200
fucking stupid dude runs you over.
Oh fuck man.

1484
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,900
And it's one thing if you're like a,
you know,

1485
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:51,901
maybe you were,
you were helping out down at the 

1486
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:52,510
homeless shelter.
Somebody ran you over your gambling.

1487
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,660
He does work in the fucking the one arm 
bandit.

1488
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,610
Yeah.
What the fuck man.

1489
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,920
Yeah,
I don't gamble anymore.

1490
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,530
It's just,
it's just so predictable.

1491
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,960
Yes.
If you look,

1492
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,870
if you look an hour down the line,
it's predictable,

1493
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,050
but feel 10 minutes down the line.
It's exciting.

1494
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,130
Well,
it's a little.

1495
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:15,620
It's a little drug dispensary.
Yeah.

1496
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,810
You know,
you're getting your highs and your lows.

1497
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:22,110
You're getting your anticipation.
You're going to get your reward.

1498
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,860
You're going to get you defeat.
God.

1499
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,940
Damn.
You going to be frustrated.

1500
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:29,030
You want to smoke all the ladies coming 
over the booze.

1501
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,860
Yeah,
double we please.

1502
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,040
Thank you.
Thanks.

1503
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:36,050
It's you're getting one stroke of your 
Dick every like three minutes.

1504
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,490
Not a full hand.
I've just a soft stroke down,

1505
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,940
pulling the foreskin over the crown.
Just a little bit issue.

1506
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:45,620
She releases and then she walks away for
three minutes,

1507
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:49,400
comes back and then you got this weird 
relationship with this dealer,

1508
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:49,880
dude.

1509
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,040
Yeah.
Well this guy is either given you money 

1510
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,040
or taking money away from you,
and he's like,

1511
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,040
Hey,
it's just my job.

1512
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:57,660
That's my job.
Yeah.

1513
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,490
He touches money all day and they barely
pay him.

1514
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,640
The guy's making.
He's making 15 bucks an hour and he's 

1515
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,880
dealing with thousands of dollars.
How much do they make?

1516
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,670
I think it's a union gig.
They get tips,

1517
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:11,020
right?
That's a big part.

1518
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,800
I don't know if they pull tips.
I think they probably pull their tips.

1519
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,310
They pool them all the people together.
That doesn't make sense.

1520
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,560
That would seem like.
Does that make sense?

1521
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:25,590
Is that how they do it?
If you're one of the eight people 

1522
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,590
working in an hour or whatever during 
your shift,

1523
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:29,170
however they do it and you're at the hot
table and your table makes $25,000

1524
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:32,550
in tips just because you circumstances 
were there just because of the.

1525
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,510
The like the schedule,
the routine.

1526
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:39,540
Just a shift cycle.
Now you made a year's money and 

1527
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:39,790
everybody else you're working with guys 
zero.

1528
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:40,840
They're all gonna.
Be pissed at you.

1529
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:45,570
And how long have you been a communist?
I'm just saying I have a friend that did

1530
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,930
it and Columbus side.
Now that's how it works,

1531
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,300
so they shouldn't try.
Shouldn't try.

1532
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,100
They shouldn't be charming,
but no,

1533
01:10:51,101 --> 01:10:53,650
it totally makes sense.
Some of them just,

1534
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,230
you know,
they're so over it and you can tell it's

1535
01:10:56,231 --> 01:10:58,230
like a typical union.
Jack and I love unions.

1536
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,510
I'm all about fixing the fucking unions.
I know there were a problem.

1537
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:04,660
I know they don't work,
but like you see that it's like a flight

1538
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:07,000
attendant or a dealer.
When they're over it,

1539
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:09,310
it's like you gotta just put them out to
pasture.

1540
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,440
He can't keep them working in your 
business.

1541
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,940
When they don't smile,
they don't.

1542
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:13,980
Their

1543
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,240
energy is negative.

1544
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,760
Get them the fuck out.
It's bad for business.

1545
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,840
It's bad for business.
Yeah,

1546
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,940
it's man.
What can you do though?

1547
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:24,940
Well,
it's seniority.

1548
01:11:24,941 --> 01:11:27,100
That's the problem.
You're getting the oldest,

1549
01:11:27,101 --> 01:11:28,090
most tired people

1550
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:31,570
working.
Let.

1551
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,260
That's why I like a new airline.
You know?

1552
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,740
You got a virgin.
Virgins Gray.

1553
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,670
Yeah.
They got hot,

1554
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:39,130
young,
beautiful flight attendants.

1555
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:41,200
After a while.
People just don't want to work anymore.

1556
01:11:41,201 --> 01:11:43,120
Man.
I think people work too much.

1557
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,880
I think they work too long.
You know?

1558
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,880
I think that's part of the problem.
When did you become a communist?

1559
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,670
Today?
Right after Jamie and made sense.

1560
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,200
Jamie made sense with the tips.
I'm like,

1561
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:57,550
he's right.
I don't stick to my ideas.

1562
01:11:57,551 --> 01:12:01,180
Folks call it flip flopping.
I'm not married to these motherfuckers.

1563
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,470
Well,
that's why this is,

1564
01:12:02,471 --> 01:12:04,870
you know,
this is an open dialogue.

1565
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:07,030
We're here to change and grow.
Yes.

1566
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:10,910
Trying to change and grow.
Trying to learn some information or what

1567
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,330
a great fucking.
I've talked about this yesterday,

1568
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:18,331
but Neil degrasse Tyson had this great 
twitter quote that said there should be 

1569
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:20,310
an option in this presidential election 
for an all presidential elections,

1570
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:23,740
I think you said for none of the above,
and then if none of the above wins,

1571
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:26,650
we have to start all over again with new
people like it.

1572
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:29,290
That would definitely be the case this 
time.

1573
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,600
That's actually a really good idea.
Yeah,

1574
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,320
that's a really good idea.
Yeah.

1575
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:38,910
Well,
none of the above requires a 

1576
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,921
congressional reexamination of the 
election process and the potential 

1577
01:12:41,201 --> 01:12:42,840
candidates and what makes them 
qualified.

1578
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,620
Yep.
We do it live on television.

1579
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:47,050
There's long discussions like for days 
and days and days,

1580
01:12:47,051 --> 01:12:48,910
like on Cspan,
you know,

1581
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:52,090
remember those you ever watch cspan just
watched people argue about shit.

1582
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,040
Now you're watch that.
That's interesting.

1583
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1584
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:59,740
It's interesting to see how the courts 
work and everything so formal and I 

1585
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,830
guess you have to have like these really
clear rules when you're all talking.

1586
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:05,860
The gentleman has five minutes to 
address when you ever have anything 

1587
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:05,860
formal.

1588
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,330
Well,
they said it has rules because when it 

1589
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:13,241
was first created,
it was the southerners and they were 

1590
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:15,431
genteel.
So to this day when I'm talking to 

1591
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:16,010
another member,
you never say you.

1592
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,780
You're not allowed to say you to 
somebody.

1593
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,250
You say the d senior,
the senior senator from Wisconsin?

1594
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:23,450
Yes.
Said,

1595
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,800
uh,
you know.

1596
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:29,820
Yes.
And they say if you want to insult 

1597
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:29,820
somebody,
you're not allowed to,

1598
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,060
but you can say my most learned esteemed
colleague from Massachusetts,

1599
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:37,100
which is a way of shitting on the guy.
Really?

1600
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:37,560
Yeah.
Oh,

1601
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:39,330
that's what they have to talk third 
person about it.

1602
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,380
Wow.
Those are bizarre rules,

1603
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:43,160
Huh?
Yeah.

1604
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,970
Do you know what's really kind of sad 
but fascinating at the same time,

1605
01:13:46,971 --> 01:13:49,970
she knew who was really good at those 
speeches.

1606
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,370
Dom irrera.
Anthony Wiener.

1607
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,000
Oh the best.
He was a politician.

1608
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:59,360
He liked his policies much of a freak.
Well,

1609
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,610
good looking guy.
You gotta put that shit out there.

1610
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,560
Things could look now.
No,

1611
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:04,580
not really.
No.

1612
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,830
Which makes me respect them even more.
For some reason.

1613
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:13,150
He.
He's a fascinating character because I 

1614
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,710
almost think like,
to be that kind of firebrand,

1615
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,120
you've almost got to be Horny,
right?

1616
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,750
You know,
just like a rally the troops,

1617
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,330
like everybody,
like he,

1618
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:25,030
he would get like super passionate and 
they give really good speeches.

1619
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:26,740
Yup.
It's like God damn.

1620
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:31,150
And I remember people thinking like,
this motherfucker is a real politician.

1621
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:34,270
I don't trust a politician that's not 
fucking somebody on the side.

1622
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,050
Let me hear this

1623
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,820
in a minute,
but we're still a no.

1624
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,970
And then we stand up and start.
Boom.

1625
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,840
We had a different process.
We vote yes.

1626
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,710
If you vote yes.
If you believe yes,

1627
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,880
your vote in favor of funding you to 
believe it's the right thing.

1628
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:52,060
If you believe it's the wrong thing,
you know we are following up with your 

1629
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:59,020
regular order,
regular order to get to intimidate 

1630
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:02,510
people into bleeding.
He's right.

1631
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:05,420
He is.
The gentleman is wrong.

1632
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:13,240
Rather than doing the right thing,
it's Republicans wrapping her arms 

1633
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,680
around Republicans rather than doing the
right thing on behalf of the heroes.

1634
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:20,770
It is a shame.
Shame if you believe this is a bad idea 

1635
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:26,470
to provide healthcare view.
That was a different procedure.

1636
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,640
The gentlemen will absorb regular order.
I'd say he's a bad motherfucker.

1637
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,600
The only thing missing is fucking.

1638
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,190
He's a bad motherfucker fucking in 
between every phrase because that's what

1639
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:48,010
he's saying.
He's going to sit the fuck down there.

1640
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,910
He's just too crazy.
Yay.

1641
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:51,720
I love that.
Yeah,

1642
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,010
you're right.
You know,

1643
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,830
this is a fiery guy.
Fiery horny.

1644
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:56,840
Passionate.
Oh,

1645
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:01,710
look at the JFK Johnson and Clinton.
I would argue that he's,

1646
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:07,100
you've never see a politician that has 
that level of emotion that's incredibly 

1647
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:08,640
rare.
So like what he's doing,

1648
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,630
there's very theatrical.
Yup.

1649
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:15,270
Which is what they've always said that 
like politicians are just ugly actors.

1650
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,270
Yeah.
You know,

1651
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,190
like it's like show business for people.
Weren't that good looking?

1652
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:24,230
Yeah.
I mean it's kind of in a way what it is 

1653
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,871
and they don't really have a talent.
Although Bill Clinton did play the Sax 

1654
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,630
Saxophone.
Remember that?

1655
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,940
Yeah,
but that was before he was president,

1656
01:16:29,941 --> 01:16:32,180
right?
Wasn't it when he went on to senior hall

1657
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,660
now running?

1658
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,800
Well,
I think he was.

1659
01:16:34,801 --> 01:16:35,700
Oh,
he was running.

1660
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:40,701
That's right.
Because they say it got into the black 

1661
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:40,701
vote.
Yeah.

1662
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:40,701
Listen,
another one,

1663
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:42,440
he's another perfect example.
Just buzzy.

1664
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,070
Yep.
And he was an animal.

1665
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,030
That's why these people are doing,
but that's why they want to be a leader.

1666
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,880
It's almost like we want to deny our 
very nature.

1667
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,070
We almost want to pretend that people 
like that,

1668
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:58,250
like these crazy fiery people that get 
everybody rallied up that there's not 

1669
01:16:58,651 --> 01:17:01,050
other things that go with that package.
Right.

1670
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,850
Of course he's.
But he's,

1671
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,920
he's went of course weight over the top.
Yeah.

1672
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,040
Took pictures of his kid next to his 
dick.

1673
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,160
Did you see that to the girl can

1674
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,930
weird.
He's weird.

1675
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:16,070
He's got a.
he's definitely sad for the wife because

1676
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:17,440
he just,
you know,

1677
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:19,580
she forgave him.
She took him back.

1678
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:22,730
He said he was going to go to these 
classes and do all that shit and then.

1679
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,710
And then,
you know,

1680
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,450
it's humiliating the first time.
It's pitiful.

1681
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:26,870
The second.
Yeah.

1682
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,080
It's hard out there for a pimp.
Shit,

1683
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,300
you know?
Yeah.

1684
01:17:31,301 --> 01:17:34,390
I'm sure it is.
I'm sure it is a humiliating.

1685
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:40,140
I'm sure it is a.
I mean it's just the whole thing is 

1686
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,981
crazy in the first place that he has 
this compulsion to just chat with girls 

1687
01:17:44,171 --> 01:17:46,600
online like that,
send Dick pics and stuff like.

1688
01:17:46,601 --> 01:17:51,601
It's like for him it's like so fun.
It's obviously so fun and it's beyond 

1689
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,740
insane.
His last name,

1690
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:55,360
his wiener.
It's hilarious.

1691
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:56,000
Yeah,
it's,

1692
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,330
it's,
it's almost like we're living in a movie

1693
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:02,910
at this was in a judd apatow movie.
He'd be like,

1694
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:07,660
why is so obvious?
Name is weening of my 13.

1695
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:13,710
You know?
Dick Wiener was so weird.

1696
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,740
Yeah.
People are weird,

1697
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,720
man.
People are fucking weird.

1698
01:18:19,721 --> 01:18:20,710
They're so weird.

1699
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:22,390
Well,
if you want to be that bad,

1700
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:27,620
I mean it's kind of a thing in life is 
like how passionate do you allow 

1701
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,691
yourself to be?
Because there's a loss of control that 

1702
01:18:30,691 --> 01:18:32,200
that goes with getting that passionate 
and when you,

1703
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,570
when you go for it,
that's when you end up,

1704
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:39,810
you know,
maybe having an affair or maybe killing 

1705
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:40,720
somebody because you're just fucking 
letting your id run wild.

1706
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:43,090
But that's where sometimes great 
creativity comes from,

1707
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:46,060
which is why you get so many great 
artists and directors that ended up,

1708
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:48,040
you know,
woody Allen [inaudible] and his daughter

1709
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:51,010
and you know,
a Roman Polanski,

1710
01:18:51,011 --> 01:18:51,810
like,
you know,

1711
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,830
you just think of all the truly creative
people,

1712
01:18:53,831 --> 01:18:56,440
they do fucked up things because they're
just putting themselves out there.

1713
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:01,950
Well also because a lot of what makes 
them want to be whatever it is in the 

1714
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:05,110
first place,
whether it's an actor or a famous person

1715
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:10,111
or a singer or Kelly or any people like 
to want to be out there that much.

1716
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:11,590
Yeah.
The Ego.

1717
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:12,850
There's some,
some.

1718
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,150
It's got to be some,
some madness involved in that.

1719
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:16,900
Yeah.
Usually.

1720
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:22,140
And a lot of it involves like your 
childhood and how you're wired growing 

1721
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,371
up or what,
what you were missing that led you to 

1722
01:19:26,371 --> 01:19:26,371
push so hard.
Yeah.

1723
01:19:26,371 --> 01:19:27,790
Like everybody that I know,
you included.

1724
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:31,450
That's hilarious.
Had some crazy fucking life growing up.

1725
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,010
Yeah.
You know where it was like,

1726
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:38,011
you know when you tell me the story 
about your parents chain smoking in the 

1727
01:19:38,011 --> 01:19:40,891
house while you were just locked in the 
winter with the windows closed and 

1728
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:41,110
you're like a baby.
I'm going,

1729
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:46,111
I had asthma inhaler.
Fucking quit smoking in front of.

1730
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,390
In the car with your kid who has an 
asthma inhaler in his pocket.

1731
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:50,170
No,
I can't.

1732
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:51,940
No,
I can't.

1733
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,340
I can't.
Fuck.

1734
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:58,750
We used to give them for presence here.
Do you remember this?

1735
01:19:58,751 --> 01:20:03,751
In Art Class?
You'd get shells and you'd paint the 

1736
01:20:03,751 --> 01:20:03,751
shells.
Like little clam shells.

1737
01:20:03,751 --> 01:20:05,350
You ever do that?
And you paint them.

1738
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:07,920
You glaze them and bake them.
And then we give given to my parents and

1739
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:09,210
they've used them as ashtrays.

1740
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,180
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1741
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,790
It's like putting a cigarette out in 
your little heart.

1742
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,390
Here's what I think of those three 
hours.

1743
01:20:22,391 --> 01:20:26,890
You spend the art class too.
That's a pole.

1744
01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:28,300
That's an undeniable one,
right?

1745
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:33,640
Smoke cigarette one.
That seems like everybody gets that one.

1746
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,970
Like the alcohol pole.
It's like some people get it,

1747
01:20:36,971 --> 01:20:41,971
some people don't.
Some people can drink a little and not 

1748
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:41,971
drink for awhile.
Cigarettes.

1749
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:46,681
It seems like almost everybody who gets 
into it gets stuck.

1750
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:51,830
Yeah.
It seems like it's like if you were 

1751
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,680
looking at it as a Jujitsu artists,
it's got a very high rate of finishes.

1752
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:58,740
Yeah.
Like there's certain guys that get into 

1753
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:58,740
certain positions,
like you might be fucked.

1754
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,700
Like,
uh,

1755
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,760
there's this Guy Damien Maia fights in 
the UFC strangles everybody and he's 

1756
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:04,870
just one of those guys when he gets on 
your back,

1757
01:21:04,871 --> 01:21:05,790
you're like,
Ooh,

1758
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,600
you're.
You probably fucked.

1759
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:08,520
Yeah.
He's the,

1760
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,560
he's got a very high rate of finishing 
and that's like if you're smoking 

1761
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,471
cigarettes for three months,
get Tina headline smoking cigarettes 

1762
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:16,471
everyday for three months.
Come on.

1763
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,770
Let's be honest.
No,

1764
01:21:17,771 --> 01:21:19,030
it's chemical.
Yeah.

1765
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:19,510
Yeah.

1766
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,750
I mean they say they say that it's tough
for them to.

1767
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:23,620
Heroin Addiction.

1768
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,920
I can imagine.
A really good.

1769
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:32,500
I really could imagine.
I've heard people argue back and forth 

1770
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,921
about the heroin thing.
I had this Guy Dr Carl Hart on my 

1771
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:35,590
podcast and it was actually being 
discussed recently on the message board,

1772
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:37,170
which is why I'm bringing it up where 
they were.

1773
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:42,200
There were saying that he's not correct 
about because he says he's actually 

1774
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,450
experimented with a bunch of drugs 
himself,

1775
01:21:43,451 --> 01:21:48,451
is pretty open about it,
but he's also a like a brilliant 

1776
01:21:48,451 --> 01:21:51,631
academic writes books.
He's an addiction specialist and he's 

1777
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:55,891
like,
there's so much misinformation when it 

1778
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:55,891
comes to heroin withdrawal.
He goes,

1779
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:57,370
it's like being sick.
It's like you have the flu.

1780
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:58,990
Yeah.
That's literally what it's like.

1781
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:04,170
He's like,
that's the physical embodiment of all 

1782
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,421
the symptoms.
They're very flu like and then they go 

1783
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:06,421
away.
Yeah.

1784
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:06,421
He's like,
there's more.

1785
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:10,050
It's more psychological and there's.
There's so much more going on about 

1786
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,591
this,
like sort of dependency on this 

1787
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:13,591
substance.

1788
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:14,080
It's not just like a physical 
dependency,

1789
01:22:14,081 --> 01:22:19,081
like there's a bunch of other factors 
that sort of can't be denied or ignored 

1790
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:20,320
and they all play in together,
but then other people on my message what

1791
01:22:20,321 --> 01:22:20,920
we're saying,
no,

1792
01:22:20,921 --> 01:22:23,260
you're wrong.
Like tried to kick heroin.

1793
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:28,261
It was unbelievably hard on my body was 
in shock and then then another dude who 

1794
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:32,761
said that all he did was get on a plane 
and go somewhere where he knew he 

1795
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:34,390
couldn't get heroin for a while and 
that's how he kicked it.

1796
01:22:34,391 --> 01:22:34,930
He said,
fuck it,

1797
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:39,931
I'm just not going to do this anymore.
And he said it was only like a few days 

1798
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:40,420
of feeling like a flu.
I don't know who the fuck is.

1799
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:41,470
Right?
And I also don't know.

1800
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:43,270
Again,
if it's the same for everybody,

1801
01:22:43,271 --> 01:22:45,580
it's like the alcohol thing,
all these different things.

1802
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:46,010
Totally.

1803
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,950
Some people have addictive behaviors,
personalities,

1804
01:22:48,951 --> 01:22:53,951
but I think the problem is is just 
because you kicked the drug,

1805
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:59,420
you're now back to square one and square
one was I need drugs.

1806
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:04,860
You may not be addicted,
but you still didn't do the work 

1807
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,280
necessary to rebuild your foundation and
to have dependency issues.

1808
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:11,281
So now you're at a weakened state 
because you've just had the flu and you 

1809
01:23:11,281 --> 01:23:12,970
need to start going to meetings,
being disciplined,

1810
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,250
you know,
go whatever it takes to,

1811
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,970
if it's talk therapy or exercise,
whatever it is and makes you write,

1812
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,910
you need to transition into that 
immediately.

1813
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:22,800
And most people,

1814
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,300
well don't,
you know,

1815
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,080
had you ever smoke.
I smoked a cigarette or two with my 

1816
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,221
sister when I was 15 and she was 14.
We moved into this new neighborhood and 

1817
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:39,520
hung out with the local tufts.
Hey Joey.

1818
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:42,550
And we went to the bridge.
We went down to the bridge.

1819
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,920
There's this place near my house called 
Eco Bridge.

1820
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:48,130
It was actually right across the street 
from my house when I was growing up.

1821
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:53,210
And uh,
you could get under the bridge and you 

1822
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:53,560
could yell and it echoes in this crazy 
way.

1823
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,240
It's in Newton,
upper falls,

1824
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:57,300
Massachusetts.
And um,

1825
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:59,660
we'd go down there and sing billy squire
song.

1826
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:04,440
What did you find yourself alone?

1827
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:05,660
And it was all,
you know,

1828
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,040
at people feeling each other up and 
drinking beers.

1829
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:11,850
I snuck out of their dads kitchen the 
best times of your life.

1830
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:13,440
Very strange times,
man,

1831
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:16,380
very strange times.
It doesn't get much better than that,

1832
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,120
sadly.
Well,

1833
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,430
it was a,
it was all very interesting.

1834
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,490
And then,
um,

1835
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:27,170
there was a kid who was a little bit 
older than us that we knew that we were 

1836
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:27,170
hanging out.
That's it.

1837
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:27,570
It's right by the Charles River.
That's where I grew up.

1838
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,450
Q and a good job today.
Jamie's done the ball son.

1839
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:35,980
Um,
but there's a kid who was in my 

1840
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,510
neighborhood who killed somebody drunk 
driving and killed his best friend while

1841
01:24:36,511 --> 01:24:38,940
we were all in high school together.
Leaving Echo Bridge.

1842
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:39,300
No,
no,

1843
01:24:39,301 --> 01:24:41,400
no.
But it was that kind of thing,

1844
01:24:41,401 --> 01:24:42,780
you know,
it was like everybody was partying.

1845
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,870
People are going,
that's all anybody wanted it to do.

1846
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,640
So everybody's going to parties.
You know,

1847
01:24:47,641 --> 01:24:48,920
Mike,
he's having a party this weekend.

1848
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:50,100
You go and dog,
he's got a party.

1849
01:24:50,101 --> 01:24:50,730
We're gonna go,
hey,

1850
01:24:50,731 --> 01:24:52,470
we got to find a place to party.
And there was.

1851
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:55,150
This is like the cave caveman days.
Yeah.

1852
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,750
We're talking about like the 19 eighties
people were cavemen.

1853
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,670
No one had phones.
There was no,

1854
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:04,671
there was.
Most people didn't even have fucking 

1855
01:25:04,671 --> 01:25:04,671
answering machine.
Yeah,

1856
01:25:04,671 --> 01:25:05,490
no basic cable.
You had like three channels.

1857
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,750
Yep.
So,

1858
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:11,751
uh,
people would just wind up getting drunk 

1859
01:25:11,751 --> 01:25:14,400
and they were kids and a lot of them 
drove home drunk and I tried really hard

1860
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,770
not to,
but I'm sure it probably did it at least

1861
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,590
two or three times on when I was a 
teenager.

1862
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:21,880
I drove to the point where I definitely 
shouldn't have been driving.

1863
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,960
Oh,
I drunk drove fucking three nights a 

1864
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:26,960
week,
like severely drunk.

1865
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,630
It was crazy.

1866
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,630
Yeah.
Well Luckily I wasn't drinking that much

1867
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:35,660
because it was like,
right when I just started transitioning 

1868
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,690
to getting into martial arts and from 
then on I pretty much stopped partying.

1869
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:41,691
Totally.
But it coincided with this dude around 

1870
01:25:41,691 --> 01:25:41,691
the same time.
Um,

1871
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,170
I'm not sure like numbers wise,
I might be off by a year or two,

1872
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,760
but it was around that area where I was 
realizing that there was a lot of us.

1873
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,310
They were like doing a really 
irresponsible,

1874
01:25:53,311 --> 01:25:58,311
dangerous shit,
like driving drunk and being drunk all 

1875
01:25:58,311 --> 01:25:58,470
the time.
Going to these parties and having fun.

1876
01:25:58,471 --> 01:26:00,980
And I'm like,
this is like someone's going to drown so

1877
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:03,620
it's going to fall off a roof,
some shit's going to go down.

1878
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,980
And then this dude,
I guess he hit a tree or something like 

1879
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,100
that and killed his best friend.
Did he survive?

1880
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:12,850
He survived,
you know,

1881
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,860
what a thing to live with.
And we were all like,

1882
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,920
oh shit.
The cops actually broke it to them that 

1883
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:20,920
way.
You killed your best friend.

1884
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,750
Like that's what they said when he was 
coming out of the unconsciousness in the

1885
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:26,000
hospital.
That's how they explained it to him.

1886
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,620
You killed your restaurant.
Like what?

1887
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,830
Jesus just probably blitzed,
you know.

1888
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:34,730
And also probably if I had a guess,
I think he was a little older than me.

1889
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,460
I might've been like 17 at the time,
so he was 18,

1890
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:40,550
18 and it's done.
It's over kid,

1891
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,410
maybe I,
maybe I have it wrong.

1892
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:45,470
16 and 17.
But it was somewhere in that range of.

1893
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:50,471
He's a young guy who was just starting 
to drive and now all of a sudden his 

1894
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:52,940
friend's dad and he's got that mark on 
him for the rest of his life.

1895
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,980
And I remember thinking,
alright,

1896
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,970
fuck drinking,
fuck all this fuck pot.

1897
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,160
I didn't want to have nothing to do with
anything,

1898
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:06,700
anything that was going to ruin my life.
And like you can really ruin your life 

1899
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,240
and other people's lives and the loved 
ones with those other people.

1900
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:09,430
Yeah.

1901
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:14,540
Lot of narrow escapes.
I think about the situations.

1902
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:15,950
It's true.
There's a ripple effect.

1903
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,520
You can change whole communities with 
one action.

1904
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:22,790
Yup.
If I had a buddy growing up and he was a

1905
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:27,940
bad alcoholic ice to take an AA meetings
and people try to do interventions and 

1906
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:29,700
he was just really,
really chemically bad.

1907
01:27:29,701 --> 01:27:32,000
He was Jacqueline Hyde personality,
you know,

1908
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:33,110
he when,
when he was sober,

1909
01:27:33,111 --> 01:27:38,111
he was the greatest guy in the world.
Loved hanging out with them and he gets 

1910
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:38,420
drunk and he tried to fight me.
I was crazy.

1911
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,840
And so one night he was driving,
he had his girlfriend in the car and 

1912
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,740
they got into a fight.
And so like he left her,

1913
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:48,590
she got out of the car and then he got 
on the highway,

1914
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:50,330
but then he stopped to go back and get 
her.

1915
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:55,340
So we got back on the highway going the 
opposite direction and hit a car head on

1916
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,860
and killed the two people and died.

1917
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,140
Oh.

1918
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:04,590
And it was like the town still.
It's like his family is so intertwined 

1919
01:28:05,291 --> 01:28:07,310
in my town,
um,

1920
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:11,140
that it was like a,
almost like a political party there.

1921
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:11,950
So,
you know,

1922
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:15,210
part of it will.
You think about Ted Kennedy,

1923
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,980
Ted Kennedy Day.
I keep bringing them up,

1924
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:20,800
but uh,
that chappaquiddick thing.

1925
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:25,860
Chappaquiddick bridge where he was drunk
and his car went into the water and his 

1926
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,150
girlfriend drowned.
Yeah.

1927
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:28,810
And he didn't report it until hours 
later.

1928
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,860
Next morning.
Yeah.

1929
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:30,370
Yeah.

1930
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:36,620
And end it with him.
I got the sense that he'd been driving 

1931
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:36,620
drunk every fucking night.

1932
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:38,380
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1933
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,650
Competing ski.
You don't get that face.

1934
01:28:40,651 --> 01:28:41,930
Mary Jo.
Mary Jo.

1935
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,980
Yeah,
man.

1936
01:28:43,981 --> 01:28:45,540
We always remember that when we were 
kids.

1937
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:46,260
There it is.

1938
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,730
He just fucking left later.

1939
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,300
Wow.

1940
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,670
It's so dark.
I wonder if you could have saved her.

1941
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,080
I just went off the bridge.
Drunk as fuck off the bridge.

1942
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:06,380
She drowns.
That's something he had to carry with 

1943
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:06,380
him,
right?

1944
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,920
Or not.
Some people carry stuff more than 

1945
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:12,920
others.
I mean he continued to drink.

1946
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,670
That wasn't his bottom out point,
you know,

1947
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:18,290
who might've drank to forget.
Yeah.

1948
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,310
Something like that.
He had a lot to forget.

1949
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,170
He had two brothers that were 
assassinated.

1950
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:26,840
The one who died flying a plane in world
war two or you know,

1951
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
joe and he lived to see his nephew.
A Di flying his plane.

1952
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,400
Remember that?
Yeah.

1953
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,450
That was another weird one.
It was a weird judged the ocean.

1954
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,450
Yeah.
I.

1955
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:43,260
was he fully licensed at the time?
I don't know.

1956
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,600
I think he might've been,
but he should've had more hours.

1957
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:47,060
For what?
At what time of night?

1958
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:48,900
He was flying in the distance or 
something.

1959
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,360
It wasn't a flying and fog as well.
Yeah.

1960
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:53,160
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

1961
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:56,220
His wife was a friend of mine from Bu.
Carolyn bessette.

1962
01:29:56,221 --> 01:29:57,210
Yeah.
We were friends with her.

1963
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:02,330
Holy Shit.
Second most beautiful woman I've ever 

1964
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:02,330
seen in my life.
Other than your wife.

1965
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:02,850
Thank you.
Well done.

1966
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:08,090
Thanks.
I liked how you did this gorgeous woman 

1967
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:08,100
like lit up a party.
Green Eyes Tall.

1968
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:09,750
Just sucking,
striking.

1969
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,570
Fuck.
Flying your own plane,

1970
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:14,100
Bro.
I don't know,

1971
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:19,080
I mean it feels like it might be a lot 
of fucking fun.

1972
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:23,310
I've never done it.
I have been in other people's plans.

1973
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,770
Yeah.
When I was in high school,

1974
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:30,910
uh,
I had a kid who was real good friends 

1975
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:33,591
with one of those,
like 14 and his dad wasn't even 14.

1976
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,650
Why am I rambling?
His uh,

1977
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:42,860
his dad was like a big time hunter and 
fisherman and he would fly around and 

1978
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,780
actually I think it was a poacher in 
fact.

1979
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,950
Oh yeah.
I think he had,

1980
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:49,560
he was missing an eye because he was a 
very strange guy.

1981
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,990
Yeah.
And uh,

1982
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:56,240
we would go camping with this dude and 
he would be outside in Maine and it was 

1983
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,961
like zero degrees out.
He'd be out there in his underwear and 

1984
01:30:59,961 --> 01:31:02,481
as long underwear didn't give a fuck.
So he had ice water in his veins and be 

1985
01:31:02,481 --> 01:31:06,291
so cold out.
And this guy just standing around 

1986
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,800
talking to people with the tee shirt on.
He just didn't give a fuck he fat yet.

1987
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

1988
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:13,640
Bitch,
tits fat gut only fat people that stand 

1989
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,610
out in the cold like that.
He wasn't like an old school,

1990
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:17,730
sort of a survivor type dude in a lot of
ways.

1991
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:22,731
Like he was,
he was a guy who could like stay in the 

1992
01:31:22,731 --> 01:31:22,731
woods and like live in the woods and he 
had a plane,

1993
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:23,330
one of those little,

1994
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,350
one

1995
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,160
of those little shitty prop planes.
Yeah.

1996
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,970
And uh,
like you'd see on one of those,

1997
01:31:28,971 --> 01:31:30,260
uh,
uh,

1998
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:33,570
mountain men episodes with the guys are 
flying over the woods by themselves.

1999
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,270
Yeah.
He had one of those.

2000
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:40,720
And uh,
his son was learning how to take 

2001
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:40,720
lessons.
I went up with him,

2002
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:40,720
so we were like,
you know,

2003
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,510
we were fucking kids,
like really young and he's flying around

2004
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:46,940
this God damn airplane with a,
with an instructor but me,

2005
01:31:46,941 --> 01:31:48,800
him and an instructor because it's 
scary.

2006
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,940
Oh yeah.
Like this thing's a piece of shit.

2007
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:54,290
Yeah.
I mean this is like a Bush plane.

2008
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:56,630
It's like barely held together.
It's like,

2009
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:59,250
it's like a lot of people's cars,
you know,

2010
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,070
you get into some people's

2011
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,580
cars,
you're like,

2012
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:01,630
all right,
I hope we make it,

2013
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:05,450
you know.
And in that case,

2014
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:08,570
maybe a coast onto the shoulder if 
things don't go well,

2015
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,910
like if you were friends with a comic 
and uh,

2016
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,190
they uh,
give you a ride and like,

2017
01:32:13,191 --> 01:32:14,150
hey,
you go into the Improv.

2018
01:32:14,151 --> 01:32:14,840
Can I go with you?
Yeah,

2019
01:32:14,841 --> 01:32:19,841
sure.
And you get into cards and 86 buick you 

2020
01:32:19,841 --> 01:32:20,500
like,
we might not make it there guys.

2021
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,770
We're moving along.
We've got to really.

2022
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:23,120
This might not work out.

2023
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:28,390
I kinda miss that feeling.
Do you know I had aaa and I fucking used

2024
01:32:28,391 --> 01:32:29,050
it.
Yeah.

2025
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:34,051
I think you get three pickups a year and
I just always remember going over my 

2026
01:32:34,051 --> 01:32:34,270
three,
my three ride maximum.

2027
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:35,150
I'll tell you

2028
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:40,180
this,
I do think that the character building 

2029
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,830
aspects of driving and a place where 
your car could break down or get stuck 

2030
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:45,970
in the snow and the ice that we 
experienced when we were kids.

2031
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:51,510
I think there is something that I really
benefited from that I've benefited from 

2032
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:55,300
being scared of the weather for awhile.
Like an understanding like,

2033
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:57,910
okay,
if you drive out there tonight,

2034
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,950
there's fucking four inches of snow on 
the ground.

2035
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:02,560
They haven't done any plowing.
You're going to run into some black eyes

2036
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:07,561
too,
because you know it was raining before 

2037
01:33:07,561 --> 01:33:07,561
it was snowing for.
Got Cold enough to snow.

2038
01:33:07,561 --> 01:33:09,310
Okay,
we're going to do this like nobody.

2039
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:11,470
Nobody has to do that for now.
There's no.

2040
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:16,500
You don't ever have to go out and wonder
whether or not you're going to stay on 

2041
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:16,500
the road.
Yeah.

2042
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,590
I think that was a real issue when we 
were kids.

2043
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:23,250
Couldn't.
Can You keep your car on the road 

2044
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:23,250
whether you put chains on it.
I never did change.

2045
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:23,530
Did you change?

2046
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,480
When I was in Boston,
I did some gigs.

2047
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:30,490
Values changed going up to a that hotel,
the balsams hotel.

2048
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,480
I don't think they would

2049
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,310
booked you.
Is that the one where they could see you

2050
01:33:34,311 --> 01:33:39,311
were swearing?
They kicked you out and made you drive 

2051
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:39,311
home with a moose were on the road.

2052
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:43,940
I drove four and a half hours up to 
Maine to go to this fucking hotel and 

2053
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:48,551
they tell you it's a nice.
It's like the nicest hotel in New 

2054
01:33:48,551 --> 01:33:48,551
England.
It's like it's 150 years old.

2055
01:33:48,551 --> 01:33:51,920
It's like the shining.
It's huge and I drive up there like four

2056
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:55,370
and a half hours and um,
I get there and they go,

2057
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:00,400
all right,
listen to 20 minutes and just please 

2058
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,430
don't say fuck.
So I walk on stage and I go,

2059
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:03,500
well they told me I can't say fuck 
tonight.

2060
01:34:03,501 --> 01:34:05,950
So,
and I say fuck about 10 times and I,

2061
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:11,090
I had checked into my room and unpacked 
my bag was packed and they like,

2062
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:14,810
you're out of here and now it's midnight
and I mean,

2063
01:34:14,811 --> 01:34:17,000
you know,
main black out at night.

2064
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:22,001
I mean there is no fucking light at all.
And just moose deer,

2065
01:34:22,371 --> 01:34:26,930
fucking constant wildlife on this little
two lane road for hours.

2066
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,170
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2067
01:34:28,171 --> 01:34:29,670
It was brutal.
Yeah.

2068
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:33,420
That road from like,
is it Portland to Bangor?

2069
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:36,390
Is that.
What's the first stop when you go across

2070
01:34:36,391 --> 01:34:37,440
the border in the main?

2071
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,930
Um,
I think it's a,

2072
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:43,780
Portland's the most close city one 
that's a little bit closer.

2073
01:34:43,781 --> 01:34:47,260
I'm Kenneth know something bridge.
Okay.

2074
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:48,910
Yeah.
But anyway,

2075
01:34:48,911 --> 01:34:53,911
we would go across that and then you 
would go from this one stop all the way 

2076
01:34:54,821 --> 01:34:58,040
to Bangor.
It was one exit and it was

2077
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,850
60 miles.
Who was a long stretch.

2078
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,440
Yeah,
it's probably like 60 miles.

2079
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:04,700
Right?
I'm not exaggerating,

2080
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:06,530
am I?
I don't think I am now.

2081
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:08,060
We didn't think about that with those 
gigs.

2082
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:13,061
We never think thought about how far was
we just thought about date to write in 

2083
01:35:13,061 --> 01:35:13,061
my calendar.
That's it.

2084
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:14,600
You got a date?
I got an open.

2085
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,970
I'm fucking there.
I don't care where it is.

2086
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,160
No hope.
Never a hotel.

2087
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:23,450
That Balsam's thing was like the only 
Gig you got that we stayed in a hotel.

2088
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,730
Right?
I did a few for.

2089
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:30,710
There was a couple people that booked 
gigs.

2090
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:31,580
Oh,
it was normal.

2091
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:33,680
A.
Oh and Sherry and Sherry.

2092
01:35:33,681 --> 01:35:35,580
Her shares to have a bunch of them put 
normal.

2093
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:40,620
The forehead one,
I believe it was in Maine and it was 

2094
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:40,740
actually like a pretty good gig.
Yeah.

2095
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:46,330
And then a member like there was so many
people that book gigs like build downs 

2096
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:48,080
was booking gigs,
the comedy connection,

2097
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:51,830
the old comedy connections book and a 
Boston comedy was booking Mary cats.

2098
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,080
Yeah.
There was a lot of different people that

2099
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:56,620
realized like digged,
already booked a lot of gigs.

2100
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,700
Yeah.
They'd realize that they can make money 

2101
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,660
just by setting up these comedy nights 
in these bars and so we would travel all

2102
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:08,870
over New England doing these things with
some of those gigs,

2103
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:14,050
like the Bangor one would take you to 
these places where if you weren't a 

2104
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:17,351
comedian,
what are the odds you're just going to 

2105
01:36:17,351 --> 01:36:19,211
go drive up there one day you're going 
to leave Boston and take a three and a 

2106
01:36:19,211 --> 01:36:22,690
half hour drive up through the 
wilderness and there's little tiny ass 

2107
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:25,400
roads in January.
I know and we had no fucking GPS.

2108
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:28,760
We had a map and a prayer,
you know,

2109
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:29,900
and,
and it was like,

2110
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:33,470
you know,
you never knew if you booked the Gig.

2111
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:36,590
If it was more than three months out,
there was a 50 percent chance to Gig was

2112
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,310
cancelled.

2113
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:42,550
I never booked anything that far out.
I don't think now I wasn't that 

2114
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:43,600
desirable.
I was getting gigs.

2115
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:44,930
You were the filling guy?
Yeah,

2116
01:36:44,931 --> 01:36:46,880
I was getting.
If I got a good Gig,

2117
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:47,890
it was like,
you know,

2118
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:53,830
two weeks out or something like that,
but there was the gigs that were like 

2119
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,490
the fucking death gigs at death get 
giggles.

2120
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:57,170
I know they loved you early on.
Right.

2121
01:36:57,171 --> 01:36:58,910
Didn't they use the headline you early 
on?

2122
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:01,690
That was my Clark giggles is Mike Clark 
and Mike Clarke.

2123
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:02,930
Like it was like a kid.
Yeah,

2124
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:04,840
you gotta you gotta clean it up.
Rogan.

2125
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:05,630
Yeah,
he was up.

2126
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,660
It was really funny.
Like it was one of the Clark's brother 

2127
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,410
by the was dirty and one of the best 
comics from Boston ever.

2128
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,580
Like Lenny Clarke is a monster and just 
dirty partier,

2129
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,080
you know,
just an animal.

2130
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:23,110
Right.
They used to do cocaine every night for 

2131
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:23,110
a decade at least.

2132
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:25,190
Yeah.
The second time I ever got paid to work,

2133
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:28,580
I worked for normal a foe and I worked 
at Jay's and Pittsfield.

2134
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:34,210
Pittsfield.
Pittsfield is another place you drive 

2135
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:34,950
way out there.
And um,

2136
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:36,580
uh,
I got offstage,

2137
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:39,170
I opened for Lenny,
I got offstage and Mike was like,

2138
01:37:39,171 --> 01:37:40,610
look,
I'd like to use you,

2139
01:37:40,611 --> 01:37:44,630
but you got to clean it up.
And those fucking Madonna bit.

2140
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:47,030
I mean it was funny Joe,
but you got to clean it up.

2141
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:50,130
You can't.
And then lenny came offstage.

2142
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:54,380
Don't listen to him.
I laugh my balls off.

2143
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,400
Yeah.
When you were talking about the colored 

2144
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,540
kid fucking shop shopping that bit up.
Shopping,

2145
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,460
shopping,
that bit of Fitzsimmons fix.

2146
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,010
Love it.
I love it.

2147
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,840
Fitzy fits.
Dog Fits.

2148
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:08,460
Okay.
I'm to take you down the Cape.

2149
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:11,400
How many fits these?
Did we know Dave Fitzgerald?

2150
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,030
Yeah,
there was.

2151
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:16,720
But in just in Boston in general,
there's a lot of fits.

2152
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:19,320
He's grew up with footsies man.
There's so many.

2153
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:21,410
God Damn footsies.
Hey.

2154
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:24,560
Which one?
Which fitzy fitzgerald.

2155
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:29,840
Patrick Fitzsimmons fit simonds.
There's a time and don't know fit.

2156
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:33,420
Simonds is uh,
the original Irish spelling of it.

2157
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:35,490
And when he came to us they added 
another m.

2158
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,230
Oh wow.
I don't know why.

2159
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,280
Hm.
So Irish heavy community man.

2160
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:45,120
Boston.
So still to this day,

2161
01:38:45,121 --> 01:38:46,500
so Irish heavy.
It's.

2162
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:49,560
Oh,
always interesting in the police force.

2163
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:53,270
All fucking Irish cops,
firemen,

2164
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:56,580
lot of Irish in the Pharma Department.
Politicians also.

2165
01:38:56,581 --> 01:39:01,581
Do you have like different flavors on 
the east coast that you don't get a lot 

2166
01:39:01,581 --> 01:39:02,580
on the west coast,
like Puerto Ricans,

2167
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:04,740
right?
Like Puerto Ricans in New York,

2168
01:39:04,741 --> 01:39:07,620
they had a very real flavor.
Absolutely.

2169
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,100
This is like a layer.
They got style.

2170
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:14,850
We have the Mexican like influence over 
here on the west coast,

2171
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,680
which is like a little bit more laid 
back,

2172
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,850
very laid back.

2173
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:21,810
Very like when you hear trump talk about
criminals and shift from Mexico.

2174
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:24,840
I'm like,
that's diametrically the opposite of how

2175
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:26,460
I picture Mexicans.
Look,

2176
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:27,840
man,
this criminals everywhere,

2177
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:32,340
but I find that Mexican people that I 
meet like especially like in America,

2178
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:37,850
down to Earth,
easy to hang out with is very common 

2179
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:37,850
family,
family oriented,

2180
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:41,580
very common friendly,
hard working work and sense of humor.

2181
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,000
That's not a bad group of people by any 
stretch of the imagination.

2182
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:50,150
It's like what the Republicans say.
They want Christian families that stay 

2183
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:53,460
together and work hard.
It's you gotta.

2184
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:54,330
Yeah,
Mexicans,

2185
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,740
right?

2186
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:57,930
Well,
they're brown though.

2187
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:01,590
I mean it's really like they're from 
over there.

2188
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,780
It's so stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

2189
01:40:03,781 --> 01:40:05,430
I mean,
Ted Cruz is,

2190
01:40:05,431 --> 01:40:09,360
first of all,
his last name is Latino and he's born in

2191
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:14,361
fucking Canada and for a guy like that 
to be against immigration is so 

2192
01:40:14,361 --> 01:40:14,940
hilarious.
Like,

2193
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,830
let's look at your name.
You Fuck,

2194
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:20,730
look at Laura.
You're born rubio is anti immigration as

2195
01:40:20,731 --> 01:40:22,500
well.
They're all crazy.

2196
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,090
Well,
what about fucking trump?

2197
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:29,091
Who's got two wives that were one was 
questionable about her legality with her

2198
01:40:29,311 --> 01:40:34,311
green card,
he could potentially be married to a 

2199
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:34,920
woman who was guilty of illegal 
immigration.

2200
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,960
She's hot.
Who Cares?

2201
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:39,270
She is all that matters.
She's still hot.

2202
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:42,180
She's hot enough to.
She's got the Willy Wonka golden ticket.

2203
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:46,650
It's between her legs and she gets in.
Nobody's going to deny a girl.

2204
01:40:46,651 --> 01:40:47,670
Looks like that.
A green card.

2205
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,490
She let her in and she does the foreplay
yourself?

2206
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,650
Like he just says 10 minutes and she 
gets a little oil.

2207
01:40:53,651 --> 01:40:56,440
Takes a hot tub,
gets a finger going down now hard.

2208
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:59,500
She doesn't penetrate.
Works the outside candles.

2209
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:05,130
Candle Kenny g music or is that just my 
one little soft sack.

2210
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:13,570
Seriously.
Xm and those are real tits apparently.

2211
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,620
Well,
who gives a fuck?

2212
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,690
I do,
but you're not going to touch them.

2213
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:21,420
So who cares because the top,
it just has that little softness to it.

2214
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:22,810
God,
she's gorgeous.

2215
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:24,010
Yeah.
Well,

2216
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:25,630
it's fucking beautiful.
You know her story.

2217
01:41:25,631 --> 01:41:29,840
She like grew up in a fucking farm in A.
Yeah,

2218
01:41:29,841 --> 01:41:31,390
that's how you got to get them.
Where was it?

2219
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:35,490
The Ukraine?
Romania.

2220
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:36,550
Finland.
Holland.

2221
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:38,170
No,
she's Flemish.

2222
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:45,090
Flemish.
After he fucking throws a hot pick one 

2223
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:45,820
in her neck.
She's from Slovenia.

2224
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:50,260
So she was dirt poor and uh,
you know,

2225
01:41:50,261 --> 01:41:53,050
she was,
she entered some beauty contest and she,

2226
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:54,370
uh,
she got seen.

2227
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:59,740
They started sending her on commercials 
and all sudden her New York and she 

2228
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:03,391
fucking was booking work and the Donald 
saw at a party and she was with a guy 

2229
01:42:04,511 --> 01:42:05,440
and he was with a girl.

2230
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:07,380
He made his move.
Diddy.

2231
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:08,980
Yeah.
It's kind of guy.

2232
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:10,540
You want running president?
That's it.

2233
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:15,100
Guy Who can close the guy you got.
It's the guy you got.

2234
01:42:15,101 --> 01:42:19,420
That's what you need folks.
Amanda can close close deals.

2235
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:20,980
Trump trump shirt,
man.

2236
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,420
Period.
Just him.

2237
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,310
Just show him his story.
Animated.

2238
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,730
That's the commercial.
Him taking the girl going upstairs.

2239
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,620
Let's just go for it folks.
Let's hit him.

2240
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:31,090
He doesn't even take his boxer shorts 
off.

2241
01:42:31,091 --> 01:42:36,091
They're wrapped around his ankles.
He's got like expensive gold tip socks 

2242
01:42:36,091 --> 01:42:37,300
on and he probably keeps his dress shirt
on.

2243
01:42:37,301 --> 01:42:40,250
Mostly white rail and her from behind.
Yeah,

2244
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,120
and it says trump.
He closes deals.

2245
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:47,140
It's just an animated.
She's got a laptop on her back.

2246
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:52,190
Yeah.
He's just banging the shit out of her 

2247
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:53,560
and doing stocks and tweeting at Rodeo.
Donald,

2248
01:42:53,561 --> 01:42:55,870
you purge.
You will lose a rosy.

2249
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,620
Sad.

2250
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:00,100
She has to remind him.
He's fucking Donald.

2251
01:43:00,101 --> 01:43:05,101
Couple more down here.
I'm down here to receive Dick.

2252
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,970
I work on my pussy all day for you.
I squeezed a squeeze.

2253
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:12,850
I print by shave.
I perfume.

2254
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:17,940
I'm here to make juice.
I'm going to squeeze and make juice.

2255
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:19,690
We're gonna.
Go to jail.

2256
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:21,490
That's the president's wife.
That's all right.

2257
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:23,740
That's a real possibility.
I mean,

2258
01:43:23,741 --> 01:43:25,330
I'm not sure if it's the wrong one 
either.

2259
01:43:25,331 --> 01:43:30,331
I.
The one thing that I like about trump 

2260
01:43:30,331 --> 01:43:33,181
becoming president is the one thing that
I like is that it throws the whole 

2261
01:43:33,181 --> 01:43:36,720
fucking golf fucking food cart.
Just chucks it over.

2262
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,760
Figure this mess out,
right,

2263
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:44,270
and they've got to figure out a way to 
come up with a candidate that makes 

2264
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:44,350
sense to people.
It already has though.

2265
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:47,830
I think the gop,
the gop new after the,

2266
01:43:47,831 --> 01:43:52,070
after Obama got elected twice the gop 
that they needed

2267
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,660
the black vote,
the Latino vote,

2268
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:56,270
they needed to come more to the center 
and uh,

2269
01:43:56,271 --> 01:44:01,271
they didn't.
And so trump happened and now you gotta 

2270
01:44:01,271 --> 01:44:01,310
think that trump is like the real slap 
in the face.

2271
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:04,430
They didn't receive after the black guy 
won twice.

2272
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:06,670
Yeah.

2273
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:09,410
They know they've got a,
they've got a seriously.

2274
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:15,030
They're to lighten up on some of these 
social issues like abortion or gay 

2275
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:18,431
marriage.
They gotta let it the fuck go and not 

2276
01:44:18,431 --> 01:44:18,860
worry about bathrooms with a girl and a 
boy is back.

2277
01:44:18,861 --> 01:44:20,090
Shut the fuck up.

2278
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:21,900
Yeah,
I agree.

2279
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:27,290
That's why it's moving to immigration.
Immigration is one that taps those 

2280
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:29,070
primal fears of invaders and it's not a 
real issue.

2281
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:30,720
Faders,
right?

2282
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:36,900
They're taking jobs and they're raping.
They take all the fruit off the trees.

2283
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:43,450
The trees are bearing the invaders of 
taking all the good.

2284
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:47,760
That's a weird thing too.
I feel like these are the last hold outs

2285
01:44:47,761 --> 01:44:52,761
to the inevitable conclusion that 
borders are retarded and we can't have 

2286
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:54,690
borders anymore if we all want to 
pretend to be even.

2287
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:58,140
We all want to be like,
we all want to be like kind.

2288
01:44:58,141 --> 01:45:01,650
We want to Holland to treat Finland the 
same way.

2289
01:45:01,651 --> 01:45:03,930
We want Japan to cheat,
to treat China,

2290
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:09,170
that everybody just treat everybody like
they would if we were one gigantic 

2291
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:09,170
community.
Well,

2292
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:10,530
you're not gonna.
You're never gonna have that.

2293
01:45:10,531 --> 01:45:15,531
If you have these places,
we can't go in and he can't get out and 

2294
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:18,441
they can hold you like you can't just 
cross the border and you have to go to 

2295
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:18,441
this place.

2296
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:19,350
They check your bags like what are we 
doing?

2297
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:20,950
Like what are we doing?
What w?

2298
01:45:20,951 --> 01:45:22,160
What are these like,
whoa.

2299
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:27,250
This side,
we've done a better job of managing 

2300
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:27,270
resources and we're not going to pick up
the slack for those brownies.

2301
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:30,270
Brownies with Kuka,
Rochelle music,

2302
01:45:30,271 --> 01:45:32,970
drinking tequila down south of the 
border.

2303
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:36,750
We're going to put up a wall.
Hey had the same opportunities as us and

2304
01:45:36,751 --> 01:45:39,180
they squandered them squandered for 
right now.

2305
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:44,300
That makes sense.
I understand the impulse to do that 

2306
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:47,151
right now.
I understand if you're the person who 

2307
01:45:47,151 --> 01:45:49,191
doesn't want your house broken into or 
you're the rich guy lives really close 

2308
01:45:49,191 --> 01:45:49,680
to San Diego and you're like,
fuck that.

2309
01:45:49,681 --> 01:45:52,140
Keep them over there.
I get the sentiment.

2310
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:57,380
But when you look at it,
if you take yourself out of the picture 

2311
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:58,320
and you look at the overall picture of 
human beings on the planet,

2312
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:00,690
inevitably those things are going away.

2313
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,040
This is only a matter of tower of Babel.
It's got a,

2314
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:08,370
I was in Seattle the other day and I use
this,

2315
01:46:08,371 --> 01:46:11,310
um,
this lens thing on phones.

2316
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:16,580
Have you ever done this where you can 
take your phone and you hold it up and 

2317
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,720
you can,
you,

2318
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,760
you can hold it up to like an image like
a that has writing on it and it 

2319
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:23,990
translates it Italy.
Yeah.

2320
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:26,220
That's amazing.
Incredible.

2321
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:30,900
It reads it the photo.
You're your fucking menu.

2322
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:34,830
You could put up a menu in Italian and 
it'll tell you what the entrees dude,

2323
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,270
dude.
So yeah,

2324
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:38,340
it's amazing.
It's incredible.

2325
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:43,370
I mean,
how long before there's something where 

2326
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:46,461
when someone talks it's immediately 
translate east real time back to you and

2327
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:49,200
you just put a iphone ear thing on.
What's that?

2328
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:49,890
You said they have it.

2329
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:55,520
They have it already.
A fucking moron like me comes up with it

2330
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:56,640
like,
hey,

2331
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:59,550
how about you do this?
We've been working on it for 10 years.

2332
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,220
Here's my test.
If something's good.

2333
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:04,350
Elon Musk is involved.
Yeah,

2334
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:09,530
it's hilarious.
The translate foreign languages in real 

2335
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:09,530
time.
That's amazing.

2336
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:14,050
Wow.
This gadget companies crazy comprises 

2337
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:14,220
two ear pieces that easily fit into your
ears.

2338
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:15,660
Die.
It's fucking amazing.

2339
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:20,160
So when people are talking in $29,
dude,

2340
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:23,740
what's that called?
I'm fucking buying one tomorrow so I can

2341
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,920
stay on.
My kids are saying about me in Spanish.

2342
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:29,880
It's called waverly something we really 
last year that made it waverly labs.

2343
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:32,100
Wow.
I'm on that shit.

2344
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:34,620
Damn.
This is amazing time to be alive when it

2345
01:47:34,621 --> 01:47:36,720
comes to this stuff.
But here's the thing.

2346
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:41,750
All of these things in theory should 
bring us together and break down 

2347
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:42,060
barriers.
Look at Brexit.

2348
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,910
They tried to pull together and then 
fucking,

2349
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:45,660
you know.

2350
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,840
Yeah,
well you know,

2351
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:52,860
wasn't an well,
I need to talk to my friend Steve 

2352
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,630
Hilton.
I've had him on the podcast before 

2353
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:56,630
Hilton hotels.
Well he know he,

2354
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:58,260
he's,
he's a politician from England.

2355
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:01,280
It was her while he was David Cameron's 
righthand man.

2356
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:03,210
Oh yeah.
And now he runs this thing.

2357
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:07,970
I'm over in America.
He runs a startup called CROWDPAC.

2358
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:13,230
Well,
you kind of can find out what the 

2359
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:13,470
candidates stand for you like you put in
what you stand for,

2360
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:16,500
like what heard about green,
it tells you what you should vote for.

2361
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:19,380
One candidate best represents your 
positions on these things.

2362
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:22,950
But he actually thinks that the brexit 
thing is a good idea.

2363
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:25,320
I haven't talked to him,
but uh,

2364
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:27,800
I know that's what his opinion is and I 
want to,

2365
01:48:27,801 --> 01:48:30,390
I would like to hear it.
I want to know what that because I don't

2366
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:31,200
have an opinion.

2367
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,910
I don't either.
I don't understand.

2368
01:48:32,911 --> 01:48:37,911
I understand that they don't want people
to be able to immigrate freely all 

2369
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:41,301
throughout Europe and come to the UK.
Those were England had an issue and I 

2370
01:48:41,301 --> 01:48:42,090
understand that some people think it's 
racist.

2371
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:46,110
Um,
but I don't know enough of it to have an

2372
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:48,360
opinion.
I think it's a populist movement.

2373
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:52,620
I think it got a lot of energy from the 
wrong people and if the focus was on the

2374
01:48:52,621 --> 01:48:54,960
wrong parts of it,
but economically,

2375
01:48:54,961 --> 01:48:58,410
I mean they're,
the pound dropped in value.

2376
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:01,380
Where are the euro dropped in value when
they pulled out?

2377
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:02,940
And uh,
you know,

2378
01:49:02,941 --> 01:49:07,941
a lot of countries said they're not 
going to do business with England for a 

2379
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:07,941
while.
They're going to punish them.

2380
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:08,100
See,
but this is what I'm saying.

2381
01:49:08,101 --> 01:49:10,710
If you look at what we're talking about 
when we're talking about borders,

2382
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:14,310
that's essentially like a,
there's a dissolving of borders,

2383
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:15,000
right?

2384
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,000
That's essentially what they're saying.
Like we're just going to start saying 

2385
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,941
these borders don't mean anything and 
you can move to wherever the fuck you 

2386
01:49:22,941 --> 01:49:23,070
want.
Just pop back and forth from each one of

2387
01:49:23,071 --> 01:49:24,120
these countries.
In Europe,

2388
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:29,150
we're a union like the United States in 
a lot of ways and really probably how 

2389
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:31,440
much bigger.
Who's bigger?

2390
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:35,580
All of Europe in the European Union or 
the continental United States.

2391
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,330
What's bigger physically?
Well,

2392
01:49:39,450 --> 01:49:42,660
Russia's got a ton of fucking land,
but a lot of it's just ice.

2393
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,280
Right?
But as Russia considered Europe?

2394
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:45,900
No.
Is it Asia?

2395
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:47,620
Russia is Asia.
Is it?

2396
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:48,160
Yeah.

2397
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,410
Oh no shit.
Yeah.

2398
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,280
See we're learning.
You didn't know him.

2399
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:54,460
I thought it was pretty Europe.
Dare you racist.

2400
01:49:54,490 --> 01:49:59,490
You're so lucky.
They're white because you can be 

2401
01:49:59,490 --> 01:49:59,490
ignorant about them and no one gives a 
shit.

2402
01:49:59,490 --> 01:50:00,100
I'm like,
well,

2403
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:01,660
you know what I mean?
Because the Russians are white,

2404
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:03,130
like,
called a racist.

2405
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:05,140
How big is United States compared to 
Europe?

2406
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:07,690
Uh,
United States is 9 million.

2407
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:10,420
One hundred 61,923
kilometers.

2408
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:13,990
Europe is 3 million.
So we're 788.

2409
01:50:13,991 --> 01:50:15,220
So yeah,
we're three times larger.

2410
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:17,590
Allegedly.
I mean close to it at least.

2411
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,030
Yeah.
Wow.

2412
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:20,830
Two and a half times the size of 
European Union.

2413
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,050
Okay.
But either way that's a.

2414
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:28,260
These are,
we're talking about two fairly large 

2415
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:30,451
countries.
Still reeling from the fact that 

2416
01:50:30,451 --> 01:50:34,200
Russia's not in Europe.
I can't fucking believe that I'm this 

2417
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:39,730
old and I've been to college and I don't
know that we'll.

2418
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:41,710
Do you know the story of the Mongols?

2419
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:43,630
The Mongols people are now leading.
Listen to this.

2420
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:44,500
Are going.
No,

2421
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:45,140
no,
no.

2422
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:46,540
I know.
I read.

2423
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:51,720
I read the gang biography.
Do so one of the greatest fucking books 

2424
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:55,561
of all time.
Do me a favor and everybody who hasn't 

2425
01:50:55,561 --> 01:50:55,561
heard of this before,
do me a favor.

2426
01:50:55,561 --> 01:50:59,220
Listen to Dan Carlin's hardcore history 
series called the wrath of the con and 

2427
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:04,300
it is fucking epic.
It's mind blowing story,

2428
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:07,510
but Dan Carlin covers it like it's a 
masterpiece.

2429
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:11,350
It's a masterpiece.
It's five episodes on Kangaskhan and his

2430
01:51:11,351 --> 01:51:13,810
family and all the crazy shit that they 
did.

2431
01:51:13,811 --> 01:51:15,460
Yeah.
Oh my God.

2432
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:18,400
The crazy shit was how much they 
conquered.

2433
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:20,530
I don't know if they were the biggest 
conquers in history,

2434
01:51:20,531 --> 01:51:23,740
but I'm a European Russia.
Okay.

2435
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,080
Russia is a European or.
Okay.

2436
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:27,550
The question is blah blah,
blah,

2437
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:28,120
blah,
blah.

2438
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:31,540
Located in Asia,
a part of a larger part of it's huge.

2439
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:36,540
Landmass is located in what is Asia 
while more Russians live in the 

2440
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:36,820
countries.
European part.

2441
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:39,980
Oh,
so it's both interesting.

2442
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:43,810
Disagree on the far western part of it.
So Moscow's the European part,

2443
01:51:43,811 --> 01:51:44,890
close to that.
And then the rest of.

2444
01:51:44,891 --> 01:51:46,870
It's an interesting,
interesting.

2445
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:50,650
So is that all that all that sounded 
knowing that much about the globe,

2446
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,230
even though I do know the earth is flat 
because I go on Youtube,

2447
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,020
um,
ms dot paying attention to that.

2448
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:56,950
No.
Oh,

2449
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:59,770
you don't know now you don't know.
You don't know.

2450
01:51:59,771 --> 01:52:04,771
There's a fucking enormous group of 
people in America in 2016 to think the 

2451
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:08,440
earth is flat and that is a big 
conspiracy where Haley,

2452
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:12,010
there's tons of videos on it.
There's tons of videos on how satellites

2453
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:15,310
are not real,
but their planes in low earth orbit,

2454
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:17,820
they just keep flying around 
transmitting data.

2455
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:22,830
They just constantly find these planes 
around lying about their being 

2456
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:22,830
satellites.
Yeah,

2457
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:23,080
it's,
it's it,

2458
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:28,100
you know what it is.
It's like hipsters that are dressing 

2459
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,871
like the from the 18 hundreds and 
cooking like different 18 and now 

2460
01:52:30,871 --> 01:52:34,000
they're going to go back to scientific 
beliefs from the 19th century.

2461
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:35,680
Wow.
Look at all.

2462
01:52:35,681 --> 01:52:37,990
It's all connected back up a little bit.
They're young.

2463
01:52:37,991 --> 01:52:42,991
Jamie Lukow.
China just sort of rolls into Europe 

2464
01:52:42,991 --> 01:52:47,191
like that and that's why when you look 
at the,

2465
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:53,770
all the different kinds of languages to 
exist in that one area right now,

2466
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:57,790
it's a ton of languages and it used to 
be a ton of currencies.

2467
01:52:57,791 --> 01:52:58,840
I mean,
I try.

2468
01:52:58,870 --> 01:53:03,870
I remember traveling around Europe.
I had a backpack for six months when I 

2469
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:06,790
was 18 and I just hopped around and my 
biggest nightmare was changed.

2470
01:53:06,791 --> 01:53:11,791
Going from Belgium to fucking Holland to
London to front every day you had more 

2471
01:53:11,791 --> 01:53:16,771
money than you had spent.
So now you got these Franks he can't 

2472
01:53:16,771 --> 01:53:17,930
fucking use,
so you've already paid a commission to,

2473
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
to get your money into French francs.
Now you've got to pay money to convert 

2474
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,851
it to pounds,
so you're getting double whacked on 

2475
01:53:26,851 --> 01:53:28,210
every transition.
And uh,

2476
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:30,190
it was fucking huge pain in the ass.

2477
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:36,610
I'll just try and do is get laid.
And so then they switched over to the 

2478
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:36,610
euro,
made everything way easier.

2479
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:39,030
Yeah.
But now that England bailed,

2480
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:42,150
no more European Unions,
so no more euro either.

2481
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:44,690
Now the day you got to keep using the 
euro,

2482
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:47,760
d c is going to continue on.
They're just not going to have England

2483
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:51,360
part of it,
but I'm saying no more euro in England.

2484
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:53,390
No,
I don't think England ever converted.

2485
01:53:53,391 --> 01:53:55,130
I think they stayed with the pound all 
this time.

2486
01:53:55,131 --> 01:53:56,660
Yeah,
they were always half in.

2487
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:56,770
Okay.

2488
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:58,000
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

2489
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,900
We are better than you,
right?

2490
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:06,020
We are not sure if we want you joining.
We've got these lovely pictures of an 

2491
01:54:06,211 --> 01:54:11,211
inbred queen on a five quid notes.
We've thought it over and decided to 

2492
01:54:11,941 --> 01:54:16,650
just let you to sort out on your own.
It'll be over here in England.

2493
01:54:16,651 --> 01:54:21,651
Thank you.
We're going to have a little tea like 

2494
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:23,640
you all fucking there.
They're fucked for awhile.

2495
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:28,730
Already hates them.
Are you going to address your 

2496
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:29,940
fundamentalist problem?
Yes or no?

2497
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:33,540
We will no longer be backing up your 
socialist program.

2498
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:37,260
MMM,
but one day it's going to be what it is,

2499
01:54:37,261 --> 01:54:42,261
right?
One day they're going to figure out how 

2500
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:43,620
to get the whole thing and make it.
One might not be in our lifetime,

2501
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,400
might be a 100 years from now.
Will they abandoned the idea of that's 

2502
01:54:50,131 --> 01:54:51,720
the only way things are going to be 
fair.

2503
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,780
It's like now because the one way thing 
is things are not fair.

2504
01:54:54,781 --> 01:54:59,781
If you live in a really shitty country,
if you're really a war torn part of the 

2505
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:00,930
world or something like that,
you're not allowed to just move anywhere

2506
01:55:00,931 --> 01:55:01,820
you want.
Yeah,

2507
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:03,730
because everybody would just live in 
Miami.

2508
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:09,480
They're just,
they're just a good spot and they were 

2509
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,660
just so overwhelmed that bitch,
you know,

2510
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:15,090
they're just fucking float on over and 
Miami would just be like a crazy market.

2511
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:20,260
Yeah.
It would just be chickens running 

2512
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:20,700
through the streets and people playing 
music in their underwear.

2513
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:23,940
Way more extreme than it is now.
Shoulder to shoulder on the beach.

2514
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:26,490
You'd never get anywhere if you like 
Rio,

2515
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:32,060
but Kansas would be like,
she always took global warming kicks in 

2516
01:55:32,221 --> 01:55:34,200
and everybody's heading up to the 
fucking Midwest.

2517
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:40,170
Wonder,
well that's sort of how it's always 

2518
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:40,170
been.
I'm not excusing people.

2519
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:43,380
One thing that I think gets lost,
this whole climate change debate,

2520
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:49,580
climate change for the record I think is
definitely real and I think it's 

2521
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:55,220
definitely being a being affected by 
human beings and pollution and what 

2522
01:55:57,151 --> 01:55:58,830
we're doing to the environment.
I don't think that's.

2523
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:03,240
I don't think that's deniable,
but I think that that said,

2524
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:06,150
we should also look at.
Forget about what people have done.

2525
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:11,570
I think just we should also be aware 
that this fucking thing changes and it 

2526
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:16,491
changed.
There's ice ages back when people were 

2527
01:56:16,491 --> 01:56:19,101
knocking sticks together and hoping to 
start a fire and still created a nice 

2528
01:56:19,101 --> 01:56:19,650
age,
had nothing to do with people.

2529
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:24,980
The thing fluctuates,
it gets weird and you can go through 

2530
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:28,650
periods where North America is covered 
in a mile high sheet of ice.

2531
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,690
Like was the case 10,000
years ago.

2532
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,360
That's hard to for people to get in 
their heads.

2533
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:36,030
Ten thousand years ago we weren't doing 
anything as far as cars.

2534
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,290
There was net hairspray.

2535
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:42,380
We weren't shitting on the earth at all 
and there was a mile high sheet of ice 

2536
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:44,760
that covered most of North America.
Yeah,

2537
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,910
that's the Great Lakes.
That's all that those flatlands,

2538
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,260
those were plowed over by giant glaciers
just smoosh the earth.

2539
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:54,360
That was 10,000
years ago.

2540
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,700
There's statues from 10,000
years ago.

2541
01:56:57,090 --> 01:57:00,660
There's shit in Turkey that's.
They've discovered that 3000 years older

2542
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:02,880
than that,
so during that time,

2543
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:05,640
without people doing anything,
it's changed radically,

2544
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:10,700
so I'm not exonerating people,
but I'm saying what be a real fucking 

2545
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:14,250
stupid part of this global warming 
climate change issue is that it's become

2546
01:57:14,251 --> 01:57:17,190
some sort of an ideological debate 
between the left and the right,

2547
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:22,420
the left to blame everything on on 
people and the right who say it's all 

2548
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:26,451
bullshit or some of them say it's all 
bullshit or offer solutions that really 

2549
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:28,800
don't take into account the environment 
there,

2550
01:57:28,801 --> 01:57:31,740
but the reality is this fucking planet 
is volatile,

2551
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:32,280
right?

2552
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:37,290
Once again,
it's become a debate where one side has 

2553
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:37,920
to negate the other side for their truth
to be the only truth.

2554
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:39,480
Exactly.
Yeah.

2555
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:40,980
Well that,
that does happen with people,

2556
01:57:40,981 --> 01:57:41,840
man.
We.

2557
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:44,940
We get super rigid and not just an 
opinion,

2558
01:57:44,941 --> 01:57:48,450
but in a side and aside to take.
I think we have to be whoever,

2559
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:50,820
whoever's right,
whoever the wrong about global warming,

2560
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:55,970
we have to fucking wake up as so how 
much resources we have left and how 

2561
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:57,540
quickly we burned in them.
Yeah,

2562
01:57:57,710 --> 01:57:59,610
because there was this something about 
China,

2563
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:03,390
one area of China that's dangerously 
close to having.

2564
01:58:03,391 --> 01:58:07,500
It's a oceans ecosystem.
Completely collapsed due to overfishing.

2565
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:08,510
Yeah.
Feel like.

2566
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,770
Because you think about what the ocean 
is,

2567
01:58:10,771 --> 01:58:11,250
right?
Let's,

2568
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:16,251
let's,
let's turn the ocean into instead of 

2569
01:58:16,251 --> 01:58:16,251
this gigantic,
massive water,

2570
01:58:16,251 --> 01:58:16,900
let's just have it a,
a,

2571
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:22,440
a tank.
The size of this room and all these 

2572
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:25,281
little fish in here.
Fucking and making new fish and then we 

2573
01:58:25,281 --> 01:58:26,030
throw in a few little tiny boats with 
scoopers in them.

2574
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:26,630
I,
they,

2575
01:58:26,631 --> 01:58:31,631
there's scuba round and scoop fish up.
Just scoop fish up and hopefully scoop 

2576
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:36,801
fish up in enough time.
That gives the remaining fish time to 

2577
01:58:36,801 --> 01:58:40,761
fuck and make more fish and then they 
scoop fish up and then they scoop fish 

2578
01:58:40,761 --> 01:58:42,040
up and they keep doing this.
Like how long can

2579
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,260
you do that before there's no more fish?
Well,

2580
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:48,520
it turns out it's about 50,
60 years and where they are at right now

2581
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:50,620
is there's some places that are 
collapsing.

2582
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:51,550
They're like,
wow,

2583
01:58:51,551 --> 01:58:52,740
there's no more fish.
Like,

2584
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:55,840
because it's not just a fisher catching,
it's the ones that feed on them.

2585
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:57,580
Well,
it's not only that,

2586
01:58:57,581 --> 01:59:02,581
it's like there's no sustainability plan
and a lot of parts of the world is suck 

2587
01:59:02,581 --> 01:59:07,231
out as much as you can fuck the world 
and just do it because that's how you 

2588
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:09,280
make a profit and they just,
they're just international,

2589
01:59:09,490 --> 01:59:12,370
international waters.
There's like all this.

2590
01:59:12,371 --> 01:59:14,750
A real weird debate about,
you know,

2591
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:19,760
how you can control people fishing and 
what you can do and they have a hard 

2592
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:23,101
enough time like sea shepherd has a hard
enough time catching people killing 

2593
01:59:23,101 --> 01:59:26,731
whales.
Do you know how they're getting away 

2594
01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:26,731
with killing whales?

2595
01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:27,790
They pretend that it's scientific 
research.

2596
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:34,310
Yeah.
Because every country is allotted 20 

2597
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:34,310
wells a year or so.
Yeah.

2598
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:38,250
So these boats go out and they slaughter
whales for scientific research and then 

2599
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:39,150
they sell their bodies.
Yeah.

2600
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:45,730
It's,
it's like a loophole that allows them 

2601
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:45,730
the profit still off killing whales.
So like,

2602
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:50,010
you could never do that if I could,
will was like a land creature in North 

2603
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:50,320
America where,
you know,

2604
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:55,321
it was this beautiful thing that walked 
by when and we knew there was like only 

2605
01:59:55,321 --> 01:59:56,130
a few of them left.
Like,

2606
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,640
wow,
keep that thing alive.

2607
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,710
How cool it is.
They never heard people.

2608
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,390
They don't,
they only eat plants.

2609
02:00:01,391 --> 02:00:03,490
Know what happened to the orcas at 
seaworld.

2610
02:00:03,491 --> 02:00:08,491
People are boycotting the park because a
couple of them died and it should 

2611
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:10,570
because they were on earth because they 
were on land.

2612
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,920
Yeah.
Well not only that,

2613
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:14,850
I'm one of them tried to kill themselves
themselves.

2614
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,550
Really?
Yeah.

2615
02:00:15,551 --> 02:00:19,580
And one of them like came out of the 
container and laid on the ground,

2616
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:22,060
tried to kill it.
So it makes sense,

2617
02:00:22,061 --> 02:00:24,700
man.
They're supposed to be smart.

2618
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:31,260
Yeah.
It's tough because the ocean doesn't 

2619
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,061
have.
I mean he'd go back to borders at least 

2620
02:00:33,061 --> 02:00:33,061
if you've got a border around a piece of
ocean,

2621
02:00:33,061 --> 02:00:36,430
you can say we can save our piece of the
ocean.

2622
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:39,520
But if China does that,
there's ripple effects and eventually it

2623
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:41,190
affects all the oceans.
Yeah.

2624
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:44,260
You can't tell people where to go unless
they have guns.

2625
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:46,120
If they come over in a battleship,
right.

2626
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:46,960
That's where we can tell them,
hey,

2627
02:00:46,961 --> 02:00:47,920
fuck face.
Right.

2628
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:53,220
But,
but have like a fishing boat probably 

2629
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:53,220
get pretty close.
Yeah,

2630
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:56,940
but they must have like waters that are 
designated for international fishing.

2631
02:00:58,210 --> 02:00:58,990
Yeah.
There is

2632
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,200
looking at part of the problem with the 
marine life and whatnot,

2633
02:01:03,201 --> 02:01:06,590
and I got to this article that says that
they're doing land reclamation,

2634
02:01:06,591 --> 02:01:11,591
which is also destroying what things are
adding new islands in an area in between

2635
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:13,850
different countries where they already 
have islands,

2636
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:17,810
which is a breaking some international 
water laws,

2637
02:01:17,811 --> 02:01:19,250
which is what you guys were just talking
about.

2638
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:22,400
The United Nations is mad at them for 
doing this because it's.

2639
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:27,750
It sounds like it's kind of blocking off
area that should be open for anybody to 

2640
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:27,750
navigate.

2641
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,920
Oh,
that's interesting.

2642
02:01:28,921 --> 02:01:33,921
So they're closing off channels for 
various for various reasons and they're 

2643
02:01:33,921 --> 02:01:34,970
calling it land reclamation.
Yeah.

2644
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,620
I was trying to find out what they were 
doing with the land.

2645
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:39,530
How do you make an island?

2646
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,760
That's a good question.
Like you have a barge and you just shoot

2647
02:01:43,761 --> 02:01:47,920
sand until you just keep pumping.
Just throw all your pool.

2648
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:53,890
We have to.
We have to deal with a billion people's 

2649
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:53,890
poop.
What should we do with it?

2650
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:55,790
Let's just make an island.
Let's make mushroom island.

2651
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:58,540
Just fucking stack it up in a fucking 
magic mushrooms.

2652
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,690
We've seen that one in Dubai.
Yeah.

2653
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,630
There's just a series of islands.
There's two of them.

2654
02:02:02,631 --> 02:02:05,780
One of them that looks like the earth,
like all the continents,

2655
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,140
but uh,
are they floating or those?

2656
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:10,700
Granted,
not whether they're grounded,

2657
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:12,890
but they built them up.
Yeah.

2658
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,120
But you know,
I mean,

2659
02:02:14,121 --> 02:02:16,370
it's so cocky.
Any fucking change.

2660
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:19,040
See,
they have a sea wall around them and see

2661
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:24,041
how the sea wall has like those little 
vents or water could come in and water 

2662
02:02:24,041 --> 02:02:25,010
can come out,
but it'll stop like a giant surge.

2663
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:27,560
So it allows water to escape so they 
don't get overwhelmed.

2664
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:29,180
Wow.
It's really interesting the design,

2665
02:02:29,181 --> 02:02:30,490
but most people think it's not going.

2666
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:35,220
Mother's got to take it off,
take it back,

2667
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:38,100
going to take it all back.
And she took him down here.

2668
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:40,030
Mother's going to go,
oh,

2669
02:02:40,031 --> 02:02:42,420
I think I want to clean today.

2670
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:49,770
Give me that seawall.
She's just pulling out bentleys and 

2671
02:02:50,331 --> 02:02:55,331
Gucci bags and she is doing a concert 
there.

2672
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:00,100
Dead.
Sucks them into our water.

2673
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:01,930
Ask.
Let's try it again.

2674
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:05,060
Take you down to the raw molecules and 
try again.

2675
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,040
The patriots suck sand from one part of 
the ocean and blast.

2676
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:11,190
That's incredible.
Wow.

2677
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,740
Scroll down so I can read what it says.
It says,

2678
02:03:13,741 --> 02:03:17,250
this added 144 miles of shoreline to 
Dubai.

2679
02:03:17,970 --> 02:03:21,660
Holy Shit.
One hundred 44 miles of sand.

2680
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:25,610
Let me tell you about the ecosystem.
They're just sucking sand.

2681
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:28,240
There's living things and that sand at 
the bottom of the ocean.

2682
02:03:28,241 --> 02:03:30,400
I'm whatever,
Dude.

2683
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:32,590
It is really weird how much money they 
have.

2684
02:03:33,730 --> 02:03:38,730
Dubai is like a fascinating exercise in 
what you can do if you have all the 

2685
02:03:38,730 --> 02:03:41,170
money and no class,
how dare you?

2686
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:46,950
It's like the Vegas of countries.
The Vegas of countries dies.

2687
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:52,180
Hilarious.
Whenever I see a young kid and if,

2688
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:55,270
if Ferrari driving down beverly late at 
night,

2689
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:58,720
last little clubs,
all I think is Dubai.

2690
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:03,550
Sky's got a credit card from his dad and
Dubai and he's just tearing it up,

2691
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:08,470
going to clubs and just fucking thrown 
out a credit card for endless bottles of

2692
02:04:08,471 --> 02:04:10,810
champagne.
There was one guy,

2693
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,420
um,
I saw at.

2694
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:16,040
There's a Beverly Hills Hotel,
I forget which one it was,

2695
02:04:16,070 --> 02:04:21,070
but I went to dinner there and they had 
these cars that were from Saudi Arabia 

2696
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:25,860
with Saudi Arabian plates.
They either fly him over here or they 

2697
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:30,461
ship them over here and it's apparently 
the sign of like a super baller is that 

2698
02:04:30,461 --> 02:04:33,710
you keep your Saudi Arabian license 
plates on your boot.

2699
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:36,320
Gadi Iran as you drive around Beverly 
Hills,

2700
02:04:36,321 --> 02:04:38,100
right?
So you're on Beverly Hills

2701
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,050
and a car that cost over a million 
dollars,

2702
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:45,230
a million dollars and you have these 
plates that are not illegal at all and 

2703
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:45,780
no one says shit to you.
Yeah,

2704
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:49,140
because it's obvious that you're some 
prints or some salts in type.

2705
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:54,141
Dude.
He had bill burr has a video up on 

2706
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:54,760
youtube about,
he was in Paris and they,

2707
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:59,810
there's a big thing there of guys from 
the Middle East flying their cars and 

2708
02:04:59,810 --> 02:05:03,711
exactly what you're talking about and 
there's just blot and there's like a 

2709
02:05:03,711 --> 02:05:04,830
convention of them and it's blocks and 
blocks of,

2710
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:09,831
you know,
million dollar cars and it costs $50,000

2711
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:12,210
to ship it over.
Wow.

2712
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:17,600
And uh,
and they'll bring over three or four 

2713
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,030
cars each.
Wow.

2714
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:19,650
That's super baller stuff.
Yeah.

2715
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:23,190
But isn't that one of those things where
it always accelerates?

2716
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:28,580
Like everything continues to accelerate.
Like what made you a super baller in 

2717
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:31,620
1996 does not make you a super baller in
2016.

2718
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:34,110
You've got to get on that next level.
Shit.

2719
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:35,490
Yup.
And then next level should,

2720
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:40,491
if you're a guy from Abu Dhabi or Dubai 
is every year I fly back to California 

2721
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,960
and I spend the summer there.
I don't want to be here for the summer.

2722
02:05:45,961 --> 02:05:48,930
So I fly my boot Gadi I fly my foot 
already.

2723
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:51,450
Yeah.
And just have some ball or pad.

2724
02:05:51,650 --> 02:05:52,530
Yeah.
Beverly Hills.

2725
02:05:52,531 --> 02:05:57,531
And all you do is come all the time,
just shooting loads and the bitches 

2726
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:00,210
shallow.
They smell the loads.

2727
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:05,670
They smelled the jewelry,
the vayd on.

2728
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,630
Well,
if you a girl and you are,

2729
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:13,140
I'm a loose morally,
if you are okay with doing sexual things

2730
02:06:16,441 --> 02:06:21,441
for money,
if you can get a lot of money out of a 

2731
02:06:21,441 --> 02:06:21,441
gentlemen.
Yeah.

2732
02:06:21,441 --> 02:06:25,190
That's uh,
that's the kind of gentleman that you 

2733
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:25,190
would want to get because that guy could
give you a million dollars.

2734
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:25,190
You won't even notice.

2735
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:28,050
It doesn't even think about it.
Some of these guys will put you up in an

2736
02:06:28,051 --> 02:06:30,090
apartment just for when they're back in 
town.

2737
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:31,230
It's a good move.
Yeah.

2738
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:33,390
Solid.
He's also super baller.

2739
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:36,780
Super baller.
Three cars flying on a plane.

2740
02:06:37,050 --> 02:06:39,240
He's getting his feet done the entire 
time.

2741
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:44,540
Smoking a vape pen with sunglasses on.
You get a pedicure on the plane.

2742
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:46,740
Right?
And just setting it up.

2743
02:06:46,890 --> 02:06:49,080
He's got a phone on the plane.
You can have phones on planes.

2744
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:51,150
Remember?
We should always have phones on planes.

2745
02:06:51,690 --> 02:06:52,980
Did we?
Oh yeah,

2746
02:06:52,981 --> 02:06:57,981
that's right.
You could use it across the $100 or 

2747
02:06:57,981 --> 02:06:57,981
something.
Call people,

2748
02:06:57,981 --> 02:06:59,010
you remember that it was in between your
seats and this guy,

2749
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:03,000
he's calling three people in Hollywood.
That's all he's got to deal one gets the

2750
02:07:03,001 --> 02:07:04,760
bitches one gets to,
you know,

2751
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:09,820
gets this place prepped.
We and others like and it's all set up 

2752
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:09,820
for him.

2753
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:09,820
He just shows up.
Yeah,

2754
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:14,660
goes from fuck.
They tell them which cool bar he's got 

2755
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:17,091
to go to.
Which restaurant tip in every $100 

2756
02:07:17,091 --> 02:07:17,760
bills.
It probably has a nickname for ourself.

2757
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:19,220
Like the raptor.
Yeah.

2758
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:24,450
Calls people up the raptors in the air.
Prepare yourself.

2759
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:25,350
Here he is.
Look at him.

2760
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:27,030
Oh my God.
I called this guy.

2761
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:29,520
This is the guy called.
He's got a gold.

2762
02:07:29,570 --> 02:07:30,900
And what does it.
What kind of gun is that?

2763
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:37,870
It says rich kids of Dubai.
So this kid's got some gold plated 

2764
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:38,860
automatic rifle.
He's sucking on.

2765
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:41,260
Is that a vape pen or a hookah?
Because hookah.

2766
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:44,320
Hookah gun is the hookah.
Oh my God,

2767
02:07:44,321 --> 02:07:45,220
you're right.
Oh,

2768
02:07:45,221 --> 02:07:46,810
so it's not a real gun.
Of course it's not.

2769
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:52,230
So that's as hookah and he's on a plane.
So he's smoking a hookah on a plane or 

2770
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:52,230
is that a limo to limo?

2771
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:55,240
That's a car door next to his leg.
I thought it was an actual plane,

2772
02:07:55,570 --> 02:07:57,100
but I mean that's him.
Wait,

2773
02:07:57,101 --> 02:07:58,360
you talked to him?
No,

2774
02:07:58,390 --> 02:08:00,850
no.
I make this guy up and he's real.

2775
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:04,210
I made them up.
But he exists yet rich kids of Dubai.

2776
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,280
I didn't know that.
That was a instagram page.

2777
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:09,490
It's not a super risk to beverly hills 
or whatever.

2778
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:12,070
What's that watch worth?
I don't know.

2779
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:12,970
Is that?
Well,

2780
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:18,660
you'd have to talk to someone who.
Who understands them because that's 

2781
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:19,080
another big Dick Contest,
I'm sure is what you're watching.

2782
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:21,610
Oh yeah.
That's a big thing with those,

2783
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:24,430
those types of gentlemen.
And what kind of car you have,

2784
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:30,750
what year your car is.
I wonder what the most sought after 

2785
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:30,750
woman is among those guys.
White.

2786
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:32,500
Blonde.
Blind.

2787
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,810
Why trumpy looking girls?
Yeah.

2788
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:38,020
Like maybe,
um,

2789
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:42,670
maybe they'll really turn out a Kansas 
girl like daisy dukes,

2790
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:47,870
cowboy hat and one of those,
one of those flannel shirts and ties in 

2791
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:47,870
and not.
Yeah,

2792
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:51,250
she's got boots and he pulls his be God 
if they run to some Texas gas station,

2793
02:08:51,251 --> 02:08:51,520
right?
What?

2794
02:08:51,521 --> 02:08:56,521
She's buying worms because she's fixing 
to go fish and you catch your own fish.

2795
02:08:58,091 --> 02:09:00,790
I have plenty of fish coming my yet.
Look at that guy.

2796
02:09:00,791 --> 02:09:01,420
Who's,
who's,

2797
02:09:01,421 --> 02:09:06,421
um,
how many of them speak English and how 

2798
02:09:06,421 --> 02:09:08,400
many of them are Russian?
Led big.

2799
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:12,070
I need answers.
Yeah,

2800
02:09:12,071 --> 02:09:15,250
man.
These guys ball don't hate Jamie Hayden.

2801
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:18,780
Lot of hating on.
They're just punching lucky.

2802
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:21,820
God.
I love guys that write stuff like that.

2803
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:24,910
Like you would kill to hug one of those 
girls.

2804
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:27,880
How about this dirty bitch?
I want to join you ladies.

2805
02:09:31,570 --> 02:09:36,570
See folks,
it takes every kind of people that the 

2806
02:09:36,570 --> 02:09:38,170
song wasn't.
It takes for people to,

2807
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:39,010
to,
to,

2808
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,300
to.
What does that.

2809
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,810
We just pull it up right there.
I wanted to join.

2810
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:44,620
Oh well,
don't be mean.

2811
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,480
Don't go onto her page.
Don't blow her up.

2812
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:49,030
She's a freak.
You can't stop freaks.

2813
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,070
Yeah,
that's the whole thing.

2814
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:52,630
Those clubs that,
that,

2815
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:53,530
you know,
uh,

2816
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:56,860
that entertain those types of people.
Oh yeah.

2817
02:09:56,861 --> 02:09:58,060
You know,
they have to change that.

2818
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:00,070
It's always got a new name every three 
years.

2819
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:03,760
It's always like one word,
utopia or whatever.

2820
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
And uh,
and they have to do multimillion dollar 

2821
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,450
renovations have to or else people 
stopped going there.

2822
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:12,910
Yeah.
And it's an unknown strategy.

2823
02:10:13,150 --> 02:10:14,740
It's like what people like,
you know,

2824
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:17,260
Cock fest is opening.
It's opening next week.

2825
02:10:17,261 --> 02:10:19,990
You come in and Scott Fest,
is that a,

2826
02:10:19,991 --> 02:10:21,280
is that at Aria?
Yeah,

2827
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:23,860
it's amazing.
You know Dj fuck faces there.

2828
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:26,470
Dj fuckface left the trop.
Yeah,

2829
02:10:26,471 --> 02:10:28,070
he's,
he's done with them.

2830
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:30,460
They fucked him.
It's just bullshit.

2831
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:33,560
They scratched his records.
How much do you want?

2832
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,160
Eh?
They're like essentially like if vegas 

2833
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:40,400
had like a test,
we test people for ecstasy before and if

2834
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:42,230
they failed you wouldn't let him in the 
club.

2835
02:10:42,510 --> 02:10:45,560
There'd be no one in the front.
The clubs like it is a weird thing.

2836
02:10:45,561 --> 02:10:50,561
There's a lot of drinking for sure,
but the amount of people that are going 

2837
02:10:50,561 --> 02:10:54,080
to see those crazy dj shows that they 
have in vegas and probably Malian up out

2838
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:55,370
of their mind.
Probably.

2839
02:10:55,610 --> 02:10:56,390
Jamie,
what would you ask?

2840
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:58,040
You're a young man,
would you say?

2841
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:00,130
How many people that are going to see 
these,

2842
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:03,800
um,
vegas musical shows are doing ecstasy?

2843
02:11:05,150 --> 02:11:07,690
80 to 90 percent.
That's what I'm sure,

2844
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:13,050
if not more.
Not all of them because there's people 

2845
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:13,050
that don't.
I just want to do it,

2846
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:13,850
but almost all.
80 to 90 percent son.

2847
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:16,850
That shit fucks up your head,
doesn't it?

2848
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:18,720
Molly?
I allegedly.

2849
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:20,360
I hurt you.
Crashed the next day.

2850
02:11:20,361 --> 02:11:25,360
Really hard because your brain has been 
just soaked in water.

2851
02:11:25,450 --> 02:11:28,940
The chemicals you get soaked in a,
you get dopamine,

2852
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:31,880
then you get withdrawal from it.
Right the next day.

2853
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:36,260
Look at this excess Las Vegas unveiled 
$10,000,000

2854
02:11:36,261 --> 02:11:37,850
makeover.
Holy Shit.

2855
02:11:37,851 --> 02:11:41,030
Look at that place.
That's like the ice palace and frozen.

2856
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:46,840
Let it go back to one of those pools 
where you just stand in like Ian Edwards

2857
02:11:50,991 --> 02:11:53,720
joke.
You don't swim in that pool.

2858
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:56,150
That's hilarious.
That place it's awesome.

2859
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:57,170
Um,
yeah,

2860
02:11:57,171 --> 02:11:59,840
I did.
I did ecstasy once and uh,

2861
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:04,980
I never did it again if fucked me up.
I had a great time when I was on it 

2862
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:04,980
though.
And I learned a lot of shit.

2863
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:07,100
Learned a lot of shit about.
I'm like,

2864
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:12,101
you take it just dissolves insecurities 
like they're gone and it like gives you 

2865
02:12:12,101 --> 02:12:17,081
like a,
an insight into like the structure of 

2866
02:12:17,081 --> 02:12:17,081
the building,
of your personality,

2867
02:12:17,081 --> 02:12:19,040
like takes away the walls and you're 
like,

2868
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:22,220
oh here's the support frame and this was
like the door with it.

2869
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:23,200
Everything goes through like,
oh,

2870
02:12:23,201 --> 02:12:24,020
okay,
I got it.

2871
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:29,440
So like insecurity is all this,
like a guard that's constantly on the 

2872
02:12:29,811 --> 02:12:34,811
lookout for your peace of mind and for 
your go eat your self esteem and for 

2873
02:12:37,131 --> 02:12:38,550
your relaxation.
Like it's good.

2874
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:39,730
Got You covered.
I've got you covered this.

2875
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:44,770
So this thing is like,
this tension is around you all the time 

2876
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:48,100
and it manifests itself in a bunch of 
different ways and one of them 

2877
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:50,680
insecurity.
And when you take that initial ecstasy 

2878
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,410
experience and it dissolves that 
feeling,

2879
02:12:51,411 --> 02:12:52,430
you go,
oh,

2880
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:56,570
like there's a lot of weird shit that 
people trip on for no reason.

2881
02:12:56,571 --> 02:13:01,571
And me,
me weird shit that I would trip on for 

2882
02:13:01,571 --> 02:13:01,610
no reason.
That makes you wonder like,

2883
02:13:01,611 --> 02:13:04,970
how much time am I wasting with these 
really poor thoughts?

2884
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:07,550
How much energy?
So much energy.

2885
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:13,230
Like I was thinking the other day,
what is it like to work at the national 

2886
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:16,550
enquirer?
We'd talk about like blowing out massive

2887
02:13:16,551 --> 02:13:20,900
amounts of energy on nonsense.
Like I was at the counter,

2888
02:13:20,930 --> 02:13:25,930
I was picking up some fruit and A.
I went to the supermarket and I stopped 

2889
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:31,030
in the line to put my stuff on and 
there's this national choir thing that 

2890
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:33,671
says I sold coke to Matt Lauer and below
it it says

2891
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:42,480
Larry King,
Larry King's wife caught cheating on him

2892
02:13:42,481 --> 02:13:44,820
and then there was another one.
There was some other scandal on it too.

2893
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:46,380
It was like,
this is hilarious.

2894
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:51,381
Larry King gives a fuck if his wife is 
getting laid it probably pay the cab 

2895
02:13:51,381 --> 02:13:51,750
fare.

2896
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:56,720
You Shit me.
So he doesn't have to disappoint her one

2897
02:13:56,721 --> 02:13:58,690
night.
I don't know.

2898
02:13:58,770 --> 02:14:00,740
I deserve it.
I don't know.

2899
02:14:00,741 --> 02:14:02,930
Poor Larry.
I saw him on a show recently.

2900
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:05,690
I think it was like Colbert.
Remember we were watching it.

2901
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:10,930
Jeremy,
what was that show that we were 

2902
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:10,930
watching?
His body looks very strange.

2903
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:12,530
Very strange.
Just curling right.

2904
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:13,820
Well,
it's way worse than that.

2905
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:14,390
It's,
um,

2906
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:19,790
there's something going on where there's
no tissue in between his bones.

2907
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:24,820
Yeah.
So like when he sits there he'll like 

2908
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:25,250
sit down.
Everything just sort of collapses like a

2909
02:14:25,251 --> 02:14:27,770
folding chair and assumes these weird 
angles.

2910
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:30,380
Like you sitting there and he's got like
one arm up,

2911
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:31,220
like,
look at that.

2912
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:33,110
Look at that picture right there.
Yeah,

2913
02:14:33,710 --> 02:14:35,480
that's one.
But there was another one when he was on

2914
02:14:35,481 --> 02:14:37,670
the couch.
I want to say he was on the couch of the

2915
02:14:37,671 --> 02:14:40,160
Colbert show.
I want to say that's what he was doing.

2916
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:44,270
Um,
and it was just fucking strange to look.

2917
02:14:44,271 --> 02:14:45,170
I like,
oh Larry,

2918
02:14:45,171 --> 02:14:50,171
like you got to lift some weights.
Like you gotta you gotta use the Yoga 

2919
02:14:50,171 --> 02:14:50,240
Shit though,
isn't he?

2920
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:52,220
How much older is he denounced alone?

2921
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,170
How much older?
How much?

2922
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:56,960
I got to think Larry King's 85 years 
old.

2923
02:14:58,840 --> 02:14:59,230
Really?

2924
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,210
Stallone is what?
Sixty five.

2925
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:04,750
Oh,
he's 82.

2926
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:05,860
Wow.

2927
02:15:06,110 --> 02:15:08,980
Well it was great.
Why He's worth worth one point.

2928
02:15:08,981 --> 02:15:12,030
$5,000,000,000.
Wow.

2929
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:13,970
Holy Shit.
I didn't know he had that kind of

2930
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,300
bank.
Powerful Larry King.

2931
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:17,340
No wonder why he doesn't care if his 
wife cheats on them.

2932
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:18,660
It's like,
who gives a fuck?

2933
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:20,530
I'm over here coming on money.
Right.

2934
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:27,840
That's a lot of money.
He still works.

2935
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:29,520
Who likes it?
I guess loves it.

2936
02:15:29,521 --> 02:15:31,530
I saw him in the Sirius building one 
day.

2937
02:15:31,531 --> 02:15:36,531
I mean those weren't.
Not a lot of high profile shows there 

2938
02:15:36,531 --> 02:15:37,230
and he,
he's there doing interviews.

2939
02:15:38,030 --> 02:15:40,230
It's interesting guy that that's his 
wife.

2940
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:42,180
Yup.
Would you hit it

2941
02:15:43,090 --> 02:15:44,590
x rated,
cheating scale?

2942
02:15:44,591 --> 02:15:45,090
Not.
If he's.

2943
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:48,320
Don't go to that page.
How dare you?

2944
02:15:48,321 --> 02:15:49,960
You're about to click you little 
gossiper.

2945
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:57,100
When I was getting at is that like 
imagine working in a place where that's 

2946
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:59,280
all you're doing constantly.
Like what is that?

2947
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:05,840
Well,
it's almost like they just take darts 

2948
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:05,840
and they through.
They have two different targets in.

2949
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,580
One is the person and the other one is 
the activity will also day.

2950
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:13,800
They're allowed to make shit up.
All they have to say is a source told 

2951
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:13,800
us.
Yeah.

2952
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:16,210
That's all they have to say and they're 
protected sources.

2953
02:16:16,230 --> 02:16:21,230
Told us Adam Sandler was shoplifting.
Tells us that bet.

2954
02:16:21,841 --> 02:16:26,841
Midler is anorexic and they get sued.
All the time for making shit up.

2955
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,450
Don't fuck a scientologists because 
they,

2956
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:32,070
they come hard.
Do they come home?

2957
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:34,620
They went where they went after the Sun 
Times in uh,

2958
02:16:34,690 --> 02:16:37,480
in England with the Sun Times print.
Well,

2959
02:16:37,481 --> 02:16:39,700
there was,
I think Rupert Murdoch's company that he

2960
02:16:39,701 --> 02:16:44,701
was gay.
Well and scientology fucking took him 

2961
02:16:44,701 --> 02:16:45,100
home.
Yeah.

2962
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:46,990
How rude.

2963
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:54,220
You don't have the pockets say anything 
right now.

2964
02:16:55,120 --> 02:17:00,120
It's just so funny.
We should write a paper like that.

2965
02:17:01,060 --> 02:17:03,700
Just about comedians though.
How so?

2966
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:06,490
Just dirt on committees.
We'll make it up.

2967
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:08,110
Yeah.
What would we call it?

2968
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:11,640
Common Inquirer just ripped them off.
Yeah.

2969
02:17:11,641 --> 02:17:14,810
To find the link to the article.
But when you click on it,

2970
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:16,890
it's gone.
Last one.

2971
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:18,450
Oh Shit.
Which,

2972
02:17:18,490 --> 02:17:23,490
which article?
The scientologists even took down 

2973
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:24,820
articles about the lawsuit.
It's off the Sun Times.

2974
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:29,850
Websites will only probably sued sue the
shit out of somebody.

2975
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:37,260
The uh,
whatsapp Gawker went out of business 

2976
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:39,370
because of that one lawsuit.
Because little loves bunch we.

2977
02:17:39,371 --> 02:17:41,920
Yeah.
Because of a whole cogan his wife.

2978
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:45,730
But one lawsuit fucking mean was a big 
industry.

2979
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,580
Yeah.
One lawsuit took him down.

2980
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:50,950
Yeah.
Didn't they get hit for over 100 million

2981
02:17:50,951 --> 02:17:52,060
bucks?
Something like that.

2982
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:55,420
Just because they show it showed his 
cock 140 million.

2983
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:58,200
Was it a video or was it.
It was video.

2984
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:01,340
Video put up brand stories about it.
What were the videos?

2985
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:06,360
Also some like really defiant statements
like someone asked him about like 

2986
02:18:07,181 --> 02:18:09,200
underage girls,
like wasn't.

2987
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:10,870
What was the.
Wasn't there a question about that?

2988
02:18:10,970 --> 02:18:13,180
I think you said some about black guys 
or something whole Cogan?

2989
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:13,840
No,
no,

2990
02:18:13,841 --> 02:18:14,220
no,
not,

2991
02:18:14,221 --> 02:18:15,490
not that.
There was something else.

2992
02:18:15,491 --> 02:18:18,690
There was a different thing.
What I'm talking about is the wood.

2993
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:23,700
They asked him like,
at what age would you not release that 

2994
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:24,000
video?
Yeah.

2995
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:25,900
The guy who got sued,
the Gawker Guy.

2996
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:27,790
Oh yeah.
They uh,

2997
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:31,930
they asked him something and he gave 
this really defined response,

2998
02:18:32,530 --> 02:18:33,290
you know,
like I,

2999
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:34,360
I,
I'd fucking,

3000
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:35,650
I'd put it up,
I put it up,

3001
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:38,200
definitely put it up.
I forget what it was,

3002
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:40,120
but I remember listening to it like,
Ooh,

3003
02:18:40,121 --> 02:18:41,260
they're going to get this guy.

3004
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:43,840
You can't just do that.
You can't even,

3005
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:46,390
you can't even say you put an underage 
sex tape up.

3006
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:47,530
People are like,
Oh,

3007
02:18:47,531 --> 02:18:49,010
you're just out of control.
Yeah.

3008
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:51,430
What did he say?
Okay.

3009
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:52,970
Yeah,
he's down.

3010
02:18:52,971 --> 02:18:57,971
And uh,
and then they sued him personally to 

3011
02:18:57,971 --> 02:19:00,960
Hulk Hogan sued him personally for like 
35 million bucks and then sued Gawker 

3012
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,080
for like 100 and whatever,
million bucks.

3013
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:06,820
And then Bubba suit also magic bubba.
The love sponge coming after you.

3014
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:11,910
Holy Shit,
I'll give you whatever you want right 

3015
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,910
now.
His show,

3016
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:13,450
he's a good guy.
Fucking great.

3017
02:19:13,490 --> 02:19:18,490
It's great guy.
I did his show one time and I walk in 

3018
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:19,600
and I just come in on a red eye and I 
walk into the,

3019
02:19:19,601 --> 02:19:24,601
uh,
studio and it's out in the middle of 

3020
02:19:24,601 --> 02:19:28,080
nowhere.
It's like in the fucking brambles and 

3021
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:28,160
you go and it's like I've shack and you 
walk in and

3022
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,620
there's some pas and they're smoking a 
joint.

3023
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:34,190
They get me high.
Everybody's drinking pabst blue ribbon.

3024
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:39,250
There's a midget on the cow little 
person on the couch who's pissed 

3025
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:40,190
himself.
And I go inside.

3026
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:42,410
It was like,
it was like training day.

3027
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:43,930
I go inside and they,
uh,

3028
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Bubba pulls out a 12 gauge handgun and 
Israeli handgun and he starts waving it 

3029
02:19:49,701 --> 02:19:52,120
around and everybody fucking runs out of
the studio.

3030
02:19:52,121 --> 02:19:52,900
I go,
I go,

3031
02:19:52,901 --> 02:19:54,120
you just fucking around.
Right?

3032
02:19:54,370 --> 02:19:57,020
And then everybody runs out like babies 
not fucking around.

3033
02:19:57,410 --> 02:19:58,670
And he,
he had a,

3034
02:20:00,050 --> 02:20:05,050
he had a stripper or a whore in a van 
who drove up to like this corporate 

3035
02:20:05,301 --> 02:20:09,380
offices center and she was giving guys 
hand jobs for free,

3036
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:14,930
but they were playing the audio live on 
the air guys in suits and briefcases,

3037
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,900
getting handies in a sweaty,
windowless van.

3038
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:22,570
Wow.
Holy Shit is the best.

3039
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:27,720
Later asked by an attorney for Hogan.
If there was a situation which a 

3040
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:28,990
celebrity tape might not be newsworthy,
Doloria responded.

3041
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:34,020
If they were a child,
the attorneys then asked him to specify 

3042
02:20:34,020 --> 02:20:36,130
a child or under what age dollar Reno's 
responded for.

3043
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:41,510
No cases are won and lost on shit like 
that.

3044
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,200
It wasn't a bad hole cut in anyway.
I didn't think it was that young.

3045
02:20:47,201 --> 02:20:49,390
I thought I was.
I thought he was talking about like a 14

3046
02:20:49,391 --> 02:20:54,391
year old.
My brain was probably so disturbed by 

3047
02:20:54,391 --> 02:20:54,391
that.
I turned 14.

3048
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:59,110
That is disturbing it.
It's probably on coke.

3049
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,410
Let the guy go.
It's probably a doing antidepressants.

3050
02:21:02,650 --> 02:21:05,110
Lots of cocaine run into thing like 
Gawker.

3051
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:07,080
You got to be wired up.
Got To be on it.

3052
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Yeah.
It's like that guy who used to do the 

3053
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,480
um,
a spring break videos.

3054
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:17,050
Remember that guy?
Spring break videos.

3055
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:19,790
Girls Gone Wild.
Oh,

3056
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:22,230
February.
He was fucking wired till.

3057
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:25,620
Same kind of an operation.
Just couldn't stop,

3058
02:21:25,650 --> 02:21:30,650
couldn't get enough.
Couldn't say fuck you to the press and 

3059
02:21:30,650 --> 02:21:31,140
the public enough.
He was a renegade.

3060
02:21:31,410 --> 02:21:36,410
Well that guy was kidnapped in his house
and his house was broken into and you 

3061
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:37,950
got raped,
like a guy raped,

3062
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:42,120
raped him with a dildo because he had 
video taped his girlfriend or something.

3063
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:46,290
Probably something along those lines I 
think I heard of was a sister.

3064
02:21:46,291 --> 02:21:50,100
They got like sodomized the guy and made
him say some shit on video and so he did

3065
02:21:50,101 --> 02:21:51,420
something to this guy,
sister.

3066
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:54,390
I'll find this story.
Of course that's going to happen.

3067
02:21:54,391 --> 02:21:56,610
You live a life like that.
That's going to happen one day.

3068
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:59,150
Yeah,
it's probably going happen.

3069
02:21:59,910 --> 02:22:02,650
Will definitely happen.
Wow.

3070
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:05,070
Girls Gone Wild.
Remember that.

3071
02:22:05,071 --> 02:22:10,071
There was a moment where that was.
If like you try to do something like 

3072
02:22:10,071 --> 02:22:10,110
that today,
no one would give a fuck.

3073
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:11,700
You mean the,
the Internet.

3074
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:14,880
There's plenty of shit that you could 
watch.

3075
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:18,570
It's way more crazy than girls gone wild
that you would never have to pay for and

3076
02:22:18,571 --> 02:22:21,810
you wouldn't have to get releases for.
There was a brief window in time,

3077
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:25,980
a brief window where you could just run 
through and that ran through

3078
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:30,240
and sold videos that you could buy late 
night on a website.

3079
02:22:30,241 --> 02:22:35,241
Girls Gone Wild and you would watch 
these videos and people would pay for 

3080
02:22:35,241 --> 02:22:37,800
him to remember jerking off to the 
commercials.

3081
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:41,360
They were so guy broke into his house.
He pulled his pants down,

3082
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:43,200
strategically placed that Dildo in his 
ass.

3083
02:22:43,201 --> 02:22:48,201
Strategically,
I don't think there's a strategy 

3084
02:22:48,201 --> 02:22:48,201
involved,
folks.

3085
02:22:48,201 --> 02:22:49,350
You are really loosely using the word 
strategy.

3086
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:55,020
I've got a diagram and a,
there's a theory of Einstein's theory.

3087
02:22:55,890 --> 02:22:56,970
Whoa.
They found the guy,

3088
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:57,770
it says,
uh,

3089
02:22:57,771 --> 02:23:02,771
the,
the masked man who later turned out to 

3090
02:23:02,771 --> 02:23:03,090
be sexy in pr.
Why isn't sexy?

3091
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:08,570
Why has that sexy Hollywood con con man,
Darnell Riley then tried to blackmail 

3092
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:14,310
francis for up to $500,000
for the tape and he would have gotten 

3093
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:14,940
away with it too if it wasn't for Paris 
Hilton,

3094
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:17,790
who was also being blackmailed by Riley.
Wow.

3095
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:19,410
Holy Shit.
She was an idiot.

3096
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:24,410
Hooper friended him and he introduced 
him and introduced him to her social 

3097
02:23:24,410 --> 02:23:25,860
circle to begin with with Paris has 
help.

3098
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:31,010
Police were able to arrest Riley who 
copped a plea and is currently serving 

3099
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,190
eight years in prison for robbery and 
extortion.

3100
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:35,850
The irony is that he'll probably be a 
free man of for a few years,

3101
02:23:35,870 --> 02:23:40,870
in a few years while Francis will likely
be serving a term on tax evasion 

3102
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:40,870
charges.
What year is this?

3103
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:41,540
Just doesn't.
Eight.

3104
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:43,110
He's not in jail for that.
Oh,

3105
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:48,260
okay.
So this guy's out to the end of eight 

3106
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:48,260
years.
I wonder if some guys were strategically

3107
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:51,060
putting Dickson his ass.
Why they probably strategically.

3108
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:54,390
Why do you say this guy is a.
that's the whole thing is weird.

3109
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:59,960
So they.
They've met a con man and the con man 

3110
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:01,170
found out with Joe Francis lived and 
fucked him in the ass with a Dildo.

3111
02:24:01,710 --> 02:24:02,220
How rude.

3112
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:05,850
I'm speaking of Florida.
Can I plug my sweet guy?

3113
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:07,590
You did it.
Yeah,

3114
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:08,960
please do.
I,

3115
02:24:08,961 --> 02:24:13,961
uh,
we were talking before the show is this 

3116
02:24:13,961 --> 02:24:13,961
week.
You're doing that?

3117
02:24:13,961 --> 02:24:13,961
Um,
the water now.

3118
02:24:13,961 --> 02:24:15,390
A lot of data.
It's a great room,

3119
02:24:15,550 --> 02:24:20,550
a great room.
The eighth through the 10th of 

3120
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:20,550
September.
I'll be down there in room.

3121
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:20,550
It is,
it's,

3122
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:21,540
it's rowdy.
Yeah.

3123
02:24:21,541 --> 02:24:24,890
It's a fun Gig.
I'm not a big fan of a casinos now.

3124
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,730
We've talked about that before.
The show started,

3125
02:24:26,731 --> 02:24:29,250
like the Indian casinos and native 
American casinos.

3126
02:24:29,251 --> 02:24:31,820
They're dark to some.
Some bizarre about that.

3127
02:24:31,821 --> 02:24:36,821
Yeah.
And when you got to walk through that 

3128
02:24:36,821 --> 02:24:37,900
every night to get to the shell shell up
with a weird vibe you've absorbed.

3129
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:39,750
It was absorbed.
A lot of different energies.

3130
02:24:39,751 --> 02:24:44,751
Walked into that room.
I stayed at the hard rock last time I 

3131
02:24:44,751 --> 02:24:47,271
was in Orlando and this couple next to 
me was fucking the shit out of each 

3132
02:24:47,271 --> 02:24:47,271
other.

3133
02:24:47,271 --> 02:24:48,360
You could hear it.
It was great.

3134
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,090
Yeah.
This guy was laying some pipe.

3135
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:53,370
I wish I met him in the hallway.
I'll give him knuckles.

3136
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:58,580
Yeah,
but what if the door opened and he came 

3137
02:24:58,580 --> 02:24:58,580
at.
I was trying to find the book.

3138
02:24:58,580 --> 02:25:00,210
You won't fuck.
I'm weird.

3139
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:02,630
She's doing now.
Like he was.

3140
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:04,800
He was pounded eller.
Pam was like,

3141
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:06,600
Oh fuck.
Oh fuck.

3142
02:25:07,290 --> 02:25:09,570
Oh fuck.
Oh fuck you pay me.

3143
02:25:09,571 --> 02:25:10,560
I was like,
whoa.

3144
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:13,080
It was going on for quite a while,
so it was like,

3145
02:25:13,081 --> 02:25:16,890
this guy's really laying pipe.
That's fucking great.

3146
02:25:17,010 --> 02:25:18,360
Now.
He's definitely took vitamins.

3147
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:19,880
It was definitely a shape.
Yeah,

3148
02:25:20,060 --> 02:25:21,440
it's pounded her for awhile.
What?

3149
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:23,440
I was like,
there's something about that.

3150
02:25:23,470 --> 02:25:23,920
Well,
you're

3151
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:29,000
ever,
ever cat or cats will like hide under a 

3152
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:29,000
couch,
but their tails hanging out.

3153
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,050
That bitch I see you.
He'd pretend to you when someone's 

3154
02:25:34,271 --> 02:25:35,680
fucking in a hotel like that.
Yeah.

3155
02:25:35,681 --> 02:25:36,640
All right.
No one's around.

3156
02:25:36,650 --> 02:25:37,510
No.
Everybody can hear you.

3157
02:25:37,530 --> 02:25:39,370
Hey,
everybody can hear everything you say.

3158
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:40,720
Everybody can hear you.
You're.

3159
02:25:40,721 --> 02:25:43,180
You're basically broadcasting to the 
people above you.

3160
02:25:43,181 --> 02:25:46,000
Below you in to each side.
I've stood outside doors,

3161
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:51,110
I'll for sure I have.
I've walked that walk next door and 

3162
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:53,650
stood right outside the door solution.
You get the double door connecting rooms

3163
02:25:53,651 --> 02:25:56,560
and you open your door,
get it glass,

3164
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:59,290
pull your pants down.
Doom,

3165
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:00,040
doom,
doom,

3166
02:26:00,110 --> 02:26:00,930
doom,
doom,

3167
02:26:00,990 --> 02:26:01,830
doom,
doom.

3168
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,180
Also Cleveland.
The eighth through the 10th.

3169
02:26:04,210 --> 02:26:06,640
So what day is this Hollywood improv 
that's going to be the,

3170
02:26:06,641 --> 02:26:11,641
uh,
the first through the fourth of 

3171
02:26:11,641 --> 02:26:11,641
September this weekend.
Greg,

3172
02:26:11,641 --> 02:26:14,290
who are you working with?
A couple of white guys.

3173
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,910
If it's Florida,
I would imagine.

3174
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:19,360
Oh,
this white people in Florida.

3175
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:23,530
October of your new special White Castle
in Florida.

3176
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:29,290
A Cleveland September eighth through the
10th.

3177
02:26:29,291 --> 02:26:30,950
That hilarity.
He's good.

3178
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:31,540
Good,
good,

3179
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:32,320
good.
Good.

3180
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:33,820
Good restaurant.
Really?

3181
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:36,150
Nick Costis runs the place.
He makes the best,

3182
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:41,220
best,
best food of any comedy club in the 

3183
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:41,220
country.
That's strong words.

3184
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:41,220
Where else do you think there's good 
food?

3185
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:43,810
Like Lacey's comedy magic.
Oh yeah.

3186
02:26:43,811 --> 02:26:45,040
That's good.
It's excellent.

3187
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:46,420
It's a great restaurant,
right?

3188
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:48,310
Flappers.
Flappers.

3189
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:49,420
I haven't eaten a flat.
Oh yeah,

3190
02:26:49,421 --> 02:26:50,800
I did know.
I hated flappers once.

3191
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:52,530
Yeah,
yeah,

3192
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:54,270
yeah.
There's a few places now.

3193
02:26:54,750 --> 02:26:59,750
The improv try to do a barbecue joint.
They tried to have like fake fucking 

3194
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:01,610
fake old Westie Shit and colored the 
roadhouse they had like,

3195
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:06,760
like rusty saws on the wall and stuff 
like this theme come from.

3196
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:12,570
What are you doing?
What corporate meeting dreamed up this 

3197
02:27:12,570 --> 02:27:14,560
idea.
I know this isn't a farm more retarded.

3198
02:27:15,490 --> 02:27:20,490
It just puts me in the corner of.
In the room.

3199
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:23,610
What's on first?
Barbecues in.

3200
02:27:24,310 --> 02:27:26,830
Make sure the waitresses take one side 
of that.

3201
02:27:26,831 --> 02:27:29,380
Overall off,
she was drunk at the bar.

3202
02:27:29,381 --> 02:27:31,000
Like Jean.
What do you do in the wild west?

3203
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:38,890
What do you do out here and with the cow
pokes in our barbecue sandwiches.

3204
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:40,140
I don't know.
France,

3205
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:42,920
the old western bar.
This,

3206
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:48,350
this,
this boards weathered some old shitty 

3207
02:27:48,350 --> 02:27:51,871
wood.
There's a little hitching post out 

3208
02:27:54,391 --> 02:27:55,500
front.
Yeah.

3209
02:27:55,530 --> 02:27:58,900
You show up with some shoes that were 
professionally scuffed.

3210
02:27:58,901 --> 02:28:03,901
Yeah.
You brought them to these like poor 

3211
02:28:03,901 --> 02:28:04,750
immigrant children and they just threw 
rocks at your shoes.

3212
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,920
Yeah.
Go play soccer in these front.

3213
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,860
Our solute look like.
They're like,

3214
02:28:08,861 --> 02:28:11,710
you're a man of the world.
A worldly man.

3215
02:28:12,730 --> 02:28:17,440
Then don't forget a Calgary,
Calgary,

3216
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:18,670
Alberta.
Fucking love it up.

3217
02:28:18,671 --> 02:28:21,950
September 22 through 24 at Yuk.
Oh,

3218
02:28:21,951 --> 02:28:22,190
good

3219
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,390
gig.
Oh Shit.

3220
02:28:23,391 --> 02:28:24,440
Yeah,
that's a good gig.

3221
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:28,580
Is Fun.
Podcast festival on the 25th.

3222
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:30,480
Now this is going to be back in La.
Oh,

3223
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:33,500
on September 25th.
That'll do it.

3224
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:34,460
I'm like,
how you did that?

3225
02:28:34,461 --> 02:28:36,470
You went podcast festival for anything 
confusing.

3226
02:28:36,471 --> 02:28:39,200
You said people.
It gives them the thinking like,

3227
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:42,220
is this in Cleveland to right?
And then you say in La like,

3228
02:28:42,260 --> 02:28:44,030
oh no,
I have to rethink everything.

3229
02:28:44,390 --> 02:28:45,140
Oh,
it's in La.

3230
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:48,200
It's.
I try to take people on my journey.

3231
02:28:48,201 --> 02:28:53,201
Here's,
here's what my life is going to be for 

3232
02:28:53,201 --> 02:28:53,390
the next 30 days.
It's going to be lonely.

3233
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:58,450
It's going to be lonely.
You should bring guys in the room with 

3234
02:28:58,450 --> 02:28:58,450
you.
I know Cleveland.

3235
02:28:58,450 --> 02:29:01,370
I am Jff.
Harris has opened for me and Cleveland.

3236
02:29:01,371 --> 02:29:03,560
That'll be great.
You know that Guy Jeff Harris?

3237
02:29:03,561 --> 02:29:04,940
I probably met him.
Yeah.

3238
02:29:04,941 --> 02:29:08,780
Good guy.
Good guy or know we just moved here.

3239
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:11,780
He was where he was living in the 
Midwest.

3240
02:29:11,781 --> 02:29:16,781
I can't remember which city he was in.
There's so many new guys here now 

3241
02:29:16,781 --> 02:29:16,910
there's like a guy.
You see someone a couple of times like,

3242
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:18,980
ah dude,
what's up?

3243
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:19,700
Right.
You know,

3244
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:20,210
I know.
Yeah.

3245
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:22,040
What's up?
Like you've worked with them on the road

3246
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:22,490
or.
No,

3247
02:29:22,491 --> 02:29:25,100
you've seen him at the Improv or see 
there's like there's always new people,

3248
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,440
you know,
like the comedy business.

3249
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:32,920
As far as like the amount of comics,
I don't think there's ever been more of 

3250
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:32,920
us now.
Right.

3251
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:34,370
When you think,
well there's a ton of rooms,

3252
02:29:34,371 --> 02:29:36,020
there's a lot more people making a 
living at it,

3253
02:29:36,021 --> 02:29:37,090
that's for sure.
Yeah.

3254
02:29:37,430 --> 02:29:38,580
Which means there's more people that 
try.

3255
02:29:38,610 --> 02:29:40,970
Plus you've got like,
you've got that whole,

3256
02:29:41,070 --> 02:29:46,070
like you see b mechanism that creates 
comedy by making classes of people learn

3257
02:29:48,671 --> 02:29:53,671
comedy and then they all start going out
to the clubs and massive waves like 

3258
02:29:53,671 --> 02:29:58,170
fucking like crabs running into the 
ocean.

3259
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:00,970
Right?
Sea Turtles.

3260
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,300
Yeah.
There's a lot that escape and they don't

3261
02:30:04,301 --> 02:30:09,301
have real commitment.
They just are dealing with because like 

3262
02:30:09,301 --> 02:30:12,120
they've blocked out this time before 
they get a sitcom writing job or before 

3263
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:12,910
they go into a,
you know,

3264
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:17,940
auditioning for movies.
Like there's just this period that 

3265
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:17,940
they're going to do standup.
There is a.

3266
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:21,220
there's a thing that drives real comics 
crazy and it's that.

3267
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:26,410
Yeah.
Like guys like you guys like Marin 

3268
02:30:26,410 --> 02:30:29,971
brings that shit up.
Like there's a lot of guys get real 

3269
02:30:29,971 --> 02:30:30,100
upset.
I like people with alterior motives that

3270
02:30:30,101 --> 02:30:33,220
also do standup.
Like standup is a sacred thing.

3271
02:30:33,221 --> 02:30:36,370
That must be.
You must commit to yourself only to this

3272
02:30:36,371 --> 02:30:39,790
art.
I get some dark art,

3273
02:30:39,791 --> 02:30:44,791
like dad,
they're going to try it out for a while 

3274
02:30:44,791 --> 02:30:44,810
and then they're going to move on to 
other things.

3275
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:49,860
So it's fucking losers.
It's like I'm a middle aged woman in a 

3276
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:50,740
bar.
Some honky tonk and guys use me a lot.

3277
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:56,550
I just want.
I just want to meet a husband to good 

3278
02:30:56,550 --> 02:30:56,590
man.
I just don't know why.

3279
02:30:56,910 --> 02:31:01,910
How come?
Why not but fail or you coming in my 

3280
02:31:01,910 --> 02:31:02,810
mouth.
This is just not what I wanted.

3281
02:31:03,330 --> 02:31:04,780
I wanted.
I know it's what happened.

3282
02:31:05,530 --> 02:31:10,530
I'm not.
I pull my head off when you jam it back 

3283
02:31:10,530 --> 02:31:11,940
down.
Swollen love just.

3284
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:16,570
Well I'll give the head but I just want 
some kids to.

3285
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:18,000
It's too late,
baby,

3286
02:31:18,001 --> 02:31:19,140
or 56.
No,

3287
02:31:19,141 --> 02:31:19,590
no,
no,

3288
02:31:19,591 --> 02:31:20,070
no,
no.

3289
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,350
There's a moment in Russia.
She's 64 years old.

3290
02:31:22,351 --> 02:31:25,050
She just had a baby.
She had her first baby,

3291
02:31:25,051 --> 02:31:27,270
naturally natural childbirth to the 
Lord,

3292
02:31:27,271 --> 02:31:29,490
and she drank a lot of keifer.
He ever heard of that?

3293
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,020
It's a culture.
It's like a yogurt.

3294
02:31:31,410 --> 02:31:32,710
It's real good for you to justice 
system.

3295
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:35,850
It makes your rap as a baby.
I know.

3296
02:31:35,851 --> 02:31:39,270
I got three or four eggs left.
Had a period last summer,

3297
02:31:40,830 --> 02:31:42,600
be well.
It was a hemorrhage.

3298
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:45,590
Blood clot.
A cyst.

3299
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:50,660
Burst wasn't a period.
It was a polyp just dug deep hemorrhoid 

3300
02:31:52,981 --> 02:31:56,430
that leaked from her asshole into her 
vagina through the wall.

3301
02:31:57,210 --> 02:32:01,300
It's so such a heavy flow just pouring 
out Uracil,

3302
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:05,430
but she's sticking tampons.
Some residual,

3303
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:08,040
some of it.
I swear this came out of my vagina.

3304
02:32:08,041 --> 02:32:10,770
I think I've been feeling cranky.
I'm heavier than ever.

3305
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:12,780
Look,
I'm moody.

3306
02:32:12,781 --> 02:32:15,680
I am Diane [inaudible].
She just passed a fucking.

3307
02:32:15,850 --> 02:32:19,400
Your spleen ahead period.
Just came through.

3308
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:24,430
Uh,
but I used to date this fella and he had

3309
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:30,261
a hook like Dick and I think you wore a 
hole in the wall of my vagina with his 

3310
02:32:30,261 --> 02:32:33,900
Hook Dick and that is where the blood,
my vagina,

3311
02:32:33,901 --> 02:32:38,901
but just not coming out of my vagina.
But I'm definitely having my parents 

3312
02:32:41,770 --> 02:32:44,250
show up.
Took it in the ass last night real hard.

3313
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:49,250
But that's not why I'm bleeding.
That was my choice set my month.

3314
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:54,470
I just felt like give him a treat and 
then she would have she punches herself 

3315
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:57,630
so she can show them that she's 
bleeding.

3316
02:32:57,631 --> 02:32:58,170
No,
look,

3317
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:02,700
she's got pliers up there 10 minutes 
before.

3318
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:07,080
Did you see that video of that woman?
She was suing her ex fiance,

3319
02:33:07,081 --> 02:33:12,081
some billionaire character and they got 
video for beating the shit out of 

3320
02:33:12,081 --> 02:33:14,940
herself on the bed.
Put surveillance cameras in the bedroom.

3321
02:33:14,990 --> 02:33:19,990
Oh Shit.
She's wailing on her own face in the 

3322
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:19,990
bed.
Wow.

3323
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,790
Like wailing on ourselves.
That's awesome.

3324
02:33:23,150 --> 02:33:24,740
Screaming,
kicking weight.

3325
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:28,400
And who is the guy?
Some rich guy who's breaking it off with

3326
02:33:28,401 --> 02:33:29,210
her.
She's like,

3327
02:33:29,211 --> 02:33:31,000
Oh yeah,
motherfucker.

3328
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:33,050
Well,
what do you think?

3329
02:33:33,051 --> 02:33:35,420
Did you talk to Stan hope about that 
whole thing with?

3330
02:33:35,421 --> 02:33:36,260
Um,
yeah,

3331
02:33:36,261 --> 02:33:38,750
I did,
but honestly he on that.

3332
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:41,540
He wasn't there.
I'm stan hope.

3333
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,610
Uh,
he wasn't there when it all went down.

3334
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:44,140
You know,
if,

3335
02:33:44,150 --> 02:33:44,720
if,
if,

3336
02:33:44,870 --> 02:33:46,880
if he ever did really whack that chicken
the head.

3337
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,110
I don't know if he did,
I wasn't there.

3338
02:33:48,190 --> 02:33:50,180
Look at this girl with this.
Show it again,

3339
02:33:50,181 --> 02:33:55,181
Jamie,
but just show the beginning because the 

3340
02:33:55,181 --> 02:33:55,470
beginning is ridiculous.
Watches.

3341
02:33:56,580 --> 02:34:01,580
Oh my God.
She's insane.

3342
02:34:01,591 --> 02:34:04,560
And then she starts throwing these 
tantrums and then doing it again and she

3343
02:34:04,561 --> 02:34:07,170
does it a bunch of times.
Oh my God.

3344
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:11,790
She just keeps wailing on her own face 
and screaming and yelling.

3345
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:17,150
Dad,
that is a woman out of control and 

3346
02:34:17,150 --> 02:34:18,370
there's no one there.
She's doing that shit by herself.

3347
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:20,380
So she's making noise.
The neighbors will hear it.

3348
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:23,020
I don't know.
I don't know if she's doing that.

3349
02:34:24,390 --> 02:34:26,730
That's actually a smart move.
You open up all the windows,

3350
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:29,580
do it so the neighbors can hear it.
Beat the shit out of yourself.

3351
02:34:29,610 --> 02:34:31,290
Your neighbors called the cops.
You come out.

3352
02:34:31,291 --> 02:34:32,820
He left.
He just left five minutes ago.

3353
02:34:32,821 --> 02:34:35,040
You just messed up.
Wow.

3354
02:34:35,310 --> 02:34:37,470
Meanwhile,
he had surveillance cameras.

3355
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:41,500
You get to see darkness sometimes and 
things like that.

3356
02:34:41,501 --> 02:34:42,580
Woo.
That's dark.

3357
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:45,070
Yeah.
Ooh,

3358
02:34:45,370 --> 02:34:46,300
I got.
I got.

3359
02:34:46,350 --> 02:34:50,760
I beat myself up in jail once I was,
I got arrested for fighting and uh,

3360
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:53,560
the cops were being fucking assholes and
they wouldn't give me any food.

3361
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:54,850
And then,
uh,

3362
02:34:54,910 --> 02:34:59,910
and then he,
he reached in and grabbed my hair 

3363
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:00,910
because I was yelling at him and he 
bashed my head against the wall a couple

3364
02:35:00,911 --> 02:35:05,911
times and I wasn't bleeding.
So then I punched myself in the side of 

3365
02:35:05,911 --> 02:35:10,100
the mouth and I made myself plead and I 
got out and they just like check me out.

3366
02:35:10,130 --> 02:35:13,990
Nobody cared.
It wasn't like a big investigation.

3367
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:20,130
They just felt like did on my shirt,
like 16 clever fellow Wilson.

3368
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:25,180
It was a way to make this better.
I see an opening.

3369
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,750
I'm going to take the whole police force
down.

3370
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:31,930
He grabbed my fucking head.
I just can't prove it.

3371
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:34,060
Feel justified.
My embellishment.

3372
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:38,800
I bet there weren't cameras back then.
The cameras they did have.

3373
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:40,900
They just draw with crayons.
Yeah,

3374
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:46,220
they were terrible.
It's like a sonogram and I mean any 

3375
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:46,930
surveillance system from the 19 
eighties.

3376
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:52,260
Yeah.
Kinda shit film was that you were 

3377
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:52,790
looking at vhs tape and the 19 eighties.
Oh,

3378
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:55,540
you remember that movie Jamie?
That vhs movie,

3379
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:57,220
that horror movie that people told me 
about it.

3380
02:35:57,221 --> 02:35:59,200
That's awesome.
Do you ever see that movie?

3381
02:35:59,620 --> 02:36:01,990
The vhs.
It's like found footage.

3382
02:36:01,991 --> 02:36:02,830
Like,
look what we found,

3383
02:36:03,770 --> 02:36:04,600
uh,
the uh,

3384
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:07,390
something which projects or which 
products like that.

3385
02:36:07,690 --> 02:36:10,180
But vhs is just,
it's just a horror movie,

3386
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:12,460
but it has this one,
um,

3387
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:15,550
one segment of it,
there's like three or four segments,

3388
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:20,670
how many segments.
There's one segment was this girl this 

3389
02:36:20,670 --> 02:36:24,030
and she plays a this demon that really 
loves this guy and she's Kinda hot and 

3390
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:28,870
she meets this guy at a bar and she's 
just really strange and they get back to

3391
02:36:28,871 --> 02:36:29,840
a,
a,

3392
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:34,940
an apartment and they're all drinking 
and this guy starts banging her and she 

3393
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:35,290
turns into this demon and kills them 
all.

3394
02:36:35,410 --> 02:36:40,410
It's fucking wild.
And they've decided to make a whole 

3395
02:36:40,410 --> 02:36:43,240
movie is the best part of the series.
The vhs series by far.

3396
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:45,370
So they decided to make a whole movie of
it,

3397
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:47,680
of this one character.
Apparently it's out.

3398
02:36:47,950 --> 02:36:49,990
Is it called like sirens or something 
like that.

3399
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:55,660
The sirens was an Australian movie with 
is a bunch of those sirens movies.

3400
02:36:55,661 --> 02:37:00,661
But I think this movie is called Siren.
It might be siren and it might be on 

3401
02:37:00,661 --> 02:37:04,711
Netflix.
I can't imagine a deeper emotional 

3402
02:37:05,881 --> 02:37:09,480
change than fucking girl and having her 
turned into a monster that's killing.

3403
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:12,930
You know what I mean?
It's so well done.

3404
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:14,580
One second.
You're just,

3405
02:37:14,730 --> 02:37:14,970
you're

3406
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,900
and you're in your,
you're feeling confident.

3407
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:22,901
You're income.
Like sex is being in control as you're 

3408
02:37:22,901 --> 02:37:26,590
and you're making her feel a certain way
and then all of a sudden the fangs come 

3409
02:37:26,590 --> 02:37:27,860
out and you're,
you should dick shrinks.

3410
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:29,870
You got to get out of there.
Well,

3411
02:37:29,871 --> 02:37:31,490
that's part of the problem.
And the thing like,

3412
02:37:31,491 --> 02:37:32,990
she fucks this guy.
She's fucking him,

3413
02:37:32,991 --> 02:37:35,000
but she kills all his friends.
She likes him.

3414
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:36,470
She keeps saying,
I like you.

3415
02:37:36,990 --> 02:37:41,990
I like it when she goes to suck his Dick
and his dick is soft and she gets upset 

3416
02:37:41,990 --> 02:37:43,610
and she's covered in blood.
She was covered in blood sugar,

3417
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:48,640
giant teeth or head is grown,
so her forehead and split down the 

3418
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:51,431
middle or skin is split down the middle 
because her head is grown and she's got 

3419
02:37:51,431 --> 02:37:54,821
all these teeth and she's sucking his 
cock with its blood caked all over her 

3420
02:37:54,821 --> 02:37:54,821
face.

3421
02:37:54,821 --> 02:37:55,700
She was like,
no shit,

3422
02:37:55,701 --> 02:37:57,610
and she's like upset.
Why aren't you hard?

3423
02:37:58,110 --> 02:38:01,230
It's like porn.
No,

3424
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:01,580
no,
no.

3425
02:38:01,581 --> 02:38:06,581
You don't see it.
It's like from his perspective is like 

3426
02:38:06,581 --> 02:38:08,840
glasses on where he can see it.
Siren clip goes on the run and attacks.

3427
02:38:08,841 --> 02:38:11,450
What does that mean?
Yeah,

3428
02:38:11,451 --> 02:38:13,220
I think that's the movie.
Fuck.

3429
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:14,760
Which is the vhs?
Yeah,

3430
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:18,500
directed it releases in theaters.
December second 2016.

3431
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:20,960
David Bruckner video on demand to.
Okay.

3432
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:23,750
So it's going to be on demand December 
second.

3433
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:25,280
I hope it's good.
Play.

3434
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:30,310
Play like a little clip of it.
See if you can find a little clip of 

3435
02:38:30,310 --> 02:38:30,310
the,
uh,

3436
02:38:30,310 --> 02:38:31,600
the scene in vhs.
No,

3437
02:38:31,601 --> 02:38:36,601
not this one.
The original one and the original scene 

3438
02:38:36,601 --> 02:38:36,950
where there's the,
where the girls,

3439
02:38:36,951 --> 02:38:37,760
like,
I like you.

3440
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:40,430
There's like a clip of it if it's like a
trailer of it.

3441
02:38:40,431 --> 02:38:40,940
So this was,
uh,

3442
02:38:40,941 --> 02:38:41,510
this was,
uh,

3443
02:38:41,900 --> 02:38:44,030
did it get released or went straight to 
that release,

3444
02:38:44,031 --> 02:38:46,490
but the rest of the movie wasn't good.
Yeah.

3445
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:51,520
It's like this one part is really scary 
and it's fucked up and like wild and it 

3446
02:38:51,711 --> 02:38:56,711
gives you all these feelings and it 
lasts for 20 minutes or maybe a half an 

3447
02:38:56,751 --> 02:38:58,190
hour at the most.
But this is her,

3448
02:38:58,191 --> 02:38:59,850
like what?
They play it for it so you can hear it.

3449
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:03,010
It's really creepy.
Before she turned into a.

3450
02:39:06,510 --> 02:39:07,120
Oh,
it's just that,

3451
02:39:07,121 --> 02:39:12,121
that's it.
And she kept doing that to him and he's 

3452
02:39:12,121 --> 02:39:12,121
like,
yeah,

3453
02:39:12,121 --> 02:39:12,121
I like Youtube.
She's like,

3454
02:39:12,121 --> 02:39:12,121
God,
I can't.

3455
02:39:12,121 --> 02:39:16,990
And then as they got alone together and 
then on their friends and everyone's 

3456
02:39:16,990 --> 02:39:18,230
drinking and then when she turns into 
this demon and kills them all,

3457
02:39:18,231 --> 02:39:22,040
it's fucking horrific because it's all 
seen from the first person perspective.

3458
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:24,920
It's all seen from this guy's eyeglasses
that he's wearing.

3459
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:26,180
He's wearing these video.
That's her.

3460
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:27,710
That's her.
When she was sucking his dick.

3461
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:36,600
Wow.
He's freaking the fuck out.

3462
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:44,000
I was so good.
It was those Gary,

3463
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:46,820
you know,
demon seems stupid.

3464
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:49,010
It seems really stupid that something 
can turn into that,

3465
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:54,280
but look how bizarre is a black widow?
How bizarre is a spider that eats her 

3466
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:55,820
mate?
Yeah.

3467
02:39:55,850 --> 02:39:59,180
You know how bizarre is a lot of nature.
That's absolutely real.

3468
02:39:59,270 --> 02:40:01,160
Yeah.
There's a lot of weird shit out there in

3469
02:40:01,161 --> 02:40:02,890
nature of things changed.

3470
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:04,490
They morphed.
They become a different thing.

3471
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:09,580
Yeah.
If there was just a small percentage of 

3472
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:09,580
women that when you fucked him,
they became demons.

3473
02:40:10,610 --> 02:40:12,020
You don't.
You don't know.

3474
02:40:12,021 --> 02:40:17,021
You don't know.
You don't know until you get them hot 

3475
02:40:17,021 --> 02:40:19,640
and they're out there on the dance floor
and they're fucking really shaking it 

3476
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:19,640
because they can't wait to become a 
demon.

3477
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:21,360
Yeah.
They're really trying to draw you in.

3478
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:22,890
I like it.
I like it.

3479
02:40:23,130 --> 02:40:24,010
And you're like,
dude,

3480
02:40:24,130 --> 02:40:25,250
I'm telling you man.
No,

3481
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:27,570
she's Puerto Rican.
She doesn't speak English.

3482
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:30,840
That's a demon.
I'm telling you.

3483
02:40:30,841 --> 02:40:32,670
That's a demon.
Demon.

3484
02:40:32,671 --> 02:40:34,530
Six weeks.
There's no demons,

3485
02:40:34,531 --> 02:40:36,480
bro.
He got to take the chance,

3486
02:40:36,481 --> 02:40:38,540
but people still fuck.
Absolutely.

3487
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:41,640
With guys still get drunk and take 
random women home that say,

3488
02:40:41,641 --> 02:40:46,641
I like you.
There would be girls that would pretend 

3489
02:40:46,641 --> 02:40:46,641
to be demon so they can get guys.
It'd be like,

3490
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:51,770
you never heard that some gay guys 
become a bug catchers or bug chasers 

3491
02:40:51,770 --> 02:40:52,770
where they try to get HIV.

3492
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:54,870
No Shit.
Never heard of that.

3493
02:40:55,080 --> 02:41:00,080
No.
It was like a real phenomenon and the 

3494
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:02,061
gay community were like reckless gay.
Single guys would actively try to get 

3495
02:41:02,061 --> 02:41:03,520
HIV for fun.
No Shit.

3496
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:08,690
Obviously this is not representative of 
the entire gay community and I'm not 

3497
02:41:08,690 --> 02:41:10,450
being any way discriminatory.
What I'm saying is that these,

3498
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,540
these are real people that actually did 
this because people.

3499
02:41:12,541 --> 02:41:14,820
Very people are nuts.
Well,

3500
02:41:14,821 --> 02:41:18,270
if there was a demon because it was just
one small percentage of the population,

3501
02:41:18,271 --> 02:41:21,000
it's less than one percent of one 
percent.

3502
02:41:21,050 --> 02:41:23,430
Yeah.
If you meet a thousand people,

3503
02:41:23,431 --> 02:41:25,600
one of them's a demon.
What are the odds?

3504
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:28,830
I dated a girl whose boyfriend died of 
AIDS.

3505
02:41:29,130 --> 02:41:30,030
Oh,
same thing.

3506
02:41:30,470 --> 02:41:32,490
East condoms.
Demon aids.

3507
02:41:32,570 --> 02:41:35,850
Same thing.
Use condoms because he died of AIDS.

3508
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:36,770
Yeah.
Whoa.

3509
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:39,690
Like she might have caught it from him.
Well,

3510
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:42,570
did you get nervous now?
Didn't think about it.

3511
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:48,080
When you think about it,
getting aids or getting ebola or 

3512
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:51,240
syphilis is lot like having a demon in 
you.

3513
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:52,800
Yeah,
like this thing,

3514
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:56,070
it's a living thing.
You're hosting this entity that's trying

3515
02:41:56,071 --> 02:41:59,040
to consume you.
You have too much energy.

3516
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:03,690
I feel like it's not going to suck your 
Dick and bite your balls off,

3517
02:42:03,691 --> 02:42:08,400
but it's just like you invited it in 
slowly and you buy it in through a bus.

3518
02:42:08,730 --> 02:42:12,870
Yeah,
little drunk.

3519
02:42:12,871 --> 02:42:15,910
She had acute feet.
That'll brown ones.

3520
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:20,670
Next thing you know.
Oh,

3521
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:24,070
and then you go to pee.
Fuck is going on.

3522
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:26,310
What is going on?
Why is my Dick hard?

3523
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:29,580
Fuck my records says nothing.
It's nothing.

3524
02:42:29,581 --> 02:42:31,290
Don't be.
Don't be scared to just being God you're

3525
02:42:31,291 --> 02:42:32,490
so.
She looked fine.

3526
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:34,830
She didn't look sick.
Don't be paranoid,

3527
02:42:34,831 --> 02:42:39,831
man.
Then you got to work for a couple days 

3528
02:42:39,831 --> 02:42:39,831
like,
why am I sweating?

3529
02:42:39,831 --> 02:42:39,831
Am I sweating?
Is it hot in here?

3530
02:42:39,831 --> 02:42:39,831
Is it hot in here?
No,

3531
02:42:39,831 --> 02:42:42,150
it's freezing.
It's office is freezing.

3532
02:42:42,510 --> 02:42:44,880
I feel hot shit like,
okay.

3533
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:46,580
I think I'm okay.
God,

3534
02:42:46,750 --> 02:42:48,560
I'm so tired.
Let me check my voice.

3535
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:49,860
I'm so tired.
I like you.

3536
02:42:50,190 --> 02:42:51,610
Yeah.
Voicemails.

3537
02:42:51,630 --> 02:42:56,630
I like you just slowly but surely the 
thing eats your body away and isn't that

3538
02:42:57,031 --> 02:42:58,530
how I'm.
Al Capone died.

3539
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:03,950
He died from syphilis.
Did I believe so from everybody not die 

3540
02:43:07,201 --> 02:43:08,280
for Vd,
you know,

3541
02:43:08,281 --> 02:43:13,281
like you watch,
you watch game of thrones or any of 

3542
02:43:13,281 --> 02:43:15,501
these things and just reminds you of 
like back then nobody use a condom and 

3543
02:43:15,501 --> 02:43:17,110
they went to whorehouses constantly.

3544
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:23,100
What color gained gave me pussy smell.
Pussy ass hole combo smell too.

3545
02:43:24,761 --> 02:43:27,310
People have back then.
No running water.

3546
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:28,760
Oh,
Al Capone.

3547
02:43:28,761 --> 02:43:33,761
Spent the last year of Zach trust 
sentence would had been reduced to six 

3548
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:35,770
years and five months for a combination 
of good behavior and work credits in the

3549
02:43:35,771 --> 02:43:37,900
hospital section being treated for 
syphilis.

3550
02:43:37,980 --> 02:43:40,510
Oh,
he was released.

3551
02:43:41,480 --> 02:43:46,480
He slowly deteriorated while staying at 
his palm island estate in Miami on 

3552
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:48,520
January 25th,
1947.

3553
02:43:48,521 --> 02:43:50,590
He died of cardiac arrest.
So yeah,

3554
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:51,750
syphilis got them.
Huh?

3555
02:43:52,270 --> 02:43:54,100
You know,
that's a slow demon.

3556
02:43:54,670 --> 02:43:56,020
Is it syphilis?
So,

3557
02:43:56,190 --> 02:43:58,450
but it's a demon.
It's like it's the same thing.

3558
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:00,670
Yeah.
I mean it's not going to talk to you.

3559
02:44:00,671 --> 02:44:05,671
It doesn't come from hell.
But it comes from here and it does the 

3560
02:44:05,671 --> 02:44:05,800
same job,
just takes a different form and it's not

3561
02:44:05,801 --> 02:44:10,801
as terrifying to us for some reason.
But if as many people died from demons 

3562
02:44:10,801 --> 02:44:13,810
has died from the flu,
we'd be shitting our pants every day,

3563
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:16,780
like thousands of people in this country
die from the flu.

3564
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:19,070
Nobody's out there freaking out.
It's like,

3565
02:44:19,090 --> 02:44:21,800
imagine if you go to cvs and get an anti
demon shot.

3566
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:28,360
The same amount of people,
the same amount of people who died from 

3567
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:32,281
the flu data demons there.
They have like garlic rings at the 

3568
02:44:32,281 --> 02:44:35,941
store.
You have to go and throw them on and 

3569
02:44:35,941 --> 02:44:35,941
there's crosses everywhere you go.
Yeah.

3570
02:44:35,941 --> 02:44:40,420
We would be in a state of terror if,
if demons killed as many people as colds

3571
02:44:40,421 --> 02:44:42,040
do.
Right.

3572
02:44:42,190 --> 02:44:45,940
And it's all through sex.
Like with the cold.

3573
02:44:45,941 --> 02:44:48,460
He didn't even get laid.
You just got something on a subway.

3574
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:49,390
Well,
yeah,

3575
02:44:49,391 --> 02:44:51,130
I mean what percent.
Okay.

3576
02:44:51,131 --> 02:44:53,050
Let's,
let's take a guess here.

3577
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:58,350
How many people ever like over the 
course of human history have died from 

3578
02:44:58,350 --> 02:44:58,720
vd?
How many?

3579
02:44:58,721 --> 02:45:00,430
Millions of people?
Millions.

3580
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:02,300
A hundred million.
$100.

3581
02:45:02,301 --> 02:45:03,670
Million.
I think you're probably right.

3582
02:45:04,030 --> 02:45:08,920
Let's say 100 million people have died 
from venereal disease worldwide.

3583
02:45:09,250 --> 02:45:13,300
How many people think it is every year?
How many people is like hit a year?

3584
02:45:13,330 --> 02:45:14,650
Syphilis,
Shit like that.

3585
02:45:14,651 --> 02:45:15,100
Kill.
Well,

3586
02:45:15,130 --> 02:45:17,200
AIDS is still tearing up to third world.

3587
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:22,990
A million.
A million worldwide every year.

3588
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:27,200
That might be high.
Few hundred thousand dollars.

3589
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:30,280
It certainly wasn't in the aids.
I don't have no.

3590
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:31,750
Honestly,
now that I'm saying this,

3591
02:45:31,751 --> 02:45:33,400
I'm realizing I'm totally talking out of
my ass.

3592
02:45:33,401 --> 02:45:38,230
I have no knowledge of what the actual 
numbers of the aids crisis where I had a

3593
02:45:38,231 --> 02:45:43,231
guy on my podcast a long time ago who is
a biology at the University of 

3594
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:49,920
California,
Berkeley and he does not believe that 

3595
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:53,221
HIV causes aids and of all the people 
that I've ever had on my podcast that 

3596
02:45:53,221 --> 02:45:57,370
created more like people angry at me and
controversy.

3597
02:45:57,730 --> 02:46:00,580
I just wanted to talk to the guy because
I don't understand the argument.

3598
02:46:00,670 --> 02:46:05,670
I don't understand how one person can 
have this point of view that all these 

3599
02:46:05,670 --> 02:46:05,920
other scientists and biologists don't 
have.

3600
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:08,820
What the fuck is that guy's name?
Downer?

3601
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:11,360
Well,
the president of South Africa,

3602
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:13,730
does this believe that HIV causes aids.

3603
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,140
You has names.
Duesberg.

3604
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:18,740
Touche Bird Duesberg.
Duesberg said German gentleman.

3605
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:24,100
And uh,
what he believed is that it was a 

3606
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:26,381
competent.
He said that I'm doing a shitty job 

3607
02:46:26,381 --> 02:46:26,840
paraphrase,
but what are you saying?

3608
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:28,960
I know I clear my throat too much.
I'm gonna.

3609
02:46:28,970 --> 02:46:31,340
Stop America want people that are 
listening.

3610
02:46:31,470 --> 02:46:33,860
A lot of the old radio shea butter 
coffee.

3611
02:46:33,861 --> 02:46:35,300
I don't want to admit it because I love 
it,

3612
02:46:35,301 --> 02:46:38,540
but I've got to stop drinking it.
Let's just drink water for podcast.

3613
02:46:38,570 --> 02:46:43,570
It's annoying.
It's annoying to me and I'm clearing my 

3614
02:46:43,570 --> 02:46:43,570
own throat.
Anyway,

3615
02:46:43,570 --> 02:46:48,250
I think it's part of your chart.
This Duesberg Fella thought that it was 

3616
02:46:48,250 --> 02:46:52,331
a good idea to tell everybody that uh,
HIV was actually a weak virus and that 

3617
02:46:53,810 --> 02:46:58,810
it was a symptom of a deteriorated 
immune system rather than the cause of 

3618
02:46:58,810 --> 02:46:58,810
it.
A deer have a,

3619
02:46:58,810 --> 02:47:03,180
created a real immune system and he 
believed that the cause of the 

3620
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:06,911
deteriorated immune system was a bunch 
of different recreational drugs these 

3621
02:47:07,821 --> 02:47:08,600
guys would take.

3622
02:47:08,750 --> 02:47:13,750
And then there's a disproportionate 
amount of these men from these areas is 

3623
02:47:14,091 --> 02:47:17,080
parts of town where they were doing a 
lot of drugs and how to have sex.

3624
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:22,110
Yeah,
email nitrate and crystal meth and all 

3625
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:24,431
this different stuff,
which is apparently amyl nitrate in 

3626
02:47:24,431 --> 02:47:27,491
particular.
All that stuff's apparently devastating 

3627
02:47:27,491 --> 02:47:29,561
to your immune system.
And so it was his belief that the HIV 

3628
02:47:29,781 --> 02:47:34,781
aspect of it was just a symptom of a 
deteriorated immune system from drugs 

3629
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:36,440
and that they were saying that that 
caused it.

3630
02:47:36,441 --> 02:47:40,160
But how the fuck can you sneak that by 
all these different scientists?

3631
02:47:40,161 --> 02:47:45,161
It just doesn't make sense.
Like I obviously don't understand the 

3632
02:47:45,161 --> 02:47:46,550
argument and he is a tenured professor 
at the University of California,

3633
02:47:46,551 --> 02:47:49,430
Berkeley and apparently he's made great 
strides and cancer research.

3634
02:47:49,431 --> 02:47:51,440
He's actually a very,
very intelligent guy.

3635
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:55,130
But when one guy has like a theory like 
this and everybody else's like,

3636
02:47:55,131 --> 02:47:57,560
fuck you,
like this guy to be.

3637
02:47:57,740 --> 02:48:00,290
It's just doesn't seem like it could be 
possibilities.

3638
02:48:00,291 --> 02:48:01,450
Right.
Does that.

3639
02:48:01,460 --> 02:48:03,260
I don't know.
I don't understand it,

3640
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:07,580
but it doesn't make sense to me that one
guy has figured this out and that.

3641
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:10,310
So when I had them on match,
people got so angry.

3642
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:11,330
Yeah,
I think it's so.

3643
02:48:11,331 --> 02:48:12,740
And it's a perfect guest.
They're like,

3644
02:48:12,741 --> 02:48:13,880
blood is on your hands.
I'm like,

3645
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:18,110
well now he's a tenured professor at an 
Ivy League school.

3646
02:48:18,111 --> 02:48:20,540
I think he can bring them on.
I got news for you.

3647
02:48:20,630 --> 02:48:22,550
If you take it in the ass because of 
this podcast,

3648
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:24,920
you're going to take it to the ass 
anyway.

3649
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:26,950
So don't tell me.
Yeah,

3650
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:31,670
fucking raise.
And you were already had amyl nitrate in

3651
02:48:31,671 --> 02:48:34,400
your hand.
You're ready is no way.

3652
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:37,820
I am swaying your decision to get but 
fucked up condom.

3653
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:42,970
I am not.
You take responsibility for your own 

3654
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:42,970
actions.

3655
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:42,970
You son of a,
b,

3656
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:44,390
you standing in the gay woods.
Come on.

3657
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:48,290
Listen to the podcast on earbuds.
How ridiculous is that idea?

3658
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:49,170
Yeah.
Well I,

3659
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:54,190
I wanted to know.
I mean someone said that you should do 

3660
02:48:54,190 --> 02:48:57,221
it with a qualified medical professional
so that you could have someone to 

3661
02:48:57,221 --> 02:49:00,221
counteracts as claims.
That is a very good point and one I 

3662
02:49:00,221 --> 02:49:04,151
probably should have taken into 
consideration and I probably would try 

3663
02:49:04,151 --> 02:49:06,821
to do that today,
but back then mean this is many years 

3664
02:49:06,821 --> 02:49:11,260
ago when I was doing the podcasts,
I couldn't believe the guy even wanted 

3665
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:11,260
to talk to me and I was like,
this is going to be great.

3666
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:15,710
I always wanting to know what this 
fucking crazy dude believes because 

3667
02:49:15,710 --> 02:49:15,780
everybody would always tell you to do.
You've read Duesberg.

3668
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:18,690
He had a thing in spin magazine.
HIV doesn't cause aids,

3669
02:49:18,691 --> 02:49:20,940
Bro.
I was like this article in Spin magazine

3670
02:49:20,941 --> 02:49:23,040
I read,
which was um,

3671
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:28,400
wasn't that the Penthouse Guy?
Didn't he have something to do with 

3672
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:28,400
Larry Flynt?
That's hustler.

3673
02:49:28,860 --> 02:49:30,150
Yeah.
Anyway,

3674
02:49:30,480 --> 02:49:35,480
there was this article in it about 
Duesberg and about HIV and I remember 

3675
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:37,940
reading ankle and is this even possible?
Is it possible?

3676
02:49:39,240 --> 02:49:44,240
Those things are really sketchy and 
dangerous for people like Uri who 

3677
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:44,240
doesn't know Jack Shit about the human 
body,

3678
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:46,590
but does.
How much do you know about diseases?

3679
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:49,390
Very little.
I know I got gonorrhea once.

3680
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:50,790
Did you?
Yeah,

3681
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,760
and in my mom's car and I went to this 
club,

3682
02:49:54,820 --> 02:49:59,820
went to this nightclub and I saw the 
classic fucking move out of a movie out 

3683
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:03,391
of a John Hughes movie.
I see a guy hitting on a girl and he's 

3684
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:04,390
really annoying her.
So I walk up and I go,

3685
02:50:04,391 --> 02:50:09,391
skews me,
do you mind if I talked to my 

3686
02:50:09,391 --> 02:50:11,791
girlfriend?
And the Guy Kinda just nods and walks 

3687
02:50:11,791 --> 02:50:13,210
away and she looks at me like a fucking 
halo comes over my head.

3688
02:50:13,810 --> 02:50:18,810
Half hour later I'm fucking her in the 
back of my mind that I mean like dad and

3689
02:50:19,651 --> 02:50:20,320
uh,
you know,

3690
02:50:20,350 --> 02:50:23,220
pounding,
pounding away and uh,

3691
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:25,330
you know,
real real,

3692
02:50:25,331 --> 02:50:30,331
like to sexual,
like she was more into it than I was 

3693
02:50:30,331 --> 02:50:30,331
almost nice.
So then,

3694
02:50:30,331 --> 02:50:31,510
um,
I go home that night,

3695
02:50:31,511 --> 02:50:36,511
I sleep maybe three hours and then I get
up the next morning to go caddy and I'm 

3696
02:50:36,571 --> 02:50:39,370
out on the course and I mean,
is that fast?

3697
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:42,750
By noon I get a burning sensation.
I stopped at the ninth,

3698
02:50:42,751 --> 02:50:47,751
we'll shack to take a piss and it was 
like acid coming out of my penis and I 

3699
02:50:48,401 --> 02:50:50,860
got in.
I had a fever of like 103.

3700
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:56,010
I had green muck in my underwear and I 
went to the hospital and they gave.

3701
02:50:57,800 --> 02:50:59,440
They diagnosed it immediately.
They're like,

3702
02:50:59,441 --> 02:51:01,270
you got gonorrhea,
you got the clap.

3703
02:51:01,271 --> 02:51:06,271
Buddy gave me a huge shot of penicillin 
in the ass and it went away.

3704
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:08,860
Just went home and slept.
Woke up was gone,

3705
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:14,650
but then the girl who worked in medical 
records at the hospital lived in town.

3706
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:20,090
She was my age,
fucking told everybody I had gone to.

3707
02:51:20,450 --> 02:51:25,450
I couldn't get laid for like a year.
She

3708
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:35,480
lock me for a year.
In all fairness though,

3709
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:36,500
you would have done the same.

3710
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:42,960
You only got to tell one person if you 
found out that she had Galleria,

3711
02:51:46,910 --> 02:51:48,200
girls wouldn't even make out

3712
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:49,900
mate.
I was like,

3713
02:51:49,910 --> 02:51:54,910
fuck yeah man.
Any reason to keep away from you when 

3714
02:51:54,911 --> 02:51:58,030
you're young.
Kids are ruthless and when they how they

3715
02:51:58,050 --> 02:52:03,050
bought,
dumping and re gather their 

3716
02:52:03,050 --> 02:52:03,050
relationships back up again.
Alright God,

3717
02:52:03,050 --> 02:52:06,040
they're ruthless in how they break up 
with each other or how they shun one.

3718
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,920
They'll kick one fucking duckling with a
limp.

3719
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:12,100
The shit out of that duck kicking into 
the pond.

3720
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:15,530
Fuck you look forward to like kicking 
someone out.

3721
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:18,130
Don't ever fuck that guy again.
You don't have to tell me.

3722
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:23,450
Right.
And those girls are so vulnerable at 

3723
02:52:23,450 --> 02:52:25,531
that age too.
And if you somehow or another work you 

3724
02:52:25,531 --> 02:52:28,321
way back in just to keep it a secret and
we have to keep a secret that we're 

3725
02:52:28,321 --> 02:52:28,321
seeing each other.
Yeah.

3726
02:52:28,321 --> 02:52:28,321
Like it's.
And you know,

3727
02:52:28,321 --> 02:52:30,580
after a while no one's going to care 
anymore but they can't right now.

3728
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:32,140
Yeah.
They can't right now.

3729
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:35,470
And you have to sneak in just to go on 
dates with other guys.

3730
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:40,680
She goes on dates with other guys and 
says she feels like shit and she goes 

3731
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:40,680
home early and then she fucks you.
Yeah,

3732
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:42,500
like barely.
She's wondering why she's doing it.

3733
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:47,640
She's waiting for one guy to come along 
that she goes on a date with earlier 

3734
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:47,640
that it's like preferred to you.
Yeah.

3735
02:52:47,830 --> 02:52:49,270
Right now you're like barely hanging in 
there.

3736
02:52:50,010 --> 02:52:55,010
Yeah.
You're just the second year you're 

3737
02:52:55,010 --> 02:52:55,010
almost on the bench.
Gonorrhea boy.

3738
02:52:58,450 --> 02:53:00,730
Fucking disease can change the course of
your life.

3739
02:53:00,780 --> 02:53:05,780
Right?
Like that could have just changed your 

3740
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:07,771
confidence.
You don't want to bet it did for the 

3741
02:53:07,771 --> 02:53:07,771
better.
I'm sure it does.

3742
02:53:07,771 --> 02:53:11,490
I'm thinking about that.
I think it made me more cautious about 

3743
02:53:11,490 --> 02:53:11,490
condoms.
I'll tell you that,

3744
02:53:11,490 --> 02:53:14,970
that,
and I also bet it helped you deal with 

3745
02:53:14,970 --> 02:53:14,970
like,
like the,

3746
02:53:14,970 --> 02:53:19,770
the inevitable moment on stage where you
say things that people don't think it's 

3747
02:53:19,770 --> 02:53:19,960
funny and you have to kind of have some 
personal sovereignty.

3748
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah,
that's a good way to develop personal 

3749
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:25,000
sovereignty.
You become an outcast.

3750
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:25,390
Girls.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

3751
02:53:25,470 --> 02:53:25,990
And you're like,
hey,

3752
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:29,050
I have a mirror.
I know I'm not a fucking freak.

3753
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:32,230
Like what's going on here?
Like this is bullshit.

3754
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:34,000
Yeah.
And then forcing your way back.

3755
02:53:34,001 --> 02:53:35,410
You're handsome little fella when you 
were young.

3756
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:36,600
That's all right.
So what'd you had?

3757
02:53:36,610 --> 02:53:37,810
Hair.
Full head of hair.

3758
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:40,950
Bright Smile.
Clean deck after awhile.

3759
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:42,340
Oh,
I used to quit.

3760
02:53:42,350 --> 02:53:44,140
Quit,
quit.

3761
02:53:44,141 --> 02:53:46,210
Quit it.
He's got a good vocabulary.

3762
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:49,480
He's a sharp kid that fitzsimmons sharp 
as a tack.

3763
02:53:49,630 --> 02:53:53,680
He's at the cow loon and Sagas up route 
one.

3764
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:57,310
Me and sally went to see him uproot one 
who's fucking hilarious.

3765
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:59,980
Do you knew how I stumbled across a 
tweet the other day,

3766
02:54:00,010 --> 02:54:00,970
Larry?
We're poochie.

3767
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:03,940
Oh yeah.
Probably a good tweet.

3768
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Well,
I think it was what it was was I was on 

3769
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Tim Macintyre's twitter.
I was like searching,

3770
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:09,400
you know,
Tim mcintire,

3771
02:54:09,401 --> 02:54:14,401
Boston comic.
I was on his twitter feed for whatever 

3772
02:54:14,401 --> 02:54:17,551
reason.
I was bored and I'm reading some funny 

3773
02:54:17,551 --> 02:54:18,010
shit that he had an interesting stuff 
and you know,

3774
02:54:18,011 --> 02:54:20,620
you do that.
You go on like a little twitter timeline

3775
02:54:20,950 --> 02:54:22,760
thing.
And I ran across a,

3776
02:54:23,050 --> 02:54:27,580
it looked like a facebook message from 
Larry Ripu who when we were kids when we

3777
02:54:27,581 --> 02:54:28,180
were starting out.

3778
02:54:28,180 --> 02:54:31,630
Larry was kind of a legendary character 
in Boston.

3779
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:32,430
Who,
uh,

3780
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:33,880
was he,
he got a,

3781
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:36,490
like a full time gig with nick's comedy.
Stop.

3782
02:54:36,491 --> 02:54:38,560
We're all.
He worked with Nick's comedy stop gigs.

3783
02:54:38,561 --> 02:54:41,170
He was one of those few guys,
a few guys that got that package.

3784
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:46,200
Remember they gave him like 500 bucks a 
week and they would just work them to 

3785
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:49,561
death if you do what?
But he knew that 500 bucks is coming in 

3786
02:54:49,561 --> 02:54:49,561
every week and never had to worry about 
work.

3787
02:54:49,561 --> 02:54:52,180
He worked and he was so loose because of
it goes.

3788
02:54:52,181 --> 02:54:54,340
He was like,
it was in the.

3789
02:54:54,370 --> 02:54:56,560
Allowed them to do other gigs too 
because I know I did.

3790
02:54:57,270 --> 02:54:58,780
I know I did some other gigs with him 
too.

3791
02:54:58,781 --> 02:55:00,700
That may not even nick's comedy stop 
gigs,

3792
02:55:00,850 --> 02:55:04,910
but for the most part he worked for them
and he was such a character.

3793
02:55:04,990 --> 02:55:09,990
Yeah.
So I had like a mullet and a belly and 

3794
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:11,630
he would strip down to a bikini at the 
end of his act.

3795
02:55:11,950 --> 02:55:14,330
Didn't he have like a regular job too 
for a long time?

3796
02:55:14,360 --> 02:55:16,330
I'm sure.
Like post office or something,

3797
02:55:16,340 --> 02:55:17,410
something like that.
Yeah,

3798
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:22,730
that place,
man,

3799
02:55:23,270 --> 02:55:26,840
I don't want to live there right now.
It's like I don't want to do that in the

3800
02:55:26,841 --> 02:55:29,360
winter now.
God Damn was a fun place to grow up.

3801
02:55:29,390 --> 02:55:30,560
Yeah,
it was.

3802
02:55:31,070 --> 02:55:34,760
Because if you weren't performing,
he were watching good comedy.

3803
02:55:34,761 --> 02:55:37,480
So one night that was a good night out.
It's amazing.

3804
02:55:37,481 --> 02:55:39,470
Like as adults,
when we're looking back on it,

3805
02:55:39,530 --> 02:55:44,530
how it looks stupid,
like you literally couldn't ask for a 

3806
02:55:44,530 --> 02:55:47,981
better place.
We found the best place that the best 

3807
02:55:47,981 --> 02:55:47,981
time.
Right.

3808
02:55:47,981 --> 02:55:51,640
So almost like if you are in some sort 
of a simulated reality and you wanted 

3809
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:52,450
to,
uh,

3810
02:55:52,820 --> 02:55:57,820
do the dream of a struggling but 
eventually becoming a professional 

3811
02:55:57,820 --> 02:55:59,440
standup comic,
where do you want to start?

3812
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:04,460
I want to start out in the golden days 
of comedy in the 20th century and I want

3813
02:56:04,581 --> 02:56:07,790
to make a living out of the gate.
I'm going to drop you off in Boston.

3814
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:12,860
He's going to be cold.
The winter is going to give you 

3815
02:56:12,860 --> 02:56:12,860
something to bitch about.
People have short attention spans.

3816
02:56:12,860 --> 02:56:16,900
They want you to give it to them quick.
They have very little patience for 

3817
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:17,030
bullshit.
You couldn't be indulgent.

3818
02:56:17,300 --> 02:56:19,640
There was no room for indulgence,
you know,

3819
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:22,460
made you really appreciate it.
Attention spans.

3820
02:56:22,850 --> 02:56:24,320
It's fucking freezing outside,
dude.

3821
02:56:24,350 --> 02:56:25,420
Get to the point.
Yeah.

3822
02:56:27,350 --> 02:56:29,450
And it was like you were given the 
opportunity,

3823
02:56:29,660 --> 02:56:33,680
but then like you could get stage time 
and you could get seen,

3824
02:56:33,681 --> 02:56:36,770
but to really work,
you had to fucking command the stage.

3825
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:40,340
He had to do your time.
You had to consistently perform.

3826
02:56:40,341 --> 02:56:44,210
It was like all these things that just 
made you get your 10,000

3827
02:56:44,211 --> 02:56:46,580
hours as Malcolm Gladwell says,
like that was,

3828
02:56:46,640 --> 02:56:48,500
that was us getting our 10,000
hours.

3829
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:53,950
Yeah,
and it's really like for the most part 

3830
02:56:53,950 --> 02:56:53,950
it's like 10 years,
right?

3831
02:56:53,950 --> 02:56:57,970
Like 10 years for you know,
what you're doing really didn't even 

3832
02:56:57,970 --> 02:56:58,400
then you're pretty shaky.
Think Seinfeld said 14.

3833
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:01,400
He might be right.
It's hard to call,

3834
02:57:02,150 --> 02:57:04,580
but it's a,
it's just so interesting.

3835
02:57:04,581 --> 02:57:05,690
When you look back you're like,
wow.

3836
02:57:05,691 --> 02:57:07,550
It all sort of played itself out.
Like it.

3837
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,300
Like it was a program.
It's like if you were a folk musician in

3838
02:57:11,301 --> 02:57:15,890
the village in 1963,
so it smells way better.

3839
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:20,920
Yeah.
And those guys never made any fucking 

3840
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:20,920
money.
Yeah.

3841
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:21,050
Folk musicians.
There was a few that broke free,

3842
02:57:21,170 --> 02:57:22,020
right?
Like who was,

3843
02:57:22,030 --> 02:57:24,230
who was like a big folk musicians.
Joni Mitchell,

3844
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:25,840
right.
Trying to.

3845
02:57:25,870 --> 02:57:30,870
Mitchell is a bad ass bitch.
She was about aspects that album blue I 

3846
02:57:30,870 --> 02:57:32,690
would put up against any album in 
history.

3847
02:57:32,990 --> 02:57:36,980
She had some really creative vocals to 
really creative lyrics.

3848
02:57:37,250 --> 02:57:40,180
What a voice range.
Yeah.

3849
02:57:40,190 --> 02:57:41,720
She's someone that you don't really 
hear,

3850
02:57:41,990 --> 02:57:46,990
you know,
like you could be at any given bar at 

3851
02:57:46,990 --> 02:57:47,450
any given night and here,
sweet home,

3852
02:57:47,451 --> 02:57:52,451
Alabama,
but what are the odds that you're gonna 

3853
02:57:52,451 --> 02:57:52,451
hear?
Like chuckie's and love,

3854
02:57:52,451 --> 02:57:52,451
right?
You know,

3855
02:57:53,390 --> 02:57:54,990
California.
Yeah.

3856
02:57:55,050 --> 02:57:57,980
That's some great songs.
Moody songs.

3857
02:57:58,070 --> 02:58:01,010
Yeah.
Like they command your attention.

3858
02:58:01,110 --> 02:58:02,250
Can't passively listen

3859
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:04,680
to Joni Mitchell.
Yeah.

3860
02:58:04,681 --> 02:58:07,410
There's a bunch of pave paradise.
Put a parking lot,

3861
02:58:07,450 --> 02:58:09,690
Greg.
That's a great song.

3862
02:58:10,570 --> 02:58:11,200
Yeah.

3863
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:13,230
Yeah.
It's interesting,

3864
02:58:13,231 --> 02:58:14,140
man.
The,

3865
02:58:14,250 --> 02:58:19,250
the,
the what we've just seen pass in our 

3866
02:58:19,250 --> 02:58:22,461
lifetimes.
The different styles of music and the 

3867
02:58:22,461 --> 02:58:22,890
different,
like errors of music,

3868
02:58:22,891 --> 02:58:25,140
of the eighties error.
Like when we were in high school,

3869
02:58:25,141 --> 02:58:27,020
it was all like van Halen.
Yeah.

3870
02:58:27,090 --> 02:58:30,300
You know,
it was all like was always in and out.

3871
02:58:30,320 --> 02:58:32,800
Good.
But it was hairbands,

3872
02:58:33,450 --> 02:58:36,160
you know,
def Leopard,

3873
02:58:37,110 --> 02:58:37,890
foreigner,

3874
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:41,040
foreigner feels like the

3875
02:58:44,680 --> 02:58:49,680
name.
Every band member I was selling to 

3876
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:49,680
foreigner.
Yeah.

3877
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:51,150
Company and

3878
02:58:52,040 --> 02:58:57,040
Btl bad company had that song.
A shooting star,

3879
02:58:58,231 --> 02:59:00,270
right.
That was the song that every kid thought

3880
02:59:00,271 --> 02:59:00,640
was about right?

3881
02:59:00,700 --> 02:59:01,280
Nah,
Nah,

3882
02:59:01,290 --> 02:59:02,360
Nah,
Nah.

3883
02:59:03,430 --> 02:59:06,670
John was a school boy when he heard his 
first Beatles' song.

3884
02:59:07,510 --> 02:59:08,230
Right?
Yeah,

3885
02:59:08,990 --> 02:59:10,900
me too.
I think it was from there,

3886
02:59:10,901 --> 02:59:15,901
it didn't take him long and then it's 
this whole thing about him becoming this

3887
02:59:16,061 --> 02:59:17,230
rock and roll star

3888
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:22,530
and then dying like real young died in 
his bed.

3889
02:59:23,110 --> 02:59:25,090
There's like four songs that are like 
that.

3890
02:59:25,091 --> 02:59:26,260
They were about like,
uh,

3891
02:59:26,970 --> 02:59:29,020
you know,
here's a story of chuck and Diane.

3892
02:59:29,290 --> 02:59:34,290
It's always about like the midwestern 
kids that go out to la and then they 

3893
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:34,890
break up and she becomes a whore and

3894
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:42,700
yeah.
Yeah.

3895
02:59:44,620 --> 02:59:46,330
John Cougar,
mellencamp man.

3896
02:59:46,950 --> 02:59:47,580
Um,
you know,

3897
02:59:47,590 --> 02:59:49,090
he had a lot of those kinds of songs,
right?

3898
02:59:49,091 --> 02:59:51,580
Yeah.
I was in Indiana once,

3899
02:59:51,610 --> 02:59:52,630
which is where he's from,
right?

3900
02:59:52,631 --> 02:59:55,480
You would think God Damn Indiana for 
John Cougar Mellencamp.

3901
02:59:55,481 --> 03:00:00,481
It's like if Bruce,
bruce springsteen is anywhere in New 

3902
03:00:00,481 --> 03:00:00,481
Jersey,
like at a sporting event,

3903
03:00:00,481 --> 03:00:01,840
and you put a camera on Bruce 
Springsteen,

3904
03:00:02,230 --> 03:00:04,000
people are going to go for the fucking 
boss,

3905
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:05,850
the boss

3906
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:07,670
anywhere.
He goes,

3907
03:00:07,671 --> 03:00:09,260
right?
Not John Cougar.

3908
03:00:09,261 --> 03:00:11,330
Mellencamp man.
They didn't like them.

3909
03:00:11,360 --> 03:00:13,190
No Shit.
Nice liberal.

3910
03:00:13,690 --> 03:00:15,390
Oh

3911
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:17,720
yeah.
Motherfucker had asked.

3912
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:19,560
The guy worked there I go,
hey man,

3913
03:00:19,561 --> 03:00:22,590
why are they booing?
John Cougar Mellencamp and he also,

3914
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:27,060
he's generally thought of as a liberal 
in like a fake Indiana person.

3915
03:00:27,430 --> 03:00:28,560
Yeah,
like you sold out.

3916
03:00:28,830 --> 03:00:29,580
Damn.
Yeah.

3917
03:00:29,620 --> 03:00:33,690
Indiana's conservative.
We're conservative for the KKK was born.

3918
03:00:34,410 --> 03:00:39,410
He's Jack and Diane like you're not.
You're not gonna gonna Cheer for a guy 

3919
03:00:39,410 --> 03:00:41,460
from your town level.
Janice's.

3920
03:00:41,670 --> 03:00:43,050
Oh my God.
Yeah,

3921
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:45,430
but Jack and Diane come on son.
Yeah,

3922
03:00:46,780 --> 03:00:50,530
there is times a motherfucker time when.

3923
03:00:50,650 --> 03:00:51,760
Yeah,
I mean here's.

3924
03:00:51,761 --> 03:00:56,761
He's one of those guys that like when he
was around when we were around in the 

3925
03:00:56,761 --> 03:00:56,761
eighties and I was like,
you know,

3926
03:00:56,761 --> 03:00:58,990
they were pop songs.
I didn't really register.

3927
03:00:59,010 --> 03:01:01,570
I'd kind of.
He was a little bit laughable to me.

3928
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:04,060
And then you get older and you just have
to respect,

3929
03:01:05,170 --> 03:01:10,170
you know,
it's almost like somebody brought this 

3930
03:01:10,170 --> 03:01:10,170
up the other day,
hall and Oates,

3931
03:01:10,170 --> 03:01:11,620
we're fucking laughing stock and now I 
listen to some of these songs is like,

3932
03:01:12,030 --> 03:01:14,710
it's a fucking good song.
You know what a lot of it is,

3933
03:01:15,220 --> 03:01:20,220
there's something like,
go back to that picture you just showed 

3934
03:01:20,220 --> 03:01:23,160
this.
Something about a guy who can even pull 

3935
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:23,160
this off that I cannot root for.
Yeah.

3936
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:26,200
Yeah.
He's sitting in a convertible car.

3937
03:01:26,650 --> 03:01:29,430
He has beautiful hair.
He is a.

3938
03:01:29,470 --> 03:01:31,990
his arms are up.
You as a sleeveless shirt on.

3939
03:01:31,991 --> 03:01:35,050
He has some sort of a bracelet on and 
he's hanging back with his feet up.

3940
03:01:35,051 --> 03:01:40,051
He's super confident and casual and he's
a beautiful man and he's singing about 

3941
03:01:40,051 --> 03:01:43,891
love and all these different things and 
this part of you at that age would just 

3942
03:01:43,891 --> 03:01:44,560
look at it.
You like this is ridiculous.

3943
03:01:44,870 --> 03:01:46,960
Yeah.
The cowboy boots selling this picture of

3944
03:01:46,961 --> 03:01:49,540
the tubes he had Nike's on.
It wouldn't be the same kind of photo.

3945
03:01:49,990 --> 03:01:51,730
Cowboy boots are important to be down 
home.

3946
03:01:51,731 --> 03:01:56,731
He's got an old ass car too.
You think John Cougar Mellencamp can't 

3947
03:01:56,731 --> 03:01:56,740
afford a new car.
Why is he got that fucking old car?

3948
03:01:56,980 --> 03:01:59,300
Because the old cars like down home.
Yeah.

3949
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:01,120
Yeah.
He's got a car that like it.

3950
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:02,800
It makes noise.
When you started out,

3951
03:02:02,820 --> 03:02:07,820
man,
it's like some old mg or some shit like 

3952
03:02:07,820 --> 03:02:08,770
that.
Like you wouldn't really drive that.

3953
03:02:08,980 --> 03:02:11,050
He's probably get this stinky piece of 
shit away from me.

3954
03:02:11,051 --> 03:02:12,970
It's fucking shitty car with bad breaks.

3955
03:02:13,190 --> 03:02:14,180
Yeah.
Where's my fucking.

3956
03:02:14,360 --> 03:02:16,760
Where's my,
where's my Maserati?

3957
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:17,630
He,
uh,

3958
03:02:17,930 --> 03:02:21,320
at one point he changed his name from 
John Cougar.

3959
03:02:21,321 --> 03:02:24,650
Mellencamp know from John Cougar to John
Cougar.

3960
03:02:24,651 --> 03:02:29,651
Mellencamp.
I think it had something to do with his 

3961
03:02:29,651 --> 03:02:29,651
label.
Was trying to market him as John Cougar.

3962
03:02:29,651 --> 03:02:29,920
Well,
his real name is

3963
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:34,960
John Mellencamp.
And when they were making his first 

3964
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:38,441
album come out,
changed name mellencamp song going to 

3965
03:02:38,441 --> 03:02:38,441
sell.
We're gonna.

3966
03:02:38,441 --> 03:02:38,441
Call you John Cougar.
Cougar.

3967
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:40,820
It sounds American.
It sounds like rugged.

3968
03:02:40,821 --> 03:02:43,250
Do you mean you got boots on brother 
Cougar?

3969
03:02:43,340 --> 03:02:44,850
You are a cougar.
So they.

3970
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:48,050
So they,
they sell it as John Cougar.

3971
03:02:48,051 --> 03:02:49,070
And then he's like,
hey man,

3972
03:02:49,071 --> 03:02:50,720
I want to be John Mellencamp.
Like,

3973
03:02:50,721 --> 03:02:51,650
no,
you can't do it.

3974
03:02:51,770 --> 03:02:53,030
How about John Cougar?
Mellencamp.

3975
03:02:53,031 --> 03:02:55,760
Okay.
The worst name of all time.

3976
03:02:55,761 --> 03:02:58,880
Cougar Mellencamp like did he get 
married?

3977
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:01,280
Married himself,
married a dude,

3978
03:03:01,730 --> 03:03:04,130
and now he's a mellencamp.
And these hyphenated it.

3979
03:03:04,730 --> 03:03:07,710
Wait,
is it melon camp or is it melancholy?

3980
03:03:07,740 --> 03:03:08,990
Remember Mike Sullivan.
Irwin,

3981
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:14,060
of course,
he was the first guy I ever met that 

3982
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:14,060
took his wife's name.
He did.

3983
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:15,590
His name is Mike Sullivan.
Her name is Irvin.

3984
03:03:16,050 --> 03:03:18,890
You became Mike Sullivan.
Irvin Jesus.

3985
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:21,170
Whoops.
First Guy I ever met.

3986
03:03:21,171 --> 03:03:23,540
They call themselves a feminist too.
Interesting.

3987
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:26,090
He had women don't even call themselves 
feminists anymore.

3988
03:03:26,091 --> 03:03:28,920
I was asking because I've been asking 
the women in the what

3989
03:03:29,960 --> 03:03:31,060
I was online.

3990
03:03:32,720 --> 03:03:34,640
It's like,
how do you.

3991
03:03:34,670 --> 03:03:36,260
How were you not a feminist if you're a 
woman?

3992
03:03:36,290 --> 03:03:39,650
Isn't that just saying I want to have 
equal pay for equal work?

3993
03:03:41,250 --> 03:03:46,250
First of all,
you most certainly are thinking very 

3994
03:03:46,250 --> 03:03:46,650
strongly in often about women's issues.
Right?

3995
03:03:46,710 --> 03:03:51,710
Right.
Which I guess you have to if you're a 

3996
03:03:51,710 --> 03:03:52,020
woman,
but I'm realistically.

3997
03:03:52,590 --> 03:03:56,520
You should probably be thinking of like 
the humanity as a whole.

3998
03:03:56,550 --> 03:04:01,550
Right?
Shouldn't be really focused on one 

3999
03:04:01,550 --> 03:04:01,550
gender

4000
03:04:01,550 --> 03:04:01,550
because this is just.
Just hear me out for a second.

4001
03:04:01,550 --> 03:04:05,471
If you're getting mad,
if we're all like completely 

4002
03:04:05,471 --> 03:04:07,490
concentrating on one specific gender,
like female,

4003
03:04:07,530 --> 03:04:10,370
you can.
The concerns only of the female,

4004
03:04:10,810 --> 03:04:13,970
you're automatically like breaking 
yourself off into a team.

4005
03:04:14,090 --> 03:04:16,400
This is like those guys.
They're like men's rights guys,

4006
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:18,870
like that's all they talk about,
saw the tweet about,

4007
03:04:18,890 --> 03:04:20,720
so they want to talk about is men's 
rights.

4008
03:04:20,721 --> 03:04:23,150
Men's men are getting fucked over in 
this country and amendment.

4009
03:04:23,490 --> 03:04:27,920
They're forming natural teams.
It's like a windows user was getting mad

4010
03:04:27,921 --> 03:04:32,921
at pc or it was getting mad at Max.
It's a weird thing that people start 

4011
03:04:32,921 --> 03:04:36,230
doing when you lock people into any sort
of a one or the other,

4012
03:04:36,290 --> 03:04:38,450
like right wing versus left wing,
you know,

4013
03:04:38,460 --> 03:04:39,000
like,
uh,

4014
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:41,450
people who are straight edge versus 
people like to party.

4015
03:04:41,570 --> 03:04:46,570
There's,
you get these locked in ideologies and 

4016
03:04:46,570 --> 03:04:46,570
that's a big one.

4017
03:04:46,570 --> 03:04:46,570
Man.
That's a big one.

4018
03:04:46,570 --> 03:04:51,251
The gender ones a big one because pc's 
are not making less money than Max.

4019
03:04:52,640 --> 03:04:57,640
See,
that's the thing about that whole 

4020
03:04:57,640 --> 03:04:57,640
narrative about women making less money 
than men.

4021
03:04:57,640 --> 03:04:58,970
I don't know if you've ever investigated
it,

4022
03:04:58,971 --> 03:05:03,971
but I had a long conversation with a 
good friend of mine about it recently 

4023
03:05:03,971 --> 03:05:04,790
where he was saying it wrong too.
This is the reality.

4024
03:05:04,970 --> 03:05:07,490
The reality is when they do these 
gender,

4025
03:05:08,540 --> 03:05:13,480
gender income disparity studies,
the.

4026
03:05:13,490 --> 03:05:18,490
It's not like they're giving you the 
impression that a man and a woman to 

4027
03:05:18,490 --> 03:05:21,581
work next to each other and they doing 
the same job at the woman's making 

4028
03:05:21,581 --> 03:05:22,610
seventy seven cents to the man's dollar.
That's not what the study showed.

4029
03:05:22,850 --> 03:05:27,850
What the study showed is that overall 
the men earned more money than the women

4030
03:05:28,221 --> 03:05:33,221
did if they were both working and it 
didn't mean that they were doing the 

4031
03:05:33,221 --> 03:05:33,221
same job.

4032
03:05:33,221 --> 03:05:33,530
In fact,
it means the opposite.

4033
03:05:33,531 --> 03:05:35,660
Men were choosing jobs that are much 
more high risk.

4034
03:05:36,020 --> 03:05:41,020
They were working longer hours,
so you're comparing women who worked on 

4035
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:43,760
an average of 35 hours to men who worked
40 hours plus and doing different jobs,

4036
03:05:43,880 --> 03:05:44,870
so it wasn't.
But,

4037
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:49,900
but this is the study.
The study's not that to people like 

4038
03:05:49,900 --> 03:05:52,901
your.
I'm an accountant and she's an 

4039
03:05:52,901 --> 03:05:52,901
accountant and you both do the exact 
same job,

4040
03:05:52,901 --> 03:05:57,110
the exact same workload,
and you make $100 where she makes $77.

4041
03:05:57,140 --> 03:05:59,270
That's.
But that's how everybody wants study.

4042
03:05:59,271 --> 03:06:04,271
There's other studies that show like 
categorically Walmart was paying the 

4043
03:06:04,271 --> 03:06:05,240
same job.
They were paying women less.

4044
03:06:05,270 --> 03:06:10,270
That's entirely possible and given 
individual companies that could be 

4045
03:06:10,270 --> 03:06:13,220
sexist for sure 100 percent,
but that's not like what gets spit out.

4046
03:06:13,610 --> 03:06:18,610
Everybody spits out that women make 
seventy seven cents to every man's 

4047
03:06:18,610 --> 03:06:18,610
dollar.
It's just not true.

4048
03:06:18,610 --> 03:06:20,630
It's not like they're doing the same 
jobs.

4049
03:06:20,660 --> 03:06:23,300
I mean you could argue that there was 
one of the.

4050
03:06:23,301 --> 03:06:28,301
One of the best arguments about it was 
that they were saying that women being 

4051
03:06:28,301 --> 03:06:32,561
less confident or less likely to be 
assertive early on and negotiate a good 

4052
03:06:32,991 --> 03:06:35,360
salary for themselves and that could be 
an issue,

4053
03:06:35,540 --> 03:06:40,540
but over time that sort of balanced 
itself out with performance and that 

4054
03:06:40,540 --> 03:06:44,211
there was a.
This was the hypothesis that was thrown 

4055
03:06:44,211 --> 03:06:45,230
around by one one,
a one article,

4056
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:48,350
but the overall numbers are not what 
everybody says.

4057
03:06:48,590 --> 03:06:51,500
Everybody loves to say those numbers.
They love to heart those numbers back at

4058
03:06:51,501 --> 03:06:52,490
you.
That would say,

4059
03:06:52,491 --> 03:06:57,491
you know,
women make seventy seven cents to every 

4060
03:06:57,491 --> 03:06:57,491
man's dollar.
It's a sexist world,

4061
03:06:57,491 --> 03:06:57,780
but it's not.
It's not what's going on.

4062
03:06:57,810 --> 03:07:02,610
It might be still a section on maternity
leave and there's things that are just,

4063
03:07:02,670 --> 03:07:07,670
you know,
going to hold a woman back from making 

4064
03:07:07,670 --> 03:07:09,891
more money because yes,
she should lose her place in line 

4065
03:07:09,891 --> 03:07:11,010
basically by taking materially I get 
that,

4066
03:07:11,430 --> 03:07:16,430
but there has been plenty of studies of 
ceos that are making the disparity in 

4067
03:07:17,071 --> 03:07:21,030
what ceos of major companies when they 
look at the same size,

4068
03:07:21,031 --> 03:07:26,031
companies making the same profits every 
year and then you've got the woman 

4069
03:07:26,031 --> 03:07:26,031
making,
you know,

4070
03:07:26,031 --> 03:07:27,490
consistently seventy cents on the 
dollar.

4071
03:07:27,490 --> 03:07:29,700
He's generous for some of those jobs.
I know about that study.

4072
03:07:29,701 --> 03:07:31,440
I don't know if that's true,
but again,

4073
03:07:31,800 --> 03:07:36,800
you're talking about ceos and this is a 
very rare segment of the population I 

4074
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:37,720
don't think needs any sympathy.
Right?

4075
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:42,800
Like any woman who is the CEO is 
probably making some fucking ridiculous 

4076
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:46,011
amount of money in the first place and 
it's always overexaggerated how much 

4077
03:07:46,011 --> 03:07:49,251
money they make but wouldn't accompany.
Be Ridiculous if they paid a woman less 

4078
03:07:50,371 --> 03:07:54,660
money and she's making them more money.
Like wouldn't she leave and go somewhere

4079
03:07:54,661 --> 03:07:57,060
where she would make more money?
Like if she's that good,

4080
03:07:57,061 --> 03:07:59,730
if she's competing with men and going 
right up against them,

4081
03:07:59,880 --> 03:08:00,960
this is the argument,
right?

4082
03:08:01,760 --> 03:08:03,780
Um,
I don't have the answer because I'm,

4083
03:08:03,781 --> 03:08:08,781
I'm,
I'm obviously just reading these 

4084
03:08:08,781 --> 03:08:08,781
statistics and reading one of these 
people said,

4085
03:08:08,781 --> 03:08:10,800
but I would,
I would imagine there's some deep seated

4086
03:08:10,801 --> 03:08:15,300
sexism that is almost impossible to 
overcome mental want women as bosses for

4087
03:08:15,301 --> 03:08:17,190
the most part,
like subconscious.

4088
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:22,880
But whether or not that's responsible 
for women making less money in the same 

4089
03:08:23,071 --> 03:08:25,770
jobs,
apparently not according to the numbers,

4090
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:29,340
according to the numbers.
A lot of it is the choosing of different

4091
03:08:29,341 --> 03:08:34,341
paths in life as far as careers that 
like that's why this push to get women 

4092
03:08:34,341 --> 03:08:38,211
into stem.
That's why this push to get women into 

4093
03:08:38,211 --> 03:08:38,211
technology like tech,
like silicone valley,

4094
03:08:38,211 --> 03:08:39,780
there's this big disparity between men 
and women.

4095
03:08:40,170 --> 03:08:45,170
But that display was parodies.
Like real similar to how it is in a lot 

4096
03:08:45,170 --> 03:08:48,261
of tech.
It's like most women don't gravitate 

4097
03:08:48,261 --> 03:08:48,690
towards those jobs,
but if they do,

4098
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:53,900
they find them.
There's not that many women as opposed 

4099
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:53,900
to men.
It's much,

4100
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:55,020
much.
I think tech like look this up.

4101
03:08:55,021 --> 03:08:57,750
Like what is Silicone Valley?
What are the just crazy.

4102
03:08:57,751 --> 03:08:58,880
It's a real problem.
It's like,

4103
03:08:59,070 --> 03:09:01,080
is it a problem though?
But this is the question,

4104
03:09:01,081 --> 03:09:04,470
like that's something that people always
pair it and repeat that it's a problem.

4105
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:09,800
I don't know if it's a problem or if 
it's held women naturally navigate 

4106
03:09:10,021 --> 03:09:12,070
towards different careers than men do.
I think,

4107
03:09:12,120 --> 03:09:14,220
well look,
none of this stuff is black and white.

4108
03:09:14,221 --> 03:09:19,221
I think that's part of it.
I think part of it is also when women 

4109
03:09:19,221 --> 03:09:19,221
have role models,
they think,

4110
03:09:19,221 --> 03:09:20,340
oh,
well I want to be like,

4111
03:09:20,730 --> 03:09:25,730
you know,
I think now that you've got some big 

4112
03:09:25,730 --> 03:09:25,730
corporate ceos,
uh,

4113
03:09:25,730 --> 03:09:26,780
the woman that wrote that book,
Lean in and uh,

4114
03:09:27,740 --> 03:09:28,860
uh,
whatever,

4115
03:09:28,870 --> 03:09:30,250
um,
I think it,

4116
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:32,370
it,
it allows women to visualize,

4117
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:37,400
you know,
and that's why I think it's important 

4118
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:37,400
that Hillary Clinton,
when she was president,

4119
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:38,730
as much as I'm not a fan of hers,
I think it will accomplish setting a new

4120
03:09:38,970 --> 03:09:40,770
goal for women.
We'll do this one though,

4121
03:09:41,010 --> 03:09:44,490
and silicone valley men,
69 percent more likely to receive higher

4122
03:09:44,491 --> 03:09:47,250
salary offer.
So for their initial first salary,

4123
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:51,300
69 percent more likely,
I wonder,

4124
03:09:51,330 --> 03:09:56,330
you know,
I guess there's gotTa be discrimination 

4125
03:09:56,330 --> 03:09:59,041
when you think about a woman that wants 
to get pregnant and have a family and 

4126
03:09:59,041 --> 03:10:01,591
she's going to take time off work and if
you're going to have to give her 

4127
03:10:01,591 --> 03:10:03,661
maternity leave,
that's gonna be unproductive money that 

4128
03:10:03,661 --> 03:10:03,661
your company has to give out.

4129
03:10:03,661 --> 03:10:04,170
It's interesting,
man.

4130
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:06,810
That lady sued.
She sued.

4131
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:08,490
That is a.
I forget her name.

4132
03:10:09,240 --> 03:10:12,060
Yeah.
She sued Margaret Cho notions.

4133
03:10:12,061 --> 03:10:12,720
Who?
Margaret Cho.

4134
03:10:13,470 --> 03:10:16,650
She sued some company.
It was a google Microsoft.

4135
03:10:16,740 --> 03:10:18,630
Who the fuck she.
So she sued someone.

4136
03:10:18,631 --> 03:10:22,380
I think it was Google for a gender 
discrimination and lost.

4137
03:10:23,160 --> 03:10:25,020
It wasn't the reddit.
Yeah,

4138
03:10:25,021 --> 03:10:27,360
she was read it after that.
She went to reddit after that.

4139
03:10:27,361 --> 03:10:30,300
And people were upset that she went over
there after she was.

4140
03:10:30,360 --> 03:10:33,930
They thought running would appear to be 
a frivolous lawsuit.

4141
03:10:33,980 --> 03:10:36,180
Uh Hm.
I don't know.

4142
03:10:36,181 --> 03:10:38,100
It was frivolous,
but it lost.

4143
03:10:38,610 --> 03:10:39,330
Yeah.
Look,

4144
03:10:39,331 --> 03:10:41,430
I wouldn't want to be a chick.
Work with a bunch of dudes.

4145
03:10:41,610 --> 03:10:43,890
I'll tell you that right now.
Whether it's sexist or not,

4146
03:10:44,310 --> 03:10:49,310
I would not want to be a woman in an 
office with nine other dudes that are 

4147
03:10:49,310 --> 03:10:53,510
like scrapping and scraping to try to 
climb the corporate ladder and I got to 

4148
03:10:53,510 --> 03:10:58,131
compete with these ass Fox and they're 
all out playing golf and talking shit 

4149
03:10:58,131 --> 03:11:01,581
about my ass.
He showed up at work every day with 

4150
03:11:01,581 --> 03:11:02,580
these cuts.
Yeah.

4151
03:11:02,790 --> 03:11:03,360
It's hard,

4152
03:11:03,750 --> 03:11:07,170
but it's good for the guys.
I hate workplaces that are all guys I've

4153
03:11:07,171 --> 03:11:08,070
written on shows.
Everyone.

4154
03:11:08,071 --> 03:11:13,071
I'm bill Maher show for awhile and it 
was all dudes talking like dudes and 

4155
03:11:13,071 --> 03:11:17,211
they start outdoing each other.
You throw one woman in the room and all 

4156
03:11:17,211 --> 03:11:20,721
of a sudden everybody just fucking 
mellows out a little bit and I think 

4157
03:11:20,721 --> 03:11:21,890
it's more productive.
What can you equal opportunity maps?

4158
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:27,640
Equal opportunity?
Oh

4159
03:11:30,210 --> 03:11:32,130
yeah.
Look,

4160
03:11:32,280 --> 03:11:34,770
it's impossible to generalize in big,
broad,

4161
03:11:34,771 --> 03:11:36,720
sweeping,
judge brushes,

4162
03:11:36,780 --> 03:11:38,570
you know,
difference between men and women.

4163
03:11:38,610 --> 03:11:42,990
Just there's so much variety and there's
so many people that are women that would

4164
03:11:42,991 --> 03:11:47,991
thrive in a high pressure,
high stress situations alongside men and

4165
03:11:48,331 --> 03:11:50,670
so many women that just won't.
It just,

4166
03:11:50,730 --> 03:11:52,170
they just,
that's not their thing.

4167
03:11:52,171 --> 03:11:54,750
They don't want to do it if you put them
in there that hate their fucking life,

4168
03:11:55,240 --> 03:12:00,240
like how many people who if they had to 
do what you do would be in hell every 

4169
03:12:00,240 --> 03:12:01,020
day,
shitting their pants,

4170
03:12:01,021 --> 03:12:02,280
sweating,
nervous,

4171
03:12:02,281 --> 03:12:04,560
can't come up with a joke,
don't think anything they have to say is

4172
03:12:04,561 --> 03:12:09,561
interesting.
Can't string the words together 

4173
03:12:09,561 --> 03:12:09,561
correctly.
They get on a podcast like this.

4174
03:12:09,561 --> 03:12:13,240
We don't fucking plan a goddamn thing 
and we've already been going for three 

4175
03:12:13,240 --> 03:12:13,740
hours and 20 minutes.
Shut the fuck out of the time.

4176
03:12:13,741 --> 03:12:17,070
It's almost five.
Holy Shit.

4177
03:12:17,280 --> 03:12:20,820
It just flies,
flies by.

4178
03:12:20,940 --> 03:12:25,940
They'd be shitting their pants,
but you'd be shitting your pants if you 

4179
03:12:25,940 --> 03:12:28,161
had to be.
A fucking accountant will go over 

4180
03:12:28,161 --> 03:12:28,161
people's taxes

4181
03:12:28,161 --> 03:12:28,490
having to work.
Here's the thing about those guys.

4182
03:12:28,820 --> 03:12:31,730
They gotta show up to work everyday and 
work all day,

4183
03:12:31,731 --> 03:12:33,430
almost nonstop.
Finished.

4184
03:12:33,431 --> 03:12:35,750
Go home,
do it again the next day,

4185
03:12:35,810 --> 03:12:37,790
every day.
Work on the weekends.

4186
03:12:37,820 --> 03:12:38,990
That's what freaks me out.

4187
03:12:39,270 --> 03:12:41,370
You've got to get this account done.
I hate to do this to you,

4188
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:46,400
but I need you on the phone.
Twenty four slash seven all this 

4189
03:12:46,400 --> 03:12:46,400
weekend,
but my kid,

4190
03:12:46,400 --> 03:12:47,300
my birthday,
you listen,

4191
03:12:47,390 --> 03:12:48,810
happening.
That's competent aid yet.

4192
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:50,820
Phone under the pillow.
Asil B.

4193
03:12:50,970 --> 03:12:52,160
Well,
what'd you do

4194
03:12:52,250 --> 03:12:54,370
today to work out?
Yes I did.

4195
03:12:54,430 --> 03:12:59,430
I shot bows and arrows.
Did you went out there to do a little 

4196
03:12:59,430 --> 03:13:02,390
archery point is proven.
You shot bows and arrows.

4197
03:13:02,870 --> 03:13:06,320
How many accountants got to fucking take
a little bow and shoot it at target?

4198
03:13:06,321 --> 03:13:08,390
It's therapy.
It's good.

4199
03:13:08,391 --> 03:13:09,350
It's good.
Speaking of which,

4200
03:13:09,380 --> 03:13:10,410
let's play.
That's it.

4201
03:13:10,420 --> 03:13:11,820
That's my bow.
Wow.

4202
03:13:11,900 --> 03:13:15,910
Play some motherfucking pool.
So let's end this podcast.

4203
03:13:15,950 --> 03:13:19,070
Greg Fitzsimmons brought his pool.
Que Yo.

4204
03:13:19,130 --> 03:13:20,390
Hey,
I'm going to ask you something.

4205
03:13:20,510 --> 03:13:25,510
Please do.
Should I ask you on air off the air if 

4206
03:13:25,510 --> 03:13:25,510
you can do a benefit?
Oh,

4207
03:13:25,510 --> 03:13:26,000
you should definitely do it on the air 
and put me on the spot.

4208
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:31,840
Put you on the spot for October 16th.
We're doing a benefit for best buddies,

4209
03:13:31,941 --> 03:13:34,550
which is a group I worked with for 
special needs people.

4210
03:13:35,930 --> 03:13:38,600
Intellectually disadvantaged people.
We call it now.

4211
03:13:38,900 --> 03:13:42,050
The 16th is a Sunday at the law,
at the comedy store.

4212
03:13:42,051 --> 03:13:44,090
Main Room.
Are you kidding me?

4213
03:13:44,150 --> 03:13:49,150
I'm a fucking grown man.
Tickets are on sale by the time you 

4214
03:13:49,150 --> 03:13:49,430
listen to this God damn podcast

4215
03:13:49,560 --> 03:13:52,800
simmons benefit.
Can you get some?

4216
03:13:53,210 --> 03:13:55,760
I'm a grown up now.
I'm doing this now from.

4217
03:13:55,830 --> 03:13:56,640
From now on,
folks.

4218
03:13:56,641 --> 03:13:58,950
I'm actually putting things in my 
calendar immediately.

4219
03:13:58,980 --> 03:14:01,610
Nice to remind you.
I kept going out.

4220
03:14:01,660 --> 03:14:04,870
Fucking get to it.
I'll get to it and then I don't cry.

4221
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:09,320
She's doing it too.
That's it.

4222
03:14:09,530 --> 03:14:12,440
You fuckers.
This podcast is over.

4223
03:14:12,441 --> 03:14:16,160
Greg Fitzsimmons is awesome.
Go see him live.

4224
03:14:16,210 --> 03:14:21,210
Go see him live.
We'll probably be back Saturday with a 

4225
03:14:21,210 --> 03:14:23,870
fight companion for a daytime fight this
Saturday.

4226
03:14:24,130 --> 03:14:26,120
It's at noon.
I think it's at noon.

4227
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:28,010
La Time.
So Saturday.

4228
03:14:28,011 --> 03:14:30,080
We'll see you fuckers.
All right.

4229
03:14:30,081 --> 03:14:32,490
Thank you everybody.
Appreciate you by the cast.
