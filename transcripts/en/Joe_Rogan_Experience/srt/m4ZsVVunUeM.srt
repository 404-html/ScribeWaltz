1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,520
Yay.
Yes,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,930
that's it.
We live.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,190
We live.
That's live.

4
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,170
What's up baby?
How you doing?

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,610
You doing good to see a brother that is 
a very colorful,

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,900
you've got a lot going on with that 
shirt.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,450
What's happening?
Fish it fishermen's outfit.

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,280
Is that what it is?
It's a,

9
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,130
it's an old nautica shirt I found.
Oh,

10
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:17,964
it's like,
it's a shirt that has pictures of rain 

11
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,611
gear hanging up on hooks and binoculars 
and boots and nets and shit.

12
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:27,420
Very,
it's a very powerful shirt.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,130
Nautical theme shirt.
Yeah.

14
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:29,964
It's like a,
like a nautical shed where you put your 

15
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,820
nautical gear.
Ice Fishing I think.

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,980
Do you fish?
I did in Orlando.

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,210
Used to fish a lot.
Yeah.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah.
I was like,

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,820
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't party for a couple of years.

20
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:45,420
I get tested so I just went fishing 
after school instead of partying instead

21
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:45,860
of partying.

22
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,300
Well you getting tested for just,
you know,

23
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,270
like your probation officer was show up 
at your crib or whatever.

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,270
What'd you do to get you a probation 
officer?

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,040
I had a,
I had like a,

26
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,410
I think we talked about this before.
I had like an assault,

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,830
like my second year of college,
I caught an assault charge,

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,370
but it was self defense and assault,
self defense,

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,050
self defense.
So I plan out,

30
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,370
but um,
no,

31
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,370
me and my buddy justin forming like a 
quote and go party.

32
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,000
But he would come pick me up and we just
go fishing on the lakes and shit.

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,040
So Orlando's got really good bass 
fishing.

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,660
No,
it really does.

35
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,240
I love fish.
I'm weighing a bass fishing.

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,160
I'll building like large mouth.
Yeah,

37
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,200
large mouth.
I do the rubber worms,

38
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,580
like the frogs off the lily pads.
Spinnerbaits all that jazz crank baits,

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,540
little Rapala,
little minnows and shit.

40
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,090
Mine was the watermelon seed worms that 
bounce off the,

41
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,050
off the,
that was what you do.

42
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,770
Did you ever get like one of those 
boats,

43
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,604
those little bass boats with a flat 
bottoms and you can move around with a 

44
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,370
little trolling motor.
So what we did was I had a canoe,

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,110
I had a canoeist decrypt,
but then on the other leg we saw this,

46
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,944
uh,
onboard voter that the dude had just 

47
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,070
left on his dock.
So one night we were,

48
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,920
we were younger.
It was like high school where I was,

49
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:59,910
so we stole this dude's and boat and put
it on my canoe.

50
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,530
So we were cruising with the fucking,
the,

51
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,230
the onboard motor on my canoe.
How did you install it on a canoe?

52
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,050
Because it couldn't do as a pointy end 
as opposed to a flat end.

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,401
I Dunno.
My boy,

54
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,360
justin figured it out.

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,330
I have no idea how he fucking did it,
but it doesn't make any sense.

56
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,970
He rigged it up to put it on the back of
the shit,

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,953
but cause it couldn't,
it has two points as a point in the 

58
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,580
front and appoint in the back.
Yeah.

59
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,543
How,
how the hell do you get a motor back 

60
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,990
there?
He did it.

61
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,850
I have no idea.
He called it the,

62
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,290
was it a,
um,

63
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,173
a trolling motor,
like a real quiet one or was it a big 

64
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,450
heavy,
like it was the quiet little one.

65
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,780
You can put it on the front,
right?

66
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,420
That little little thing.
Yeah,

67
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,080
yeah,
yeah,

68
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,621
yeah,
yeah.

69
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,860
The idea of those is you want to like 
almost kind of go against uh,

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,540
the,
uh,

71
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,770
like of a titus pulling you one way or 
the the,

72
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,690
you know,
or move along the bank.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,970
You know,
you're in freshwater use them.

74
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,043
Actually they're probably only using 
fresh water cause you could creep into 

75
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,344
the lily pads with,
so we'd creep in and there was like a 

76
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:54,894
drop off on this lake,
on the Butler chain and like around 

77
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,370
sundown,
just fish would just be right there.

78
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,970
If you get to the drop off,
you could hit them.

79
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,220
I love fishing,
so it's fun.

80
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,790
It's something primal about it.
There's something primal about like when

81
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,020
you catch something and you see it,
like when you're like,

82
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,140
how can I want to go on a gallon?
Then as it's coming up,

83
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,610
you see it in the water.
Like who they are.

84
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,444
It is,
yeah.

85
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,550
Oh my goodness.
It,

86
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,980
I think it goes back to like ancient DNA
or something.

87
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,820
Yeah,
it's,

88
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,310
it's also you just,
you can feel the life on the line,

89
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,600
you know,
you can feel it.

90
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,110
But I was a catch and released.

91
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,320
I used to eat them,
but then I started feeling bad because I

92
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,600
was going out every day.
So I just,

93
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,290
I let them go.
If you really feel bad,

94
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,740
don't catch and release because when you
catch and release a lot of them die.

95
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,200
That's the dirty secret about catch and 
release fishing.

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,553
Kind of creepy because like I went 
salmon fishing and this is really kind 

97
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,460
of brought home to me when I went salmon
fishing,

98
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:47,290
me and the Rx your fear a couple of 
years ago and went up to Alaska and uh,

99
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,690
when we were like write more,
getting up there,

100
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,524
they had turned it into catch and 
release because they have like a salmon 

101
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,520
weird,
you know what a weirder is.

102
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,983
It's like,
um,

103
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,330
they have these,
uh,

104
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,263
sort of a patch pathways that the salmon
have to go through and they set them up 

105
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,784
so they can add,
they can accurately count how many 

106
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,420
salmon go through at any given time.

107
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,100
So they can estimate how strong the 
schools are that are coming upstream and

108
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,140
downstream.
So they can ask teammate pretty,

109
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,960
pretty accurately how many salmon are in
the river,

110
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,850
what the populations are,
how healthy they are.

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,380
So the salmon,
we're there,

112
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,340
it goes right there,
you can see it.

113
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,163
Um,
they got like right before we're going 

114
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,480
up there,
they got poor numbers and uh,

115
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:30,490
it was kind of ironic because the day we
got there,

116
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,324
the numbers were off the fucking charts.
We got there at like one of the best 

117
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,940
days for salmon fishing ever.
But we had to let them all go.

118
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,950
It was real weird.
Um,

119
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,560
but we were catching the shit.
One of them,

120
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,570
they didn't even know,
well,

121
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,780
no,
we couldn't keep any of them.

122
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,580
Um,
we call a rainbow trout.

123
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,500
I got to keep,
that was pretty rare.

124
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,950
You don't really get to any rainbows up 
there.

125
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,380
I put the salmon were giant.
Well,

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,180
we were catching them all day and 
releasing them,

127
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,420
but you release him,
you're like,

128
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,120
that's one of the four grand going 
America,

129
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,313
you know,
you see some fun kills deeper than the 

130
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,910
lifting and stuff like that.
But I felt,

131
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,590
I felt I'll write about my out,
get them,

132
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,910
get them out of the lip.
But you're right.

133
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,790
Sometimes if they swallowed the bait,
if they swallow the bait,

134
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,080
I'd take it.
And you know,

135
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,610
if it was in the lip,
I let it go.

136
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,653
Well,
some fishes don't taste that good 

137
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,210
either.
That's the thing about large mouth bass.

138
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,830
Delicious fish.
Yeah.

139
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:22,831
That's fucking cat food bro.
Like as Kamin Salmon's a delicious fish,

140
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
but a large mouth bass.
It's like,

141
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,740
yeah,
I guess I could eat this.

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,030
Your salt water fish,
man.

143
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,620
I'll keep them.
If they're the right size,

144
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,454
I'll keep them.
You could freeze them whatever they 

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,980
delicious.
But freshwater fish man.

146
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,173
I mean,
except for trout there trout tastes 

147
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:36,964
really good.
Yeah,

148
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,650
that's a,
is that brackish water?

149
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,671
No.
Um,

150
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,550
most trout are fresh water,
but uh,

151
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,393
there are some brackish water,
like steelheads I think you'd go into 

152
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:46,120
the ocean,
you know,

153
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,043
isn't that correct?
I think steelheads make it into the 

154
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,264
ocean.
Um,

155
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,170
or they get at least close to it.
Definitely get into brackish water.

156
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,620
Salmon of course.
Go back and forth.

157
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,790
He's still fish out here.
Yeah,

158
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,140
man,
I love fishing.

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,920
Um,
different places.

160
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,640
Um,

161
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,480
uh,
there's uh,

162
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,760
for freshwater there's Lake castaic 
which is nice.

163
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,260
They have a lot of actual,
uh,

164
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,750
they actually striped bass,
which are great.

165
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,920
It's all fresh water.
It's,

166
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,630
it's,
it's kind of an artificial lake.

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,793
Um,
but right now they're hurting because 

168
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,250
this drought that we've had up here for 
the last few years,

169
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,180
like it used to,
we used to film fear factor up there and

170
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,830
uh,
especially there's this plate called to,

171
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,600
to hone ranch.
This is the most shocking.

172
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
There's this place called the home ranch
that had this beautiful lake for large 

173
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,184
mouth bass and we used to drop people on
fear factor at a helicopters in this 

174
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:32,000
lake.
Now the lake is completely dry.

175
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,700
There is nothing in the lake.
It's dead,

176
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,970
totally dry,
completely flat.

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,270
You could see the bottom of it and it 
was a mass fish die off.

178
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,104
And they said there was some beautiful,
huge 10 plus pound bass that just died 

179
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,170
in that lake of no air,
no water,

180
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,580
no nothing.
That's crazy.

181
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,000
So you to see it in the lake.
It just dead fish everywhere is not,

182
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,880
well now you can't cause all the birds 
picked him off and it's all gone because

183
00:06:55,881 --> 00:07:00,410
it's been like that for over a year.
But it just completely dried up.

184
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,340
No water.
When a lake dries up,

185
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,440
it's just Thanksgiving for birds.
Yeah.

186
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,090
Yeah.
Well for a little while.

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,660
Damn.
Birds get diarrhea.

188
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,120
Sad man.
They must get diarrhea,

189
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,160
right?
They'd probably eat anything.

190
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,580
No birds can date a lot of shit.
I mean,

191
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:18,390
they eat a lot of shit off my patio.
I dropped food.

192
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,470
I throw it out there,
man.

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,220
Seagulls eat anything.
So a how you like him west coast.

194
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,320
Live in baby.
I'm into,

195
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
you know what like fuck the wind still.
Um,

196
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:28,600
yeah,
I'm,

197
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:32,130
I'm way into living out here.
I'm not into the people as much yet.

198
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm still like,
I like New York people.

199
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
I like,
I like haters.

200
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,741
You know what I mean?
New York,

201
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:39,180
I hate us.
You like,

202
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,500
Hey,
I love haters.

203
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,290
I was telling a friend,
New York's got people,

204
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,220
you do well.
People in New York one hates you.

205
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,590
You do well in La,
people just want to work for you.

206
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,071
And I'm like,
get,

207
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,390
oh go away.
Go Away.

208
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:53,220
Cool.
I'd rather you hate me and criticize me.

209
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:55,620
And then I know like what to work on,
you know?

210
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,320
Interesting.
And I like criticism,

211
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:59,640
man.
It just reminds me of my mother.

212
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,300
That's funny man.
So in what,

213
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,200
what?
Like how so like how,

214
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,140
like when you say that New York has more
haters,

215
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,153
like when you're doing,
when you becoming successful in New 

216
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,370
York,
what you felt like,

217
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,890
like it's just a much more criticism.
Much more,

218
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,650
much more scrutiny.
Yeah.

219
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,160
It's never like,
Yo,

220
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,150
you did a great job.
It's like,

221
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,260
Yo,
that was all right man.

222
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,510
That was all right,
but let me tell you what you really need

223
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:24,270
to be doing.
And so people will actually put you on a

224
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,860
things and whatever.
I like criticism.

225
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:26,694
I like feedback.
I like it when it's valid and it's 

226
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:31,050
coming from people that aren't retarded.
Agreed.

227
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,913
That's a problem.
Youtube hate not so much the most 

228
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,070
entertainment.
Well,

229
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,900
here's the thing,
if you ever left a youtube comment,

230
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,790
yeah,
I talked to them all the time.

231
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,360
It's funny if you ever left a youtube 
comment on something other than your own

232
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,160
videos.
Yeah.

233
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,030
Really?
Yeah.

234
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,060
You're rare.
Most peoples,

235
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,150
they watch you two videos and they enjoy
it or they don't enjoy it.

236
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,880
That's it.
They walk away,

237
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,040
they

238
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,040
move on with their life.
You're a rare dude in that case.

239
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,510
Yeah.
I think for the most part,

240
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,344
80% of the feedback's terrible,
but every once in a while a lot of our 

241
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,020
lower thirds on the show,
like the nicknames we use and Shit,

242
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,883
it's like fans in the youtube comments 
leave them and this is all the vice 

243
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,000
stuff on the vice stuff.
On longs world.

244
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:12,591
Yeah.
Right.

245
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:13,424
So they give me,
they give me good suggestions and I'll 

246
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:18,240
keep in touch with some of the people I 
talk to on Youtube or instagram.

247
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,980
Commoners are pretty fucking good now 
too.

248
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,873
Well,
except when they have their accounts 

249
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:22,824
blocked.
It seems to me that like if you look at 

250
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:25,974
90% of the comments on instagram when 
you go to their accounts that blocked 

251
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,100
the cowards.
Yeah.

252
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,170
Instagram is the land of the cowards.
Cause you can't do that shit.

253
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,213
Like you can't comment on someone else's
stuff in most forms unless they can go 

254
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,830
to your stuff and look at you put an 
Instagram,

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,713
they allow you that option.
And I think that they should take it 

256
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,670
away.
They should take it away.

257
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,770
It should be,
you should own up to the things you were

258
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,300
saying.
Well here's my feeling.

259
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,070
If you,
if you're going to be private,

260
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,083
you shouldn't be allowed to comment.
Like if you're going to be private on 

261
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,384
Instagram,
you shouldn't be allowed to just go on 

262
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,970
other people's pages and shit all over 
them.

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,571
Yeah.
Cause I've,

264
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:58,404
I've read Sangria but just mean nasty 
fucking shit that people write on these 

265
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,970
girls pages about what the girls look 
like.

266
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,550
And I'm like well what does this mother 
fucker look like?

267
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,593
Then I go,
cause all I could see of your face is 

268
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,260
this like one eighth of a centimeter 
face.

269
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,050
And so then I go to their page and it's 
blocked.

270
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,780
I'll see on homegirls like pages and 
stuff,

271
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,830
there's dudes are just like,
oh,

272
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,650
I want to come under titties and she's 
like eating with our grandmother.

273
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,180
Do you know what I mean?
Look,

274
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,043
a lot of it,
a rude comment on the dumplings or 

275
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,500
something.
That's what I'm saying.

276
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,150
Yeah.
Well,

277
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:27,984
grandma had a nice dump look over there.
Especially if we're worried that the 

278
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,134
grandma might actually look at the 
picture with her granddaughter and 

279
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,250
Village Fair out there trying to come 
on.

280
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:40,020
My granddaughter's did.
Luckily my parents are only on facebook.

281
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,980
My parents are fucking killing facebook 
now.

282
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:44,610
They see facebook is the most 
transparent.

283
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,533
You can go right to someone's page and 
you see exactly who they are and that's 

284
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:48,834
a different animal.
You know the the instagrams weird in 

285
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:52,434
that way.
Like some people don't even have a 

286
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,300
photo,
you know,

287
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,550
you'd go to their instagram pages,
no photo.

288
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,620
Yeah,
it's all blocked up.

289
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,650
But then they just use it to comment on 
people's pages and shit on them.

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,810
Youtube and instagram.
Like I said,

291
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,270
80% of it's terrible,
but it's always entertaining.

292
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,020
It's fucking super fucking entertaining.
Sometimes it's not an entertaining to me

293
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,630
because I feel like there's so much 
spinning your wheels.

294
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,613
I like these,
these people that are like super mega 

295
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:18,180
negative on these things like this.
You're not getting it.

296
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:21,300
No one's getting anywhere with this 
people with lives,

297
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,463
but there's some good fucking jokes.
There's some comedians in the comments 

298
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,100
been oh yeah,
definitely.

299
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,110
They got some fucking joke.
It's not all negative.

300
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,520
Yeah,
definitely not all negative,

301
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,710
but as far as like comments,
I would say like,

302
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,080
oh well instagram comments get to a good
joke.

303
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,630
I like it.
I'll go through miles of shit.

304
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,780
I would say instagram comments are 
probably the best out of all [inaudible]

305
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,720
and Paul.
Twitter's pretty God damn good too.

306
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,733
I mean I'm real fortunate in that.
I would say that more than 99% of all 

307
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,200
the interactions I have with people 
online through social media or positive,

308
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,100
more than 99% it's probably

309
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
like 99.9 it's really good cause people 
love you.

310
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,320
Mine is probably,
I think like 70 30 people love you to,

311
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,803
come on dude,
I put you up on instagram today and 

312
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,680
people went crazy.
They super happy to have you back.

313
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,514
Thank you.
Take [inaudible] found out your 

314
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,360
fisherman shirt was rocking it to ice.
Why Susan?

315
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:14,260
Gods?
You win a fitbit.

316
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,530
What the fuck is going on?
Fuck is going on.

317
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,364
My toast has got to get to the CONTOSO.
You know you're not going to get to get 

318
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,480
close with a rubber band.
What do you eat?

319
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,870
Well,
I had a smoothie this morning.

320
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,913
What was in it?

321
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,350
There's no sugar.
It was just Alvin butter and Spirulina.

322
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,960
Oh.
Oh well you're coughing.

323
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,240
Just thinking about it.
The coffee man,

324
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,090
coffee got me the eye guys.
Spirit lead about protein powder.

325
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,140
Alman butter fucking dates.
That's all good.

326
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,560
Well the almond milk almond milk from a 
store with a gang of sugar in it.

327
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,410
I don't know.
So I didn't ask.

328
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,360
See,
I'm new to this ketosis game,

329
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,040
right?
I was just getting into it.

330
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,874
I'm a rookie with,
well that ain't gonna make it most 

331
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,890
almond milk that you buy from stores 
unless you look real careful.

332
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,600
Like if you buy like vanilla almond 
milk,

333
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,463
it's bullshit.
You might as well be just drinking a 

334
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,050
chocolate shake.
Oh yeah,

335
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
this they're,
they're low.

336
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,660
Dunkin called me up,
dude.

337
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,120
I love almond milk.
It's the best man.

338
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,070
It's so delicious.
It's really good for you.

339
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,210
I go,
it's delicious.

340
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,043
Huh?
Um,

341
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,360
how many grams of sugars in it?
Oh,

342
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,200
I don't know.
Hold on.

343
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,230
19 I go,
yeah dude,

344
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:23,320
you're drinking sugar water,
drinking a glass of fucking,

345
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,154
by the way,
that's an eight ounce glass drinking 

346
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,530
eight ounces.
One of those idiots,

347
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,940
man.
I'll wear this fitbit.

348
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll tell myself I'm going to get in 
shape and eat healthy all day.

349
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,930
And then last night I got,
I got drunk and I ended up eating like a

350
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,600
bag of chips and SMURF gummies,
you know,

351
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,180
so that's not,
that's not the ketosis.

352
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,050
Alcohol too.
Alcohol translates directly and sugar in

353
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:44,884
your body or transforms.
But I'd just like to tell myself that 

354
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,550
I'm trying,
well,

355
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:50,410
what are you trying to do?
You're just trying to be healthier.

356
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,900
You're trying to lose weight.
I would like to go down a cup size.

357
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,160
A cut.
Yeah.

358
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,430
Kind of be like,
I'm like a 34 B,

359
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,050
you know Standard Cup size.

360
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,520
I'd like to be an a and a yeah.
If I could get to like 32 A.

361
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,354
I think it helped my basketball game 
cause I got the dream killers now bro 

362
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,180
down mbdl with the MTDL that the NBA 
Development League you see?

363
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah.
Like anybody can,

364
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,720
anybody could see you could try out.
That's not going to work.

365
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:24,500
Come on.
My dream is I think you got a little run

366
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:29,260
our test and use some better way.
I'm going to go down a cup size of trial

367
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,580
for the oh man.
Hmm.

368
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,700
Okay.
Do this.

369
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,563
Do you play a lot of basketball?
I played a lot of basketball and 

370
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,950
watching the knicks this year.
I just,

371
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,540
I feel like I could do some things for 
them.

372
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,560
Addiction is so fucking terrible.
Yeah,

373
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,680
I could watch it and be terrible.
If they're in New York they have money.

374
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,270
Right.
It's a giant ass team.

375
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,293
Cause,
I mean there's a lot of bad things you 

376
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:53,600
can buy with money like Carmelo Anthony.
Oh see bad,

377
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,150
terrible.
It makes me,

378
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,650
he had a good year this year,
but it's just like he,

379
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:58,484
he,
he,

380
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,490
he's not terrible.
It's,

381
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:03,080
he's a bad fit for this team because he 
needs to be on a winner.

382
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,780
And I'm like,
he reassigned with the knicks knowing it

383
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,320
was rebuilding team and he should be,
he should have gone to Chicago.

384
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,513
I want us,
she'd gone to Chicago or we should have 

385
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,304
traded Carmelo for Blake Griffin.
That would have helped the clippers and 

386
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:15,864
it would have helped the next,
this is a lot of technical talk and I'm 

387
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,640
not really bad.
Not really hip to all right.

388
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,940
We'll move on to,
so you're just trying to be healthier is

389
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,340
where you're trying to do.
Um,

390
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,400
and you try to like a hoop dreams chill.
You do have what we still believe,

391
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,240
I still play ball.

392
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,340
I go to Ucla,
a play at ucla,

393
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:34,370
play at USC and I go to Montecito 
heights rec center.

394
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,630
Monday,
Wednesday,

395
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,640
Fridays I got open run Montecito 
Heights.

396
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,474
Where's that?
It's like Pasadena or drive an hour 

397
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,840
every Monday,
Wednesday,

398
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,120
Friday mornings to go play ball.
Really?

399
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,620
I love it.
Wow.

400
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,340
Yeah.
Cause I all 30 like last year I was 30 I

401
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:52,820
just turned 34 like last month and last 
year was the first year I was like,

402
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,610
Yo,
I actually got a lot worse at basketball

403
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:59,480
because I was getting incrementally 
better and I was like,

404
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:01,130
Yo,
I think I'm getting old.

405
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,100
This was the first year I felt old.
I guarantee you it's just because you're

406
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,934
busy.
34 it's not old enough where your body 

407
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:09,290
starts deteriorating.
Do you lift weights?

408
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,460
Yeah,
I do weights.

409
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,030
I do.
I apply on metrics.

410
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,023
Isometrics.
That's kind of doc can fuck with your w 

411
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,360
a basketball game bat in a bad way.

412
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,660
I used to fuck with my pool game.
It was a big problem that I like to lift

413
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,494
weights,
but I also like to play pool and when 

414
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,714
you lift a lot of weights,
you get sore and when you're sore and 

415
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,740
stiff it fucks with your fine motor 
skills.

416
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,980
It would really fuck with my pool game.
Yeah.

417
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,550
No,
my jumpers trash right now.

418
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,473
Yeah.
I think a lot of that has to do with 

419
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:33,944
lifting weights.
It could work for a lot of people when 

420
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:36,164
you're sore and you're like why all the,
you know how like I guess I don't play 

421
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,640
basketball.
I'm and I'm terrible at it.

422
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:45,200
But I would imagine that it's similar to
pool in that you got to know exactly how

423
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,360
much effort to put on that ball.
Yeah,

424
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,560
exactly.
You know,

425
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,800
I know like when a crumple up the paper 
and I throw it in a Trashcan,

426
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,820
it's a weird thing.

427
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,190
Right?
Cause you kind of estimating the drop,

428
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,750
you know the arc of that little thing.
You have to have this fine sense.

429
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,270
I'm a send this video to everyone on my 
squad and be like,

430
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,340
guys you got to give me the Baltimore 
shoot.

431
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm just missing shots cause I'm too 
strong now.

432
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,540
Lived in too many ways to switch over is
not wet too swollen to school.

433
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm way too small for this game.
It does fine.

434
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,853
I mean this is a,
there's a like sort of a point of 

435
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,304
diminishing returns when it comes to 
lifting weights and then doing fine 

436
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:23,350
motor skill activities.
Yeah,

437
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,343
he used to fuck with me drawing too.
If I lift a lot of ways my hands would 

438
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,004
get tired from like gripping and 
squeezing things and then when I would 

439
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,690
draw like my fine motor skills with my 
hands would be off.

440
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,770
It's true.
It does.

441
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,570
It does.
It affects it a lot.

442
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,720
Our team,
we had this team called the molly boys,

443
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,670
so that was my rectum.
Molly boys like they're all,

444
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:48,671
the boys were all on molly all met 
hanging out doing molly and then we make

445
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,050
what an

446
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,883
athletic crew.
A lot of edits you very positive squad 

447
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,940
closet and squat,
but he's hugging everybody.

448
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,811
Yeah,
it's okay.

449
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,870
Did he miss me a hug bro?
Go.

450
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:03,300
We lose by 30 it's cool bed.
I love the pockets.

451
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,340
Yeah,

452
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,173
we look like fucking clowns are jerseys 
had like molly ringwald face on him and 

453
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,624
it said,
mom,

454
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,150
there is,
please show me.

455
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:16,420
I want to put that shit on online.
You got to fucking join the squad.

456
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,150
Joe Donnelly,
boy's Jersey.

457
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,750
Amen.
Come on.

458
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,793
I think.
I think I might even have one in the 

459
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:22,774
fucking backseat of my car.
[inaudible] boy's Jersey with your name 

460
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,650
all over.
We need to have that.

461
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:27,484
You're going to after the show,
you got to give me that photo and I'm 

462
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:32,170
going to put it on instagram.
Satisfies God damn hilarious.

463
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,180
Yo,
my boy Bernard designed this shit.

464
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,200
Molly boys.
Yes.

465
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,830
Here it is.
Look at these jerseys.

466
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,130
Oh my God.

467
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,690
Yeah.
What happened to her man?

468
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,320
I don't,
uh,

469
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,233
she's been in a couple films.
I saw her in something in the news 

470
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,460
recently,
but not,

471
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,760
I don't know what happened,
man.

472
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,840
That's a weird world.
She peaked that peak,

473
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,683
Bro.
The eighties movie world is a weird 

474
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,324
world.
I'm surprised that people sell in press 

475
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:02,904
pills.
Haven't put her face on like oppress 

476
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,530
pill yet.
That would,

477
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,613
that would sell like wildfire.
Anybody out there and making pressed 

478
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,830
pills in your bathtub.
Monitoring Wells face on them.

479
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,640
I know,
right?

480
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,130
You would think that would be the one 
people forgot about her.

481
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,510
People forgot about mt got about home.
You should sell those.

482
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,050
You should sell those.
I forgot a lot of holes.

483
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,230
Yeah,
I,

484
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,670
you know what?
This is for the love.

485
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,230
I'm only giving them the friends like 
you.

486
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,800
You get them in the trunk.
One left.

487
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,880
Oh my God.
What size you are spoken.

488
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,070
Swole.
He might be too for the chairs.

489
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,730
I'm hanging up on the wall,
man.

490
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,481
Dude,
I'll wear it.

491
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:43,480
I'll stretch it out.
Make it a Jamaica tank top.

492
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,840
Make it something.
My only word.

493
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,683
That gym.

494
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,990
I like it.
So you're doing that three times a week.

495
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,670
You're playing basketball.
That's dedication.

496
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,220
I would think to that alone.
All that activity.

497
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,930
That would be a great way to lose 
weight.

498
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,940
Yeah.
My fitbit says I'm doing work.

499
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,980
It's great.
The fitbit in the scale.

500
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,470
Disagree though.
What's the food?

501
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,050
Definitely the food.
It's food.

502
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,810
My job.
But you make delicious shit.

503
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,250
How hard is it when you make delicious 
shit to eat non delicious shit.

504
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,263
That's a problem because it's almost 
like as like imagine for a guy like me 

505
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,120
as a comic.
What if I was a comic,

506
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,520
but the only way to be healthy it was to
listen to shitty jokes.

507
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,840
Oh,
guts.

508
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,750
Kind of like what's going on because you
describe yourself as sandwich artist.

509
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,390
Ultimately what you are is uh,
an Ileus subway employee

510
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,323
full time.

511
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,170
It's,
well there's a lot of jared jokes.

512
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:41,900
No,
but I'm going to,

513
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,140
we're going to keep moving.
But you,

514
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,470
you're making delicious art,
you know,

515
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,100
and then

516
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,100
you're eating styrofoam,
you know?

517
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,400
Yes.
My problem also is I make fire,

518
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,430
I eat it,
but then later on at night,

519
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,230
even if,
if I'm not making,

520
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I will eat anything you put anything 
from,

521
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm going to eat it.
So you're a late night dude.

522
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,523
Late night is where I really do the 
damage and then the booze to the booze 

523
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,350
is a problem.
But I've been drinking less,

524
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,660
drinking less,
just smoking weed,

525
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,120
you know,
I think I'm going to get there.

526
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,610
What next time I come in here,
the mill shredded boost,

527
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,940
Hattie.
Oh,

528
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,330
oh.
Where's the beach?

529
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,630
So if you,
if you just cut out carbs,

530
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,703
you can still eat delicious shit.
Like that's the beautiful thing about 

531
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,690
like trying to get into a ketogenic 
diet.

532
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,820
There's like delicious steaks you can 
eat,

533
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,480
you can eat some sweet potatoes,
you can eat like slinky sweet potatoes.

534
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,910
Yeah,
just fiber,

535
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,380
but just don't eat too much.

536
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,233
The,
the whole idea is to take in as little 

537
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:50,380
sugar as possible and have your body 
start operating off of fats.

538
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,620
And what else is a good fiber to eat 
besides sweet potato?

539
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:55,900
Like what do you do for your cravings?
That's what's killing me.

540
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,270
Discipline.
That's what I do.

541
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,230
Fuck this stuff is uh,
this,

542
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,220
this stuff is called [inaudible].
This is a,

543
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,750
these are x xed exogenous ketones.
These are all minerals in a minute.

544
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,643
Amino acids.
And I add these to water and what they 

545
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:13,480
do is they put your body in a state of 
ketosis pretty rapidly.

546
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,390
They've wait,
this can put you in Ketosis by itself.

547
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,780
So somebody was telling me this,
right?

548
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,490
They're like,
if you don't eat carbs,

549
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,660
that your body creates key totes and 
then it starts to eat your fat.

550
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,773
And I was like,
can I just fucking do a line of fucking 

551
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:29,350
Ketos though?

552
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,183
Like,
why can't you just put these fuckers in 

553
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,980
your body and it starts attacking your 
fat?

554
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,750
Um,
that's what this does.

555
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,280
Well,
what that does is keep,

556
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,100
those are exogenous ketones and ketones 
is what your body burns off and it's not

557
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:42,934
burning off carbohydrates.
There's a couple of benefits to it and 

558
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm not a scientist and I'm not that 
smart so I'm going to butcher this,

559
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,170
but essentially one of the biggest 
benefits is that when you,

560
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,790
when your body's eating carbs all the 
time,

561
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,624
your body feeds off carbs.
For me at least what I would do is I'd 

562
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:59,014
have these big peaks and then these 
crashes like I would eat and then after 

563
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:07,831
I ate I was like a bear that got shot 
with a tranquilizer dart or and seals,

564
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:12,850
bears or collar and Debbie May.
I just,

565
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,870
it would crash hard,
man hard and then also after I ate about

566
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,784
five hours later,
I'd be fucking starving where my body 

567
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,220
had processed all the food and then I'd 
hit this place like,

568
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:25,420
fuck,
I got to eat.

569
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,613
I don't get there anymore.
I don't get to there to that I got to 

570
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:33,940
eat thing like I can go 10 12,
14 hours without eating and I'm fine.

571
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:34,774
I might be a little hungry,
but I feel good like I've worked out 

572
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:39,760
after 16 hours of not eating and be 
fine.

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,833
Like what I'll do is I'll go to bed 
early at an early at nine and I'll work 

574
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:44,794
out at noon with nothing.
Eat nothing in between that time and 

575
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:48,464
work out at noon and be fine.
But what we sound like the girls I knew 

576
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,044
in high school though,
I could go 16 hours without eating 

577
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,850
frozen yogurt up.
Yo,

578
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,780
this is also time Al Bundys favorite 
flavor,

579
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,660
natural orange.
I remember when he made,

580
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,720
if you eat an orange to taste anything 
like this dog shit,

581
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,910
throw the fucking thing in the garbage 
immediately.

582
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,070
The purpose of cogenic still.

583
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,120
If I did the Bundy and I made like a 
Tang sandwich with the cogenic span.

584
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:14,960
Exactly.
Okay.

585
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,120
Yeah.
You don't want to do,

586
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,340
but I do love this stuff.
I put the stuff in,

587
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,560
um,
in water and I mix it up,

588
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,040
drink it all the time,
showing this gets a little sloppy.

589
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,130
This envelopes a little sloppy.
I need to come up with a good,

590
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:29,570
uh,
sort of a,

591
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,150
um,
like a funnel to get it in there.

592
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,460
But what I do is I just kind of shake it
in slow.

593
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,810
Yeah.
You're smart man.

594
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:36,644
You're doing a little one.
What I do is I make a little hole and I 

595
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,230
just put that little hole over the water
bottle.

596
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,560
You probably should use an actual glass 
of water and said,

597
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,300
oh,
this is,

598
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,460
this isn't enough water.
No,

599
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,780
it's fine.
It's good.

600
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,310
I mean it's just going to be real 
strong.

601
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,473
But I'm just saying if you had a glass 
and you could mix that bitch up solid 

602
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,800
like this Joe Rogan glass here.

603
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,990
Plus I liked the idea.
You drinking in my face.

604
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,530
Yeah.
Drinking a Mug of my face.

605
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,533
So,
um,

606
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,950
how long have you been trying to do 
this?

607
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:12,110
Be Healthy and uh,
30,

608
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:16,310
40 years.
It hasn't really worked.

609
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,833
You just got to write down that you 
don't allow yourself to drink at night 

610
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,090
or allow yourself to eat shitty food at 
night.

611
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,440
If you could just do that.
Yeah,

612
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,690
I started keeping it out of the crib.
And then the good thing is,

613
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,560
you know how La really helps fat people 
is there's no bodegas.

614
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,410
See in New York,
it's like you could just walk downstairs

615
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,390
and be fat,
eat anything you want.

616
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:36,224
That's true.
And I missed the day cause that was the 

617
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,120
big thing.
But in la there are,

618
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,410
they've taken the Bodegas away.
Yeah.

619
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,020
New York City.
Yeah.

620
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:43,854
In New York City has a lot of weird 
spots where you can just show up and 

621
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,143
well in New York City has restaurants 
that are open 24 hours a day that are 

622
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,000
really good.
Yeah,

623
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,470
that's crazy.
Incredible.

624
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,540
He has a few,
but they're super ethnic.

625
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,060
Like you can go to Thai town and you can
get some off fucking at nighttime.

626
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,930
There's some fucking Badass Thai food 
that's opened up in La.

627
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,980
If you,
uh,

628
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,350
take,
um,

629
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,630
Hollywood or sunset,
um,

630
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,913
Hollywood,
if you take Hollywood down and keep 

631
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:13,650
going east,
there's a,

632
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,680
so that is not orange.
It's what I'm saying.

633
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,120
Someone needs to go to jail for lying.
I will call that barn set.

634
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,720
You go out there.
Well Take Hollywood,

635
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,000
um,
east of,

636
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,490
of highland.
Keep going.

637
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,503
And on the right hand side,
maybe like four or five miles is like a 

638
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,810
whole tie area that um,
you'll go through like these uh,

639
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,183
these,
these areas where it's maybe like 20 or 

640
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:43,500
30 Thai restaurants in a row down there 
and there's one place open.

641
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,100
I'll take you down

642
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,933
there man.
If you want to go.

643
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,680
I'm just one place that's open.
Late at night.

644
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:49,170
I used to go with my buddy rob.
Rob came in,

645
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,033
world kickboxing champion and um,
he took me down to that place after 

646
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,870
training one night.
It's fantastic.

647
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,670
And it's open till like two,
three o'clock in the morning.

648
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,620
What's the name?
I don't remember the name of the place.

649
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,400
Cause it's like some funky name.
Yeah,

650
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,100
I've been going to Thai town to this 
spot.

651
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,510
Stop.
Coffee shop is good,

652
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:05,310
but they're not 24 hours.
They're good though.

653
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,970
With Thai coffee is hilarious because I 
mean just why don't you just shoot sugar

654
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:09,804
into my veins with a needle?
You know like Thai iced tea and Thai 

655
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:15,540
iced coffee.
That stuff is insane.

656
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,640
They put sugar and condensed milk.
Yeah,

657
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,020
like one wasn't enough.
Yeah.

658
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,150
It's double sugared up.
It's so yummy.

659
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:21,984
Right?
When someone does the organic tie spot 

660
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,563
or or whatever,
it's going to be sugar condensed milk 

661
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,020
and the Gavi,
that's what they're going to do.

662
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,090
A Golf I supposed to be super bad for 
you.

663
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,343
Oh yeah.
Well everybody thinks that a Gaba is 

664
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,740
like,
it's all natural man.

665
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,160
It's a Gaba.
Gaba is really good.

666
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,300
A Gavi is apparently converted into your
body.

667
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,090
Just like sugar.
Like just like cane sugar.

668
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,613
If you don't know,
I never thought it could be too great 

669
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:49,500
for you too though.
Cause it's like,

670
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,080
it looks like it's made from the same 
thing they make Tequila from.

671
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,500
So I'm like right.
Kill bad for you.

672
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,920
It could be good.
It could be depends on who you're with.

673
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,990
A long term bet short term.
Incredible.

674
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,730
It's a trade off again,
it depends on the company you keep,

675
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,630
you know.
So this stuff exotic,

676
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,700
just ketones.
This is the way to go.

677
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,930
It's good to do a little pick me up in 
between meals too.

678
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,853
I feel hot.

679
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,980
Hot,
like sexy.

680
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,420
Yeah.
Real fucking thing.

681
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,780
Like real skinny.
Yeah.

682
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,330
Real fucking hot boy over here.
The skinny look.

683
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,470
Yeah,
it's coming back.

684
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,190
Bringing it back.
Mine's mainly for basketball man.

685
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,330
But also I've been a human panda for a 
while.

686
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:37,090
I'd like to be a human red panda.
They're a little more athletic and agile

687
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,790
and pandas and see them in trees and 
shit.

688
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,913
They climb kind of jealous.
I'm like the fat fucking panda stuck to 

689
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,010
the floor.
Do you have a trainer?

690
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,090
Yeah,
I do.

691
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,440
Really do.
I've been training with this.

692
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,580
This,
this dude Justin.

693
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:48,610
He's good.
Okay.

694
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,910
Yeah.
He started this gym called lip method.

695
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,970
It's been pretty good going.
What kind of Shit do you do?

696
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,010
Well,
as a isometrics,

697
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:56,844
plyometrics,
and then sometimes I'll do weights and 

698
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,690
then I play ball.
So that's kind of like the four things I

699
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:02,400
do you ever fuck with kettle bells?

700
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

701
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,270
Kettle bells are good.
I do the Kettlebell swings and shit like

702
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,590
that,
and then step ups,

703
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,850
we kettlebells,
right?

704
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,140
Yeah.
I like kettle bells.

705
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,590
I feel like you got to get to a level of
buffing this for kettle bells,

706
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:15,630
but I do.
I know you can start with light ones.

707
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

708
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,483
The right way to do this is a 
interesting podcasts that I've been 

709
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:21,810
listening to with this guy,
Pavel,

710
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:23,250
tat saline.
He's,

711
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:24,084
I'm like,
sir,

712
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,520
the guy brought kettle bells to America 
and he's on a Tim Ferriss,

713
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:32,200
his podcast,
I want to say number 55 or one 55 yeah,

714
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:34,670
I just found it last night.
If you'd told me about this back in this

715
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,770
catalog,
but trout around the 50 50 or 55 right?

716
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:38,604
Yeah.
Yeah.

717
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,250
He's to two podcasts in a row and he 
talks

718
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,210
about like the correct way to do kettle 
and the correct way to strength train,

719
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,463
and one of the things that he's saying 
is you should never do more than five 

720
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,034
repetitions.
You should like say if you can lift 

721
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,790
something,
if you have a 100 pounds,

722
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,620
you can lift a hundred pounds nine 
times.

723
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,543
You shouldn't do it nine times.
She should do it five due at five and 

724
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:00,670
then put it down.
Don't,

725
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,504
don't go to failure.
And the idea is the body's not designed 

726
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:04,354
to go to failure.
The idea is that going to failure all 

727
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:06,880
the time.
You think like,

728
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,250
we have this idea in our head,
and I'm guilty of it more than anybody,

729
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,020
is that more is better.
You know,

730
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:11,854
I'm going to fucking work harder than 
everybody else and that's just going to 

731
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:14,291
do it.
Well,

732
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,124
that's not really the right way to do it
when it comes to the human body because 

733
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:19,600
the,
even though your mind can push your body

734
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:23,230
to extreme limits,
oftentimes you get better results by not

735
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:26,470
pushing your body to extreme limits by 
pushing your body intelligently,

736
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,453
allowing your by your body's sufficient 
time to recover and then doing it again 

737
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,630
and then doing it more often,
but with less repetitions.

738
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,810
So this is the thing I,
I've been joking around like,

739
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,010
oh,
lose weight is that,

740
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,570
it's true.
I want to do it for basketball.

741
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,404
But the thing I love about working out 
and basketball is it teaches you shit 

742
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,130
like this,
right?

743
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,640
Cause I think everything in the universe
has the same principles.

744
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,773
Do you know what I mean?
Like if you're cooking more is not 

745
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,540
always better,
right?

746
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,940
If you're making music more is not 
always better.

747
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,980
Right?
Like putting more things into a beat.

748
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,400
You need negative space,
right?

749
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,303
Things need space,
time to breathe and then so does the 

750
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:03,790
human body.
And so I agree.

751
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,820
I don't do like exercises to fail.
I do them and my train is pretty good.

752
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:10,144
Like we'll go in and we'll do like 18 
different exercises and we switch each 

753
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:13,234
time.
It's not like sets of three and going 

754
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,420
increasing in weight.
You've seen,

755
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm sure you've seen this Jiro dreams of
Sushi.

756
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:19,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

757
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,291
Amazing.
Right?

758
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,120
Yeah.
One of the things that I love about that

759
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:25,600
is the simplicity of this guy's methods.
I mean that the,

760
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,250
if you haven't seen a documentary,
man,

761
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,270
I was so skeptical.
I'm like,

762
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:30,970
I'm not watching a fucking documentary 
about due to make Sushi.

763
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,710
Like how fucking hard is it to make 
Sushi?

764
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,150
Cut the fish,
shut the fuck up.

765
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,620
How hard is that?
It's hard as fuck.

766
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,483
It's hard as hell.

767
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,320
But the,
the methods of this guy,

768
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,660
employees like you would think,
well,

769
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,490
how hard is it to do?
Well,

770
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,324
it's not necessarily that it's hard,
but there's a right way to do it where 

771
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,710
it's,
he's figured out like,

772
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:51,544
do you,
do you add this amount of this or that 

773
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:53,641
amount of this?
Do you,

774
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:55,300
you know,
let it sit for six hours.

775
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:59,290
You let it sit for 12 hours and he's 
nailed it and got it down to a science.

776
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,540
But if you did anything more than what 
he's doing,

777
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,260
it would actually be less.
Yeah.

778
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,020
You know,
like a nice piece of seared.

779
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:07,690
I for example,
how hard is that?

780
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,920
It's not hard at all.
You get a fresh piece of I he,

781
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:11,950
you sear it,
but God damn when it's done right,

782
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:12,940
it tastes good.
Yeah.

783
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,340
Every culture is,
it's similar.

784
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,430
You go eat like the original food,
the traditional food authentic.

785
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,060
Like I went to Sicily,
it just read tuna,

786
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,903
Sicilian red tuna on a griddle,
the best restaurant I went to 

787
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:26,434
insistently who's doing tuna on the 
griddle low heat with olive oil and it 

788
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:34,210
was just salt and it was the best piece 
of two and I ever had.

789
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,170
Wow.
Yeah,

790
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,303
you'll see it's a,
we went to Piccola Napolli this episode 

791
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,100
was good.
They're big on

792
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,080
seafood,
right?

793
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,913
Sicily's hugely is incredible on seafood
and they're very smart because they 

794
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,700
don't add much to it.
They just use their olive oil.

795
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,780
That low heat sear,
real nice take the time is incredible.

796
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,200
Well I think that minimalism in a lot of
ways,

797
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,540
like even in music,
like a,

798
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,550
sometimes you listen to an acoustic 
song,

799
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,384
just a dude in a guitar or a woman in a 
guitar and it's the best song you've 

800
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,750
ever heard.
Yeah.

801
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,583
For that moment.
I mean if there was one more piece of 

802
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,160
fishing equipment on the shirt,
it fucking suck.

803
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,833
It'd be terrible.
There's just a net fishing equipment on 

804
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:12,980
this shirt.
You love that shirt.

805
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:15,250
Do I do.
I do.

806
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,420
It all comes back.
It's all comes back to the shirt.

807
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,950
Tell me about your new vice show man.
What do you got going on?

808
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,813
It's been,
you know what this has been since I've 

809
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,880
met you.
It's been in the works.

810
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,743
It almost,
I feel like it's a five year journey 

811
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,550
really started this idea we and then we 
went through it,

812
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,350
did it on the Internet,
you know,

813
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,213
eight minute clips,
10 minute clips and we did that for two 

814
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:36,914
years and the last two years I haven't 
had any episodes out because we've just 

815
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:42,734
been grinding and we'd been in the lab 
eight episodes and it took us eight 

816
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:46,994
years and I have to give respect.
You know a lot of people look at say 

817
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:51,164
other travel shows or Tony Bourdain and 
you hear a lot of people pitch things 

818
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,540
around town in New York.
Oh yeah.

819
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,050
This is like the new Tony Bourdain or 
that's the Newtonian [inaudible].

820
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,260
You know what we got in the lab and we 
made an hour long travel show.

821
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,183
It's a similar format and you know thing
that Tony is doing because he created 

822
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:12,110
this format and I have to pay respect.
It's hard as fuck.

823
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,333
But what Tony did was he was the first 
guy that ever had a cooking show that I 

824
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:16,580
want to hang out with.
Yes.

825
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,020
And Tony is the first one that put a 
narrative to a cooking show.

826
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,230
He gave it a narrative in a story and 
character.

827
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,064
And so he created this format that a lot
of people have like followed in his 

828
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,700
footsteps.
But I've always felt like,

829
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,901
you know,
when I started,

830
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:33,680
people are like,
oh no,

831
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,513
it's Tony or whatever.
And Tony was really helpful to me in my 

832
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,720
career and he really supported me.
But I was like,

833
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:39,554
you know what?
My purpose in life wasn't to be another 

834
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,524
version of my dad.
My Dad wanted me to work in a steak 

835
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,314
house when I was a kid and just be like,
you own this restaurant after me and 

836
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:49,250
we're going to sell steak.

837
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,450
That's what the wall is doing.
And I was like,

838
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:51,284
Dad,
I don't think that can be the point to 

839
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:53,724
my life.
It can't be just to emulate you and be 

840
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,324
like you.
And when it came to me doing this fight 

841
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:00,134
stuff,
I've been for five years figuring out 

842
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:06,590
how to get my voice and my story and the
things I care about.

843
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:07,424
The translate to tape and it looked,
it maybe looked a lot easier than I 

844
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:12,014
thought it did.
But once you get to it and you start to 

845
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:17,750
see what really makes these shows great,
you want to honor it,

846
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:19,460
you want to respect it and you want to 
work hard.

847
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:22,070
So we took two years to make these eight
episodes.

848
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,230
Wow.
That's a long ass time.

849
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,220
And you know,
I think,

850
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,533
you know,
when you're trying to create a 

851
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:28,214
television show,
it takes a while for a show to find its 

852
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,310
legs,
right.

853
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,050
To figure out what it is.
Yeah.

854
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,943
With anything,
even with the city column or a talk 

855
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,740
show,
you know,

856
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:37,410
I mean,
uh,

857
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,600
I was there for the early days that 
Conan O'brien show.

858
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:42,250
One of my buddies was one of the writers
and I got to see them do it and it's,

859
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,230
it was,
I was,

860
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,460
I remember being there going,
wow,

861
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:47,690
it's going to be interesting to see how 
this works out because this is obviously

862
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,360
lot on Bambi legs right now.
Like it's like,

863
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,120
like a fawn.
Yeah.

864
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,950
My thing was I always had the vision and
I knew what I wanted to do,

865
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,113
so that was part one.
Then the last few years have been 

866
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,590
actually doing it and then once you do 
it,

867
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,550
the hardest part in this town is 
convincing other people that they should

868
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,170
put it out.
You know,

869
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:08,760
because other people look at it and 
they're like,

870
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,710
oh well it's not like,
it's not like Tony and it's not like the

871
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,690
show,
like what is this?

872
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,070
And I'm like just,
it's different.

873
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:14,904
And that's the point because I didn't 
want to go make a show that's like 

874
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,174
anybody else's.
It may be the same time format and you 

875
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:23,040
say 44 minute travel show,
structured,

876
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,480
unstructured reality,
whatever.

877
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,460
But I was like,
this is a new thing.

878
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,000
But it took me a long time to get the 
vision,

879
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,460
create it,
and then get people to believe in it.

880
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,893
You know,
getting people to believe in your shit 

881
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,740
is I think the hardest.
That third step is the hardest part.

882
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,190
Well who did you need to get to believe 
it because you're doing it on advice,

883
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,130
right?
Yeah.

884
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,293
Shane already believes in you and Shane.
Shane is the one that gives me the 

885
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:46,261
freedom.
Shane,

886
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:47,820
Eddie Murray,
they're the ones that let me do it,

887
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,920
you know,
but they're not there every day.

888
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,160
So this is a show runner and there's a 
producer and then all these people,

889
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:56,070
cause we out in Fukushima shooting 
radioactive wolves and shit.

890
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,160
Mother Fucker,
he's the man.

891
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,320
I saw him last night,
Shane's the man and he,

892
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,800
he always gives me the freedom,
but it's,

893
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,570
it's even the people on your crew 
getting everybody to buy in and believe.

894
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,720
And we came back with the footage and 
these things,

895
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,130
it gets into post and then everybody who
gets to watch an and post has an opinion

896
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,260
about what this show should be.
And I just,

897
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,440
I fought and fought and fought all eight
of these episodes.

898
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:23,160
Finally we're going to put them out and 
all eight of them are exactly how I feel

899
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:25,710
about the places I visited and the 
people we met.

900
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,700
And my biggest struggle was travel 
shows.

901
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,593
They voiceover a lot.
There's a lot of voiceover and it's 

902
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:33,924
almost like these shows are written 
before people go to these towns and 

903
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:37,434
these cities and what the people say.
Sometimes it doesn't matter because the 

904
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:41,724
producer,
whoever's going has already decided the 

905
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,180
story wants to tell.

906
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,533
I go out there and we booked the scenes 
and the thing that made everybody 

907
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:51,540
nervous and pre preproduction was I was 
like,

908
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,403
I don't know what these people are going
to say and we're going to live with the 

909
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:54,900
footage.
And they're like,

910
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,280
no,
you have to have an idea.

911
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,380
You have to like direct the 
conversation.

912
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:01,050
We need a write voiceover and we need to
set it up.

913
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,510
And I was like,
let's just go to these towns,

914
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,720
meet these people and let them tell us 
about their lives,

915
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,510
their cities,
their identities and except the footage.

916
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,660
And I think being honest,
accepting footage,

917
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,693
not manipulating the footage with a ton 
of voiceover is the real innovation of 

918
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,310
our show.
It's verite.

919
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,290
You see us making the show,
so it's never like you're not aware of,

920
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,490
we're making a show.
You see what is the,

921
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,750
what is the premise of the show?

922
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm exploring and deconstructing 
identities through what people eat does.

923
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,980
You're basically like going through 
their shit.

924
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,160
Like,
what's in your poop?

925
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,840
You know what I mean?
Fucking red tuna,

926
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:38,800
olive oil,
you know?

927
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,630
But I'm going through these countries 
and exploring their history and identity

928
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,553
just through what they eat.
Because what you eat tells you so much 

929
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,670
about who you are,
your culture,

930
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,780
your values,
your politics,

931
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:52,360
and your history and what has happened 
to your ancestors.

932
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,460
Like where'd you go?
Cecily?

933
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,160
Istanbul.
Yeah.

934
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,690
Hunan.
China.

935
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,501
Sand.
Don't China.

936
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:03,370
Taiwan.
Orlando Juarez.

937
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,260
Mexicali.
You went to Warren?

938
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,760
Yeah.
Went to Juarez.

939
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,950
It was great puzzle.
Very credible.

940
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,120
It's not scary.
You know,

941
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,370
I don't,
I never would oversell it until you,

942
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:14,260
those fucking just fucking scary out 
there.

943
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,220
I mean,
look,

944
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,054
everyone there had a story of somebody 
in their family being killed or 

945
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,230
kidnapped or robbed is bad and you know,
it's bad.

946
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,160
But when we went out there,
I cannot claim that it was hard or rough

947
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:27,994
for us.
We rode bikes through the city and 

948
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:30,724
there's a lot of these kids out there 
doing things trying to take back wall 

949
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:33,504
brass.
So you may look at like a bike ride 

950
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:38,910
through your town here.
I was like some hipster,

951
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,810
weird yuppy thing,
but in Juarez they were like,

952
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,033
we even,
we would just love the right to be 

953
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:44,584
yuppies.
Do you know I have the freedom to be 

954
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:48,940
yuppies and this time we can't even ride
our bikes without a problem here.

955
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,790
So we rode bikes with like 50,
60 kids.

956
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,850
And while that's just kind of civil 
disobedience,

957
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,980
trying to take back the streets by 
riding through them.

958
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,873
So it was it,
when you say they would like to be able 

959
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:00,784
to ride bikes,
like it's just because of the drug 

960
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:02,290
violence.

961
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,900
They does a lot of islands.
There's a lot of violence.

962
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,330
People are afraid to go outside.
And,

963
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,193
um,
this is one of the symbolic things that 

964
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:10,774
the youth out there do if they try to 
take back the city and the town by 

965
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:16,410
riding through it with bikes.
Got Butter coffees.

966
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,253
Got You.
Huh?

967
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,340
Keep another coffee is killing me.
But it's great.

968
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,650
I mean,
so like what kind of food?

969
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,543
Obviously Mexican food,
but like what kind of food we were 

970
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:27,394
getting in wars.
The best food I had was outside the 

971
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:31,774
nightclubs.
There was this one little Taco stand in 

972
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:37,930
Juarez on the main strip that,
you know,

973
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,793
the rolling stones,
whoever used to go perform at the main 

974
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:45,490
venue in Juarez after the show there was
this small taco spot.

975
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,353
All they do is like El Pastore.
You go over there and that was the best 

976
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:49,804
Taco I've ever had.

977
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,990
What does that stand for?
I'll pet store.

978
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,500
What does it mean?
It's uh,

979
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,970
the pastor?
No,

980
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,393
I don't know.
I just know you get pineapples and it's 

981
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:01,660
grilled pork and it's on a spit and it's
incredible.

982
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,910
My thing is usually Tang,
I like language.

983
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,803
I like beef tongue tacos.
But that Al Pastore Taco was the best I 

984
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,770
had.
Wow.

985
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,650
And the rolling stones used to go there.
Yeah,

986
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,110
after the shows and stuff like that.
How long ago were they going to Juarez?

987
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:14,944
Mexico.
It's like in the seventies seventies 

988
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,360
yeah.
Yeah.

989
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,233
And El Paso,
they would do the shows and El Paso and 

990
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,990
then cross over and shit like that.
Really?

991
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,943
Yeah.
So do shows in El Paso and then go to 

992
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,940
Mexico for food and then they also did 
them.

993
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,200
I believe I have to,
I have to catch myself.

994
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,040
I have to check the tape.
I can't remember if

995
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,873
it's,
they did the shows and I'll pass when 

996
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:37,550
went to Juarez,
the party after or it's,

997
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:38,384
they did the show in Juarez and went to 
the Taco stand because they did have a 

998
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:43,550
venue next door to this thing.
So I think at some bands did.

999
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,384
El Paso came over,
some bands did the venue next to the 

1000
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:48,470
Taco spot and went over.
But it was a combination.

1001
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,730
It's crazy.
Rolling Stone was,

1002
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,920
I can't remember if they were El Paso or
warmers,

1003
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,783
but there were tons of bands in that 
triangle going back and forth between 

1004
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:56,444
the border and people would come across 
the board at a party in Juarez and it 

1005
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:01,330
was a thing.
It was no big deal back then.

1006
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,620
That's what's crazy is that when I was a
kid,

1007
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,710
you never heard about violence in Mexico
piece should go to Mexico to party.

1008
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,830
Everybody go to Aqua Poco to go to 
Tijuana.

1009
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,330
Tijuana.
It was just fun.

1010
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,620
I mean,
it was crazy.

1011
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,663
You know,
they would all talk about donkey shows 

1012
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,550
and all the crazy shit that you'd go 
over there and see.

1013
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:17,384
But it was never like,
don't go to Tijuana because of drug 

1014
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:20,774
violence.
Yeah.

1015
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,880
That all happened during the Bush 
administration.

1016
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,250
Yup.
I went to,

1017
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,310
um,
uh,

1018
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,253
Cancun and like a 2002 or something like
that for mtv and MTV did a spring break 

1019
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:35,360
thing down there.
And Man,

1020
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,260
it was,
it was fun.

1021
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:39,920
It was great.
And then within seven or eight years,

1022
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,180
nobody would go.
Yeah,

1023
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,130
I mean,
within seven or eight years,

1024
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:44,870
everybody was terrified.
And going to Mexico,

1025
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:48,200
all you heard in the news,
and I'm sure a lot of it was exaggerated

1026
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,840
and um,
I mean,

1027
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,200
if it bleeds,
it leads,

1028
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,034
right?
If the news is going to show you some 

1029
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,444
shit about Mexico,
it's not going to show you al Pastore 

1030
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,570
Tacos and how great it is on the street.

1031
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,030
The murders are real.
But then the thing is,

1032
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:01,430
is that we have to remember in all these
towns,

1033
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:03,320
you see these murders,
you see the gang violence,

1034
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,030
there's real people living through that 
shit.

1035
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,610
There's real people trying to live 
normal lives.

1036
00:43:07,611 --> 00:43:10,700
And that's why we did this episode on 
the border towns in Mexico.

1037
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,850
We went to Tijuana,
Mexicali and Juarez,

1038
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,103
and we tried to show the lives that 
these people are trying to live next to 

1039
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:19,934
a superpower because just by the sheer 
nature and geography of them living on 

1040
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:25,664
the border next to a superpower,
of course crime is going to leak into 

1041
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:29,234
their towns.
The dirts going to be done on their 

1042
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:31,034
side.
The product's going to be sent to our 

1043
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:32,840
side,
you know?

1044
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,173
And so we tried to capture their lives.
And so that's an example of one episode 

1045
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:38,150
of the show.
Well,

1046
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:39,403
the other problem is they're like sort 
of see their economies completely 

1047
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:42,884
connected to the United States and a lot
of ways where it's like there's plenty 

1048
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,800
of violence in America that we don't 
even consider.

1049
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:52,610
Like nobody's scared to go to Chicago,
but Chicago is fucked up,

1050
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:53,444
man.
There's more gun violence in Chicago 

1051
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:58,520
than almost anywhere in North America in
Chicago is terrible right now.

1052
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,970
It's,
it's definitely an American life.

1053
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,390
It's the most murders in any cities.
It's cool.

1054
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,330
It's right up there.
I think it's Chicago and Detroit,

1055
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,590
but no one's like,
oh my God,

1056
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:09,380
we can't go to Chicago on the South 
Chicago,

1057
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:10,070
you know,
hey,

1058
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,730
let's go to Chicago.
It's,

1059
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,790
we don't even consider it.
Yeah,

1060
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:14,624
it's all in the south side.
But I mean that's sort of the same way 

1061
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,900
people have to look at about Mexico.
But I'll do,

1062
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:22,970
I do have tie this one story.
I went to this resort recently in Mexico

1063
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,490
near Puerto Vallarta and I was like,
wow,

1064
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:26,780
this place is so pretty.
Like,

1065
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,930
how is it that Mexico has all this drug 
violence and all these problems,

1066
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:30,740
but uh,
this,

1067
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,920
this beautiful resort

1068
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,350
and all these a wealthy people go to 
vacation,

1069
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,213
this resort and they had these little 
golf carts that they give you on the 

1070
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:38,634
resort to move around the resort.
And we took the golf cart and they'll 

1071
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:42,570
like,
you can go into the city if you like,

1072
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:43,404
you know,
you could take the golf carts anywhere 

1073
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:44,401
you want.
It's like,

1074
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:45,420
all right,
let's go into the city.

1075
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,463
So we go into the city and we went a 
block from that resort one block and we 

1076
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:52,734
found a fucking small military based 
with armored vehicles with dude sitting 

1077
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,614
on their,
on machine guns with steel plates in 

1078
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,750
front of them,
ready to rock at a moment's notice.

1079
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:08,160
So that's how they keep these wealthy 
people like protected.

1080
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:08,671
I was like,
wow,

1081
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:11,730
this is a wake up call right here.
And that's the thing that like,

1082
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,470
our leaders never do a good job of that 
violence in the south side of Chicago.

1083
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,870
That should affect all Americans,
but it doesn't.

1084
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,003
And until it affects somebody who 
doesn't live in the south side and the 

1085
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,860
murder accidentally bleeds into the 
wrong neighborhood on the north side,

1086
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,470
nobody really cares.
Nobody pays attention.

1087
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:29,304
And that's why we went to Mexico too,
because there's this border that is a 

1088
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:34,640
false border.
Like Mother Nature didn't put a board in

1089
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,690
there.
We put a fucking pillow.

1090
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,480
No.
Gotcha.

1091
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,313
That border Sun,
God made the border between United 

1092
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,090
States and Mexico.
God made it that way.

1093
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,200
God has a plan.
Exactly.

1094
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:46,110
We are the chosen people.
Exactly.

1095
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,600
And so I just wanted to show like,
hey man,

1096
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,940
on the other side of this artificial 
line,

1097
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,833
this is what's going on.
And just because there are different 

1098
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,380
color than you are,
it's a different country.

1099
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,180
It doesn't mean you shouldn't care about
this.

1100
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,014
Like this is a human problem.
Well people are so terrified of opening 

1101
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:03,010
up the bores in Mexico and letting 
people go back and forth there.

1102
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,873
They're so terrified of the idea.
But how many Mexicans are already over 

1103
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,330
here illegally and doesn't seem to be 
that much of a problem.

1104
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,443
And I mean there's plenty of natural 
born Americans that are fucking things 

1105
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:13,764
up just as bad as anybody else.
And most of the Mexicans I know are 

1106
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,780
hardworking people that are very 
friendly.

1107
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,793
Like if you go to Mexico,
one of the things you find like right 

1108
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:25,530
away is how friendly people are.
Mexican is a nice place,

1109
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,240
incredible place.
Nice.

1110
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,080
I never felt threatened or anything.
And the thing is is that the world needs

1111
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,600
more transparency and mobility,
right?

1112
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:34,434
The,
the thing that I noticed for two years 

1113
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,890
traveling around the globe,
going to all these places,

1114
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,113
Mediterranean,
Sicily where there's immigration issues 

1115
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,450
is Stan Bull,
you know,

1116
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Mexico on the borders.
We need transparency because the Po,

1117
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,110
the leaders of this world are drawing 
lines all around creating divisions that

1118
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:52,944
are not there between me and you or 
Jamie or people in the in Mexico that I 

1119
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:56,760
met.

1120
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,593
You know,
and we need to have mobility because it 

1121
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:00,504
can't just be my dumb luck that I was 
born in America and then I'm going to 

1122
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:06,450
have a better life because my mom pop 
the squad here.

1123
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,440
Right.
You know,

1124
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,360
it's sad.
Like I go around the world,

1125
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:09,931
I'm like,
man,

1126
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:10,764
if that person was born here,
they'll probably be doing a better job 

1127
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:13,794
than me.
What I'm doing.

1128
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,530
Well it's eroding.
It's eroding slowly but not,

1129
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,210
not quick enough.
Not Clicking.

1130
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:18,900
No.
What,

1131
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,733
what used to be a necessity,
like we had to keep our tribe away from 

1132
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,480
invading tribes because we couldn't 
communicate with them.

1133
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,523
We didn't know their language.
People came from some other land to try 

1134
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,250
to take our,
we had a protect

1135
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,083
it.
They would come over and boats and 

1136
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:34,150
they'd rape and pillage.
That's not really the case anymore.

1137
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,860
So there's necessity of having these 
borders and,

1138
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:37,694
and,
and especially in 2016 having it where 

1139
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,940
you can't go back and forth,
you can't even cross into lands,

1140
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:46,510
lets you have the right papers and he 
definitely can't work here because you'd

1141
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:47,290
be taking

1142
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,420
jobs.
Yeah.

1143
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,670
Taken our jobs.
There's plenty in the world man,

1144
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,240
like people and,
and the what,

1145
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,660
the 1% got to get better at sharing too,
you know,

1146
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:56,494
cause there's people in the world that 
just sit on piles of shit and it's not 

1147
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,620
in the economy.
It's quite an ecosystem,

1148
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,560
Dave.
And there's,

1149
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,980
there's Middle Eastern.
That's Chinese too.

1150
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,700
Did a lot of Chinese people sitting on 
piles of shit that's not moving well,

1151
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:10,930
that's,
yeah,

1152
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,150
we'll stockpiling wealth is a weird 
thing,

1153
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:13,984
right?
When people get to this point where 

1154
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:15,910
they're just constantly,
well,

1155
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,620
if you have like billions and billions 
of dollars,

1156
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:21,070
but yet you're still involved in 
constantly trying to accumulate wealth,

1157
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,760
that's a little weird too.
I wanted to run this idea by you please.

1158
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,930
I listen to his show and I love the idea
as you bring up,

1159
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,560
I'm convinced and I wished there was a 
politician that was,

1160
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,710
that was promoting this,
but I think there should be a salary cap

1161
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:33,544
on the world.

1162
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,960
A salary,
salary cap,

1163
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,360
because you put it in sports and it 
works.

1164
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,950
Right?
But think about it.

1165
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,813
Do you,
would you ever need more than $500 

1166
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,460
million?
Me?

1167
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah.
Plans to come on.

1168
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,630
I need islands.
Shit.

1169
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
Rocket ships.
I want to go to the moon.

1170
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,910
I feel like you could go to the moon for
under 500 Mil.

1171
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,480
I guarantee you can't,
isn't there that one dude,

1172
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,170
the backstreet boy,
uh,

1173
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,363
Lance Bass,
he's going to go to the moon on a big 

1174
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:00,544
Dick.
Come on.

1175
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,680
But okay,
so you,

1176
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,490
you would need more than 500 mil.
I don't know.

1177
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:07,181
No,
no,

1178
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:08,210
not in real life.
No,

1179
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,333
not if I'm being serious.
But here's how much money would get put 

1180
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:15,010
back into the market and like would be 
distributed.

1181
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,040
If you just set a salary cap at 500 Mil,
well that would break up so much money.

1182
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,670
It's interesting,

1183
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,503
but someone who makes more than $500 
million could take that money and 

1184
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:28,990
started gigantic business and hire 
hundreds of millions of people.

1185
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,880
I mean,
just because,

1186
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,240
do you have a hundred?
You just promote reaganomics bro.

1187
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,853
Trickle down economics is real.
Just like God had us born here in 

1188
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:39,760
America.
God also made it so

1189
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,160
you don't have a salary cap.
Um,

1190
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,690
it,
it's interesting,

1191
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:47,230
but if you play monopoly and which is,
that's what everybody's doing,

1192
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,213
right?
Everybody's,

1193
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,200
there's plenty money.
What's a game?

1194
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,840
I mean there's the gay capitalism in a 
lot of ways.

1195
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:53,674
A lot like a game you're trying to 
accumulate and some people are more 

1196
00:49:56,651 --> 00:50:00,070
dedicated to that game and they try to 
accumulate constantly.

1197
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,780
I mean if I was more dedicated to just 
doing the things that I do,

1198
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,750
if I was more dedicated in a capitalist 
sense,

1199
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:08,584
I would accumulate more money.
But my personal belief is that would 

1200
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:16,000
fuck with me creatively because it would
take away resources that I use for other

1201
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:16,834
things.
It would fuck with the way I do the 

1202
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:19,870
podcast.
If you,

1203
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,180
if you only think about how much money 
you can make,

1204
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:24,850
there's certain things you wouldn't say.
There's certain ways you wouldn't speak.

1205
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,043
And the ironic irony in my that would 
ultimately cost me money cause my 

1206
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:30,044
product would suffer.
So I think in a lot of ways the game of 

1207
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,950
capitalism itself,
just calling it a game,

1208
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,040
um,
it you,

1209
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,363
it's very problematic if you have a cap 
on how much money you can make in that 

1210
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,980
game because there's always going to be 
these outliers.

1211
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:50,000
He's Michael Jordans of sport that take 
things to the fucking end fill level and

1212
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:50,834
go deep and want to make as much money 
as they possibly can and I don't 

1213
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:54,434
necessarily think that that's bad.
I think you should have the freedom to 

1214
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,940
be fucking crazy.
You should have the freedom.

1215
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:00,103
If you want to make,
you want to be the first guy that makes 

1216
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:03,800
$100 billion,
you should have the freedom to do that,

1217
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,520
but as a human being who makes that much
money,

1218
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,623
you also should have a,
an understanding of what kind of an 

1219
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:11,984
impact you can have on other people with
that money from your own personal 

1220
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:18,590
perspective,
you can take that money and invest it in

1221
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:20,930
different communities.
You can start programs,

1222
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:24,230
you could give people scholarships.
You could do all this amazing stuff with

1223
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:27,380
that money that you wouldn't be able to 
do if somebody put a cap and said,

1224
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:28,610
you can only make 500 million bucks,

1225
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,600
but here's the way I see money,
right?

1226
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,480
Money is something we've created.
Money is,

1227
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,500
is a man made creation.
This idea of money is to attach value to

1228
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:38,700
things.
That's what money is.

1229
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:42,870
So the game isn't making money.
Money's like an award.

1230
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:45,210
So it's like if a movie director was 
like,

1231
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:47,070
yes,
I make movies to win Oscars,

1232
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,010
that's not what the game is.
It should be to make a great film,

1233
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,410
right?
You should be to live a good life and we

1234
00:51:52,411 --> 00:51:53,244
reward you along the way because if you 
do things that are of value to a 

1235
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:56,880
society,
we pay you,

1236
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,763
right?
You know?

1237
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,540
But the game is,
the game is basketball.

1238
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:01,620
The game is football.
The game,

1239
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:04,770
his movies to game is podcasting or 
truth telling.

1240
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,633
It's not making money.
And that's where I think human beings 

1241
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:12,930
and society have lost their way because 
now it's just about winning the award.

1242
00:52:12,931 --> 00:52:14,510
It's not about doing the work.
And if,

1243
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,340
where's that money

1244
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,720
go though?
Here's the problem.

1245
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,920
Here's the problem.
I was saying,

1246
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:20,440
if you say Eddie Wong could only make 
$500 million a year,

1247
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,520
but all of a sudden your Bolan and you 
hit that ceiling tank,

1248
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:25,354
tank,
tank,

1249
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,670
you're just slamming up against that 
ceiling and every year and you're like,

1250
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:28,121
you know what,
man,

1251
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:28,954
I would have made $3 billion this year,
but I only made 500 million because 

1252
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:36,040
there's a fucking cap on this bitch.
I could have taken that money.

1253
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,950
I could invest it in communities.
I could've started all these,

1254
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,640
these centers for a young kids and helps
them out.

1255
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,950
People I know and you if,
let's say you had 500 Mil,

1256
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,290
you couldn't make any more.
I bet you'd still do this podcast.

1257
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,690
I bet you'd still be working out.
You'd still be telling jokes.

1258
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,070
I'm still living on a mountain.

1259
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,260
No,
about the government.

1260
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,870
Where's the rest of my fucking money?
And you'd be taping it,

1261
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,430
but what would you do with the rest of 
the money?

1262
00:52:57,431 --> 00:52:58,264
How's it work?
Say like save you made $3 billion one 

1263
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:03,580
year,
but the cap was at 500 million,

1264
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,090
so they just cut you off and all the 
rest of that money goes where.

1265
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,470
Yeah,
you just,

1266
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,910
your idea sucks.
Come on.

1267
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:13,180
No fucking idea.
I have a few.

1268
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,203
I have a few government.
It wouldn't be the rubber for wealth 

1269
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,030
now.
I think that you have to then find a way

1270
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,890
to distribute it through nonprofits and 
things like that.

1271
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,530
Right.
Cross,

1272
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,910
we're like 80% of the money goes to 
bullshit.

1273
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,140
Yeah.
It doesn't even go to the actual,

1274
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,270
we would have to build a better 
infrastructure.

1275
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,343
We would have to build a better 
infrastructure for social services and 

1276
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:38,400
public interests and things like that 
because yes,

1277
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,443
the nonprofit sector,
a lot of the times it's super 

1278
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:45,360
ineffective at remedying the issues that
everybody's giving them money for.

1279
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,683
Problem is that there's so much money 
involved in red tape and bullshit and 

1280
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:54,430
employees and overhead and all the 
different operating costs.

1281
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,383
When you look at the actual operating 
cost involved in charities and you 

1282
00:53:58,511 --> 00:53:59,344
compare it to how much money actually 
goes to the charity that you're sending 

1283
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,640
money to.
It's disturbing and it makes people feel

1284
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:04,180
sad.

1285
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,013
Well,
I'll tell you this like I just think 

1286
00:54:06,351 --> 00:54:07,184
that we have to reconfigure our,
our values and how we value things and 

1287
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:15,790
like we're stuck on this money thing 
like the human species is.

1288
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,420
So we're stuck on money.

1289
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,060
Well I think we're stuck on money 
because a lot of people don't have it.

1290
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,090
So it's the ultimate thing.
Some people have too much of it.

1291
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,520
Some people do.
Like when you don't have money,

1292
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,740
like when I was young and I didn't have 
any money,

1293
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:30,020
man,
I remember the first check that I got,

1294
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,913
I got a big check from Disney.
I've got a development deal when I was 

1295
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:37,640
like 24 and all of a sudden I didn't 
have to worry about my bills.

1296
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,533
It was the first time in my life I 
didn't have to worry about my bills and 

1297
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:42,260
I was like,
my rent is taken care of this month.

1298
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,243
I can go out to eat.
And I remember it was like a physical 

1299
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:49,730
feeling of like,
like a physical feeling of relaxation.

1300
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,833
Like now all of a sudden the,
the overhead cloud of debt and worry 

1301
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:59,660
about my bills had lifted and the sun 
was shining and I was like,

1302
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:03,020
oh,
and I will never forget that feeling.

1303
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,973
So does that feeling was a revelation as
far as like how much stress I was under 

1304
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,950
and most people are under on a daily 
basis.

1305
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,830
So because of that stress,
what people think about is,

1306
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:13,664
man,
I got to make money because that is the 

1307
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:16,880
way to get away from this fucking 
stress.

1308
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,493
Yes.
Because it becomes this carrot that if 

1309
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,140
we ever get to eat,

1310
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,980
yeah,
money angling carry,

1311
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,300
you know,
money gives you freedom.

1312
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,790
And my brother emory's idea with the 
salary cap things,

1313
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,140
he's a bit of a futurist.
He's like,

1314
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:29,850
Yo,
I read a lot of these things.

1315
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:33,060
Robots can do a lot of our agriculture 
in the future.

1316
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,193
We can have a lot of our processes that 
require human beings to clock in and 

1317
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:41,190
clock out and punch buttons to like go 
to robots in the future.

1318
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,791
Oh,
I see.

1319
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,860
What you're trying to do.
You're trying to get rid of the American

1320
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:45,150
farmer.
Okay,

1321
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,160
so he says this,
he says this,

1322
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,900
right?
And he was like,

1323
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,700
some people want to play the game.
Eddie,

1324
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:52,120
he's like you,
you wake up everyday,

1325
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,700
you want to write,
you want to go do something,

1326
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:54,690
you want to be productive.
He's like,

1327
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:56,670
some people,
they just want to live.

1328
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,730
And so after the salary cap,
after 500 million,

1329
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,893
what of that money from those 
billionaires and one percenters goes 

1330
00:56:03,721 --> 00:56:04,980
into,
uh,

1331
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,830
guaranteeing a baseline amount of 
wealth.

1332
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:08,664
Maybe it's $30,000,
and it goes to American people who are 

1333
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:12,390
not making that much money.
And it's like,

1334
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,640
here's 30,000.
Here's your bills taken care of.

1335
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,190
Here's an apartment.
Now you have no excuse.

1336
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,070
You have no excuse.
Go do something you care about.

1337
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:23,100
Go do something you love,
contribute back to society because this,

1338
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,280
the disguise making

1339
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,880
is going to guarantee you baseline 
amount of living if you really do,

1340
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,733
like,
if you really do like reading youtube 

1341
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,354
comments,
read the comments on how retarded that 

1342
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,980
ideas,
because people are fucking lazy and they

1343
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:38,440
don't give people guaranteed money.
They're not going to do shit.

1344
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,423
They're gonna Jack off into the street.
They're going to take shits on the cars 

1345
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:43,930
as they pass by.
They're going to do whatever.

1346
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,500
They're lazy.
They're doing it anyway.

1347
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,540
But you remove the incentive to work.
Like if you give people your,

1348
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:55,930
you're going to create a welfare world.
But if you have robots,

1349
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,793
right?
If you have robots doing this stuff 

1350
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:58,714
right,
this is my brother's thing and I'll 

1351
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,150
fight for his or idea.
If you have,

1352
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,800
if you have robots that can do 
agriculture,

1353
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,960
and it's true,
there's machines everywhere.

1354
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:06,790
They're doing things that humans used to
do.

1355
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:07,923
In the future,
we will have machines that can do a lot 

1356
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,650
of the processes that humans do,
and it's like,

1357
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:13,990
why continue to penalize people who just
aren't,

1358
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:17,290
they don't have the drive and they don't
want to do things analyzing them.

1359
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,153
They have to pull their own weight.
Like the whole reason why there's an 

1360
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,770
incentive to work.
Yeah.

1361
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:26,560
It's because if you work you a thing and
you don't just survive,

1362
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,650
you earn something and you get to 
understand that effort.

1363
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,023
Kidney reward.
Now people don't have effort equals 

1364
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:35,560
reward.
The government just gives you a reward.

1365
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,543
Then it becomes,
how come I only took 30,000 I could 

1366
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:43,981
barely get born on 30,000 when Bill 
[inaudible] Camaro.

1367
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,850
But then you're looking at the worst of 
the worst.

1368
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,713
You'll,
there's a lot of people know that 

1369
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:51,911
nature,
man.

1370
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,744
If you take people from scratch and give
and make them entitled from scratch and 

1371
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:00,280
just have them programmed to think that 
money comes free and it's coming off,

1372
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:02,350
and then you have a nation of spoiled 
kids,

1373
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,740
you ever seen a spoiled rich parents?
I,

1374
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,980
they want you to spoil all.
Let me ask you this.

1375
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,170
Motivational.
Do you think you can change people?

1376
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,300
You definitely could change them.
If you give him $30,000 a year,

1377
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:15,250
you can make them lazy.
You can.

1378
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,890
You make people lazy and they didn't 
earn that money,

1379
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:20,320
then you can't just give people money 
for no reason.

1380
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,860
That and help people contributes.
It doesn't make a better society.

1381
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:26,470
I just wanted to make your baseline 
people shelter,

1382
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,550
clothing,
food,

1383
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,100
health services.
I just want to thin the herd.

1384
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,960
Okay?
I want wolves in the streets.

1385
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,910
I want to make it harder.
I want end to that.

1386
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,833
I want people to get into that.
To live in the woods for a month out of 

1387
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:38,780
the year.
Yeah.

1388
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,840
I've just worked with some people where 
men,

1389
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:44,560
there's these people who work super hard
and we can't pay them enough.

1390
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,630
It's not in the budget.
There's not the opportunity,

1391
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,980
and I'm like,
man,

1392
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:49,330
I wish I could do more for this guy.

1393
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,380
Then there's Pete.
What do you mean?

1394
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:51,214
Like what people,
this is a very utopic guys that work on 

1395
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:54,664
the show would make.
There's guys and girls that work on the 

1396
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:57,970
show.
APS thinks like that and I'm like,

1397
00:58:57,971 --> 00:58:58,804
man,
you know what?

1398
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,420
I wish we could pay him more because I 
think you're doing great work,

1399
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:05,110
but the economics of this project and 
this show,

1400
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,273
this is what it is.
Then I have people who've I've worked 

1401
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,960
with on other shows where they just 
don't show up.

1402
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,910
They don't show up.
They don't work hard.

1403
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,530
They're just clocking in,
clocking out,

1404
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,660
and they don't care.
Right,

1405
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,990
but then I was like,
that never change that dial.

1406
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,780
Never.
I will never change that guy.

1407
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:20,643
They might,
but they would have to have sort of a 

1408
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:22,160
life affirming

1409
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,993
experience.
Like something would have to happen in 

1410
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,240
near death experience.
I'll losing a loved one,

1411
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,580
a revelation,
a psychedelic drug experience,

1412
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:30,650
but some of his fights,
my biggest,

1413
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,240
my biggest failures in life,
Joe,

1414
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,133
is me trying to inspire or give 
motivation to someone who just does not 

1415
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,460
care.
Yeah,

1416
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:38,294
you can't do that.
And that's,

1417
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,133
if you give people $30,000 a year,
that's what you're gonna get to be a 

1418
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,833
problem.
People need insulin check off somewhere 

1419
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:47,510
bad.
They need an incentive.

1420
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:49,820
They need,
they need something to get them to work.

1421
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:50,654
And then in doing that,
you create people that understand and 

1422
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:57,200
value hard work and discipline.
And it's not just about making money.

1423
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,183
It's also about understanding yourself 
and knowing that you can accomplish 

1424
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:03,080
things and not just accomplish things 
from a financial standpoint,

1425
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,033
but accomplish things as far as like 
going on a diet and taking care of your 

1426
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:08,240
health,
pursuing an athletic goal,

1427
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,530
pursuing a creative goal of like 
finishing a book or writing a manuscript

1428
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:13,010
or,
well,

1429
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:13,843
there's,
there's a lot of things that people 

1430
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,090
won't do if you just give them money.

1431
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,260
I agree.
I've,

1432
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:22,590
I've met a lot of crappy entitled people
who they,

1433
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,190
they don't give an effort because they 
don't have to.

1434
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:28,340
There are a lot of those people,
but then I meet a lot of people who they

1435
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,920
just don't have their baseline needs and
there's a part of me that's like,

1436
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:31,754
man,
I wish I could guarantee baseline needs 

1437
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:35,930
for these people because even if they 
wanted to work,

1438
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:37,460
there isn't an opportunity for them.
Right,

1439
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:40,430
but your baseline needs all right.
In this country,

1440
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,703
if w if you look at like the amount of 
people in this country that have 

1441
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,274
baseline need issues and how much money 
they earn as opposed to the rest of the 

1442
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:50,054
world.
You know,

1443
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,130
this is a crazy statistic that I've 
quoted before.

1444
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:56,120
If you make more than $34,000 a year,
you are in the 1% of the world,

1445
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,670
the world,
the planet earth.

1446
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,760
But living in America,
you make $30,000 there's some people,

1447
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,594
men like they can't even pay parking 
tickets and they ended up in jail and 

1448
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,490
they have jobs and they work and it's 
fucking hard.

1449
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,520
Parking tickets get you in jail.
Really get there's,

1450
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,830
there's a few cases,
not,

1451
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,693
not a few.
There's tons of cases where you don't 

1452
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:16,244
pay your parking tickets.
They pull you over again late parking 

1453
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:20,660
tickets.
They'll end up putting you in jail.

1454
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,330
Like there was a case,
I think it was in,

1455
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,940
I think there was a couple of cases in 
Ferguson,

1456
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:28,520
Missouri that people were talking about 
last year with,

1457
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,443
with a woman,
a couple of people who did not have the 

1458
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:33,224
money to pay their parking tickets or 
traffic violations and that over time 

1459
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,280
you can't pay,
you end up in jail.

1460
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,440
Well,
it's a cycle that's kind of crazy.

1461
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,960
And then this is definitely not have to 
look at Jamie,

1462
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:43,010
let's not.

1463
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:43,843
But if it can definitely,
I mean definitely do better than put 

1464
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:49,940
people in jail for not I parking tickets
are fucking ridiculous.

1465
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:50,774
First of all.
I mean if there's a violation as far as 

1466
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:55,850
like some on parking in front of a fire 
hydrant or something like that,

1467
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:58,460
that makes sense to me.
Or parking in front of a driveway,

1468
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,980
like that kind of shit.
But the idea of charging,

1469
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:02,930
hey,
but the idea that you're charging people

1470
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:03,764
to park on the street,
it's fucking gross anyway that you have 

1471
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:09,290
a meter and I have to put money in his 
meter so I could park my car.

1472
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,480
I bought,
fuck you.

1473
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:11,510
You know,
these are p,

1474
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,550
these are streets that were paying for 
with our taxes.

1475
01:02:13,551 --> 01:02:15,950
By the way,
this is a public street.

1476
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,023
And the idea that you're going to just 
steal money from people because they 

1477
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,100
have to park somewhere.

1478
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,180
Yeah,
it's gross.

1479
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,014
And not only that,
you have this fucking asshole and a bus 

1480
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,730
or there's little scooter thing that 
goes around and gives tickets.

1481
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,210
Then march your tire would chalk to make
sure that you're,

1482
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:31,044
you know,
you've,

1483
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,530
you've not been parking there for 
northern 90 minutes.

1484
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:37,170
I'll give you a ticket for that too.
It's all gross man.

1485
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,160
Oh that shit's gross.

1486
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,750
Either way.
Next time I come on India,

1487
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,900
have more fully fleshed out salary cap 
idea.

1488
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,390
But I'm telling you like,
I've been thinking about this thing that

1489
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,650
do it.
I mean there's,

1490
01:02:47,651 --> 01:02:49,630
there's gotta be ways that are better 
than that.

1491
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,540
And the big way is my feeling if,
I mean,

1492
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,374
I've discussed this before,
but my feeling that this country has a 

1493
01:02:57,551 --> 01:03:00,190
lot of places where you're like 
Baltimore.

1494
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,830
I had Michael Wood on,
on the podcast before.

1495
01:03:02,831 --> 01:03:03,664
He's a former police officer from 
Baltimore who talked about how crazy it 

1496
01:03:07,361 --> 01:03:09,790
is there and how they would find when he
was a cop.

1497
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,653
They found this manifest from like the 
1970s it was a directive of like a how 

1498
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:16,084
to engage in different areas and where 
the crime is and where the drug 

1499
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:21,400
violences and where the breaking room 
and he's like,

1500
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,593
this was the same shit that we were 
dealing with in the two thousands he's 

1501
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:29,650
like,
is this same areas the same problems?

1502
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,490
The same exact like this is where the 
drugs are,

1503
01:03:33,491 --> 01:03:34,690
this is what the crime is.

1504
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,130
It was the same thing.
He's like,

1505
01:03:36,131 --> 01:03:39,870
no one fixed it and when you're stuck in
that kind of a cycle,

1506
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,100
that is where the government should be 
sending money.

1507
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:42,934
Where's always setting money?
These countries sending money to 

1508
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,950
Afghanistan and Iraq and trying to 
rebuild nations.

1509
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,750
How about rebuild this fucking nation?
Yeah.

1510
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:53,170
How about these problems that we have?
If we want this country to be stronger,

1511
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,140
the best way to make a stronger country 
is to have less losers.

1512
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,180
All right.
Now when you get a shitty hand,

1513
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,610
if you have two ones,
but you have four aces,

1514
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,010
what the fuck man come one.
Well,

1515
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:03,903
we had to figure out a way.
We have to figure out a way to make the 

1516
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:10,900
hands that people are dealt with in life
far easier to move with.

1517
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,763
Yes.
And there's a lot of people that are 

1518
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:13,204
dealt with a fucking terrible shitty 
hand and we just turn a blind eye 

1519
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:20,080
towards these terrible impoverished 
communities that are fucking filled with

1520
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:22,660
crime.
And these children that grow up there,

1521
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,613
by the time they get to be 17 and 18 
they've seen so much shit and the 

1522
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:27,034
program programming in their mind is so,
so disturbing because everything that 

1523
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:34,230
they've been involved with,
everything they've seen,

1524
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,220
they've seen loved ones getting 
carceration.

1525
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:38,620
They seen people get shot,
they've seen crime,

1526
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:41,710
they've seen a lack of hope.
They've seen police brutality,

1527
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,100
they seen all these terrible things.
That is what we need to clean up in this

1528
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:45,934
country.
Not Ski people from making tons of 

1529
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:48,350
money.
Well,

1530
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,340
the thing is,
all right,

1531
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,203
if I take the salary cap thing of when,
my idea is this though is I want to 

1532
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:56,330
guarantee a baseline of living for 
people in America.

1533
01:04:56,331 --> 01:04:58,700
So it's like there,
but they have to work for that.

1534
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:01,580
So you don't even know what you,
if someone doesn't let us,

1535
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:03,130
somebody just wants to sit there.
Food,

1536
01:05:03,131 --> 01:05:05,480
mood Joe.
I know a lot of people that want to work

1537
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:07,730
and they can't get jobs.
Well that's a different story.

1538
01:05:07,731 --> 01:05:08,564
Also,
if you're born in some of those 

1539
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,540
communities,
the key word you said is hope.

1540
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,593
A lot of kids don't have hope.
I remember a kid that I used to hustle 

1541
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:16,280
with.
This is a good guy.

1542
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,823
Yeah.
We,

1543
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,440
we,
we sold shit outside the cake shop,

1544
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,460
whatever,
right.

1545
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,900
Weed.
I was selling weed,

1546
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,400
whatever.
It's not a big deal.

1547
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,450
Whatever.
Weed,

1548
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:26,920
Xanax,
sound silly things.

1549
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,480
All right.
And then,

1550
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,314
uh,
he also was like a a night manager at 

1551
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:33,630
target.
Right?

1552
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:35,890
And he's a night manager at target.
It's kind of wasting away.

1553
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:39,310
He was like 1920 years old.
Incredible basketball player.

1554
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,144
One of the best a IU basketball players.
I've seen and he got offers to play at 

1555
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,004
some jucos and things like that.
And I remember one day we went up to 

1556
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:50,910
Harlem to get the work and I was coming 
back down on the train.

1557
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,753
I was like,
Fam,

1558
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,340
you should sign up.
You should go to that Juco.

1559
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,980
You should enroll.
Like right now it's July,

1560
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:57,933
there's still time you enroll now.
You could be in there for the fall 

1561
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,520
semester and you could play ball.
You're 19 years old to this man.

1562
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,850
And I remember we just passed the stop 
and he's like,

1563
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:08,440
Nah man,
it'll never happen.

1564
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:09,274
I'm like,
why?

1565
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,350
And he's like,
you don't get it Eddie.

1566
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:16,030
Like the way you are your parents,
like Dave taught you,

1567
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:18,340
you have a chance.
I don't have a chance.

1568
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,840
He's like,
I've been told my whole life,

1569
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,370
I don't have a chance.
You know,

1570
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:24,400
I live with my grandmother and whether 
he's right or not,

1571
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:26,290
I disagree with him.
He does have a chance.

1572
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:29,470
But he had psychologically been broken,
had no hope,

1573
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:31,060
and did not believe he could do 
anything.

1574
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:31,894
And when I saw that,
it fundamentally changed me because it 

1575
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:34,900
was like,
Ma,

1576
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,540
I'm privileged.
I'm privileged because my parents,

1577
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,390
maybe they beat the crap Outta me.
Maybe they were hard on me,

1578
01:06:40,391 --> 01:06:41,224
but I never,
I never didn't feel like I had a chance 

1579
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:45,340
if I worked hard.
Right.

1580
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,383
There's a lot of people in this world 
that just for 20 years they've lived in 

1581
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:50,770
America and they like,
even if I worked hard,

1582
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,760
even I see my parents working hard.
We just never got the opportunity.

1583
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,643
Right.

1584
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,373
There's thousands and thousands and 
thousands of stories of people who grew 

1585
01:06:58,841 --> 01:06:59,674
up in similar environments that didn't 
have that mindset that even though they 

1586
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:03,340
were told they didn't have any hope,
they said,

1587
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,480
I'll show you,
and they went out and they made,

1588
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,810
made their shit happen and they became 
rich and successful.

1589
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:09,370
Yeah.
That guy could have been that.

1590
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:13,450
He chose to feel sorry for himself.
You were telling him some good things.

1591
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:14,284
You were giving him some good advice.
He didn't want to listen and he didn't 

1592
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:17,284
want to listen.
And he was telling you is consciously 

1593
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:21,550
aware that he had been programmed to 
think there was no hope,

1594
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,710
if that's what he was telling you,
that's on him,

1595
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:25,150
man.
And there's always going to be that.

1596
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:25,984
And that is an example for you because 
the people that fail on this weird 

1597
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:33,610
fucking race that we're all in or this 
weird experience that were on when they,

1598
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:35,830
when they fail,
if you can't help them,

1599
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:37,300
at least you can learn from them.

1600
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,433
You know?
And we can look along the way a 

1601
01:07:39,381 --> 01:07:42,040
different people that have done terrible
things and we could say,

1602
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:42,874
well,
what they did was awful and they should 

1603
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:46,060
be punished.
And that is almost definitely true.

1604
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,103
But also we can learn that this could 
happen to anybody who's in the wrong 

1605
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:51,664
circumstances,
had the wrong mindset and chooses the 

1606
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:54,850
wrong actions.
These,

1607
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,800
all these things are important.
These are,

1608
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:57,634
these are important,
not just for the person that's involved 

1609
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:00,694
in that situation,
but for everyone else observing because 

1610
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:05,740
we learn from each other.
We don't just learn by experience.

1611
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:08,140
We learn from other people's experiences
and it's very,

1612
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:12,480
very important that way because we can 
experience other people's lives just to,

1613
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,503
through sheer communication as one of 
the most beautiful things about social 

1614
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:16,814
media is that we can all share much more
information than has ever been possible 

1615
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,300
before.
And through that you can learn,

1616
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,640
hey,
you know who else was told that he would

1617
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:27,620
never amount to be shit?
Jay Z,

1618
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,753
you know,
you know who else grew up in a shitty 

1619
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:30,464
neighborhood,
you know this fucking basketball player 

1620
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:36,260
or that MMA fighter or this standup 
comedian or that artist.

1621
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:39,430
There's a million examples of people who
will turn,

1622
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,270
we'll told they're not going to be shit.

1623
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,373
Yeah,
but you are an exceptional dude in some 

1624
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:45,260
of the guys you mentioned,
they're exceptional dudes.

1625
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:47,480
Might I?
I agree with every word you said.

1626
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:48,314
You are saying everything my parents 
ever said to me and I listened and I 

1627
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:53,540
fucking did the war.
My parents told me get a job.

1628
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,330
That's what my parents did.
They told me I wasn't funny.

1629
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,360
They told me fighting is dangerous.
They told me all the wrong things.

1630
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:01,610
Yeah.
My mom's still told the way a few months

1631
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:03,230
ago that I should still open a law firm.
She's like,

1632
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:04,400
yeah,
what's you're doing is funny.

1633
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:05,300
It's cool.
It's okay,

1634
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:07,390
but you should do something solid that 
you can count on it.

1635
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,030
That's hilarious.
My mom still does not separate voyeurs.

1636
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,480
They die of being tired and just 
unhappy,

1637
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:15,983
misery,
exhausted and they just get coke and 

1638
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:20,360
hookers and shoot themselves.
Can I go to the bathroom?

1639
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,700
Go to the bathroom.
It's a good time.

1640
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:25,340
Just something has hit the Internet that
I don't know.

1641
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,310
You need to show you.
I guess it may or may not be legit,

1642
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:32,870
but then decided to retire young thanks 
to the cheese catches later.

1643
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:35,480
Conor mcgregor and he's trolling you 
think so.

1644
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,373
Fuck yeah.
There's a lot of people have been 

1645
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,270
hitting me up telling me to show you and
yeah,

1646
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:43,190
no one knows what's going on.
I decided to retire young,

1647
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:46,890
which means like 34 eventually,
not today.

1648
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,353
[inaudible] man.
Unless he got fucking head kick today 

1649
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,753
and knocked into oblivion.
The idea that he's going to go out on a 

1650
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:58,540
loss like that to nate Diaz Hook.
He's got plenty of cash.

1651
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,680
If he wanted to retire young and step 
away,

1652
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:04,143
I mean I guarantee you he probably made 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 

1653
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:09,993
million bucks with Josie Aldo fight.
He probably made more than that for the 

1654
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,200
Nate Diaz fight.
I would,

1655
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,660
I would imagine after he spent a fuck 
load of Ed,

1656
01:10:16,661 --> 01:10:18,670
he's probably still got a few million 
bucks laying around.

1657
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,880
He's a hero in Ireland.
He could always make money.

1658
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:25,780
You can always run a gym and be fine,
but if I had to guess,

1659
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,620
it doesn't make any sense.
The only reason why it would make sense,

1660
01:10:29,621 --> 01:10:30,454
the only reason why it would make sense 
as connor had actually thought about 

1661
01:10:33,551 --> 01:10:36,610
retiring from mma before he got the call
for the UFC.

1662
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,020
There was a point in time where he had 
some friends that were experiencing some

1663
01:10:41,021 --> 01:10:41,854
serious health issues from fighting and 
then most recently that young man from 

1664
01:10:47,531 --> 01:10:50,290
the Portuguese guy died in an mma 
contest,

1665
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:53,260
which I think took place in the UK,
wasn't

1666
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:54,763
I know what he involved or related in 
some way to one of those guys that just 

1667
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:59,290
died too.
Didn't he know him or train with?

1668
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:00,423
I think he trained with the,
the Portuguese guy that just died 

1669
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:05,080
recently.
It is entirely possible in that sense,

1670
01:11:05,081 --> 01:11:08,350
but if I had to guess,
there's no way he'd do it like this.

1671
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:09,030
Yeah.

1672
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,863
It also,
I was talking with someone as this was 

1673
01:11:11,381 --> 01:11:12,330
going on,
might not,

1674
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,040
doesn't even seem like he usually talks 
on

1675
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,740
twitter sorta like I might,
he could have gotten hacked maybe,

1676
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,813
but we don't,
no one really knows what's going on 

1677
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:19,770
right now.
That's it.

1678
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,920
That's if you've got hacked and that's 
it.

1679
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:24,210
That's all they're gonna do.
Yeah.

1680
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:26,820
No,
I mean it hasn't been deleted yet and no

1681
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:30,420
one else has really commented on it.
I would call bullshit,

1682
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,380
but you never know.
I just highly doubted.

1683
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,750
Stay tuned folks.
I think he's trolling.

1684
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,033
If I had to guess,
I'd say he's trolling fucking around 

1685
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,790
people.
If he decided I'm going to retire young.

1686
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,250
And then like I said,
like one day or two days later,

1687
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:47,610
which means around 34 you know,
and he's like 28 now.

1688
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:48,931
I mean,
he's smart.

1689
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:49,764
He will retire young.
It's just there's some dudes stay in it 

1690
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:55,260
way too long.
They wind up with rattled domes.

1691
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,260
She got to get out.
I feel,

1692
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,160
I feel slim from this.

1693
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,050
Cogenic is already.
Do you feel better?

1694
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,730
It felt good.
Checked out,

1695
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,470
checked out the keg in the bathroom was 
good.

1696
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,230
It's like a pony keg now what do you 
try?

1697
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,470
Do you have a target weight you're 
trying to get to or a body fat number?

1698
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,370
Yeah,
I want it.

1699
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:16,370
I want to get to like 15 16% body fat 22
right now.

1700
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,240
2123 so you don't have lofty goals.
You have reasonable goals.

1701
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,133
Reasonable goals.
I'm not trying to be like shredded and 

1702
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:24,270
shit.
Why not?

1703
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:27,600
I don't know.
I kind of liked being a dancing bear.

1704
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:32,070
Do you like it or is it like your 19 
year old friend that was like,

1705
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,290
you don't understand.
There's no hope for me now.

1706
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:35,910
I can never get shredded.
I just need,

1707
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:37,860
I just need to be a little bit better at
basketball.

1708
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:38,870
That's it.
That's it.

1709
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,810
That's don't want to be shredded.

1710
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,550
Like if somebody gives you a pill,
say Eddie,

1711
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:44,610
I have a pill right now with no health 
consequences whatsoever.

1712
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:49,140
I can give you this pill and you will be
fucking Lebron James Shredded.

1713
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,003
No,
I think part of my identity is being 

1714
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:52,104
slightly chubby.
Part of your identity has become more 

1715
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:55,740
chubby.
Like I'm beyond,

1716
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,810
I'm prediabetic so I need to just watch 
it.

1717
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,170
Sometimes it's some years or something.
Six months ago to Dr I'm prediabetic and

1718
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,300
another time for now you're pre diabetic
and you're still eating candy at night.

1719
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,930
18 months ago I went to the doctor and 
they were like,

1720
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,240
you're in the prediabetic zone.
Then I got out of it,

1721
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:13,074
which was good but it's like I have to 
watch it cause I'm kind of on the line 

1722
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,250
and yet you're still eating candy late 
at night.

1723
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,540
The fuck is wrong with you.
Kind of.

1724
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:19,560
No self control man.

1725
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:20,663
But then you,
you're thinking everybody should get 30 

1726
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,374
grand.
Do you understand like discipline is an 

1727
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:25,740
important part of life?
Do you understand this?

1728
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,990
This is very important.
Young Jed.

1729
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:30,480
I am young Jeddah,
I got to get to like full jet.

1730
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:31,500
I status,
man.

1731
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:32,930
I got to work on it.
Just got to,

1732
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,863
do you write things down?
Do you write things down that you have 

1733
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,060
to do?
Yeah.

1734
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,690
Do you write things down that you just 
don't do anymore like this?

1735
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:41,250
I won't do this anymore.
This is not,

1736
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:42,840
I'm not,
this is not on the menu anymore.

1737
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,150
To do that and then sometimes I still 
fucking do them.

1738
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,170
Well,
you can't do that.

1739
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,343
I get to write things down.
That's against the point of writing it 

1740
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,190
down.
But yeah,

1741
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,960
just getting to give yourself a certain 
amount.

1742
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:53,430
Like here,
here's a good example.

1743
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:55,050
Give yourself 60 days.

1744
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:59,160
Say for 60 days I'm going to go on a 
diet where I don't eat any bread.

1745
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,980
I don't take in any pasta.
I don't have any rice.

1746
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,150
I only eat healthy foods.
Everything is healthy or I don't eat it.

1747
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,920
It's it.
The rice just to kill her man.

1748
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,870
Well,
rice is a lot of carbs,

1749
01:14:09,871 --> 01:14:10,704
you know,
and it's it directly in your body to 

1750
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:15,460
sugar and it'll also,
it's like it's inflammatory,

1751
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:18,400
like it causes inflammation.
Whole 30 thing.

1752
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:21,960
Somebody told me about the whole exam.
It's like no processed foods,

1753
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,560
no dairy,
no alcohol.

1754
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:26,710
Whole 30 for what?
Why whole 30 for 30 days?

1755
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,800
30 days and you eat like whole foods and
shit?

1756
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,870
Well,
I just eat whole foods always now,

1757
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,153
but I've been doing it for I t I got on 
his primal blueprint diet about three 

1758
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,880
months ago and I said I was going to 
give myself two months,

1759
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,560
but after the two months we're over.

1760
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,500
I'm like,
this is amit now this,

1761
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:44,950
I feel so good.
Do you drink?

1762
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,813
You don't.
Okay.

1763
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,520
I don't get crazy.
But occasionally I do.

1764
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:51,550
I believe everything in moderation,
including moderation.

1765
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:52,983
So if you're,
if you're out and you get your freak on 

1766
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,350
and someone says you want to do shots,
you're like,

1767
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:57,790
fuck yeah,
let's do this.

1768
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,740
Get in there.
But you don't do it all the time.

1769
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,010
Every now and then.
But I understand the consequences.

1770
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,020
You will get wrecked,
you know?

1771
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:08,260
But also Chow Maine on a curb like three
weeks ago,

1772
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:09,700
that wasn't,
that wasn't awesome.

1773
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,040
Let's do it.
Drinking,

1774
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,590
drinking,
well,

1775
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,740
booze is bad,
but the feeling is great.

1776
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:15,753
I think there's some amazing things that
are accomplished when you're under the 

1777
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:20,760
influence and incredible things get 
accomplished.

1778
01:15:20,761 --> 01:15:24,430
I puked shall remain on a curb,
but as far as like social things,

1779
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:27,400
you have real great fun with your 
friends that you'll never forget.

1780
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,580
There's there's moments of like,
ah,

1781
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,433
there's,
there's,

1782
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,463
there's moments during alcohol 
intoxication where you kind of see 

1783
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:42,460
things from what they are cause the,
the veil that's in front of your mind,

1784
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:43,563
the veil of inhibition and struggle and 
bullshit and insecurity is removed by 

1785
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:49,900
that.
Alcohol for the most part,

1786
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:50,734
alcohol makes people a lot of,
it makes a lot of people assholes 

1787
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,273
because?
Because they lose their inhibitions 

1788
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:59,320
because they get cocky because they 
don't have fear anymore.

1789
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,030
It just,
it,

1790
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:00,863
it distorts reality.
Do you get more social or antisocial 

1791
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:04,900
when you joined?
More social.

1792
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,500
Yeah,
me too.

1793
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,090
I get more social.
You're a nice guy,

1794
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,480
nice people to become more nice.
But when someone's an asshole,

1795
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:12,880
when they're drunk,
I usually find it's incredibly revealing

1796
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:15,310
of who they're trying not to be when 
they're sober.

1797
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,313
Like what they're hiding from you when 
they're sober and usually is like 

1798
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,890
revealing of the demons inside of them.

1799
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,840
I just get goofy or,
yeah,

1800
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:23,730
I get silly.
I get,

1801
01:16:23,731 --> 01:16:25,070
I want to hug people and shit.
Know what?

1802
01:16:25,071 --> 01:16:27,280
I laugh.
I'm a silly,

1803
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:28,570
goofy motherfucker,
so that's,

1804
01:16:28,571 --> 01:16:29,331
that's what happened.
Well,

1805
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:30,164
I've,
I've had friends that are alcoholics 

1806
01:16:30,931 --> 01:16:33,130
though and it's,
it's a weird thing when you look and you

1807
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,470
see those shark eyes were like,
oh,

1808
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,180
Eddie is not there anymore.
Clink.

1809
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,990
You know when you mean to use your name,
but you know,

1810
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,860
or Mike's not there anymore.
You know,

1811
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:43,120
you look right in their eye and you're 
like,

1812
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:44,400
where'd they go?
They're not agree.

1813
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,460
Drunks too,
man.

1814
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:46,294
You're like,
they're fucking hiding that shit all 

1815
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,510
day.
Yeah,

1816
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,720
man.
Yeah Dude,

1817
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,300
I want a date with this girl.
Went on one day and it was awesome.

1818
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,590
It was great.
Had a good time,

1819
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,401
a lot of fun.
I was like,

1820
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,300
wow.
She's pretty cool.

1821
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,610
Next day I meet her at the bar.

1822
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:00,190
She's already tanked up.
She's breaking glasses,

1823
01:17:00,191 --> 01:17:01,300
yelling at people.
I was like,

1824
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:03,490
what?
What the fuck?

1825
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:06,400
Just just a few drinks.
It's all,

1826
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:08,980
it took a few drinks and she went loco.
Did you,

1827
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,363
I know I ran mass mass.
Sounds like she could have been 

1828
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:14,000
incredible,
bro.

1829
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,890
Just break a records of the bedroom.
I knew some people that had been in some

1830
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:21,440
trouble and I learned from other 
people's experiences.

1831
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,270
No,
I've never been a fan of drunks,

1832
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,940
especially girls.
I just feel like when you,

1833
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,740
if you,
if you're a date with someone,

1834
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,870
if you dated drug addict or you did an 
alcoholic or something like that,

1835
01:17:30,871 --> 01:17:31,704
and man,
the burden of just getting to know 

1836
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:34,780
someone,
enjoying their company and,

1837
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,120
and being even with each other and 
enjoying each other's company,

1838
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,400
it's,
it's hard enough to figure out if you're

1839
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:44,900
compatible with someone socially without
this monkey on their back.

1840
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,753
Yeah,
someone's got a heroin problem and 

1841
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,860
you're going to date a girl with a 
heroin problem.

1842
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,780
Like I have a buddy,
my buddy Brian Cowen,

1843
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:53,780
he's the best,
but he always used to try to clean these

1844
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:55,550
girls up.
He's tried to take him in.

1845
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,370
He was the worst.
He was the worst.

1846
01:17:58,371 --> 01:17:59,204
I used to tell him,
I like get out now and he wouldn't do 

1847
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:02,160
it.
And then two years later,

1848
01:18:02,161 --> 01:18:02,631
so was he's,
man,

1849
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:06,760
I should've listened to.
You should have listened to me again her

1850
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:07,623
fucking a decade.
I used to tell this guy dating a heroin 

1851
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:14,270
addict or not dating a heroin addict and
we'll go with the no,

1852
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,533
it's a good move.
Yeah.

1853
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:16,760
But some guys are like,
yeah,

1854
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:19,340
she's just alone and she just needs a 
friend and you know,

1855
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:20,770
once it cleaned up,
I mean she's,

1856
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,910
well I'll make mistakes that are into 
it.

1857
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,100
They're into it.
Well that's also,

1858
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,130
here's the reality of captain save a 
hose.

1859
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,460
When you find someone's problems are 
greater than your own,

1860
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,040
it lets you concentrate on things other 
than your problems,

1861
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:37,760
which you are not fixing the voice.
You are a lazy fuck.

1862
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,043
You know,
so you procrastinate and people find 

1863
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,293
really strange ways to procrastinate and
one of the ways they find it to 

1864
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:44,743
procrastinate is to create other 
problems in their life that take 

1865
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:49,160
precedent over the problem that they're 
avoiding.

1866
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:51,650
I agree.
I agree.

1867
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:53,990
I have given the same speech to all.
This is the funny thing.

1868
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,880
I agree with you on all the personal 
things.

1869
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:58,690
I don't know why my personal views don't
translate to my world views.

1870
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,030
It's kind of funny.
I'm a lot of story thousand bucks.

1871
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:01,873
I'm a lot softer with my worldviews than
I am with like people and my brothers 

1872
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:05,570
and people that work with me.

1873
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,420
I am too.
It's just I believe in a living wage.

1874
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,453
You know,
like I'm down with this Bernie Sanders 

1875
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:11,294
thing and I love the fact that governor 
Cuomo in New York just passed this $15 

1876
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:16,790
an hour thing.
The minimum wage going to be 15 bucks an

1877
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:17,571
hour.
It's so funny.

1878
01:19:17,571 --> 01:19:19,410
There's someone set up my facebook,
you know,

1879
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,860
um,
you think this is good,

1880
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:24,110
this is going to destroy a lot of 
businesses.

1881
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:24,710
I'm like,
yeah,

1882
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:27,290
you know what they said that about 
slavery.

1883
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,090
It's the same shit they said about 
slavery,

1884
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:31,400
abolished slavery.
These plantations is going to go under.

1885
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:32,540
Well,
guess what?

1886
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:33,374
You can't,
you can't just have people work all day 

1887
01:19:35,511 --> 01:19:37,370
for you and not give them any fucking 
money.

1888
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,440
Yeah.
They have to be able to make a living.

1889
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:40,423
And if your business does not make 
enough money to give someone a living 

1890
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:45,980
wage to work all week for you,
then guess what?

1891
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,800
You don't have to fast forward.
You can't afford to have an employee,

1892
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,200
so you have to figure out a way to 
either make more money.

1893
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,153
You have to figure out a way to get a 
better business or operate with less 

1894
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:55,130
employees.
Yeah,

1895
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,123
that's it.
The only thing that they have to do is 

1896
01:19:57,921 --> 01:19:58,754
they have the help subsidize a small 
midsize businesses to compete with like 

1897
01:20:01,371 --> 01:20:03,350
the walmarts and the best buys and the 
target.

1898
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:04,184
Subsidize how tax incentives and things 
like that to the small midsize 

1899
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,520
businesses because to absorb this new 
salaries right now,

1900
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:15,450
immediately the big companies have a lot
more of a cushion in a margin to absorb,

1901
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:17,150
absorb this shit.
What I'm saying,

1902
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,770
the small mid,
you have to start adjusting your,

1903
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,400
the way you do in business,
the prices,

1904
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,263
things like that.
You got to move some pieces around so I 

1905
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:27,710
can fix all this shit.

1906
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,700
How quick.
Legalize weed.

1907
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,040
Yeah.
Legalize weed worldwide.

1908
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,413
Everybody would just so we'd know.
Any people who are having a job right 

1909
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:38,220
now would make a lot of money just 
selling weed.

1910
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,163
They would go to Colorado right now.
You know real estate Colorado's up like 

1911
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:47,230
19% but you know what's going to happen?
Bleed.

1912
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:50,420
It's not going to be like your neighbor 
or the guy downstairs halloween.

1913
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:53,400
It's going to be big companies and then 
it's going to be these kids.

1914
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,660
No,
I'm all for legal.

1915
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:57,000
I wouldn't say I want to leave us.
They already are.

1916
01:20:57,001 --> 01:21:00,630
These people are buying up the rights in
certain states to be the distributors.

1917
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,970
That's what those are.
State laws.

1918
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,940
You can't have those state laws.
Those are buying up the rights laws.

1919
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:07,680
That's what they were trying to pass in 
Ohio,

1920
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,514
right?
Jamie and everybody rightfully said no 

1921
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:12,660
to it because this was going to be a 
monopoly situation.

1922
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,070
They were going to just be,
it's legal.

1923
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:15,030
Go,
go crazy,

1924
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,460
go sell it.
Sell it like a half baked.

1925
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,240
You know what's going on in Colorado is 
it's changing the economy.

1926
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,460
Colorado,
first of all,

1927
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,620
they made more money from taxes this 
year.

1928
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,010
For the first time ever.
Then they did from alcohol with weed,

1929
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,990
more money from weed,
then with alcohol,

1930
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:31,824
which is just fucking bananas.
And they charged 39% the 39% taxes on 

1931
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:37,500
weed.
And everybody's like,

1932
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:39,080
who cares?
Who Cares?

1933
01:21:39,081 --> 01:21:39,914
Salad.
It's still cheaper than alcohol and 

1934
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:43,860
we'll pay it and it's better.
Exactly.

1935
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:47,700
So like something like that could change
and also look,

1936
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:48,534
man,
you can't infantilize this entire 

1937
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:51,564
country like that.
You can't tell people what they can and 

1938
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:54,570
can't do.
You just can't do it.

1939
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:57,440
And it's a gigantic part to it.
Anyway.

1940
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:58,320
Yeah,
I mean all these,

1941
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,213
these restrictions on behavior and what 
you can and can't do or a gigantic part 

1942
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:07,290
of the problem with the fiber of our 
economy and the fiber of our culture.

1943
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,333
We've got all these weird restrictions 
that are in place that are archaic and 

1944
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:13,680
don't make any sense.
And when you accept one thing,

1945
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,514
it doesn't make any sense.
Well then it leaves room for a lot of 

1946
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:20,490
other weird shenanigans like Ted Cruz 
wanting to lock people up for Dildos.

1947
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,850
You know about all that shit.
Oh,

1948
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:22,793
oh,
this dumb motherfuckers really close to 

1949
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,524
being president.
Ted Cruz was trying to pass a law that 

1950
01:22:28,561 --> 01:22:31,380
would put you in jail for having dildos 
pull.

1951
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:32,280
Pull this up,
Jamie,

1952
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,233
because this is just one of the most 
hilarious things about this dumb ass 

1953
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:36,803
that people were trying to force down 
the American public's face because the 

1954
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:41,910
Republican candidates are all at joke 
other than Donald Trump.

1955
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:44,400
No one could get past that guy.
And he's a joke.

1956
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,211
No one,
no one.

1957
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,580
You can get past that guy.
So the Republicans are panicking.

1958
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,200
They don't know what to do.

1959
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,213
So they put this fucking Ted Cruz dummy 
in not knowing there's a million 

1960
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:54,660
different things that are wrong with 
them.

1961
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:57,810
The time Ted Cruz defended a ban on 
Dildos,

1962
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:01,860
his legal team argued that there was no 
right to stimulate one's genitals.

1963
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,813
Scroll up please.
In one chapter of his campaign book a 

1964
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:08,440
time for True Senator Ted Cruz.
Proudly chronicles his days,

1965
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,660
his tests,
Texas Solicitor General,

1966
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:11,763
uh,
posted he health in 2003 to 2008 

1967
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:17,680
bolstering his conservative credit.
The Republican president candidate notes

1968
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:22,030
that during his stint as a state's chief
lawyer in front of the Supreme Court and

1969
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:22,864
federal state appellate courts,
he defended the inclusion of under God 

1970
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:27,004
in the pledge of allegiance.
Blahblahblahblahblah scroll up to the 

1971
01:23:29,111 --> 01:23:32,170
the Dildo case.
Uh,

1972
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,730
battle concerning privacy and free 
speech,

1973
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:34,564
right?
2004 companies that owned Austin stores 

1974
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:36,784
selling texts,
sex toys and a retail distributor of 

1975
01:23:38,861 --> 01:23:39,694
such products challenged Texas law 
outlawing the sale and promotion of 

1976
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:45,730
supposedly obscene devices and will were
put,

1977
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:48,420
put the thing where he wanted to have 
how much it,

1978
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,800
you should go to jail for it cause it 
was like two years.

1979
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,560
Here it is.
Um,

1980
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:54,973
under the law,
a person who violated the statute could 

1981
01:23:57,281 --> 01:24:01,330
go to jail for up to two years for 
selling dildos.

1982
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,343
And this dummy supported that.
This is that this is a women's rights 

1983
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:09,460
issue.
Real women's rights issue for Dildos for

1984
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,590
dudes to be sexist.
I'm saying no,

1985
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:12,663
but I'm saying I hope this is one thing 
that women and men can all come 

1986
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:16,180
together.
Dildos.

1987
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:17,823
So important.
It's the most hilarious thing because 

1988
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,100
Dick's are available for anybody who 
needs them.

1989
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,710
All you have to do is raise your hand,
step outside of your house when you go,

1990
01:24:23,711 --> 01:24:24,544
I'm looking for some deck,
have a sign on the side of the road 

1991
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:28,600
looking for Dick and someone will give 
them,

1992
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:29,500
is going to pull up.
Yeah.

1993
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:30,483
You know,
there's people that stop and like red 

1994
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:34,120
lights and they have signs for change.
Even that works.

1995
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,040
Okay.
People will give you what you need,

1996
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,083
but if you have a sign that says,
I'm looking for Dick and reasonably 

1997
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:42,820
clean,
someone's gotta fuck you.

1998
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,920
Someone had some old pull up.
Yes.

1999
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:45,880
Anytime.
Anywhere,

2000
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:48,400
any corner.
But people have the right,

2001
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,293
the rural right.
They have the right to want a dick 

2002
01:24:51,251 --> 01:24:53,140
without a body attached to it.
Yes.

2003
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:53,770
Yeah.
Uh,

2004
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:57,010
Dick without a relationship or,
or opinions or even a pulse.

2005
01:24:57,011 --> 01:24:57,844
Anything to say.
We want to Dixon Suneemon that off made 

2006
01:24:59,071 --> 01:25:01,420
out of human tissue.
You want a rubber one?

2007
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,913
Yeah.
It's just,

2008
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,400
what's this?
Fill this hole up.

2009
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:06,290
Hard body get done.
It's key.

2010
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:08,680
It's just get it done.
But I don't know how I got to that,

2011
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:09,514
but our leadership as a joke,
it's a joke because you can't expect a 

2012
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:14,734
person to want anybody that wants to run
this entire country has got to be a 

2013
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:18,874
crazy person.

2014
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:19,983
You have to be a nut and it's really,
really shouldn't have one president 

2015
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:23,224
anyway because the idea is ridiculous.
So one person's going to be involved in 

2016
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:28,300
the all the decisions for the entire 
country.

2017
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:32,050
That's preposterous thing too is people 
only pay attention like the presidential

2018
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:33,880
race when all of these other things are 
going on.

2019
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,033
National Senate,
things like it's hard to fucking keep 

2020
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,780
track of though.
They're all fucking clowns.

2021
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,490
It's impossible.
I said it's impossible.

2022
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,353
I don't trust any of them.
And what's really fucked up as this is 

2023
01:25:41,831 --> 01:25:42,664
like the best bot in the planet,
like all the other spots wa all the 

2024
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:49,120
different goofballs all over the world.
Like you see what's going on in Brazil.

2025
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,433
Brazil,
they're impeaching their fucking 

2026
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:52,690
president right now.
The Panama papers,

2027
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:54,310
shit is crazy,
crazy,

2028
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,790
crazy loving it.
Tell it,

2029
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:58,330
tell people about if they don't know 
what it is.

2030
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,240
Well,
the Panama papers is because this is not

2031
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,350
getting discussed in the news hardly at 
all.

2032
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,340
It's some

2033
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,280
not enough,
but it's basically people,

2034
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,090
leaders of of countries like the British
Prime Ministers,

2035
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,700
dad and um,
Brazil,

2036
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,290
the,
the Guy Brazil's involved.

2037
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,380
But there's a people leaders,
presidents,

2038
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,250
prime ministers have been keeping their 
money in offshore accounts,

2039
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:27,020
not paying the taxes that they owe in 
their country and keeping this money off

2040
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:27,854
the books.
And then somebody gave this information 

2041
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:30,944
from a law firm that does most of these 
transactions and it's now being 

2042
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,820
published.
So all the money's being hidden.

2043
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:38,990
Yeah.
An influence.

2044
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:42,430
And it highlights how people are getting
influenced to make certain decisions and

2045
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:46,550
how much briberies taking place and how 
does only apply to certain people.

2046
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:51,740
They don't apply to the people making 
the laws off shit.

2047
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:54,820
It's shit.
So the best way to fix this is what give

2048
01:26:54,821 --> 01:26:55,790
people $30,000.

2049
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,270
Yes.
That's just going to keep people poor.

2050
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,490
That'd be the best way to keep people 
from competing with you.

2051
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:05,840
I'll tell you that.
Give Him,

2052
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:06,703
give him 30 grand.
They're not going to do Jack Shit with 

2053
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,040
chuck rock around kick rocks.
Fucking drink.

2054
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,670
All the people drink oee anymore.
Old English.

2055
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,190
Remember those?
No ketones in them.

2056
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,820
No ketones and old English and that 
stuff will get you fucked up man.

2057
01:27:19,821 --> 01:27:21,680
Yeah,
I remember the first time I drank a 40.

2058
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,560
Uh,
I couldn't believe how drunk you get.

2059
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,570
Yo,
you are you in town this Thursday?

2060
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,700
Yes.
We got a premiere.

2061
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:30,170
You want to come?
Where's it at?

2062
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,520
Wednesdays.
Ace Hotel.

2063
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:32,870
Downtown theater.
What time?

2064
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,130
Uh,

2065
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,270
Eight.
What time is eight o'clock is it?

2066
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,140
Yeah,
it's like seven 38 o'clock.

2067
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,720
Dan Arrow back from the black keys going
to be here at six.

2068
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,370
I was just a dance crib last night.

2069
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,560
He's coming to the premiere.
No.

2070
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,403
How are you guys doing the show?
This motherfucker supposed to be at the 

2071
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:53,690
premiere will be late.
Oh,

2072
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:54,524
Dan Joseph.
Joe Said don't text while you were on 

2073
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:00,800
the show to my bed.
So not good for everybody,

2074
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,290
man.
Therefore we'll talk afterwards.

2075
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:05,040
I'm not sure.
I'm not trying to beg for him.

2076
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:07,350
You know podcasts.
Well,

2077
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,660
you're one of my favorite guests.
Thank you.

2078
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,970
It takes a long time to get from here to
downtown.

2079
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,950
Yeah,
we're in woodland hills.

2080
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:17,951
It'll take you probably an hour and a 
half at six.

2081
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,340
Wow.
Yeah.

2082
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:21,403
He's coming in at six yeah.
If you have to leave your shit at seven 

2083
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,290
you'd have to leave at six so when he's 
here,

2084
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:31,040
he would have to leave.
You have to say hi and you have to ams.

2085
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:34,100
So you took Dan from my art books for a 
long time.

2086
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:34,990
He probably just knowing what is going 
on.

2087
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:37,130
He's a rock and roll star.
Dude probably doesn't know what the fuck

2088
01:28:37,131 --> 01:28:37,964
he's doing,
what he does or he thought he was 

2089
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:39,554
supposed to be here yesterday.
Then he told me it was going to be here 

2090
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:41,691
today and I was like,
Bro,

2091
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,070
I'm here today.
How are you here today?

2092
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:44,750
Does he do drugs Thursday?
No.

2093
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:45,501
No.
Nice.

2094
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:46,610
Good.
How's that possible?

2095
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,840
He smokes weed.
I don't want to dry snitch.

2096
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:50,000
So I think that's public,
right?

2097
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:52,460
Dry snitch.

2098
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,510
That the Angelo Russell Life,
you know what I mean?

2099
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:00,344
Like say and central Russel.
He's the guy that fucking the recorded 

2100
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:07,780
nick young talking about other girls.
Oh my gosh.

2101
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,620
He lives the drives.
He is Dutch market niche.

2102
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,503
Yeah.
And do they ostracized by the rest of 

2103
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:15,810
the basketball community?
Yeah,

2104
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,790
I should world.
I think the world.

2105
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:19,770
He said he didn't mean to let it get 
out.

2106
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,520
Right.
It's not,

2107
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,211
well,
his words,

2108
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:23,730
he needs to be on the gre.
You need the fucking ground.

2109
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:24,863
This not interested.
I would love to see you and you sit 

2110
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:31,050
down.
This is not an investigative reporter,

2111
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,810
meaning man,
I don't care.

2112
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:35,940
I'm just like,
don't hang out with that guy.

2113
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,250
Put a fucking scarlet Exxon.
I'm mentally,

2114
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,270
he should be out of the NBA dry snitch.
Well,

2115
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:45,690
I'm glad people are.
He doesn't get 30 things and in my plan.

2116
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,400
Thank you.
That's so nice.

2117
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,520
I'm glad people are looking at it that 
way though,

2118
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:51,354
that they have ostracized him instead of
like concentrating only on the guy who 

2119
01:29:54,871 --> 01:29:56,700
was banging other girls,
you know?

2120
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:57,870
Yes,
yes,

2121
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,630
yes,
yes.

2122
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,670
That you're,
you're right.

2123
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:00,504
The priorities are totally,
definitely solid priorities in that 

2124
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:06,690
case,
regardless of whether or not the guy who

2125
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,480
did the deed shouldn't have done it or 
should have done it,

2126
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,240
like whatever your opinions are about 
changing,

2127
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:12,703
that guy is violating a friendship.
Like that guy didn't tell him that 

2128
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:16,134
because he wanted the world to know.
He told them that because they're 

2129
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:18,564
friends.
I have friends that tell me dark shit 

2130
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:22,770
all the time.
They do when we laugh like pigs and I'll

2131
01:30:22,771 --> 01:30:23,604
never tell a soul,
I'll go to my grave with all that 

2132
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:27,060
knowledge.
And that's what a friend supposed to be.

2133
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,190
Any guy who would do that,
it's a piece of shit.

2134
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,023
So I'm glad that the,
the rules and principles of friendship 

2135
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:35,310
have overtaken the rules and principles 
of monogamy.

2136
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,540
Loyalty.
Yes.

2137
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:40,500
Tell me over to the people over the 
people you sleep with.

2138
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,783
But no,
it was interesting though because that 

2139
01:30:42,511 --> 01:30:44,100
same week it was,
uh,

2140
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:47,130
this,
this girl Kalani had supposedly,

2141
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:51,510
people had assumed she had cheated on 
her boyfriend who was in the NBA,

2142
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:52,560
Kyrie Irving.
Right.

2143
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:55,170
So then it's the Angela thing happened,
but when it was the girl,

2144
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,040
everyone beat her up over cheating or 
whatever and she actually didn't,

2145
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,550
she didn't even cheat with the Di Angelo
Nick young thing.

2146
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,310
Everyone was just mad at the Angela,
which de Angelo deserves.

2147
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:08,280
He's the worst person in that week.
But then also I was like,

2148
01:31:08,281 --> 01:31:09,870
well if you're going to be mad at 
Killarney,

2149
01:31:09,871 --> 01:31:12,420
then you gotta be mad at Nikki on,
which just don't be mad at either one of

2150
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:12,540
them.

2151
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,430
Cause who fucking cares?
That's the best.

2152
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:17,580
That's my friends also the girl,
I'm assuming it's hot,

2153
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:18,601
right?
She's great.

2154
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:20,970
I love Columbia.
Okay,

2155
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:24,540
here's the problem.
They're guys who can't fuck hot.

2156
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:26,760
Girls are always mad at them.
Yup,

2157
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,940
exactly.
We can't fuck 'em no matter of girls who

2158
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:33,530
will see hot girls wish they could be 
those hot girls and they're mad at me.

2159
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:36,450
Mad at him too hot.
Girls take more hate than anybody on the

2160
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:39,660
planet because the guys who can't fuck 
'em are always going to be upset.

2161
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:40,940
This bitch thing,
she's better than me.

2162
01:31:40,941 --> 01:31:41,401
And Blue,
blue,

2163
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:41,791
blue,
blue,

2164
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:43,050
blue.
And then the was like,

2165
01:31:43,051 --> 01:31:44,040
she ain't all that.
Yeah.

2166
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:46,890
And then the scripts girls just take,
take the constant negativity.

2167
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:47,803
Yep.
That's one of the problems with social 

2168
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:51,120
media.
Hot Girls get too much heat.

2169
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,070
Too much,
way too much.

2170
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,600
Nikki up Nikki on needs more heat.

2171
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,540
That guy's terrible.
But then when you know,

2172
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:57,563
you know coby so that the guy nick young
ass coby to sign his shoes after Kobe's 

2173
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:04,030
last game,
goes up to colby,

2174
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:07,540
would a pair of Adidas d coby takes her 
shoes and throw them in the trash.

2175
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,830
Doesn't sign them.
Whoa.

2176
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,000
I was like,
wow.

2177
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:12,340
I hated coby his whole career and I love
you now.

2178
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,700
He threw him in the trash in front of 
the dues and threw them in the trash.

2179
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,200
Whoa.
Incredible.

2180
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,120
Wow.
That's some real g shit.

2181
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,570
Just to let you know.
Yeah,

2182
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,490
but didn't coby do that shit with Shaq?
He threw shacks.

2183
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Shoes in the trash.
In the trash.

2184
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,473
Yeah.
Yeah.

2185
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,920
Colby is a little bit of a dry snitch to
game recognize game.

2186
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,270
That was it.
That was a game.

2187
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:37,590
Recognize game situation.
Dry snitch is my new favorite word.

2188
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,810
Yeah.
It's called people that dry snitch.

2189
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:41,673
Another good one is a dusty.
Do you call them a chili pimp with the 

2190
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:45,290
Chili powder?
Chili peppers.

2191
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:46,121
You're broke.
Pimp.

2192
01:32:46,121 --> 01:32:50,310
You ain't got shit chilies.
You cold outside Chile.

2193
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,660
Oh,
you want to go have a warm fur coat?

2194
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,460
Nothing.
Chile pimp.

2195
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,830
Dry snitch.
Chili pimp.

2196
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,330
He uses the bottom.
Sounds cool though.

2197
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:01,990
That doesn't like to be a chili pepper.
No,

2198
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,530
no.
Put it.

2199
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:06,820
Can we pull?
You don't want to be a Chili pip gel,

2200
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,030
but it sounds cool out there with the 
chips are negative at all.

2201
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:13,440
That's like you're hopping on one foot 
and your girls happen on the other ones.

2202
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,700
Well that's Nicole outside.
Yeah,

2203
01:33:15,701 --> 01:33:18,460
I get that.
But I mean it's chilly pimp sounds like.

2204
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:19,930
Oh,
he's just a chili pimp.

2205
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:20,943
Like your Kaiser Guess Sealer Chili's.
Him who was shivering because he only 

2206
01:33:23,351 --> 01:33:28,120
has one hole in his stable dude in the 
mall.

2207
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:30,120
Claimed he was pimping his pimp.

2208
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,890
One was big time,
but he ain't nothing but a Chili Pam.

2209
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:33,980
Yup.
That's how I use it.

2210
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:38,320
I tried to see urban dictionary.
So this world we live in here.

2211
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,183
Yup.
This is there's an actual dictionary 

2212
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:42,880
that gives you,
you could also buy the mug.

2213
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,440
You can buy a mug that says Chili pimp.
Oh,

2214
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,560
click on that.
We'll see what we've got here.

2215
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,211
Does it have,
oh,

2216
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:50,044
wait a minute.
Oh,

2217
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,520
I must have the definition on it.
Oh,

2218
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:57,180
that is so ridiculous.
This is going to be a gift from you.

2219
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,660
I can take this month.
I'll get you the chili pepper.

2220
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:01,300
I don't want it.
You don't know?

2221
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:02,134
Yeah,
you do,

2222
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,860
Jamie.
I feel like Chile.

2223
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:07,420
We need him drinking out of it at some 
bulletproof coffee out of the Chili Pimp

2224
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,790
Mug because they're spelling chili wrong
ditching.

2225
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,610
We get you a dress.
This spelling Chili,

2226
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:18,610
like the food.
I liked it.

2227
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:23,050
You liked that then that's like fire.
Oh my God.

2228
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:26,650
Look,
look who wrote the definition.

2229
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,220
Brooks and bad ass.
Yeah.

2230
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,293
Well,
this is one person's definition of 

2231
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:34,061
Chile.
Well,

2232
01:34:34,061 --> 01:34:37,510
what's a sapiosexual?
A CPO.

2233
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:38,770
Sexual.
The fuck.

2234
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:41,710
Anything that's not a monkey.
Dad's Homo sapiens.

2235
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,940
Is that what it is?
Sapiosexual one defines intelligence.

2236
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:49,000
The most sexually attractive feature.
What?

2237
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:50,920
Oh,
this is the urban dictionary.

2238
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,710
I want an incisive,
inquisitive,

2239
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:55,330
insightful,
irreverent mind.

2240
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:58,400
I want someone for whom?
Philosophical discussion.

2241
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,280
It's foreplay.
I want someone who sometimes makes me go

2242
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,470
out to do their wit and evil sense of 
humor.

2243
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,260
I want someone that can reach out and 
touch randomly.

2244
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:09,730
I want someone I can cuddle with.
I decided students,

2245
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:12,800
all that means I am sapiosexual.
You know what that sounds like.

2246
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:17,090
That sounds like a really lonely person 
who needs to get the shit together.

2247
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,193
Like when we never,
you read like someone's instagram and 

2248
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:21,710
it's filled with,
I'm looking for this.

2249
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:23,960
You know,
someone who loves you deeply does not.

2250
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:24,361
Bubba,
Bubba,

2251
01:35:24,361 --> 01:35:25,194
Bubba,
and they have this like that's how 

2252
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:28,010
lonely fucker.
Just leave him alone.

2253
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,400
Let's shoot.
What if Maya was,

2254
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:30,550
uh,
uh,

2255
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,493
Asiatic,
single Asiatic male seeks ride or die 

2256
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:34,581
chick?
Is that,

2257
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:35,900
that's perfect.
I like it.

2258
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,830
Cool.
That's funny.

2259
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,360
Cool.
See when it's funny,

2260
01:35:38,361 --> 01:35:39,440
it's cool,
but there's,

2261
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,413
if you just,
it's just for all them boys out there 

2262
01:35:41,961 --> 01:35:42,530
listening.

2263
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:43,670
Okay.
And girls too.

2264
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:44,504
If you're lesbians,
if you go to a girl's page and it's all 

2265
01:35:46,911 --> 01:35:49,550
this stuff about love and what true love
is,

2266
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:50,384
and when you find the one,
you'll know fucking we run from that 

2267
01:35:54,681 --> 01:35:55,514
person run now because that person's 
probably never happy and they just sit 

2268
01:35:58,851 --> 01:36:02,630
around posting memes about what true 
love is and they're going to make you go

2269
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,430
to brunch.
Those people like Brunch,

2270
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:06,610
Mimosas,
those Mimosa,

2271
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,270
drinking cunts.
Hey,

2272
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,790
eggs benedict can suck my dick.
How about that?

2273
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,690
Yeah,
no,

2274
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,720
that's right.
I want to check out of a mug.

2275
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,603
That's what I'm planning to Brunch.
I like girl that never wakes up early 

2276
01:36:20,301 --> 01:36:21,560
enough for brunch.
Like Shit,

2277
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:25,280
I missed a call again.
You're also an asshole if you got to pay

2278
01:36:25,281 --> 01:36:27,590
someone to make eggs,
like just fucking have eight.

2279
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:29,960
If you want eggs on the weekend,
just fucking make eggs.

2280
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:31,690
You can't let,
but sometimes you don't feel it.

2281
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:35,180
You feel like going somewhere though.
You'd see all eat dim sum.

2282
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,600
I'll wake up at like two and go eat dim 
sum things.

2283
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,340
You're racist.
Racist.

2284
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,550
I see what's going on.
I don't want to fucking roll dumplings.

2285
01:36:43,551 --> 01:36:44,384
I'll pay somebody to do that.
Let me ask you this cause this is an 

2286
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,200
important,
or even you know like fuck it,

2287
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,550
I'll eat,
I'll eat Mexican,

2288
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:51,380
I'll pay to eat Mexican food on the 
more,

2289
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:52,730
more,
more racism,

2290
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,740
more racism.
This is what I want to talk to you about

2291
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:55,574
because this is a,
this is a big subject is been going on 

2292
01:36:56,691 --> 01:36:57,340
now.

2293
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:58,173
This,
this term that didn't exist until 

2294
01:36:59,661 --> 01:37:02,180
recently.
Chile pit cultural appropriation,

2295
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,620
cultural appropriation that Rick bayless
guy who's a very famous Mexican chefs.

2296
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:07,483
Yeah,
that guy is taking shit from all these 

2297
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:11,820
social justice warrior dip shits because
he,

2298
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:14,750
he makes Mexican food and he's not 
Mexican.

2299
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:15,703
He's a white guy from Oklahoma and there
was this whole article about whether or 

2300
01:37:18,111 --> 01:37:20,580
not this guy who was one of the best 
Mexican cooks,

2301
01:37:20,581 --> 01:37:23,420
you think he's one of the best.
His food is not flowing.

2302
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,254
You tell me.
He's widely recognized as a highly 

2303
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:27,854
respected well here.
This is what makes people deep in this 

2304
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:32,010
is what makes us upset.
You're a guy like you,

2305
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:33,980
like you're one of those guys that's 
deep,

2306
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:34,970
deep,
deep in the world.

2307
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,100
Whereas like if you came to me and said,
oh my God,

2308
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:38,600
this guy,
I don't want to say anybody's name,

2309
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,220
but this guy is hilarious.
I'd be like,

2310
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,840
that guy was dog shit.
And he's got writers,

2311
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:42,883
you know what I mean?
Yeah,

2312
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,900
yeah.
So he's a guy that like,

2313
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:47,150
look,
his food's not bad,

2314
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,013
but it's not great.
It's definitely not the best Mexican 

2315
01:37:49,401 --> 01:37:51,500
food in America,
but he wins tons of awards.

2316
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:52,543
Is it?
Cause it's white?

2317
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:53,773
I,
I don't think it's because it's 

2318
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:56,400
complicated,

2319
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,950
right?
Because he's white isn't wrong,

2320
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:01,110
but it's,
it's the Quan.

2321
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:03,540
You remember like in Jerry Maguire that 
like the Quan,

2322
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:05,870
the thing with a lot of these shifts 
that win these awards,

2323
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:08,100
the food and wine,
best new chef,

2324
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:12,570
Michelin fucking James Beard.
It's a lot of the times because they can

2325
01:38:12,571 --> 01:38:13,404
speak English,
they can communicate with the writers 

2326
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,550
and the writers can write a story about 
them.

2327
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,010
They're not winning because it's the 
best food.

2328
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,410
They're winning because there's a story 
to write in,

2329
01:38:22,411 --> 01:38:23,244
a story to tell.
And Rick bayless being a white guy from 

2330
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:30,291
Oklahoma cooking maybe slightly above 
average Mexican is a story.

2331
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:33,750
Slightly have water grill.
It's not fucking good.

2332
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,370
Wait a minute.
Border Grill though.

2333
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,780
You have a bunch of other people cooking
it.

2334
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,970
Like what about when he's cooking it?
Wait,

2335
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,400
let me check it to his restaurant named 
Rick bayless.

2336
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,130
I remember eating,
I just don't want to be wrong.

2337
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:45,143
Fuck him.
He's the guy that's got Tara Grill 

2338
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,910
Frontera Grill.
Where's that at?

2339
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:52,110
I don't have to look.
And he's in the airports now.

2340
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:54,080
You've got all the airport restaurants,
but you know,

2341
01:38:54,081 --> 01:38:56,250
it's weird man.
If you're a standup comedian,

2342
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,113
okay.
And you open up a comedy club and some 

2343
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:00,670
whack ass comedian frontera grill.
Yes.

2344
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,750
If you're a standup comedian and you 
open up a comedy club and some whack ass

2345
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,490
comedian comes to performs at your 
comedy club,

2346
01:39:05,491 --> 01:39:06,750
no one says,
Hey,

2347
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:09,450
Joey Diaz is comedy club.
Uh,

2348
01:39:09,451 --> 01:39:11,920
I went there the other day and this guy 
went up and perform.

2349
01:39:11,921 --> 01:39:14,190
This guy sucks.
So Joe Diaz must be a bad comedian.

2350
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,040
Like if you were going to judge Rick 
Bayless,

2351
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,290
you would have to judge him by his own 
cooking.

2352
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,270
Have you ever eaten his own cooking?
Yeah.

2353
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,200
You have?
Yeah.

2354
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,740
We're at frontera grill.
But were you there when he called it?

2355
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:26,730
No,
I didn't meet him.

2356
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:27,810
But he didn't.
He wasn't there.

2357
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:31,500
No,
but here's the thing on the work,

2358
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,870
like it,
it doesn't matter if he's there or not.

2359
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:35,490
It's your restaurant.
That's your name on it.

2360
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:37,350
If somebody comes in a house and has a 
bad meal,

2361
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:38,184
that's on me.
I think we're splitting hairs because 

2362
01:39:39,211 --> 01:39:41,940
this is a restaurant where you're saying
his restaurants.

2363
01:39:41,941 --> 01:39:42,391
No.
Good.

2364
01:39:42,391 --> 01:39:45,090
That I understand.
But have you ever eaten his cooking?

2365
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:47,910
I mean,
I feel like if you're in the restaurant,

2366
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:48,631
that's his cooking.
No,

2367
01:39:48,631 --> 01:39:48,920
no,
no,

2368
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,421
no,
no,

2369
01:39:49,421 --> 01:39:50,700
no.
Is he cooked?

2370
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,120
Have you eaten what he cooked?
I have not sat in front of him and eaten

2371
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:55,100
when he's cooking there.
No.

2372
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,200
What the fuck?
This is what,

2373
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:59,490
that's what makes it,
if somebody makes a chef,

2374
01:39:59,491 --> 01:40:00,000
right.
You know what?

2375
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,410
I caught a bad review.
I was,

2376
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,260
I was known for catching this bad 
review.

2377
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,860
Um,
at Shalia I had a restaurant,

2378
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:09,840
Sam Sifton came in,
I was sitting in the dining room,

2379
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:12,180
I was not cooking and he did not have a 
great meal.

2380
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,340
And you know what?
I took it on the face and I owned it.

2381
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:15,950
And the thing is,
Rick Bailey,

2382
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,550
she doesn't make bad food.
It's just,

2383
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:21,750
it's not for all the accolades he has.
It's not the best.

2384
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:26,751
But also there's a bit of a thing with 
food that the literati,

2385
01:40:27,871 --> 01:40:28,920
the intelligence,
you,

2386
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:30,450
the blogs,
the magazines,

2387
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:33,540
they're always electing people that they
can tell a story about,

2388
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:35,360
speak English,
have this she,

2389
01:40:35,361 --> 01:40:37,230
she dining room.
They're not,

2390
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:39,270
it's not about the food they always 
make,

2391
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:40,950
they always talk about the food,
but it's not.

2392
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:44,820
And I think that people of ethnic 
cultures from the,

2393
01:40:44,821 --> 01:40:45,654
you know,
the background of Mexican food and 

2394
01:40:46,981 --> 01:40:47,814
things like that,
people get upset when there's somebody 

2395
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:51,690
else that didn't live the life,
didn't grow up with.

2396
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:53,980
It isn't the best at

2397
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,020
it representing it.
You know,

2398
01:40:56,021 --> 01:40:57,690
like if it's going to be somebody from 
outside,

2399
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,533
he better be the fucking best.
Otherwise get somebody who lived this 

2400
01:41:00,611 --> 01:41:01,444
life and knows all the history and 
identity and culture attached to this 

2401
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:05,410
food and let them speak for their own 
food.

2402
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:07,083
Part of the problem,
this conversation is you want to talk 

2403
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:09,940
about the restaurant.
This guy runs,

2404
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:14,620
I want to talk about him as a chef and 
I'm saying you haven't had his food as a

2405
01:41:14,621 --> 01:41:15,454
chef.
Now what I've read is that he makes 

2406
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,273
excellent Mexican food and he really is 
a student of the culture and is an 

2407
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:23,043
amorous by Mexican culture and Mexican 
traditions and he's essentially a 

2408
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:29,260
scholar of Mexican food.
I don't think he's done anything wrong.

2409
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:31,750
I want to put that on there.
But you never does anything wrong.

2410
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:32,920
Right?
I went to his restaurant,

2411
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:34,570
but you would have the best one that had
the food,

2412
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:36,110
but you've never had it from him.

2413
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:38,050
But isn't that,
doesn't that mean something?

2414
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,640
But you're saying it like it's not as 
big a deal.

2415
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:41,290
It's not because in the restaurant 
industry,

2416
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,124
the things,
if you walk in once you walk in the 

2417
01:41:43,241 --> 01:41:44,290
door,
that's that man's food.

2418
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,840
Oh man,
fuck all that man's food.

2419
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:47,720
I agree with them.
I mean,

2420
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:48,553
it's his recipe.
He's putting his whole thing he created 

2421
01:41:50,141 --> 01:41:52,630
on the line and going,
he's not cooking it.

2422
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:54,660
I just feel like,
you know,

2423
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:56,320
if you're leaving it to someone else to 
do it,

2424
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:57,670
I mean you,
you might've had the bad,

2425
01:41:57,671 --> 01:41:59,800
it's like if you're an architect and you
know,

2426
01:41:59,801 --> 01:42:00,300
you're,
uh,

2427
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,133
you're,
you're a a builder of a house and 

2428
01:42:02,381 --> 01:42:05,260
someone comes along and does a shitty 
job building your creation.

2429
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:06,910
Are you responsible?
Well,

2430
01:42:06,911 --> 01:42:11,250
if you were supposed to oversee every 
single aspect of the construction beyond

2431
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,093
him,
cause I don't think he's done anything 

2432
01:42:12,881 --> 01:42:13,180
wrong.

2433
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:15,160
And this is,
this is the one thing in this discussion

2434
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:16,990
that I feel is unfair to some of these 
chefs,

2435
01:42:16,991 --> 01:42:20,290
especially the white chefs,
is it's not their fault that journalists

2436
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:22,480
and people want to give them more.
Somebody wants to give him more.

2437
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:24,220
I don't expect them to throw it in the 
fucking ground.

2438
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,530
You know?
The problem though is,

2439
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,423
is the media and the people giving these
awards and the ones selecting saying 

2440
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:33,310
this is the best chef,
this is the best Mexican food.

2441
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:37,120
It's really obnoxious to the people of 
that culture that are like,

2442
01:42:37,121 --> 01:42:37,954
dude,
that's not really representing who we 

2443
01:42:39,341 --> 01:42:41,410
are,
but now this guy's representing our food

2444
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:42,244
in America,
and he's the one you go to for 

2445
01:42:43,571 --> 01:42:45,190
information.
Can we your talk,

2446
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:46,923
let me just be honest with you.
No one who goes to restaurants knows 

2447
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:50,470
about awards.
No one.

2448
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:54,340
It's so rare that anyone ever discusses 
awards,

2449
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:55,480
but it's so a platform.

2450
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:58,330
They give them the platform to speak 
from Mexican food in America.

2451
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,640
You know,
he's a guy people go to on top chef.

2452
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:02,730
They always bring them in.
You know that,

2453
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,633
that you've given him the platform and 
you've given him the megaphone to speak 

2454
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:09,220
for a cultural fair,
but part of like awards not,

2455
01:43:09,221 --> 01:43:10,600
you know,
anybody that wins.

2456
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,580
I don't know what the fucking awards are
for food.

2457
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:14,950
I just know when someone's supposed to 
be a famous chef.

2458
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:15,940
Did,
that's,

2459
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,430
that's the thing is he's been elevated 
as the famous chef.

2460
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:21,430
When you have the Aztec Karachi 
restaurant in highland park,

2461
01:43:21,431 --> 01:43:23,730
that's fucking fire.
Where's the tiny CIF lining?

2462
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:24,790
Hold it.
Say it again.

2463
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:25,990
Uh,
as tech.

2464
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,210
It's the Aztec Herati restaurant of 
highland park.

2465
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,460
What is it?
Um,

2466
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:32,830
they sell her archie's.
They're awesome.

2467
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:35,680
What's a Hirachio?
[inaudible] they're like a,

2468
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:38,130
it's like a man.
It's uh,

2469
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,300
I have to pull up a photo.
It's hard to explain.

2470
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:43,900
It's like a corn.
It's like almost like an open faced,

2471
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:49,470
I would explain it as an open faced a 
raper what the fuck's in a rape?

2472
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,070
It's a corn Masa.
This,

2473
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,330
it,
this is not my specialty.

2474
01:43:53,331 --> 01:43:55,180
You know what I'm saying?
If there's a child tamale,

2475
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,500
no,
it's corn meal.

2476
01:43:57,501 --> 01:44:00,140
You kind of have to see it to we bull 
liberace,

2477
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:05,200
h u r a c h e but um,
yeah,

2478
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,950
see,
okay.

2479
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,280
And that,
that's what,

2480
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,950
as tech and highland park,
that thing,

2481
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,530
it's like flat bread bro.
Tree like flatbread.

2482
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,730
You pick it up.
Yeah.

2483
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,240
Yeah.
So it's hard to buy.

2484
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:19,190
You cut it,
you cut it.

2485
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:22,040
So it cut eating corn meal on the 
bottom.

2486
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,560
It's incredible.
You got to have one of these things,

2487
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,670
I believe you.
And then,

2488
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:27,950
uh,
also connie seafood and Inglewood is one

2489
01:44:27,951 --> 01:44:30,820
of the best Mexican restaurants you'll 
ever eat.

2490
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,550
Excellent Mexican restaurants.
But,

2491
01:44:32,551 --> 01:44:33,680
but my point being,
I was like,

2492
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:34,514
does this guy,
so you think it's deserve it that he's 

2493
01:44:36,801 --> 01:44:40,330
getting shit because not because he's 
the best Max.

2494
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:41,870
Cause he's,
he's getting all these accolades,

2495
01:44:41,871 --> 01:44:42,704
not because he's the best,
but because it's easy to write a story 

2496
01:44:44,241 --> 01:44:45,074
about him because he's a white guy from 
Oklahoma and he's very articulate when 

2497
01:44:48,441 --> 01:44:49,274
it comes to this.
And the people that select the 

2498
01:44:51,651 --> 01:44:54,590
gatekeepers and the,
the people who speak for culture,

2499
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:55,483
they're picking a guide they can 
communicate with easily makes their job 

2500
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:02,120
easy and can tell a story that's like 
easily disseminate it,

2501
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:03,013
easily disseminated amongst the masses.
And I don't think it's Rick Bayless is 

2502
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:06,374
full.
I don't think rick bayless has done 

2503
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:10,670
anything wrong.
Like in this context ever.

2504
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:15,530
It's the media selecting him as you are 
now the spokesperson for Mexican food in

2505
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:17,270
America.
And it's like this motherfucker,

2506
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,820
like if you're Mexican you'd be tight.
Right?

2507
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:21,280
You'd be mad at that.
Yeah.

2508
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,060
Well,
so who should be on the show?

2509
01:45:23,061 --> 01:45:24,560
Right.
So when we went to China,

2510
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:26,840
I was craving American food.

2511
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,520
I was in China for 17 days and I was 
like,

2512
01:45:28,521 --> 01:45:29,354
you know what,
I miss fucking hamburgers and a salad 

2513
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:32,024
and Nachos.
And we went to a place called Deli 

2514
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:34,093
Burger.
It was the most popular American 

2515
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:39,020
restaurant for ex pats in Hunan,
China.

2516
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,123
And we went,
this place had like pulp fiction 

2517
01:45:41,271 --> 01:45:43,280
posters.
Big Lebowski was interesting.

2518
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:48,281
They had like a Philips like fucking 
French dip logo thing in there.

2519
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:50,390
They collected all these American 
artifacts.

2520
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:51,224
They bought an Amazon,
we ate their hamburger and it tasted 

2521
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:56,450
like Chinese food.
It was hilarious.

2522
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,720
This is delicious hamburger,
but it wasn't a hamburger.

2523
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:02,450
It tasted like they had a philly cheese 
steak.

2524
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,310
And my buddy was like,
he's,

2525
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:06,470
he's from Van Nuys.
He ate it and he was like,

2526
01:46:06,471 --> 01:46:07,304
listen,
I have so many friends that are Mexican 

2527
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:10,994
or Asian growing up in La that get mad 
when white people or people not of the 

2528
01:46:15,681 --> 01:46:17,660
culture make their food.

2529
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:19,910
And they're like,
this isn't representing us.

2530
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:22,600
This isn't what they said does not map 
Mapo Tofu.

2531
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,700
This is not a soup dumpling.
This is some chef's creation.

2532
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:26,893
And he goes,
I never understood why they got mad 

2533
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:30,110
until I ate this philly cheese steak 
cause he,

2534
01:46:30,111 --> 01:46:30,944
this is not a philly cheese steak,
this is like stir fried beef in bread 

2535
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,193
and they should call it the Hunan Hoagie
cause it tastes good but it is not a 

2536
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:39,434
philly cheese steak.
And I love philly cheese steaks and I 

2537
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:42,044
love hamburgers.
And it's like when you see something 

2538
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:44,864
that you love being called something 
else and being represented a different 

2539
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:49,630
way,
it's upsetting because your identify.

2540
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:50,340
But

2541
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:51,173
Rick Bayless in his defense does follow 
traditional Mexican cooking methods and 

2542
01:46:55,411 --> 01:46:57,120
makes food that tastes like Mexican 
food.

2543
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:58,920
Yes,
yes,

2544
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,000
yes,
yes.

2545
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:03,570
But the thing is is that he's a fan and 
he's a degree removed.

2546
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,610
And it's like if you're gonna go to a 
source,

2547
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:08,130
why not just go to the source?
If for,

2548
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,660
for many cultures,
you know,

2549
01:47:09,661 --> 01:47:11,970
like Andy Ricker is a really good friend
of mine,

2550
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,860
but when people talk about Thai food in 
America,

2551
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:16,950
they go to him and he's a white guy from
Portland to Andy's credit.

2552
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,590
And he is one of my best friends and I 
love him for this.

2553
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:20,693
He puts the names of the Thai people 
that taught them things on his menu as 

2554
01:47:23,701 --> 01:47:24,534
much as he can.
He pushes the credit and he pushes 

2555
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:28,680
people towards the Thai people he 
learned from,

2556
01:47:28,681 --> 01:47:31,890
so they can get it from the source.
But these journalists are fucking lazy.

2557
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,110
They don't care.
They don't go talk to those people.

2558
01:47:34,111 --> 01:47:34,944
It's harder because it's easier to call 
a guy that speaks English and 

2559
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:39,270
communicate with you.
But journalists,

2560
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:43,830
they can write one shitty restaurant 
review and just take you down.

2561
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:47,430
They have that power and that power is 
really intoxicating,

2562
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:48,264
isn't it?
Yeah.

2563
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:51,720
Have you ever dealt with like douchey 
journalists that you felt like were kind

2564
01:47:51,721 --> 01:47:52,554
of out to get you?

2565
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:56,563
Yeah,
there's a few people that I've done 

2566
01:47:57,831 --> 01:47:58,664
interviews with in the first five 
minutes I could tell they're out to get 

2567
01:48:00,621 --> 01:48:01,454
me,
but then once they can tell him pretty 

2568
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:04,970
genuine and honest and straight forward,
they're like,

2569
01:48:04,971 --> 01:48:06,440
all right,
I'll love with this guy.

2570
01:48:06,441 --> 01:48:07,340
I'll talk to him.
So no,

2571
01:48:07,341 --> 01:48:08,510
I,
I don't,

2572
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,150
I would not say that there were people 
that were out.

2573
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:13,430
There's a couple,
but I can't even remember them because I

2574
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:14,320
don't care.
Right,

2575
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:15,273
right.
Well it's getting harder and harder to 

2576
01:48:16,761 --> 01:48:18,830
do that these days too because of the 
Internet.

2577
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,870
You know,
if someone writes a shitty review,

2578
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:21,704
it's so easy to out that person and 
describe what exactly it was going on 

2579
01:48:24,231 --> 01:48:25,760
behind the scenes and who that person 
really.

2580
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,680
And I respond on Ige,
twitter,

2581
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:29,700
youtube people have a problem.
They want to ask me something,

2582
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,430
I'll answer it.
So I'm kind of,

2583
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:32,293
it's hard to do the hip piece,
the Ami cause it's like my information 

2584
01:48:34,261 --> 01:48:35,094
is all out there.

2585
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,190
Right.
People know they can talk to me.

2586
01:48:37,191 --> 01:48:38,450
I got the answer.
Right,

2587
01:48:38,451 --> 01:48:38,960
right,
right.

2588
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,800
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2589
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,450
What do you think is the future when it 
comes to a tee?

2590
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:44,683
I think like yelp reviews of common 
taken away a lot of the steam from a 

2591
01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:49,603
journalist's reviewing restaurants.
Cause a lot of people when they want to 

2592
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:54,710
find out about a restaurant they'll go 
to a yelp review.

2593
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:55,550
You know,
they'll say,

2594
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:57,200
oh well look at this four and a half 
stars on yelp.

2595
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,063
Let me read a couple reviews.
And you read a couple reviews and he 

2596
01:49:00,021 --> 01:49:00,854
goes,
see what their other reviews are at 

2597
01:49:01,251 --> 01:49:02,084
other restaurants.
You find out whether or not they're 

2598
01:49:02,781 --> 01:49:04,880
accurate or that's,
that's disturbing.

2599
01:49:04,881 --> 01:49:05,714
When you find someone who's a Shill,
when you definitely can tell that 

2600
01:49:08,301 --> 01:49:11,280
someone was like hired by that 
restaurant to write some bullshit peas.

2601
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:13,490
They only have one review and it's at 
that restaurant.

2602
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:16,850
It's super obvious yet.
That's just annoying man.

2603
01:49:16,851 --> 01:49:19,220
But I feel people are figuring it all 
out.

2604
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:21,950
Like at the end of the day,
the cream rises to the top.

2605
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,810
You fucking figure it out.
Right.

2606
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:24,763
You know?
That's why a lot of the stuff you were 

2607
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:28,010
saying is choose like hard work pays 
off,

2608
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:30,230
you know,
fucking the people who deserve it to get

2609
01:49:30,231 --> 01:49:30,980
it,
you know?

2610
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,210
That's right.
I fucking do it.

2611
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:34,730
Fuck that.
30 grand a year can't give people money.

2612
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:35,923
Yeah.
So I love like we started this 

2613
01:49:38,481 --> 01:49:39,314
conversation.
I love the hate because it helps me get 

2614
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:44,150
better at like hearing the criticism.
I like to work on my game.

2615
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,970
I like to work on myself,
but at the end of the,

2616
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,010
I don't hold onto it

2617
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,770
anymore because your destiny is in your 
hands.

2618
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:51,723
Whatever you want.
You may have to work harder than 

2619
01:49:52,931 --> 01:49:55,030
somebody else,
but if you work hard,

2620
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:57,190
you can do it.
You can get there.

2621
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,860
I genuinely believe that.
What do you like doing better?

2622
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:00,723
Do you like working as a chef and 
cooking and owning a restaurant or do 

2623
01:50:04,091 --> 01:50:06,460
you like doing these tv shows and all 
this craziness you do?

2624
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:07,323
My favorite thing is writing real love 
writing because I think writing if 

2625
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:13,510
forces me to be the most honest with 
myself,

2626
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:17,470
I get to work on myself and get closer 
to like figuring out what life is about,

2627
01:50:17,471 --> 01:50:20,050
like the meaning of life shit,
and not to be Corny,

2628
01:50:20,051 --> 01:50:20,884
but I wake up and I think about it and 
when I write every morning I get closer 

2629
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:26,320
and I'm puling back layers and I love 
that.

2630
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,990
But cooking basketball,
when I'm,

2631
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,390
when I'm playing or I'm cooking,
it teaches me things,

2632
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:33,370
but the place I go to figure it out as 
writing.

2633
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:36,430
I love writing.
How often you write?

2634
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,280
Every morning I woke up every morning.
I do,

2635
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:42,150
it may not be that much,
but I'll write something to myself.

2636
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,450
I write it down,
write ideas.

2637
01:50:43,451 --> 01:50:45,430
I have tons of Google docs.
Always Open.

2638
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,420
Really?
Yeah.

2639
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,810
Like what kind of writing screenplays 
books?

2640
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:52,450
Uh,
ideas.

2641
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,553
Just,
I just,

2642
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,240
I'm always writing.
I always have,

2643
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,130
I always have a couple projects I'm 
writing.

2644
01:50:57,131 --> 01:50:58,840
Like I have a fiction book I'm writing 
right now.

2645
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:59,703
Really?
Yeah.

2646
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,600
And I'm at work.
Um,

2647
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:04,910
I don't,
I don't want it.

2648
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:06,370
You don't,
it's a,

2649
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:10,540
the last book I wrote was a romance and 
it was a nonfiction about my life.

2650
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,880
But the one thing,
yeah,

2651
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,360
coming out May 31st called Double Cup 
love.

2652
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,630
And it's about,
I think you might've met my,

2653
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:22,030
my fiance the first time I came on the 
show.

2654
01:51:22,031 --> 01:51:25,090
I think she came with me first time 
anyway,

2655
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:25,630
maybe.

2656
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:27,040
Yeah.
But yeah,

2657
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:28,130
no,
I,

2658
01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:28,963
I wrote about it.
It was about my journey back to China 

2659
01:51:30,641 --> 01:51:32,620
with my brothers.
So I wrote that book.

2660
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,330
But I think,
you know,

2661
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:35,164
nonfiction,
it's hard to keep putting yourself out 

2662
01:51:37,451 --> 01:51:38,284
there in the most honest way.
So I started writing fiction because I 

2663
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:41,854
want to write about my life,
but I want to like kind of grounded in 

2664
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,193
other characters and things like that 
and explore it and work through the 

2665
01:51:49,781 --> 01:51:51,640
ideas.
So it's been interesting.

2666
01:51:51,641 --> 01:51:53,440
I've been doing that.
I'm trying to like write fiction.

2667
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:55,330
Wow,
that's interesting.

2668
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:57,490
Yeah.
You've been doing this for how long?

2669
01:51:58,180 --> 01:51:59,800
The last six months I've been doing a 
fiction,

2670
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:00,634
but I've been writing my whole life ever
since like ninth grade I was in the 

2671
01:52:03,821 --> 01:52:04,930
writing.
Really?

2672
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,370
Yeah.
Wow.

2673
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:07,840
So you were pretty diverse guy,
man.

2674
01:52:07,841 --> 01:52:09,430
You got this.
One of the things I like about you,

2675
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:10,960
you've always got a bunch of irons in 
the fire.

2676
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,160
Thanks man.
Yeah,

2677
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,270
I wrote a screenplay about,
uh,

2678
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,190
uh,
uh,

2679
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:17,050
suicidal basketball player,
like a kid,

2680
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:17,884
teenage kid going through a lot of shit.
So I wrote about some of the things I 

2681
01:52:21,011 --> 01:52:21,844
remember,
me and my friends going through teenage 

2682
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:23,854
years,
put it into a basketball player from 

2683
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:27,590
Queens.
So wrote that screenplay.

2684
01:52:27,591 --> 01:52:28,660
I'm,
I'm always writing,

2685
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:32,020
like picking up pieces from my life and 
creating characters.

2686
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:34,180
What do you use to write?
What would a program,

2687
01:52:34,181 --> 01:52:37,330
do you use a final draft?
But I'm farming idiot dude.

2688
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:39,940
I turned into my homie that works at 
mgm.

2689
01:52:39,941 --> 01:52:42,400
I sent him a screenplay in Microsoft 
word and he's like,

2690
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:43,953
this shit is fire,
but you have to put this in fucking 

2691
01:52:45,261 --> 01:52:46,050
final draft,
you know,

2692
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:48,070
clown,
so can,

2693
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,510
is it not,
it's not that easy to convert the,

2694
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,300
you have to actually like write the 
whole fucking thing out.

2695
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:54,393
You've got to do it again.
He just rewrote the whole thing was 

2696
01:52:56,481 --> 01:52:58,850
funny.
But when you could have two windows open

2697
01:52:58,851 --> 01:53:00,980
at the same time,
just copy and paste back and forth.

2698
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,840
So it's not that brutal.
Not too brutal.

2699
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:03,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2700
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:05,060
I,
I wrote some stuff from final draft,

2701
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:05,841
final drafts,
tricky.

2702
01:53:05,841 --> 01:53:08,990
But once you get used to the shortcuts 
and how to use the commands,

2703
01:53:09,490 --> 01:53:10,490
you know,
but um,

2704
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:12,780
have you had for writing ideas?
Um,

2705
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,090
have you ever used a right room?
Do you know what that is?

2706
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:17,060
It's pretty dope.
It's,

2707
01:53:17,061 --> 01:53:18,920
um,
a program where you,

2708
01:53:18,921 --> 01:53:21,470
it blocks out everything in your screen 
except for,

2709
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:22,580
uh,
the writing.

2710
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:25,160
You can't go into your browsers,
you can't,

2711
01:53:25,161 --> 01:53:26,420
you don't get any notifications.

2712
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,253
You don't do shit.
It just shows you only the writing and 

2713
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:31,040
uh,
it gives you a look like,

2714
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:32,180
look at that.
Like that.

2715
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:34,130
That's good.
It's what your screen looks like.

2716
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:37,730
It's just a,
a black screen with green ink and that's

2717
01:53:37,731 --> 01:53:39,110
all you get.
See that would,

2718
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:41,510
the green ink would drive me crazy.
But what I do,

2719
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:42,860
man,
fuck him in the terminator,

2720
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:43,903
I get in the zone.
I'm really good about getting in the 

2721
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:47,270
zone.
I play one song,

2722
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:51,050
I'll play one song and I'll loop it and 
I'll listen to the same song for like 12

2723
01:53:51,051 --> 01:53:54,500
hours just over and oh,
what's offer any like,

2724
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,353
it'll just be a song that day.
Like I've had like random jazz song or 

2725
01:54:00,951 --> 01:54:04,160
it'll be like the Smith and Wesson or 
Lana del Rey or can't blow.

2726
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:08,510
And I'll just play that song looped for 
hours and hours and hours.

2727
01:54:08,511 --> 01:54:11,030
And it gets in a trance cause you stop 
listening to the song.

2728
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,490
It's just noise.
Right,

2729
01:54:13,491 --> 01:54:13,911
right,
right,

2730
01:54:13,911 --> 01:54:14,744
right.
It's just,

2731
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,980
yeah,
I've done that before.

2732
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:16,890
Yeah.
Yeah,

2733
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:19,580
I've done that on airplanes in 
particular.

2734
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:22,480
I like to write on airplanes for some 
strange good.

2735
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,170
You get focused also,
you're positive.

2736
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:27,950
It's like the altitude thing.
Altitude helps makes you positive.

2737
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:28,873
There's like studies,
you do that then it's like you get 

2738
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,330
euphoria in the air.
When you're that high up,

2739
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:35,100
it's because there's no air up there.
Uh,

2740
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:37,280
rain's falling asleep.
Something,

2741
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,920
something,
some shit about altitude.

2742
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:40,740
It gives you,
you for,

2743
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,590
this is another great program called 
scrivener.

2744
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:43,880
You ever tried that?
You know what that is?

2745
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:46,870
It's a program that allows you to have 
like a,

2746
01:54:46,871 --> 01:54:48,640
um,
a virtual chalk ball,

2747
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:49,483
cork board,
and it has all these little index cards 

2748
01:54:51,471 --> 01:54:54,920
and you move around the cork board.
So I'll show you a here.

2749
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:57,080
I've got it open up here.
And when you,

2750
01:54:57,081 --> 01:54:58,880
uh,
you could take some of your ideas and he

2751
01:54:58,881 --> 01:55:02,120
could write them on these little 
corkboard things and then,

2752
01:55:02,121 --> 01:55:03,170
uh,
as you,

2753
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:07,190
uh,
I'll show you when it loads up other,

2754
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:08,053
Jamie's got it.

2755
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:11,690
Yeah.
So like that.

2756
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:14,570
So it gives you the option to do these 
little,

2757
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:19,190
so I got it like here and you put these 
little little notes,

2758
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,083
like little,
there's little tiny little fake index 

2759
01:55:21,561 --> 01:55:24,120
cards and you can move these suckers 
around on this.

2760
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,980
It's called scrivener.
So you write a lot of screenplays,

2761
01:55:27,981 --> 01:55:28,814
Huh?
No.

2762
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:29,660
Oh No,
I don't.

2763
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:30,523
I write,
I used to write a bunch of different 

2764
01:55:32,571 --> 01:55:33,404
stuff,
but now primarily what I do is I write 

2765
01:55:34,671 --> 01:55:37,460
essays and out of those essays I take 
stand up ideas.

2766
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:41,300
I used to ride a lot of blog entries,
but I found out that a lot of those blog

2767
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:42,134
entries would eventually become standup 
and it was always like I was giving 

2768
01:55:43,981 --> 01:55:45,930
people a preview of the standup.
I'm like,

2769
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:48,960
better to write them for myself and then
just steal from them.

2770
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:50,820
Also,
I'm way into,

2771
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:51,960
I used to do a blog too.

2772
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,793
I love blogging,
but I'm at a point now where I feel 

2773
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,300
people are such exhibitionists you do 
something.

2774
01:55:57,301 --> 01:55:59,550
He just immediately put it,
I want to see what people think.

2775
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:01,110
Read my shit.
I'm like,

2776
01:56:01,111 --> 01:56:01,890
you know what,
men,

2777
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:04,740
unless I made a Samurai sword,
I don't want you to see it cause I don't

2778
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:05,574
want to waste your time.
I want you to see the most fire shit I 

2779
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:10,290
made and I worked hard on it.
It's worth your time.

2780
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,570
That's a good attitude.
Sometimes though,

2781
01:56:12,571 --> 01:56:16,120
I like reading people's blogs.
Sometimes someone will write a Bra,

2782
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:17,520
a blog,
and it'll change your day,

2783
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:18,443
you know,
just to change the frequency of the way 

2784
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:20,364
you think.
And just for whatever reason their 

2785
01:56:22,321 --> 01:56:23,154
thought just makes it into your mind and
bounces around in there and it changes 

2786
01:56:26,071 --> 01:56:26,770
some things.
Yeah.

2787
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:28,190
I don't think it's bad.
The right blocks.

2788
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,990
I just think everybody's doing it.
And for me personally,

2789
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:31,830
I'm like,
you know what?

2790
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:35,040
I'd like to be in the lab and just only 
put something out.

2791
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,430
I put allowed a lot of shit about my 
life in the last few years.

2792
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:42,030
So I'm kind of making sure I really want
to share these things now.

2793
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,380
Right.
Yeah.

2794
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:44,363
That's a thing about sharing.
You can't unshare you can't unshare 

2795
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:48,740
yeah.
And it's,

2796
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:49,610
it's Kinda,
it's,

2797
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:50,443
it's an interesting psychological thing.
This constantly giving yourself up to 

2798
01:56:53,461 --> 01:56:54,330
the Internet.
Well,

2799
01:56:54,331 --> 01:56:56,790
so there's a lot of people that live 
inside their phone.

2800
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:57,913
Yeah.
They live inside their laptop and their 

2801
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:00,054
phone,
they live in it and their interaction 

2802
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:03,270
with the world comes directly through 
that.

2803
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,860
That's their filter.
That's their condom for,

2804
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:06,810
for,
you know,

2805
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,530
intimacy with the world.
Yeah.

2806
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:09,720
It's very strange.
Yeah.

2807
01:57:09,721 --> 01:57:12,450
We're going to learn a lot about 
ourselves constantly.

2808
01:57:12,451 --> 01:57:13,284
And then,
I mean we're always learning about 

2809
01:57:14,401 --> 01:57:15,870
ourselves,
but I think this internet thing,

2810
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:18,600
it's people are starting to see,
wow,

2811
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:20,280
I put a lot of my shit out there.

2812
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:23,850
Like I'm kind of naked out there.
And then is this really who I am is just

2813
01:57:23,851 --> 01:57:27,180
some fucking alter ego.
So I'm interested to see how this starts

2814
01:57:27,181 --> 01:57:29,460
to affect psychology and identity.
Well,

2815
01:57:29,461 --> 01:57:31,470
it's definitely affecting young kids.
I mean,

2816
01:57:31,471 --> 01:57:34,440
young kids today are so much more 
exposed and we were,

2817
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:36,270
when we were kids,
it's not even close.

2818
01:57:36,271 --> 01:57:39,360
If you're going to high school today.
I mean everything is on instagram.

2819
01:57:39,361 --> 01:57:41,500
Everything is on facebook.
Anything that happens,

2820
01:57:41,501 --> 01:57:43,020
it's even remotely interesting in 
school.

2821
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:44,190
Gets put out there.
Yeah.

2822
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:46,560
I mean this,
this is the world we live in today.

2823
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:48,180
It's very different.
When I was just going to school,

2824
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:51,300
nobody knew shit.
You heard a rumor about some girl across

2825
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:52,710
town that jerk some dude off and you're 
like,

2826
01:57:52,711 --> 01:57:53,310
whoa,
whoa,

2827
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:54,143
whoa.
Let me go jerk off and thinking about 

2828
01:57:55,651 --> 01:57:57,990
that.
But nobody,

2829
01:57:57,991 --> 01:58:00,840
you know,
nobody like put it out there in that way

2830
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:01,674
where the rest of the world could look 
at it and the rest of the world can see 

2831
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:06,570
virtually anything that you put online 
today.

2832
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:09,420
It's just a strange thing because when 
you're young,

2833
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:12,060
you also don't understand the 
consequences.

2834
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:13,050
No.
When you're,

2835
01:58:13,110 --> 01:58:16,230
you're talking shit or saying something 
or posting something,

2836
01:58:16,231 --> 01:58:19,110
you really have no idea what,
what that's gonna do to people.

2837
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:20,460
We look at these things,
it's like,

2838
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,530
Oh,
you got 10,000 followers,

2839
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:24,810
20,000 a hundred thousand million,
right?

2840
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:30,120
I don't think it registers like 10,000 
people is a lot of fucking people.

2841
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:31,280
Lots of neat.
It's camp.

2842
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:32,123
All you need is one and that one to get 
to someone who has 10,000 and that 

2843
01:58:35,101 --> 01:58:35,934
10,001 of those 10,000 someone in that 
group has 20,000 and that person knows 

2844
01:58:40,711 --> 01:58:42,880
someone who's got 1,000,003

2845
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:43,713
or four steps.
All of a sudden a million people have 

2846
01:58:46,031 --> 01:58:46,864
seen that.
And then if it's funny or it's crazy or 

2847
01:58:49,211 --> 01:58:52,570
it's interesting like here's another 
cultural appropriation story.

2848
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:53,703
There's this kid who was taken shit from
this girl because he's a white guy with 

2849
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:58,960
dreadlocks and I don't know if you saw 
this,

2850
01:58:58,961 --> 01:58:59,794
but there was this black girl and 
there's this college in northern 

2851
01:59:02,021 --> 01:59:05,830
California and she was given this little
tiny white dude a hard time.

2852
01:59:05,831 --> 01:59:06,940
She was just bullying him,
man.

2853
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:09,160
It was gross.
And she was telling them,

2854
01:59:09,161 --> 01:59:10,240
you know,
cut your hair.

2855
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:12,370
You have any saying to a friend,
you have any scissors,

2856
01:59:12,371 --> 01:59:13,450
I'm going to cut your hair.
And he's like,

2857
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:14,530
why can't I wear this?
She goes,

2858
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:17,200
cause you stealing from my culture,
which is ignorant on her part.

2859
01:59:17,201 --> 01:59:20,200
She doesn't even know any better because
the Greeks had dreadlocks,

2860
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:22,180
the vikings had dreadlocks,
dreadlocks.

2861
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:24,760
It was what happens when you have dirty 
hair,

2862
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:27,730
when you have dirty hair and it knots up
in these loops.

2863
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:29,440
Anyway,
that video,

2864
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,303
someone was filming her bullying these a
little tiny dude and this video of this 

2865
01:59:34,151 --> 01:59:36,820
black girl bullying this tiny little 
white guy,

2866
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:37,983
God,
fucking millions and millions of hits 

2867
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,583
within a day because people recognize 
that and they were disgusted by it and 

2868
01:59:44,441 --> 01:59:49,441
then people are also tired of all these 
self appointed gatekeepers,

2869
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:50,643
self appointed,
but you know people that can tell 

2870
01:59:51,761 --> 01:59:52,594
people.
One of the beautiful things about 

2871
01:59:53,261 --> 01:59:56,920
culture is that culture can be shared 
and that people can look like me.

2872
01:59:56,921 --> 01:59:57,754
I grew up learning taekwondo and and 
teaching classes in Korean because I 

2873
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:04,960
grew up,
that's what I spent my life doing and so

2874
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:06,970
that culture became a part of my 
culture.

2875
02:00:06,971 --> 02:00:09,550
It sounded go stealing it or culturally 
appropriate.

2876
02:00:09,551 --> 02:00:11,830
I was doing it honor and trying to do it
justice,

2877
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:13,173
but people have decided it's another new
way for someone to stand above them and 

2878
02:00:17,141 --> 02:00:20,140
take the moral high ground and try to 
control people's behavior.

2879
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,073
Yeah,
I would say this race is a social 

2880
02:00:22,641 --> 02:00:23,474
construct.
When you're only basis for an argument 

2881
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,940
is your race versus somebody else's 
race.

2882
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:31,460
You got to fucking shitty argument.
Do you know what I mean?

2883
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:32,713
When it becomes something about 
intention and we're talking about 

2884
02:00:35,241 --> 02:00:39,950
intentions and we're talking about like 
are you trying to take a culture?

2885
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:42,380
Are you trying to support it?
Fan of this culture,

2886
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:43,363
are you giving back to this culture?
Those are productive conversations like 

2887
02:00:46,701 --> 02:00:48,470
the one we had about rick bayless.
Look,

2888
02:00:48,471 --> 02:00:49,304
dude,
I'm not out here to try to slam dude's 

2889
02:00:50,181 --> 02:00:51,014
food.
Like I know a lot of people love his 

2890
02:00:52,071 --> 02:00:53,510
food,
so I'm not saying,

2891
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:54,740
oh,
I know this shit.

2892
02:00:54,741 --> 02:00:57,190
I don't know Mexican Pharma,
fucking Chinese guy dear.

2893
02:00:57,210 --> 02:00:59,900
I mean like my opinion about Mexican 
food doesn't matter.

2894
02:00:59,901 --> 02:01:01,160
Shouldn't matter,
you know,

2895
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,700
but my,
my opinion about some this appropriation

2896
02:01:04,701 --> 02:01:05,534
cooptation stuff is I wish people didn't
have to have a gatekeeper or a tour 

2897
02:01:12,681 --> 02:01:13,514
guide or somebody culturally similar for
them to try this food or go to this 

2898
02:01:18,081 --> 02:01:18,914
neighborhood.
I would love if people didn't have to 

2899
02:01:21,231 --> 02:01:22,064
have a,
she she dining room with like American 

2900
02:01:24,261 --> 02:01:29,261
style service or a white face or great 
article to try this Mexican food.

2901
02:01:29,751 --> 02:01:32,480
Like I wish they would just go to the 
neighborhood and go to the source.

2902
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:33,553
And then there's no problem with Rick 
bayless's food if we're all informed 

2903
02:01:36,591 --> 02:01:38,930
about it.
It just tough when he,

2904
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:39,920
the point of entry,

2905
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:41,263
well,
cultural appropriation to me is really 

2906
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:45,200
when you're pretending you're part of a 
culture,

2907
02:01:45,201 --> 02:01:46,034
like of a dude pretends he's native 
American and starts wearing feathers in 

2908
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:50,720
his hair and shit like that.
And like that's a nutty person.

2909
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,180
That's real.
That's legit.

2910
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,433
Yeah.
Well it's also real cultural 

2911
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:54,914
appropriation.
If you're wearing something that's 

2912
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:56,414
supposed to be sacred,
like there's certain articles of 

2913
02:01:57,861 --> 02:01:58,694
clothing and in some cultures are 
considered sacred and you're not 

2914
02:02:00,771 --> 02:02:02,360
supposed to be just walking around on 
them,

2915
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:03,291
like,
you know,

2916
02:02:03,291 --> 02:02:04,390
um,
what else?

2917
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,110
Things calls it a Bindi.
What are they?

2918
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:08,930
Indian people,
Hindu people wearing their forehead,

2919
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:10,093
you know the,
I mean that was like girls were wearing 

2920
02:02:11,211 --> 02:02:12,044
those things and,
but I think those are supposed to mean 

2921
02:02:13,341 --> 02:02:16,190
something in certain cultures are like,
and it Kinda,

2922
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:17,024
I get it kind of looks cool.
You want to wear it because it looks 

2923
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:18,860
cool.

2924
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,770
I get that.
Yeah.

2925
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:20,893
But things get sketchy when you're 
pretending to be a different culture or 

2926
02:02:23,331 --> 02:02:25,540
you're lying about where you're from or 
your a lot.

2927
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:29,900
And that's in my eyes,
more cultural appropriation or taking it

2928
02:02:29,901 --> 02:02:32,090
to give yourself an identity that is not
yours.

2929
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:34,370
Yeah.
See all that is those just dishonesty.

2930
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,640
It's like not a white dude wearing 
dreadlocks,

2931
02:02:37,641 --> 02:02:38,474
you know?
He's not pretending to not be white or 

2932
02:02:39,831 --> 02:02:44,831
like that Rachel Dolezal person that was
the NCAA NAACP person in spokane,

2933
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:49,010
Washington who turned out to actually be
white.

2934
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:50,660
Yeah.
That was the most insane.

2935
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,480
It was awesome.
And the funny thing is she,

2936
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:57,080
she actually likes doing a great 
tensions were like,

2937
02:02:57,150 --> 02:02:57,983
yeah,
well she really does love black culture 

2938
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:01,310
and black people and she was doing a 
great job,

2939
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:03,410
apparently are running the naacp up 
there.

2940
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:06,050
She was,
she was insane.

2941
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:07,950
Right.
She was totally insane for was it.

2942
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:09,500
But when I listened to her intentions,
I'm like,

2943
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:12,470
I don't think you're a bad person.
You just really confused.

2944
02:03:12,670 --> 02:03:15,260
This is like,
I don't know how you got to this place.

2945
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:17,810
I think some black dude Dichter and to 
delirium.

2946
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:19,280
That's why.
What happened?

2947
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:20,393
He just fucked her so good.
She was just running around with tweety 

2948
02:03:22,581 --> 02:03:24,980
birds flying around her head.
She had no idea what she was doing while

2949
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:27,020
she was doing it.
That's just my thought.

2950
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,340
She was a tough one.
Well,

2951
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:29,930
this crazy people out there,
there's,

2952
02:03:29,931 --> 02:03:32,390
and there's a broad spectrum of crazy 
activity.

2953
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:34,910
You know,
some of it that's logical and some of it

2954
02:03:34,911 --> 02:03:35,661
is not.
Some of it,

2955
02:03:35,661 --> 02:03:36,494
there's a little tiny white lies and 
some of it that's just pretending to be 

2956
02:03:39,411 --> 02:03:41,300
a different race,
you know?

2957
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,950
Yeah,
man,

2958
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,233
that's strange.
And in that strange shit is like what 

2959
02:03:48,501 --> 02:03:50,210
we're talking about before we can all 
learn.

2960
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:52,370
Like anybody that tells like little 
white lies,

2961
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:53,204
maybe they'll,
they'll watch Rachel Dolezal or someone 

2962
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:58,940
else who got busted in some gigantic 
cataclysmic lie and go,

2963
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:01,190
oh,
that's why you shouldn't lie.

2964
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:02,083
Oh that's why honesty and integrity are 
very important to people because we 

2965
02:04:05,661 --> 02:04:06,494
communicate through noises that we make 
with our face that's supposed to level 

2966
02:04:09,531 --> 02:04:10,364
out the intent of your mind.
What people also don't realize is a lot 

2967
02:04:13,221 --> 02:04:14,054
of the times they think that we're 
friends with them for the peripheral 

2968
02:04:16,881 --> 02:04:20,120
shit.
But I think most people like good people

2969
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:20,954
that you actually want to be a friends 
did not your friend because you have 

2970
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:26,690
dreadlocks.
Did Not your friend because you're aping

2971
02:04:26,691 --> 02:04:27,524
are you doing dear friend?
Cause they fucking like you and you 

2972
02:04:29,571 --> 02:04:32,000
don't have to pretend,
you don't got to pretend you don't gotta

2973
02:04:32,001 --> 02:04:32,834
fucking fake.
Just be who you are unless who you are 

2974
02:04:35,181 --> 02:04:37,370
socks and then he's probably potentially
to on it,

2975
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,580
then you got to work on it.

2976
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:39,660
No,
I just pretend to be black.

2977
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:40,933
I'm not doing a move.
Is Orange Spray Tan and dreadlocks and 

2978
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:45,450
no.
Yeah.

2979
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,433
Well honesty is always better.
And then if people don't like you will 

2980
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:49,614
figure out why they don't like you and 
improve upon whatever aspect of your 

2981
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:54,360
life that needs improving.
Don't pretend.

2982
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:55,373
It's like,
like here's a perfect example of 

2983
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:01,980
something that just never works.
Name dropping named droppings.

2984
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:03,630
Always gross.
It never works.

2985
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:07,530
But yet dummies still tried namedropping
there's a lot of people that still think

2986
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:08,513
they'd be,
you know we were over hanging out with 

2987
02:05:09,561 --> 02:05:11,220
the Tom,
Tom,

2988
02:05:11,390 --> 02:05:13,380
Dan last.
Tom Cruise had dan first.

2989
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:16,380
Oh Dan hour.
Yeah,

2990
02:05:16,381 --> 02:05:17,214
but that's different.
I brought him up first cause I was 

2991
02:05:18,901 --> 02:05:21,840
saying that he was going to be here when
I couldn't go to your shit.

2992
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,730
We brought up Shane Smith too,
but we're friends too.

2993
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:26,610
We're all friends.
We're all buddies.

2994
02:05:26,611 --> 02:05:27,730
That's different.
All you can't,

2995
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:30,000
you can't date name drop someone we're 
both friends with.

2996
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:30,780
That's true.
Yeah.

2997
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:31,890
That's different.
That's true.

2998
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:35,180
But to other people listening.
Oh new shit.

2999
02:05:37,290 --> 02:05:38,123
So cool.
The worst is when people name drop and 

3000
02:05:41,171 --> 02:05:43,830
they use saline one name.
You're supposed to know who it is.

3001
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:45,090
Yeah,
we're over Eddie's house.

3002
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,320
Who's Eddie?
Eddie Murphy.

3003
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,273
What you were just going to say Eddie 
and I was supposed to know or it's 

3004
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:51,234
somebody famous and they want to drop 
the name and they'll say the real name 

3005
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:55,320
and you're like,
shut the fuck up dude.

3006
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:57,530
Like for real name instead of like a 
it'll,

3007
02:05:58,170 --> 02:06:00,180
it'll be a rapper or a DJ and they'll 
use it.

3008
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,200
Yeah,
I was with,

3009
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:03,130
you know,
like I'm friends with a people.

3010
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:04,280
Oh,
I was at a lawns.

3011
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:06,960
I'm like a track fam.
It's whatever.

3012
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:09,270
Like I also know his real name.
Whatever you want to do,

3013
02:06:09,271 --> 02:06:11,340
man drop.
One of them dropped both of them.

3014
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,930
Yeah.
What his name dropping.

3015
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:13,860
How does it,
why does that,

3016
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:15,990
why do people still try to do that?

3017
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:19,050
I don't know if it's like a magic trick 
that just everybody knows.

3018
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:20,810
It's just terrible.
It's terrible.

3019
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:22,580
It doesn't terrible.
That's,

3020
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:23,983
it doesn't work.
It's like you're playing three card 

3021
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:27,090
Monte and you only got one card.
Like,

3022
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,950
listen bitch,
it's the same fucking card.

3023
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:31,350
You can't do it.
Can't play that game.

3024
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:33,270
That's super funny.
Shit.

3025
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:34,590
Alright.
Yeah,

3026
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,330
we'll just weird behaviors,
man.

3027
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:38,880
It's like we were talking about before,
we learned from each other.

3028
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:42,590
We learned from really great stuff and 
we learned from shit too.

3029
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:45,330
We learn from dumb shit.
I learned.

3030
02:06:45,331 --> 02:06:46,164
Yeah,
it's a fucking wise men learn more from 

3031
02:06:47,851 --> 02:06:49,470
fools thing.
Yes.

3032
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:51,880
I'm a man.
I'm a student of fools to,

3033
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:53,960
I'm in the youtube comments man.
Learn from these.

3034
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:54,963
Get in there dude.
Get in there with anonymous 69 two oh 

3035
02:06:57,661 --> 02:07:00,160
five up your ass.
Whatever their name is.

3036
02:07:00,161 --> 02:07:01,790
Still Mass University.
Mm.

3037
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:03,720
Well there's this,
there's definitely,

3038
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:06,300
I mean I'm joking around a lot about a 
youtube comments.

3039
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:08,010
There's actually some people that get 
involved in,

3040
02:07:08,011 --> 02:07:11,250
I mean I go to science pages and uh,
you look at the,

3041
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:12,653
there's some interesting youtube 
comments where people debate at the 

3042
02:07:14,911 --> 02:07:16,380
actual ramifications.
I'm sorry,

3043
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:19,200
I'm,
I'm fascinated by this planet nine thing

3044
02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:21,960
there.
They're trying to observe now cause this

3045
02:07:21,961 --> 02:07:25,560
is something I've been studying for a 
long time that uh,

3046
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:26,453
they'd been thinking it was,
there was very little evidence of it up 

3047
02:07:28,481 --> 02:07:29,314
until recently,
but that there was another planet 

3048
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:32,760
outside the Kuyper belt somewhere 
outside of Pluto.

3049
02:07:32,761 --> 02:07:35,290
It's one of the reasons why they 
declassified pluto was a planet,

3050
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,220
but now

3051
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:39,460
I'm there will almost positive.
And there's a planet out there.

3052
02:07:39,461 --> 02:07:40,510
They said,
I think that the,

3053
02:07:40,850 --> 02:07:41,683
the said within 99% certainty that 
there's a gigantic planet somewhere 

3054
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:50,320
around four to five times the size of 
the earth that is out way,

3055
02:07:50,321 --> 02:07:52,090
way,
way past Jupiter.

3056
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:56,500
And uh,
so I was going to a lot of these youtube

3057
02:07:56,530 --> 02:07:59,290
videos that we're describing it and then
reading the comments,

3058
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:00,124
the comments were fascinating.
So that's totally different sort of 

3059
02:08:01,961 --> 02:08:03,010
world.
You know,

3060
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:05,770
people are debating like the 
ramifications.

3061
02:08:05,771 --> 02:08:09,100
And then every now and then one of the 
Zacharias hitch and people would jump in

3062
02:08:09,101 --> 02:08:10,570
there and do you know,
Zacharias Itchiness?

3063
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:12,700
Zacharias itching was a guy who 
actually,

3064
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:15,730
ironically enough,
predicted this in the 70s,

3065
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:19,270
but he called it the 12th planet because
that's when they thought Pluto was still

3066
02:08:19,271 --> 02:08:20,104
a planet.
And then they thought the moon was a 

3067
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:23,020
planet.
I'm like,

3068
02:08:23,021 --> 02:08:24,830
this is all based on the Sumerian texts.

3069
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:27,950
This is all getting real convoluted now.
But Zacharias Hitchin,

3070
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:29,340
he,
um,

3071
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:31,930
is a biblical scholar.
He's dead now.

3072
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,033
But he wrote all these books about this 
culture from another planet called the 

3073
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:37,714
Annunaki,
and this is transcribing the ancient 

3074
02:08:40,391 --> 02:08:41,224
Sumerian texts.
The Sumerians were the oldest areas 

3075
02:08:43,940 --> 02:08:46,000
that's see that thing that he's holding 
up in front of him.

3076
02:08:46,090 --> 02:08:51,090
That is a piece of a Sumerian art that 
depicts these,

3077
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:52,234
uh,
it looks like some fucking transformer 

3078
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,190
shit.
Well,

3079
02:08:54,191 --> 02:08:54,970
it does,
right?

3080
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:57,280
Well,
what's interesting is you see that star,

3081
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:58,960
you see the star,
the sun,

3082
02:08:58,961 --> 02:09:01,150
with all the planets.
That is our solar systems,

3083
02:09:01,151 --> 02:09:05,380
not just our solar system that has all 
the planets and all the right sizes,

3084
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:07,960
which is kind of fucking crazy.
Wow.

3085
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,823
Yeah.
And this was 6,000 years ago when a lot 

3086
02:09:11,411 --> 02:09:12,970
of people didn't even think that the 
world,

3087
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,050
they thought the world was flat.

3088
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,093
Right?
But it also depicted this orbit is what 

3089
02:09:19,401 --> 02:09:20,234
would they believe is this?
One of the things that the Sumerian 

3090
02:09:21,731 --> 02:09:26,560
texts describe is this elliptical orbit 
of this planet called Nibiru.

3091
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:29,620
And this planet isn't the outside edge 
of our sources to mccombs,

3092
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:33,350
between Mars and Jupiter in there in 
the,

3093
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:36,430
this Zacharias hitching translation,
I think it was every 3000,

3094
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:41,050
600 something years and that this is 
where the Annunaki came from.

3095
02:09:41,051 --> 02:09:43,090
And then what they did is they came down
here,

3096
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:44,133
they studied some lower hominids,
they introduced their DNA into these 

3097
02:09:47,081 --> 02:09:47,914
lower hominids and made human beings.
And so he had predicted this planet 

3098
02:09:51,641 --> 02:09:54,370
being outside of our solar system for a 
long time.

3099
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,980
It's different lies there.
Yeah,

3100
02:09:56,981 --> 02:09:59,170
it is there the oil,
it's on this planet.

3101
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:00,950
The orbit is different.
The,

3102
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:02,003
the,
the size of the orbit is different 

3103
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:05,590
compared to what he described.

3104
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:07,420
No,
we don't even have a picture of it.

3105
02:10:07,421 --> 02:10:08,254
So we don't,
we definitely don't know what it looks 

3106
02:10:09,371 --> 02:10:10,960
like.
But the,

3107
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:11,794
um,
the Annunaki as described by Zacharias 

3108
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:19,950
Hitchen is the same thing as in the bib,
the Biblical term of the Elohim.

3109
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:22,900
Like there's also some different,
um,

3110
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,920
descriptions of these giants that came 
from somewhere else.

3111
02:10:26,921 --> 02:10:27,754
Like,
uh,

3112
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:28,381
those,
uh,

3113
02:10:28,381 --> 02:10:29,214
I think the description of what it means
is those from heaven to earth came and 

3114
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:33,943
idea is that there's advanced beings 
came down here and genetically 

3115
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:37,364
engineered human beings.
It's widely discredited by other 

3116
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:45,860
scholars of ancient Babylonian and 
Sumerian culture,

3117
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:50,340
but fun as shit to pretend and read and 
read and wonder,

3118
02:10:50,370 --> 02:10:51,201
well,
what if he's right,

3119
02:10:51,201 --> 02:10:52,070
man.
But see,

3120
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:53,630
when you do look at some of the stuff 
though,

3121
02:10:53,631 --> 02:10:54,051
you go,
okay,

3122
02:10:54,051 --> 02:10:56,570
well how did they know about the solar 
system?

3123
02:10:56,571 --> 02:10:58,310
How did they know about all those 
planets?

3124
02:10:58,670 --> 02:11:00,800
Not only that,
they had the caduceus,

3125
02:11:00,801 --> 02:11:01,550
you know,
the caduceus,

3126
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:05,900
the symbol for a medicine.
It's also the double helix of DNA.

3127
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:08,000
And that's what he believes that it 
represented.

3128
02:11:08,001 --> 02:11:08,834
He believes that the,
that that could do see a symbol that 

3129
02:11:11,181 --> 02:11:12,230
they had,
um,

3130
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:13,213
represents DNA and that that's what the,
what the ancient Samarian people were 

3131
02:11:18,291 --> 02:11:22,130
trying to describe when they carve these
things into clay tablets.

3132
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:27,340
They were trying to,
as best they could make some sort of a,

3133
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:29,090
uh,
a rational,

3134
02:11:29,091 --> 02:11:32,570
logical depiction of what they are being
told by these,

3135
02:11:32,571 --> 02:11:34,220
uh,
these ancient people.

3136
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:35,723
Damn.
So we might have already figured it out 

3137
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:41,240
once and then we're figuring out again 
or not.

3138
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:44,720
Or there's just a giant have decorations
that look like.

3139
02:11:44,721 --> 02:11:46,940
So there's,
there's the double helix,

3140
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:47,833
see,
look at you looking at the double helix 

3141
02:11:48,561 --> 02:11:51,860
of Dna and then you look at the caduceus
where this intertwined.

3142
02:11:51,890 --> 02:11:53,340
You see the top one with it.
Ghettos.

3143
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:54,493
If I was 6,000 years old man and I was 
going to design some shit with snakes 

3144
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:01,820
6,000 years ago,
it would kind of look like that.

3145
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:02,773
Well that,
but it does look like a double helix of 

3146
02:12:04,011 --> 02:12:05,540
DNA.
I mean it really is very,

3147
02:12:05,541 --> 02:12:07,820
very similar.
It looks like a guy was just like trying

3148
02:12:07,821 --> 02:12:10,340
to decorate with two snakes totally on 
the tango,

3149
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:14,090
but why does it represent medicine and 
why is it still represent medicine today

3150
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:15,013
that could do ceus.
That symbol still represents medicine 

3151
02:12:16,701 --> 02:12:17,534
today.
It's all when I'm having trump looks 

3152
02:12:19,490 --> 02:12:22,340
weird shit.
There's also some weird shit in terms of

3153
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:26,030
some of the imagery that they had of the
solar system.

3154
02:12:26,031 --> 02:12:26,864
One is one of the most talent because 
it's really bizarre that without a 

3155
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:33,740
telescope they were able to draw 
detailed image of the solar system.

3156
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:34,813
Like how the fuck did they do that?
How did they know that there was that 

3157
02:12:37,101 --> 02:12:37,934
many planets out there?
How were they able to differentiate 

3158
02:12:39,741 --> 02:12:40,574
between stars and planets?
How do they know the right number of 

3159
02:12:42,741 --> 02:12:43,574
planets?
Yeah.

3160
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:44,443
Not only that,
they also had a detailed depiction of 

3161
02:12:45,951 --> 02:12:48,260
the creation of the moon.
They have to,

3162
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:51,830
you know,
scientists and astronomers,

3163
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:52,933
they have earth one in earth to meaning 
that earth was a certain size and a 

3164
02:12:56,001 --> 02:12:59,120
certain shape in the beginning and then 
it was hit by another planet.

3165
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:00,423
Um,
that's also in the ancient Sumerian 

3166
02:13:02,031 --> 02:13:02,864
depiction of how the universe was 
created or how the solar system was 

3167
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:06,200
created.
They,

3168
02:13:06,201 --> 02:13:10,640
there's a planet called a Mar Duke and 
Tmr and uh,

3169
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:13,310
tmr collided with Mark Duke or something
like that.

3170
02:13:13,311 --> 02:13:14,144
I forget exactly what the,
but essentially it's earth one in earth 

3171
02:13:16,281 --> 02:13:17,114
too.
It's the same model that actual 

3172
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:23,870
astrologers astronomers use today when 
they're describing the earth.

3173
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:25,213
But he thinks these people from the 
other planet came here and created 

3174
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,520
humans.
He does.

3175
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:29,631
He thinks,
well,

3176
02:13:29,631 --> 02:13:30,920
he's dead.
He did.

3177
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:34,500
He believed that that's what the ancient
Sumerian texts was trying to describe.

3178
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:39,090
But there's a whole website called sitch
is wrong.com and Cichon is wrong.

3179
02:13:39,091 --> 02:13:43,560
Dot comes from other scholars who were 
tired of listening to all this,

3180
02:13:43,561 --> 02:13:46,260
what they felt was nonsense and they,
you know,

3181
02:13:46,261 --> 02:13:48,720
they,
they sort of laid out what they think is

3182
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:51,510
incorrect about his translations.
But at the end of the day,

3183
02:13:51,511 --> 02:13:52,344
put the translations aside and you look 
in at a 6,000 year old depiction of the 

3184
02:13:56,281 --> 02:13:57,510
solar system.
It's like,

3185
02:13:57,511 --> 02:13:59,490
what the fuck is that?
Not only that,

3186
02:13:59,491 --> 02:14:03,540
there's these also depictions of these 
enormous people with these little monkey

3187
02:14:03,541 --> 02:14:04,374
people sitting in their lap and this was
what he believed was describing the 

3188
02:14:07,921 --> 02:14:08,754
Annunaki,
these genetic alterations of monkeys of 

3189
02:14:11,341 --> 02:14:12,174
taking these lower hominids,
introducing their superior advanced DNA 

3190
02:14:16,201 --> 02:14:19,650
into these monkeys and creating 
something that's very different.

3191
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:24,660
Doodoodoo too.
I know we would do it.

3192
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:27,660
I'll tell you that for fuck shore,
right?

3193
02:14:27,661 --> 02:14:29,880
If we found another planet,
there was a bunch of dumb monkeys on.

3194
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:35,100
He did a detailed like audit of the 
planet and found no higher animals.

3195
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:37,890
Nothing that had a computer,
we would drop our seeds.

3196
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:40,830
I mean,
we'll probably already looking for those

3197
02:14:40,831 --> 02:14:42,150
places to just,
yeah,

3198
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:44,100
for sure.
At the very least,

3199
02:14:44,101 --> 02:14:46,380
I won't fuck one of those things like 
Avatar.

3200
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:47,483
Right.
That was like one of the most realistic 

3201
02:14:48,991 --> 02:14:51,660
things about Avatar that that dude 
wanted to fuck one of those blue people.

3202
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:53,790
I would be scared to put my dick in a 
blue person.

3203
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:55,010
Yeah.
You never know what's going on in there.

3204
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:56,010
I don't know,
man.

3205
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:56,873
That's fucking,
that shit probably burns through 

3206
02:14:57,891 --> 02:15:00,240
condoms.
Especially if they leunig blue people.

3207
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:01,860
There's so much bigger than us.
Yeah,

3208
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:03,180
and like,
you know,

3209
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:06,600
especially when you look at the mating 
habits of things that we know on earth.

3210
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:11,840
What does this 36 foot five dog and 
skeleton so that away,

3211
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:16,020
what are you going above top secret dot 
cops foot tall blue person.

3212
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:17,220
Well,
if you do,

3213
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:19,340
you're going to need some help.
You got,

3214
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:22,290
you're not going to do it alone.
36 foot tall.

3215
02:15:22,291 --> 02:15:24,990
That shit is so not real.
Well,

3216
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:27,570
it says it's fun.
Most of it,

3217
02:15:27,571 --> 02:15:29,190
it's fun.
But if you look at that,

3218
02:15:29,191 --> 02:15:30,990
uh,
that image that you had pulled up before

3219
02:15:30,991 --> 02:15:31,824
Jamie,
there's an image of one of those 

3220
02:15:32,581 --> 02:15:35,100
Annunaki having a person having a 
little,

3221
02:15:35,101 --> 02:15:40,080
a monkey like person sitting in their 
lap sign on this page is before when you

3222
02:15:40,081 --> 02:15:42,180
had a look at some of those other 
images,

3223
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:46,050
there's a,
these ones where these guys,

3224
02:15:46,051 --> 02:15:46,884
these enormous looking characters have 
these little tiny monkey people with 

3225
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:53,700
thumbs and their feet and they're 
sitting on this guy's lap,

3226
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,130
death thumbs on the feet and the 
drawing.

3227
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,601
Yeah,
they're,

3228
02:15:56,601 --> 02:16:00,270
they're smaller and they have thumbs on 
their lap and according to the text,

3229
02:16:00,271 --> 02:16:01,104
this guy described it.
The text is very confusing too because 

3230
02:16:03,541 --> 02:16:06,130
it's something called cuneiform and 
cuneiform.

3231
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:07,043
It's like if you ever been in an old 
building that has like those old school 

3232
02:16:09,421 --> 02:16:10,254
nails,
do you know what those old school nails 

3233
02:16:11,761 --> 02:16:13,020
look like?
Like in the turn of the century,

3234
02:16:13,021 --> 02:16:13,854
they were like a flat top,
but it was almost like a wedge and 

3235
02:16:15,931 --> 02:16:17,280
that's what nails looked like.
Oh,

3236
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:18,990
that's how they,
that was their writing.

3237
02:16:18,991 --> 02:16:20,550
That's not that Jamie,
but that's,

3238
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:22,460
that's one of them.
That's similar though.

3239
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:23,303
But this is a Gypson.
You're looking at something that's 

3240
02:16:24,451 --> 02:16:27,810
Egyptian.
Um,

3241
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,950
but the Annunaki one,
uh,

3242
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,933
you had had it from just,
if you go back to that window that you 

3243
02:16:32,771 --> 02:16:33,604
had before,
go back to that window that you had 

3244
02:16:34,871 --> 02:16:37,510
before that had the depiction of the 
solar system on that one.

3245
02:16:37,511 --> 02:16:38,201
Okay.
Yeah,

3246
02:16:38,201 --> 02:16:41,350
because when you would win whatever 
search that you use for that,

3247
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:42,723
there was one of them that had one of 
those home boys had one of them sitting 

3248
02:16:45,581 --> 02:16:46,900
on his lap.
All right up there.

3249
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:49,210
Right up there at the top.
You'll see right there.

3250
02:16:49,211 --> 02:16:50,140
Bam.
See that?

3251
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:52,120
Oh,
look at that.

3252
02:16:52,121 --> 02:16:53,500
The thumb foot.
Yeah.

3253
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:55,173
It's,
there's a few of these that have a 

3254
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:01,990
little weird that people think are 
depictions of things with tails.

3255
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:04,180
It's very strange stuff,
man.

3256
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:06,370
It's very strange.
At the very least,

3257
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:09,100
they had an advanced knowledge,
like a Tele Toby.

3258
02:17:09,130 --> 02:17:11,980
The one he's holding up Kinda looks like
a teletubby.

3259
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,903
Well,
it doesn't look like a monkey in that 

3260
02:17:13,481 --> 02:17:14,810
picture,
but in some of them they have,

3261
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:18,520
they actually look like they have tails 
and got the fuck boy not haircut too.

3262
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:19,743
There's all sorts,
there's all sorts of weird stuff 

3263
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:22,234
involved in it.
Their knowledge of the solar system was 

3264
02:17:23,891 --> 02:17:27,400
one of the most disturbing things 
because you're talking about 6,000 years

3265
02:17:27,401 --> 02:17:28,234
ago.
Like how did they know about all those 

3266
02:17:29,381 --> 02:17:31,570
planets?
How did they know that they were,

3267
02:17:31,630 --> 02:17:32,071
uh,
they,

3268
02:17:32,071 --> 02:17:33,670
they,
they knew the right orbit.

3269
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:35,043
You know,
they knew that Jupiter was like far 

3270
02:17:36,431 --> 02:17:39,310
larger than Mars.
They had more smaller than earth.

3271
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,200
They had like all the orbits.
Correct.

3272
02:17:41,201 --> 02:17:43,500
It was a really strange stuff.
It,

3273
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,870
it's too good to be a coincidence.
But then I'm like,

3274
02:17:46,871 --> 02:17:49,760
I dunno if I believe the whole Shebang,
you know,

3275
02:17:50,050 --> 02:17:51,760
almost always the whole Shebang is 
wrong,

3276
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:54,460
but it would be awesome if somebody just
showed up on this planet.

3277
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:56,620
Like optimus prime one day was like,
Hey,

3278
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,100
I created you guys.
We've been over here.

3279
02:18:00,101 --> 02:18:00,934
Like,
Oh,

3280
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:03,490
I've been wondering where you guys were.

3281
02:18:03,550 --> 02:18:05,320
What'd you think that that would be fun 
though.

3282
02:18:05,321 --> 02:18:06,154
It would be awesome.
Isn't it better to be at the top of the 

3283
02:18:08,261 --> 02:18:09,094
food chain then?
Could we waiting for galactic overlords 

3284
02:18:11,231 --> 02:18:13,720
to tell us how much we suck?
It would just be,

3285
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:14,583
it would.
It would be just awesome if somebody 

3286
02:18:15,431 --> 02:18:16,870
showed up like,
this is what life's about.

3287
02:18:16,871 --> 02:18:19,750
This which is supposed to do at a year.
Fucking ideas are terrible.

3288
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:20,913
I'm pleased fucking do this.
It would be devastating to the self 

3289
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:24,364
esteem of people living on earth.
I'll tell you that because it would 

3290
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:30,760
realize we'd be like very lord of the 
flies asked like we were a bunch of kids

3291
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:33,700
left alone to our own devices and then 
when the adults showed up,

3292
02:18:33,701 --> 02:18:35,800
they're like,
what the fuck are you doing here?

3293
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:37,283
You realized everybody was just acting 
like a psychopath because they have no 

3294
02:18:41,051 --> 02:18:42,040
one to look over them.

3295
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:45,040
It would be cool though if if that,
if I've been doing it all wrong,

3296
02:18:45,041 --> 02:18:47,110
I kind of want to know what the hell 
we're supposed to do,

3297
02:18:47,170 --> 02:18:48,760
what we're definitely doing it all 
wrong,

3298
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:51,160
but I think we're supposed to figure it 
out on her own.

3299
02:18:51,161 --> 02:18:51,820
I mean,
look,

3300
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:53,560
if we've got Ted Cruz,
Donald Trump,

3301
02:18:53,561 --> 02:18:54,394
Hillary Clinton,
and Bernie Sanders is their only hopes 

3302
02:18:56,230 --> 02:18:59,320
to be the commander in chief for the 
greatest army the world's ever known for

3303
02:18:59,321 --> 02:19:00,850
fuck.
Sure we doing to now.

3304
02:19:01,210 --> 02:19:03,640
We're 100% doing it wrong.
This is,

3305
02:19:03,641 --> 02:19:08,641
these are not the great scholars and the
great intellectuals that we need to help

3306
02:19:09,671 --> 02:19:11,590
run this world.
There's no one amongst them.

3307
02:19:11,591 --> 02:19:13,570
That has like a,
a brilliant philosophy.

3308
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:16,480
Even when you're looking at,
you're looking at Bernie and Hillary and

3309
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:17,760
Bernie,
as much as I love him,

3310
02:19:17,790 --> 02:19:21,070
as much as I love some of his ideas,
you see that guy and Hillary and they're

3311
02:19:21,071 --> 02:19:24,550
bickering back and forth on during these
debates.

3312
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:28,250
That's so unbecoming of someone who's to
be the president.

3313
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,210
The leader.
Yeah.

3314
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:30,073
Yeah.
Especially a dude who's in his sixties 

3315
02:19:31,401 --> 02:19:32,800
and some lady you,
you know,

3316
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:36,050
she covers everything except the very 
top of her neck.

3317
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,210
I mean,
it's bizarre.

3318
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:41,930
It's bizarre.
Like you're supposed to be further along

3319
02:19:41,931 --> 02:19:44,570
in this crazy journey than us.
If you want to be.

3320
02:19:44,571 --> 02:19:45,404
The president used to be so far ahead 
that you have some lessons that you can 

3321
02:19:48,321 --> 02:19:49,154
impart upon the rest of us.
You have some ideas about how we can 

3322
02:19:51,441 --> 02:19:55,430
improve our policies.
You have some ideas on what laws that we

3323
02:19:55,431 --> 02:19:56,264
can establish that would probably better
to protect us from greed and from evil 

3324
02:20:00,021 --> 02:20:00,854
corporations and from people that are 
raping the world of all its natural 

3325
02:20:03,021 --> 02:20:04,490
resources.
All those ideas.

3326
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:06,590
Well,
the thing is to really smart people,

3327
02:20:06,610 --> 02:20:09,500
do they have other ways to control and 
fucking rule the planet?

3328
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:10,401
You know,
like,

3329
02:20:10,401 --> 02:20:12,950
I don't think the president is actually 
the most powerful person.

3330
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,630
You go on Illuminati on me,
right?

3331
02:20:14,631 --> 02:20:15,590
Number?
I think so.

3332
02:20:15,650 --> 02:20:18,080
Do you believe in the Illuminati 
Illuminati?

3333
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:18,914
But I just think that,
I mean if for some of these people that 

3334
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:23,390
what I like Michael,
like Bloomberg,

3335
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:24,253
why would bloomberg one,
Bloomberg can already fucking close 

3336
02:20:25,851 --> 02:20:28,760
shots from where he's at.
He has more money than fucking anybody.

3337
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:31,970
Well,
maybe he feels like the system is broken

3338
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:32,804
and he's in a potential,
he's in a situation to give his life 

3339
02:20:35,241 --> 02:20:38,300
meaning and maybe enhance the lives of 
other people by helping.

3340
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:41,210
I don't know cause I don't know him.
I'm not even familiar with him,

3341
02:20:41,390 --> 02:20:43,490
but I'm just playing devil's advocate.
Yeah,

3342
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,890
I have advocate would say that that,
I mean,

3343
02:20:45,891 --> 02:20:47,930
if you have all that money and you have 
all that freedom,

3344
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:50,480
why when you try to make the world a 
little bit of a better place.

3345
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:52,040
Yeah,
I agree.

3346
02:20:52,041 --> 02:20:54,350
But I think that they can do it in a 
different way.

3347
02:20:54,351 --> 02:20:55,184
I mean,
look,

3348
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:56,540
the Koch brothers,
I mean,

3349
02:20:56,570 --> 02:21:01,040
they're using their means to mold the 
world the way they see it.

3350
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:03,230
I think the people who really have 
power,

3351
02:21:03,231 --> 02:21:06,140
they're like looking at the presence.
Like that guy's a puppet,

3352
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:07,250
you know?
Well,

3353
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:10,370
it's definitely been shown to be a 
puppet more than once.

3354
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:11,473
More than one different administration 
has been shown to be completely at the 

3355
02:21:14,241 --> 02:21:16,640
influence of the people that got them in
the office in the first place.

3356
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,230
Yeah.
That's all disappointing,

3357
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:19,153
you know?
And that would all be wiped out of the 

3358
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:23,390
Annunaki showed up at a gigantic gold 
disc came out,

3359
02:21:23,391 --> 02:21:27,870
levitating telling us how stupid we are.
We need the Annunaki to come from,

3360
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:30,740
but we're going to be that someday.
That's my thought.

3361
02:21:30,741 --> 02:21:31,530
Captain.
Save a hoe.

3362
02:21:31,530 --> 02:21:34,100
Save these.
That's well,

3363
02:21:34,101 --> 02:21:35,420
yeah,
they would totally be captain.

3364
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:37,220
Save a hoe.
The rest of the other islands where like

3365
02:21:37,221 --> 02:21:38,410
pitch,
what are you doing here?

3366
02:21:38,430 --> 02:21:41,410
Get the fuck off earth.
You're going to earth these head,

3367
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:44,240
this planet of the heroin addicts.
Have you not watch TV,

3368
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:46,850
have you not gone on earth and look at 
the youtube comments.

3369
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,980
They're fucking savages.
Get out of there man.

3370
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:52,370
They're going to eat you and fuck you.
Lucky and not necessarily in that order.

3371
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:56,900
They're going to come on your tits,
Bro.

3372
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:58,400
Dude,
run.

3373
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:01,220
They're going to come and your grandma's
Ted's get out.

3374
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:02,113
Get out of that planet.
If someone could be the first person to 

3375
02:22:03,871 --> 02:22:05,210
fucking on and Aki,
you know,

3376
02:22:05,211 --> 02:22:07,070
think that would,
that would be a contest.

3377
02:22:07,071 --> 02:22:07,904
That'd be a radios.
Contests like morning zoos between 

3378
02:22:09,621 --> 02:22:12,150
humans and our Nike's.
It's not a human fucking nine o'clock.

3379
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:14,000
It would be the Annunaki fucking the 
human.

3380
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:17,240
You say that.
But what if it's is through a walmart,

3381
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:18,133
clever,
crafty person and an on and Aki that's 

3382
02:22:20,991 --> 02:22:24,380
been getting $30,000 a year and really 
doesn't have any motivation.

3383
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:25,543
And their weak.
I think even the shittiest out of knock 

3384
02:22:27,131 --> 02:22:30,810
is going to fuck a human through a wall.
I used say that that brick wall,

3385
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:34,110
you see that,
but take one of the dumbest people today

3386
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:35,093
and put them in a room with one of the 
smartest people from ancient Rome and 

3387
02:22:39,091 --> 02:22:42,180
who would be running shit,
smartest dude information Rome.

3388
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:42,990
Yeah,
right.

3389
02:22:42,990 --> 02:22:43,823
Yeah.
Well don't you think that'd be the case 

3390
02:22:44,761 --> 02:22:48,150
as far as like a advanced intelligence,
like if you get a really dump,

3391
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:50,910
I mean unless they figured out a way to 
eliminate stupidity,

3392
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:52,553
which it seems like you're always going 
to have conflict and resolution that 

3393
02:22:55,441 --> 02:22:57,300
seems like what the universe is supposed
to be all about.

3394
02:22:57,440 --> 02:22:58,273
The universities all be all is about 
problems and solutions for those 

3395
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:01,494
problems and that's how things advance 
and that's what the universe of of 

3396
02:23:04,771 --> 02:23:05,604
thought is in this world.
It's always constant conflict and 

3397
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:09,653
resolution of that conflict and and 
trying to figure out how to never have 

3398
02:23:12,841 --> 02:23:13,674
this conflict again and what's the best 
way to get even natural disasters and 

3399
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:18,450
all these things.
There are opportunities to innovate,

3400
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,010
are opportunities to figure out a way.
Okay,

3401
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:20,993
we saw what happened in Fukushima,
how do we get power and not have this 

3402
02:23:23,431 --> 02:23:24,264
problem and what do we do,
and then all these minds converge and 

3403
02:23:26,511 --> 02:23:27,810
they try to figure out solutions.

3404
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:29,730
I think that's just always going to be 
the case.

3405
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:30,740
I think that's always good.
That's,

3406
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:35,580
that's what causes things to improve is 
this constant battle.

3407
02:23:35,581 --> 02:23:38,790
If everything was groovy and perfect,
nothing would get done.

3408
02:23:38,830 --> 02:23:39,663
Yeah.
It seems like you're always has to have 

3409
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:40,951
struggle.
Yeah.

3410
02:23:40,951 --> 02:23:42,990
There's a dilemma that always has to be 
addressed,

3411
02:23:43,050 --> 02:23:45,360
which is still,
it gives you his dope.

3412
02:23:45,810 --> 02:23:47,040
We end on that.
Yeah.

3413
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:49,440
It sounds fucking dope.
It's good.

3414
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:51,630
Tell everybody about your show.
Where can they get it?

3415
02:23:51,631 --> 02:23:53,520
When can they get it and tell everybody 
about your book.

3416
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:57,150
April 28th viceland Wong's world comes 
out.

3417
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:59,670
You can't get to Jamaica episode.
It's going to be incredible.

3418
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:00,533
The book,
they'll be a couple of May 31st I went 

3419
02:24:02,701 --> 02:24:06,030
back to China when my brothers brought a
white woman with me.

3420
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,980
Oh,
sorry.

3421
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:11,980
Shit Credible Eddie and you could follow
Eddie on twitter.

3422
02:24:13,470 --> 02:24:15,930
It's Mister Eddie Wong and on instagram 
it's the same.

3423
02:24:15,931 --> 02:24:17,550
Right?
Mr Eddie Wong.

3424
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:18,990
Thanks for having me,
my brother.

3425
02:24:18,991 --> 02:24:21,530
Anytime that's club in the world.
Oh my friends.

3426
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:22,513
Even on auto rocky planet.
I'm sure it's better than any 

3427
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:26,390
unoccupied.
I think they might have a speed.

3428
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:27,703
All right.
We'll see you guys on Friday and I'll 

3429
02:24:29,491 --> 02:24:32,460
see you guys tomorrow night for 20 in 
seattle.

3430
02:24:32,490 --> 02:24:36,880
Two shows that the more theater,
how do you think.
