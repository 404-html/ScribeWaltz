1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,450
She got to tell these fucking people,
Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,870
There's a lot of people that don't even 
know this podcast is happening right 

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:09,870
now.
This is a disaster.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,480
I will right now tweet it as I'm 
talking.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,940
That's how slick I am.
Not very slick at all.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,110
Just bear with me.
This is gonna.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,580
Be clunky.
They're going to be like,

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,580
I thought this was a good podcast.
Here we go.

9
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,710
Bitches.
Let's see.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,700
Here we go.
Retweet it.

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,590
Please do.
Let me know.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
That's called being lazy too.
I'll let y'all do all the work that can 

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:30,680
hashtagging and then I'll just retweet 
it.

14
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,830
Um,
I do a lot of retweet until it's too 

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,031
much work.
When people ask you to just tweet 

16
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:38,031
things,
hey,

17
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:38,031
tweet this for me,
bitch.

18
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:38,760
You're not even treating yourself like 
Brian Callan.

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,260
That motherfucker will tell you,
hey,

20
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,040
tweet that.
I'm here.

21
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,640
Tweet that I'm here.

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,460
And then you go to his twitter page.
You,

23
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,600
I had to do this wrestling class.
And there was a guy that navigator.

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,650
I had to see this episode of the Joe 
Rogan experience podcast is brought to 

25
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,990
you by squarespace.com.
Squarespace.com

26
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,580
is a website that allows you to build 
websites very easily.

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,790
It's a.
it's set up so that like a dummy like 

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,870
you or I could easily make.
Notice how I said you were.

29
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,930
I thought I was going to say me.
I'm tricky.

30
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,130
It's A.
Essentially it's set up so that a simple

31
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:22,131
person like myself could easily make a 
website and you can do it really 

32
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:22,840
quickly.
Choose from over 20 bad ass designs.

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,490
You can if you need help,
they have 24 slash seven super fast 

34
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,840
email support.
You also can start it and try it without

35
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,580
paying for it.
You don't even have to enter your credit

36
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,581
card information just to have so much 
confidence that it's a cool website for 

37
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,791
creating websites that they allow you to
play with it first and then if you 

38
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,340
decide like,
wow,

39
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,770
this,
this website that I made super easy,

40
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,850
it's fucking bad ass.

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,290
You can easily register it and you can 
easily start an online store.

42
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,620
So it's.
It's a pretty sweet account and if you 

43
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,810
use the codename Rogan,
oh no,

44
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,660
don't even use the code named Joe and 
the number eight.

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,870
There's 20 of these codes,
a squarespace.com,

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
squarespace.com,
and use the offer code Joe and then the 

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,510
number eight,
so if you decided to purchase a,

48
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:11,511
you get a 10 percent off and the number 
eight is because it's the month of 

49
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:11,511
August,
so it's all one word.

50
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:16,370
They're really tricky like that.
They want to know like exactly what 

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
month people tuned in and got a 
squarespace.com

52
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,960
account,
but it's a bad ass website.

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,550
You'll enjoy it.
Go check it out.

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,040
We're also brought to you by 
audible.com.

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,560
If you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,340
you can get one free audio book and 33 
days of honorable service audible,

57
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:37,281
which also has opie and Anthony,
which is why I became deeply acquainted 

58
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,460
with my little buddy Jimmy Norton and 
his book.

59
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,350
Best of Jim Norton and volume two.
Oh,

60
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,600
that's not a book I got to pile audio.
It's audio.

61
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,570
Put that together.
I guess fans did or something.

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,090
I Dunno.

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah.
Well opie and Anthony,

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,610
you know,
all the shows are on audible,

65
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,250
so I like that.
That's the coolest thing ever said.

66
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,840
Like if you missed yesterday's show,
you just go online and download the show

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,050
and I think they touched,
took all the best parts of a Jimmy on 

68
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,050
opie and anthony.
This is volume two.

69
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,920
So there's a few of them and uh,
it says an hour and 10 minutes.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,640
And you said one of your books is 
available,

71
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,980
right?
Yeah.

72
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Happy ending.
And I did the voice read for an audio 

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,020
book.
I didn't do it for,

74
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,360
I hate your guts.
How come you didn't do no time?

75
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,590
No.
I wish I had,

76
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:18,230
but because when I did the happy endings
one,

77
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,920
it was such an annoying process to go 
through because they like,

78
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,420
she's like say it like this and say it 
like that.

79
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,250
And I listened to her but I'm like,
I'm a comic.

80
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:30,251
I know how to talk.
I should have just done when she's 

81
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,251
telling you how to do it,
how to read it.

82
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,060
So it's clear like,
and they do that with everybody,

83
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,530
but it's like I should have overrode or 
on a fuel it.

84
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,020
No,
I know how to do that.

85
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,240
Yeah,
you can have that kind of impact.

86
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,890
You're not going to put out a bad 
product.

87
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,070
I know you when you're trying to do the 
best thing that you can do it.

88
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,310
You can't do that.
When people were trying to change your 

89
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,310
annunciations or micromanage.
Yeah.

90
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,340
That becomes a problem.
I,

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
I had a book deal and I gave back the 
money because of that video.

92
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
Yeah.
I didn't want to deal with it.

93
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,350
They were,
they were trying to get me to write it 

94
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,881
like a stand up and stand up for him and
we kind of had such a gap between what 

95
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:04,730
they wanted and what I wanted to do was 
so wide that I was like,

96
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,600
I don't think it's fair because I can't.
I can't make your book what dummies they

97
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:09,350
are.
Well,

98
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,780
they have an idea of what they think 
could sell.

99
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:15,980
They actually wanted me to try to do my 
standup in book form and I was like,

100
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:16,940
there's no way I would do that.

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,940
And they go,
but George Carlin did it and Jerry 

102
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Seinfeld did it.
I'm like,

103
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:21,940
that's great,
and those guys are great comics.

104
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,940
I said,
I don't care.

105
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:23,680
I don't.
I'm not gonna.

106
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,070
Do that.
I'm never going to do that.

107
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,660
I'm never going to put my fucking stand 
stand,

108
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,130
stand up,
stand up for a reason.

109
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,230
It's supposed to be that way and it's 
cheating in a way.

110
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:32,210
It's just cheating.
Instead of coming up with a new book.

111
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:37,211
You just taking.
That's lazy thinking by publishers are 

112
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:37,211
copy editors.
Well it was just gross.

113
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:42,131
I think they just trying to make money 
and it led me think that they were just 

114
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,311
trying to make the most money possible.
They weren't really worried about it 

115
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:45,311
being good.
Otherwise you would never propose that.

116
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,470
So it was just,
we just had a different idea of what to 

117
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,201
do.
So I understand where you're coming 

118
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:53,201
from,
but you know,

119
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:53,201
hey,
they're in the business of making money.

120
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,790
You know,
they're not in the business of being Jim

121
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:55,990
Norton.
Yeah.

122
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,410
You know,
that's the problem.

123
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,770
No one to fucking tell you mean.
Think about all the crazy shit you've 

124
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,861
ever said and how many people could,
would suggest that that would be a good 

125
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,010
thing to talk about.
Meanwhile,

126
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,910
it's made you who you who you are.
They're idiots.

127
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,820
So Joey and his book is I usually $23 
and ninety three cents,

128
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,560
but if you sign up right now,
you get this book

129
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,610
for free.
Good googly Mowgli.

130
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,370
Go check it out.
Go to audible.com

131
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,820
and a audible.com/joe.
And.

132
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,640
Or did they change that now?
Didn't they change that?

133
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,510
This is the hall ridiculous that it has 
to be with squarespace.

134
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:36,511
Squarespace changed.
I think automotive is still basically 

135
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:36,511
the same thing.
Yeah,

136
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:36,760
they all should be the same thing.
But uh,

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,390
the point

138
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,410
Kim,
that you,

139
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,270
you'd go to a lot of massage parlors.
Have you heard of Roadmaps Dotcom yet?

140
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,350
No.
It's going to be your new favorite 

141
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,350
website.
You can be addicted to it.

142
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,900
It's pretty much yelp for massage 
parlor.

143
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,290
Go there and realize that Brian got 
jerked up by the Gal right before you.

144
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Oh yeah.
But it has like reviews and like if you 

145
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,430
want a hand job and went full sex,
you want whatever.

146
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,950
And it tells you all the places around 
here,

147
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,660
man.
Yeah,

148
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:01,350
it's great.
Great.

149
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,990
Nice views.
Yeah,

150
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,150
be great if that was all legal and we 
can just be like gentlemen and discuss 

151
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,150
this.

152
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,650
Oh that would be wonderful.
She's an Asian but she has bad breath,

153
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:12,120
but she will eat your ass for an extra 
30,

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,590
slightly bruised.

155
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,780
But meanwhile we're like,
why would you do that?

shit?

163
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,410

what was that Wayne's room I just 
started bringing,

167
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,160
not a dust.
Not Off.

168
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,110
I haven't even tried that years.
Not

169
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,050
any out of nowhere.
Uh,

170
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,630
if you haven't been to [inaudible] dot 
com.

171
00:06:56,631 --> 00:07:00,410
So I'll last sponsor.
We sell what we call things.

172
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,440
It's what we call it,
human performance website.

173
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,710
Everything we sell on it is in some way 
going to benefit you physically or 

174
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,050
mentally or your,
your,

175
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,000
your cardio or your,
your mental health.

176
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,080
There's a a bunch of different strength 
and conditioning exercise,

177
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:23,081
equipment pieces that we sell.
We sell kettle bells and battle ropes 

178
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:23,660
and weight vests and steel maces and 
club bells.

179
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,020
All Shit that really promotes functional
strength,

180
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,000
strength that you could apply to 
athletics,

181
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,150
whether it's martial arts or a sport or 
something along those lines.

182
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,650
And then the supplements we,
we,

183
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,550
we sell is essentially the best shit 
that we can find in every category.

184
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,880
What's the,
where's the best protein powder that's 

185
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:42,880
made out of hemp?
What's,

186
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,670
where's the best a spirulina.

187
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,670
Where's the Best Melatonin?
We just sell the best shit we can get 

188
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,820
and we try to sell it at a reasonable 
rate and we sell it through the 

189
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,581
Internet.
So the whole thing is done easily and 

190
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:57,491
smoothly.
We don't have to deal with any third 

191
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:57,830
party and if you're interested in these 
supplements,

192
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,270
which are the most controversial thing 
that we sell,

193
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,810
you know people like what caused it 
helps your endurance,

194
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:07,811
what it makes you brainwork what it's a 
lot of people don't want to believe 

195
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:10,631
things.
So we have a science thing set up at 

196
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:10,820
[inaudible] dot com,
explains the science behind all this and

197
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,640
then on top of that there's also a 30 
pill,

199
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:18,820
product.
You say,

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,330
hey,

201
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,310

shit that I use shit.

203
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,310
That arbor used shit that my friends 
use.

204
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,010
Alpha brain is what's called a 
nootropic.

205
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Nootropics are his nutrients that are 
have been shown in certain studies to 

206
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,350
enhance certain aspects of cognitive 
function.

207
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,650
Whether it's being able to problem solve
or memory or there's other supplements 

208
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:49,460
like new mood,
which is a five htp supplement,

209
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,760
which is great for your serotonin 
development and also has l trip to fan 

210
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,620
which converts to five htp.

211
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,280
I'm talking too much.
Any of these questions you need answered

212
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,760

supplements.

215
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,960
My Pal Jimmy Norton is here.
Cue The music.

216
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:14,961
Brian,
let's get frisky first year experience.

217
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,270
That's the most magical intro we've ever
given.

218
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:36,271
You still?
I feel like there's some energy in the 

219
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:36,271
air and I said that it's going on my 
brother.

220
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,540
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

221
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,630
I'm okay.
I'm drinking this coffee and it's very 

222
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,601
good with the butter in it,
but I know that I'm going to be any of 

223
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,820
that stuff like lactose just fucks me up
so I know him a lot.

224
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,460
Yeah,
I'm done.

225
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,560
I'll be interested to see if it has the 
same effect on you because it's grass 

226
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:53,560
fed butter.

227
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,970
Wonder if that has the same effect.
You know what I find,

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,770
I find that I could be lactose 
intolerant,

229
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,340
but when I drink raw milk,
I don't have any problem which the grass

230
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:03,040
fed butter effect.
Well the idea is,

231
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,410
and obviously I'm no doctor so don't 
listen to me,

232
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,650
but the idea is that butter from grass 
fed cows is butter from healthier cows 

233
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,750
and cows are not designed to eat corn 
and when they eat corn it's one of the 

234
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,400
reasons why they get so fucking fat,
right?

235
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,310
It's just not a part of their normal 
diet,

236
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,290
their normal diet.
It's just grass.

237
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,620
And when you have grass fed beef it's a 
much leaner beef tastes different and 

238
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,091
the idea is the butters different too 
and the butter is actually healthy for 

239
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:30,820
you as opposed to the butter that you're
getting.

240
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,620
That's from corn fed cows.
The other thing is the homogenization 

241
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,870
and pasteurization of milk changes so 
much about how your body absorbs it,

242
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,080
like the enzymes in it and everything 
you ever had.

243
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,340
Like raw milk.
I don't know.

244
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:51,341
I don't love milk.
I drink it out of necessity and other 

245
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:51,341
shit.
But like,

246
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:54,581
I can never be the professional just 
walking around lugging milk at how bad 

247
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,390
his breath must be.
Drink fucking milk.

248
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,660
That was supposed to be like the sign 
that you're a serious man.

249
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:02,540
Did you ever see the movie,
the Hustler a give me with Paul Newman?

250
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,080
Yes.
Yeah,

251
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:08,081
sure.
Do you remember the Jackie gleason's 

252
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:08,150
backer was George C dot Scott and George
C dot Scott.

253
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:12,080
Played Burt and Bert Gordon and he drank
a glass of milk everywhere.

254
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,380
Everybody else,
everybody's getting fucked up left and 

255
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,480
right.
They're all drinking whiskey and they're

256
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:20,960
all fucking bar just over there drinking
a glass of milk.

257
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,600
He's serious as serious gambler.
Oh Wow.

258
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,590
No,
I never saw that.

259
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,510
I remember the movie.
I don't remember that part of it.

260
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,600
I guess it was like,
I want to say 63.

261
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,280
Yeah.
I want to say it was 1963.

262
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,200
That's a great fucking movie.
The Guy,

263
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,060
the guy fat changed his name because of 
that.

264
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,470
Minnesota statues.
Gleason.

265
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:40,310
What was the real,
the original fashion wander.

266
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,880
Own Rudolph Rudolph wander own.
I think that's his real name.

267
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,160
Yeah,
I think it's Rudolph wander own.

268
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,510
Um,
he,

269
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:52,511
uh,
he was not even the best pool player of 

270
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:52,940
his era,
not even close Moscone was,

271
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,990
and they used to have these,
these matches and Moscow and he hated 

272
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,550
the fact that people only knew him 
because he played Minnesota fats because

273
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,640
Minnesota fats stole the name off the 
movie.

274
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,280
It was a brilliant move.
He said that was based on me.

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,160
He was a really eccentric character.
Minnesota fats.

276
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,540
It wasn't,
he was a bad pool player.

277
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,760
He was a really good pool player,
but he was a hustler.

278
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,830
Right.
And he,

279
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,060
he had like 100 cats.

280
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,180
He was one of those guys,
he used to go to Kentucky Fried Chicken 

281
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,540
and he picked up like two buckets of 
chicken and he would just tossed them in

282
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,470
his yard and like 100 cats would come in
and tear the chicken apart.

283
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,720
Like that's what he did every day.
That was his thing.

284
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,540
Yeah.
And like a gang of stray animals that he

285
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,640
fed.
So he was an interesting guy,

286
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,600
but he wasn't.
The character wasn't based on on him,

287
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,990
the character in most likely it was just
a base and a bunch of different pool 

288
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,340
players.
What's fiction added to it?

289
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,130
My priest years ago when I was in North 
Brunswick,

290
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,870
his name is father miserables.
He's dead now,

291
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,690
but his brother was a very famous steve 
miserable,

292
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,180
right?
Yeah.

293
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Yeah.
That was showing off for his cousin 

294
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,220
though.
I just don't remember what it was.

295
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,190
Yeah,
he was the guy that did those 

296
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,190
commercials on Miller lite,
I think,

297
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,190
right?

298
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,340
Yeah.
Every now and then a guy like sneaks 

299
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,310
through and becomes famous through a 
sport where no one else is famous.

300
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,260
Like in pool.
Everybody says,

301
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,300
Jeanette Lee,
do you and do you know who he is?

302
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,950
Now if you tell someone that you play 
pool,

303
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,210
people go,
do you know who genetically is?

304
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,450
She's this really beautiful woman who 
was also.

305
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,880
She was a pool champion.
She doesn't play,

306
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,440
I don't think as much anymore,
but she was on espn a lot.

307
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,210
She might be back into it,
I don't know,

308
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:30,211
but she's beautiful and she plays really
pool and she wears all black and her 

309
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:33,220
nickname is the black widow and she's 
Korean so she's got this dark black hair

310
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,570
and she's pretty and so people go nuts 
for.

311
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,620
So she's like the Lance Armstrong and I 
don't mean this about performance 

312
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,040
enhancement.
I mean by Lance Armstrong cancer,

313
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,750
either one with Lance Armstrong is the 
only bike guy I've ever heard of.

314
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,530
Like I guess Greg Lamont,
he,

315
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,980
he was one that I had heard of like way 
back in the past.

316
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,620
But as far as like being able to name 
professional cycles,

317
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,660
I can after Lance Armstrong and no one 
cares about any of them.

318
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,250
If you talk about like professional pool
players almost everybody goes,

319
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,540
oh,
what about the black widow?

320
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,790
Like that woman.
I seen her but I don't know.

321
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,350
I bet you have.
She's in,

322
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,150
she's in commercials too.
I'm sure she just,

323
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,170
she does a lot like.
But she's been the most successful at 

324
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,210
utilizing her image and like,
and becoming famous and a sport where 

325
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,770
almost no one's famous like it's for 
Popeyes is tough time.

326
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,230
There's no this,
it's very hard to make a living.

327
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,270
It's very hard to become famous and 
there's a hard to express the 

328
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,980
personality there or something that 
differentiates you and makes you likable

329
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,750
that Oh,
it is bigger than the sport.

330
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,220
Like maybe she has that.
Maybe there's some hot dude.

331
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,470
She's hot and she plays pool.
That's what it is,

332
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,470
you know.
And she's very savvy as far as marketing

333
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,710
rather wide backed girl,
big girl with her.

334
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,240
Ellen,
that celebrity poker thing.

335
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,250
I didn't get actually get to play with 
her.

336
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:45,610
Um,
I've,

337
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,430
I've played in a tournament and she was 
the commentator,

338
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,410
which was kind of crazy.
She's commentating on me playing pool,

339
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
you know,
world class professional.

340
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,110
But luckily I was playing against people
that didn't have any idea what they were

341
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:59,000
doing.
I liked pool and hated.

342
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:03,380
I don't find it relaxing at all to me 
because I stink at it and I suck at long

343
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,760
green shots.
Like,

344
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:05,450
uh,
I'm just,

345
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:10,451
I'm fairly hideous at Paul and I never 
found it enjoyable because I just can't 

346
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:10,451
get the hang of it.
Tools,

347
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,800
one of those things.
It gets enjoyable when you get really 

348
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:14,800
good.
Yeah.

349
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,620
As you get really good,
then it becomes like really satisfying 

350
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,370
if you can get into a groove and run out
racks and you get in good position.

351
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,610
So satisfying that cocky walk around the
table and I've never taken.

352
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:28,030
I just fucking shamefully go from point 
a to point B and hope I don't scratch 

353
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,030
like a cunt.

354
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,640
The worst is playing in a bar.
Oh,

355
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,640
a bunch of people crowded around a table
and drinking and bumping into shit.

356
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:42,641
And it's what a ridiculous idea of 
precision game in a bar with a bunch of 

357
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,890
drunks stumbling into tables and then 
darts.

358
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,891
There's another fucking genius idea.
Let's take a bunch of people that are 

359
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:53,480
hammered and give him pointed metal 
things to throw at each other.

360
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,890
Help.
They don't cross the line.

361
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:59,891
It really is a darling.
There's nothing worse than a dart 

362
00:15:59,891 --> 00:15:59,891
league.
Especially.

363
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,880
They fight.
They'll fight over a guy's fucking foot 

364
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:02,900
crossing the line.
They'll actually go to blows.

365
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,700
I don't find it enjoyable.
I played dark.

366
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,860
Even if I got them all on the red button
and be like,

367
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,570
who gives a fuck?
Terrible.

368
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,810
I don't enjoy darts.
Do you think if you've tried to pick a 

369
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:13,810
fight with a dark guy,
did they draw on each other?

370
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,400
They pull their darts out,
take three paces or whatever and throw 

371
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,180
them at each other.
I was at in a fight a nine to five.

372
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:25,181
I was at a bar that there was a fight 
and somebody took a datsun and stabbed 

373
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:25,181
the guy in the back.

374
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,950
They probably never fight each other for
that reason.

375
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,450
They're all holding darts.
It's like a fucking really.

376
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,750
The store in Texas,
everybody's got a gun.

377
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,340
You don't do it.
Yeah.

378
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,320
That's an interesting way of looking at 
it.

379
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,830
You never hear about to dark players 
going out and throwing darts at each 

380
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:41,830
other.
You know what I mean?

381
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,610
Like they're really experts at tossing 
weapons.

382
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,900
We had darts,
a fucking weapon.

383
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,760
Now you know,
if it was poison,

384
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,770
you're fucked man.
How are you going to stop a dirt from a 

385
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,491
dark expert guy?
Was the only thing is they take their 

386
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:54,491
time,
those fucks,

387
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:58,121
don't you hate when they line.
I hate when they got their foot there 

388
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:58,121
and they got the eye thing and the arms 
going back and forth and you're like,

389
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:59,540
oh,
just fucking kill yourself.

390
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,690
What is the stupid fucking.
If you really stop and think about it,

391
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,140
I mean it's fun to play.
Don't get me wrong,

392
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:11,141
but what a stupid skill.
So throw something and make it stick 

393
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:11,990
into a wall.
It's something spot.

394
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Something that counted years ago we 
hunted for food or like on game of 

395
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,521
thrones.
That's a great skill to have to be able 

396
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:21,521
to shoot something accurately at a 
target,

397
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:22,820
but now it just doesn't mean anything 
anymore.

398
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:28,330
Unless you're hunting,
you're going like squirrel hunting with 

399
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:28,330
a bow and arrow.
Yeah.

400
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,490
You have to have a really good aim.
Yeah.

401
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,400
If you're doing something like that was 
a dark.

402
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,910
Could you go like bird hunting with a 
dark loosening up to these 

403
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:36,910
motherfuckers?
No Way.

404
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,090
Low dark would see he'd blow Darwin 
where.

405
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Yeah.
I watched the special with these dudes 

406
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100
were Jack and monkeys with blow darts.

407
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,790
It was really crazy to watch man.
Watching people kill monkeys is very 

408
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,260
strange.
I mean it's so.

409
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:52,530
It feels so close to murder.
It's weird.

410
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,400
You know,
you're like,

411
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,750
man,
a monkey.

412
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:59,751
You're killing monkeys.
Like those things are really close to 

413
00:17:59,751 --> 00:17:59,810
people.
Man.

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,490
Shooting Darts at his thing and these 
monkeys.

415
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,710
There was a Carrari I think that was the
name of the poison.

416
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,140
There was some sort of a is if my back 
or some shit.

417
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,300
Usually frogs.
Motherfuckers,

418
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,860
man.
Yeah.

419
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,030
Well the dues in the Amazon,
they find out everything that kills you 

420
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,381
and they take note.
If you ever want to put something on a 

421
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:21,470
spear tip,
that fucking thing will kill you because

422
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,480
they ate it once somebody they know 
eight at wanting to drop dead and like 

423
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,030
make a note.
She had somebody.

424
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,950
I mean that's the only way they knew.
Yeah.

425
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,840
When you're dealing with like the 
Amazon.

426
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Do you ever see that?
The documentary about the guy who swam 

427
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,050
through the Amazon,
he swam the length of the Amazon River?

428
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,730
No.
Yeah.

429
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,020
Yeah.
God Damn it.

430
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,300
It's a.
it's a really fascinating.

431
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,790
Let me find God.
Guy Swims.

432
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Amazon,
how many miles with the Amazon 

433
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:51,620
documentary?
A long fucking time.

434
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,900
He got fucked up.
Big River Man.

435
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,090
Yeah,
bits called big river man.

436
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,040
The guy is fucking crazy.
I mean he's crazy.

437
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,220
He drinks beer every night and he gets 
in this water and swims for days and he 

438
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,180
doesn't even look like he's in the 
greatest shape in the world,

439
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,270
but the guy just can go and go and go.
But he's ingesting all this fucking 

440
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:19,371
water and like this parasite written 
place and he gets all fucked up from it.

441
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:20,880
I mean he's really,
really,

442
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,250
really sick and he keeps going.
He keeps going.

443
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,320
Keeps fucking swimming this thing.
I mean,

444
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,510
what,
what he did was pretty fucking 

445
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,391
incredible because he was just like a 
regular guy who drank beer who decided 

446
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:32,391
to make this happen.

447
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,770
Like I don't think,
you know,

448
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,110
I mean he's,
he would look,

449
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,530
he didn't like you see the way he's 
built his building.

450
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,050
I mean it's a sturdy looking fella,
but he's just not built like a guy who's

451
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:46,290
going to swim the fucking lengthen the 
Amazon a couple of years ago.

452
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,600
So I can't remember all the details 
about it,

453
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,780
but I remember thinking like what a 
crazy character this guy is.

454
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,870
He's been like a fire in the twenties.
It would have had to have had that 

455
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,030
barrel chest that you knew that they 
would fucking problems,

456
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,980
but they weren't ripped and cut guys are
today.

457
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,840
Well there's a lot of guys today that 
are like that.

458
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,360
You know,
looking guy like Mike Russell,

459
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,680
he's a world class heavyweight in the 
UFC.

460
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,680
He's knocked out todd Duffy.
He's a big fucking guy,

461
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,620
so Chicago cop,
but he's built like that,

462
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,300
you know,
it's built like a regular guy.

463
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,340
Some people just have a higher level of 
fat is just genetically.

464
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,160
There's nothing you can do about that 
dude who wants to be punched in the face

465
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:24,510
by a Chicago cop fighter.
Pleasant.

466
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,900
He's a nice guy too.
They all are that.

467
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,770
The guys are the nicest athletes I've 
met.

468
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:33,771
That's why I love it so much.
Every one of them has been a cool guy 

469
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,420
that I've met and interviewed and never 
had they been next to us.

470
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,460
Well,
they have a much healthier attitude.

471
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,380
I think that the,
the accolades,

472
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:45,381
and this is not hating on anybody,
but I think the accolades that a 

473
00:20:45,381 --> 00:20:47,260
professional athlete gets almost 
unhealthy sometimes.

474
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:47,860
Yeah.
Yeah,

475
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,600
and I think that they're not getting the
humiliation that fighters get by losing,

476
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,100
by training in the gym,
by,

477
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,700
by getting broken in the gym,
by getting submitted,

478
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,820
by getting tagged.
There's like a certain level of reality 

479
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,121
that fighters live in where they don't.
They don't have to engage on this chest 

480
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:10,651
puffing that you see a lot of people 
doing almost a compensated because it's 

481
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:14,641
almost like they don't.
They can't even believe that through 

482
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,111
this fucking superstar.
So part of their brain is like 

483
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,771
sabotaging a course in it,
causing them to act like cons and not 

484
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:23,370
tip anywhere and slammed doors on people
and the kind of shit in here from like 

485
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,170
really arrogant pro athletes.
But with MMA fighters for the most part,

486
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,470
these are dudes that if you,
if you're serious about that sport,

487
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,100
you have to have like a spartan 
discipline.

488
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,960
I mean,
you have to be the type of person that's

489
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:39,961
watching your diet,
making sure you're organizing your 

490
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:42,871
training and you just get humiliated.
You get humiliated and humbled is a 

491
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:47,251
better word.
You get humbled by the whole process of 

492
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,340
trying to become great and of just 
different athletes know,

493
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,410
you see like some,
some pro basketball players that are 

494
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:54,410
like super arrogant or,
or crazy.

495
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:59,281
It's like you don't see nearly,
you're always gonna see it a certain 

496
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:02,941
amount and the population of people,
but you don't see nearly as much in mma 

497
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:03,850
or in the UFC as you would think.

498
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,880
I haven't met that many NBA people that 
I liked.

499
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,970
Um,
to be honest,

500
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,980
the one I thought was really nice.
Clyde frazier we had on it was great.

501
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,300
Uh,
Dr Jay was really nice,

502
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,970
but I think he's lost a lot of the 
money.

503
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Um,
but fucking I met Lebron James wants 

504
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,190
briefly and he wasn't awful,
but I only got a photo with them.

505
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:25,610
This is what,
uh,

506
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,000
what,
uh,

507
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,210
this is fairly humiliating.
I wanted a picture with him at the 

508
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,821
comedy cellar.
So I texted Kevin Hart because they're 

509
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:33,821
good friends.
I'm like,

510
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:34,580
I want to get a picture with Lebron.
So he texted Lebron,

511
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,120
took my friend's going to be asking you 
for a picture.

512
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,200
So that's the only reason he stopped was
because I texted Kevin Hart.

513
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,610
Oh,
well that's a good deal though.

514
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:41,860
That's a good connection.
Yeah,

515
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,861
it is.
To text my friend who does movies and 

516
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:46,861
see what he can get me a picture of the 
fucking NBA player.

517
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:51,310
Bad favor to call it.
People don't know you like in pictures 

518
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,431
with celebrities.
You have like more pictures with 

519
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:54,431
celebrities in any other celebrity.
I do have a lot of them.

520
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:54,950
Yeah,
and I'm glad I do it.

521
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,460
I,
it's,

522
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,280
it's fun to do.
Although the ones I wished I had,

523
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,550
I got autographs,
but I met kinison wants and didn't get a

524
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:03,710
photo and prior I met once and didn't 
get a photo,

525
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,870
but I didn't do photos back then.
Yeah,

526
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:07,760
there's a few people that I wish that 
I'd taken.

527
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,650
I wish I'd taken a photo with Hicks.
I think that would have been crying.

528
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,610
I never got to meet him.
It was more like a high,

529
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,600
you know,
I never,

530
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,270
I never got to talk to her,
but I got to see him perform a couple of

531
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,130
times when I was an open mic or fa.

532
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,660
If cameras were around back then back 
then it was like really rare.

533
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:26,960
You had a camera on you,
but if cameras around like back then.

534
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,600
Oh,
what a great picture that be.

535
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah.
I never met pillocks.

536
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,460
No ma'am.
I've never listened to her stuff.

537
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,780
Like I've heard cliffs,
we played.

538
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:37,781
I know and a,
I've never listened to a hick cd and 

539
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:38,000
everyone tells me how great he was,
but it's like at this point in my life,

540
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,320
I just don't want to hear another 
comment can be influenced by him.

541
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,650
Like just.
I hear he's great and good.

542
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,940
Good for him and I don't want to know 
that.

543
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:44,760
That's interesting.
Yeah.

544
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,980
You know,
I've had this

545
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,710
conversation before.
We have a different opinion on,

546
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,750
on that.
I hear Ya.

547
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,150
That can can happen,
but I got it.

548
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:58,151
I like getting inspired and I think for 
me the best way to get inspired is by 

549
00:23:58,151 --> 00:23:59,270
just listening to comedy.
You know,

550
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,440
I,
I didn't get inspired.

551
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,530
It makes me want to write,
you know,

552
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:07,531
and I think I just,
I don't feel like there's any sense in 

553
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,460
avoiding a certain amount of influence 
that we're going to give each other,

554
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,180
but I also think if your mind is 
straight and your,

555
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:16,610
you're good ethics as far as like your 
writing,

556
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,380
I don't think you really have to worry 
about that.

557
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,490
You know,
what you're doing.

558
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,520
You're trying to pursue your ideas.
You're not trying to pursue somebody 

559
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,030
else's.
I think it's a good thing to worry about

560
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,680
when you first starting out,
but I don't think a year years stop.

561
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,350
I don't.
There's no way.

562
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,950
You're very ethical,
you know,

563
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,500
and I respect your take on this opinion,
like the reason why you're doing it.

564
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,750
You're doing it for the exact right 
reasons.

565
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,390
I just always feel like,
uh,

566
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,580
I got into comedy because I love the art
form itself and I'm a fan of it and I 

567
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,530
don't want to not be a fan of it.
I just,

568
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,910
just because I'm doing it,
it doesn't mean I want to still enjoy it

569
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,550
as if I had nothing to do with it.
If I was never involved,

570
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,100
you know,
if I went on it became a comic book 

571
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,071
artist or whatever else I wanted to be 
or it could have been if I wasn't a 

572
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:04,001
comic.
I would like to think that I would like 

573
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:04,001
comedy just as much.
Yeah,

574
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:04,001
you know,
it's funny.

575
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,810
I see like I went into a collins one man
show about the constitution.

576
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,070
How was that?
I heard a great thing.

577
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,530
It's amazing.
And Colin Quinn and where is it?

578
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,320
It's,
it's in New York,

579
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,840
but I think he's moving theaters like 
the Cherry Lane theater,

580
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:18,040
but he might be moving and it's a whole.
I think it's better than his last one,

581
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:21,040
which I thought was brilliant,
but this one is totally.

582
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,310
It's like stand up,
but it's all about the constitution and 

583
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,970
it's fucking.
That's inspiring to see like,

584
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,140
because he never takes the easy road.
Like I buy a column because he never 

585
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,680
goes for the easy Dick joke or the cheap
angle.

586
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:39,280
Like he fucking toughs it out and if 
he's bombing on stage at the cellar,

587
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:42,610
he takes it like a man and he works it 
out and he makes it funny,

588
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,470
like he's really,
really,

589
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:46,120
uh,
just above everybody I think.

590
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:49,630
And this is,
I put him at the top above all comics to

591
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,900
do an hour on the constitution.
I could do maybe three minutes and I 

592
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,530
would immediately go,
I wonder how big Jefferson's thick would

593
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,470
lapse right into the fucking slave 
fucking.

594
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,360
But okay,
I'm going to stop you right there.

595
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,070
I think

596
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,040
there's anything wrong with that.
I think what you do,

597
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,980
and I love Khan,
I think Colin is hilarious,

598
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,830
but honestly I'd rather see you.
Thank you.

599
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,950
The reason being is because you're a 
fucked up dude and you're going to say 

600
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,230
some fucked up shit and it's going to be
fun.

601
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:18,330
It's going to be,
you're going to say some nutty shit.

602
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,500
Colon talking about the constitution 
would be fascinating and I think I enjoy

603
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:24,120
that.
I completely different level,

604
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,140
but for sheer laughs,
if I'm wanting to just goof on shit,

605
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,500
I would like to see an act like yours.
Thank you,

606
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,480
because because you're having fun,
you know,

607
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,540
and uh,
I think I'm having a show on the 

608
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,300
constitution is,
is very,

609
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:44,301
very difficult,
but it's also very difficult to do a 

610
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:44,301
show the way you're it.
It's

611
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:49,040
really hard to do what you do.
That's why there's so very few people 

612
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,071
who are as honest as you warm when 
you're onstage as open about your 

613
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:55,500
perversions and as lovable in,
that's like very difficult to do.

614
00:26:55,501 --> 00:27:00,501
Like you shouldn't sell that short.
Like what you do is just as much of an 

615
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:00,740
art form as what Colin does.
And I would,

616
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,870
I love to see both of them,
don't get me wrong,

617
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,130
but you can't say like,
I,

618
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:09,630
I enjoy that style of comedy and it's 
fucking hard to do.

619
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,660
That's why there's only like at all the 
really good dirty comics in this 

620
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,960
country,
how many of them are there really?

621
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Or even a dozen.
Is there even a dozen that you would go 

622
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,230
out of your way to see at a $300,
million people?

623
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,850
Is there even a dozen really perverted,
dirty guys that you would go say,

624
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,010
no,
no,

625
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,870
it's a fucking.

626
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,900
It's a very difficult thing to cultivate
to get to that point.

627
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,640
You know,
it's,

628
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,670
it's weird.
It's like I don't mind doing dirty 

629
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:41,670
stuff,
like if I'm being truthful,

630
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,680
I just don't like doing it when I know,
like prior said that he said 

631
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,381
motherfucker or nigger too much at times
as a crutch and he knew when he was 

632
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:49,920
doing it,
like I don't want to do it as a crutch.

633
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:52,020
I don't want to like use it as priors.
Motherfucker,

634
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,500
if I'm doing it because I want to do it,
I'm cool with it.

635
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,900
I'll be as filthy as you want to fucking
tranny jokes.

636
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:02,901
I'll talk about being shit on whatever,
but if I'm doing it because I fuck,

637
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,560
I don't have anything.
Right.

638
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,780
And you know what I mean?
It's like then I feel like I'm doing the

639
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:09,710
equivalent of a fart sound and it's like
I wish I didn't sell myself.

640
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,210
That is the big leap that you make as a 
comic when you get past just doing stuff

641
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:19,890
that works to doing stuff that you 
believe in that and it works because you

642
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,480
believe in it.
It's not like a trick.

643
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,360
It's not like just a feeling that you 
get.

644
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,100
When I remember doing material that was 
dirty when I was first starting out,

645
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:34,101
like one of the things that I would 
remember is how awkward it was when I 

646
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:38,931
was forcing it when I was like bombing 
and I was trying to make like it was 

647
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:38,940
funny.
It wasn't funny.

648
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:43,941
It was just bullshit.
When you're dirty especially it's like 

649
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:43,941
extra awkward.
Oh,

650
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:48,461
it's like a giant echo in the room 
because you finished with con and you're

651
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,750
like so disappointed in yourself back 
then.

652
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,870
I was like always disappointed in myself
that I could never go clean.

653
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,110
So that guy was like,
I could probably have a career.

654
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,230
I thought I could do well as a clean 
comic,

655
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,180
but for whatever reason I just wouldn't 
do it.

656
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,580
I just didn't.
I was like,

657
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,210
ah,
why can't you just be clean?

658
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,760
So when I would bomb if I bombed dirty 
or be like,

659
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,660
Oh God,
yeah,

660
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,180
I'm strict.
Humiliating.

661
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:14,400
Yeah,
it was clean.

662
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,700
But you know what?
I find that there's.

663
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,970
I don't find any extra valor and 
cleanliness.

664
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:19,500
I mean,
it's a good thing to do if you're really

665
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:20,220
funny,
clean,

666
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,490
but I think that they both have,
they're both equally acceptable if 

667
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:25,500
they're,
if they're original and funny.

668
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,510
Like I agree with guys that stink and 
I'm like,

669
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,010
I don't give a shit.
I hate cute euphemisms and uh,

670
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,940
you know,
then she was giving me a kiss on Mike.

671
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,590
Man Under TV.
You can't say cocker,

672
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:45,591
I get that right?
But when you're trying to cute it up at 

673
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:45,591
a nightclub,
it makes me,

674
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:48,100
it physically makes me ill.
I'm embarrassed for comments.

675
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:50,980
That dude right there be an embarrassing
person to talk to.

676
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Could you imagine how many conversation 
with a person like that and you're 

677
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,100
sitting down and having a conversation 
with the person that is just just goofy 

678
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:03,790
and Dorky and you don't want to talk to 
a person who doesn't swear.

679
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,340
No.
Can't tell you like one on one.

680
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,760
Tell me what happened.
So,

681
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,210
and then she's talking to my cock and I 
can't believe it's happening.

682
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,170
Yeah.
Tell that.

683
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,850
Say that.
Say that if that happened.

684
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,940
So I know you.
So I get to know you because if you 

685
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,060
don't,
if you exclude anything weird or twisted

686
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,530
about yourself,
I've never gonna really,

687
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:21,010
you know,
you.

688
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,270
Yeah.
You know,

689
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,580
that's hard.
It's hard for people to do.

690
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,670
People don't like to include that and I 
understand that I'm in a job and you're 

691
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,701
in.
We're in a job where it's a little 

692
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:33,040
easier for us because almost most things
are acceptable in our business.

693
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:38,041
Like as a comedian,
it's hard as an accountant to walk in 

694
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,981
and go,
I fucking went out with this girl and 

695
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:41,320
she's blowing me and I realized she had 
a dick but I was high and I let her,

696
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,050
like,
you can't walk into an accounting office

697
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,300
and tell anybody that.
But if you say that as a comic,

698
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:47,080
everybody's like,
all right,

699
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:47,950
so uh,
how is the Gig?

700
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:50,110
And we don't care.
We're hard to shock.

701
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,960
But that you could come to a room full 
of comics,

702
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,050
a writer's room and tell that story.
And instantly everybody would be 

703
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,050
laughing.

704
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,050
Yeah.
They don't care.

705
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,120
We were harder to surprise and we accept
a lot more and we can speak our mind a 

706
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,520
lot more,
but uh,

707
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,550
you know,
there's a line where we know that goes 

708
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,120
beyond that where people are just being 
unnecessarily adorable and not revealing

709
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:12,420
and I hate them for it.
I really.

710
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,030
Yeah,
no,

711
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:14,040
I know what you're saying.
They're,

712
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:14,770
they're,
they're,

713
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,560
they're putting on an act either that or
they're a crazy person.

714
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,620
I think that putting on an act and not 
to say everybody has to be a speaking 

715
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,350
racially insensitive language would be 
this way,

716
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,060
but to judge it like they don't get it.
Like Wiener,

717
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,840
I don't care what the guy does,
but for people,

718
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:33,841
for men to act like I can't comprehend 
taking a picture of my cock and course 

719
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:38,840
you can.
We all understand why he does what he 

720
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:38,840
does know.

721
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,980
A lot of guys will do it.
A lot of guys don't cheat but to,

722
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,000
to act appalled that he wants to get a 
dick.

723
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,930
So people were enjoying claiming the 
moral high ground,

724
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,190
you know,
they,

725
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:53,191
they love to.
I think that's going to happen in the 

726
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:53,191
future.
Less and less,

727
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,260
I think as the technology becomes more 
intertwined in our lives,

728
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:00,490
there's going to be less and less 
privacy.

729
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,950
There's going to be less and less of 
grandstanding or there's going to be 

730
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,231
people that do it and get caught like 
wiener or Eliot Spitzer is perfect 

731
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:12,871
example.
He was a guy who was the mayor of New 

732
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:15,840
York or the governor of New York and was
arresting prostitution rings but was 

733
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,540
also using them like.
It's like one of the craziest ideas ever

734
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,720
and so when you get caught,
nobody's going to feel bad.

735
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,490
Like,
what are you doing man?

736
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,370
Like you,
you,

737
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:27,750
you didn't just use a prostitute,
you know,

738
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,330
you were arresting them.
You were like shutting down prostitution

739
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:33,250
rings and then you were using 
prostitutes.

740
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,120
Like he can't do that.
Yeah.

741
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,120
It's really,
it's the equivalent of your agent double

742
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,070
dipping that it's immoral on every level

743
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,110
and it's crazy.
It's crazy.

744
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:47,111
It's crazy to arrest him in the first 
place for getting paid to do something 

745
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:48,590
that's perfectly legal to do free.
If they just fucked.

746
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,330
If they just had a website that say,
hey,

747
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:53,270
let's meet up and fuck.
No one would have a problem with that,

748
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,940
but yeah,
because some money's being exchanged.

749
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,430
What does it really?
Is it a tax issue?

750
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,460
It just then say that's what it is and 
let's figure out how to tax it.

751
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:06,690
Morals.
I think it's their idea of what the 

752
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:06,690
morals are.
Ridiculous.

753
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,521
As soon as it's free,
as soon as it's free and you can do it 

754
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,180
and there's no problem whatsoever,
but if you charge money for it,

755
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
then all of a sudden it's a.
it's a crime.

756
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,950
That's ridiculous because if somebody 
just wanted to fuck if some crazy woman 

757
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,380
just wanting to go around town,
Hey,

758
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,400
meet me here,
let's fuck,

759
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,290
and then 10:00
I'm going to meet another guy.

760
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:21,890
I'm gonna.
Fuck him.

761
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,720
No one can say a Goddamn word.
Right?

762
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,350
But because money's being exchanged,
all the sudden she's a criminal.

763
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
It's terrible.
And I believe I'm a big fan of 

764
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:32,580
legalizing prostitution.
Well,

765
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,390
it should be legal.
It should.

766
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:36,350
It shouldn't be mandatory,
but it should be legal.

767
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,940
You should be able to do whatever you 
want to do.

768
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,970
It'd be safer.
It was illegal and I think a lot of our 

769
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:42,970
ideas about it,
look,

770
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,090
obviously I don't want my daughters to 
be prostitutes,

771
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,210
don't get me wrong,
but I think a lot of our ideas of what's

772
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:52,211
so horrible about prostitution is all 
based on this puritanism bullshit that 

773
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,740
we've been pushing this country from the
Gecko.

774
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,920
It's nothing wrong with being nice.
There's nothing wrong with having 

775
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,680
morals,
but when you push your own bullshit on 

776
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,620
other people and arrest them for giving 
hand jobs,

777
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,000
you know,
can you imagine?

778
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,270
You can rub your feet,
you could rub my feet to the cows,

779
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:11,030
come home,
you could rub my ass cheeks.

780
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:16,090
That's all good.
But it feels too good when he rubbed my 

781
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:16,090
deck.
So don't do that.

782
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:16,090
Put you in a cage.

783
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,370
You just have to have food involved.
Pretty much like you have to give him a 

784
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:20,370
sandwich first and like,
look,

785
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,640
I gave you food.
Let's go back to my place.

786
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,670
What's the difference between a date 
and,

787
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:27,100
and you know you're spending $100 on a 
date or $100.

788
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,670
Just hair didn't have the money.

789
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,450
It's the,
your,

790
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,370
your,
your.

791
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,520
Although you're spending money,
you're spending money to try to show the

792
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,920
woman that you are a generous person,
you want to take care of her,

793
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:41,921
and then the sex is a mutual thing.
The idea is just that the men should be 

794
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:45,260
paying for the woman because they're not
worth as much,

795
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,230
which I agree with what?
I agree.

796
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,490
Yeah.
Look,

797
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,060
it's way easy for a girl yet laid.
That is for a guy just so you got to pay

798
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,490
for dinner as seems like they have the 
upper hand.

799
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,690
Socially.
It's pretty obvious.

800
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:57,420
Exactly.
And paper,

801
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,440
fucking dinner buddy walks in with a 
pussy on this leg and even then you 

802
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,740
gotta fucking smell your buddy's brad 
neck.

803
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,170
Yeah,
you're fucking working all over your 

804
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:11,750
carpet.
Your buddies squirt.

805
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Not Hot at all.
You know if your girls squirts all of 

806
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,160
your,
your,

807
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,340
your couch doesn't bother you.
Throw a towel down.

808
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:23,270
If I came over into and while I was 
fucking your leg,

809
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,930
clear blitz.
What of genetic engineering leads to 

810
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,551
that dude?
Just start putting vaginas on their 

811
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:33,551
elbows.
Bang each other's forearms.

812
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:35,990
I mean,
that's gonna be someone's going to offer

813
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,340
that option.
If option becomes available,

814
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,590
someone's going to be the guy who gets a
vagina on his thigh.

815
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,880
Absolutely.
It's going to happen.

816
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:46,881
Yeah.
And his friend will fuck it at a party 

817
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:47,310
and all of a sudden we all start getting
yeast infections in our legs.

818
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,180
Did you hear that?
Eric Holder said today that they need to

819
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:55,950
stop arresting people for petty 
marijuana crimes and crimes where,

820
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:59,430
uh,
there's no victims or whether it's not a

821
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,460
connection to a drug cartels,
like it's like sort of snuck in under 

822
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,270
the radar,
but that's a gigantic statement from the

823
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:08,820
attorney general that they're going to 
like basically stopped this,

824
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,060
this aspect of the drug war.
They want to let people out of jail or 

825
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,400
prisons or fucking overcrowded,
like this is two things in the last week

826
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,460
that had been really surprising.
The Sanjay goop does CNN thing where 

827
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,000
he's coming out with a documentary on 
CNN called weed,

828
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:30,090
uh,
a year long investigation to the 

829
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,690
positive benefits of medical marijuana 
and all these people that are sick and 

830
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,901
all the different things that it cures 
all the different ailments that 

831
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:39,380
alleviates symptoms and this guy is like
coming out and putting out this big 

832
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,290
piece on CNN.com.

833
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,290
And the special saying I was wrong.
Like for years I believed mainstream 

834
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,890
America,
his opinion about marijuana,

835
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:51,891
it was a bunch of lazy slackers and I 
thought that most of the medical 

836
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:51,891
marijuana was just people trying to get 
high.

837
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,780
But now he realizes it's not.
And it's like there's massive,

838
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,330
massive medical benefits.
Losing power.

839
00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:00,020
My Di Lithium crystals,
I think they're getting ready to attend.

840
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,550
I think they're getting ready to go.
Our captain,

841
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,560
it seems like it.
That's what I'm saying.

842
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,640
If CNN puts it on tv like that,
I mean that's pretty crazy.

843
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:13,641
And then Eric holder saying we need to 
stop arresting people for petty crimes 

844
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:16,530
that don't involve drug cartels and 
marijuana offenses.

845
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,540
Like what?
Wait a minute.

846
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:23,070
That isn't that like 50 percent of the 
prison because the problem is nonviolent

847
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:28,071
drug offenders or a giant part of what's
in the prison system and making people 

848
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,700
much more likely to continue being 
criminals.

849
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,800
Like once you start putting people in 
jail,

850
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,320
that's when they're much more likely to 
start repeating crimes.

851
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:42,620
The idea of punishing people by putting 
them in jail doesn't really scares the 

852
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,140
shit out of 'em.
And if they're smart,

853
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:48,141
they don't do it again,
but it also introduces them to a bunch 

854
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,871
of other people that are fucking 
criminals and they all get together and 

855
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:53,331
they talk and they figured out what the 
fuck they're going to do together and 

856
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:54,990
once they get out of there,
and that's a way of turning a person who

857
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:59,991
just wants to sell something that should
be legal into a fucking criminal by 

858
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,800
putting them in a cage.
And what else in there?

859
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,420
Figuring that out.
This is crazy.

860
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,730
Yeah.
The government always seems to be a few,

861
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,860
a little behind on the,
uh,

862
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,820
on uh,
you know,

863
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,960
they're,
they're always the last ones to show up 

864
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,620
and say yes to something or no,
they have to cover every angle at it and

865
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,630
they have to realize that they can't 
control it and then they have to figure 

866
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:20,630
out how to make money off it.
Yeah.

867
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,660
But this is a,
this seems like a shift.

868
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,220
It seems like a shift in,
in just the way they communicate about 

869
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,930
it.
Um,

870
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,060
I mean these are new reforms aimed at 
curbing US prison population.

871
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,820
There's a big article,
the Guardian about this.

872
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,890
This is a pretty crazy shit

873
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:44,610
that the tobacco company,
I can't even talk to a company probably 

874
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:44,610
went to the government was like,
look,

875
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,051
we're losing shitloads of money because 
you're doing your fucking our crops up 

876
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:49,051
and you know,
making cigarettes so bad.

877
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:51,480
We want to get into this weed game and 
you know,

878
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,270
maybe that's like a way for Marlboro and
all these companies to keep a keep 

879
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,270
alive.

880
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,930
Well,
it's not just that.

881
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:02,931
It's also the projected revenue tax 
revenue from legalizing marijuana is 

882
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:05,670
giant.
It's billions in every state.

883
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:10,350
I mean it's the projected tax revenue.
It sounds so crazy,

884
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:13,740
but it's really true.
It could fix the United States economy.

885
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,950
That sounds fucking nuts,
but it really could.

886
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,040
There's so much money involved in 
marijuana and right now it's all 

887
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,021
slipping through the cracks.
It's all going on either illegally or 

888
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:28,440
its state as a medicinal sort of a 
thing,

889
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:31,920
and then they get eventually busted by 
the dea because it's not federal.

890
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,060
If they ease up that it changes our 
whole culture,

891
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,680
it's going to change everything at once.
People realize all the things you can do

892
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,980
with marijuana that don't involve 
getting high when you,

893
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,290
when they realize that the benefits of 
Hamp,

894
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:49,740
which has been illegal forever in this 
fucking country since the 19 thirties,

895
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:54,741
as long as marijuana has been illegal,
we can't grow hemp and the non 

896
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:58,971
psychoactive form of marijuana,
so the stocks of marijuana make it 

897
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:00,300
insanely good paper.

898
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,480
They make tremendous building materials 
that are biodegradable and lasts forever

899
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,830
and are stronger than steel.
It's really,

900
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:12,831
it's a funny fucking plan,
like it's got essential amino acids in 

901
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:16,791
it.
You can eat the protein from it because 

902
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:16,791
it gets you higher.
No.

903
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:16,791
Oh,
we can get you high,

904
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,390
but mean the stock,
the stock doesn't know.

905
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,690
I mean if you get the female flowers or 
we get you high,

906
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,380
so what you're getting when you get him,
it's you're either getting various 

907
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,281
strains which which are like we would,
I think technically you wouldn't refer 

908
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:36,741
to it as a cousin,
but it does get referred to as a cousin 

909
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:36,741
all the time,
but people correct me online,

910
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:39,180
so just that caveat,
but it's essentially the male version of

911
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:44,181
the plant and variations of the male 
versions of the plant and that doesn't 

912
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:49,191
have any psychoactive properties to it,
but you can make fucking ridiculously 

913
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:49,890
strong rope with it.

914
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,250
Like it's a weird plan.
Like you'll take a stock of this stuff.

915
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:58,251
Right?
I've seen it like this thick is light 

916
00:40:58,251 --> 00:40:58,251
like styrofoam but hard as a fucking 
rock.

917
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,900
It's weird.
It's a weird fucking plant.

918
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,950
It's like no plant that exists on earth.
It's really almost like it's an alien.

919
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,030
It's such a strange plant and it's so 
beneficial to humankind.

920
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:13,830
The fact that it's illegal is I'm just 
outside of the psychoactive effects,

921
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:16,710
if it had no effect on the human body 
whatsoever,

922
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,860
just for,
it's your ability to use in building 

923
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,621
materials,
the ability to make clothes and paper 

924
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:25,720
and oil and Henry Ford's first fucking 
car had him,

925
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:26,770
the,
the,

926
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,780
uh,
all of the body panels were made out of 

927
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,440
hemp and it ran on hemp.
Like he would make oil from hemp and run

928
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:34,070
engines

929
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,850
on it.
I mean,

930
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,410
you can do so much shit with it.
It's,

931
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,620
it's almost a joke,
like if you look at all the different 

932
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:41,660
things you could do with it and how 
could it be legal?

933
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,690
How could it be illegal?
Rather you wonder why there are certain 

934
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:46,690
things like I wonder why we can't go to 
Cuba.

935
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,160
There are certain things that government
does that a get a point.

936
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,840
It's like,
what the fuck are you doing?

937
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,841
Like after awhile it's like enough is 
enough of these little things like why 

938
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:56,270
can't I do that?
I'm not a baby.

939
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,540
We're not babies.
And I think that's what these things are

940
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:04,541
realizing.
There's a push by the American people 

941
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:07,120
and there's a transparency that the 
American people are demanding and under 

942
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,330
the weight of things like Edward Snowden
and uh,

943
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Bradley manning you all these,
these documents that to get it released 

944
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,460
where people are seeing the actual inner
workings of the government,

945
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:22,030
they have to make some radical reform if
they want to keep a hold of us because 

946
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,870
there's a lot of people that are upset 
right now finding out about the NSA,

947
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,510
watching every single American is if 
we're all bad.

948
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,670
But how about all of us?
Who Do?

949
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,470
Can I,
can it be like the Tsa?

950
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:33,570
Can I get up to tsa pre where you know 
that I'm not a fucking terrorist.

951
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:35,210
So you stop reading my email Dick.
Juan,

952
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,010
can I.
can we make that deal?

953
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:42,070
I have mixed feelings about the NSA.
I am a part of me loves that they did 

954
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,860
that because the American people have 
become such.

955
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,820
What bothers me about Americans is we 
become such nosy pigs into each other's 

956
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,400
lives and there's nothing in American 
loves more than violating the privacy of

957
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,330
somebody else.
True.

958
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Nothing we love more.
And now all of the sudden we don't like 

959
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,470
it because someone's invading our 
privacy.

960
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,630
Like I believe I get the difference of 
the government doing.

961
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:10,631
It's awful.
But I mean just the principle of it 

962
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:11,870
where all these fucking people.
I've said this before,

963
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:16,871
crying about privacy when they couldn't 
get enough of Mel Gibson's private voice

964
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:21,500
mails or Alec Baldwin's phone calls or 
our tiger woods is private texts.

965
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,800
Now I understand.
We look at them as entertainment value,

966
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:30,190
but people also are comfortable seeing 
those things and making judgements and 

967
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,120
treating people a certain way because of
them.

968
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,420
So they didn't give a fuck that anybody 
else's privacy was violated.

969
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,880
However,
their privacy is sacred.

970
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,720
So I kind of like Google glass and I 
liked this.

971
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,350
It evens the playing field.
Just,

972
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:44,810
you know,
like fucking does portray us.

973
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,990
The head of the CIA.
I couldn't fuck some chick on the side 

974
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,930
when he's married to Michael Moore.
How depressing is that?

975
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,460
And no one gets away with anything 
anymore.

976
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,580
So I wish the American people would stop
being so nosy and minding everyone's 

977
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,901
business but their own.
And I would completely be against the 

978
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:01,901
NSA,
but until that happens,

979
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:06,310
fuck them.
I love the fact that their privacy is 

980
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:06,310
being violated to and they can see how 
it feels.

981
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
Wow.
That's an angry Jimmy Norris.

982
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,280
Not even angry.
Just tired of not.

983
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,780
I'm not even mad at,
but I know what you're saying.

984
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:16,781
I agree with you to a certain extent 
that self righteousness that people 

985
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:17,090
have.
Like with Paula Deen,

986
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,450
they're comfortable allowing her to be 
lynched publicly and no one is stepping 

987
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:27,011
up and going,
you know what I've said some shitty 

988
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,991
things.
No one expresses that honesty in 

989
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:31,541
themselves and give each other breaks on
inappropriate things that we say or a 

990
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,520
little.
We're allowing moments

991
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,300
to define who people are and we all have
the moments.

992
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:36,980
Yes,
it's,

993
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,900
it's nuts.
And we might not have the moments to the

994
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:41,580
that varying.
Exactly that.

995
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,940
The degree of,
of fucked up attitude.

996
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,190
You know,
like I know she did a lot of.

997
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,180
I don't know what Paula Dean actually 
did,

998
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,550
but if you listen to what the people 
that work with her,

999
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,430
she sounds like she was a funny racist,
old white lady.

1000
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,170
I don't know,
I wouldn't,

1001
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,860
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't want to even guess of what it

1002
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:02,070
would be like to be a black guy working 
for her and hearing that shit coming out

1003
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:07,071
of her mouth work though.
I don't know if she did or supposedly 

1004
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:07,680
allegedly,
who the fuck knows?

1005
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:09,000
I mean,
that's what I read.

1006
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,270
That's what people were accusing her of.
Unless you're there,

1007
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,580
who knows?
In your.

1008
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,230
You're also dealing with disgruntled 
employees.

1009
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Wins.
Paul Dean winds the resource suit that 

1010
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,320
destroyed her.
How does she win?

1011
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,280
See her black friends that she hangs out
with?

1012
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:23,250
Oh,
she's got black friends.

1013
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,580
No big black guy with the hat.
It's probably gonna fucking cock.

1014
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,680
What is the,
uh,

1015
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,610
the,
the judgment.

1016
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:30,240
What does it say?

1017
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,820
Uh,
it says that,

1018
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:32,100
uh,
the,

1019
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,620
the,
the original lawsuit,

1020
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
a judge ruled that Lisa Jackson had no 
right to claim racial discrimination 

1021
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,841
because she's white.
Any comments that dean or her cohorts 

1022
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:44,510
may have had had no legal consequences.

1023
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,440
Oh,
so she tried to claim rakes,

1024
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,050
racial discrimination,
and she was white.

1025
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:50,390
She was just trying to get paid.
Yeah.

1026
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,090
Dirty can't.
Yeah.

1027
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:53,580
So,
but she destroyed Paula.

1028
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:54,540
Dean's pretty much

1029
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,240
Yam.
Nah,

1030
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,200
she'll be fine.
She's ruined.

1031
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,860
You think so?
Because again,

1032
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,560
no one.
You see Matt Lauer that fucking just bag

1033
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,230
sanctimonious interview he did with her.
Yeah.

1034
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,680
That wasn't nice,
but he couldn't like where was this?

1035
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,470
Where was one ounce of honesty and this 
guy like,

1036
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,500
maybe you've never said that word,
but are you going to tell me you've 

1037
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,961
never in your life under oath,
you could say you've never said a 

1038
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:20,961
racially insensitive thing.
Bullshit.

1039
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:22,250
Bullshit.
Yeah.

1040
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,090
I think he's got a problem and his 
problem is that he's.

1041
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,440
He's a talking head on the inner on 
television who's not allowed to have 

1042
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,900
anything even remotely controversial 
come out of his mouth and he's also 

1043
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,560
terrified because he's in that box.
So for him to like try to.

1044
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,650
First of all,
you can't do that in a little 

1045
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,810
conversation.
If you're going to have a conversation 

1046
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:47,810
with that woman about the world,
about racism,

1047
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,970
you're going to have to sit down with 
her like this.

1048
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:53,970
You're going to have to podcast.
We'll have a three hour conversation 

1049
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:53,970
with her.
Find out who are you,

1050
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,750
what,
what did you do,

1051
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:59,751
like your giving and you'll know by the 
end of three hours whether or not she's 

1052
00:46:59,751 --> 00:46:59,751
full of Shit.
Yeah,

1053
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:00,570
you will.
You'll know everyone will be able to.

1054
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,780
You could bullshit your way through a 
five minute conversation on the tonight 

1055
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,631
show.
You can't bullshit your way through 

1056
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:08,631
three hours,
not at all,

1057
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,620
and I think this is an issue that really
needed to be addressed like that.

1058
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:15,621
It's can't like have a quick Matt Lauer 
interview with this scared lady in a 

1059
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:19,731
scared old lady that has fucking death 
threats coming in from black people all 

1060
00:47:19,731 --> 00:47:21,660
day.
I'm sure you know you can't.

1061
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,040
You can't be a white person in 2013 
calling people niggers phony,

1062
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,260
phony outrage and studied with within 
black people who get annoyed.

1063
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:29,770
It is

1064
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,650
when I've grown to hate his other white 
people.

1065
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,840
Patrice said it,
Patrice said it best.

1066
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,280
He goes,
I've never met a racist.

1067
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,490
Not One person I've ever admitted 
admitted has ever admitted they were 

1068
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,611
racist.
And what I hate about these fucking 

1069
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,221
these white people whose idea of 
combating racism is just targeting other

1070
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:52,321
white people who have said something 
inappropriate is simply their way of 

1071
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:53,560
deflecting attention from themselves and
their own.

1072
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,620
I think they have superiority complexes 
and I think like I can't walk up to my 

1073
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,440
black friends and tell them,
hey,

1074
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:01,930
I'm not a racist.
But if Paula deen acts like one,

1075
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,510
then I can use her to mirror how good I 
am.

1076
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:08,980
It's a self serving proposition and I 
hate it and I don't buy it.

1077
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,200
I just don't buy it,
man.

1078
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:15,270
Yeah,
I agree with you that there's a lot of 

1079
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,270
people that love to do that moral high 
ground.

1080
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:20,040
Yes.
They loved by not by telling you that 

1081
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,370
you're doing something wrong.
They're not just telling you that you're

1082
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:26,371
doing something wrong.
They're telling you that they're 

1083
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:26,371
awesome.
Yes.

1084
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:27,610
That's a big thing.
And it's in their tone and it's in their

1085
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:32,611
lack of the lack of self revealing they 
do in these moments and in these 

1086
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:37,351
discussions,
if they revealed ugliness about 

1087
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:37,351
themselves,
I would have respect for them.

1088
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:41,221
Like,
why am I comfortable talking about a 

1089
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:43,830
paddle,
Brian's dirty voicemails or tiger woods 

1090
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,080
is dirty text messages because I talk 
about my own,

1091
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,170
like I'll make fun of his,
but I'll tell you that I,

1092
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:48,600
I also have texted my cock to many 
people.

1093
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,180
I'm a piece of shit so I'm not coming.
I'm not better than him and I refuse to 

1094
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:54,480
come off like that.
Yeah,

1095
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,940
there's a real problem with people 
thinking that you need to be better than

1096
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:02,941
people too.
It's like especially pretending that 

1097
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:06,421
should never work.
So claiming the moral high ground and 

1098
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:07,330
becoming the super white knight and 
pretending that you know,

1099
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:12,190
you're there to defend all women.
It's this shit doesn't work.

1100
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,120
It never works because the type of women
you get from faking that shit.

1101
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:21,150
I mean,
you might really be that guy and if you 

1102
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:21,150
are,
God bless you.

1103
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,300
But if you're faking it well,
who's going to trick one average girl 

1104
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,930
with glasses and a stupid tattoo with 
words on her arm,

1105
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,610
fucking blow fucking baggy jeans.

1106
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,250
You're not going to get much out of it.
Have you ever banged a feminist?

1107
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,560
Um,
I'm sure I have,

1108
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,420
um,
you know,

1109
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,800
uh,
yeah,

1110
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:44,680
I've banged some very was I liked strong
women a lot.

1111
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,860
I don't like I'm strong.
Yes.

1112
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:53,170
I like that type of woman a lot.
A lot of them are sexually submissive,

1113
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:58,370
like lawyers that I've fucked up in 
sexual submissive female cops because 

1114
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:58,480
they're very strong and uh,
you know,

1115
00:49:58,481 --> 00:50:00,450
they liked something different.
You all,

1116
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,460
I'm sure,
but I have nothing against the feminist 

1117
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,340
if she's reasonable and she's fighting 
for women to get what they deserve,

1118
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:11,230
I'm for it when the language police and 
they nitpick because their causes not as

1119
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:16,231
needed as it was 20 years ago.
Then I hate their guts like any other 

1120
00:50:16,231 --> 00:50:19,261
special interest group,
but when they're fighting for what's 

1121
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:19,530
right and legitimately getting the right
amount of money and be like,

1122
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,430
I don't think women should be sexually 
harassed at work.

1123
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,730
Like these guys had like this fucking 
cock sucker in San Diego who's grabbing 

1124
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,980
women and being a complete of shit and

1125
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,960
saying he didn't know.
Fuck that guy.

1126
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:32,480
Like one of those women's husbands 
should fucking hit this guy with an ax.

1127
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,220
Yeah.
He would be hard to imagine your wife 

1128
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,850
being at work with some latch all day 
was like constantly harassing him,

1129
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,570
bothering her and brushes or cock buyer 
when she walks by her in the hall,

1130
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,660
you know,
that kind of shit that happens to people

1131
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,990
at work and people go,
look,

1132
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:50,930
I was just walking by and then what's 
the big people are always being.

1133
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,550
Yep.
But that's a can.

1134
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,560
It doesn't matter if he's a man or a 
woman,

1135
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,390
you know?
I think,

1136
00:50:56,391 --> 00:51:01,391
uh,
I think the idea of feminism is a good 

1137
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,290
idea as the idea of masculinism that's a
good idea to.

1138
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,320
I want to think it's a real word,
but if it was a real word to be a good 

1139
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,320
idea,
there's nothing,

1140
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,070
there's nothing wrong with you being 
allowed to be you and me being allowed 

1141
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,700
to be me and we're going to be fucking 
different.

1142
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,670
That's why the world varies so much.
That's why movies,

1143
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,080
very music varies.
It's stand up.

1144
00:51:19,081 --> 00:51:24,081
Comedy varies.
There's people that like all kinds of 

1145
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,621
different shit,
but a lot of men don't want women to be 

1146
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:28,280
women and a lot of women don't want men 
to be men.

1147
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:31,300
They want them to be what they want them
to be and when,

1148
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,390
when you have,
when you have some asshole who wants you

1149
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:39,830
to be a certain way and you have to work
for that Dick and you're a woman,

1150
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,160
that's a special place in hell.
I mean,

1151
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,150
that's a fucking horrible place in hell,
but it has nothing to do with this.

1152
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,530
It's not a sex thing.
It's not an all gender thing.

1153
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,090
He said,
that guy's a piece of shit.

1154
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,800
Yeah.
Here's a picture.

1155
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,630
You just found a piece of shit.
It just happens to be a man,

1156
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,440
but guess what?

1157
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,560
If you're a man and you have a boss and 
your boss is a woman and she's a fucking

1158
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,690
asshole.
I have a friend who has a woman ball.

1159
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:03,110
Yeah.
He actually just left his Gig,

1160
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,050
but he had this woman boss.
We brutalized him.

1161
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,810
Just wouldn't,
just wouldn't leave them alone.

1162
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:11,800
It was just like giving them cancer,
just like rotting Adam,

1163
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,810
like all day,
every day with someone who you couldn't 

1164
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,571
talk back to who was just fucking with 
you in pastoring you and B rating you 

1165
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:22,490
and insulting you and there's not a damn
thing you can do to take it.

1166
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,790
Not a damn thing you can do about.
She was talking to him in a way that a 

1167
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,930
regular man would never like a man in 
the street that did,

1168
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,940
you didn't owe anything to,
would never talk to you when she was 

1169
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:33,940
ready to fight.
Yeah.

1170
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,350
But she would just get in his face and 
pointed him and say crazy shit to him.

1171
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,290
Has nothing to do now and there's 
nothing to get done and that's why she's

1172
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:39,680
doing it.
Yeah.

1173
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah.
I mean she would ask him if he was 

1174
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,160
stupid.
Are you stupid?

1175
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,160
Are you stupid?
Like in like,

1176
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,640
wow,
I have to listen to this.

1177
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,350
You know,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1178
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:51,080
You're just stuck.
That shouldn't be right.

1179
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,010
And it shouldn't be right for any human 
being to do that to another human being,

1180
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,180
should have said stupid,
is as stupid does,

1181
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,600
and then given a khaki look.
So in that sense,

1182
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,690
yeah,
I'm a feminist and a lot of ways on 

1183
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:04,690
masculinity.
So I'm a humanist.

1184
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:04,690
I think we should be able to do whatever
we want.

1185
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,710
The problem is when you start looking 
out for your own,

1186
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,500
when you start looking out for a gender 
or a generalization,

1187
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:12,530
you start going towards one gender only 
emphasizing that one.

1188
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:16,940
Gender inequities,
inadequacies in our society.

1189
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:21,260
The problem is you become a gang and you
become a part of a team.

1190
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,130
Right?
But the thing is,

1191
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:26,100
is that what I hate about people much as
they say,

1192
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,800
uh,
because they're,

1193
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,880
they're not consistent.
Like I don't.

1194
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:32,400
Everything should be the same.
And I don't want.

1195
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,800
Nothing should be different unless 
you're talking about diversity,

1196
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:38,130
then it's good.
I don't like any kind of profiling.

1197
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,650
It's wrong,
unless of course it's a,

1198
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,370
it's an ethnic pride parade,
then we can all profile.

1199
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,690
It's a delightful idea.
I'd be proud to be Irish.

1200
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,550
So people only want grand sweeping 
generalizations when they're a part of a

1201
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:53,580
good grand sweeping generalization,
if they're a part of it.

1202
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:58,630
Like it's funny,
I go through TSA security and they're 

1203
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,060
now saying anybody under 12 or over 75 
does not have to take your shoes off.

1204
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,540
And I have not heard one person 
complaining about age discrimination.

1205
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:09,020
I'm over 75.
Why am I not being treated the same as 

1206
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,541
these other people?
I have not heard one fucking parent 

1207
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:11,541
saying,
my kids under 12.

1208
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:12,060
Why aren't you treating them like 
everybody else?

1209
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,450
It's only when we're treated in a manner
that we don't approve of,

1210
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,250
that we take this principle of,
hey,

1211
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:18,480
don't treat me differently.
It's,

1212
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:20,670
it's,
it's arbitrary and it's bullshit.

1213
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,770
So that's why you can't respect any of 
it.

1214
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,490
Makes me crazy.
Yeah.

1215
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,130
I'm not a big fan of groups.
Um,

1216
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,030
I'm really not a big fan of groups have 
focused on one gender.

1217
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,600
I'm a big fan of generalizations.
I'm not a big fan of a lot of things.

1218
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:38,990
I'm certainly not a big fan of anything 
where anyone who is the weaker is 

1219
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:42,800
getting bullied.
Whether it's physical,

1220
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,120
whether it's a sexual thing or physical 
thing,

1221
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,020
or a man bugging a woman,
a sister.

1222
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,340
I have daughters.
I have a wife,

1223
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,060
I I 100 percent.
No,

1224
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:59,061
it's way more difficult to be a woman 
than it is to be a man in the physical 

1225
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:01,860
sense and I think there should be laws 
about that shit abso-fucking-lutely.

1226
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,860
I think that men who do abuse women or 
who do sexually harassing their fucking 

1227
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:10,320
creepy people are tripping but so are 
women who do it too,

1228
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,420
man.
And the idea that that's not the case.

1229
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,440
The,
the idea that a situation where a man 

1230
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,300
who gets taken by a woman in a divorce 
and some fucking horrible way where you 

1231
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,250
know,
you find.

1232
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,910
I mean,
I could go into this for days,

1233
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:28,911
but I'm sure we all know guys who just 
been raped and divorce.

1234
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:30,170
Some of us do radio.
What day?

1235
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,970
Yeah.
Anthony got murdered.

1236
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,910
I know some.
I know a guy who lost millions.

1237
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,640
I know my favorite story.
I even talked about them on my act.

1238
00:55:38,641 --> 00:55:43,641
He had to pay for his wife's attorney 
and his wife dragged the thing out for 

1239
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:45,840
years.
So he is paying for the enemy's general,

1240
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,260
so he's going to war for all of his 
money and he winded up costing him 

1241
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:51,260
everything.

1242
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,070
I mean it was just a devastating several
year event that she wouldn't.

1243
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,610
She was doing it on purpose to try to 
drag it out and to try to milk him.

1244
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,040
When you see some shit like that,
you think like,

1245
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,960
okay,
men should have rights to.

1246
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,370
Okay.
Yes,

1247
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,430
absolutely.
He's not in a sense it's not the same 

1248
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:10,430
thing as him being raped.
Absolutely.

1249
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,190
But he's being financially destroyed and
he's.

1250
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Someone's doing it in a spiteful way 
when they're doing it because they just 

1251
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,300
grew to hate him or whatever the fuck it
was.

1252
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,030
But there should be a law against that.
Like they didn't even have children.

1253
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,460
Like it was one of the craziest things 
I've ever seen in my life.

1254
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,700
When you find out what happens if a man 
and woman are together for x amount of 

1255
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,571
years,
then he has to pay for her for the rest 

1256
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:36,571
of her life.

1257
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:36,571
Yeah.
But he doesn't get the fucker.

1258
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:36,760
That's the beautiful part.
Like she's like,

1259
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:37,980
well I have a lifestyle.
He said,

1260
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,860
well,
I was expecting I,

1261
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:41,830
I was used to getting blown and having 
your ass in my face.

1262
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,780
How about that?
What we're used to remember Chris Rock's

1263
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:48,781
bit about that,
you know about alimony and pussy 

1264
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:48,781
payments.
Yeah,

1265
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:48,781
he had it.
He had a whole book,

1266
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,370
a book about it,
like I believe in Amway,

1267
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,970
but I also believe in pussy payments.
Yeah.

1268
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,480
This,
you know,

1269
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,540
there's all sorts of inequality in this 
world of both projected towards women 

1270
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,650
and projected towards men and there's 
all sorts of assholes in the world,

1271
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,680
both women and men.
There's just assholes and that's a real 

1272
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,371
problem in this life.
It's not lumping ourselves into groups 

1273
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:15,760
and generalizing that all women are good
and all men are bad or vice versa.

1274
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,920
That's crazy too.

1275
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:22,190
What's what's important is recognizing 
that there's really only three types of 

1276
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:22,630
people in the world.
Morons,

1277
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,210
assholes,
and people that are all right.

1278
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,830
You know,
you might not agree with them.

1279
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:28,150
You might not like them.
You might.

1280
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,370
They might not be your style.
They might be different.

1281
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,190
Morons,
assholes,

1282
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:38,340
and people that are all right.
That's really all there is in this 

1283
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,831
world.
We're also paying for the sins of a lot 

1284
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:40,831
of other people for centuries,
let's,

1285
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:45,110
you know,
white American men dominated everything 

1286
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:45,110
in this country and then like,
you know,

1287
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:49,651
there's also a reality of a lot of 
people were treated like garbage for a 

1288
00:57:49,651 --> 00:57:54,241
long time and a lot of promises were 
broken and there's a reality to that 

1289
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:54,700
that's not excuse making,
it's not,

1290
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,270
it's a real thing.
And then they say,

1291
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,260
well,
you know,

1292
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,540
white people have benefited from that 
system.

1293
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:01,710
Even.

1294
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,800
So what's happening is in an effort to 
balance the playing field a little bit,

1295
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,160
a lot of us today are being treated 
unfairly because the balancing act is 

1296
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,670
making things go so far.
And like I do understand that.

1297
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,720
That's why I had a conversation after a 
Tosh is uh,

1298
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,450
uh,
and who did they get,

1299
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:19,930
oh,
Tracy's gay jokes.

1300
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:25,220
And I had to come from folks that don't 
know Tracy Morgan did a joke about if 

1301
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,990
his son was gay,
he would stab them.

1302
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,230
And everybody went crazy.
And I had a couple of gay comics on Rick

1303
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,660
Chrome and Jim David and we talked about
this on this comedy special.

1304
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:32,860
I did,
and uh,

1305
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:37,861
the as Comedians,
I asked them how do they feel about the 

1306
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:40,171
imbalance in the language,
like the fact that you get in trouble 

1307
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:40,171
for that now.
And Jim David said,

1308
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:41,530
I'm okay with it and uh,
I'm like,

1309
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:42,910
well,
how are you okay with it as a comic?

1310
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,560
And he goes,
because it's not a level playing field,

1311
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,110
meaning what he thought was like in 
life,

1312
00:58:47,111 --> 00:58:50,020
gay people had not treated as well,
so he didn't give a shit if,

1313
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,290
if that guy got in a little bit more 
trouble and I kind of,

1314
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,570
I heard what he said.
They're like,

1315
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,200
even though I don't want to get in 
trouble for it,

1316
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,180
in that sense,
he was right.

1317
00:58:58,181 --> 00:58:59,590
It's like,
you know,

1318
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:05,310
we still have a big segment of our 
country that can't get married and 

1319
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:05,320
they're treated like second class 
citizens,

1320
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,930
but yet we go around and tell other 
countries had to live their lives.

1321
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,210
Which soulfully shit.
It makes me nuts.

1322
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,360
Well,
I think that there's a real legitimate 

1323
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,491
argument in the idea that until it 
balances out,

1324
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:22,130
until everyone completely relaxes on 
discrimination

1325
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:22,940
towards gays,
like,

1326
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,820
like there's no discrimination on 
bachelors anymore,

1327
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,370
you know,
like of a man as a 50 year old man,

1328
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,780
he says,
I'm just not getting married again.

1329
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,750
There no discrimination or social,
not a social pariah,

1330
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,290
but if he decides to marry a man than it
is like,

1331
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:36,830
well what?
Well,

1332
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,040
what is that and why is that not 
eradicated from our culture yet?

1333
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:45,041
Well,
once that is eradicated from our 

1334
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:45,041
culture,
then I think people are going to be much

1335
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,850
more likely to accept gay jokes much 
more like.

1336
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,990
Because I keep hearing that gay jokes or
homophobic and I'm like,

1337
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:51,620
guess what?
No,

1338
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,600
they're not.
It's not homophobic at all.

1339
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:58,601
It's a gay joke.
Just like jokes about straight sex 

1340
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:00,630
aren't heterophobia alright.
They're jokes about sex and there's,

1341
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,520
there's jokes about everything and it's 
really about context.

1342
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:09,521
It's not about the subject matter and 
you can't eliminate certain subject 

1343
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:09,521
matters.

1344
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:12,320
You just can't because the human 
language is very nuance.

1345
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:17,321
There's a lot of shit going on and every
single interaction that you have we're 

1346
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:21,460
humor could potentially be crafted from.
It can be taken into a whole wide 

1347
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,140
variety of different ways and I like all
of those ways.

1348
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,840
I like people saying fucked up shit.
They don't really mean.

1349
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,780
I think there's something funny and 
Tracy Morgan saying if a funnel,

1350
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:34,670
most of them with girls I.
and it's ridiculous.

1351
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,320
It's ludicrous,
right?

1352
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:38,780
It's not real.
Of course he wouldn't do that.

1353
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,610
Of course it would be,
you know,

1354
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,050
it's,
it's ridiculous.

1355
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,370
The idea that it's like,
I do a joke in my Mac,

1356
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,640
like guess what?
Johnny cash didn't really shoot a man in

1357
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:49,240
Reno just to watch them die either.
Maybe it's,

1358
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,220
I don't think he did.
He might be more likely that he did it.

1359
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:53,820
Then Tracy Morgan would stab his son.

1360
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,760
Stupid Johnny.
Johnny.

1361
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,880
Johnny cash probably should have said I 
took some pills and fell asleep on the 

1362
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:00,880
tour bus.
That might be more accurate,

1363
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,560
but I get what we're gay people are 
coming from too though,

1364
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:07,340
because it's not a level playing field.
So when you see like all this,

1365
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,310
like it's almost like shitting on people
when they're down.

1366
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:11,990
Like,
here's a perfect example,

1367
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,290
like um,
this,

1368
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,430
this opioid thing that's going on with 
this,

1369
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:21,431
uh,
if you don't know ob many years ago 

1370
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:24,370
stomped on his homeless guys cake and he
thought it would be cute to put it 

1371
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,830
online and people are so fucking mad at 
them because it's a really douchey thing

1372
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:29,390
to do.
It's been online for years though.

1373
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:32,300
He just retweeted it.
I think it's two for seven years.

1374
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,510
But the fact that he will,
what people didn't like,

1375
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:40,511
his people have a sense of humanity and 
they look at this guy and he's a 

1376
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:40,511
homeless guy.

1377
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:44,550
He's fucking down and out and here's 
this millionaire radio dj who thinks 

1378
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,500
it's funny to stomp on his cake.
Like,

1379
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,120
you know what I mean?
In that context.

1380
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:52,121
Like I.
and that's something that unfortunately 

1381
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:52,121
you can't,
like what would,

1382
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:53,060
how we would do a walk over from Iraq 
everyday,

1383
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,340
which you did with us.
And that guy was,

1384
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:57,950
that was Andrew and he was the guy we 
saw everyday.

1385
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,530
He was a guy we talked to.
We had on the air,

1386
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,870
we gave money to them.
We would give them food,

1387
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:05,210
like we had a really good relationship 
with this guy.

1388
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:10,420
I think that's why he was offering cake 
because we had stopped by so many times 

1389
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,590
and handed him food.
He had some cake and open a dick thing,

1390
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:17,591
but it was just.
It was literally just to make everybody 

1391
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:20,621
laugh.
It wasn't to dehumanize this guy or to 

1392
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:20,621
degrade

1393
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:25,250
him.
It was something he would have done to 

1394
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:25,510
anybody else that he knew and I know 
that that made people go well too,

1395
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,430
but the reality was the context of that 
relationship with Andrew,

1396
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:32,400
the homeless guy was not some,
hey bomb,

1397
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:34,560
here's some money.
We can do what we want.

1398
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,660
It didn't feel like that.
It didn't come off like that one.

1399
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,000
I really depressed after stomped.
Just started drinking again too.

1400
01:02:41,001 --> 01:02:43,620
We were trying to get him sober and a 
good way to do it.

1401
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,170
Well,
you know,

1402
01:02:45,171 --> 01:02:46,440
there's a piece of shit cake.
Anyway,

1403
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:51,441
it was a fucking garbage.
I see you're supporting oprah and I'm 

1404
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:55,641
friends with too.
I'm supporting opiod only because I was 

1405
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:57,630
there through that entire walk over with
Andrew and I saw him 50 times before and

1406
01:02:57,631 --> 01:02:59,340
after that.
So in context,

1407
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,230
yeah,
I would have been fucking.

1408
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,150
It was.
It was cringy and I was like,

1409
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:04,290
Oh God.

1410
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,560
Did he give him anything after he 
stumped on this cake to give them any 

1411
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:09,560
money?
Of course he did.

1412
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:09,560
We gave him anything.
He,

1413
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,700
I'm like $100 and then people will 
going.

1414
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,870
That wasn't good enough.
I feel like this is what I'm saying.

1415
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:13,440
They're like,
oh,

1416
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:15,240
you could to humanize them and give him 
100 bucks.

1417
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,900
But it wasn't looked at like nobody felt
like wow,

1418
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:23,901
he dehumanized this guy because he was 
somebody we talked to all the time and 

1419
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:27,561
had great interactions with.
So that's why it didn't feel like I 

1420
01:03:27,561 --> 01:03:30,150
understand people seeing it though and 
going home like the fuck is going on you

1421
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:35,151
piece of shit.
Like I get seeing a one and a half 

1422
01:03:35,151 --> 01:03:38,540
minute clip.
Maybe I would feel the same way if I 

1423
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,630
didn't have the luxury of having been 
there throughout that entire time.

1424
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,120
We'll what we see.
Here's a perfect example.

1425
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:47,180
If if that homeless guy was getting in 
an argument with another homeless guy 

1426
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:51,831
and the homeless guy jumped on his cake,
then it would be okay because there's 

1427
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:53,820
one homeless guy getting over on another
homeless guy and stomp on kick,

1428
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,850
but when a millionaire guy does it,
look,

1429
01:03:56,851 --> 01:04:01,380
I know what he was doing and I know what
that that audience is like when you're.

1430
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,440
When you guys are opie and Anthony is my
favorite show ever to do because it's 

1431
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,911
such a hang and everybody's making 
everybody else laugh and it's like what 

1432
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:12,030
we were talking about before the show 
today.

1433
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:17,031
It's like what?
What's okay for you and I to talk about 

1434
01:04:17,031 --> 01:04:21,531
in our jobs,
like I stand up comedians for most 

1435
01:04:21,531 --> 01:04:22,470
people that,
that those same words and thoughts would

1436
01:04:22,471 --> 01:04:24,870
get you fired,
will get you kicked out of the office.

1437
01:04:24,871 --> 01:04:26,700
You get written up,
you can get sued.

1438
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,810
You can't have that sort of mentality.
But for us it's so normal.

1439
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,900
So when you're hanging out with opie and
Anthony [inaudible] and you guys are 

1440
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,951
just talking mad shit and you're on the 
air as you're walking across the street 

1441
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:40,650
and you're just trying to make each 
other laugh.

1442
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,800
And one of the things that people do 
when they try to make each other laugh 

1443
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,330
is it crossed the line.
They're completely brutally crossed the 

1444
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,710
line and that's the way to do that.
They're brutally crossed the line.

1445
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:53,490
You've got to jump on the homeless guys,
cake and Opie in doing that,

1446
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,810
it sounds like a cop out on my part 
because he's my friend and I would never

1447
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,960
have done what he did,
but I know what his motivation was.

1448
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,600
It was exactly.
And your audience will accept a lot,

1449
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,510
but honestly there is a humanity to 
them.

1450
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,310
Like that homeless shopping spree we 
would do.

1451
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,390
The homeless guys would never mistreat.
Like they were treated like rock stars.

1452
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,660
They would go to the mall,
thousands of people would be cheering 

1453
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:17,860
them,
buying them shit with their people.

1454
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:18,070
We had

1455
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,830
gotten to know.
So it was like the people who mentioned,

1456
01:05:19,831 --> 01:05:21,190
oh,
then they would do the homeless shopping

1457
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:22,960
spree.
It's like they weren't.

1458
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,930
It didn't feel like,
oh my God,

1459
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,500
it felt like a fucked up thing to do,
but it didn't feel as literal as,

1460
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,740
oh my God,
he's a millionaire stepping on the food 

1461
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,921
of a homeless man,
because I don't think that was the 

1462
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:38,880
intent behind it other than just being a
dick in that moment to a guy who he knew

1463
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:41,370
we had given food money to and we were 
going to give money to the.

1464
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:42,940
It's like,
I know what you're saying.

1465
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,730
I know it was just a momentary dick 
thing to do.

1466
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,440
And he did it in the sense of humor.
It's silly not to humiliate Andrew.

1467
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:55,441
Nobody wanted to hear.
The problem is when you see things out 

1468
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:55,441
of context,
it's like you were talking about earlier

1469
01:05:55,441 --> 01:06:00,031
about Paula Dean,
you don't know the entirety of a person 

1470
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:01,180
when you see one event is a great guy.

1471
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,950
We had him on the podcast,
he's a great guy.

1472
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,270
And I,
uh,

1473
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:06,880
I always credit you guys with being the 
reasons.

1474
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,640
One of the reasons why I wanted her to 
get into podcasting in the first place,

1475
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,850
it was because of doing your show 
because your show was the only show that

1476
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:17,851
I had ever done where it was just no,
there was no like rigid set of like,

1477
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:22,950
this is this now and then we're going to
go to the wacky five at five and then 

1478
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:23,620
there's bomb on the chopper.
There was nothing.

1479
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,870
It was a hang.
It was a complete total hang.

1480
01:06:25,871 --> 01:06:28,570
Every time I've ever done it,
whether it's with [inaudible] or with.

1481
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,630
I mean fucking how many times have I 
done it?

1482
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,440
I've done it so many times with so many 
different comics with rich or with never

1483
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:40,441
cut a deal with patrice.
The only thing I did with Patrice was 

1484
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:40,441
when we did that thing in vegas 
together,

1485
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:40,441
which was a lot of.

1486
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:41,560
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

1487
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:43,840
that's all I got to hang with.
Patrice is the only time I really got to

1488
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:48,841
hang with them outside of like seeing 
them early on in the day when I didn't 

1489
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:53,041
even know him.
He was one of my favorite people even 

1490
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:55,921
though he was very dominating and with 
no one could out Yap and Patrice 

1491
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:58,921
loudness,
but he was so much fun to do radio with 

1492
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:03,970
like he was one of my favorite guys ever
because to make him like if you made him

1493
01:07:03,971 --> 01:07:05,800
laugh,
he,

1494
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:10,830
you knew you were funny.
He didn't give it to people for no 

1495
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:14,910
reason.
He didn't get pity bullshit fee and he 

1496
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,060
was just too unconcerned with hurting 
people's feelings to do that.

1497
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:18,010
He didn't care.
Um,

1498
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:23,140
and one of my favorite things with him 
as I convinced him that face officers 

1499
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,730
shitty movie and that's one of my,
it's one of my favorite moment.

1500
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,130
It happened to k rock.
It was John Travolta and Nick K,

1501
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,640
Nick Cage,
who he was arguing he loved that.

1502
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:33,610
He loved it and I fucking convinced,
but it was a fun,

1503
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:35,760
friendly to watch him go like,
ah,

1504
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,570
ah,
like to see him.

1505
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,340
He made me.
It was one of my favorite moments of all

1506
01:07:42,341 --> 01:07:44,110
time in that,
just to see this,

1507
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,320
this because he was such a giant of a 
guy intellectually,

1508
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:50,280
like the greatest mistake people could 
make with patrice fifth to think,

1509
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,520
oh,
he's a big black guy.

1510
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Patrice was a brilliant motherfucker and
could outtalk almost anybody and could 

1511
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,200
out logic almost.
So when you,

1512
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,090
when you had moments like that,
it was friendly,

1513
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:02,860
you know,
it wasn't like an aggressive argument.

1514
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:03,760
You're like,
God,

1515
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:06,310
that just was one of the most satisfying
moments in my career.

1516
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,070
Yeah.
Well,

1517
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:12,150
it's the opportunity to be around fun 
people like that rare human beings that 

1518
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:16,190
you don't necessarily come across and 
you have a regular job.

1519
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,500
If you're working as a,
an insurance salesman.

1520
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,740
How many patrice o'neal's do you come 
across in your life that you get to hang

1521
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:26,741
out with?
Just by calling so late on their 

1522
01:08:26,741 --> 01:08:26,741
payments?
Quite,

1523
01:08:26,741 --> 01:08:27,530
quite a few.
I think one more thing,

1524
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:28,310
by the way,
before I forget,

1525
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:30,010
I wanted to say about ob to,
uh,

1526
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,460
about homeless is a,
you know,

1527
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:32,750
he's the one,
not that it matters,

1528
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:37,751
but he's the guy that pushed homeless,
mustered through the Daniel Mustard and 

1529
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:42,161
a and tried to get a recording contract 
and like really try to take care of the 

1530
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:42,161
guy that's the guy singing that song 
creep,

1531
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:43,610
creep,
really talented,

1532
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:48,940
talented,
but it's like an opie took a real 

1533
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:48,940
concern with him in his sobriety.
And again,

1534
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,480
I'm not saying people don't get,
I'm not trying to say don't be mad,

1535
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:52,010
be mad,
but again,

1536
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:57,280
don't think you understand the totality 
of a guy because he did one silly thing 

1537
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,400
in a different context to make his radio
guys.

1538
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,580
And some fans laugh.
You're so good at breaking shit down.

1539
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:02,660
Dude.
You,

1540
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,930
you said that there was not a hint of 
bias there.

1541
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:07,610
You were being completely honest about 
it.

1542
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:10,730
That's,
I really value that in the way you talk.

1543
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:15,820
And that's why I was really happy when I
watched that Kamau bell show will come 

1544
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:21,790
out about I totally biased command,
which was web model w Kamau Bell,

1545
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,460
you and Lindy West,
Lindy West who's a,

1546
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,180
a feminist blogger for a Jezza bell,
which is a feminist website.

1547
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,370
And what I loved about it,
man was first of all,

1548
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:39,371
you never got upset you,
you were rational and logical and you 

1549
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:44,081
had,
you were talking about it in a very 

1550
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:46,871
measured way and you're being really 
friendly while you were discussing this 

1551
01:09:46,871 --> 01:09:47,990
and you know,
in her,

1552
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:52,040
in her defense,
it's a very tricky subject to breach for

1553
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:57,041
a woman.
And she was saying a lot of shit like 

1554
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:57,560
comedy clubs are filled with rooms 
filled with angry men.

1555
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,450
And you didn't,
you didn't even flinch.

1556
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,580
He didn't,
he didn't go after her,

1557
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:04,220
you know,
like she had like these digs about like,

1558
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:05,810
you know,
you're allowed to just joke about it,

1559
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:07,280
but I'm allowed to tell you you're a 
dick.

1560
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,170
Yeah.
I didn't get personally could.

1561
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,280
I didn't think she liked.
She hadn't.

1562
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,830
The blog wasn't about me.
It was about a guy who,

1563
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,360
one guy making a Dick joke or certain 
rape jokes that put,

1564
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,870
and this is the tricky part of Lindy 
West,

1565
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:20,240
he's a lot of people would say she's 
against she's presenting ship,

1566
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,520
but she really wasn't.
She was about.

1567
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:27,730
She didn't like the jokes that she 
thought minimalize the victim in a rape 

1568
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,370
right now.
It's hard to logically say,

1569
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:28,970
well,
yeah,

1570
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,680
minimalizing,
the victim of rape is a good thing,

1571
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,190
but what people forget,
they went after Sam morale.

1572
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:35,540
A lot of jokes or just Mrs.

1573
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:41,140
He's a comedian in New York who had done
something like domestic violence jokes 

1574
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:44,801
or whatever,
but in a misdirection joke you you go 

1575
01:10:44,801 --> 01:10:48,230
for the most obvious.
We're opposite thing,

1576
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,850
so sometimes it is a violent sometimes 
like I did one joke and this didn't come

1577
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:55,820
up in that show,
but like I was talking about seeing it a

1578
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:59,330
girl now I don't know if she had a good 
time what was raped at a Porta potty.

1579
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,890
I'm not going to go through the whole 
joke before,

1580
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,380
but those were.
It was at a concert and outdoor concert.

1581
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:08,680
So the two most opposite things I could 
think of if I said I didn't know if she 

1582
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,220
had a good time,
we're not a very good time.

1583
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,480
Who gives a shit?
Fuck.

1584
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:13,500
You raped in a Porta potty.

1585
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:19,300
Painting a picture.
If I said I didn't know if she was 

1586
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:19,300
beaten in Porta potty or raped in a 
Porta potty,

1587
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,130
nobody would've laughed because they're 
too close.

1588
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,320
So the fact I.
I'm explaining this to the audience,

1589
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:25,740
not just the fact that you take two 
things that are such polar opposites.

1590
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:30,980
Sometimes the polar opposite you land on
for the joke is a horrible thing that 

1591
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:35,391
minimalizes the victim and every 
Catholic priests joke is somehow 

1592
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:39,351
minimalizing the victim part.
Comedy does that and I don't believe 

1593
01:11:39,351 --> 01:11:40,680
that it has to just be speaking truth to
power.

1594
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:45,681
I think that's part of it,
but I think that as long as your 

1595
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:48,000
intention is genuinely to be funny and 
not to humiliate a person for real,

1596
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:53,750
I think it's allowable and it has to be 
because it gets to be too subjective 

1597
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,750
after that.
Well,

1598
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,650
it's an art form and if you don't like 
that art form,

1599
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,680
I completely and totally understand that
you don't have to participate to 

1600
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:00,680
participate in the shelves.

1601
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,260
You don't have to go,
but when you're,

1602
01:12:02,261 --> 01:12:05,910
you're being hypercritical about and 
trying to get people to stop doing it,

1603
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:09,270
you're going to make it so that that art
form is not available.

1604
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,770
Like the really fucked up thing that you
don't mean art form is not available.

1605
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,450
Just like rap music.
I mean,

1606
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:18,600
what is going on in rap music or they're
really running around killing people and

1607
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:20,300
selling cocaine every day.
No,

1608
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,830
most of what they're doing is talking 
shit about something.

1609
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,290
It's no different than the movie 
scarface.

1610
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:27,500
Nobody really died in that movie.
Okay.

1611
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,130
You're,
you're painting a picture.

1612
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:31,020
It's a gross,
horrific picture,

1613
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,470
but some people like that.
They liked to watch scarface,

1614
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,560
that liked to listen to rap music.
They want to hear a dirty comic say 

1615
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,800
horrendous inappropriate things that are
fucked up.

1616
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,830
One of my favorites is Otto,
Otto and George.

1617
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:46,590
He would say some of the most fucked up.

1618
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:51,590
Ridiculous over the top shit,
but the reason why I did it is because 

1619
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:55,190
that's like what shocks us shit out of 
you and makes you laugh when you least 

1620
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:55,190
expect it.
And it was like,

1621
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:57,300
well crafted in,
on top of that.

1622
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,850
He made me laugh harder than anybody's 
ever made me laugh in a club.

1623
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:02,520
We were doing a pizzeria in Pennsylvania
and he said something.

1624
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:05,310
It was,
it was barbarism and it made me,

1625
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,100
it was because of the imagery.
It was such,

1626
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:08,850
it was,
it was,

1627
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,210
it was such poetry that he flew off the 
top with that.

1628
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:14,620
It was awful.
And uh,

1629
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,750
I've ever told you this story and it was
like,

1630
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,870
it won't hold,
like if I say it now,

1631
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:20,850
it's not gonna be the greatest jokey,
but the beauty of it,

1632
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,040
we were in a pizzeria.
It was an awful gig.

1633
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,500
And um,
it was,

1634
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,570
it was,
uh,

1635
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,400
it was like,
we're like real pizzeria bench seats.

1636
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,570
It stunk.
And uh,

1637
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,240
there was a bar next to it and I'm 
watching it.

1638
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:36,120
It was just up there fucking struggling 
and hitting it.

1639
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:41,690
And in the middle of this dirty act,
the bookers girlfriend walks down the 

1640
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,051
aisle with her seven year old son,
which was so inappropriate.

1641
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,210
And everybody looked at it,
just derails the show.

1642
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,330
And Auto,
uh,

1643
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,630
just said,
uh,

1644
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,260
you know,
because everyone looked at the fucking,

1645
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,660
the puppet addressed it and said,
oh,

1646
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:01,140
isn't,
isn't that cute.

1647
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,340
I'd like to grab him by the ankles and 
smashes Scotland to a fucking sink.

1648
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,330
And it was a caligula reference to the 
end of Caligula.

1649
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,980
And it made me the,
the,

1650
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,830
the,
the

1651
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,710
speed at which he put those words 
together.

1652
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,440
And the,
the,

1653
01:14:15,441 --> 01:14:18,300
the violence attached to that.
Uh,

1654
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,320
and the imagery of that,
I've never laughed harder than anything 

1655
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:23,830
anybody's ever said in a comedy club 
because I knew what had just happened is

1656
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:29,190
it was just,
I immediately saw the end of Caligula 

1657
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:29,980
where they grabbed the ankles and they 
smash the fucking head into the steps.

1658
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:35,220
And I'm like,
the genius to pull that out in this 

1659
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:35,220
moment and word it that quickly.
It just,

1660
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,100
it was,
it was,

1661
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,960
it was,
but it was beauty.

1662
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,820
But it was a horrible.
And nobody laughed.

1663
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:45,370
Of course they didn't affiliate 
pizzeria.

1664
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:50,550
Nobody understood how funny that was.
He had just said that and I hadn't seen 

1665
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,600
Caligula.
I might not have laughed as hard,

1666
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:55,450
but the fact that I immediately saw what
he did with it,

1667
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:57,820
I was just.
I wanted to hug them for that.

1668
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,200
I'm like,
you brilliant,

1669
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:01,000
brilliant guy.
He's a brilliant fuck man.

1670
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,970
He's a very funny guy and his style of 
comedy,

1671
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:08,971
much like dyson style of comedy is 
ridiculous over the top things.

1672
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:14,041
They don't really mean like dice has a 
some bit about about how a woman gets 

1673
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:16,810
pregnant and it's one of the most 
hilarious,

1674
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:21,811
ridiculous bits because it goes into 
like this medical or how you can make a 

1675
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:25,951
gay kid like how fucking so fucking 
ridiculous idiocy it's completed,

1676
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:30,970
but it's hilarious and for people to say
that that's a homophobic joke,

1677
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,610
know he doesn't believe he doesn't mean 
a word.

1678
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:35,650
He's saying,
do you understand that this is.

1679
01:15:35,651 --> 01:15:37,870
This is like an art piece that you're 
watching.

1680
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,650
This is just a ridiculous over the top 
art piece,

1681
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,820
and for you to say that it's not viewed 
to say that I shouldn't be enjoying it,

1682
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:50,970
well then we have to go with a fine 
tooth comb over virtually all of pop 

1683
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:51,700
culture,
every song.

1684
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:55,170
We have to find out what the true 
meaning behind movies are,

1685
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,340
what,
what's the implication on society?

1686
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,020
Because it can't just be humor.
It's this.

1687
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,930
It's a dumb way of looking at it 
because,

1688
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,690
you know,
it's a joke.

1689
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,820
If it's a standup comedy show,
you know,

1690
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:10,210
it's a fucking joke.
At least in that sense.

1691
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,690
There's no excuse with a rap music with 
a rap song.

1692
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:14,020
Like,
no,

1693
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:16,510
it's not a joke.
Maybe he's being serious with a movie.

1694
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:17,920
Maybe they're trying to promote that 
lifestyle.

1695
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,050
Maybe that's real.
It's a standup comedy show.

1696
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,040
The only reason why people are laughing 
is because it's a joke.

1697
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,330
Well,
people do know that,

1698
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,880
but it's unfunny people attempting to 
influence these people,

1699
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:31,240
trying to influence what you say.
It's like the same mentality and I don't

1700
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:36,241
mean individually like let's just say 
the same mentality that would target 

1701
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,570
dice or that would say,
um,

1702
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:42,580
you should get in trouble for a gay joke
are the exact same people who would 

1703
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,651
stand up and defend Maple Thorp,
that the same people who would defend 

1704
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:50,671
piss Christ and say that the national 
endowment of the arts should have paid 

1705
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:51,070
for piss Christ because who tell people 
what that is?

1706
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:51,500
It's,
it's,

1707
01:16:51,501 --> 01:16:52,020
it's,
it's,

1708
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:57,030
it's at the NDA and I think paid for it 
was an artist who pissed into a jar and 

1709
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,490
you put a crucifix in it and he called 
it piss Christ.

1710
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:02,910
Now,
I don't think that that's particularly 

1711
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:02,910
clever,
but it doesn't offend me on any level.

1712
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,740
And here's more inconsistency.
Is the same people clever.

1713
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,350
Yeah.
I mean it was,

1714
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:05,820
you know,
look,

1715
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:07,580
I wouldn't mind if I wish I would have 
thought of that.

1716
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:08,170
I mean,
I just,

1717
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:10,090
I couldn't fill the jar with my pis.
Would've been

1718
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,540
like two weeks.
Yeah.

1719
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:13,910
I really wasn't a big jar too.
It's very impressive.

1720
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,710
Yeah,
it's a very,

1721
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,860
it's a two kegger.
But,

1722
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:16,710
uh,
the fact that he,

1723
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:21,730
they,
they support that and they're the same 

1724
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:23,921
people who would have attacked Giuliani 
for going after the fucking Brooklyn 

1725
01:17:23,921 --> 01:17:25,670
Museum of art because that Guy Pin 
African artists painted,

1726
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,080
uh,
the Virgin Mary and Dung.

1727
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:30,260
So they would call him a fascist for 
that.

1728
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:31,500
Um,
you're,

1729
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,150
you're,
you're,

1730
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:37,210
you don't understand the art.
If you attack Maple Thorp and you don't 

1731
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:37,210
understand art,
if you attack piss Christ.

1732
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:37,670
However,
if you attack a common well,

1733
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:40,550
that comic is insensitive and he's 
saying something racially,

1734
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,620
racially insensitive or,
or gender intensive.

1735
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:44,540
And it shouldn't be.
It's inconsistency.

1736
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:47,750
You can't fucking respect if you can't 
acknowledge any of it with respect,

1737
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,900
it's people have to,
you have to leave room for art.

1738
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:56,020
And that sounds ridiculous when you're 
talking about Dick Jokes or any kind of 

1739
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:59,531
jokes,
but you have to leave room for art 

1740
01:17:59,531 --> 01:17:59,531
because that's what it is,
is just an art.

1741
01:17:59,531 --> 01:18:00,020
And if you don't appreciate that style 
of art,

1742
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:05,200
it's no different than you deciding to 
go to a metallica show and not liking 

1743
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,200
the lyrics.
Right?

1744
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,290
If you don't like it,
you don't have to like it.

1745
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:08,510
There's jody Mitchell's planned down the
block,

1746
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:09,350
go see that.
Go,

1747
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:14,351
go,
go see sheryl crow or go see Dave 

1748
01:18:14,351 --> 01:18:14,351
Matthews.
There's a lot of variety out there,

1749
01:18:14,351 --> 01:18:18,970
but at the end of the day,
it's something that someone creates and 

1750
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:18,970
when Otto says,
you know,

1751
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:23,441
I'd like to pick him up by his ankles 
and slammed his head into a sink and 

1752
01:18:23,441 --> 01:18:26,651
you're laughing.
That means he delivered art to the 

1753
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:29,380
person who likes that art and I feel the
same way when I.

1754
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,470
When I see,
look,

1755
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:32,600
when I saw dykes or when I saw you and 
Austin,

1756
01:18:32,601 --> 01:18:36,740
same feeling.
I enjoy ridiculous over the top humor.

1757
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,530
It's my one of my favorite things to 
watch.

1758
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,620
So when someone comes along and says,
you can't do jokes about violence 

1759
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,440
against children because it's fucked up.
Yes you can.

1760
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,910
Yes you can.
You can.

1761
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:50,540
Even if your kid killed it.
Well unfortunately for you,

1762
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:52,790
this one hit home and it's not fun to 
you,

1763
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,880
but everybody else doesn't have a kid 
that was killed by slamming their head 

1764
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,160
into a sink.
It becomes fun for them and it sucks,

1765
01:18:58,161 --> 01:19:02,600
but you can't just stop the art form 
because it's going to hit you and that's

1766
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:05,750
one of the things that came up in that 
conversation with Lindy Lindy,

1767
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:06,780
Lindy West,
Lindy West,

1768
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:12,430
one of the things that came up in the 
conversation with her was that she was 

1769
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:16,211
talking about rape jokes and meanwhile 
she had a photo on her twitter of Jeff 

1770
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:22,120
Goldbloom who was in death wish with a n
w who enacted a really horrific rape 

1771
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:26,300
scene at barbera grape signo.

1772
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,770
Scary,
terrifying.

1773
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,020
No joke.
There was no jokes involved.

1774
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,330
There was no hee hee,
ha ha,

1775
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,360
no double entendres,
and yet an actor doing that in that 

1776
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:41,180
piece of art somehow or another is 
exonerated from the impact and this idea

1777
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:43,970
that you should know that one third of 
the audience.

1778
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:47,660
I think the current thing they're 
enjoying banding about.

1779
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,880
When people talk about.
I shouldn't say they're enjoying,

1780
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:54,881
I don't want to dismiss it,
but the people who really believe this 

1781
01:19:54,881 --> 01:19:57,851
believe that one third of all women have
been either sexually assaulted or raped 

1782
01:19:57,851 --> 01:20:01,991
and there's people that dispute that and
there's a lot of it is based on a 

1783
01:20:01,991 --> 01:20:06,491
certain study from,
I believe it was 1987 and there was a 

1784
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:08,310
lot of questions that are very in that 
study,

1785
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:13,550
like they'd say if you ever had sex with
someone and then regretted it or do we 

1786
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:16,020
are coerced into having sex and things 
along those lines.

1787
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,050
They called all of those rates and so 
then I think,

1788
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:21,060
but I think their findings was like one 
in five,

1789
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:22,530
but now people are saying it's one and 
three,

1790
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,340
whatever the fuck it is.
The idea that you have to like not.

1791
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,120
You have to censor yourself because of 
the you can choose to.

1792
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:32,760
You can choose to if that's your style 
of comedy,

1793
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,880
you can choose to,
but for you to get mad at someone who 

1794
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:37,880
doesn't choose to.
It's like,

1795
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:37,970
Oh,
you're.

1796
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,520
This is a slippery slope and I know 
people don't think it's a slippery slope

1797
01:20:41,521 --> 01:20:44,700
because you think it's all just about 
protecting people's feelings,

1798
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:47,970
especially victim's feelings and I see 
your point,

1799
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:53,180
but at the end of the day we're going to
have to go over this whole motherfucker 

1800
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,960
with a fine tooth comb.
If you want to do that.

1801
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:00,080
You can't just single out standup comedy
because it's coming from one person and 

1802
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,621
not a giant movie where a woman gets 
assaulted and beaten or raped or 

1803
01:21:03,621 --> 01:21:04,950
whatever.
I mean all of it has to be looked at,

1804
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:06,390
but you have to look at the whole thing.

1805
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:09,470
See,
I and I also feel like I give myself the

1806
01:21:09,471 --> 01:21:11,690
same credit I give the audience like I 
really do,

1807
01:21:11,691 --> 01:21:16,691
and it's like we all say,
we want to just just treat people like 

1808
01:21:16,691 --> 01:21:16,691
you want to be treated well.
I treat the audience with the same level

1809
01:21:16,691 --> 01:21:21,581
of intellectual respect that I want.
And I went and saw Joan rivers and it's 

1810
01:21:21,581 --> 01:21:25,420
not.
It's the edgiest set I've ever seen a 

1811
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:25,850
comic do and I mean it's a few years ago
at the cutting room in New York.

1812
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,980
She's doing nine slash 11 jokes,
ai mean fucking brutal,

1813
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:36,430
and I was when I was,
I literally wanted to cry at the end of 

1814
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,570
it because I'm like,
that is what we should be doing.

1815
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:43,730
It is taking everything horrible that we
experienced and I mean horrible and 

1816
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:48,050
making a room full of people laugh about
it and when we walked out of there,

1817
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,280
my feelings about nine slash 11 had not 
changed my feelings about rape,

1818
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:56,350
my feelings about aids,
not one thing she said made me value 

1819
01:21:56,350 --> 01:22:00,461
those real experiences,
less not one thing she said made me 

1820
01:22:00,461 --> 01:22:02,090
devalue anything made me lose respect 
for the horror of nine.

1821
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Nothing changed for me other than I was 
able to temporarily laugh at something 

1822
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,961
that I knew was awful,
so why wouldn't I give my audience the 

1823
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:14,171
same credit for being able to come to 
the conclusion I came to watching Joan 

1824
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:14,171
rivers well

1825
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:15,420
to,
to take their argument.

1826
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:18,030
It would be because you haven't been 
raped,

1827
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:23,210
you haven't been murdered.
He didn't lose loved ones in nine slash 

1828
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,851
11 and that what you should be doing by 
omitting rape jokes is you should be 

1829
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,520
avoiding triggers.
You get ptsd triggers,

1830
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:32,490
avoiding people freaking out and 
thinking about the rape while they're at

1831
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:37,491
a comedy show.
Just try and have a good time and so 

1832
01:22:37,491 --> 01:22:39,651
their.
Their opinion is set up entirely to 

1833
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:42,891
protect the victims of these crimes.
It's not like a person like you has a 

1834
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:46,611
certain sensibility about nine slash 11.
Joan rivers defies that sensibility but 

1835
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:48,930
does it in a humorous way and you walk 
away with the same opinions that you had

1836
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:51,180
going in because that's not really what 
you're dealing with.

1837
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,820
You're dealing with is a victimization 
crime,

1838
01:22:53,821 --> 01:22:58,821
a crime or someone's been dehumanized 
and them being in the audience watching 

1839
01:22:58,821 --> 01:23:00,060
you talk about that.
You should be more sensitive than that.

1840
01:23:00,061 --> 01:23:05,061
So that's.
There are very good argument and a lot 

1841
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:05,061
of ways.

1842
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:06,490
My point back to them would.
I do understand

1843
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,420
that,
but like I said,

1844
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:09,640
whenever I talk about tiger woods,
his text messages,

1845
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:11,860
I reveal my own.
I talk about my own.

1846
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,710
I also talk about things that have 
injured me,

1847
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,160
talk about my own suicide attempts in my
own sexual proclivities like so.

1848
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:23,161
I include will you,
do you use certain things horrible and 

1849
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:24,520
things that have affected me and things 
that haven't.

1850
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:29,850
I don't.
It's not like I exclude things and if 

1851
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:29,850
you break down here,
we're like that.

1852
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:30,880
Like you said,
fine tooth comb.

1853
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:35,170
Every single joke or 90 percent of the 
jokes you do,

1854
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,690
unless you're talking about balloons are
bouncing a ball,

1855
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,630
have hurt somebody.
Well,

1856
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:41,350
he's talking about,
oh my God,

1857
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:42,880
was I drunk driving?
Oh my God.

1858
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:45,060
That's children being killed by drunk 
driving is not.

1859
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:50,061
But if we get that literal with humor 
than almost all jokes comics tell our 

1860
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:56,151
are going to be up for a,
a careful examination and I think matt 

1861
01:23:56,151 --> 01:23:58,360
and Trey said it's either all or none of
it's okay.

1862
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:03,630
I won't make pedophile jokes when Kevin 
fucking bacon can't play them in the 

1863
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,530
woodsmen I'll,
I won't do gun jokes when fuck it.

1864
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:07,540
Hollywood can't tell me how bad guns 
are.

1865
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,560
And then they make a movie called two 
guns with which I have no objection to,

1866
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:13,660
but then don't fucking preach to me 
about guns.

1867
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:15,990
Motherfuckers just,
you know,

1868
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,240
I don't care what you do as an artist,
leave me alone as an artist.

1869
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:20,800
I don't tell you what to do,
don't tell me what to do.

1870
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:22,200
That's all it is.
No,

1871
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,230
your point is dead on.
And it's a,

1872
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,310
it's a very important point.
The,

1873
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:28,720
uh,
the idea of censorship.

1874
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:33,870
I can understand that people don't want 
someone in the audience to be impacted 

1875
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:39,661
negatively about you making light of 
something that's a horrific crime that 

1876
01:24:39,661 --> 01:24:41,800
they've suffered from personally.
But that doesn't mean you should stop.

1877
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:47,460
Okay?
And it doesn't mean that you're a dick 

1878
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:47,460
either.
What it means is you're saying something

1879
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,841
that hits them personally and you know,
then maybe you shouldn't go see Jim 

1880
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:56,460
Norton.
And that sounds like a fucked up thing 

1881
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:56,460
to say.
But really that's,

1882
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,460
that's the reality of the situation.
This is what you're doing is a style of 

1883
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,420
art.
People who don't want to be scared don't

1884
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:03,430
go see the conjuring or the evil dead 
because they don't.

1885
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:08,431
Like I don't like horror movies.
How come nobody's trying to stop horror 

1886
01:25:08,431 --> 01:25:11,341
movies?
People that don't like them don't go to 

1887
01:25:11,341 --> 01:25:13,861
see them,
so the same way she'd be with certain 

1888
01:25:13,861 --> 01:25:14,020
types of humor and what's.
When you break it down,

1889
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:17,920
what's the worst that can happen if you 
see something like,

1890
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:22,921
am I going to talk about something that 
they don't show on law and order 

1891
01:25:22,921 --> 01:25:22,921
constantly?
Jesus,

1892
01:25:22,921 --> 01:25:23,710
the whole thing's a fucking rape murder 
fest.

1893
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,950
Everything people like it is a rape or a
murder or some kind of voyeurism and I 

1894
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:33,511
will acknowledge and honor people's a 
porn to violence.

1895
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:38,940
When does an accident in the southbound 
lane and the traffic in my lane doesn't 

1896
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:42,961
slow down.
People slow down to look because they 

1897
01:25:42,961 --> 01:25:46,591
want to see it.
They want to fucking see it on some 

1898
01:25:46,591 --> 01:25:49,531
level,
but they don't admit they want to see 

1899
01:25:49,531 --> 01:25:49,531
it.
And I hate their lack of admission.

1900
01:25:49,531 --> 01:25:50,980
Well,
there's a weird exclusion thing too.

1901
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:55,981
If you're.
You're discussing rape and you're not 

1902
01:25:55,981 --> 01:25:55,981
discussing murder.
You know,

1903
01:25:55,981 --> 01:26:00,060
if you have anything that involves a 
rape in a tweet or something,

1904
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:02,160
you're,
you're a piece of shit or you know,

1905
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:07,170
you should have had a tour,
a trigger warning in there like this is 

1906
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:07,170
the attitude that a lot of people are 
taking about this stuff,

1907
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:10,160
but why does it have,
why doesn't anybody have the same issues

1908
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:10,940
about murders?

1909
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,650
You can talk about a murder,
you can talk about like,

1910
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:19,320
no,
it's very rare that people get upset at 

1911
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,270
murder jokes or murder movies or 
anything murder.

1912
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:24,920
But there was a obama thing recently 
where Obama said that,

1913
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:29,921
uh,
he could have been trayvon Martin and I 

1914
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:29,921
said,
you know who else he could've been?

1915
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:31,460
It could've been a little kid that got 
killed by drones,

1916
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,830
right?
No,

1917
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,840
nobody.
Right.

1918
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,080
That's A.
I mean,

1919
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,400
it's not really a joke per se,
but it's,

1920
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:41,930
it's kind of like blocking him,
mocking the idiocy of this.

1921
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:46,280
But it's also bringing up murder.
It's bringing up people getting hit with

1922
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:47,990
missiles now.
Bodies exploding.

1923
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,090
Why is that image any less disturbing 
than the image of rape?

1924
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,460
Are they,
are they equally disturbing or they both

1925
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,190
off the menu or why are we only going 
with rape off the menu?

1926
01:26:58,191 --> 01:27:01,790
How come there's like zero push to take 
murder off the menu?

1927
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,290
Their argument with bb,
and again,

1928
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:05,390
this is what they would say is because 
rape,

1929
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,480
murder victims were people.
Murder,

1930
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:10,040
is that you're not taught to be silent 
about murder.

1931
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:15,550
You're taught to be silent about rape.
And there's a lot of rape victims who 

1932
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:18,761
are too scared to report the crime.
No one is scared to report a murder 

1933
01:27:18,761 --> 01:27:18,761
lists mob thing,
right?

1934
01:27:18,761 --> 01:27:20,960
They're saying the perception of the 
crime is different.

1935
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:26,230
And uh,
there's such a shame with it where 

1936
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:28,031
there's not ashamed with murder.
There's not ashamed with these other 

1937
01:27:28,031 --> 01:27:28,031
things.
And again,

1938
01:27:28,031 --> 01:27:31,550
I heard what she said and I listened to 
it and I did get it,

1939
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:37,330
but I won't.
I don't do a whole shitload of jokes on 

1940
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:37,330
rape victims anyway.
Um,

1941
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,640
but if that's the case,
and it probably is the case then be for 

1942
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,301
castration of rape rapists or were fight
the fact that the recidivism rate is so 

1943
01:27:46,301 --> 01:27:48,290
high in these fucking pigs because 
they're being.

1944
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:53,290
Let out of jail,
like fight that don't worry about with 

1945
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:56,080
dumb jokes,
contributing to a fucking rape culture 

1946
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,080
is nonsense and it is to say comedian 
contributes to rape culture is simply 

1947
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:03,190
bullshit and it's simplistic thinking.
It's a way of saying I don't like what 

1948
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:05,150
you're saying and I don't want you to 
say it,

1949
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:08,870
but I can't come out with that,
so I have to find a higher reason.

1950
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:11,120
Which makes it sound like you shouldn't 
say it for this reason.

1951
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,370
Well,
even the term rape culture,

1952
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:15,190
you know,
someone in my message bird said,

1953
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,660
do they have meetings?
They have a magazine.

1954
01:28:17,661 --> 01:28:19,540
Like is it really a culture?
Like what?

1955
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:22,250
What are you talking about?
And by calling it that,

1956
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:26,120
by defining it in those terms,
we're calling it rape culture.

1957
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:31,240
You would you put quotes around that it 
starts to be real and what I don't mean 

1958
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,270
that it's going to encourage people to 
rape,

1959
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:37,420
but I mean the idea that there's a 
culture that supports rape is going to 

1960
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:41,141
be real.
It's going to be something that people 

1961
01:28:41,141 --> 01:28:41,660
address as if it's real.
Regardless of whether or not it is,

1962
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,240
is it real that people rape?
Absolutely,

1963
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:46,250
but it isn't real that our culture 
supports it.

1964
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,040
Fuck no man,
of course that most people have moms.

1965
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,930
Most people have sisters.
What we,

1966
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:55,990
what we have a problem with in this 
country is a lot of people are making 

1967
01:28:55,990 --> 01:29:00,011
shitty human beings.
There's a lot of terrible fucking 

1968
01:29:00,011 --> 01:29:02,771
parents are doing a shitty job and then 
making shitty human beings and they're 

1969
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:02,771
also

1970
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:07,070
raising these shitty human rings around 
a bunch of other kids that were created 

1971
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:11,181
by shitty human beings and they don't 
know what the fuck they're doing either 

1972
01:29:11,181 --> 01:29:11,181
and no one's paying attention to their 
kids.

1973
01:29:11,181 --> 01:29:15,711
Making a human being and raising a human
being is a massive undertaking and all 

1974
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:17,460
the people out there that are doing 
their best.

1975
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:22,610
I commend you and congratulate you.
All the parents out there that are 

1976
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:27,111
taking their kid to wrestling classes 
and martial arts and their daughter to 

1977
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:28,410
dance classes or martial arts if she 
wants to do it or anything.

1978
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,430
Were you getting them involved in 
activities D,

1979
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,360
building discipline,
disciplining them,

1980
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:37,080
developing their character.
Most people don't get that in this life,

1981
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,120
right?
They don't get taught how to behave,

1982
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:44,270
how to be a good human being,
the qualities and the values of 

1983
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:47,331
friendship and community that should be 
bestowed upon children at a very early 

1984
01:29:47,331 --> 01:29:48,600
age,
but for most of us,

1985
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,070
we have to get the fuck out of the house
for.

1986
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:54,240
We can even figure out that on our own 
and we figured it out by friendships and

1987
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:57,120
we figured it out by meeting people in 
life and learning from them,

1988
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,160
but we're doing a real shit job of 
raising kids right out of the box and so

1989
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:07,161
you come into life with a deficit and 
that deficit manifests itself in a bunch

1990
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:12,351
of Shitty fucking behavior.
Whether it's violence or whether it's 

1991
01:30:12,351 --> 01:30:12,570
rape,
whether it's stealing,

1992
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:14,580
whether it's,
whether it's plagiarism,

1993
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:19,760
whether it's a,
whether it's taking advantage of of of 

1994
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:20,250
people in any way like what are you 
doing?

1995
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:25,251
Like why you doing that?
Why are you being such a shitty human 

1996
01:30:25,251 --> 01:30:26,100
being?
And that's what is not emphasized enough

1997
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,780
in our culture.
It's not about.

1998
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:30,600
It's not just about making money.
It's not about getting ahead.

1999
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,440
It's about cultivating good friendships 
and a happy life,

2000
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,510
and the only way you could do that is to
be nice.

2001
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,270
Those motherfuckers that are ruthless 
businessman,

2002
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:44,420
those guys are all depressed.
They're all a bunch of fucking crazy 

2003
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:47,740
assholes.
Taken Ambien to go to sleep abused and 

2004
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,090
hookers and others.
Hey,

2005
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,500
easy.
You know what I'm talking about?

2006
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,840
Most of them had their throats cut like 
honestly,

2007
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:56,841
I think that.
I think that would change a little bit 

2008
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:56,841
if we dragged a few of those business 
guys.

2009
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:59,900
Not all of them,
but a few of them into the street and 

2010
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,341
killed him in the street.
I think that they would stop stealing 

2011
01:31:01,341 --> 01:31:01,341
people's money.
Yeah.

2012
01:31:01,341 --> 01:31:02,730
There's a ton of pens.
I'm going to go push yourself.

2013
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:07,290
Literally piss out of your pants.
I like to play a game.

2014
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:08,580
The commercials?
Yeah.

2015
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:11,640
These posts,
these little 15 minute radio.

2016
01:31:11,641 --> 01:31:13,190
Bladder.
Yeah.

2017
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:18,200
We used to holding it for three hours 
while drinking [inaudible] coconut 

2018
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:18,200
juice.
That's right.

2019
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:18,420
CTO,
coach boundaries.

2020
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:20,410
People say,
why are you drinking tea too?

2021
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,230
I'll tell you why.
This is not a commercial.

2022
01:31:22,231 --> 01:31:24,480
They don't pay me anything,
but they send me coconut juice.

2023
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,520
It's really good because it's from Thai 
coconuts.

2024
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:28,020
A lot of you have had coconut juice and 
you're like,

2025
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,430
oh my God,
this stuff tastes like ass.

2026
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,760
You're right.
A lot of it tastes like ass Thai 

2027
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:34,760
coconuts,
a different animal.

2028
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,301
It's short.
It's only like five feet tall and it 

2029
01:31:38,301 --> 01:31:41,570
grows and it's like,
it's almost like a Bush two totally 

2030
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:41,570
different thing.
You know,

2031
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:41,570
you think of those long,
tall ones.

2032
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,650
The coconut to the top,
those aren't so good.

2033
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:45,710
But then the Thai coconuts.
Oh,

2034
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:46,970
that's sweet.
Oh yeah.

2035
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,420
It's so great.
So like if you're hung over,

2036
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:52,530
he are you when you wake up in the 
morning and just like dehydrated.

2037
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:58,570
Yeah.
I found out from my friend Ed when 

2038
01:31:58,570 --> 01:32:00,050
Jujitsu came in and brought a case of 
this shit and started handing it out to 

2039
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:00,050
people and I'll go,
what is this?

2040
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,980
I never had had coconut juice.
It was gross,

2041
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,230
but you know it's the best shit.
Yeah,

2042
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:12,310
that's my thing where they chop off the 
top and you have a little good to eat a 

2043
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,080
little of the skin,
scoop it out with a spoon.

2044
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:19,110
That's the best.
If you can just hack the top off of a 

2045
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:19,110
delicious coconut and get a straw in 
that bitch.

2046
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,560
You know what's weird?
I,

2047
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:21,450
I just found it,
you know,

2048
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:26,460
I talked to,
I think we talked about this last 

2049
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:26,460
podcast and we talked briefly talked 
about it today.

2050
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:30,920
Uh,
I just found out like the blue 

2051
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,640
cigarettes,
the one that we always talk about with 

2052
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,130
that one dude in it,
you know that a sexy guy that's smoking 

2053
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:35,130
the fake cigarette,
Stephen Dorff,

2054
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:39,520
that company blue is owned by the third 
largest tobacco company.

2055
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,150
Oh,
there you go.

2056
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:43,690
And then the second largest just bought 
a new company.

2057
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:45,730
Uh,
and that's what their thing is now.

2058
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:48,280
That's the way they're hit hooking the 
kids on nicotine.

2059
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:51,220
Now we have these fake cigarettes with 
the cool blue lights.

2060
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:56,221
I mean,
making all flavored soup tastes like 

2061
01:32:56,221 --> 01:32:56,790
watermelon.
So now that's how they're getting there.

2062
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,080
They're getting you again and then 
they're making it better.

2063
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:04,081
Now the kids are,
I know somebody that just got one of 

2064
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:04,081
these cigarettes and she's like,
I quit smoking.

2065
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:04,180
I'm like,
oh,

2066
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:05,400
that's great.
And I was like,

2067
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:06,010
what do you got?
Well,

2068
01:33:06,011 --> 01:33:07,210
I got one of these electronic 
cigarettes.

2069
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:12,450
She sat there.
I watched her for probably like five 

2070
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,701
hours nonstop.
Just sucking on that thing like it was 

2071
01:33:14,701 --> 01:33:15,880
air and those batteries.
It's pretty impressive.

2072
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,450
Yeah,
those battery lasts pretty well.

2073
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:18,310
What?
The rechargeable.

2074
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:19,990
And they even have like little USB 
plugs.

2075
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:23,260
So they seem like a cool technology toy 
box.

2076
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:23,770
I've seen them.

2077
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:26,110
They have like a metal box or a plastic 
box,

2078
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:28,180
so they charge it in.
Some of them.

2079
01:33:28,181 --> 01:33:29,410
Some of them,
like the ones that,

2080
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:31,870
the one I have actually has this thing 
he just hook up.

2081
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:34,270
It has a USB cable and hook up to your,
uh,

2082
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,220
the Jenny Mccarthy one that she's 
pitching.

2083
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,920
She's got the opposite of the Stephen 
Dorff commercial.

2084
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:40,260
What are we doing?
We're doing blue commercial.

2085
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:41,500
She's fucking people.
I was,

2086
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:45,850
I was the gathering of the Juggalos.
Did you do anything crazy happen when?

2087
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:46,510
No,
it was,

2088
01:33:46,511 --> 01:33:51,511
it's funny.
Those guys off my cpa have been really 

2089
01:33:51,511 --> 01:33:52,570
nice to me and I was hesitant to do that
gig because I hear it's like,

2090
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:54,250
you know,
you're in the woods.

2091
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,900
Oh yeah.
I have never watched this.

2092
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:57,640
I can't watch myself.
What was this?

2093
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:59,770
This was a TV show,
right show on fuse.

2094
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:02,190
I was one of the first interviews 
they've done confused.

2095
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:07,260
What is it?
Where they just watched videos and kind 

2096
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:07,260
of mock them a second beavis and 
butthead thing.

2097
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,830
They smashed you in between them.
This is what uncomfortably close?

2098
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,470
Yeah,
that's part of it to make.

2099
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:15,610
Yeah.
I think I was one of the first 

2100
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:15,610
interviews I ever did.
Why did they want to touch you like that

2101
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:15,670
while they're sitting there?
I don't know.

2102
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:19,360
I think it was just for camera framing.
That was a shitty job of camera framing.

2103
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:21,280
They just block us all in there.
Ridiculous.

2104
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,540
That's like,
who's the,

2105
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:27,570
who's the cousin?
I think that they just liked the 

2106
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:27,570
uncomfortability.
I like the fact that just really weird.

2107
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:28,870
Yeah.
But together can I,

2108
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:33,871
uh,
about the gathering of the Juggalos was 

2109
01:34:33,871 --> 01:34:36,310
for the travel to it is an abomination,
but it was a really good gig and that 

2110
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,580
there's like 700 people in a tent.
I mean they were nice.

2111
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:44,880
They were a little bit chatty,
but nowhere near what you'd expected an 

2112
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,930
outdoor festival gig.
Like I loved them and they will no 

2113
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:49,390
fucking nice.
Um,

2114
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:54,510
one of my favorite porn girls was there 
because she's a big fan of them and I 

2115
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:54,510
got the seizure favorite porn girl.
She's one of them.

2116
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:58,981
I hadn't.
Is Pepper Kester you go deep to the 

2117
01:34:58,981 --> 01:34:58,981
bottom

2118
01:34:58,981 --> 01:35:00,420
of the obscure Pornstar redhead,
right?

2119
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:01,910
Yeah.
Big really big pussy lips.

2120
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:03,690
I want to fucking,
I want to just,

2121
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:06,140
I want to wear a pussy on my fucking 
nose.

2122
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,700
She was there.
She was there.

2123
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:10,130
She's a big fan of them yet.
So that was the highlight.

2124
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,160
You get her back to hang out with 
friends?

2125
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,400
No,
we don't do anything.

2126
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:14,140
She does.
Mostly I,

2127
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:16,100
but I understand that she does mostly 
lesbian porn.

2128
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,410
I have no shot at fucking or um,
but,

2129
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:20,330
but I still like,
I genuinely like her.

2130
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,410
She's cool.
So.

2131
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,140
Well there'll be no sexual and she 
doesn't mind you beat off thinking about

2132
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:24,770
her.
Oh no,

2133
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:26,530
she's fine with it.
I'm trying,

2134
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,640
I'm trying to work her up or I can walk 
behind her and beat off.

2135
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:33,740
Had she said she'd been listening to the
ONA about you talking about or has he 

2136
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:33,860
said anything about that?

2137
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,230
People tweet her and she's happy that we
do,

2138
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,730
but I've had dinner with her once and 
again,

2139
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:40,790
but I knew it was just going to be a 
hang and she was actually really nice.

2140
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:41,930
So that was cool.
I,

2141
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,040
uh,
can I plug my specials?

2142
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:44,900
I keep forgetting.
I'm going to go ahead.

2143
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:45,760
I'm going to take a look.
Go ahead.

2144
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,800
Playboy.
It's called American degenerate and it 

2145
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,590
premieres on epics on uh,
this month,

2146
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:53,400
August the 23rd.
And uh,

2147
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:54,260
yeah,
I'm looking all over.

2148
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:56,060
What an unprofessional.
How to look at the camera.

2149
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,930
Am I looking at the wrong one right 
here.

2150
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:58,960
There's,
there's the uh,

2151
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:04,350
oh,
they're showing them talking and it's 

2152
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:04,350
August 23rd.
It's on Epix.

2153
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:05,780
And if you don't have that because it's 
epics hd.com

2154
01:36:05,781 --> 01:36:08,120
and you can get a free trial 
subscription.

2155
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:11,330
So whether or not you want to keep epics
is up to you,

2156
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,360
but get the trial subscription online 
and then you can watch it whenever you 

2157
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:16,360
want.

2158
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,340
But I'm actually really happy with it.
Um,

2159
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,090
is this something that you're going to 
eventually like,

2160
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:21,030
do you own this?
I do.

2161
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,760
Only you can sell it.
I will,

2162
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:23,500
yeah.
Cool.

2163
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:26,900
But I want people to go and see it there
because epics gave me money to do it and

2164
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:31,901
they artistically got out of my way.
There are amazing as far as for a 

2165
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:35,231
comedian,
the only thing you could do better than 

2166
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:36,770
with them as a network is just do it and
shoot it yourself and put it on your own

2167
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:39,590
tv because they're very,
very good about leaving you alone,

2168
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:43,130
which is a lot of comedian wants us to 
be left the fuck alone from a network.

2169
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:45,050
I know that Sam Roberts is in town right
now.

2170
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,740
You guys are going to get to hook up and
do anything when he,

2171
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:49,130
I think he's coming into tonight.

2172
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:51,200
I probably won't see him.
I'm just too busy.

2173
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:54,440
I'm doing a bunch of shit today and a 
bunch of shit tomorrow.

2174
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:56,060
And then I go home.
Uh,

2175
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,250
and Wednesday I'm very,
very busy every day.

2176
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:03,640
But I came out and I want it because 
it'll be on Netflix and like eight 

2177
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:06,401
months.
But I legitimately wanted to do promo 

2178
01:37:06,401 --> 01:37:09,221
for,
for this network because they've taken 

2179
01:37:09,221 --> 01:37:09,290
good care of me and you don't get many 
people like that anymore.

2180
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:11,260
That give you the fucking freedom,
you know,

2181
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:16,300
because every network person wants to 
get their hands on your business and 

2182
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,060
they don't do that.
What for you and your special for epics?

2183
01:37:17,061 --> 01:37:18,380
Yeah,
they've been really good about it,

2184
01:37:18,381 --> 01:37:19,850
man.
And I'm the opening.

2185
01:37:19,851 --> 01:37:24,851
They were little heads.
I got an opening which I was really 

2186
01:37:24,851 --> 01:37:26,801
happy.
Like I got someone special for my 

2187
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:26,801
opening and they were a little like,
uh,

2188
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:26,801
but uh,
you know,

2189
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:29,510
it wound up working out and they left me
alone and they were happy with it.

2190
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:31,370
Who's on your opening?
I don't want to say I'll show.

2191
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:34,490
I'll show it to you.
It's a secret.

2192
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:36,020
Jimmy and I,
I should,

2193
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:41,021
uh,
because last year I had ozzie do it and 

2194
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:41,021
ozzy and Sharon both tweeted like,
they really helped me out.

2195
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:41,940
Oh that's awesome.
But this one,

2196
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:43,160
Jonathan,
if you're listening,

2197
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:48,161
could you email it to me?
I'll email it to joke because I have 

2198
01:37:48,161 --> 01:37:48,161
not.
Uh,

2199
01:37:48,161 --> 01:37:48,161
no one has seen it,
like for people that have seen it,

2200
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:50,180
I don't mean like that's big,
special secret.

2201
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:51,130
Nobody gives a fuck.
But I mean,

2202
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,610
I just haven't it.
I understand.

2203
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:54,440
You don't want to let out the secret.
You've got a secret.

2204
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:55,710
You create,
you crafted something.

2205
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:56,140
Put together

2206
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:01,140
a little secret.
I'm going to use it to promote the 

2207
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,581
special.
It's nice it epics is not fucking with 

2208
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:02,581
you and letting you do whatever you 
want.

2209
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:02,581
That's the only way to do it.
It's,

2210
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:03,360
I,
I've done.

2211
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:06,390
I tried before I ever did my first 
comedy central special.

2212
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,500
Why was on spike first?
Actually,

2213
01:38:08,501 --> 01:38:10,020
no,
it was on comedy central,

2214
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:14,430
but before that there was a round I went
where they went over some of my material

2215
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:15,600
and then be like,
no,

2216
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,730
you can't say this now you can't say 
that.

2217
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:21,480
This is no good.
You can't even beat that out like this.

2218
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:22,530
It just,
it got to be like,

2219
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:23,490
all right,
we can't do this.

2220
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:27,150
It's too frustrating to have to have to 
have all that stuff.

2221
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:28,120
Uh,
they,

2222
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:31,080
they didn't have any content issue like 
live.

2223
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,570
As long as you're not slandering 
somebody or liable,

2224
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:36,280
whichever is the spoken word,
like you know,

2225
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:36,990
you got to be careful.

2226
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:39,150
You can't walk up and just say things 
that are going to get you sued.

2227
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,840
That's the only thing they care.
Like they were like fine with it.

2228
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,010
They were very hands off and that's 
beautiful.

2229
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,390
It's.
Yeah,

2230
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,630
it was refreshing.
Well,

2231
01:38:45,631 --> 01:38:47,250
you know what it is Jimmy.
I think that this,

2232
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:52,320
this the same thing that we were talking
about how there's a broad spectrum of 

2233
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:57,050
art that people like,
whether it's music or movies or 

2234
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:59,811
whatever.
There's also a broad spectrum of of 

2235
01:38:59,811 --> 01:39:03,000
content distribution methods and the one
that we've all been stuck with.

2236
01:39:03,001 --> 01:39:06,090
It was television,
15 minutes commercial,

2237
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:11,110
another 15 minutes commercial.
All these fucking commercials and all 

2238
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:14,631
these breaks and all this editing and 
all this censorship and all this shit 

2239
01:39:14,631 --> 01:39:19,041
they're trying to sell in between and 
Toyota cars and tide detergent and all 

2240
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:22,590
this shit that they're doing it other 
than the actual performance itself.

2241
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:25,390
Then all of a sudden the internet comes 
along and then like Louis,

2242
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:25,770
c,
k,

2243
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:28,290
did you release it all?
You sell it for five bucks,

2244
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:29,880
you watched the whole thing,
it's an entirety,

2245
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,380
and then you go,
well,

2246
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:33,480
why would I ever,
why would I ever fucking do it any other

2247
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:38,481
way?
Why would I try to listen to a bunch of 

2248
01:39:38,481 --> 01:39:41,901
other people try to shape it and then 
put sandwich commercials in it and then 

2249
01:39:41,901 --> 01:39:45,591
sensor it.
It's like it's such a shitty way of 

2250
01:39:45,591 --> 01:39:45,591
distributing content.
Yeah,

2251
01:39:45,591 --> 01:39:45,591
and if became can't,
you're right.

2252
01:39:45,591 --> 01:39:47,730
The only way we knew was that it's all 
we ever had.

2253
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,760
Now there's a new way and Louis changed 
a lot of things because the networks 

2254
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,460
realize that they have a certain amount 
of power still,

2255
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,290
but that is slipping and slipping.
I don't think.

2256
01:39:56,310 --> 01:40:00,610
I think you could do an online special 
if you wanted to identity.

2257
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:01,110
Oh,
you did?

2258
01:40:01,111 --> 01:40:03,480
Okay.
So my last one was totally online.

2259
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,860
I did it on,
I paid for it,

2260
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:09,000
did it online and then sold it to comedy
central comedy central now and I'm going

2261
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:13,440
to do another one and I'm going to do it
the same way and it's like Louis said,

2262
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,720
a perfect bar too,
so nobody can get greedy.

2263
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:17,220
You know,
because you know,

2264
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:21,600
Louise,
like top shelf a plus standup comic,

2265
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,080
one of the greatest step,
you know,

2266
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:28,310
of our generation without a doubt,
like between him and rock and Chappelle 

2267
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:29,310
was like four or five people that have 
the greatest of our generation.

2268
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,520
So if he puts up a $5 special,
that's what it costs now everybody's 

2269
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:38,730
going to do five bucks now because if 
somebody stepped up first and try to do 

2270
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:39,030
20 and then if it,
you know,

2271
01:40:39,031 --> 01:40:41,430
it would have been one of those things 
like kind of what do I price it at?

2272
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:46,730
He made it a super reasonable.
It wasn't just that he was the pioneer 

2273
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:49,911
and doing the first one like this,
but also that he set the bar as far as 

2274
01:40:49,911 --> 01:40:50,360
like the,
uh,

2275
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:50,900
the,
the,

2276
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:53,500
the expense.
He said it really reasonably.

2277
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:53,970
Yeah.
And there's

2278
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,110
very smart,
very smart to do that.

2279
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,650
Like that.
It's good.

2280
01:40:57,690 --> 01:41:00,340
And it's also when you cut out all the 
other bullshit,

2281
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,790
like as far as like,
he cut out all the other bullshit as far

2282
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:07,180
as like networks and commercials and 
putting them on,

2283
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:07,990
you know,
the uh,

2284
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:12,991
the amount of production money that has 
to be paid off by commercials and all 

2285
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:17,551
that jazz.
When we take all that out of the 

2286
01:41:17,551 --> 01:41:19,621
equation,
it's like pretty easy to get your money 

2287
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:19,621
back,
you know,

2288
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:22,470
you have to sell that much to get your 
money back and then it becomes 

2289
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:22,470
profitable.
Well,

2290
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:24,040
unless you're dealing with one of these 
fucking networks or production companies

2291
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:28,420
that want to sneak in a 30 percent a 
distribution fee on top of everything,

2292
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,610
they fucked so many guys doing that.
Well.

2293
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:31,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

2294
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:36,090
Like you get some back end money but 
they don't tell you that the 30 percent 

2295
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:36,090
distribution fee,
which is a vague,

2296
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,470
you're paying a vague comes off.

2297
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,420
So it's like,
well we made $100 but no,

2298
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:42,760
we only made 70 because it's 30 percent 
distribution becomes other.

2299
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:43,630
And like,
what's it for?

2300
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:44,990
Well it's just the distribution of it.
It's,

2301
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:48,730
it's a nonexistent fucking thing.
So you know,

2302
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:53,350
it's nice to be on my own with this one 
and I own it and epics is leasing it and

2303
01:41:53,351 --> 01:41:58,351
they were amazing about well you're,
you're on serious and you guys are on 

2304
01:41:58,351 --> 01:42:00,650
five days a week or some time Monday 
through Friday,

2305
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:01,540
Monday through Friday.
Now.

2306
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,850
Do you ever think about doing something 
on your own?

2307
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,490
Do you see like in the time that you're 
on,

2308
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:11,850
like you guys were one of the first on 
Sirius satellite radio and you know,

2309
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:17,160
in my opinion like that move that where 
we got shifted over to Sirius Satellite 

2310
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:21,010
Radio that changed a lot of like 
people's ideas of how to do a radio show

2311
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:26,190
because between you guys and Stern,
all of a sudden we heard swearing on a 

2312
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:28,330
regular basis on a radio show and it 
became brewer brewer show,

2313
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:29,890
brewer unleashed.

2314
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,860
You got to hear like people just hanging
out.

2315
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:36,850
And then I think that is what gave birth
to a lot of podcasts.

2316
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,210
But you don't do a podcast.
No lie.

2317
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:40,090
You know what it is?
I get,

2318
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:43,420
I get 20 hours a week with those guys 
and we replay all day.

2319
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,910
I have five nights a week on Ozzy's 
boneyard.

2320
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:50,911
I hearst,
I hosted music show and I do my own 

2321
01:42:50,911 --> 01:42:50,911
advice show once a week on Wednesdays 
for an hour a week.

2322
01:42:50,911 --> 01:42:51,950
You do bone yards?
Yeah,

2323
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,960
but it's only again,
you know,

2324
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:54,070
you pre tape it,
but yeah,

2325
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:59,071
I mean my voice is heard five nights a 
week on butter and get the one hour 

2326
01:42:59,071 --> 01:42:59,620
advice.
Shall I love?

2327
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,300
Unwise.
That's actually some of the most fun.

2328
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,530
Thank you man.
I love doing that.

2329
01:43:02,531 --> 01:43:07,531
So.
But my voice is heard a lot and I'm 

2330
01:43:07,531 --> 01:43:11,371
freed up to do my standup,
which is what I want to do and I have 

2331
01:43:11,371 --> 01:43:12,610
two shows that I want to get on the air.

2332
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:16,120
That's my new obsession.
So one talk show and I have one scripted

2333
01:43:16,121 --> 01:43:19,420
show which I actually think is good and 
I'm ultra critical.

2334
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:24,430
My Shit and I always think it stinks but
like I'm actually happy with this so 

2335
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:25,930
hopefully I'll be able to get it sold or
do it online.

2336
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:27,130
I'm just not big enough to do it online 
yet.

2337
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:29,730
I hope you never leave Ona,
but if you ever did leave on a,

2338
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:31,720
you would have a gigantic fucking 
podcast.

2339
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:36,780
I don't know.
I feel like I wouldn't and I mean maybe 

2340
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:36,780
I would,
but I feel like,

2341
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:36,780
uh,
I would be like,

2342
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:39,130
Eh,
I'll be afraid to do that.

2343
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:44,131
Man.
I love interviewing people that are 

2344
01:43:44,131 --> 01:43:44,131
like,
I love doing it,

2345
01:43:44,131 --> 01:43:47,460
but I'm said East Coast podcast man,
they just don't trust podcast on the 

2346
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,451
east coast.
The only one I got spoiled with radio 

2347
01:43:51,451 --> 01:43:51,451
because I'm so used to doing it that 
way,

2348
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:51,980
that,

2349
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,570
uh,
to do it on my own.

2350
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,600
I love your set up here.
You have a bigger studio that we do and 

2351
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,330
I love the way you've got to set up and 
it's a great hang and it's well done.

2352
01:43:59,450 --> 01:43:59,970
Yeah.
Well,

2353
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
this place I just had realized that 
somewhere along the line I was 

2354
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,000
eventually going to have to do 
something.

2355
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,970
So I found this office space and just 
over the course of a few months put it 

2356
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:13,631
together,
but it's really only become functional 

2357
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:15,820
over the last few months because for the
longest time we had a terrible Internet 

2358
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:15,820
connection.
It's a pain the Deq to build something.

2359
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,360
Sure,
sure.

2360
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,100
We had to get a fat pipe put in here,
so it's like 100 megabytes up and down.

2361
01:44:20,101 --> 01:44:25,101
It's a tremendous Internet connection,
so now we can stream and like easy with 

2362
01:44:25,101 --> 01:44:29,021
no hiccups,
download things at ridiculous speeds 

2363
01:44:29,021 --> 01:44:29,300
before we were like crippled with a 
shitty DSL connection.

2364
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,520
There's a lot of things that go into 
building.

2365
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:33,890
One of these things are hiring people to
build these things,

2366
01:44:33,891 --> 01:44:36,860
but it's cool to do because it's cool to
like make it your way.

2367
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:38,060
Like,
I want a brick behind me.

2368
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:39,080
Okay,
let's make it bricks.

2369
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,750
I want a werewolf in the lobby.
Okay.

2370
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:41,480
Right.
Well,

2371
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,730
you know,
I want to.

2372
01:44:42,731 --> 01:44:45,320
Oh,
oak wall or Oak table that's made out of

2373
01:44:45,321 --> 01:44:49,190
100 year old reprocessed farm wood or 
reclaimed barn wood.

2374
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,410
So you can do shit like that because 
it's yours.

2375
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:56,460
Yeah.
Because you don't have to go through a 

2376
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:56,460
bunch of producers like,
well we want is the.

2377
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:00,160
You see this thing behind me.
This goofy fucking fell in love that is 

2378
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,450
created by producers.
I want one of these things on the wall,

2379
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:05,120
these black things that look like a 
swastika.

2380
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:09,440
They were claiming that people are 
claiming that they're supposed to go.

2381
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,160
I don't mind it though.
You know what?

2382
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:16,730
It doesn't hurt the room at all.
I think the whole setup here is great 

2383
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:16,730
man.
And uh,

2384
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:18,320
I will be too nervous to do my own 
podcast.

2385
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,280
Oh,
you're so crazy.

2386
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:20,800
You'd be awesome at it.
And I dunno,

2387
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,760
I,
I bore myself a lot.

2388
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:27,790
Like I hate listening to myself unless 
I'm doing uncle Paul then it doesn't 

2389
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:28,760
sound like me at all and I can listen to
it.

2390
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:31,070
Well that is the problem with doing like
a lot of hours,

2391
01:45:31,071 --> 01:45:36,071
right?
You do a lot of hours on the radio and 

2392
01:45:36,071 --> 01:45:36,071
after awhile you're like,
God damn it.

2393
01:45:36,071 --> 01:45:39,431
I don't have.
I think that sometimes we do three in a 

2394
01:45:39,431 --> 01:45:39,431
week.
We do three,

2395
01:45:39,431 --> 01:45:39,650
three hour shows in a week I'll be like,
yeah,

2396
01:45:39,651 --> 01:45:41,540
we have,
but after like three,

2397
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:44,030
like three is where I feel like I don't 
want to hear me anymore,

2398
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,530
you know,
I'm tired of me.

2399
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,440
So you must be tired of me to know.
It's,

2400
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:49,610
yeah,
it's 20 hours a week we do and uh,

2401
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:50,570
you know,
again,

2402
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:53,180
it's draining sometimes,
but it's also fun,

2403
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:58,210
but it's also developed your 
conversation skills and that's one of 

2404
01:45:58,210 --> 01:46:00,500
the reasons why I really enjoy you like 
in that a lindy west thing.

2405
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,600
It was,
it was a fascinating debate.

2406
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:07,601
You were the perfect person for that 
because you're so succinct with your 

2407
01:46:07,601 --> 01:46:10,571
words.
You're so used to being involved in 

2408
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:11,810
disagreements with people that you were,
you know,

2409
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:16,811
how to keep things civil no matter what.
Like one of my favorite disagreements 

2410
01:46:16,811 --> 01:46:20,591
with you was the Jesse Ventura one.
Jesse Ventura got all dickie with you 

2411
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,820
and he,
he tried to get like,

2412
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:27,910
he tried to get abusive,
he tried to get like put his hand on 

2413
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:27,910
you.
He tried to bully you a little bit,

2414
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:29,420
a little bit and you called him out on 
it and it was,

2415
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:31,070
it was really interesting.
Yeah,

2416
01:46:31,071 --> 01:46:32,900
it's weird.
Like I'm much more likely,

2417
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:34,610
like you said,
you don't like to see weak people.

2418
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:35,640
I don't like it either.
Like,

2419
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:40,660
I'm much more likely to argue with a guy
who could throw me through a wall and 

2420
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,020
it's not a little man complex.
It's just,

2421
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,870
I don't like when Paris Hilton was in,
she was not a good guest.

2422
01:46:44,871 --> 01:46:46,880
She's a Vapid jazz bagging.
Hated her,

2423
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:50,040
but she wasn't being vicious eyesight.
It's

2424
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,630
just too easy to attack her.
Right,

2425
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:56,680
right.
She gives a fuck if I do Jesse then 

2426
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,041
sure.
I did not want to have this interaction 

2427
01:46:59,041 --> 01:46:59,041
with.
I would have preferred it to be civil.

2428
01:46:59,041 --> 01:47:00,860
But uh,
the video does not tell the whole story.

2429
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,150
The audio tells the whole story.
But the video because opiates,

2430
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:08,160
so ocd and nuts,
he didn't take all of the taped like 

2431
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,940
when it started to get heated.
But Jessie was more aggressive with me 

2432
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:12,000
and uh,
you know,

2433
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,820
when he patted me on the way out,
I knew he wasn't trying to hurt me.

2434
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:20,150
But again,
the way for me to equal him was to pat 

2435
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:20,200
him and he was fucking sick.

2436
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:22,910
Why you want to go back that far with 
the Kennedy?

2437
01:47:22,911 --> 01:47:25,790
We can't go back to Vietnam.
You said to me were with those guys.

2438
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:33,470
We're not going to send,
we send our guys love to war without 

2439
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:34,300
giving a shit,
and I'm telling you that's not true.

2440
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,030
I agree with you.
When did you go to war?

2441
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:39,220
I've never been in the industry.
You don't know,

2442
01:47:39,221 --> 01:47:42,130
but I say pull them out of everything 
because I've never been in the military.

2443
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:47,020
When we are attacked by a nation,
we should not be proven first.

2444
01:47:47,021 --> 01:47:48,790
I feel we proved that.
You feel we did.

2445
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:51,550
You also feel that fucking Bush was 
behind nine slash 11,

2446
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:55,150
so we're always going to district very 
go put fucking words in my mouth.

2447
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:57,220
You feel that the US government was 
behind it.

2448
01:47:59,290 --> 01:48:01,760
Who Do you think you are covering it 
all?

2449
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,860
You have not been told the truth.
So you feel like,

2450
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,690
well,
okay,

2451
01:48:04,691 --> 01:48:05,890
wait a minute.
All right,

2452
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:08,530
if you'll calm down the moment you're 
yelling,

2453
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,720
you're the governor talking your 
language,

2454
01:48:13,721 --> 01:48:16,000
so you're wondering how you shouldn't 
bring it down to my level.

2455
01:48:16,001 --> 01:48:21,001
Bring me up to yours.
I saw that you said about not going to 

2456
01:48:23,651 --> 01:48:26,310
let me talk.
I'm out the door talking the whole time.

2457
01:48:26,311 --> 01:48:29,140
All you do is yell over people and you 
don't want to address point by point.

2458
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:32,070
You Act like we say,
send our boys to fuck them.

2459
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:34,570
We've never said that.
I agree with you.

2460
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:37,900
I want to pull them out of Germany.
I want to pull them everywhere.

2461
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:40,360
The US military should never be dying 
for other countries.

2462
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:44,250
I don't care.
I don't care if Kim's job,

2463
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:46,150
you'll take this out.
That's not my business.

2464
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:51,540
I just think that if we're attacked,
we have the right to want our military 

2465
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:52,120
to respond,
so that's not some warmonger saying,

2466
01:48:52,121 --> 01:48:53,350
fuck the voice.
Send them over.

2467
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:01,320
That's what I walked in and he sits and 
looks at Jimmy.

2468
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,050
Why Awkward?
That was a fair point.

2469
01:49:05,051 --> 01:49:06,700
I just made you a raw when you said 
that.

2470
01:49:06,730 --> 01:49:11,730
I don't know.
I didn't listen to over,

2471
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:19,720
you know,
yelling at me because I'm not talking.

2472
01:49:19,721 --> 01:49:21,610
I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just telling you back to your point.

2473
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:25,450
You accused us of something.
So let's say that you guys are just full

2474
01:49:25,451 --> 01:49:27,310
of Shit.
Interesting

2475
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:27,840
guy,
Jimmy,

2476
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:29,430
because you're a liberal and a lot of 
ways,

2477
01:49:29,431 --> 01:49:31,500
but you're also conservative in a lot of
ways.

2478
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:32,340
What is that?
Oh,

2479
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:33,090
thank you John.
Okay.

2480
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:34,980
You're,
you're,

2481
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:39,990
uh,
you're very conservative and right wing 

2482
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:39,990
and a lot of ways.
Certainly you're also very liberal.

2483
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:45,020
Like,
do you still like to hear what you're 

2484
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:47,451
saying in this and you still stand by 
what you're saying about pulling our 

2485
01:49:47,451 --> 01:49:47,451
government,
our military out of everywhere.

2486
01:49:47,451 --> 01:49:48,250
Absolutely.

2487
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,770
You think fuck the rest of the world.
Fuck Egypt.

2488
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:53,170
I'm sick of given them money.
When people hear,

2489
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:53,950
don't eat.
Yeah.

2490
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:59,090
I'm tired of US fucking telling 
everybody else how to live their lives 

2491
01:49:59,090 --> 01:49:59,200
and we don't do it.
We tell,

2492
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:01,570
we tell,
we tell people don't do this,

2493
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:03,310
don't do that.
And meanwhile,

2494
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:05,590
if two guys want to get married,
they can't.

2495
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,350
If we were not full of shit and we were 
consistent,

2496
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:10,720
I'd be fine with it.
Just don't.

2497
01:50:10,721 --> 01:50:13,420
I just think that the rest of the world,
fuck them.

2498
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:16,900
But do you really believe that we were 
attacked by country?

2499
01:50:17,390 --> 01:50:22,390
Um,
I believe about sending troops into 

2500
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:22,390
other.
I'm in Afghanistan,

2501
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:23,790
not Iraq.
What did you think?

2502
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,430
We were attacked by Afghanistan,
no,

2503
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:27,370
but what I meant by that,
and this was more to this,

2504
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:32,371
was the fact that the Taliban held bin 
Ladin and shielded Bin Ladin and refused

2505
01:50:33,901 --> 01:50:38,901
to give him to us was what I felt 
happened and I felt that they were,

2506
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:43,660
they were complicit in allowing him to 
operate there.

2507
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,150
So while the whole country didn't attack
us,

2508
01:50:46,151 --> 01:50:48,100
I feel have they just given us bin 
Ladin,

2509
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:51,360
we never would've attacked Afghanistan.
You're a smart

2510
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:54,670
guy and you know that the line that you 
get from the media,

2511
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,790
the press releases or what have you are,
you know,

2512
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:02,791
it's garbage.
So why would you think that they really 

2513
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:05,311
were shielding Osama bin Ladin in 
Afghanistan when you know what you know 

2514
01:51:05,311 --> 01:51:09,661
about Jessica Lynch,
where they lied about Jessica Lynch 

2515
01:51:09,661 --> 01:51:12,331
being rescue.
She was kidnapped and meanwhile she's 

2516
01:51:12,331 --> 01:51:12,580
just in a hospital in,
in Iraq,

2517
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:17,610
and they didn't even fire a bullet when 
they got her out of there and she 

2518
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:20,731
actually was pretty vocal about it.
And in that received death threats and 

2519
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:24,061
was threatened by numerous people that 
she was called a trader because she 

2520
01:51:24,061 --> 01:51:24,880
didn't go along with the company line.
And then of course,

2521
01:51:24,881 --> 01:51:29,881
you know the Pat Tillman story,
you know the difference between his 

2522
01:51:29,881 --> 01:51:32,101
brothers version of the events and his 
brothers version of how his son or his 

2523
01:51:32,101 --> 01:51:35,971
brother,
Pat Tillman felt about being in the war 

2524
01:51:35,971 --> 01:51:36,580
once he was there.
So different from what,

2525
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:39,130
what the government was saying,
their press releases.

2526
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:42,040
And then when we found out that it was 
actually friendly fire that killed him,

2527
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,720
he was actually killed by American 
troops.

2528
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:47,500
The whole thing becomes incredibly 
complex and really fucked up.

2529
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:52,501
And you're realizing that someone's 
lying to you and they're painting a bad 

2530
01:51:52,501 --> 01:51:55,231
picture.
So why would you assume that they're 

2531
01:51:55,231 --> 01:51:57,511
telling you the truth about Osama bin 
Ladin being hit by the Taliban in 

2532
01:51:57,511 --> 01:51:57,511
Afghanistan?

2533
01:51:57,511 --> 01:51:58,720
In that case?
I believed it.

2534
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:01,500
They have at the time you did.
And I still probably.

2535
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:05,020
I still think the Taliban knew he was 
there and was happy he was there.

2536
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,520
No,
I don't blame them.

2537
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,690
That's their religious fanatics.
He's a religious guy.

2538
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:10,180
I get it.
I get it.

2539
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:10,240
Have

2540
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,660
you ever talked to them?
Sorry to interrupt you,

2541
01:52:11,661 --> 01:52:13,340
but have you ever talked to special 
forces guys?

2542
01:52:13,341 --> 01:52:14,900
I know you talked to a lot of those 
guys,

2543
01:52:14,901 --> 01:52:17,390
like you have them on your podcast like 
you had that we had.

2544
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:19,550
We had Chris Kyle,
the guy who was killed.

2545
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:24,580
Yeah.
Will you tie ever talked to them about 

2546
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:24,580
Osama bin Laden?
Um,

2547
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:24,580
yeah,
we have a lot of them.

2548
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:26,210
Don't think that that guy wasn't even 
alive.

2549
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,280
They think he had been dead a long time 
ago,

2550
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,320
that they just decided to use it as a 
good time to say they got them.

2551
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:35,510
And that Benazir Bhutto that will,
that was killed in a,

2552
01:52:35,511 --> 01:52:37,160
um,
an explosion.

2553
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,390
Remember that?
No.

2554
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:40,100
Is that her name?
Was she the one who was shot,

2555
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,170
killed?
Who was the woman that was killed?

2556
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,210
She was president or she was running for
president.

2557
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,130
I

2558
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:51,130
wish I knew.
I'm such a fucking idiot when it comes 

2559
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:51,130
to foreign policy.
Killed.

2560
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:51,170
Anyway,
she said,

2561
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,450
whoever this woman was,
she said that,

2562
01:52:53,451 --> 01:52:54,560
uh,
yeah,

2563
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:55,790
that's it.
Benazir Bhutto.

2564
01:52:56,090 --> 01:53:00,560
She was killed in 2007.
She said that she went to his funeral,

2565
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:04,670
I mean,
she was a prime minister of Pakistan,

2566
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:07,100
two consecutive term nonconsecutive 
terms.

2567
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,380
Which shot though,
is that?

2568
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:11,630
Or was it?
That was the bar and she.

2569
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:12,890
She said,
I mean,

2570
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:14,720
this is not a woman that has any reason 
to lie.

2571
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,160
She said she went to his fucking 
funeral.

2572
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:18,470
The,
maybe it was one of those fake funerals,

2573
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:21,320
like,
hey,

2574
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:23,420
maybe,
or just as fucking put out.

2575
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:28,010
Maybe they knew that bitch would tell.
So let's bring it to a fake funeral.

2576
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:33,100
She'll talk some shit.
We made a fake Osama bin Ladin and then 

2577
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:33,320
he can hide in Pakistan.
That's possible too.

2578
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,700
It didn't really help Obama.

2579
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:36,290
I mean,
like I firmly believe.

2580
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:38,420
I do think that he was there.
Um,

2581
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,610
and I do think that they just caught 
them the way they said.

2582
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:42,590
I don't believe everything the 
government tells me at all,

2583
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:45,680
but in this particular case it makes 
sense to me and I,

2584
01:53:45,681 --> 01:53:48,410
it's not that difficult to stretch them 
to make that.

2585
01:53:48,411 --> 01:53:50,490
He was holed up there and they finally 
got it.

2586
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:52,200
But it took 10 fucking years.
Like,

2587
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,080
I don't see the government being patient
enough or anybody not wanting to grab,

2588
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:59,630
like Bush was getting slaughtered in 
the,

2589
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:04,720
in the polls.
There's no way anybody would like a rip 

2590
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:08,890
on the Republican side would have 
allowed that to continue or you know 

2591
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:13,141
what I mean,
whether they could have grabbed the 

2592
01:54:13,141 --> 01:54:13,790
glory for it as opposed to a under 
Obama's watch.

2593
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:17,270
So do I believe that the Taliban was.
If it was the French government,

2594
01:54:17,271 --> 01:54:18,860
I would not have believed they were 
hiding him.

2595
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:24,160
Even Saddam Hussein,
I probably wouldn't have believed and I 

2596
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:26,480
was at originally for the Iraq war and 
then I'm against it.

2597
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:28,370
I shouldn't have been for.
Um,

2598
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,750
but with Afghanistan I feel they were 
much more religious fanatics and you see

2599
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:37,751
the way the Taliban are and I do think 
that they were protecting him and they 

2600
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:41,831
were okay with him being there.
So that was why I was okay with us 

2601
01:54:41,831 --> 01:54:43,050
lashing out at them.
Um,

2602
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:48,550
Iraq was a mistake and I wish we hadn't 
gone there because I think that most of 

2603
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:52,541
the rack people don't give a fuck about 
us and I don't think our American lives 

2604
01:54:52,541 --> 01:54:53,850
should be shed over that shit.
Like I believe in pulling,

2605
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:56,600
get them out of Germany to Wiley and 
fucking Germany.

2606
01:54:56,601 --> 01:54:57,500
It's a waste of money.
Yeah.

2607
01:54:57,501 --> 01:55:02,501
But do you think that uh,
we're really in Iraq for the Iraqi 

2608
01:55:02,501 --> 01:55:02,501
people?
No,

2609
01:55:02,501 --> 01:55:02,501
no,
of course not.

2610
01:55:02,501 --> 01:55:07,470
We're in Iraq to make some money.
They're there to control oil then we 

2611
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:08,090
should say most likely.
Right.

2612
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:11,390
You can't say that because nobody's 
going to agree to go to war then.

2613
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:16,570
I mean,
that's been the strategy from the 

2614
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:19,030
beginning of time.
That's what Eisenhower warned people 

2615
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:19,820
about when he was leaving office.
That's what people have always said.

2616
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,110
I mean,
did you ever read that?

2617
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:22,190
Um,
uh,

2618
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,630
Smedley Butler thing he wrote,
he was a general in 1935.

2619
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,070
He wrote both.
No,

2620
01:55:28,071 --> 01:55:31,010
I haven't.
So what's kind of a famous piece?

2621
01:55:31,011 --> 01:55:34,880
It's called war is a racket and he wrote
this whole thing about his entire career

2622
01:55:34,881 --> 01:55:38,930
in the military being a racket.
And it was all about really about money,

2623
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:43,931
about bankers and about oil companies 
and about all these different things 

2624
01:55:43,931 --> 01:55:44,670
where he was really,
he thought he was doing one thing,

2625
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,820
but he's really just protecting the 
interests of these gigantic 

2626
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:49,820
institutions.

2627
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:53,600
And when you read it,
it's really hard to read because it's 

2628
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:56,211
hard to wrap your head around the fact 
that this was 1930 something and it's 

2629
01:55:56,211 --> 01:55:56,550
the same now.
It's the same way now,

2630
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:59,970
almost 100 years later,
18 years later.

2631
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,460
And it's basically the same,
you know,

2632
01:56:02,461 --> 01:56:05,730
I agree with a lot more of that than I 
would have five or six years ago.

2633
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:08,720
What's changed?
Just just,

2634
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,020
just,
uh,

2635
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:15,530
you know,
guys like Bernie madoff and all of 

2636
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:17,741
these.
It just growing up a little bit more or 

2637
01:56:17,741 --> 01:56:17,741
looking at things differently or reading
more about,

2638
01:56:17,741 --> 01:56:17,741
you know,
just whatever,

2639
01:56:17,741 --> 01:56:22,281
whatever changes in opinion.
And over time I've never afraid of 

2640
01:56:22,281 --> 01:56:22,590
looking back and going,
oh,

2641
01:56:22,591 --> 01:56:23,850
I should have thought another way on 
that.

2642
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:25,830
I don't have.
That's why I don't.

2643
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,920
Again,
I don't try to convince the audience 

2644
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:30,920
that I'm right.
I'm just honest about my opinion.

2645
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:31,060
500.
Well,

2646
01:56:31,070 --> 01:56:33,450
you're brave with your opinions too,
which is important.

2647
01:56:33,451 --> 01:56:34,030
You know,
you,

2648
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:39,280
if you really believe it,
you have a reason for believing it and 

2649
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:39,280
you're willing to talk about it,
you know,

2650
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,570
I think that's a,
that's a,

2651
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:42,810
that's a rare thing.
People don't want to do that.

2652
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:45,090
They don't want to take chances with 
controversial subjects.

2653
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:49,200
It's a very controversial subject to 
defend war or even criticize war.

2654
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:50,310
It's controversial.
It's like,

2655
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:51,920
you know,
becomes a,

2656
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:56,010
it becomes a topic of heated discussion 
always.

2657
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:00,270
I feel like with the Afghan government,
again,

2658
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:00,680
if,
if,

2659
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:02,530
if I found out that they weren't 
shielded,

2660
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:03,330
been loud,
and I say,

2661
01:57:03,331 --> 01:57:04,350
Oh God,
I was wrong about that.

2662
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,920
To really find out about the Afghan 
government is that we pay the brother of

2663
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:10,500
cars by the CIA.
He's a drug dealer.

2664
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:15,680
The CIA has been paying him for almost a
fucking decade or something crazy like 

2665
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:15,680
that.

2666
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:18,300
Have you interviewed sod any know who's 
a buddy of Jonathan's?

2667
01:57:18,301 --> 01:57:20,340
Although he knows everything about.
He's from Afghanistan.

2668
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,860
Oh yeah.
What does he do?

2669
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:23,090
He runs moby.
He's,

2670
01:57:23,091 --> 01:57:28,091
uh,
he's like the Rupert Murdoch of 

2671
01:57:28,091 --> 01:57:28,091
Afghanistan.
What's moby?

2672
01:57:28,091 --> 01:57:28,091
Uh,
it's,

2673
01:57:28,091 --> 01:57:28,740
it's a media company,
he's a TV station there,

2674
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:33,860
a sadness in Afghanistan.
He knows everything about it and he 

2675
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:38,751
would,
he could tell you about the Taliban 

2676
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:40,131
because he's communicated with them,
he knows and he's a guy you would love,

2677
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:43,620
love to have on the show.
He's a great guest.

2678
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,270
That sounds awesome.
Really Bright Guy.

2679
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:50,710
He would be able to answer that question
a very well and he would be very 

2680
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:52,890
accurate and whatever he said because he
knows those guys.

2681
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:56,600
You know what my favorite story about 
Afghanistan is how they talk the Taliban

2682
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:58,840
to giving up the position or they how 
they talk,

2683
01:57:58,841 --> 01:58:03,841
the war lords,
the local guys into giving up the 

2684
01:58:03,841 --> 01:58:03,841
position for the Taliban.

2685
01:58:03,841 --> 01:58:04,770
I Agora,
yes.

2686
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,840
Given Viagara Viagra like guns,
I don't need guns.

2687
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:14,760
Plus I have 20 was then I cannot even 
get it up and then they're like,

2688
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:15,720
oh,
okay,

2689
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:20,750
we got you.
All the sudden he's old dudes are just 

2690
01:58:21,331 --> 01:58:23,480
naked.
The perpetual hard ons.

2691
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:27,590
This running these heroines that they 
have up there and what would it be?

2692
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:30,890
Barbaric way of living life.
They have mean they,

2693
01:58:30,891 --> 01:58:33,930
they have these,
these with a lot of people don't realize

2694
01:58:33,931 --> 01:58:38,931
about Afghanistan is if you watch 
documentaries on it or talk to people 

2695
01:58:38,931 --> 01:58:41,350
that have been there.
It really is like it's frozen in time.

2696
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:45,310
Like there's people that are warlords 
and they control segments of the,

2697
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:50,340
of the land and then there are bordered 
by other warlords and these guys have 

2698
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:53,460
like 20 wives and it's.
It's a weird wacky sort of a way of 

2699
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:53,770
life.
Fifteenth Century.

2700
01:58:53,771 --> 01:58:55,080
It feels century.

2701
01:58:55,180 --> 01:59:00,180
I don't relate to it at all and again,
I don't think we should be over there 

2702
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:00,180
interacting.
I just,

2703
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:02,110
not that we should never have 
interaction with the countries,

2704
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:07,470
but the fact that we try to throw our 
ideas into other people's business like 

2705
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:13,240
I don't care what North Korea does.
It's nothing to do with me.

2706
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:18,740
I'm all that money.
We waste on fucking other countries 

2707
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,430
should be spent on American citizens and
if we want obamacare,

2708
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:23,380
finally,
let's take care of everybody.

2709
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:28,381
Take that billion you're given to Egypt 
and then fucking give it back to the 

2710
01:59:28,381 --> 01:59:31,831
American people.
Like give people here who have their 

2711
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:32,230
fucking pensions taken away,
uh,

2712
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:37,231
you know,
give them that billion dollars like 

2713
01:59:37,231 --> 01:59:39,570
there's,
so we waste so much money and I think 

2714
01:59:39,570 --> 01:59:39,570
that the,
like you said,

2715
01:59:39,570 --> 01:59:40,750
that the,
the asterisk with that should be,

2716
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:45,990
if anybody attacks us physically,
our response should be embarrassingly 

2717
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:46,900
bad.

2718
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:49,910
Linkedin,
she'd be embarrassingly strong and,

2719
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:50,360
and,
and,

2720
01:59:50,361 --> 01:59:53,140
and devastating.
So I think that should be the only.

2721
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,420
That should be the thing that you do 
what you want,

2722
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:58,080
but if you come into our yard,
um,

2723
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:58,930
we will,
uh,

2724
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,960
we will blast you out of existence.
Childish,

2725
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,470
by the way,
I'm sure.

2726
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:04,790
Well,
I'm childish in a lot of ways to it,

2727
02:00:04,791 --> 02:00:08,650
but as a standup comedian,
I think it's ridiculous for me to try to

2728
02:00:08,651 --> 02:00:10,810
even attempt to understand what it must 
be locked,

2729
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:13,710
running foreign policy just to say that.
Sure,

2730
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,170
sure,
sure.

2731
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:19,320
But if you,
if you look at the entirety of the 

2732
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,500
situation,
you would see that they would,

2733
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,770
I would think that there's probably a 
benefit and giving a lot of people money

2734
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:26,350
because they make you and you're 
indebted to you.

2735
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:29,650
Those people are indebted to you.
And then you can kind of do things.

2736
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,870
Sure,
you can put bases over there,

2737
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:33,940
you can extract resources,
you could do all this shit.

2738
02:00:33,941 --> 02:00:35,060
The United States does.
Sure.

2739
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:39,400
And we can't do all that if we don't 
give the money and if we don't give them

2740
02:00:39,401 --> 02:00:44,401
money.
And then they all start fucking forming 

2741
02:00:44,401 --> 02:00:45,730
their own organizations,
then it's not one world power anymore.

2742
02:00:45,731 --> 02:00:50,731
Like it is now.
Like the reason why one world power 

2743
02:00:50,731 --> 02:00:52,981
works is because we put the whole world 
into sort of a perpetual welfare state 

2744
02:00:52,981 --> 02:00:56,940
where the whole world relies on the 
United States either for military 

2745
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,150
support or from financial support or 
something.

2746
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,650
And by doing that you kind of,
it,

2747
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:03,160
it's,
it's a terrible way of looking at it.

2748
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:06,340
But the reality is when you have these 
countries that are indebted to you,

2749
02:01:06,341 --> 02:01:07,700
those countries kind of,
Oh you,

2750
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:11,350
you can get them to do shit and stay 
calm and they don't try to take over the

2751
02:01:11,351 --> 02:01:11,770
world.

2752
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:13,000
You know,
they oh fuck,

2753
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:18,001
load of money.
You have military bases there and you 

2754
02:01:18,001 --> 02:01:18,001
keep things on that level.
And when,

2755
02:01:18,001 --> 02:01:21,460
when you tell people how many bases the 
United States has in other countries,

2756
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:26,520
most people have no idea.
There's more than a hundred different 

2757
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,570
countries in the world that have United 
States military presence.

2758
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:30,490
Like when you hear about that,
you'll go,

2759
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:33,000
wait a minute,
what we,

2760
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:34,510
this is what I love about us.
And again,

2761
02:01:34,511 --> 02:01:35,650
I love America.
I really do.

2762
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:40,651
And I do think we're a great country.
I mean they talk about American 

2763
02:01:40,651 --> 02:01:40,651
exceptionalism and believe a lot of it.
And some

2764
02:01:40,651 --> 02:01:41,930
of it I think is a bit overblown.
But,

2765
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:46,931
uh,
I have patriotism and pride and you 

2766
02:01:46,931 --> 02:01:46,931
know,
this is not about me.

2767
02:01:46,931 --> 02:01:51,100
Oh Fuck America at all.
I just hate the hip because the same 

2768
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:52,520
mentality that got do as I say,
not as I do,

2769
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:57,540
Shit trickles down into our daily lives 
and eventually effects us as comics and 

2770
02:01:57,540 --> 02:02:01,961
performers because the people feel 
comfortable being self righteous are 

2771
02:02:01,961 --> 02:02:02,390
duplicitous and it makes me fucking 
crazy.

2772
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:04,580
But like we're bellyaching about 
snowden.

2773
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:09,760
The,
what the fuck do we think the Soviets 

2774
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,011
are going to do?
We have had our door open to Soviet 

2775
02:02:12,011 --> 02:02:14,930
defectors forever and we cry that 
they're keeping him.

2776
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:19,010
Of course they should keep him.
I don't blame the Soviets for not giving

2777
02:02:19,011 --> 02:02:24,011
him back.
We're going to huff and puff when all 

2778
02:02:24,011 --> 02:02:24,011
we've done is say,
hey,

2779
02:02:24,011 --> 02:02:28,000
if you're a defect or come on over,
we'll take care of you and we should do 

2780
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,000
that.
Not only that,

2781
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,220
do you know what the reason,
like the critical boiling

2782
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,960
point was when they decided to accept 
his,

2783
02:02:31,961 --> 02:02:34,510
uh,
his acceptance for his,

2784
02:02:34,511 --> 02:02:35,440
uh,
um,

2785
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:37,690
application for asylum.
Thank you.

2786
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:42,820
Can Stumble through that quick enough.
The United States was criticizing Russia

2787
02:02:42,821 --> 02:02:46,750
for trying to silence political dissent.
There.

2788
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:50,380
There were literally had the balls to 
criticize Russia for silencing political

2789
02:02:50,381 --> 02:02:55,381
dissent.
While the biggest whistleblower in the 

2790
02:02:55,381 --> 02:02:58,480
history of our country is sitting in 
their airport and they were like,

2791
02:02:58,510 --> 02:02:59,920
really?
Like,

2792
02:02:59,921 --> 02:03:04,000
are you guys that fucking deft?
Are you that fucking dumb?

2793
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:05,290
It's not death.
It's Daft,

2794
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:06,640
right?
We are that whatever the word is,

2795
02:03:06,641 --> 02:03:06,920
right?
Yeah.

2796
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:12,140
You guys that arrogant that you think 
that you can criticize us while we're 

2797
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:15,451
holding the guy that fucking released 
all those documents that prove that you 

2798
02:03:15,451 --> 02:03:16,270
guys are lying twats yeah.
And then the government,

2799
02:03:16,271 --> 02:03:21,271
I mean he went on Obama,
went on the tonight show with Jay Leno 

2800
02:03:21,271 --> 02:03:22,150
and was lying about it.

2801
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:24,640
Wasn't,
wasn't telling the truth about releasing

2802
02:03:24,641 --> 02:03:25,990
the.
First of all,

2803
02:03:25,991 --> 02:03:28,450
he was saying that people are not being 
spied on,

2804
02:03:28,451 --> 02:03:33,451
but that's not true.
People are being spied on and they're 

2805
02:03:33,451 --> 02:03:36,151
telling the dea to there showing them 
how to fake a investigation so that they

2806
02:03:37,631 --> 02:03:42,631
don't show that they got the records 
from the NSA there showing them how to 

2807
02:03:42,631 --> 02:03:44,930
retroactively piece together an 
investigation investigation.

2808
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:45,580
So they say,
well,

2809
02:03:45,581 --> 02:03:47,620
we are,
we arrived at our results this way.

2810
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:51,070
If you already know someones guilty 
because you have the NSA,

2811
02:03:51,071 --> 02:03:52,210
uh,
paperwork on them,

2812
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,280
email,
phone calls,

2813
02:03:54,281 --> 02:03:59,281
what have you,
all you have to do is zoom in on this 

2814
02:03:59,281 --> 02:04:01,580
guy and then you could find the evidence
and find a reason to,

2815
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:03,670
to investigate him.
Cause you know,

2816
02:04:03,671 --> 02:04:05,710
he's guilty already.
You can just piece it together easily

2817
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:10,750
and again on where are they doing that 
to American citizens for normal 

2818
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:15,201
interactions or was it really for people
who were using the a loophole of being 

2819
02:04:17,761 --> 02:04:20,450
here and communicating so we couldn't 
get into like we're the.

2820
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:22,270
It's almost like somebody once said 
after 9:11

2821
02:04:22,271 --> 02:04:24,420
this the constitution is on a suicide 
pact.

2822
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:27,300
Like were they attempting to.
And I,

2823
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:32,360
I don't know the answer to it.
Were they attempting to use like a 

2824
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:32,880
America's law is kind of against it.
Like,

2825
02:04:32,881 --> 02:04:34,540
well,
I was American consistency

2826
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:39,580
using the dea.
The Dea was investigating citizens for 

2827
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:39,580
selling drugs.
Always draw the.

2828
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:40,230
Okay,
I'll do as you were saying that.

2829
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:41,190
Yeah.
As far as I know,

2830
02:04:41,191 --> 02:04:43,460
it's American citizens and believe so I 
have to go to the store.

2831
02:04:43,510 --> 02:04:45,090
I don't want that.
I don't want this to that.

2832
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:46,560
Right.
I don't want to use not just that.

2833
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:51,650
The real problem with is not just the 
fact they're catching people doing 

2834
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:51,650
things like,
I'm all for you.

2835
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:52,530
Removing meth labs.
Don't get me wrong.

2836
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:56,820
The problem is you're also asking 
investigators to fake an investigation,

2837
02:04:57,030 --> 02:05:00,420
and when you do that,
you're asking public servants to lie and

2838
02:05:00,421 --> 02:05:03,900
you're asking people that are in a very 
noble position,

2839
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:08,901
the position of law enforcement,
you're actually asking them to behave 

2840
02:05:08,901 --> 02:05:08,970
unethically.
You know what the fucking laws are,

2841
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:14,210
and you know if you catch someone doing 
something and you don't want to reveal 

2842
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:16,200
the message in what you caught them,
so you think it's okay to lie.

2843
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:19,950
Well that's a slippery goddamn slowly 
that gets real slippery.

2844
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:23,290
You're thinking an investigation.
What else are you fake and what I mean?

2845
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:26,280
That opens the door to you faking 
evidence that opens the door to you.

2846
02:05:26,281 --> 02:05:29,140
Faking a lot of shit if you think that a
person is is,

2847
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:32,250
is guilty if you can't prove it,
and that's always been what said.

2848
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:37,251
That's how Oj got off.
That's a whole mark furhman thing that 

2849
02:05:37,251 --> 02:05:37,251
he might have.
People said,

2850
02:05:37,251 --> 02:05:38,310
hey man,
you might be fucking planting evidence.

2851
02:05:38,311 --> 02:05:39,180
Sure,
there's a lot of.

2852
02:05:39,181 --> 02:05:41,010
That shit is real.
We see it all the time.

2853
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:46,011
There's a million videos on youtube of 
cops that got busted planting things or 

2854
02:05:46,011 --> 02:05:47,040
stories online.
People get busted.

2855
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:52,160
So that sort of mentality is extremely 
dangerous and that's why I'm against it 

2856
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,210
and that makes sense.
And uh,

2857
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:58,220
and you know,
I'm against it for is basically a 

2858
02:05:58,220 --> 02:05:58,220
perverse reason.

2859
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:01,860
It is just simply a dislike of this nosy
con culture we have become and it makes 

2860
02:06:02,581 --> 02:06:04,240
me crazy.
So I,

2861
02:06:04,241 --> 02:06:08,640
I like to see people getting it.
Like I like to see people going,

2862
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:10,740
oh,
when it's me,

2863
02:06:10,741 --> 02:06:11,960
it's different.
And I,

2864
02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:13,530
and again,
someone could sit down and go,

2865
02:06:13,531 --> 02:06:14,030
well,
don't do it.

2866
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:19,040
Of course I understand the difference 
between the government doing it and us 

2867
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:20,380
looking at tiger,
of course I get that.

2868
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:20,820
Well,
you know,

2869
02:06:20,821 --> 02:06:25,821
sociologists have an interesting take on
what's going on and it's as far as our 

2870
02:06:25,821 --> 02:06:28,950
attraction to gossip,
gossip magazines and tmz type things and

2871
02:06:28,951 --> 02:06:31,980
celebrity gossip.
And what they're saying is that we're in

2872
02:06:31,981 --> 02:06:36,090
a weird point in time where we have the 
largest populations,

2873
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:39,300
big giant populations,
but we don't know each other anymore.

2874
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:42,240
You mean you live in New York City,
you live in an apartment building,

2875
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:47,241
right?
How many people live in your apartment 

2876
02:06:47,241 --> 02:06:47,241
building?

2877
02:06:47,241 --> 02:06:47,241
40 five stories.
A lot.

2878
02:06:47,241 --> 02:06:49,990
40 five stories of people.
How many is that?

2879
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:52,470
7,000.
500.

2880
02:06:52,471 --> 02:06:57,471
A thousand maybe.
I just don't know how some people will 

2881
02:06:57,471 --> 02:06:57,471
think about that.
Think about what a big neighborhood that

2882
02:06:57,471 --> 02:06:58,590
is.
That's a massive neighborhood.

2883
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:00,540
How many people in that fucking building
do you know?

2884
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,850
Literally my neighbor and a couple of 
maybe two.

2885
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:04,470
Yeah,
it's craziness.

2886
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:09,680
So they're saying that we're missing a 
need for a community and we're missing.

2887
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:15,290
There's like a draw of like busy body 
about each other like finding what the 

2888
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:19,731
cultural parameters and boundaries are 
and establishing them by talking about 

2889
02:07:19,731 --> 02:07:23,751
shit.
And normally there would be like a 

2890
02:07:23,751 --> 02:07:23,940
village and everybody in the village,
it'd be like 50 a hundred people.

2891
02:07:23,941 --> 02:07:28,941
Whatever the fuck it is.
And we would all kind of know each 

2892
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:28,941
other's business and figure out what's 
cool and what's not cool.

2893
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:33,420
Sure.
But when you're in this weird situation 

2894
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:33,600
where you don't even know the people 
around you and then you're watching,

2895
02:07:33,601 --> 02:07:36,460
keeping up with the Kardashians,
that fills the void

2896
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:41,460
where community should be.
That's why people are so God damn 

2897
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:44,731
attracted to quote unquote reality shows
as opposed to scripted shows because 

2898
02:07:44,731 --> 02:07:46,180
they know when someone's being a 
Dickhead,

2899
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,640
there's no script to just be in a decade
and you're like,

2900
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:51,150
oh that bitch,
I can't believe she said that to him and

2901
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:56,420
they're really drawn into it because 
they're lacking like a real community 

2902
02:07:56,420 --> 02:08:00,331
and a real established like group of 
people that you interact with on a 

2903
02:08:00,331 --> 02:08:04,261
regular basis all the time and you in 
your village and Plus Network tv did it 

2904
02:08:04,261 --> 02:08:08,601
to themselves by emasculating comedies 
and language and making everything so 

2905
02:08:08,601 --> 02:08:12,811
soft and wrapped up and palatable that 
it be that reality now stands out so 

2906
02:08:12,811 --> 02:08:17,551
much more.
Part of that is a lot of extra what 

2907
02:08:17,551 --> 02:08:20,341
you're saying and some of it is because 
of the writing on regular television is 

2908
02:08:20,341 --> 02:08:20,500
so soft and that's again,
that's not.

2909
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:24,160
The writers are probably very good,
but it's just such fucking predictable.

2910
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,980
Dereck,
all of it is such shit.

2911
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:28,870
There's a lot of shit.
A lot of comms,

2912
02:08:28,871 --> 02:08:31,960
especially that's the worst.
There's no honest language.

2913
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:33,810
There's no honest interactions.
Uh,

2914
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:36,790
everything is presented in a way that 
you know,

2915
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:41,791
is going to be presented.
Have you seen the ads for the new 

2916
02:08:41,791 --> 02:08:42,190
jackass movie?
Bad grandpa?

2917
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,540
No.
Have you seen him?

2918
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:45,460
Holy Shit.
Is it funny?

2919
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:50,520
Oh really?
I went to see elise him last night and 

2920
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:51,520
they had this uh,
and for this jackass film and it's a,

2921
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:55,210
it's a film they did were they made up 
these scenarios and did all these little

2922
02:08:55,211 --> 02:09:00,211
stunts,
but they did them in front of real 

2923
02:09:00,211 --> 02:09:02,431
people.
The people had no idea why it was going 

2924
02:09:02,431 --> 02:09:03,010
on.
I mean it is fucking funny,

2925
02:09:03,011 --> 02:09:08,011
like laugh out loud.
Funny because you don't realize it as 

2926
02:09:08,011 --> 02:09:08,011
you're watching it.
I was like,

2927
02:09:08,011 --> 02:09:12,511
is this an act like what is this?
You're getting tired.

2928
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:24,070
They won't know how it looks most of the
time.

2929
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,920
Anyway.
What

2930
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:30,560
these are real people

2931
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:31,640
gap

2932
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,560
did is they had some scripted shit,
right?

2933
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:38,680
And then the interacting with real 
people.

2934
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:41,510
That's funny about,
nope,

2935
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:43,840
that's a great idea.
But Watch,

2936
02:09:43,841 --> 02:09:45,370
watch some of the shit that goes on.

2937
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:49,330
God.
No.

2938
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:56,770
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2939
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:11,790
Good.
Take that child.

2940
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:16,180
I'm sorry.
You're very pretty when you're mad.

2941
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:22,600
Thank you for being here today.
I'll just call you when it has some fun.

2942
02:10:33,690 --> 02:10:35,360
No,
pretty little girl.

2943
02:10:35,361 --> 02:10:40,361
Got It.
Is that weird?

2944
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,590
We just never seen it.
So it's different.

2945
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:06,650
I don't want to tell people who are 
listening to this,

2946
02:11:06,651 --> 02:11:11,651
what's happening because I could 
probably get in trouble for describing 

2947
02:11:11,651 --> 02:11:12,260
it.
Look at the graph.

2948
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:15,400
Made it rain.
It's fucking funny.

2949
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:17,510
I don't want to say anything.
Watch it on Youtube.

2950
02:11:17,511 --> 02:11:19,570
Why Watch the that?
That's awesome.

2951
02:11:19,571 --> 02:11:24,571
I didn't know about,
but what they did was instead of making 

2952
02:11:24,571 --> 02:11:24,571
just another.
Am I on?

2953
02:11:24,571 --> 02:11:29,130
Yeah.
What they did was instead of making 

2954
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:30,811
another goofy comedy,
they made a hilarious thing where they 

2955
02:11:30,811 --> 02:11:31,720
did it in front of people and the people
had no idea.

2956
02:11:31,721 --> 02:11:36,721
So it is like a movie.
You do have like a boar at sort of a 

2957
02:11:36,721 --> 02:11:38,400
situation where they use real people as 
they're filling them.

2958
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:43,840
So great.
They're going to have to do shit like 

2959
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:43,840
that.
Yeah.

2960
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:44,230
You did the same tired premises over and
over again,

2961
02:11:44,231 --> 02:11:49,231
like I haven't been to a comedy and 
quite awhile it's been awhile since I 

2962
02:11:49,231 --> 02:11:50,830
saw like an actual,
like sit,

2963
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:52,180
you know,
one of those movies,

2964
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:54,460
you know,
date movies or whatever.

2965
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:55,330
I don't,
I,

2966
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:56,560
I don't,
I don't care.

2967
02:11:56,561 --> 02:11:59,710
I know what's going to happen.
You're both going to get together in the

2968
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:01,030
end and everything's going to be funny 
and Yay,

2969
02:12:01,031 --> 02:12:03,640
ha ha.
I'm tired of it.

2970
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:08,970
And everybody's tired of it.
That's why something like this comes 

2971
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:08,970
along and it's just like,
Holy Shit.

2972
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:09,550
It feels different.
What a great idea.

2973
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:14,610
It hits you,
it catches you off guard the way comedy 

2974
02:12:14,610 --> 02:12:14,610
is supposed to.
Where the film is supposed to.

2975
02:12:14,610 --> 02:12:14,730
It feels like,
oh,

2976
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:15,970
this is fresh.
Did you,

2977
02:12:15,971 --> 02:12:16,970
what did you see?
Boron?

2978
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:18,700
Um,
I never saw it.

2979
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:21,610
I saw parts of it.
I'll tell you how dare you.

2980
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:23,440
Did see a lot of it.
I didn't love it.

2981
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:24,760
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why,

2982
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:30,060
because I love the allergy show so much.
I didn't like the parts of it were 

2983
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:30,380
scripted.
Um,

2984
02:12:30,670 --> 02:12:35,670
I liked the g,
the allergy show where I believe it was 

2985
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:38,191
all real people and I didn't like the 
fact that a lot of it was scripted in 

2986
02:12:38,191 --> 02:12:38,191
Bora.

2987
02:12:38,191 --> 02:12:38,191
I didn't,
I didn't think it stunk,

2988
02:12:38,191 --> 02:12:39,910
it just,
I didn't really do much for me,

2989
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:42,640
but they kind of had to do that.
Yeah,

2990
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:45,430
it was a,
there were some very funny moments where

2991
02:12:45,431 --> 02:12:50,431
it brings the bag of shit down.
Like there's a lot of stuff that really 

2992
02:12:50,431 --> 02:12:50,431
made me laugh.
Yeah.

2993
02:12:50,431 --> 02:12:50,440
Yeah.
No,

2994
02:12:50,441 --> 02:12:51,890
it was amazing man.
Uh,

2995
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:57,030
I,
I love that kind of comedy more than 

2996
02:12:57,030 --> 02:12:57,030
anything.
His show,

2997
02:12:57,030 --> 02:12:57,670
the leg show,
there's a lot of people today don't even

2998
02:12:57,671 --> 02:13:02,671
know that.
I wonder if he's going into hiding so 

2999
02:13:02,671 --> 02:13:02,671
that he can do it again,
you know,

3000
02:13:02,671 --> 02:13:06,460
because it's really almost like that 
show will never be erased from the.

3001
02:13:06,570 --> 02:13:11,570
I mean,
there's no way in this day and age you 

3002
02:13:11,570 --> 02:13:11,570
could sneak that pass.
The publicist,

3003
02:13:11,570 --> 02:13:12,420
he needs another.
He needs another character.

3004
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:17,450
No,
the character that no one has seen 

3005
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:17,450
before,
but it would not just have to be another

3006
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:20,911
character.
You'd almost have to be another person 

3007
02:13:20,911 --> 02:13:20,911
because it's too.
It's too the Internet.

3008
02:13:20,911 --> 02:13:22,900
It's too goddamn.
It's too much information about.

3009
02:13:22,930 --> 02:13:24,850
Will you shoot them,
shoot them all first.

3010
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,470
You shoot them all and then you show 
them.

3011
02:13:26,471 --> 02:13:28,690
You don't shoot them week to week.
You can definitely do that.

3012
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,160
Yeah.
You'd have to do like one season,

3013
02:13:30,161 --> 02:13:30,940
right?
I know a lot.

3014
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:32,130
TV production.
Consider

3015
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:34,200
I can't get shit on the air.
It's amazing.

3016
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:36,510
Fucking pontificating waiver and Lucky 
Louie.

3017
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:42,800
Once again,
somebody else does something and I just 

3018
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:42,800
come along for the ride.
Fucking I'll be riding shotgun.

3019
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,780
My name should be your,
uh,

3020
02:13:43,781 --> 02:13:45,090
your thing that you're doing at 
scripted.

3021
02:13:45,091 --> 02:13:46,410
Is this something that you created 
yourself?

3022
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:48,800
Yes.
And it's a sitcom or Wednesday.

3023
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:54,080
It's like a single camera comedy about 
me being a comic and a sex addict and I 

3024
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:56,930
think it's,
I think it's funny and uh,

3025
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:59,190
you know,
I was like nine episodes written.

3026
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,780
Who are you going to bring it to?
Um,

3027
02:14:00,781 --> 02:14:02,790
I've brought it to a few different 
networks and they liked it,

3028
02:14:02,791 --> 02:14:04,280
but the problem was that Louise,
a comedian,

3029
02:14:04,281 --> 02:14:04,620
they were like,
well,

3030
02:14:04,621 --> 02:14:05,370
we don't want it.
You could lose,

3031
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:10,550
which I get,
so I changed it to being a radio show 

3032
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:11,070
host,
which I actually like a lot better.

3033
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,550
Um,
and I've just been kind of frazzled with

3034
02:14:14,551 --> 02:14:15,950
it.
I just haven't done anything with it.

3035
02:14:15,951 --> 02:14:17,280
I'm so stupid.
What do you mean?

3036
02:14:17,281 --> 02:14:18,660
What's wrong with you?
I just,

3037
02:14:18,670 --> 02:14:19,590
I,
I,

3038
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:22,380
you know,
I don't get this stuff done.

3039
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:25,110
Like I should get it done.
I have a manager,

3040
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:27,980
I have a personal appearance agent,
but I don't have an agent and uh,

3041
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:30,330
we get as much done as we can.
Why don't you have an agent?

3042
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,700
I don't know.
It's a good question.

3043
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:35,190
He's so logical,
but other aspects of your life?

3044
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:36,010
Yeah.
Let's see.

3045
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:36,510
You know,
again,

3046
02:14:36,511 --> 02:14:41,511
can I zone out?
Sometimes I'm just fucking online being 

3047
02:14:41,511 --> 02:14:44,871
a creep.
And how much of your time was spent 

3048
02:14:44,871 --> 02:14:46,380
being a sex addict?
How much of your daily?

3049
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,650
It's hard to say when I'm doing good,
I'm doing good.

3050
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:51,060
When I'm doing bad,
there's been times where literally I get

3051
02:14:51,061 --> 02:14:54,120
home from Radio at 11 and then all of a 
sudden it's like,

3052
02:14:54,121 --> 02:14:55,170
you know,
I've eaten and stuff,

3053
02:14:55,171 --> 02:14:55,580
but it's like,
man,

3054
02:14:55,581 --> 02:14:56,070
it's 8:30.

3055
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:58,860
I gotta go to work.
Like the whole day was wasted.

3056
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:01,470
It's like so many of those days.
It's like being in a fog.

3057
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:06,770
Plus I don't sleep at all really.
I'm always tired because I fucking dumb 

3058
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:07,470
sleep apnea.
So you didn't,

3059
02:15:07,471 --> 02:15:08,880
you haven't done anything with your 
sleep apnea?

3060
02:15:08,881 --> 02:15:11,910
I've done two tests.
I'm literally,

3061
02:15:11,911 --> 02:15:15,750
the only thing worse than a pedophile is
a fucking sleep apnea test technician.

3062
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:17,820
Those fuckers,
uh,

3063
02:15:17,821 --> 02:15:21,870
I knew what I needed and I'll never 
forgive the woman for not testing me for

3064
02:15:21,871 --> 02:15:23,820
it.
I need an asv machine which,

3065
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:27,810
which handles complex apnea and um,
I'm finally going in for a test with the

3066
02:15:27,811 --> 02:15:30,090
new company probably within the next few
weeks,

3067
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,750
but I need a mask that fits me properly.
Like,

3068
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:37,840
you know,
I need a custom made mask and there was 

3069
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:38,430
a place that did him in Dallas,
but I can't find them anymore.

3070
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:40,170
You lost weight?
Yeah.

3071
02:15:40,171 --> 02:15:40,800
Thank you.
I did.

3072
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:43,980
Did that make an impact on your sleep?
It wasn't that,

3073
02:15:43,981 --> 02:15:45,750
it might've made,
it might've made the,

3074
02:15:45,751 --> 02:15:47,370
uh,
the,

3075
02:15:47,371 --> 02:15:49,560
uh,
obstructive apnea a bit different,

3076
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:52,410
which is when your throat closed up 
because of your tongue blocking it.

3077
02:15:52,790 --> 02:15:53,030
But,
uh,

3078
02:15:53,110 --> 02:15:58,110
the central apnea,
I don't think it affected by weight at 

3079
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:00,921
all.
What's the difference when your brain 

3080
02:16:00,921 --> 02:16:00,921
just doesn't say breathe,
like that's what's going on with you and

3081
02:16:00,921 --> 02:16:05,701
I both complex like obstructive is your.
I'll lay there on my back and my tongue 

3082
02:16:05,701 --> 02:16:06,600
goes,
yeah,

3083
02:16:06,650 --> 02:16:11,650
let's make that horrible sound.
But then there's times where I'm laying 

3084
02:16:11,650 --> 02:16:14,331
on my side and I'll just go and I'll 
wake up and I'll realize I haven't 

3085
02:16:16,921 --> 02:16:19,380
breathed.
My Body didn't try to breathe.

3086
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:24,410
So what happens is I wake up with an 
intense itch somewhere like in my neck 

3087
02:16:24,410 --> 02:16:26,320
or my stomach,
or I have to piss or I wake up like,

3088
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:30,790
because your brain sends adrenaline to 
your heart to wake you up because you're

3089
02:16:30,791 --> 02:16:31,360
not breathing.

3090
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:36,660
Wow.
And what is the cause of that 

3091
02:16:36,660 --> 02:16:37,570
oxygenation of the blood?
There's something off with that.

3092
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:39,280
Um,
they don't know completely.

3093
02:16:39,690 --> 02:16:43,750
The central apnea is a newer one that 
they're addressing obstructive,

3094
02:16:43,751 --> 02:16:48,751
they've done a lot with at a central 
apnea they don't know as much about and 

3095
02:16:48,751 --> 02:16:48,751
uh,
the masks are okay,

3096
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:50,950
but it's hard to find a mass that you 
totally comfortable with,

3097
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:51,910
you know,
because,

3098
02:16:51,950 --> 02:16:52,510
uh,
the,

3099
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:53,160
the,
uh,

3100
02:16:53,710 --> 02:16:58,710
for the asv machines are very advanced 
machine and it monitors your breathing 

3101
02:16:58,710 --> 02:17:00,280
and when I'm not attempting to take a 
breath,

3102
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:03,390
it will do it for me and it will force 
the Aaron,

3103
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:06,280
whereas most cpap machines just are 
patterned.

3104
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:09,270
Shh,
shh.

3105
02:17:10,170 --> 02:17:15,170
They're kind of patterning your 
breathing just to keep your throat open 

3106
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:15,170
so your tongue doesn't block it.
But the,

3107
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:16,270
the,
the breathing.

3108
02:17:16,630 --> 02:17:21,630
So this asb machine has to do that and 
it has to calculate when your brain 

3109
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:21,630
isn't trying to breathe.

3110
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:26,280
It's really fucking weird,
frustrating situation because I'm an 

3111
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,940
insomniac anyway,
so I can't fall asleep with the mask.

3112
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:33,150
Do you think any of this has to do with.
Is there any psychological things going 

3113
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:33,420
on?
I'm sure some of it,

3114
02:17:33,421 --> 02:17:37,900
the falling asleep part is like when I'm
acting out sexually,

3115
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:42,960
I don't sleep as well.
Like if I'm sharing to you off the 

3116
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:42,960
videos right before it fucks my mind up 
man,

3117
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:47,310
like when I'm,
when I'm off sex shit for a week or so 

3118
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:47,310
and I'm not jacking off and I'm not 
obsessing.

3119
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:51,660
It's like my brain goes and I can 
breathe and think normally and live 

3120
02:17:51,881 --> 02:17:54,430
normally,
but when I am constantly fucking getting

3121
02:17:54,431 --> 02:17:57,730
that dopamine drip.
Like I literally was recently.

3122
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:00,190
I kept jerking off before sleep,
but I wasn't coming.

3123
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:01,420
I was just getting,
I would add too,

3124
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:03,780
I get myself clothes and then stop and 
then get myself clothes.

3125
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:06,670
And I realized this the other night.
I feel high,

3126
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:12,360
like I'm getting myself fucking high.
Like I'm like a chimp or a fucking a 

3127
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:15,640
journal going for a little fucking.
I'm just,

3128
02:18:15,641 --> 02:18:18,760
I'm going for this high feeling and then
I can sleep.

3129
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:20,500
It's sickening.
How long have you had this issue?

3130
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:22,390
My whole life.
It's been before I drank,

3131
02:18:22,391 --> 02:18:24,430
long before I did drugs.
There was this.

3132
02:18:24,610 --> 02:18:25,300
So,
um,

3133
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:26,800
you know,
the sexual shit,

3134
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:29,770
like the jerking off didn't start till I
was like 10 or 12 or whatever it was.

3135
02:18:30,190 --> 02:18:31,330
But uh,
the edging,

3136
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:34,120
I don't come a lot of times because 
that's the end of the high,

3137
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:38,620
that's the end of the Ra.
So it's like I just keep it going and to

3138
02:18:38,621 --> 02:18:43,621
keep it going because then you don't 
know where it's going to go and I don't 

3139
02:18:43,621 --> 02:18:43,621
come for days or weeks on end because 
I'm like,

3140
02:18:43,621 --> 02:18:43,780
well,
like we're,

3141
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:44,580
we kinda just there.

3142
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:49,800
Um,
because when I come I piss more because 

3143
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:50,510
in my fucking prostates all fucked up 
because it's a disaster.

3144
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:53,740
Your prostate fucks up because you don't
come.

3145
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:54,400
Yeah.
When I,

3146
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:54,980
when I,
when I,

3147
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:00,000
when I went on,
I start and stop and start and stop and 

3148
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,951
start and stop it.
I finally come that the pis like an 

3149
02:19:01,951 --> 02:19:01,951
animal,
um,

3150
02:19:01,951 --> 02:19:05,640
you know what I mean?
I think it just fucks you up a little 

3151
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:05,640
bit.
I don't know exactly what that is.

3152
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:05,640
I don't have.
So this is,

3153
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:07,720
but this is obviously something that you
don't like about yourself.

3154
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:09,250
I hate it,
I hate it,

3155
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:11,500
but I'm a huge joke or joke around about
it.

3156
02:19:11,501 --> 02:19:13,690
And you make a lot of comedy about it 
because it's there.

3157
02:19:13,691 --> 02:19:18,691
It's always present.
But if you ever thought about doing 

3158
02:19:18,691 --> 02:19:18,691
something to stop it.
Oh yeah.

3159
02:19:18,691 --> 02:19:18,691
Without a doubt,
man.

3160
02:19:18,691 --> 02:19:19,450
What would you do?
Um,

3161
02:19:19,451 --> 02:19:22,810
I would need to go to a certain 12 step 
meetings which I've attempted to go to.

3162
02:19:22,811 --> 02:19:27,811
I've gone to talk to people in those 
fellowships that get it and understand 

3163
02:19:27,811 --> 02:19:27,811
and don't go,
oh,

3164
02:19:27,811 --> 02:19:28,010
you're just

3165
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,090
a guy being a guy.
Like they get it man,

3166
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:30,680
like,
you know,

3167
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:34,520
um,
and I would have to just stop doing it.

3168
02:19:34,521 --> 02:19:38,510
Like it's really difficult because it's 
like you act out.

3169
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:39,620
Like if I drink,
I drank.

3170
02:19:39,621 --> 02:19:40,430
If I get high,
get high.

3171
02:19:40,431 --> 02:19:44,330
Of course I don't do those things.
But sexual shit of thought and it's like

3172
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:46,940
eat food is really hard because you have
to eat to live.

3173
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:48,770
But with sexual shit,
you know,

3174
02:19:48,771 --> 02:19:49,590
it's,
if I'm,

3175
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:52,220
if I start thinking at that trigger 
stuff and it's really,

3176
02:19:52,221 --> 02:19:55,520
really difficult to not fall into that 
pattern.

3177
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:58,530
I could offer you something.
Um,

3178
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:00,890
I could offer you,
I don't know if you could do it,

3179
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:04,340
but what you should think about doing is
an Iowaska session.

3180
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:06,390
What does that.
WASCO is a,

3181
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:11,400
is a shamanic session in Peru.
Usually they do it improve Brazil.

3182
02:20:11,481 --> 02:20:14,170
You could do it in America,
but it's not legal where you're.

3183
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:19,260
You're doing this a common atory 
psychedelic drug that allows you to look

3184
02:20:19,311 --> 02:20:24,311
at your life.
I couldn't look at all the issues that 

3185
02:20:24,311 --> 02:20:24,311
you have that's wrong.
That's not a drug like that.

3186
02:20:24,311 --> 02:20:25,580
It's not a drug like it gets you high 
and fucked up.

3187
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:26,800
It doesn't get you fucked up.
It,

3188
02:20:26,801 --> 02:20:29,990
it shows you what's going on with your 
life.

3189
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:32,470
It'll show you all the.
It's the recidivism rate,

3190
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:37,500
like the rate of fixing recidivism and 
things like a heroin addiction and it's 

3191
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:38,810
one of the best cures ever.
That one is another one.

3192
02:20:38,990 --> 02:20:40,850
And other psychedelic drug called 
Ibogaine.

3193
02:20:41,710 --> 02:20:46,710
I began,
if you know anything about hunter s 

3194
02:20:46,710 --> 02:20:48,551
Thompson,
that's what he accused Ed Muskie of 

3195
02:20:48,551 --> 02:20:48,551
being on during the,
uh,

3196
02:20:48,551 --> 02:20:52,340
it was in 1970 political campaigns.
He was a presidential campaigns.

3197
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:57,370
He was a,
he wrote some stories in the rolling 

3198
02:20:57,370 --> 02:20:59,411
stone saying that there was rumors that 
Ed Muskie had brought into Brazilian 

3199
02:20:59,411 --> 02:21:00,650
doctor and he was high on Ibogaine.

3200
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:03,760
That.
But I began is actually a different kind

3201
02:21:03,761 --> 02:21:07,160
of drug than what he was describing.
It's actually a self reflective drug,

3202
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:09,860
massively effective at curing people 
addictions.

3203
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:13,070
I have a friend who had a,
an oxycontin addiction and uh,

3204
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:14,780
he was really fucked up.
He had hurt his back,

3205
02:21:14,781 --> 02:21:17,690
started getting on Oxycontin's,
then developed a real problem.

3206
02:21:17,691 --> 02:21:21,740
It's incredibly physically addictive.
And he did Ibogaine once,

3207
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:23,720
cured him of,
he's never touched it since.

3208
02:21:23,721 --> 02:21:27,440
And now he runs a,
an Ibogaine center and helps people with

3209
02:21:27,441 --> 02:21:32,441
it.
This is the problem with me to a lot of 

3210
02:21:32,441 --> 02:21:34,181
it comes down to lack of willingness or 
a lack of willingness to act like I 

3211
02:21:34,181 --> 02:21:37,190
intellectually I know what I have to do,
but you have a pattern in your mind that

3212
02:21:37,191 --> 02:21:42,191
needs to be reset and you could reset 
your mind slowly over time or you can 

3213
02:21:42,191 --> 02:21:46,841
reset it in one big fucking dump of 
information like a dmt trip or like an 

3214
02:21:47,871 --> 02:21:48,650
Ibogaine trip.

3215
02:21:48,830 --> 02:21:53,060
And I know you have this,
you have this thing about not wanting to

3216
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:55,190
get high or not wanting to be 
intoxicated,

3217
02:21:55,640 --> 02:22:00,640
but I think you're thinking of a 
completely different effect than what 

3218
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:02,030
you're going to get on this,
on this experience.

3219
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:03,170
You might be right.
I just,

3220
02:22:03,171 --> 02:22:05,480
it scares me too much.
Like it's something you should be scared

3221
02:22:05,481 --> 02:22:10,481
of what you're doing though too.
Obviously you don't like it and you 

3222
02:22:10,481 --> 02:22:10,481
can't fix it.
Yeah,

3223
02:22:10,481 --> 02:22:10,481
absolutely.
I mean I,

3224
02:22:10,481 --> 02:22:11,210
but I can fix it.
It's a lack of.

3225
02:22:11,211 --> 02:22:13,550
Will it like.
It is a really weird thing that I,

3226
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:18,140
I know what the answer is and like I 
just like it too much.

3227
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:21,500
I like it too much and they said to 
think of liking.

3228
02:22:21,501 --> 02:22:23,090
Lust is weird,
but I like it.

3229
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,440
Okay.
But let me ask you this then.

3230
02:22:24,441 --> 02:22:26,070
What don't you like about it?
I don't

3231
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,470
like the fact that it distracts me.
It's consuming.

3232
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:30,980
I'm much more creative.
Without it I am,

3233
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:31,530
I'm,
I'm,

3234
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:34,590
I'm much more connected without it.
When I'm on it,

3235
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:39,710
I see I'm,
I'm always behind glass and I feel like 

3236
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:42,270
I'm not seeing any real human 
interaction at all,

3237
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:47,710
so it just overwhelmed Sukato completely
overwhelming and I make enough money 

3238
02:22:48,271 --> 02:22:49,700
where I can,
if I want to know.

3239
02:22:49,701 --> 02:22:50,730
Yeah,
I can't be stupid,

3240
02:22:50,731 --> 02:22:52,410
but I mean if I want to get a horse I 
can get a horse,

3241
02:22:52,411 --> 02:22:53,580
you know,
and I do.

3242
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:59,550
Do you think there's a way that you 
could ever just sort of manage it?

3243
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Is it,
is it a way where you can still indulge 

3244
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:05,610
and enjoy a little bit of sex but not 
let it overwhelm you?

3245
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:10,670
Sure.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

3246
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:10,670
with being kinky or having a 
relationship with dirty.

3247
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:10,810
Like I'm not looking to be,
you know,

3248
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,480
in and out through a sheet,
you know?

3249
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:14,820
I just don't want to be.
There's a difference between that.

3250
02:23:14,821 --> 02:23:19,821
I don't want to be obsessed.
I don't want to be obsessed with it and 

3251
02:23:19,821 --> 02:23:21,900
making it my whole point of existence.
That's just too much.

3252
02:23:22,050 --> 02:23:27,050
It don't get me wrong.
I'm sure you probably can cure it 

3253
02:23:27,050 --> 02:23:29,370
without a psychedelic assurance,
but in the way you're talking about it,

3254
02:23:29,371 --> 02:23:31,340
it sounds like a lot of other 
psychedelic,

3255
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:36,660
a lot of other.
I'm obsessive compulsive sort of things 

3256
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:38,090
that psychedelics can cure.
Maybe you don't.

3257
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:41,130
Maybe don't go to my free cams.
Have you been there yet?

3258
02:23:41,330 --> 02:23:43,350
No.
I go to [inaudible] dot com.

3259
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:45,390
Who Doesn't love some good consulting 
porn?

3260
02:23:45,410 --> 02:23:50,410
How challenging it is.
Coc holding everything that I wouldn't 

3261
02:23:51,091 --> 02:23:52,410
really want that though.
I like.

3262
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:55,500
I'll tell you what I love cold.
You wouldn't like that black guy to fuck

3263
02:23:55,501 --> 02:23:56,460
your woman in front of.
Never.

3264
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:59,160
Never tell you what I like about the 
movies.

3265
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:02,160
It's not necessarily the black guy 
fucking the woman.

3266
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:05,310
It's the husband being there and filming
it.

3267
02:24:05,330 --> 02:24:10,330
Like there's something that the dynamics
of that is so like if it's just a black 

3268
02:24:11,041 --> 02:24:11,850
guy,
fucking a woman,

3269
02:24:11,851 --> 02:24:14,580
like I don't really watch interracial 
porn so I can't relate to the coc in it.

3270
02:24:15,230 --> 02:24:19,230
When it's a husband watching,
it's all about the woman.

3271
02:24:19,231 --> 02:24:22,560
She's being so dirty and so 
inappropriate.

3272
02:24:23,010 --> 02:24:28,010
It makes me feel something and I think 
that's a problem is I'm so numb that 

3273
02:24:28,171 --> 02:24:31,680
like if I didn't do this shit for a 
while then I get my dick sucked.

3274
02:24:31,681 --> 02:24:33,210
It feels good,
but when you,

3275
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,460
when I'm fucking just won't leave my 
dick alone.

3276
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:41,480
Fucking I'm fucking wheatland my nipples
and trying to get a fucking disaster.

3277
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:45,720
It's a disaster.
You can get numb,

3278
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:50,930
totally numb.
So when I lay off for awhile then it 

3279
02:24:50,930 --> 02:24:50,930
feels good again.

3280
02:24:50,930 --> 02:24:53,220
Then I don't need to go there.
Then I don't need to go there.

3281
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:55,260
But yeah,
I do manage it to a certain degree.

3282
02:24:55,560 --> 02:25:00,560
Like I'm more responsible than I should 
be considering how fucking far gone I 

3283
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:04,521
am.
I'm much more careful than you think 

3284
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:10,070
that comes with being sober.
Like there are consequences I'm aware 

3285
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:10,070
of.
So I'm.

3286
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:11,160
You've been sober since you were like 
19,

3287
02:25:11,161 --> 02:25:12,600
18 years old.
Twenty six.

3288
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:13,770
That's crazy.
Yeah.

3289
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:18,780
That's a,
that's an amazing [inaudible] you gave 

3290
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:20,220
up on it real quick.
This is not for me.

3291
02:25:20,221 --> 02:25:20,670
You know?
Yeah.

3292
02:25:20,671 --> 02:25:24,070
If you rob see robbed three banks and 
every time

3293
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,900
one of your friends get shot and you go 
to jail,

3294
02:25:25,901 --> 02:25:27,820
he liked robin.
Banks is just not for me.

3295
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:29,830
That's what it was with this.
You can't do it.

3296
02:25:29,831 --> 02:25:33,250
Every time I do it there's a problem and
it's only gonna get worse and worse.

3297
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:38,280
Well,
I think that along the same lines of 

3298
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:40,201
your obsessive thing with sex,
you can get that obsessive with 

3299
02:25:40,201 --> 02:25:40,201
anything,
you know,

3300
02:25:40,201 --> 02:25:45,030
and it could be good.
Like you get that obsessed about 

3301
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:45,030
standup.
Yeah.

3302
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:45,820
You know,
I mean I think especially if you go back

3303
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:50,821
to your early days like you.
Do you remember like what it was like 

3304
02:25:50,821 --> 02:25:54,271
when you first get an onstage that was 
like really was like a drug you were 

3305
02:25:54,271 --> 02:25:54,280
seeking.
It was a high.

3306
02:25:54,670 --> 02:25:57,040
The thing is though,
it doesn't turn me into somebody I don't

3307
02:25:57,041 --> 02:25:58,900
like.
Whereas when I drink,

3308
02:25:58,930 --> 02:26:01,060
I'm an ugly,
angry drunk.

3309
02:26:01,061 --> 02:26:02,200
I'm a violent drunk.

3310
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:04,210
I'm a self destructive.
Physically drunk.

3311
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:05,910
Do you think you still would be?
I know it.

3312
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:11,550
I know there's not a doubt in my mind 
and I'm not giving the sobriety company 

3313
02:26:12,191 --> 02:26:14,950
line.
I just know how I think you know,

3314
02:26:14,951 --> 02:26:18,190
you and literally after I shot please be
offended,

3315
02:26:18,191 --> 02:26:22,330
which was over a year ago in Cleveland.
I wasn't happy with it and I'm like,

3316
02:26:22,331 --> 02:26:22,870
I just,
I'm like,

3317
02:26:22,890 --> 02:26:25,450
I just wanted to hang myself in the 
closet and I was like,

3318
02:26:25,451 --> 02:26:30,451
fuck.
I put a belt up and I wasn't going to 

3319
02:26:30,451 --> 02:26:30,451
do.
I knew I wasn't gonna do it.

3320
02:26:30,451 --> 02:26:30,451
You put a belt on.
Yeah.

3321
02:26:30,451 --> 02:26:30,460
Yeah.
But I knew I wouldn't do it.

3322
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:33,640
This is not some psychotic cry for help.
I knew it wasn't gonna happen,

3323
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:35,770
but I was so mad at myself.
I'm like,

3324
02:26:35,771 --> 02:26:40,771
you fucking stink.
That I all I could think about was just 

3325
02:26:40,771 --> 02:26:41,200
that feeling of my fucking throat being 
cut off.

3326
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:42,610
But I,
I,

3327
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:47,760
I wound up editing the special with 
people and then liking it once it came 

3328
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:50,740
out a little bit and then I saw it 
recently and I'm like,

3329
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:51,910
it was good.
Like what?

3330
02:26:51,911 --> 02:26:52,930
What's wrong with you?
You Fuck?

3331
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:54,760
Like,
I liked it a lot more.

3332
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:58,750
This one I actually am very,
very happy with immediately,

3333
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:04,020
but the other one,
it took a while and I think I had just 

3334
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:06,360
been doing the material a little longer 
than I should have and by that I was 

3335
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:06,360
done with it.
That does happen.

3336
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:07,840
How long had you been doing that 
material?

3337
02:27:07,841 --> 02:27:08,620
For?
How many years?

3338
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:09,730
Not Too.
Too Long.

3339
02:27:09,731 --> 02:27:10,470
A couple of year.
I mean,

3340
02:27:10,471 --> 02:27:11,140
you know.
Yeah,

3341
02:27:11,141 --> 02:27:13,030
maybe,
but this one I shot 10 months later.

3342
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:15,400
I was ready to get this one.
I still,

3343
02:27:15,490 --> 02:27:18,390
I missed the material now.
Like I loved doing it so.

3344
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:19,360
But I know how crazy.

3345
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:22,540
I think in irrational and moment.
It's why I don't own a pistol.

3346
02:27:22,541 --> 02:27:27,541
It's why I don't know because I know I 
would have that one moment that you can 

3347
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:27,541
take back.
Yeah.

3348
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:32,521
I have a real similar problems.
I don't think it's as extreme as you 

3349
02:27:32,521 --> 02:27:34,240
don't have a problem with drinking or 
with drugs,

3350
02:27:34,510 --> 02:27:37,630
but I do have a lot of extremity,
a lot of,

3351
02:27:37,631 --> 02:27:42,631
uh,
I have a lot of impulses and a lot of 

3352
02:27:42,631 --> 02:27:42,790
craziness,
but I keep it under wraps.

3353
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:48,140
Right.
That's one of the reasons why I have to 

3354
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:48,140
work out.
I work out on a regular basis,

3355
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:49,570
like I need discipline in my life in 
order to keep order.

3356
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,220
Right.
But if I got like that,

3357
02:27:51,250 --> 02:27:56,250
whether it was jerking off or if I got 
into a drug or became like super 

3358
02:27:56,531 --> 02:28:01,531
impulsive like that,
I'd like to think that I'd be able to 

3359
02:28:01,531 --> 02:28:06,061
pull myself back because my objective,
because I looked at myself and I'm 

3360
02:28:06,061 --> 02:28:08,970
self-analyze lot but,
but I'm not that confident and it's one 

3361
02:28:08,970 --> 02:28:09,550
of the reasons why I've never touched 
anything really addictive.

3362
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,200
Yeah.
Besides alcohol,

3363
02:28:11,230 --> 02:28:15,220
which isn't addictive to me,
but I've never fucked with anything that

3364
02:28:15,221 --> 02:28:17,590
could get you.
Like Anthony's a fun drunk.

3365
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:21,980
Anthony Columbia is a fun drunk.
I am not a

3366
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,540
fun drunk.
I'm not.

3367
02:28:23,541 --> 02:28:28,541
I'm sorry.
I just have so much different than you 

3368
02:28:28,541 --> 02:28:28,541
were when you were 18 to.
All right.

3369
02:28:28,541 --> 02:28:32,170
That's very true.
But because so many of these other 

3370
02:28:32,170 --> 02:28:34,241
feelings are still there,
like I'm the drunk that all of a sudden 

3371
02:28:34,241 --> 02:28:35,120
after four beers,
my nose is down,

3372
02:28:35,121 --> 02:28:37,500
but my eyes are up and I looked like a 
fucking,

3373
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:39,080
like,
give us remembering the shiny.

3374
02:28:39,081 --> 02:28:40,670
When Nicholson's wearing the maroon 
coat,

3375
02:28:40,671 --> 02:28:42,830
that psych,
that's the look I have.

3376
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:44,420
And um,
I,

3377
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:45,680
I just don't trust it.
And the,

3378
02:28:45,681 --> 02:28:48,550
and the price to pay is just too much 
and it's not worth it.

3379
02:28:48,551 --> 02:28:49,190
And nobody knows

3380
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,340
better than you.
My friend tastes the same way.

3381
02:28:51,341 --> 02:28:52,210
He says,
I can't,

3382
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:54,220
we can't do anything,
can't smoke a joint,

3383
02:28:54,221 --> 02:28:55,270
can't do it.
He goes,

3384
02:28:55,770 --> 02:29:00,770
it might be great,
but then I might wake up three days 

3385
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:00,770
later not knowing how the fuck I got 
there.

3386
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:00,770
And I don't miss it.
I,

3387
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:01,980
I don't,
but I don't knock it either.

3388
02:29:01,981 --> 02:29:06,981
Like,
like you smoke pot and you have to run 

3389
02:29:06,981 --> 02:29:06,981
this career.
You're driven.

3390
02:29:06,981 --> 02:29:07,680
You're a,
I think the best announcer in sports.

3391
02:29:07,681 --> 02:29:08,810
You have an amazing,
like a,

3392
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:13,850
literally your life is very,
very professional and functional and 

3393
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:14,100
healthy.
You have a wife and kid,

3394
02:29:14,130 --> 02:29:17,940
like you do all these things and smoke 
pot and like for you,

3395
02:29:17,941 --> 02:29:21,990
it's cool if I could do that gladly,
but I can't.

3396
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:23,610
I just,
I know I can't,

3397
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:24,560
not for any,
you know,

3398
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:26,040
whatever.
We're just wired differently,

3399
02:29:26,590 --> 02:29:29,020
wired differently and people need to 
really recognize that.

3400
02:29:29,350 --> 02:29:30,310
Uh,
I think it's,

3401
02:29:30,311 --> 02:29:32,980
it's a,
it's a really important point for me.

3402
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:35,380
It helps me,
keeps me calm,

3403
02:29:35,381 --> 02:29:38,230
makes me nicer.
It makes me more relaxed so I wouldn't,

3404
02:29:38,231 --> 02:29:40,180
I wouldn't be productive stones.
Like,

3405
02:29:40,181 --> 02:29:40,870
you're productive.

3406
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:43,660
Do you smoke a joint and come in and 
talk for three hours?

3407
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,890
If I didn't,
if I smoke,

3408
02:29:44,891 --> 02:29:47,710
if I took two hits to that,
I'll just look at the microphone.

3409
02:29:48,460 --> 02:29:50,110
Fucking dunce.
I would do nothing.

3410
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:51,110
Yeah,
because you don't,

3411
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:53,300
but you don't need it for whatever it 
is.

3412
02:29:53,301 --> 02:29:58,301
It's for me.
It gives me a perspective that's not 

3413
02:29:58,301 --> 02:29:58,730
available without the pot.
I can,

3414
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:03,760
I can get.
I mean obviously I can get 

3415
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:05,891
introspective.
I can think about things deeply without 

3416
02:30:05,891 --> 02:30:07,160
any help.
I don't need any marijuana or drugs,

3417
02:30:07,161 --> 02:30:08,570
but,
but when I take them,

3418
02:30:08,571 --> 02:30:13,571
I often feel like there's windows that 
are open that wouldn't be open 

3419
02:30:13,571 --> 02:30:13,571
ordinarily.
I mean,

3420
02:30:13,571 --> 02:30:18,521
Carl Sagan had a quote about that.
Let me see if I can remember it because 

3421
02:30:18,521 --> 02:30:21,140
it's a fascinating quote because Carl 
Sagan is one of my favorite.

3422
02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:22,030
Oh,
is great.

3423
02:30:22,340 --> 02:30:24,680
Science Katz,
who's a bad motherfucker.

3424
02:30:24,681 --> 02:30:29,681
This is what he said.
I am convinced that there are genuine 

3425
02:30:29,681 --> 02:30:32,111
and valid levels of perception available
with cannabis and probably other drugs 

3426
02:30:32,111 --> 02:30:36,461
which are through the defects of our 
society and our educational system 

3427
02:30:36,461 --> 02:30:37,190
unavailable to us without such drugs.

3428
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:38,960
It's an interesting quote.
Yeah,

3429
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:41,570
but that's just me.
It's probably correct.

3430
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:46,720
For me.
Marijuana lets me know what I actually 

3431
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:46,720
want.
Like it sounds ridiculous,

3432
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:48,380
but when I get high,
if I.

3433
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:51,080
If I enjoy something when I'm high,
then I really enjoy it.

3434
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,290
But if I get high and I'm like,
get me away from this fucking thing,

3435
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:57,320
usually that's my actual feelings about 
it.

3436
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:01,130
Whether it's with people or whether it 
enhances what,

3437
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:06,340
how I already feel about certain people 
enhances already feel about food or 

3438
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:07,730
about sex or.
But that's just me,

3439
02:31:08,390 --> 02:31:09,340
you know,
that's.

3440
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:14,360
I took me till I was 30 before I 
realized that even worked for me right 

3441
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:15,620
before that.
I thought it was all for idiots.

3442
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:16,620
Yeah,
man,

3443
02:31:16,621 --> 02:31:17,190
I,
and again,

3444
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:17,840
I,
I,

3445
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:20,280
I wish I could do it,
but I,

3446
02:31:20,281 --> 02:31:22,440
I'm okay with the fact that I can't,
like,

3447
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:27,890
I would like to manage the sec shit 
better because I'm a better person when 

3448
02:31:27,890 --> 02:31:29,730
I'm not doing it.
I'm a more connected person,

3449
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:35,030
like I care about people,
but I can become very uncaring and very 

3450
02:31:35,030 --> 02:31:37,680
distracted and very distant when I'm in 
that mode because it's addiction.

3451
02:31:37,710 --> 02:31:40,830
It's like any other addiction.
You're not present.

3452
02:31:40,870 --> 02:31:42,150
And I think that it makes me not 
present.

3453
02:31:42,330 --> 02:31:43,860
That's the,
that's the big point.

3454
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:46,620
And that's what people don't have.
An addiction will never understand.

3455
02:31:46,830 --> 02:31:48,640
I've had many addictions.
Uh,

3456
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:53,750
I've had a lot of video game problems,
behavioral type shit that really is just

3457
02:31:54,931 --> 02:31:59,931
like a drug addiction.
It becomes an addiction of video game 

3458
02:31:59,931 --> 02:32:02,721
addiction.
Might as well be a drug addiction and 

3459
02:32:02,721 --> 02:32:02,721
it's really similar to a sexual 
addiction.

3460
02:32:02,721 --> 02:32:05,640
It focuses you on something outside.
It gets to zone out.

3461
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:10,450
Sometimes it's just zone out.
It's just the feeling numb,

3462
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:14,260
the numbness and it's like,
I like to think and I like to create and

3463
02:32:14,261 --> 02:32:16,170
I like to fucking sit at my computer and
write.

3464
02:32:16,470 --> 02:32:19,320
This is how it a fucking pervert.
Like when I wrote my books,

3465
02:32:19,321 --> 02:32:21,450
the second book especially I wrote at 
the comedy cellar.

3466
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:25,200
I would come up with stuff and I would 
write it in the cellar because it was.

3467
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:27,930
I was surrounded by people so I couldn't
jerk off.

3468
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:31,270
Like I had to be in a public place to 
sit on my laptop and right,

3469
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:32,490
like,
you know what I mean?

3470
02:32:32,491 --> 02:32:34,180
I would just be in the corner writing 
because I couldn't.

3471
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:39,190
I could do enough instant messaging like
talk dirty so I could get a little 

3472
02:32:39,190 --> 02:32:40,410
dopamine drip,
but I couldn't go the extra route,

3473
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:44,390
which was the fucking Yank out my Dick,
my Dick soft.

3474
02:32:44,570 --> 02:32:46,530
I'm just yanking it against my dumb 
stomach,

3475
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:47,820
zone out,
zone out,

3476
02:32:47,821 --> 02:32:48,660
zone out,
click,

3477
02:32:48,690 --> 02:32:50,460
zone out.
Nothing real.

3478
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:52,830
Nothing to feeling good.
How many times a day would you say?

3479
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:57,920
I wouldn't even come all day.
Have you ever thought about taking a 

3480
02:32:57,920 --> 02:32:58,470
laptop and disabling the Wifi 
connection?

3481
02:32:58,530 --> 02:32:59,440
You could do that,
you know,

3482
02:32:59,490 --> 02:33:01,800
you can,
but I needed it for research and I liked

3483
02:33:01,801 --> 02:33:05,300
him being gay with the fucking research 
because bashing public figures,

3484
02:33:05,301 --> 02:33:06,910
so I had to.
Oh,

3485
02:33:06,911 --> 02:33:08,590
like I was shocked and yeah.
Yeah.

3486
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:14,260
And sometimes you need that for 
reference and I also liked the 

3487
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:14,260
distraction of it because it puts less 
pressure on me.

3488
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:16,430
Like even if it's on watching black 
sabbath videos,

3489
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:21,460
I'll go on youtube and watch Sabbath 
live in fucking to Melbourne again 

3490
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:24,891
because I feel like watching Ozzie 
saying God is dead for the front and 

3491
02:33:24,891 --> 02:33:24,891
that will distract me from it.

3492
02:33:24,891 --> 02:33:24,930
And then creatively like,
oh,

3493
02:33:24,931 --> 02:33:29,931
okay.
It allows me to step away for a second 

3494
02:33:29,931 --> 02:33:29,931
mentally because I'm just forcing myself
know,

3495
02:33:29,990 --> 02:33:31,200
write,
I can't write.

3496
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:35,220
Have you ever thought about trying some 
other form of discipline,

3497
02:33:35,221 --> 02:33:36,960
like yoga or something along those 
lines?

3498
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:42,170
Yeah,
I would say that yoga would keep you 

3499
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:44,301
from being a sex addict,
but the fucking head of beef crumbs is 

3500
02:33:44,301 --> 02:33:47,991
getting sued like a motherfucker for 
rape and sexual assault and driving a 

3501
02:33:47,991 --> 02:33:49,110
Rolls Royce,
a bunch of shit.

3502
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:51,990
This guy's fucking crazy gangster.
You ever seen pictures of them?

3503
02:33:52,410 --> 02:33:57,410
Yeah,
I've seen one photo of him be grown sex 

3504
02:33:57,410 --> 02:33:58,080
scandal,
something like that.

3505
02:33:58,290 --> 02:34:00,990
He dresses like a pimp and almost 
literally.

3506
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:02,870
How do you fucking not become a sex side
when?

3507
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:05,550
When the girl in front of you was 
wearing cellophane pants and her fucking

3508
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:08,850
Qantas jumping out at you?
It looks like Al Jolson's face.

3509
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:11,670
How do you not get turned on by that?
That's not him.

3510
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:13,080
Is that him?
Yeah.

3511
02:34:13,081 --> 02:34:15,510
That's not the image I was thinking of,
but that's a good one.

3512
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:18,130
Just thinking about him slinging and 
Indian Dick all

3513
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:19,510
over that room.
Oh,

3514
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:22,960
yoga is good.
I've tried.

3515
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:27,430
Working out has helped a little bit like
it makes me feel better about myself.

3516
02:34:27,431 --> 02:34:30,250
I'm more comfortable and confident like 
you know where I want to be,

3517
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:34,150
but I'm much better than I was,
so it's like I feel like I see results.

3518
02:34:34,210 --> 02:34:36,670
I bet if you did yoga four or five days 
a week,

3519
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:39,200
you could fucking hold on.
I bet you could hold on.

3520
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:42,370
I think I roommate take off all the 
doors in your place.

3521
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:45,720
Probably just be jerking off in front of
each other.

3522
02:34:45,721 --> 02:34:50,721
After a while they would just sit back 
to back like a fucking Rom composter 

3523
02:34:50,721 --> 02:34:52,320
juggling at the same laptop.
Do you think that like prisoners,

3524
02:34:52,490 --> 02:34:55,430
they not jerk off because there's other 
prisoners around it.

3525
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:58,410
Just fucking do it just.
Well,

3526
02:34:58,510 --> 02:35:01,110
you talked to guys that worked at 
prisons and they'll say they peaking the

3527
02:35:01,111 --> 02:35:06,111
cells and dudes just jacking it,
like looking right at him after a while 

3528
02:35:06,111 --> 02:35:07,470
they just give up.
You just get used to it.

3529
02:35:07,710 --> 02:35:12,710
Yeah.
That's the human mind is so strange as 

3530
02:35:12,710 --> 02:35:15,741
far as like what really gets us in some,
gets us on a track and now it's so 

3531
02:35:15,741 --> 02:35:18,390
difficult to get off that track and that
obsession.

3532
02:35:18,570 --> 02:35:23,570
Like they just constantly wanting to 
find another video or another video or 

3533
02:35:23,570 --> 02:35:23,940
another video.
So it's a weird

3534
02:35:23,990 --> 02:35:28,990
Dang man did this to me.
It's maybe five or six times a day,

3535
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:32,340
but it's like those camp sites and 
these,

3536
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:33,380
these,
uh,

3537
02:35:33,650 --> 02:35:36,470
amateur video sites like submit your 
flicks.

3538
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:39,110
It's just like gold.
It's like nonstop.

3539
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:40,700
Yeah,
you're just not as self aware as he is.

3540
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:45,730
You're not trying to fix yourself.
Realizing that he's a mess and you're 

3541
02:35:45,730 --> 02:35:45,730
like,
I'm perfect.

3542
02:35:45,730 --> 02:35:48,120
I did the uh,
I usually try to do it right when I wake

3543
02:35:48,121 --> 02:35:48,170
up.

3544
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:49,120
Yup.
And I did the,

3545
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:54,121
uh,
where I didn't wash my hands good 

3546
02:35:54,121 --> 02:35:55,711
enough.
And I was at starbucks and I had a 

3547
02:35:55,711 --> 02:35:55,711
little bit of a lotion still on my hand 
when I was paying

3548
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,100
fluffy.
Oh fuck that.

3549
02:35:57,580 --> 02:35:58,690
Good boy.
Good for you.

3550
02:35:58,691 --> 02:35:59,790
Fuck that.
Fuck.

3551
02:35:59,850 --> 02:36:02,050
Watching the lotion on your hands.
Get to the Guidestar,

3552
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:05,170
but he's not going to discuss that.
You're going to talk about the times you

3553
02:36:05,171 --> 02:36:07,900
slimed people,
but I can't get onto the morning.

3554
02:36:07,901 --> 02:36:09,140
I can't do.
I'm not sexual activity.

3555
02:36:09,150 --> 02:36:11,500
Busy clearing out my sinuses and my had 
nothing.

3556
02:36:11,501 --> 02:36:13,150
I don't want to fuck in the morning.
I want to talk.

3557
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:15,880
I smelled your load once.
Remember you picked it out of your belly

3558
02:36:15,881 --> 02:36:17,550
button.
Oh yeah.

3559
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:20,390
From the night before.
And he knows you're welcome.

3560
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:23,920
It's one thing if you smell your own,
which is pretty disgusting,

3561
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:29,080
but when you smell other people's.
I know I'm a disgusting person when I,

3562
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:31,270
when I jerk off and I don't even bother 
cleaning up,

3563
02:36:31,271 --> 02:36:35,020
I just wipe it with my underwear and put
them right back in my underwear and then

3564
02:36:35,021 --> 02:36:40,021
I get up in the morning and take a leak 
and I smell it usually on the road 

3565
02:36:40,021 --> 02:36:43,110
maintenance jerking off and then I get 
up in the morning on the road to Piss 

3566
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:43,110
and I lift up the toilet and pull my 
dick out.

3567
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:46,370
My what is,
that's just like,

3568
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:47,890
like the.
Yeah,

3569
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:53,340
like the banks of a polluted river.
It's so gross.

3570
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:57,910
Wipe it right off live and right off 
comes right off.

3571
02:36:58,810 --> 02:37:03,810
If you could,
if you could fix one aspect of yourself 

3572
02:37:03,810 --> 02:37:07,050
though,
that's the thing that you would like to 

3573
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:07,050
get on track?
Absolutely.

3574
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:09,871
Because I think it stops me career wise.
Like I have a good career where like I 

3575
02:37:09,871 --> 02:37:10,950
enjoy where I'm at,
but it's,

3576
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:15,980
it,
it allows me to stagnate on a level 

3577
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:16,190
where I should

3578
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:21,190
not be stagnating and it permits me to 
be comfortable where I shouldn't be 

3579
02:37:21,190 --> 02:37:22,330
comfortable and it's like a little 
safety signal,

3580
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:26,210
little security blanket where it 
shouldn't be about getting maybe like,

3581
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:31,240
you know,
like a cock lock or one of those 

3582
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:31,600
chastity belt locks where he has a key 
and you turn them on.

3583
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:34,500
You had to find something about that.
I would just get Mr to put a strap on,

3584
02:37:34,501 --> 02:37:35,900
on and spit on me,
you know,

3585
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:38,960
always.
There's always a way.

3586
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:40,700
Do you still like that shit?
Like you're,

3587
02:37:40,701 --> 02:37:41,080
you're,
like,

3588
02:37:41,090 --> 02:37:43,580
you're in a dominatrix isn't sexy.
I mean,

3589
02:37:43,581 --> 02:37:45,530
I haven't,
I haven't in a while,

3590
02:37:45,531 --> 02:37:47,000
but uh,
they can be very sexy.

3591
02:37:47,001 --> 02:37:47,580
Sure.
If they're,

3592
02:37:47,581 --> 02:37:49,810
they're good.
If they know what they're doing,

3593
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:51,830
if they're just like the whole dirtiness
of it.

3594
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:53,600
Absolutely.
Man,

3595
02:37:53,601 --> 02:37:57,230
I love the perversion.
I love a woman who can read me.

3596
02:37:57,560 --> 02:38:00,260
Every guy wants to be owned,
whether you're dominant or submissive,

3597
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:03,860
and when a woman can read me and 
anticipate what I want,

3598
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:07,830
I love that.
So fired up,

3599
02:38:07,890 --> 02:38:10,130
but it's hot man.
Just enjoy that though.

3600
02:38:10,210 --> 02:38:11,990
Why?
Why does it have to be an obsession?

3601
02:38:12,110 --> 02:38:14,780
Is Is there a balance that can be 
achieved here?

3602
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:17,780
Yeah,
you can just enjoy the sex and sexuality

3603
02:38:17,781 --> 02:38:20,060
and just not tweak on all day.
It's greed.

3604
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:25,300
It's being greedy.
It's wanting one as they say more than 

3605
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:27,701
my share.
Twenty more than my share of pleasure 

3606
02:38:27,701 --> 02:38:30,190
and more than my share of experiences.
It's walk into a candy store and not 

3607
02:38:30,190 --> 02:38:33,821
picking a candy bar.
It's grabbing for everything and then 

3608
02:38:33,821 --> 02:38:34,430
shoving it into my fucking face and the 
crime that I have a stomach ache,

3609
02:38:34,610 --> 02:38:37,640
but you've got enough discipline to work
out and lose all this weight like you've

3610
02:38:37,641 --> 02:38:40,580
changed your body over the last six 
months or a year or so.

3611
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:43,160
How many?
How much weight have you lost?

3612
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:46,040
I mean in the last year I'd say close to
30.

3613
02:38:46,170 --> 02:38:47,630
Your face,
your body,

3614
02:38:47,631 --> 02:38:49,290
everything looks totally different.
Yeah.

3615
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:49,680
Well,
yeah.

3616
02:38:49,780 --> 02:38:50,920
It's.
It's a overall.

3617
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:53,190
I was,
I think I'm like one 46,000,

3618
02:38:53,230 --> 02:38:55,460
47.
I was at one point,

3619
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:57,800
I was tapping out a lot in the one 
sixties,

3620
02:38:57,801 --> 02:38:59,930
hitting one seventies at one point a 
couple years ago,

3621
02:38:59,931 --> 02:39:01,230
few years ago.
I was in the eighties,

3622
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:04,190
I suppose to have pictures of myself.
I want a fucking oinker.

3623
02:39:04,410 --> 02:39:08,000
I was really disgusting,
but it's good to remember that stuff and

3624
02:39:08,001 --> 02:39:13,001
uh,
I feel much better to my eating's on 

3625
02:39:13,001 --> 02:39:13,001
that.
Perfect.

3626
02:39:13,001 --> 02:39:15,690
You know,
but it's nice though to get that under 

3627
02:39:15,690 --> 02:39:15,690
wraps,
right?

3628
02:39:15,690 --> 02:39:18,660
Acute.
You've handled that one aspect of your 

3629
02:39:18,660 --> 02:39:20,501
physicality getting out of control.
But I have at least a pattern that's 

3630
02:39:20,501 --> 02:39:23,951
healthy for it.
And I got a trainer sessions at least 

3631
02:39:23,951 --> 02:39:23,951
three,
sometimes four days a week,

3632
02:39:23,951 --> 02:39:23,951
so yeah.

3633
02:39:23,951 --> 02:39:25,430
Yeah.
Well maybe you could figure out a way to

3634
02:39:25,431 --> 02:39:28,010
just get another pattern,
you know.

3635
02:39:28,011 --> 02:39:31,040
Isn't that something that your mother 
told you replace something bad with?

3636
02:39:31,390 --> 02:39:33,380
Did you know Dr Phil said that.
It's funny.

3637
02:39:33,381 --> 02:39:36,200
My mother on my second cd left that 
voicemail and she was right.

3638
02:39:36,201 --> 02:39:36,920
Jimmy.
I was like,

3639
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:39,230
why don't you go to the gym,
get to meet a nice girl?

3640
02:39:39,231 --> 02:39:40,900
And she was right.
Bible.

3641
02:39:40,930 --> 02:39:44,190
I have a fucking fart brewing right now.
It's going to be.

3642
02:39:44,270 --> 02:39:46,940
I'm going to do it in the car with 
Jonathan.

3643
02:39:46,941 --> 02:39:51,941
It's going to be fucking hang in there 
like much bigger.

3644
02:39:52,641 --> 02:39:57,641
You are in this picture.
This was in Vegas when Opie and Anthony 

3645
02:39:57,641 --> 02:39:57,641
was in Vegas.
So what year was this?

3646
02:39:57,641 --> 02:40:00,350
Like 2003.
I have a lot fatter than that.

3647
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:01,310
Look up.
Uh,

3648
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:02,930
I mean that was,
that was even,

3649
02:40:03,380 --> 02:40:06,020
that was fantastic.
I asked me a Deacon Jones.

3650
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:08,350
I love that photo.
Yeah.

3651
02:40:08,390 --> 02:40:09,990
I was a fucking pig there,
but not.

3652
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:11,120
That was in Vegas too,
right?

3653
02:40:11,121 --> 02:40:12,500
Yeah,
he was hanging out with some in Vegas.

3654
02:40:12,501 --> 02:40:13,070
I remember that.

3655
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:17,970
That was a fun show that Vegas Vegas to 
California as a California public.

3656
02:40:18,470 --> 02:40:20,760
Like the poker thing?
Yeah.

3657
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:22,470
The poker thing.
That was when Anthony was playing,

3658
02:40:22,471 --> 02:40:22,920
right?
Yep.

3659
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:26,210
Fun Times.
And Lp stepped on fasteners.

3660
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:28,170
Cake.
Theoretically.

3661
02:40:28,171 --> 02:40:29,140
Some metaphoric.
Yeah.

3662
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:33,240
And asked her to call them a destroyer.
Hilarious.

3663
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:34,070
Yeah,
it was funny.

3664
02:40:34,230 --> 02:40:35,730
That was really fun.
The,

3665
02:40:35,731 --> 02:40:36,800
um,
that,

3666
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:39,610
those shows that you guys used to do,
how come you guys stopped doing those,

3667
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:41,660
those big comedy shows?
Um,

3668
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:42,660
it just became,
well,

3669
02:40:42,661 --> 02:40:44,970
we lost terrestrial radio,
which I was happy for it,

3670
02:40:44,971 --> 02:40:49,971
but it became harder to do and it became
harder to get guys booked and now we 

3671
02:40:49,971 --> 02:40:50,790
just,
it just went away.

3672
02:40:50,810 --> 02:40:54,120
The merger happened and things changed 
once we merged,

3673
02:40:54,121 --> 02:40:56,670
there was disadvantages to it and 
there's advantages to it.

3674
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:58,100
Um,
you know,

3675
02:40:58,110 --> 02:41:02,460
I liked being in our old studio at Xm.
I liked the thing about Sirius I like is

3676
02:41:02,461 --> 02:41:04,920
the guests we can get are much better 
because already in the building.

3677
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:07,470
So a lot of times we get people that we 
would not have gotten ever.

3678
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:08,730
Um,
you know,

3679
02:41:08,731 --> 02:41:13,731
there's been some great.
We're open to a much larger group of 

3680
02:41:13,731 --> 02:41:13,731
people now.
So,

3681
02:41:13,731 --> 02:41:14,380
you know,
the good with the bad.

3682
02:41:14,490 --> 02:41:16,260
Do you know what your numbers are?
No idea.

3683
02:41:16,261 --> 02:41:18,150
I probably could find out,
but I don't ask.

3684
02:41:18,151 --> 02:41:20,160
I just don't want to know because I 
don't wanna be disappointed.

3685
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:21,090
Um,
I just,

3686
02:41:21,091 --> 02:41:26,091
I don't know.
I know I have a decent amount of 

3687
02:41:26,091 --> 02:41:26,290
followers and decent amount of fans.
Um,

3688
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:31,520
I've,
I have no fucking idea what I mean as 

3689
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:31,520
far as like how many people listened to 
know,

3690
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:33,150
kill me every day.
I don't even know how we'd find that out

3691
02:41:33,151 --> 02:41:35,130
because they know arbitron diary.
I think they do,

3692
02:41:35,131 --> 02:41:39,930
but they don't want to tell us because 
we sent out surveys tuned in you,

3693
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:43,440
you have to be tuned into that frequency
or that it doesn't tell you that way.

3694
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:48,510
Nah,
I think through a lot of times they 

3695
02:41:48,510 --> 02:41:48,510
could do listeners surveys,
but uh,

3696
02:41:48,510 --> 02:41:49,500
which I guess work like arbitron 
diaries,

3697
02:41:49,501 --> 02:41:50,370
but I don't know,
man.

3698
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:51,690
So antiquated,
isn't it?

3699
02:41:51,790 --> 02:41:54,690
That's shitty.
Do I really think that if you weren't on

3700
02:41:54,691 --> 02:41:59,691
it,
you would have the biggest fucking 

3701
02:41:59,691 --> 02:41:59,691
podcast in the world?
Oh No,

3702
02:41:59,691 --> 02:41:59,800
I don't think you'd have a huge podcast.
I feel like I've been,

3703
02:41:59,870 --> 02:42:00,550
I,
I'm,

3704
02:42:00,551 --> 02:42:01,620
I'm not fishing.
I really mean like,

3705
02:42:01,621 --> 02:42:03,210
I feel like I'm boring when I talked to 
a lot.

3706
02:42:03,211 --> 02:42:08,211
I just,
can't I fuck it wouldn't be out of my 

3707
02:42:08,211 --> 02:42:08,211
mind.
I like to snipe.

3708
02:42:08,211 --> 02:42:11,091
I like to fucking sit there and watch 
fucking Greg and Tony do the heavy 

3709
02:42:11,091 --> 02:42:11,970
lifting and I pipe in with,
like you said,

3710
02:42:11,971 --> 02:42:14,310
the fucking quick shot or I fucking,
I'm the,

3711
02:42:14,311 --> 02:42:16,290
I'm the fucking sniper and full metal 
jacket.

3712
02:42:16,530 --> 02:42:21,530
I'll just shoot a few bullets and then 
sit back and let them do the heavy 

3713
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:21,530
lifting and I liked that.

3714
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:21,850
Well you guys have a great relationship 
to.

3715
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:23,340
You guys have been doing it together so 
long,

3716
02:42:23,370 --> 02:42:25,410
but I think if the three of you build 
together,

3717
02:42:25,740 --> 02:42:27,210
it would just,
you could still.

3718
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:29,700
I think you could maintain the exact 
same amount of income.

3719
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:33,060
I think it'd be the exact same amount of
people listening if not more,

3720
02:42:33,290 --> 02:42:38,290
just.
I think that's the future being Anthony 

3721
02:42:38,290 --> 02:42:38,290
podcast.
Yeah,

3722
02:42:38,290 --> 02:42:38,750
I was just about bringing that.
Yes,

3723
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:40,100
we do the podcast.
So,

3724
02:42:40,101 --> 02:42:41,370
uh,
and how does that work?

3725
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:47,000
They just go on,
it's on itunes and a lot of times it's 

3726
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:47,390
best of the week plus a couple of old 
bits are a part.

3727
02:42:47,820 --> 02:42:49,230
Yeah,
there's an old bit in there.

3728
02:42:49,270 --> 02:42:54,270
It's basically just to get people 
because they don't want to give away 

3729
02:42:54,270 --> 02:42:57,081
content either.
It's just to get people who have heard 

3730
02:42:57,081 --> 02:42:57,540
of the show to check it out and see if 
they like it.

3731
02:42:57,800 --> 02:43:00,360
Um,
but a lot of times the fans already have

3732
02:43:00,390 --> 02:43:02,010
the content because they've heard it 
already.

3733
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:03,720
Well,
I'm going to tell you this man,

3734
02:43:03,721 --> 02:43:08,721
if it wasn't for you guys,
I don't think I would've ever started a 

3735
02:43:08,721 --> 02:43:11,421
podcast.
And if it wasn't for Anthony Anthony 

3736
02:43:11,421 --> 02:43:12,400
doing live from the compound,
Brian and I would've never started doing

3737
02:43:12,401 --> 02:43:17,401
that.
Ustream show this show that kind of 

3738
02:43:17,401 --> 02:43:17,401
started it out.
And before that,

3739
02:43:17,401 --> 02:43:18,040
the uh,
was the Justin TV.

3740
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:19,690
We did a few of those.
Yeah,

3741
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:21,130
we did a few of those in the green 
rooms.

3742
02:43:21,131 --> 02:43:23,830
Like we kind of had an idea of doing 
something like this a long time ago.

3743
02:43:23,831 --> 02:43:28,831
But seeing anthony do it from his place 
really motivated me because anthony set 

3744
02:43:28,831 --> 02:43:33,821
up a green screen and put a professional
desk in there and had professional 

3745
02:43:33,821 --> 02:43:35,770
microphones and cameras.
I mean he really went balls out.

3746
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:40,890
He told me he spent like a stupid amount
of money to convert the downstairs of 

3747
02:43:40,890 --> 02:43:41,320
his house until the recording studio.

3748
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:45,310
And this is a guy already has a fucking 
full time gig and if you never seen live

3749
02:43:45,311 --> 02:43:50,311
for the compound,
he did some with his ex girlfriend 

3750
02:43:50,311 --> 02:43:52,360
Melissa,
where he would get fucking shit faced.

3751
02:43:52,361 --> 02:43:57,361
Hammered.
He would do karaoke while holding a 

3752
02:43:57,361 --> 02:43:57,361
machine gun.
Yeah,

3753
02:43:57,361 --> 02:44:00,970
he.
He was hammered and he would take calls.

3754
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:03,850
I called him once he was on,
I was watching.

3755
02:44:03,851 --> 02:44:05,080
I was like,
this is amazing.

3756
02:44:05,081 --> 02:44:07,150
And he was just hammered,
hammered,

3757
02:44:07,151 --> 02:44:09,130
drinking wine,
holding it up,

3758
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:14,610
loving it.
Well the fun thing is the accomplished 

3759
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:14,610
all that.
And he built that studio.

3760
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:14,680
All this while,
like you said,

3761
02:44:14,681 --> 02:44:19,681
doing a full time Gig and drinking like 
William Holden and I'm fucking jerking 

3762
02:44:19,681 --> 02:44:20,670
off and I can't get myself to fucking 
motivated like that.

3763
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:22,520
That's humiliating to me.
Like.

3764
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:25,180
And I've watched anthony build that 
studio and I'm like,

3765
02:44:25,181 --> 02:44:28,000
look at what he's doing.
I can't even rearrange my apartment.

3766
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,370
I fucking just stagnate.
Start and don't finish.

3767
02:44:30,371 --> 02:44:32,290
Start and don't finish.
Start and don't finish it.

3768
02:44:32,291 --> 02:44:33,310
I fucking hate it.
Yeah.

3769
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:36,380
I had always had this idea to do 
something like that when,

3770
02:44:36,460 --> 02:44:38,620
after seeing him do it,
he did his,

3771
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:41,650
his thing was so interesting because at 
the time when he was doing that,

3772
02:44:41,651 --> 02:44:45,010
nobody was doing something live on 
ustream.

3773
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:50,160
Like professionally.
He would like have different 

3774
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:50,160
backgrounds,
you know,

3775
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:53,911
he could have a background that was like
the city because the green screen it 

3776
02:44:53,911 --> 02:44:54,400
gets switched the background and turn 
into whatever the fuck he wanted,

3777
02:44:54,401 --> 02:44:56,560
which was so bad ass.
It's a great idea.

3778
02:44:56,561 --> 02:45:01,561
And he know when he does it,
when he eventually just turns it on and 

3779
02:45:01,561 --> 02:45:03,991
pots up the mix anytime he wants,
he just goes downstairs and hits the 

3780
02:45:03,991 --> 02:45:04,180
switch and boom,
you know,

3781
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:05,220
and then,
uh,

3782
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:10,290
Brian set up the place of the ice house 
and that's like the natural progression 

3783
02:45:10,290 --> 02:45:10,290
of setting this place up.

3784
02:45:10,290 --> 02:45:12,310
I need a technical partnership with 
somebody.

3785
02:45:12,311 --> 02:45:16,120
I need somebody in New York who can 
technically box idea.

3786
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:17,080
Yeah,
obviously.

3787
02:45:17,081 --> 02:45:22,081
But then Richard intellectually just 
take it and make it so much better as 

3788
02:45:22,081 --> 02:45:24,250
well as intellectual dominated.
What can't serious.

3789
02:45:24,251 --> 02:45:26,140
Don't they have sound guys?
I don't mean with that.

3790
02:45:26,141 --> 02:45:27,330
I mean,
with somebody's independence,

3791
02:45:27,331 --> 02:45:28,200
like if I want to do,
because I want it,

3792
02:45:28,210 --> 02:45:29,950
I told you I want to talk show.
Like I really,

3793
02:45:29,951 --> 02:45:31,690
I love interviewing people,
I love it.

3794
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:33,820
And uh,
I want to do that.

3795
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:35,570
Well that's what a podcast is.
Yeah.

3796
02:45:35,630 --> 02:45:40,630
But I'll be able to do it like on TV as 
far as I want to do it on and let it 

3797
02:45:40,630 --> 02:45:40,630
out.
I couldn't help it.

3798
02:45:40,630 --> 02:45:42,670
It was beginning to cause me great pain.
It was like a secret.

3799
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:50,190
So I would like to do that.
So you want to do it on like fx or 

3800
02:45:50,190 --> 02:45:50,190
something like that,
like come out.

3801
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:55,320
They have him five nights a week now 
they would have known what I mean like 

3802
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:57,250
that kind of fun.
I think it's a fun thing to do and uh,

3803
02:45:57,650 --> 02:45:59,050
I would like to do it.
Yeah,

3804
02:45:59,051 --> 02:46:04,051
that does seem like a fun thing to do 
and you would have access to a lot of 

3805
02:46:04,051 --> 02:46:04,270
really fascinating people by doing 
something like that.

3806
02:46:04,570 --> 02:46:05,670
So yeah,
and again,

3807
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:08,110
I like to talk to people and interview 
them and you know,

3808
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:10,760
it's not a,
it's fun to do.

3809
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:16,110
It's really fun to.
I was talking to Ben Kingsley on time 

3810
02:46:16,110 --> 02:46:16,110
and I'm like,
well how great is this?

3811
02:46:16,110 --> 02:46:20,831
He has to answer my questions.
If I bumped into him in a fucking Oscar 

3812
02:46:20,831 --> 02:46:20,831
party,
he'd spit on me,

3813
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:22,210
but here he is sitting next to me.

3814
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:23,100
Oh yes,
yes.

3815
02:46:23,130 --> 02:46:24,770
Answering because he doesn't want to 
look at it.

3816
02:46:24,771 --> 02:46:26,490
It's like that's the cool part about it.
Yeah,

3817
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:31,600
and especially if they come in 
specifically to sit down with you for x 

3818
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:32,260
amount of time,
you know,

3819
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:37,480
you could really dig into somebody if 
you're talking to them for an hour or 

3820
02:46:37,480 --> 02:46:37,650
two hours or whatever it would be.
Yeah.

3821
02:46:37,651 --> 02:46:38,390
That's the,
I think,

3822
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:43,420
you know,
it'd be great if you did like a Bob 

3823
02:46:43,420 --> 02:46:45,640
Costas type thing.
There are Bob Costas had later with Bob 

3824
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:45,640
Costas.
Oh yeah.

3825
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:49,660
And he just was just real simple.
Is that Kim at a desk with a person or 

3826
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:50,600
sit down with them for a full hour?
No,

3827
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:55,750
I don't know.
That could hold the audience for an 

3828
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,750
hour.
I want to do sketches to that.

3829
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,970
I appreciate like I have some things I 
wanted to do.

3830
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,800
So you want to essentially host the 
tonight show type situation,

3831
02:46:58,850 --> 02:47:01,160
but nothing that quite that structured 
or that,

3832
02:47:01,610 --> 02:47:02,150
you know what I mean?

3833
02:47:02,150 --> 02:47:07,150
It would be.
It would have to have a much different 

3834
02:47:07,150 --> 02:47:08,861
feeling than that.
But would you want to do it like 

3835
02:47:08,861 --> 02:47:08,861
showtime style uncensored?
Oh yeah.

3836
02:47:08,861 --> 02:47:09,890
So that's what you'd want to do?
Yeah.

3837
02:47:10,490 --> 02:47:11,800
Just say whatever I launched.
Yeah,

3838
02:47:11,810 --> 02:47:14,270
you got to do it on showtime or hbo 
either.

3839
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:19,290
We're a bunch of other cable channels 
where there are a couple of language 

3840
02:47:19,290 --> 02:47:19,650
issues,
but not many millions channels.

3841
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:24,670
Now they're starting to open up and a 
lot of people don't realize the FCC 

3842
02:47:24,670 --> 02:47:26,480
doesn't control cable.
They only control broadcast television,

3843
02:47:26,840 --> 02:47:28,280
NBC,
CBS,

3844
02:47:28,330 --> 02:47:29,300
that,
that kind of shit.

3845
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:34,630
When you get to cable,
they essentially self-impose 

3846
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:34,630
advertisers.
Yeah.

3847
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:34,670
Yeah.
Some of them.

3848
02:47:34,671 --> 02:47:39,671
That's why like the shield was able to 
say shit and asshole and everybody was 

3849
02:47:39,671 --> 02:47:40,340
like,
what the hell didn't go fuck.

3850
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:42,470
They don't go as far as fuck,
but they can.

3851
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,820
Did you like the shield?

3852
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:45,390
Spike did.
I never saw this shield.

3853
02:47:45,391 --> 02:47:46,490
I've heard it's great.
Loved it.

3854
02:47:46,491 --> 02:47:51,491
I'm a wire fanatic and then people tell 
me you'll like this if you ever see the 

3855
02:47:51,491 --> 02:47:54,341
wire.
I only watched a couple episodes of the 

3856
02:47:54,341 --> 02:47:54,341
wire.
I need to get back to a.

3857
02:47:54,341 --> 02:47:54,360
people always tell me that it's the 
greatest show ever.

3858
02:47:54,361 --> 02:47:56,950
It's my favorite show ever.
Fucking masterpiece.

3859
02:47:57,030 --> 02:48:01,610
I think game of thrones is my favorite 
game of thrones to the wires better.

3860
02:48:02,390 --> 02:48:03,260
I thought so.
Yeah.

3861
02:48:03,330 --> 02:48:05,640
It was realistic about drug dealing and 
uh,

3862
02:48:06,110 --> 02:48:06,810
I've,
I just,

3863
02:48:06,820 --> 02:48:08,760
I loved it and I love the characters 
out.

3864
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:10,460
Check it out,
Jimmy.

3865
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:12,470
And you're special.
When does it come out?

3866
02:48:12,770 --> 02:48:16,010
August 23rd.
I thank you on epics and epics.

3867
02:48:16,011 --> 02:48:17,510
Hd Dot com.
You can get.

3868
02:48:17,511 --> 02:48:22,511
Just sign up for a trial if you want to 
watch it online if your cable provider 

3869
02:48:22,511 --> 02:48:26,111
doesn't hold record that I shot it in a,
it looks like the Tabernacle.

3870
02:48:26,550 --> 02:48:28,040
And uh oh,
that's in,

3871
02:48:28,910 --> 02:48:30,190
that's in a.
no,

3872
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:32,120
it's in Somerville.
Mass.

3873
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:33,230
Somerville.
Couple weekS before the bombing.

3874
02:48:33,231 --> 02:48:35,510
I wish it was after the bombing because 
I would've addressed it,

3875
02:48:35,810 --> 02:48:40,810
which were really.
Of course I would have mocked the 

3876
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:40,810
bombers.
Yeah,

3877
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:40,850
it was talking about those fuCking.
Yeah,

3878
02:48:40,851 --> 02:48:42,950
I was talking about kicking their mother
and the content.

3879
02:48:42,951 --> 02:48:43,820
Fuck them.
Yeah,

3880
02:48:43,821 --> 02:48:44,900
it was bashing them.
Yeah.

3881
02:48:45,050 --> 02:48:46,470
I would love to.
The mother and the current.

3882
02:48:46,540 --> 02:48:46,960
Yeah,
I,

3883
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:48,380
yeah.
Her womb is a terra camp like.

3884
02:48:48,381 --> 02:48:53,381
Yeah,
I had a whole bunch of fun with that 

3885
02:48:53,381 --> 02:48:53,470
fucking brothers.
So it's on epix.

3886

When's the date again?
August 23rd and it requires a lot and if

3887
02:48:57,501 --> 02:49:00,320

02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:03,020
A beautiful and I'm happy with it.
So that's epix.com

Epics hd.com.

3890

And jim norton on twitter.
Jim norton,

3891
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:14,440
so following me,
dirty fox and jim norton dotcom is 

3892
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:14,970
finally going up.
It's been too long on this motherfucker,

3893
02:49:14,971 --> 02:49:16,410
man.
You really fun guy.

3894
02:49:16,411 --> 02:49:19,170
I really enjoy talking to you and like I
said,

3895
02:49:19,171 --> 02:49:20,990
I really appreciate your,
your,

3896
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:26,600
your intelligent take on that debate 
about jokes and rape jokes with lindy 

3897
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:27,460
west.
I thought that was,

3898
02:49:27,790 --> 02:49:30,090
it was really important and I think it 
was really important that you did it.

3899
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:31,890
Thank you.
And I actually liked her too.

3900
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:37,010
I'm not saying that the light.
I genuinely liked her and we talked 

3901
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:37,010
after on the following and she's 
actually really nice.

3902
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:38,580
She's not some psychotic,
you know?

3903
02:49:38,630 --> 02:49:41,040
I think that a lot of our takes on these
things.

3904
02:49:41,130 --> 02:49:46,130
A lot of the interaction that we have,
whether it's a blog to blog or twitter 

3905
02:49:46,130 --> 02:49:46,130
to twitter,
it's,

3906
02:49:46,130 --> 02:49:47,710
it's,
it's such a limited way of communicating

3907
02:49:47,711 --> 02:49:51,210
and a lot of these same people that we 
have disagreements with online.

3908
02:49:51,210 --> 02:49:56,210
If we sat down with them in a rational 
sort of normal setting like this and 

3909
02:49:56,210 --> 02:50:00,171
just talked,
we'd probably see each other's point a 

3910
02:50:00,171 --> 02:50:02,901
lot better and have like some healthy 
discussions about these things as 

3911
02:50:02,901 --> 02:50:07,011
opposed to these like these snipe 
attacks that people like to do in blogs 

3912
02:50:07,011 --> 02:50:09,510
and twitter and go back and forth with 
each other.

3913
02:50:09,511 --> 02:50:14,511
It's,
there's a lot missing in those one way 

3914
02:50:14,511 --> 02:50:17,631
interactions.
When I say something and then you say 

3915
02:50:17,631 --> 02:50:17,631
something and you know when you 
communicate with each other,

3916
02:50:17,631 --> 02:50:22,461
a lot of times you can.
You can get to know someone a lot 

3917
02:50:22,461 --> 02:50:23,940
better.
That's why I liked that conversation was

3918
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:26,610
you could tell there was some real 
discourse going on there,

3919
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:29,610
which regardless of which side you take.
All right,
