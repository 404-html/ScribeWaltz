1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,930
Boom,
and we live just like that.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,090
That's what I like.
That's what I like to man.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,540
We're sitting here.
I'm here with George Perez and right

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,700
when I was coming here,
my neighbor right over here,

5
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:16,760
uh,
just told me there's some black suv

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,870
drive it down the street.
They got battering rams,

7
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:22,050
a black helicopters.
And then Jamie said there's swat crews.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,590
Some shit's going down.
George Perez A.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,530
I tweeted,
let people know you're in the era.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,160
Did you have location services turned
on?

11
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,960
You've got to turn that shit off man.
They find you.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,020
They find you probably will find you.
They probably do.

13
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,020
That's why Aria,
I'm convinced that's why art should

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,020
fear.
Went to a flip phone.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,970
Has Gps on him,
doesn't want them tracking them.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,450
Those mushroom drops and he leaves
everywhere.

17
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:48,780
And
so there's something going on.

18
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,781
So while this podcast is happening,
some shit is going on very close to us

19
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,590
here.
We're in woodland hills.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
So,
uh,

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,080
somewhere in this area,

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,790
somewhere in the eight.
One eight.

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,280
I was nervous coming over here because
of the area.

24
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,331
Really?
Yeah.

25
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,800
I haven't been here since like
[inaudible] 98.

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,630
This is a fucked up area.
Well,

27
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,190
we used to sell speed to people

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,750
received a
visit.

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,800
I remember.
They're like,

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,670
don't turn right to not go that way.
Like you don't want to go back to see

31
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,350
what what you planted.
Oh,

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,450
it's here.
It's here.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,340
Speed is a weird one,
man.

34
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,720
You know they had this statistic the
other day on how many fucking people are

35
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,550
on adderall.
Oh Shit.

36
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,770
She's just.
Speed is just fucking speed.

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,070
There's a statistic that I posted
yesterday that's the most disturbing one

38
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,060
though.
Rhonda.

39
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,110
Patrick.
Dr Rhonda.

40
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:42,111
Patrick put it up.
There's more people on pain pills today.

41
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,290
Then use tobacco foc.
Think about that.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,660
That's how crazy the pain pill business
has gone.

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,470
Think about all the dip,
all the people that chew all the people

44
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,400
that smoke cigars and cigarettes.
All that combined.

45
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,260
There's more people on pain pills

46
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,680
and it's weird because they took
cigarettes away from baseball.

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,240
Remember the use of smoke in the
eighties?

48
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,130
You could smoke in baseball and you
could dip.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,930
I don't remember.
I remember you could dip.

50
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,260
Can't dip anymore.
No,

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,970
no,
no.

52
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,710
I mean,
I don't know about professional.

53
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,830
I know you can't dip in college,
but days to smoke cigarettes in the

54
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,410
games in the dugouts.
Wow.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,840
And I only know because sometimes I stay
up late and watch espn and I'm like,

56
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,300
Oh shit,
you could smoke back then.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,420
So you watch like an old game and
they'll show him still smoking.

58
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,450
It was like espn has classics and it was
like a classics like world series and I

59
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,360
think it was Reggie Jackson smoking in
the dug out.

60
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,590
Look at it,
look at that right there.

61
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,640
He didn't.
There you go.

62
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,220
Joy's a dugout cigarette.
What years that from?

63
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,950
Jamie says 1987.

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,270
Nineteen 87 game.
Yeah.

65
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,020
They used to smoke cigarettes and then
spit.

66
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,770
Always chewing and spitting and now
they're popping pills and getting

67
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,320
concussions.
Well they definitely are popping pills

68
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,850
apparently.
That's another big problem.

69
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,070
Adderall is a big problem with a
baseball.

70
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,200
It helps them focus and concentrate on
hitting the ball better.

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,970
That's just fucking crazy to me.
How they prescribe you speed to get

72
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:11,971
smarter.
It accelerates well for apparently when

73
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,060
who's does that?
Does that mean that's not a thought?

74
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,250
A Dang somebody.
Um,

75
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,540
when you,
uh,

76
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,680
when you have add,
which is real debatable whether or not

77
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,870
that shit's real or how many people
actually,

78
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,580
I mean,
is it just people with energy?

79
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,590
Is it just people were bored,
they don't want to concentrate on

80
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,150
whatever the fuck you want them to
concentrate on.

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,180
I mean,
I don't exactly know what add really is

82
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:38,410
because I think it's severely obese over
prescribed by everyone's measures.

83
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,250
But when you have it,
when you give them speed,

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,470
it helps them calm down somehow or
another.

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,190
I don't get,
it seems it must be like a,

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,740
a focus speed they give or like a
special something they found in there

87
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:56,800
because I'm back in my days and I did
speed.

88
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,090
I couldn't focus on shit.

89
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,610
Maybe that's because you don't have it
though because you don't have add

90
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,450
whatever that means.
But if add doesn't exist and maybe it's

91
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,700
just something that makes everybody
focus.

92
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,970
Well I think add most likely is just
there's a bunch of behaviors.

93
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,810
There's a bunch of different ways people
behave and there's a bunch of ways their

94
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:24,811
mind works and some people they like to
stay calm and focus on one thing and be

95
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,870
like peace and quiet and other people
are scattered as fuck and they're

96
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:32,020
thinking about a million different
things and they can't concentrate speed

97
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,780
apparently for those people helps them
concentrate.

98
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,780
But the question is like,
if someone is like,

99
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:40,600
I had a next door neighbor and uh,
this next door neighbor,

100
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:45,220
his kid was just a regular fucking kid
and they put the kid on Prozac.

101
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,380
It was really weird,
man.

102
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:47,971
They were like,
ah,

103
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:49,060
you can't concentrate.

104
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,620
He's just,
he's all over the place.

105
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,251
So we,
you know,

106
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,740
we put them on and I,
I couldn't even talk to the dude.

107
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,970
I was just like,
this is crazy.

108
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,250
You're medicating a.
He was like an eight or nine year old

109
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,990
kid.
He's just a fucking kid.

110
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,500
Most kids when they go to school,
they don't want to pay attention to

111
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,120
whatever the fuck the teacher's talking
about.

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,980
No,
I,

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,970
I woulda,
I woulda got prescribed.

114
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:10,900
Or was that district called diagnosed?
I got diagnosed as kindergarten.

115
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,660
Yeah,
I think I would have to for sure if I

116
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,000
had that guy for a dad,
he definitely would have put me on some

117
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:18,460
medication.
That's weird.

118
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,440
I remember the first time I heard of
add,

119
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,150
like I thought it was a gang and I was
like,

120
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,890
can we get along with those foods?

121
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,180
They're like,
Nah,

122
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,650
foe,
it's a focusing shit.

123
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,290
And I was just like,
Oh,

124
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,100
what the hell?
A focusing shit.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
So the kind of speed that you would sell
these people out here,

126
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,130
like what kind of speed was at back
then?

127
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,670
They used to be called crank,
you remember?

128
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,390
Do remember crying?
What is that?

129
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,940
I don't know.
I think crank is just like the best part

130
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,650
of the strict nine because it's made out
of.

131
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,200
Am I right?
The best part of.

132
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,530
Yeah.
And we used to sell the peanut butter

133
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:54,910
one.
It was a peanut butter one.

134
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,890
It was,
it was weird because like back in those

135
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,190
days,
speed had a taste that was just awful.

136
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,520
It was like rotten.
A cactus cooler.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,970
That's what it tasted like.
Like a rotten cactus cooler.

138
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,290
You ever left?
The cactus cooler out.

139
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,110
That's it.
Oh yeah.

140
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,860
And so it's,
it was made with a peanut butter taste.

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,030
That was weird.
Yeah.

142
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,190
I mean I don't remember who we were
getting it from.

143
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,710
I just remember the guy going
[inaudible] we used to hit it out of a

144
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,570
bong so it was due.
We were crazy.

145
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,420
And I'd be like,
fuck this shit.

146
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:33,320
Tastes like peanut butter.
So yeah,

147
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,780
I started focusing on peanut butter
sandwiches.

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,990
You focused.
That's so bizarre.

149
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,940
So when,
when you would do that back then,

150
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,380
um,
you would have to like how,

151
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:46,700
how do you get into the speed business?
Like you'd have to find somebody who's

152
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:47,810
cooking.
Yeah,

153
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,480
I mean yeah,
it was weird because a,

154
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,561
I'm like,
what?

155
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:55,550
Twenty years old.
I just left my lady for being a tweaker,

156
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,550
like a crazy one and then it just got me
involved and be like,

157
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,211
no,
fuck this.

158
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,210
I need to make money.
I need to make money and my buddies go

159
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:03,950
ahead.
So I was to say,

160
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,460
so she was a crazy tweaker.
She wasn't like hard core,

161
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,520
like still to this day,
still alive.

162
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:13,340
Still do.
She has seven kids from six guys.

163
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
Oh good.
Ken.

164
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,720
She's that kind of girl.
That's just pretty where a guy will be

165
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:20,240
like,
I'll pay for whatever you want and she's

166
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,590
with it.
Wow.

167
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,170
I'm just happy.
I was the first one and I got out.

168
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,580
Man,
that's a weird one.

169
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,080
Right.
But people that are on speed,

170
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,630
I hung out with a dude recently that was
on speed.

171
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,300
He didn't want him and he was on speed,
but you could tell because he would do

172
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,090
things like he was saying that we've
talked to him.

173
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,970
He turned like real quick,
kind of collect themselves and turn real

174
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,730
quick and like why we were meeting.
A couple of my buddies were like,

175
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:47,660
why is he moving so fast?
And then trying to calm himself down and

176
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:49,880
like he,
he was driving us and when he was

177
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,710
driving he would make like these quick
turns.

178
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm incorrect trying to calm himself.
Like this guy's on fucking speed,

179
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,870
man.
Going on as if he made a move and then

180
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,520
he looked at shoe to be like,
fuck this.

181
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,091
You know,
I'm on it.

182
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:02,924
Okay.

183
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,640
I mean,
I wouldn't look at the way he was

184
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,500
turning it was like he heard a loud
noise,

185
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,440
like a for everything he did.
All your senses are up,

186
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,030
senses are up,
you're alert to anything and everything.

187
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,440
It's up.
I mean,

188
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,720
Hitler gave it to his troops,
right?

189
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

190
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,870
They say he invented it.
I don't know if that's true.

191
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,570
Um,
I think it was invented during that

192
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,830
time.
I don't think it was Hitler.

193
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,620
Hitler was in the lab.
I've got it.

194
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,760
That's why as much,
that's just so little results.

195
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,720
I've got to keep this one
clean.

196
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,990
No,
I think they invented it during that

197
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,990
era.
And uh,

198
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,040
I know they gave it to the kamikaze is
too.

199
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,970
That's how they got the kamikaze is to
fly those planes into battle ships.

200
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,500
They would just jacked up on math.
That's fucking crazy.

201
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,300
Yeah.
A little math speed,

202
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,640
you know,
all that stuff is just,

203
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,310
just those accelerants,
any of those things that just they fuck

204
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,144
with your judgment.

205
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,520
I remember there was this,
I believe it was Gq.

206
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,810
I was reading this article about this
guy who was a lawyer and he was this

207
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,470
real successful lawyer and he got
involved somehow or another with a

208
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:15,420
client that was a meth dealer and so
then all of a sudden he starts getting

209
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,150
into the math business.
He just realized there's a lot of

210
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:19,590
fucking money in this.
Yes,

211
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,830
I guess he started doing meth and then
he started selling math and then one of

212
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:27,780
the things they say is when you do a lot
of Meth,

213
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,630
you start making like really poor
judgement calls.

214
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,021
You're like,
oh,

215
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,100
this is fine.
This is fine.

216
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:35,580
This is going to work.
So he started a stockpile and meth in

217
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:39,360
his fucking basement,
like just stank and like as he opened

218
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,500
the door to his basement,
like,

219
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,670
what the fuck is down?

220
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,600
They're just big paint buckets filled
with math everywhere and that that can

221
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,360
burn your body.
It'll like jack you up.

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,200
If you put it on your skin,
it will burn through it within an hour.

223
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,100
Really?
Yeah.

224
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,220
That's why those guys have those day
touch it when they cut it up and then

225
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,370
they touch their face and that's how
they get those holes in their face.

226
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,860
I thought they started itching,
like they would start scratching

227
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,730
themselves right now it's the touch and
then the touch becomes the crater of the

228
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,270
pimple.
Then they start picking up that.

229
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,580
I had a buddy he'd walk around with like
bandaids everywhere.

230
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,350
Oh Man.
I was like,

231
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:14,730
fuck dude,
you need to chill.

232
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,120
So this girl was all hopped up on
Craig's mom,

233
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,060
the girl when you were 20.
Yup.

234
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,610
And then,
but back then I belong to a gang and

235
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,400
like every gang has their hustle.
Some gangs sell whack,

236
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,430
some gangs sells weed,
some gangs sell guns.

237
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,650
Ars was speed.
That was our hustle.

238
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,620
Somebody was fucking somebody that could
have got it.

239
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:39,600
And we got it.
Wow.

240
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,920
Yeah,
it was,

241
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,830
it was weird because this is like 1998.
So we're,

242
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,970
I remember we drove like a.
You remember when the Thunderbird,

243
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,630
the Ford car was cool.
Yeah,

244
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:49,500
the new one.
Right?

245
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,600
But it was in 1998.
Yeah.

246
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,670
I remember we had one,
we were just like,

247
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,560
yeah,
those were dope itches from the eight

248
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:59,370
one eight
and yeah,

249
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:02,560
it was fucking fun.
You know what's weird about speed is?

250
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,840
Well,
when I was in prison,

251
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,070
you could tell that these people are
still tweakers because you know how you

252
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:11,280
light a lighter,
your thumb goes down and then when you

253
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:13,590
hit the pipe you spin your finger in
this way,

254
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,350
so that's how you're hitting a speakpipe
because you're spinning it.

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,010
And I used to play handball with this
guy and he would do it every fucking

256
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,740
time.
He would just spin this hand and like,

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,660
like the lighter,
oh,

258
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,480
like make the movements and his fingers
while was playing hamlet.

259
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,810
Hey Dog,
you do like we call it bomb.

260
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:28,561
Hey,
you do bomb.

261
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,730
He's like,
well you got some.

262
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,200
I've been done two years.
I was like,

263
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,530
we used to make fun of him.
Like,

264
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,351
Hey,
don't hit the pipe,

265
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:39,930
serve the ball.
So for two years later he's still making

266
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,480
those motions.
It's your body craves it.

267
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,180
You can see it in people.
Their body is dislike.

268
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,240
I need that motion.
You'll notice when you see people doing

269
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,980
the spinning with the lighter,
they're tweakers.

270
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,640
Wow.
That's something I discovered.

271
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,130
You noticed it.
Yeah.

272
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,650
Recognition.
Thank you.

273
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,970
Yeah.
Well,

274
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,900
it's amazing that two years out he was
still wanting to know in prison.

275
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,820
Two years out of it.
Yeah.

276
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,190
Oh,
feening it.

277
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,560
Wow.
Feening couldn't wait.

278
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,870
Oh,
so that's a guy that just can't get it.

279
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,180
It's not like he's gotten sober.
He just can't get it.

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah.
There's a lot of those guys.

281
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,320
I mean like there's a lot of people that
when they go to prison,

282
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,190
they're not druggies because to be a
druggie and prison is to be looked

283
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,820
frowned upon.
So you're a man in there and when you're

284
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:25,900
in there you're like,
fuck that.

285
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm going to work out,
I'm going to be strong.

286
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,170
And then when you get out it's
temptation.

287
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,060
You're good looking,
you're healthy again.

288
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,450
You're getting it.
That's the weird part of prison.

289
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,140
So most of the guys.
So when,

290
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,170
when a guy's a junkie and he goes into
prison,

291
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:43,150
did they try to clean up or they try to
get it while you have to clean up?

292
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,850
Because if you don't clean up,
they're going to call you a Jay cat.

293
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,690
A Jay cat is like equivalent of a bomb,
but in prison,

294
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:52,440
if you're a Jay cat,
you're going to get picked on.

295
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,870
People are going to laugh at you.
You don't want to like,

296
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,630
you want to be clean and healthy.
Really?

297
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,430
Yes.
That's interesting because that's

298
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,470
contrary to what a lot of people would
think about prison.

299
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,461
They would think,
you know,

300
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,860
you go to prison,
you gave up hope and now you just let

301
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:09,610
yourself go.
And I mean that's what you think because

302
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:11,020
you're out there,
but when you're in there,

303
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:14,620
you notice people look at you and you
want people to like ice look at falls on

304
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,480
drugs and be like,
this fucking dude.

305
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,680
All right.
Yeah.

306
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,570
Here's the soap.
I know you don't got money because

307
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,460
you're wasting it on everything.
Here's a soup.

308
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,220
I wanted to be that guy that was just,
Oh,

309
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,180
look at,
you know,

310
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,740
homies clean.
He takes care of himself.

311
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:31,660
He's a man of his word and that's what
people want is when you get out,

312
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,480
it's there.
It's not like one of the bigger

313
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,270
misconceptions about prison,
like when you talk to people that

314
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:38,950
haven't been to prison that don't know
anything about prison,

315
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,750
what do you think?
Like the big misconceptions.

316
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,040
That big misconception is a.
do you get fucked in the ass?

317
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,420
You get raised the big one,
right?

318
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,130
Yeah.
And I'm like that shit is not even

319
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,500
allowed.
Like you'll get killed for that shit

320
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,140
because everyone's watching gangland and
they're watching us at lockup.

321
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,460
MSNBC.
Yeah.

322
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,080
And those are only protective custody of
yards.

323
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,140
They're never interviewing a real prison
yard where the shit's rules are rules.

324
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,180
That's it.
You don't make them,

325
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,040
you don't break them,
you follow them.

326
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,870
So like when you see that you ever
watched that thing was locked up the

327
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,990
they had that dude was the booty bandit.
See that one?

328
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,760
And I was like,
I was watching that.

329
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:21,010
I was like,
how much did that guy is like just

330
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,640
making shit up.
Yeah,

331
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,750
like the stories they used to make up.
This guy used to tell me,

332
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,600
hey dog,
back in the days there was this black

333
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:33,340
guy in Corcoran and if you fucked up the
guards would throw you in his cell.

334
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,840
And they used to call him purple passion
and they said he used to rip falls

335
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,940
apart.
And I was like,

336
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,250
what Gfe Fuck.
And my head,

337
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,084
I was like,
I will,

338
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
I'll bite him,
I'll do whatever.

339
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,180
No,
you're at.

340
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,070
No.
Yeah.

341
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,750
And that's.
And the other thing is,

342
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:52,070
is um,
that we work all

343
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,610
day and we break rocks and shit.
Yes.

344
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,760
No,
like,

345
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,780
let me give you the same in your Sally's
and uh,

346
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,600
usually have a job.
That job gives you 13 to thirty eight

347
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,090
cents an hour.
I was a butcher so I had the highest

348
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,360
paying job.
You would,

349
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,110
you would have been a butcher too.
So we would get up at 4:00,

350
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,200
take a shower,
clean our room,

351
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,480
clean ourselves,
we'd go to work,

352
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,680
come back,
then eat with our people quarter yard,

353
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,340
fuck around for a little bit,
trying to find a cigarette or something.

354
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,110
Go back to yard and then boom,
come back to the cell.

355
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:31,700
And like,
that's it,

356
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,500
it's like,
it's like a program,

357
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,700
another life.
There's,

358
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,850
I took college courses in there.
Uh,

359
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,910
I was a janitor.
I was,

360
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,520
it's fucking crazy.
I can just sit back and be like,

361
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,290
fuck man.
Sometimes I miss it.

362
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,860
I'm just saying I wish I was on the yard
working out with these guys and playing

363
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,100
basketball because the camaraderie of
like,

364
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,630
oh,
it was just awesome.

365
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,390
That's so crazy.
So it was fun sometimes.

366
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,030
Fuck yeah,
fuck yeah,

367
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,960
it was fun until like 12:00 hit or 9:00
hit.

368
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,591
And I'm like,
fuck,

369
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,690
I want to go do a spot.
Give me the fuck Outta here.

370
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,130
Right.
And then I'm just like,

371
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,900
I can't go home.
I can't go home.

372
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,010
I can't go home.

373
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,450
And then my last prison,
there was a park like 50 yards away from

374
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,780
us.
And you're just looking out the window.

375
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,451
Like,
fuck,

376
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,650
I want to go play the catch.
Yeah.

377
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,610
Yeah.
So there was moments.

378
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:26,240
It was fun.
But ultimately the big thing is the lack

379
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,330
of freedom.
You can,

380
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,170
you can have fun while you're there,
but you can't choose what you can do.

381
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

382
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,900
Lack of freedom and then you know,
prison cops are completely different

383
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,380
from cops on the street.
They're called correction officers and

384
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:42,050
in there there's a respect like when
they see you,

385
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:42,741
hey,
good morning,

386
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:46,460
how you doing today?
Everybody gets a good morning and if you

387
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,800
know,
if you're fucking up his program to make

388
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,380
them go out of his way,
it's your fault.

389
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,340
But if he wants to be tested then you
got to do what you gotta do.

390
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,680
If he wants to be tested.
Like how,

391
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,400
like,
you know,

392
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,050
there's these cops that go in there and
they,

393
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,420
they've had a problem.
You know,

394
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,300
I,
I could see why racism exist in prison

395
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,690
because maybe there's this cop that came
from Solidad and now he's going to

396
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,850
another prison.
And when he held,

397
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:15,130
the reason you left solid dad is because
all the Mexicans jumped his ass.

398
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,550
So he's going to have a little like,
hmm.

399
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,160
All right motherfuckers,
you got me over there?

400
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Yeah,
it's weird.

401
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,810
They transfer them like that and then
like if you don't jump in,

402
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,320
I've seen cops talk shit on other cops.
Like all fuck that fool.

403
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:30,910
There's a ride.
He didn't do shit.

404
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh really?
So it looks a lot like prisoners in some

405
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:34,870
way.
Yeah,

406
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,350
they are too,
because they're there 18 hours a day or

407
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,690
12.
They mean they just get to go home.

408
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,520
They do that long as shift.
Yeah,

409
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,870
it's a 12 hour shift.
Why?

410
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:48,370
They do such a long shift.
That's their union and they get a lot of

411
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,980
hours,
but they only work four days

412
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,080
a week.
Okay.

413
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,360
That's probably better.
I'd probably rather work 12 hours a day,

414
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:58,680
four days a week than eight hours a day
and five day and Kevin a whole extra day

415
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:02,100
to do whatever the fuck you want to do
because you feel like your day's kind of

416
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,690
wrecked anyway when you work eight
hours.

417
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,810
It's hard to get anything in.
I used to be a construction worker

418
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,930
before this and I hated that shit.
Before comedy,

419
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,610
I did construction when I was a kid.
My my stepfather was an architect,

420
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:19,440
so I got a lot of jobs on USS Cole
construction sites and I just remember

421
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,350
being exhausted.
That was the thing that I remember most.

422
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,070
Was it like residential housing tracks?
Most of it was residential,

423
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,870
but occasionally we would do like we did
a knights of Columbus Hall,

424
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:30,780
but that was,
I was working with my friend Jimmy and

425
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:31,500
his,
uh,

426
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,280
his boss.

427
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,400
It was a different construction company,
but that was the hardest job I've ever

428
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,250
had in my life because all I did the
whole summer was a.

429
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,080
I only,
I only survived for a couple of weeks.

430
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,160
I quit.
I was like,

431
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,370
I can't do this anymore.
I was carrying cement bags and pressure,

432
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,790
treated lumber all day.
I was 19 that I remember.

433
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,490
I remember thinking that was so
motivating because I was thinking like,

434
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,710
this is not gonna work.
Like I can't do this for my life.

435
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,750
I had no,
I was 19.

436
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,700
You're at the peak of your energy,
you know,

437
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,070
and I was.
And it was in the summer so it was hot,

438
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,360
you know,
as Boston.

439
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:05,460
So it was muggy bald.
No,

440
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,140
he didn't have a shaved head or no,
no,

441
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,340
not back then.
Okay.

442
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,440
Because the sun beats you're out.
Yeah.

443
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,020
Yeah.
Not a beautiful head of hair back then.

444
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,060
How's was lovely.
But I'm all day carrying bags of cement

445
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,460
and pressure treated lumber,
which is heavy as fuck.

446
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,930
So.
And then you'd get these splinters in

447
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:23,370
your hand.
They get all infected because the

448
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,280
pressure treated lumber has some sort of
chemicals in it.

449
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,170
Yeah.
It has like a something.

450
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,290
So the board doesn't bend because the
board bends with the sun.

451
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,940
Yeah.
It was brutal.

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,390
But I remember thinking this is a good
lesson because now because I used to

453
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,130
think God just get a good job,
work all day.

454
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,530
Then after work I'll do whatever the
fuck I want to do.

455
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,850
But I remember thinking,
nope,

456
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,770
that's not going to work.
You're not going to have any fucking

457
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:45,480
energy.
You're not gonna have any energy.

458
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,910
Yeah.
I used to be a cement finisher.

459
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,400
That was some shit we used to do curb
and gutter,

460
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,900
but we do it out of a machine.

461
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,210
You've ever seen those current machines?
Yeah,

462
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:58,500
it was a good Maaco remember at $1,500
we used to poor 40 fucking trucks a day.

463
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,660
Whoa.
And I used to like,

464
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,420
it was weird,
like my boss would look at me like if I

465
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:05,930
was like a Mexican that he didn't know I
was a citizen,

466
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:06,451
so I'd be like,
hey,

467
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,390
dog were pouring 40 trucks and they were
pouring 20,

468
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:13,380
why are they making as much money as us?
And He'd be like,

469
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,360
let's go back over there and get out of
here.

470
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,970
And I'd be like,
Hey,

471
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,490
I'm a fucking citizen dog.
My name starts with a g,

472
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,560
like come on.
We were union.

473
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,640
So it was,
yeah,

474
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,330
I got out of it.
Yeah.

475
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:28,920
That's the thing about California in
general that a lot of people don't

476
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:33,270
realize the massive amount of illegal
aliens.

477
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,510
It's straight up laugh when they,
when they say,

478
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,850
well,
there's 18 million people in the greater

479
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,920
Los Angeles area.
I'm like,

480
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,660
plus Mexicans.
Yeah.

481
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:44,340
Try to try to do the calculation.
You don't know what that number is.

482
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,080
Nobody knows.
It's a total guess.

483
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,490
That would be like the guests have
guesses.

484
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,630
Yeah.
How the fuck did they know?

485
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,880
That should be the lottery.
If you can guess how many illegal

486
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,940
immigrants are in,
you win the lottery.

487
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,580
Yeah,
you get a dollar for everyone.

488
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,200
It'll be insane.
Yeah.

489
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:04,060
This is probably,
I don't know,

490
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I mean I would,
I would just guess it would be millions,

491
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,170
right?
Has to be this way more here and that's

492
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,240
just Mexicans or you're missing
Russians,

493
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,920
El Salvadorians,
Canadians,

494
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,370
Canadian lot of illegal Canadians
because they blend right the fuck in

495
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,120
until they say about you have no idea.
And they're like a boat and they're

496
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,963
like,
what?

497
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,760
We got one,
we found them.

498
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,020
How long were you in prison for?
I did three years,

499
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,970
uh,
two years.

500
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,800
Eleven months.
So they just shade three.

501
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,260
Tell me the story about it because you
were telling me that the comedy store,

502
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,430
it's kind of a fucked up story.

503
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,271
Yeah.
So,

504
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:37,931
uh,
you know,

505
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,070
before I was comedian,
I was a gangster and a deconstruction

506
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,010
and then uh,
I used to play sports so I was real good

507
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,770
in basketball and I was playing at the
park and you know,

508
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,140
basketball is a sport that's very
physical,

509
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,300
you know,
when you back someone in at the park,

510
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:55,660
there's no ref.
So it's full of men and trying to muscle

511
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,291
me.
So I'm like,

512
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,480
all right,
I go around them and I still a ball and

513
00:21:58,481 --> 00:21:59,580
it's all foul.
Alright,

514
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,430
here you go,
take it.

515
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,150
So now me and him get physical and the
elbows me and I had to check myself like

516
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,290
hold up like you're in mice.
This is how I used to think back.

517
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,760
Then Joe,
I'm like,

518
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:16,330
you're in my city.
I got jumped into my gang at this park,

519
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,920
how am I going to let you elbow me?

520
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,880
So I socked him and we went at it and I
beat his ass bad.

521
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,070
Like you ever fight someone and like
they don't stop.

522
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,430
You know what I mean?
Like I mean I'm sorry,

523
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,470
like a lot of people look at me,
they're like,

524
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:36,730
no,
I've never had that problem.

525
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,130
I like this guy wanted to kick my ass
but I like,

526
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,460
I didn't want to hurt him so I just
dropped them and I throw them to the

527
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,170
floor.
Need a mug him.

528
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,820
Yeah man,
there's a,

529
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:51,970
there's some people that won't fucking
quit John if you're beating her ass.

530
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,010
Yeah.
So those people are dangerous.

531
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,420
Fuck yeah.
So I,

532
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,350
this is the funny part is I left him,
like I beat his ass and ran to my car.

533
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,100
I was like,
I need to go so I could

534
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,120
get to my car and I take off.
All right,

535
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:07,954
cool.

536
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,590
I see.
I,

537
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,590
I become a comedian maybe like a year
and a half later I become a comic

538
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,940
trying,
you know what I mean?

539
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:16,270
Like,
you know,

540
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,460
everyone says,
well I'm a comic.

541
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,370
I've gone up four or five times.
Like,

542
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,050
you know,
I'm trying to be a comic and a,

543
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,330
I get the,
I get a good break.

544
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,890
Jeff Garcia,
good guy,

545
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:27,790
man picked me up.
He goes,

546
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,780
hey,
you're my new opener.

547
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,370
Like fuck.
All right.

548
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,800
So I was like four months in the comedy
and I'm doing the Improv.

549
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,560
Not even knowing.
I'm just like talking to the crowd and

550
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:39,720
what's going on.
Like I'm probably like the best salesman

551
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
making people laugh.
That's all I'm doing now.

552
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,570
I don't even know jokes yet.
I'm trying them.

553
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,890
Then I get jokes and then uh,
I'm good at roasting and MTV,

554
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:53,570
your Mama comes out and I get picked up
for that show and I win my first

555
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:58,070
episode.
Fucking guy that I beat up sees me on TV

556
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,320
and he's like,
oh,

557
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:03,110
she had cash money.
This whole God's money.

558
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,220
So this is the crazy part is a lot of
people say,

559
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,350
oh,
there's a statute of limitations and all

560
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,600
that.
Since it's a John Doe crime,

561
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,270
it doesn't have it.
If you don't know who beats you up,

562
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,150
you don't have a limited restrictions.
So until they find out who beat you up,

563
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:23,480
then the statute of limitations case in,
I don't even know.

564
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,490
That's how horrible my lawyer was.

565
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,540
Wow.
That seems crazy.

566
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,210
So if you beat somebody up 50 years ago
and they just found out your name,

567
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,430
they could,
they could still sue you or take you to

568
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,264
jail.
I don't.

569
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,620
Yeah,
I mean I think it's,

570
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,570
I don't know,
probably like five.

571
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,520
So what year is this when this is all
going on?

572
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,930
Two thousand four.
2,000?

573
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,480
No,
this is 2000.

574
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:49,160
Two,
2003 because I fought it for two years

575
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,730
because my brother bailed me out.
I was still filming an MTV.

576
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,160
Wow.
So my brother bells me out.

577
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,031
He's like,
all right,

578
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,040
check the song,
got me a lawyer and all the crap.

579
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,770
Ah,
Shit.

580
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,980
I remember just going to court who?
Just that whole like,

581
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:06,890
what the hell is going on?
I stopped.

582
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,820
I'm not you.
They offered me eight years.

583
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,290
They're like,
look at it,

584
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,020
take eight years because he has a great
bodily injury.

585
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,560
This guy that I beat up,
he has a metal plate and he's all fucked

586
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,480
up and they're like,
take eight years.

587
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,130
And I was like a metal plate in his
cheek.

588
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,083
Yeah,
right here.

589
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,740
Orbital fracture.
Yeah.

590
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,410
Oh Shit.
I see a lot of those.

591
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,980
Oh,
okay.

592
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,570
Yeah,
I mean I caught them good.

593
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,110
Like I think I caught them like just,
you know,

594
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,660
all this stuff around the eyes breaks
pretty easy.

595
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,400
All this stuff.
Okay.

596
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,060
Orbital stuff.
It's super common in mma especially.

597
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,120
It was weird because they were trying to
say I used a weapon.

598
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,860
They're like,
there's no way you could have done that.

599
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:46,450
And I was like,
oh,

600
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,300
he's crazy.
Yeah.

601
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,500
I was like,
I didn't use a weapon.

602
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,160
So I bail out.
I'm doing a comic.

603
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,270
Being a dad,
I think I'm going to win this case.

604
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,800
That's the funny part.
Because I was like,

605
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:58,840
dude,
nobody was there.

606
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,790
Nobody seen me.
But then I have to admit that you beat

607
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:02,630
him up.
No.

608
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,010
See I couldn't even take the stand
because I already knew if I take the

609
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:10,940
stand that makes me look like a snitch
and I'm not going to go into prison.

610
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,230
So if you take the stand and talk about
the fight and makes you look like a

611
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,280
snitch.
Yeah.

612
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,620
Because you're like,
he started it.

613
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,170
He did it.
It's just the,

614
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,170
you know,
it's the politics of I had to accept the

615
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:27,560
fact where I was coming from and it was
the punishment that was like when I

616
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,180
started realizing in my head like,
alright dog,

617
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,730
you chose this,
now you have to accept this.

618
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,470
You're not going to be one of those
guys.

619
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:34,730
This is,
oh,

620
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,080
rats and mountain.
You get away with it.

621
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,870
No.
So I didn't take the stand and they're

622
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:40,640
last.
Wow.

623
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,660
Well if you did take the stand,
well,

624
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:44,460
what could you possibly have said you,
you,

625
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,840
I think I would have incriminated myself
because I,

626
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,030
I mean in my head I remember like

627
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,150
fuck,
you've never been to court so when you

628
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,210
go to court,
like they assign a jury and when you go

629
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,030
they give you like a lunch break and you
go eat my stupid ass when and ate like

630
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:06,060
where the jury was eating and I could
tell the way they're looking at me

631
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,010
because I'm in a suit and I go to Burger
King,

632
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:09,900
I take my suit off.
I'm like fuck this,

633
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,940
I'm all tatted up now.
Like look at this guy,

634
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,670
right?
Like they just threw judgment on me and

635
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,030
I remember my brother telling me,
you looked like you had no remorse.

636
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,180
You were in there laughing and court and
I was just like,

637
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,410
fuck.
I didn't know.

638
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,090
I didn't know.
You know what I mean?

639
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:28,980
Like fuck it.
It's court cases.

640
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,130
I would imagine it would be so difficult
to because no one wants to do fucking

641
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:32,964
jury duty.

642
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,420
I got my friend Andreas Antonopoulos was
here the other day,

643
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,960
was talking about how he got out of jury
duty by just explaining how much he

644
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:42,990
knows about the judicial system,
how corrupt he thinks it is and how

645
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:45,060
fucked up he thinks it is.
And they were like,

646
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,020
get outta here out.
Nobody wants to do jury duty.

647
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,190
If you like your job and you do
something that you enjoy now you're

648
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:55,260
going to spend eight hours a day,
you know,

649
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,070
trying to deliberate and figure out why
people make such quick judgements.

650
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,160
I think it's a terrible way to decide
whether or not someone's guilty or

651
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:03,030
innocent.
Yeah,

652
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:05,940
you're exactly right.
And it's weird because like the jury,

653
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,530
like,
I think they wanted it.

654
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,710
It was a weird,
it was like an ex cop and I was like,

655
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,140
why did you let this ex cop get on the
panel?

656
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm already guilty because of my look.
Right,

657
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,490
right.
You know,

658
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,740
it's like imagine if these cops that are
shooting people the whole panels.

659
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,540
Prisoners.
Yeah.

660
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,210
That'd be hilarious.
You know what I mean?

661
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:30,090
A good luck
saw.

662
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:32,810
Yes.
So Alright Joe,

663
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,410
check this out.
So now I'm out,

664
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,090
I think I'm gonna win it.
Boom.

665
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,500
Joey Diaz calls me up.
Hey,

666
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,500
we're going to do showtime comedy slam.
I was like,

667
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,140
what the fuck?
He gets me off my ass all comedy slim.

668
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,330
So I,
I get on showtime.

669
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,830
Uh,
I did a comedy central.

670
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,020
I did like a sketch comedy and then I go
to court bone.

671
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,033
I lose

672
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,170
it wouldn't usually when you lose they
let you go home.

673
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,130
All right,
I'll come back.

674
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,910
But since I was a high risk inmate now
they took me right there,

675
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,300
like from court in a suit straight to
the holding tank.

676
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,760
Who?
Yeah,

677
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,180
that was a shock.
Oh.

678
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,010
And my showtime hasn't even come out
yet.

679
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:19,980
I hadn't even seen this thing.
So it's like everything I've worked for

680
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,510
got took.
That's why I looked at it at that time.

681
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,610
I won't forget that day I walked down
there,

682
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:28,970
I had his fucking suit on.
I've ever everybody looking at me like,

683
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:30,320
damn,
this was a baller.

684
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:30,950
I was like,
Nah,

685
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,110
I just lost my case.
I wasn't on the street.

686
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,430
And then from there you go to the county
because now they got to give you a

687
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,900
sentencing.
The judge has to come up with a

688
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:43,690
sentence.
You kind of familiar with this.

689
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,250
So
a month in the county jail,

690
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,240
a riot breaks out.

691
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,480
Now I have to involve myself.
I know where I'm at,

692
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,070
I know what's going on.
So now they put me in the hole and I got

693
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:01,780
to go to court to get sentenced.
So you have to involve yourself.

694
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:03,490
Meaning you have to pick a side,
you have to fight.

695
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,901
Yeah.
What's the,

696
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:08,290
what's the right about A.
I don't know,

697
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,240
I just seen my people fighting other
people on the uterus.

698
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,870
You don't ask questions,
there's no questions to be asked.

699
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,960
And let me and let me give you a picture
of what's going on.

700
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,980
It's a,
it's like a huge fuck.

701
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,690
Yeah.
It's kind of like a,

702
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,510
it's on msnbc where they got all the
cells on top and on the bottom.

703
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,300
And then there's like a,
we call it the bubble where the police

704
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:32,320
are,
it's a big bubble.

705
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,310
And uh,
there was a riot happening like all on

706
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:40,270
the whole other side,
so we had to run down there and then

707
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,000
they come in and they shoot you with a
paintball guns.

708
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,990
But they have like peppermints not
pepper pepper spraying them and they're

709
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,810
shooting you a paintball guns,
pepper spray block guns,

710
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,720
rubber band.
All that Shit's flying off in there and

711
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:56,320
you're trying to run back to your bunk.
The only way to get out of a riot is to

712
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,660
show they look at everybody's hands and
they say,

713
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,530
Hey,
know your hands are marked.

714
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:02,830
Your any mark you have,
you're going to the hole.

715
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,230
So if you have marks on your hands and
indicate that you punched somebody.

716
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,750
Yes.
Even if you got punched.

717
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,050
Yeah you don't.
I don't.

718
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,470
You don't do that in there now it gets
crazy,

719
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,660
man.
Like some people will throw hot water on

720
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:17,494
you.
Whoo.

721
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,700
Yeah.
It's,

722
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,610
it's all out for everybody.
This is just the county.

723
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,580
And did you ever find out what the ride
was about?

724
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,600
No,
I didn't.

725
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,220
You don't,
you don't ask questions.

726
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,390
The more questions you ask,
the more people will want to.

727
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,880
Oh you want to find out who did.
All right Mr. investigator,

728
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,020
come on,
we got something for you.

729
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,870
So I just,
I stayed quiet.

730
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,373
No.
Alright.

731
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,860
And if you know,
I was just like,

732
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:44,770
Hey,
I was there because he just knew what,

733
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,500
what you had to do.
You knew what your role had to be in

734
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:49,000
order to stay safe.
Yeah,

735
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,850
dude,
I've heard other stories from other

736
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:53,230
inmates that are like,
yeah,

737
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:55,780
dog.
I went to Chino and there's a riot going

738
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,170
on and I told myself,
fuck,

739
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,420
if I don't get in this I'm going to have
to pay.

740
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,990
He's like,
I just ran and I jumped into it and he

741
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:06,610
got stabbed.
Wow.

742
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,870
Yeah.
But he goes,

743
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:11,560
Hey doc,
I got my stripes and I was that wow,

744
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,310
what is the stripe?
What do you mean by stripes?

745
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,400
Stripes is Kinda like a saying like,
you know,

746
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,410
the homies down disguise down every.
I don't know how other races do it,

747
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,320
but like,
you know,

748
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,203
it's like,
Hey,

749
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,320
I've been with this foreigner yard.
He's down for his,

750
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,230
you know,
because you want to be by someone that

751
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,210
you're in there to protect your life.
So you want to be with people like that.

752
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,310
You know what I mean?
I mean,

753
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,410
you're trying to go home and better
yourself,

754
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,220
but at the end of the day,

755
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,950
no.
So on a lot of ways,

756
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,760
like with a riot,
you want someone that's like a soldier.

757
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,740
You want a soda,
a soldier,

758
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,920
you don't want a soldier going asking
the sergeant a sergeant,

759
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,780
what is the plant?
Why are we doing this?

760
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,940
Do we know who these people are?
What did they do to us?

761
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,510
Is this right for hr?
You know you want sir?

762
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,100
Yes sir.
That's what you want.

763
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,910
You want someone who's just going to go,
but in there it's just,

764
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,910
you know,
any little disrespect and triggered and

765
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,890
start anything and you just have to
follow suit.

766
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,400
Like if you're my celly and the cop
pushes or punches you,

767
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I have to jump in for you no matter.
Even if I'm going home that day or the

768
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,160
next day it goes down.
You have to.

769
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,770
It's just what it is.
So the riot breaks out,

770
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:28,220
you get involved in riot,
you get thrown in the hole and then what

771
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:32,180
happens is I'm in the hall and the whole
fucking horrible.

772
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,650
I get staff on my fucking ass on the
side because they only gave me one bar

773
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:41,651
soap and I was in there for 28 days and
then I remember I was cleaning my toilet

774
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,960
with it in my room with the soap and
then I ran out.

775
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:48,950
So I was just taking showers with water
and then I noticed I had like an ingrown

776
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:52,250
hair on the side and it just got
infected.

777
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,490
So that's how it starts for us.
Yeah.

778
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,780
And it's crazy because there's a little,
there's a little button you can push,

779
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,370
like if you're dying.
And I had like A.

780
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,880
I had a fever and I've ever pushed the
button until the car at.

781
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,753
Amen.

782
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,850
I know it's night shift and I don't want
to bug you [inaudible] man.

783
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,910
But my.
I didn't say I got my ass is bleeding,

784
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,170
but I was like [inaudible],
you have to have a.

785
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:22,210
At the sight of my ass is bleeding.
So you're gonna need to call Yvette

786
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,300
Yvette,
you're going to have you to call

787
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,840
somebody and he just like stopped
playing games.

788
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm like,
and they have cameras in there.

789
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,560
I was like look.
So I showed them and then they come in

790
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,590
and you got to put your arms in there
because they're gonna be a plant.

791
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,550
I don't know.
They're scared for their life.

792
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:40,010
So he handcuffed me or then that gets
taken care of and then I go to

793
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,260
court and I get sentenced to three
years.

794
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,130
So do you think it would have been less
if it wasn't for the riot?

795
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,070
No,
the,

796
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,070
the,
the riot was,

797
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,830
it was cool because at that time when it
was going on,

798
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,740
there was riots breaking out everywhere.
And my lawyer was like,

799
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,420
listen,
your honor,

800
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,700
he was only in a riot to have to protect
his life.

801
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,710
You know,
how you don't know what's going on in

802
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:05,410
there.
And the judge was cool.

803
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,960
A lot of my family and friends wrote
letters for me telling the judge,

804
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,590
hey man,
this guy changed his life.

805
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,440
He's got the best peanut butter math you
can get hands on.

806
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,610
So that amount of hooky up.
Yeah.

807
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,660
Oh yeah.
So you know,

808
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,840
cause a Gbi it's a great bodily injury.
That's a felony that carries a three

809
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,180
year,
like on top of your time.

810
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,570
It's like supposed to and goes,
I'm gonna.

811
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,430
Strike that down.
And I was just like Oh my God.

812
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,280
And in my head I'm thinking,
oh you only do half time.

813
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:47,280
So I'm gonna get out year and a half
because he even told me you're doing

814
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:49,680
good guy,
but somebody got hurt.

815
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,353
And I was like,
all right.

816
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,290
So boom.
I hit Wasco while skulls or reception

817
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:02,190
yard where like if you're from Orange
County,

818
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,110
la,
Bakersfield,

819
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:10,200
and I think some part of Riverside they
send you to that yard for reception.

820
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,900
It's where you for 90 days you're on
lockdown,

821
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,400
23 hour lockdown and you only get like
an hour of day room and they're

822
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:21,210
evaluating you to see how you act with
other inmates.

823
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,130
Where are they going to put you?
Or they're going to put you on a level

824
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,750
four yard.
A level three yard.

825
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:25,710
I love a two yard.

826
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,030
Yeah.
Do you don't want to level four?

827
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,960
Level three,
two is now give me the difference.

828
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,020
A level four yard is for people that um,
have a lot of points like violent crime.

829
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:39,741
Like,
oh,

830
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,650
he's in here for carjacking kidnapping
on all that.

831
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:46,150
You're going on to level four yard.
You're going to be on a 23 hour lockdown

832
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,260
and you're there with killers.
Lifers,

833
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:53,261
people doing 10 to 15 to 20 years.
A level three yard is the same thing,

834
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:55,960
but your programming,
you're getting your own.

835
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,160
It goes down,
it goes down,

836
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:01,280
but it's chill.
Then there's a level two yard where it's

837
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:01,611
like,
all right,

838
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:03,570
this guy got three years left,
you know,

839
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,100
we try to get them an outside job,
a little more money and then level one

840
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:10,460
yard is like,
go walk around in sandals.

841
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,810
I've heard,
I've never been on that.

842
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:16,811
I heard you go walk around in sandals.
There's a microwave in the day room has

843
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:20,030
an ice machine.
So what does that for like white collar

844
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,500
crime?
No,

845
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:26,590
a level one yard would be like,
this guy's been locked up for 10 years

846
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:29,950
on drugs.
He's going home.

847
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:33,790
He's done all nine years.
One year left permanent level one yard

848
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,380
because he's proven he can program as
long as you're not causing problems.

849
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,380
The point system makes you drop.
I think it's from one to 17 is level one

850
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:49,381
yard and 17 to 32 is a level two yard
and 32 to 40 something or is a level

851
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,330
three.
Then it goes far enough up to life.

852
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,390
Yeah.
Like I,

853
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:59,650
I knew buddies that were like a dog.
How many points you got to go?

854
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,090
I'm lucky I'm going to like,
I was.

855
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,760
They sent me to a level two yard after I
was on a three yard.

856
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,950
Now he was like,
oh my God.

857
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:10,690
Like these inmates treated like you're
going to a level two.

858
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:13,930
Oh my God.
Cause they're like,

859
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:16,540
you're going to.
You can have a TV in your cell.

860
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,950
It's like it's.
Yeah,

861
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,740
it's like a heaven.
Wow.

862
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,660
Yeah.
The food's better.

863
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,220
Oh Man.
So much shit about prison.

864
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,630
I,
I miss food now in there.

865
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,520
You miss food in prison.

866
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,930
What kind of food did you get in prison?
We used to make food spreads and I

867
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,400
worked in the butcher shop so I would
sneak meat in my socks.

868
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:41,200
I'd wrap it up and like,
like Saran wrap and I'd put it in my

869
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:44,230
boots and this boot I had big old
firemen,

870
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:49,231
boots and I would fit to like two
sandwiches in each booth.

871
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,070
And that's like eight bucks in prison.
That's fucking nuts.

872
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,270
Money,
especially if you're making thirty eight

873
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,840
cents an hour.
So we'd bring it back.

874
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,250
This time I'm living in a dorm hundred
man dorm and we will bring it back and

875
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:04,840
me and all my friends,
my people,

876
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,150
we'd cut it up.
Everyone would have a job.

877
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:09,820
I already dog,
I ain't got nothing to pitch in but I'll

878
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,430
prepare the food and I'll,
I'll clean all the dishes are done.

879
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,570
All right,
cool.

880
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,870
Everybody will contribute and then we'd
make like our bunk is equivalent from

881
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:23,830
here to that chair and we would eat on a
bunk.

882
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,660
We put like a big piece of paper and we
would just,

883
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,230
it'd be cup of noodles to retos slim
jims cheese.

884
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,693
Uh,

885
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,220
says ship pork grinds,
beans,

886
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,180
rice,
corn,

887
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:40,010
nuts.
Anything that we had and we were just

888
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:44,420
mixing in that's done.
And did anybody ever like,

889
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:45,790
uh,
the,

890
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,040
like the prison guards ever come by and
get you get in trouble for this checking

891
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,491
on you?
Oh,

892
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,500
that's routine.
They know what we're doing.

893
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,240
So they don't have a problem with it and
they don't.

894
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:01,330
As long as what I noticed in prison,
they just don't want no one to overdose

895
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,170
or fight.
Yeah.

896
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,140
I remember this one guy,
like,

897
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,070
we're not a lot of talk to guards.
I could hear them talking to each other.

898
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,600
This one guy goes,
man,

899
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:14,060
I hate my job.
I'm the fucking most overpriced

900
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:17,660
babysitter in the world.
All I have to do is make sure these guys

901
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:20,120
don't kill each other and they're
hitting here for killing each other.

902
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,920
Fuck.
Yeah.

903
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,260
So yeah,
it's pretty crazy.

904
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,320
And what did you cook it on?
Oh,

905
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,800
that,
that's a good idea.

906
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,850
I mean,
good question.

907
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,743
So,
uh,

908
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,380
we get this thing called a stinger,
like there's so many brilliant like

909
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:41,120
inventions people make in prison.
This guy would get a cord for the radio,

910
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,390
cut it in half,
get a metal piece and connect like some

911
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:47,990
we'd make like this thing and then you
plug it into the wall,

912
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,410
drop it into like a five gallon water
bucket,

913
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,370
like those buckets.
And then we put all the food in a

914
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,530
plastic bags so the water wouldn't hit
it,

915
00:40:57,531 --> 00:41:00,800
but it would steam cook it.
That's how we would cook.

916
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,400
Whoa.
There was even by size that can make

917
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:07,700
grills like because there's a metal shop
in there,

918
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:08,950
like you work metal

919
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,350
us as prisoners,
like the prison doesn't call plumbing to

920
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:17,660
fix the prison.
We have our own plumbing crews,

921
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,930
like inmates are plumbers,
inmates are everything.

922
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:25,931
So we learned to fix all this stuff and
you know when it's there you're like

923
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,080
damn,
I want to make a grilled cheese

924
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:32,600
sandwich.
So where we were at,

925
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:36,380
they had those heaters that are metal
and you get your bread and you put it in

926
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:39,720
the Brown bag and you just put it in
there and 20 minutes later to Melton and

927
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,200
it is a grilled cheese.
Wow.

928
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,090
What is the fine art of cooking in
prison?

929
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:46,790
What is this champion?
Just trying to find out the Stinger.

930
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,340
I found a couple of pictures,
but this is a better picture of.

931
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,181
Oh,
okay.

932
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:53,740
So he's got wires attached to toenail
clippers.

933
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,190
That's another way to.
And the toenail clippers get get hot

934
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,960
electrified and they boiled the ramen
noodles.

935
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,550
The Stinger is the one on the far left.
That one right there.

936
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,280
You see how it's in there and that's how
we did it,

937
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,980
but we did it with the five gallon.
Wow.

938
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,250
Yeah.
There was this guy that he would put

939
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,110
loud.
Lowery's is addressing right sauce.

940
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,890
Yeah.
He would pick a spice route.

941
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:23,020
He would get the spice and he would put
water in it and he would plug it into

942
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:27,510
the fucking wall for somehow and this
little spring,

943
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:32,511
like spring with light up like and
that's isolated cigarettes.

944
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:35,240
He's like,
whoa.

945
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:35,991
Yeah.
And I'd be like,

946
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,340
this fool man.
A lighter

947
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,200
where they make their own tattoo guns
too.

948
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,710
That's all my tattoos are.
Eighty percent of my tattoos are from

949
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,060
prison.
Wow.

950
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,280
Now is that legal in prison?
No,

951
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,091
no,
no,

952
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:53,880
because that's how you get infections
before.

953
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,580
That's the other big thing.
Uh,

954
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:59,370
what's that thing called
A.

955
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,610
I don't know.
Somebody has it,

956
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,690
but yeah.
But I love my tattoos.

957
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,990
Like hepatitis.
Yeah.

958
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:09,620
Hepatitis is huge because everyone's
sharing needles,

959
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:13,190
but no one does that really.
Like you get your own needle and you

960
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,880
take care of it.
Like I have my,

961
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,670
I've used my same needle the whole three
years.

962
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:19,250
I was there.
Your same tattoo needle and did you make

963
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:19,881
it?
Yeah,

964
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:24,260
you get a
guitar string is what they use,

965
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:28,340
but that's huge.
Like you see how this is way thicker.

966
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,140
That's the guitar string and not hurt
and this is more of like we use like the

967
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:38,030
wire because wire brush on the brooms so
we just take the little things off and

968
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,890
sharpen them up,
sanitize it.

969
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,120
Wow.
And how are they using the.

970
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,390
Like how are they doing a tattoo?
Like what is tapping the ink in it?

971
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,440
They're doing it by hand.

972
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,450
I know there's a,
you get a,

973
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,510
a motor from a Walkman or like a Walkman
in prison tapes and cds or there's no

974
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:57,020
fucking downloads in there.
Joe,

975
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,910
you can't
cassette tape because that same presence

976
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
to.
I used to have the beastie boys and I

977
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:06,290
sold that.
I gave it to my boy and I laughed.

978
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,310
Like,
hey man,

979
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,400
it's it.
It's kind of like fucking being locked

980
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,730
up in American pickers,
like old technologies existing hardcore

981
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,990
in prison.
Wow.

982
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,890
And so Walkman,
if the Walkman messes up,

983
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:23,891
they take the motor out and then they
make it like there's just like the shop,

984
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:26,510
they got a little gas pedal.
Like they just wire it up.

985
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,910
Yeah,
there it is.

986
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:29,780
Exactly.
What is that?

987
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:32,490
That looks like an ink pen while it's a
pencil.

988
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,930
And then he's just that right there is
the motor in the back.

989
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,150
That's the motor for it.
It's a button.

990
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,180
So the button attaches to the motor?
Yes.

991
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,550
And is a string on that.
So it goes up and down.

992
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,770
So forces the needle to go up and I'll
sit here,

993
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:50,010
goes drive pin on top of the motor turns
the spindle.

994
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,380
The spindle causes the connecting pin to
rotate as the back end of the draw of

995
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,320
the drive rod rotates with the pin,
the needle moves backwards and forwards.

996
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,820
Wow.
And you have to make your own ink.

997
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,180
So what are you doing for ink?
So you get the newspaper and you burn it

998
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:13,590
in a brown bag.
You just let it burn in the sun.

999
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:19,010
The ink from the paper is becomes ashes
and you get all these ashes and you put

1000
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:24,060
it in like a like this or like a little
like advil or like a little aspirin

1001
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:27,180
thing and he put two little rocks in
there at three and then a little bit of

1002
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:31,740
water and shake that shit for three or
four days and it will become the ink

1003
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:32,070
again.

1004
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,540
Three or four days.
Yeah,

1005
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,860
it's a long process.
I had to figure out how you got.

1006
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,280
You got all day,
you get plenty of time.

1007
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,860
Yeah.
I mean you don't do it for 24 hours,

1008
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:42,380
you just come back.
That is it,

1009
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,240
that it's it.
Cause I've had tattoos that fall off

1010
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,230
like the ink on this one.
It wasn't done right.

1011
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,250
I see,
and it's faded off because they didn't

1012
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,630
let it sit in the.
Exactly.

1013
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,010
Wow.
So all those,

1014
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:58,260
like the stomach one,
all that shit is all dad.

1015
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,420
The stomach one.
I'll never forget.

1016
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,673
Painful.
Huh?

1017
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,960
Fuck.
At that time it was painful.

1018
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,040
Is the gooners came in and hit the house
like the gooners?

1019
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,240
Yeah,
I remember I was telling you in,

1020
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,330
in prison they have a swat team to.
It's called the gooners.

1021
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,360
These are ceos that specialize in gang.
Any gang activity,

1022
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:20,940
any riot,
anybody has contraband.

1023
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,120
Like they just come in and raid the
whole yard.

1024
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,580
Like,
do you know what I mean?

1025
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,400
Like,
like throwing mattresses everywhere.

1026
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:33,150
Ripping shit up.
So I'm getting this tattoo on my stomach

1027
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,470
and they come in and I'll catch you in
the middle again.

1028
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,430
No,
I hit it.

1029
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,140
You hit it.
Covered my shit up.

1030
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,980
My friend,
he cheeked it.

1031
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:44,340
He,
you see how little they shooked yeah.

1032
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:47,520
He took the uh,
the pink top off and just do it in the

1033
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:51,720
trash and then you put the motor up.
Not up his ass but like in the ass,

1034
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,690
like cheeked it.
He put it a Napkin and uh,

1035
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,390
I was,
I just remember he was like,

1036
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,250
hey man,
I don't think I'm going to be able to

1037
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:01,260
come tomorrow.
So do you want to finish this?

1038
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,450
Like,
let's go dog.

1039
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:08,670
We just sanitized it.
Wow.

1040
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,990
Yeah,
we stole Lysol.

1041
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,940
I mean we didn't steal it.
It's ours.

1042
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,400
It's the prisons that we just,
we took it and that wasn't a little

1043
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:17,050
thing.
They don't let you have lysol wipes it

1044
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,550
out because it worried you spray it on.
People are like on fire.

1045
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,350
It's like things you light lights on
fire and spray people.

1046
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,213
Okay.
Yeah.

1047
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,210
But it's Kinda like,
do you know how much diseases and Shit

1048
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,350
isn't there?
I would imagine quite a bit.

1049
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:34,390
And was chicken tattoo machines and
that's how sound theory.

1050
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,410
That's crazy.
So if you had gotten caught like getting

1051
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:40,090
the Tattoo,
like what would happen?

1052
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,070
So if you get caught now,
I think they give you a 1:15 now.

1053
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:51,150
One 15 can make you get bad points.
So like say I'm on a level two yard and

1054
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:53,830
I get caught getting tatted.

1055
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,661
They're like,
hey homie,

1056
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:56,260
you,
we don't want this here.

1057
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,710
That's for the crazier yard,
so they ship you over there.

1058
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,450
Wow.
Just for a tattoo.

1059
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,900
Yeah,
because to them you're.

1060
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,270
You've hurt your body,
but it's hilarious.

1061
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,190
Yeah.
There's some good tattoo artist in

1062
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:11,680
prison though.
I've seen some great work that came out

1063
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,110
of prison.
There's some bomb ass guys in there.

1064
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,090
Yeah.
There's some websites that are dedicated

1065
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:18,850
to great tattoo art from prison CV.
Find some of that,

1066
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:22,090
but some of those guys are like legit
artists,

1067
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,200
like as good or close to it as like Mr.
Cartoon.

1068
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,420
Like that level.
I've seen some like high level.

1069
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:29,590
I've seen some.
Yeah.

1070
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:33,100
I mean I'm pretty sure Mr. cartoon
rumors are.

1071
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:34,090
I Dunno,
I won't call it,

1072
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:38,140
but I know artists that do their friends
are doing life in prison and they send

1073
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:39,300
them patterns like that.

1074
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,590
Yeah.
That is from fucking jail.

1075
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah.
That's amazing.

1076
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,170
And that's not when no shop.
You can't Google expand.

1077
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,550
None of that.
Damn.

1078
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,860
Look how good that is.
That's a.

1079
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,200
it's.
That's a Tom Hardy,

1080
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,550
right?
The one on the left from.

1081
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,720
From Brian Charles Bronson,
right?

1082
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:00,640
It's from Bronson,
the movie Bronson.

1083
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,680
Yeah.
I love that movie.

1084
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:04,950
It was about a crazy prisoner.
He was off.

1085
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,700
I think he's from England.
Yeah.

1086
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,480
Have you seen that movie?
Yeah.

1087
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,330
Long time ago though.
I hardly remember it,

1088
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:15,130
but I remember he still locked up.
That guy is really 40 years in solitary

1089
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:16,480
confinement now.
Whoa.

1090
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,630
Four zero.
Four zero.

1091
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,960
That can't be good.
No,

1092
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,430
no.
That's not good.

1093
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,720
Tattoo artists praises Charles Bronson.
Oh,

1094
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:28,721
it is Charles Bronson Bronson the movie.
The guy's name is Charles Charles

1095
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,890
Bronson award winning tattoo by the
prisoner himself.

1096
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:34,811
Oh,
wait a minute,

1097
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:35,644
Jamie.
That's not.

1098
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,080
That's not a prison tattoo.
Then seed sent.

1099
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,290
Tattoo artists praised for Charles
Bronson award winning tattoo by the

1100
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,880
prisoner.
Charles Bronson.

1101
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,670
I was saying that.
Let me give you a better code words when

1102
00:49:45,671 --> 00:49:49,120
you Google Prison Tattoos,
a r t,

1103
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:54,121
e
d e prison all over his face.

1104
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,860
That seems like a weird choice.
Oh Man.

1105
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,500
I see those all day in there.
Yeah.

1106
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,790
That's an odd choice.
Is that now is that dudes that are just

1107
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:03,220
doing life and I'm like,
yeah,

1108
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,060
I mean,
yeah.

1109
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,590
I mean at the same time,
man,

1110
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:07,090
there's a lot of people in there that
are.

1111
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,670
That's all they know.
Dad Has it,

1112
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:12,670
mom has it,
and when he has it and I was their

1113
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:15,670
soldiers right there.
That's this letting you know it's going

1114
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:17,410
down.
Do not walk this way.

1115
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,850
It goes down.
Well,

1116
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,410
if you're willing to do that to your
face,

1117
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,310
you don't have a whole lot to lose the
face tattoos.

1118
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,300
A rough man.
That's.

1119
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,610
That's a strange look.
Is that.

1120
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,500
No,
because you can't get no color in

1121
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:32,710
prison.
You can't.

1122
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,140
No.
It'd be too hard to make unless,

1123
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:37,770
I mean,
I don't know if they sneak enemy the

1124
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,080
sneaking print.
Pretty much anything,

1125
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:39,970
right?
I don't think.

1126
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:42,460
No.
I was trying to sneak in tattoo tattoo

1127
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:45,410
ink for that risk.
Maybe you would if you knew the dude was

1128
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:47,480
just so fucking good.
Like if you got.

1129
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,270
If you were doing time with a dude who
was a known tattoo,

1130
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:53,180
artists like,
I'm Aaron Dellavedova is got to do all

1131
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:56,150
my work in San Diego.
If I was locked up with that dude,

1132
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:58,010
I tried to sneak some tattoo ink in.

1133
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,970
Fuck the lead.
Let's go to work.

1134
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,200
Let's get some shit done.
I mean see that.

1135
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,030
That would be his hustle on there,
so I'm pretty sure if he's that good,

1136
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,740
he'd come around and get people to make
it.

1137
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,960
Lots of people's Hustle.
That's all they do.

1138
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,430
Like for this tattoo,
I only paid a pack of cup of noodles.

1139
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,030
Cup of noodles.
Now is that like what?

1140
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,180
Like the.
Is that what currency is in prison?

1141
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,950
Cigarettes.
Company noodles.

1142
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,050
Well,
cigarettes isn't currency,

1143
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:32,660
but it is because it's banded.
Used to be currency,

1144
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:34,790
but it's flat now.
Yeah.

1145
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:39,791
It's food in any material items like.
So you can't get any cigarettes in

1146
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:41,540
prison at all.
It's not,

1147
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,430
don't get them,
but it's not legal.

1148
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,300
No.
Yeah.

1149
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,400
Wow.
So if you are a cigarette person,

1150
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:47,840
you smoked three packs of cigarettes a
day,

1151
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:50,330
you go to jail.
Set Cold Turkey.

1152
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,650
And that was the first time I stopped.

1153
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,530
Oh yeah.
I didn't get a cigarette for the first

1154
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,240
10 months.
Wow.

1155
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,910
Yeah.
And then I had a sally that came from

1156
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:03,170
Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara.
They let you have cigarettes in their

1157
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:06,050
farming.
So homey snuck it.

1158
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,030
I want to know.
I don't know how he did it,

1159
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:12,740
but probably represent.
So when you're farming,

1160
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,750
like you're out there farming in Santa
Barbara,

1161
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:16,190
then you can have cigarettes?
Yeah,

1162
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,040
because it's an outside facility.
Oh,

1163
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:20,840
okay.
It's not in trapped in the building.

1164
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,033
Oh,
okay.

1165
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,010
So was the idea about smoking in the
building that you don't want people to

1166
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,570
get secondhand smoke or something like
that?

1167
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:29,240
Is that what it is?
I think that that's what they said.

1168
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,350
This is 2000.
This happened in 2006,

1169
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:37,340
2007.
So there laws might've changed.

1170
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,730
It was interesting because when I first
moved here in 94,

1171
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,730
you could still smoke in bars.
You could smoke everywhere,

1172
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,900
everywhere had cigarettes.

1173
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,610
I believe that comedy store had
cigarettes,

1174
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:50,030
if I remember correctly,
I believe that ash trays on every table,

1175
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,100
if I remember correctly.
Yeah,

1176
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:54,290
yeah.
If I remember correctly,

1177
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:59,180
I know a lot of clubs I worked at had
smoking until the two thousands.

1178
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,520
Dallas was one of the last holdouts.
I used to do the Addison Improv and they

1179
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:06,790
would still have smoking,
but they would have like.

1180
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,680
Then they started having like an 8:00 PM
nonsmoking show,

1181
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,280
toddlers.
But I didn't mind it,

1182
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,110
you know.
And I know it's probably bad for you,

1183
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,700
but then I started hearing about women
that would be like waitresses and bars

1184
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,700
and they would work there for 15 years
now get lung cancer and it's like,

1185
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:23,160
oh,
that's real.

1186
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,440
That's real.
Yeah.

1187
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,070
That's when I was like,
because I was

1188
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,180
against it to like,
what the fuck?

1189
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:28,980
I can't smoke because America.
Then you're like,

1190
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:29,910
oh,
I'm fucking her up.

1191
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,813
Sorry.
My bad.

1192
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,150
Yeah.
So when you went away,

1193
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,340
how hard was it to quit cigarettes?
Was that one of the hardest things to

1194
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:37,240
do?
Ha.

1195
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,810
Fuck.
I never thought of this.

1196
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,960
But your mind,
I mean you're looking for,

1197
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,310
you're at,
you're aggravated,

1198
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,020
but Nah,
but you weren't doing this like the

1199
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:54,000
tweakers spinning this thing when you're
met with the folks you're trying to do.

1200
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,530
Did you go back to smoking when you got
out?

1201
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,850
Yeah,
I had

1202
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,790
because I was smoking in there.
You weren't.

1203
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,330
I was getting them later because I had
that butcher job.

1204
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:06,780
So I was trading meet for cigarettes all
day.

1205
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,270
All Day.
Like a couple of cigarettes here and

1206
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:10,430
there.
Fuck yeah.

1207
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,170
Like how many kids you get a day?
Man,

1208
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:18,171
I was living like a ball or joe realized
smoked a cigarette every day for at

1209
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:18,810
least a year.

1210
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,690
Wow.
That golf ball or one cigarette?

1211
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,610
One cigarette.
Sometimes more.

1212
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,920
Sometimes more.
And now one cigarette was like,

1213
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:27,090
oh,
here comes,

1214
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:27,820
ha.
No,

1215
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,600
it was weird because make me want to
smoke.

1216
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,470
I'm like,
I had a lighter too.

1217
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,230
So when you have a lighter you can light
other people's cigarettes.

1218
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:38,150
So you're like,
Hey,

1219
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,091
your letter.
Like Nah,

1220
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:39,481
Nah,
Nah,

1221
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:42,840
let me like that for you.
Here you go.

1222
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,220
So yeah,
it was fun.

1223
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,770
It was fun.
Stupid asking me.

1224
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,320
Wow.
When do you smoke now?

1225
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:49,910
Still?
Yeah,

1226
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,440
I still smoke.
How much smoke?

1227
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,990
I smoke about a Duh.
I say a pack a day,

1228
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,780
but if I could I have a lot of things to
do.

1229
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,910
A pack and a half.
Oh yeah.

1230
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,100
But you know what?
I've dropped everything else.

1231
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,320
No more peanut butter.
Meth?

1232
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,700
No,
I haven't done that in ever.

1233
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,950
Fuck that.
Like I don't do nothing else and I just,

1234
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,800
I mean I smoked weed but that's,
that's it's Madison and what kind of

1235
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,663
does what I'm saying?

1236
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,020
I'm now what kind of like,
um,

1237
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,580
weightlifting facilities do they have in
gyms because they are in prison?

1238
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,430
Because I've heard some prisons,
they're trying to take that out.

1239
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,370
They could makes presidents more
dangerous.

1240
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,640
You know,
who took it out to?

1241
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:30,180
It was Arnold Arnold was the one that
took out sugar.

1242
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,340
That is fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1243
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,820
The bodybuilding champion.
That guy took out the weights.

1244
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,460
Yeah.
Wow.

1245
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:41,070
That's fucked up.
So that it's fucked up.

1246
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,990
Yeah.
So like we have to improvise.

1247
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:47,380
So when you're in prison,
you have jumpsuits and everyone was big

1248
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:49,680
clothes.
So you cut the leg off your jumpsuit and

1249
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:53,820
you sold the bottom and you sold the
sides and then you get the other leg and

1250
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:56,490
you do the same thing and then you fill
it up with sand.

1251
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:01,050
Now you have a heavy bag,
so it's probably like 40 pound bag and

1252
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:04,440
then you put,
you just get a tailor guy in there or if

1253
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:06,570
you know how to do it,
you can put two little handles and now

1254
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,120
you can do curls or you can do for and
raises.

1255
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,970
It's like what?
Anything water rates.

1256
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,480
I mean we,
it's wild how he used to work out in

1257
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:16,470
there.
Wow.

1258
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:17,970
So when you were there and you were
working out,

1259
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:19,160
there wasn't any weights?
No.

1260
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,070
There's no way to allow loud at all
because you know,

1261
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:23,860
how many people were,
how much people were killing each other

1262
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,780
with weights?
Yeah.

1263
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:29,140
Just imagine you owe money and you're
doing fucking bench press and somebody

1264
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:30,700
just hit you with the 45 plate on the
head.

1265
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:34,390
It's a one hit.
But that was always the scenes in the

1266
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,990
movies.
Manage weight room or a,

1267
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,910
it looked dope.
I want it to do it.

1268
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,580
Imagine it was all little benches.
Yeah,

1269
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,640
yeah,
yeah.

1270
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:48,550
But they do have them on level one
yards.

1271
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,370
Really fire camp now.
They made it like a privilege.

1272
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:53,530
Like if you're in fire camp,
fire camp,

1273
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,490
fire camp is a,
all the inmates,

1274
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,670
they uh,
make them go brush the fire follows me

1275
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,800
all these huge fires.

1276
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,670
Oh,
okay.

1277
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,760
All the inmates are like,
they're fighting the fires and then

1278
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:09,100
they,
they only do one third of their time.

1279
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,680
That's awesome.
But you can't be a violent offender in

1280
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:14,050
there.
So I was disqualified from that.

1281
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,890
So they do that so that you could be
more robust physically so you can do the

1282
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:19,110
job better.
Yeah.

1283
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,880
And it's just like to privilege.
They don't live in cells.

1284
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:24,910
They live like in a room like this.
Wow.

1285
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,620
And they got bunks and they have like a
little white badge,

1286
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,180
crowbar.
But if anything happens immediately took

1287
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:34,330
away.
So every race decides not to cut.

1288
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,310
Ever happen here.
We need this for all of us.

1289
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,380
So it's like a little like,
hey,

1290
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:40,300
we need this.
Do not fuck this up.

1291
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,520
Wow.
So what did you guys do for

1292
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:45,070
entertainment when you're in there?
Oh Shit.

1293
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,440
Did you do stand up in there at all?

1294
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,820
Yeah,
I did later on.

1295
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,430
That's a crazy question.
No one's ever asked me that.

1296
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,900
That's what Joey got started,
you know?

1297
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,770
Yeah.
But it was different because in my last,

1298
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:00,130
my last year and a half,
I'm locked up in Norco.

1299
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,180
So all these guards are Mexican.
Most of them that are Mexican and

1300
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,830
they're like,
I used to fucking see you at wile

1301
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,170
coyote.
They're like,

1302
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:10,910
I just seen you on showtime.
And they,

1303
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,850
like,
you're at the Ontario Improv,

1304
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:15,960
so you know,
they got together and uh,

1305
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,670
they were like a,
a,

1306
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,800
you want to do comedy.
And I was just like,

1307
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,380
fuck,
I did not want this.

1308
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:27,760
I did not want like to be popular,
you know what I mean?

1309
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,460
Like I didn't want him to stay low key.
Yeah.

1310
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:33,070
Then I was just like a,
I don't know,

1311
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:34,540
man,
like I'm offensive.

1312
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,010
I'll say something that'll start a riot.

1313
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,631
And they're like,
Nah,

1314
00:58:36,631 --> 00:58:36,961
Nah,
Nah,

1315
00:58:36,961 --> 00:58:39,400
Nah.
All the races already said you can say

1316
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:42,090
whatever you want.
Like they planned this shit.

1317
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,701
I was like,
all right,

1318
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:45,430
I'll do it.
So all the races.

1319
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:48,550
So you have to have like a little race
knowing.

1320
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,430
Fuck yeah.
Hell yeah.

1321
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:53,590
So how does that go down?
It's,

1322
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,240
I don't know,
I wasn't involved in it,

1323
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:59,350
it's just so they had to like meet with
maybe the guard went up to the white

1324
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,940
rep,
the black wrap and all the reps was

1325
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:01,451
like,
hey man,

1326
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:02,710
check it out.
You guys.

1327
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,470
We have a celebrity comedian here.
That's how they pumped me up.

1328
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:08,710
I was like,
motherfucker can't even get a week at

1329
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,280
the Improv,
but I could get a weakened prison.

1330
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:13,480
That's a good one.
Thank you.

1331
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:14,763
So,
uh,

1332
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,360
it was,
it was.

1333
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,320
Oh man,
it was weird.

1334
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:19,440
I was scared as hell,
like,

1335
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:24,450
no,
Mike and they put me in the TV room and

1336
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:28,940
there was like 60 straight,
like fools,

1337
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,710
like just like,
come on dog,

1338
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:31,460
make us laugh.

1339
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,500
And like,
you know,

1340
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:37,090
they had never heard my jokes so I did
my whole set and they're just like,

1341
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,530
oh.
And then I guess one of the cops,

1342
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,940
this is the weird part is all the cops
left their dorms to come watch this

1343
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:47,030
show.
And they went back and then they told

1344
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:49,320
the inmates.
So when I go to yard the next day the

1345
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,510
inmates were like,
hey dog,

1346
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,150
how much you charge?
Come do a show in our room.

1347
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,400
I was like,
what do you mean?

1348
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:56,890
They're like,
I heard you did comedy.

1349
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:00,530
And everybody said it was cool.
All the racist said you were cool.

1350
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,770
And I was just like,
I don't think I can go to your dorm.

1351
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,410
Did that's like against the code.
So the cops would be like,

1352
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:11,411
all right everybody give him an item and
you can go in there and perform an item.

1353
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,220
An item is like a soup,
a hot chocolate,

1354
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,920
and that's how people paid to see.
Wow.

1355
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,430
Yeah.
And it got to the point where I did

1356
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,440
every,
everyone on,

1357
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,810
on our yard and a half.
I assembled like a little crew.

1358
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,190
I'm,
I taught this guy had to open for me

1359
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,860
because he was cool as Druggie from
whittier.

1360
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,990
He was just,
he was stupid,

1361
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,660
funny,
taught him how to do standup and he knew

1362
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,340
it but didn't know.
He knew it.

1363
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,230
He knew it,
but he never did it Jack.

1364
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,060
Because like,
I remember he'd be like a dog when I'm

1365
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:46,280
on the street,
he has fucked up teeth.

1366
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:48,110
It's like I called,
I called girls and I'm like,

1367
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,460
they're like,
how's your body?

1368
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:51,470
And he's like,
I just smiled like Chisel.

1369
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,353
I was like,
oh,

1370
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,240
that's a setup right there.
Like you're just,

1371
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,560
he did it.
And uh,

1372
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,940
the look on his face was cool man.
But I just remember he was like,

1373
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:03,350
Hey dad,
I'm gonna hit you up when I get out,

1374
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:04,490
we're going to go on the tour.
I'm like,

1375
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,650
no,
you're a fucking tweaker.

1376
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,300
Well,
it's fine because people that can make

1377
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,730
people laugh.
If I always tell people,

1378
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,940
like if you can make your friends laugh,
you can make people,

1379
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:17,870
you know,
laugh.

1380
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:21,050
It's entirely possible that you could be
a comedian.

1381
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,080
It's the same thing.
It's just a matter of whether or not you

1382
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:27,230
get these people to allow you inside
their head.

1383
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,660
Yeah.
That's kind of what it is,

1384
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:30,321
right?
Yeah.

1385
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,060
The true comfortableness.
But you know,

1386
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:37,061
some of them wasn't like I had a rough
time a couple first 10 minutes because

1387
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:40,280
fools were like,
I thought you were going to do George

1388
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:40,950
Lopez his jokes.

1389
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:41,661
I was like,
no,

1390
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:42,690
I'm not.
I'm,

1391
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,640
I'm not an impersonator.
Like,

1392
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,690
like fools were pissed.
They're like,

1393
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,520
hey,
you didn't do any member members or

1394
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:51,050
nothing like that.
Oh,

1395
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:53,420
that's funny.
So they just thought,

1396
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,350
stand up comedy is kind of like music.
Yeah.

1397
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,520
Like he would just go up there and do
some hits.

1398
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,520
Yeah,
they didn't know this is the crazy part

1399
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:04,400
is uh,
the award and catches wind of this shit

1400
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,720
and I'm in a program called sap,
it's substance abuse program and I'm

1401
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:11,960
only in it because you qualify for
halftime if you take this program.

1402
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:15,470
So the wardens like,
hey Sacramento's coming down here,

1403
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,040
I want to show them a rehabilitated con,
criminal,

1404
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,873
whatever.
I'm a felon,

1405
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,110
whatever.
So I was like,

1406
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:22,921
what are you talking about?
He's like,

1407
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:26,130
well,
you do comedy in front of the program

1408
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,020
and Sacramento,
but no cussing.

1409
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,810
Uh,
no.

1410
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,880
Like I think this was the easiest deal
I've ever met.

1411
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,091
I said,
look,

1412
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:39,420
I'll do it if you bring me Kentucky
Fried Chicken

1413
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,670
and Soda Joe.
I was just saying that the talk show,

1414
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,990
you know how like when I first started
getting gigs,

1415
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,680
I'd always call joy de is,
hey,

1416
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,520
they're going to give me 700 if I go do
visalia,

1417
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,980
like dumb ass,
I don't give it.

1418
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:03,350
So after the show he gives me two,
two liters of coke and a fucking bucket

1419
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,360
of Kentucky.
Oh Man.

1420
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,690
And he was just like,
I remember walking back and everybody

1421
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:12,840
was like,
I gave all my people a piece and it was

1422
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:14,610
just like,
it was Kinda like a,

1423
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,590
that movie,
Shawshank redemption when they're

1424
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:19,380
drinking on the roof.
It was like the first time,

1425
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:23,520
like we ate outside food.
Like I haven't had a soda in years.

1426
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,280
So everybody was like,
get down home.

1427
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:27,090
He was like,
oh,

1428
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,860
it was cool.
Wow,

1429
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,890
that's fucking cool.
There's something cool about

1430
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:35,910
appreciating something that you,
you just take for granted because you

1431
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:39,030
can get it anytime you want,
but when you're so restricted you get

1432
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,560
those things.
And it's so good.

1433
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,321
Yeah,
no dude,

1434
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,290
they loved it.
They loved it.

1435
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,070
And it was cool because like a lot of.
I mean dude,

1436
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:47,940
I made friends.

1437
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,990
Like there's guys I still talk to,
there's like friends.

1438
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:54,120
And it was yeah,
it was awesome.

1439
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,670
Like how can I say that?
How was prison?

1440
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,590
Awesome.
But it was like when people say that

1441
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,160
about war to men,
you know,

1442
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,960
people say that about,
I think human beings need a certain

1443
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:07,950
amount of struggle.
And then when you experienced that

1444
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:11,160
struggle than the non struggle feel so
much better.

1445
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,201
You know,
there's,

1446
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:14,100
there's moments where I've talked about
this before,

1447
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:16,100
but I,
when I'm hike,

1448
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:19,230
oh,
and I'm hunting in Alaska on this

1449
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,970
island,
Prince of Wales,

1450
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,850
and it rained every day.
We were there for six days.

1451
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,710
Pouring rain,
drenched her hunting.

1452
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,250
Yeah.
It was the worst,

1453
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,870
like as far as like getting wet and just
being soaked and cold all the time.

1454
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,840
One of the worst experiences you could
ever go through because you're just,

1455
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,940
it's always like 45,
50 degrees pouring rain and you know,

1456
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:44,070
you're sleeping bags with the inside of
your tents.

1457
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:44,940
Wet.
Everything's wet.

1458
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,290
But when I came back,
I remember it was sunny out and I called

1459
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,760
my friend Steve Rinella who,
uh,

1460
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,570
took me with him on this trip I go to.
I've never been happier in my life.

1461
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,780
Like the sun is shining like what I
normally just totally take for granted.

1462
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,740
Exactly.
I was like,

1463
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:00,540
it's amazing.
I love it.

1464
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,770
I'm like,
I'm driving on the street.

1465
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:03,900
Um,
so I don't think I've ever been happier,

1466
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,830
but I was that happy because I had gone
through the struggle,

1467
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:10,170
but nobody wants to do that on their
own,

1468
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:12,240
you know,
and when you're kind of forced into a

1469
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,190
situation I would imagine like being in
prison.

1470
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,290
Then when you get that Kentucky Fried
Chicken and you get that soda,

1471
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,220
you're like,
wow,

1472
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,510
we're,
we're fucking live in it

1473
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,940
now.
Yeah,

1474
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:22,210
because I,
I,

1475
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,210
I came from a place,
they have this thing,

1476
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,420
it's called a fuck.
I forgot what it's called,

1477
01:05:27,421 --> 01:05:31,620
but you have money in your books.
Everybody has money and they do like a

1478
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:36,480
sell off or they'll go to the local vons
by the prison and they'll buy.

1479
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,940
You can buy sodas,
cookies and pizza.

1480
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,070
But nobody ever had Kentucky Fried
Chicken in that bitch.

1481
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,700
Like to this day,
that's like my,

1482
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:49,000
I want to put that in my,
in my,

1483
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:54,170
like my bio Hack Kentucky Fried Chicken
in prison in Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1484
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:57,540
I don't know what they do,
but that is some special food.

1485
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:01,380
They just know how to do it.
Those fucking crepes.

1486
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,950
Kentucky Fried Chicken with Ellie.
You could take a hot sauce.

1487
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,800
It's cold.
Especially God damn.

1488
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:08,430
It's not.
No,

1489
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,200
it's not good for you folks.
I don't eat a lot,

1490
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,380
but it's a bad habit.
Guilty pleasure.

1491
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,690
It's so good.
You know what's crazy,

1492
01:06:15,691 --> 01:06:20,430
joe is like,
I'd be scared to go hunting trip out.

1493
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:23,100
Like I don't know.
I'd be scared like,

1494
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:24,900
I dunno,
like I will look at like if I was going

1495
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:26,250
to shoot a deer,
I don't know why,

1496
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,390
but we from full,
like I don't,

1497
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,100
I wouldn't fucking know how did you know
what I mean?

1498
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:32,960
Or like,
I dunno,

1499
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,230
it's crazy.
I trip out,

1500
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,940
my dad hunted and I was like,
Nah,

1501
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,110
I ain't doing that shit.
I'm scared.

1502
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,300
Scared of what the will we be scared?
I'm scared.

1503
01:06:39,301 --> 01:06:40,950
Like I'm going to like,
I don't know,

1504
01:06:40,951 --> 01:06:43,350
like I'm scared like the deer's fucker
with me and like there's like someone

1505
01:06:43,351 --> 01:06:46,040
else can come get me from over here.
Like I'm in their world.

1506
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,610
Right.
I don't know.

1507
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,370
It feels like

1508
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,050
their world.
That's the weirdest part about the

1509
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:51,660
woods.
When you're hunting in the woods,

1510
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,140
you lock eyes with an animal.
It's,

1511
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,710
it's,
it's almost like it's almost psychedelic

1512
01:06:56,711 --> 01:06:58,620
in some sort of a weird way like brings
you to another.

1513
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,610
It's like you feel like you're in
another dimension.

1514
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:02,620
It's.
I know that sounds so stupid when I say

1515
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:04,060
it,
even I hear it myself,

1516
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,550
but when you lock eyes and then when
you're hunting,

1517
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:10,300
you lock eyes an animal,
the whole world changes.

1518
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:13,210
It's like the whole thing.
You're in there and you're in a totally

1519
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:15,820
different environment.
An environment that doesn't give a fuck

1520
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:17,920
about you.
It doesn't care if you look like you're

1521
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:19,390
used to your street.
Oh,

1522
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:22,600
this is the deli that I eat at.
This is where I do my laundry,

1523
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:24,040
you know,
it's all normal stuff.

1524
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:28,990
Like you have these patterns and you
just see people and you see cars and

1525
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:31,660
like this is my world,
but then when you're in their world you

1526
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:32,560
realize like,
oh,

1527
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:35,800
this is a totally different world.
This is like I went to another planet.

1528
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,440
Yeah,
fuck yeah.

1529
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,480
I mean people try to get me to go
camping.

1530
01:07:39,481 --> 01:07:40,111
I'm like,
Nah,

1531
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:41,370
I'm cool it.
Oh Man,

1532
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:42,204
you'd love it.

1533
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:45,500
This thing about it is you get used to
it after awhile and it becomes normal

1534
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:48,470
and then once it becomes normal you
realize like how peaceful it is.

1535
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:51,370
Like we just sitting down in the grass
like,

1536
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,830
like on a top of a mountain,
like looking out at a valley and you go,

1537
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:57,680
God,
this is so like you would pay like fuck

1538
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,680
museums,
like go to the La County Museum of art

1539
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,780
and they see these bullshit exhibits.
They have their.

1540
01:08:02,781 --> 01:08:05,630
They're terrible to look at it.
Don't do a goddamn thing for you.

1541
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:09,590
Most of the modern abstract art,
it's fucking ridiculous stupid.

1542
01:08:09,591 --> 01:08:13,520
But I challenge anyone to go,
go to Colorado,

1543
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:16,160
go to boulder,
Colorado and at the mountains,

1544
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:18,260
go into the mountains and look at some
of those peaks.

1545
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,710
Look at the continental divide.
It's like the most incredible piece of

1546
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:26,020
art you could ever see and it's just
nature does something to you.

1547
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,090
You had me and red van just got back
from Denver and it was,

1548
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,100
it was cool.
Denver's the shit.

1549
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,190
I was first time there,
so I wasn't used to like,

1550
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,470
I guess somebody told me there's no
water around,

1551
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:38,240
so you get headaches.
Well,

1552
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:41,450
it's not that there's no water,
it's a year at a very high altitude and

1553
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,780
dehydration comes quicker for whatever
reason.

1554
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:47,870
So you have to keep yourself hydrated is
super important.

1555
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,910
I guess he's just dry out the
environment,

1556
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,640
but uh,
people are cool as fuck.

1557
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:56,300
And Denver is like one of the best.
It was always cool,

1558
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:00,020
but you know,
Denver for a long time the city of

1559
01:09:00,021 --> 01:09:02,630
Denver just didn't have weed laws.
They're like,

1560
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:04,010
forget it.
We don't give a fuck.

1561
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,550
You smoke weed,
do whatever you want to do.

1562
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,150
We don't care.
Like it was like when I first started

1563
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:10,010
working there,
which I don't even know when I first

1564
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:11,450
started working,
there was a long time ago,

1565
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,300
but I remember the club owners will tell
you like,

1566
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:16,730
this city is essentially made.

1567
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,590
We'd decriminalized like,
you don't,

1568
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:20,870
you won't get arrested for weed.
They just don't arrest people for weed.

1569
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,060
That's awesome.
That was a long time ago.

1570
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:26,510
Then the state was the first to get
gangster and say,

1571
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:29,150
fuck you federal government,
it's legal,

1572
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:31,400
so you could buy weed everywhere in
Denver.

1573
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:35,030
Now in Colorado there are weeds stores
everywhere now.

1574
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,820
So because of that,
the economy's booming.

1575
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:41,810
Real estate prices,
I think they went up 14 or 16 percent

1576
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:45,380
inside of two years.
Drunk driving deaths dropped to an all

1577
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,200
time low.
Violent crime dropped to an all time

1578
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:49,640
low.
It's amazing.

1579
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:52,070
Pills,
pill and opiod addiction dropped to an

1580
01:09:52,071 --> 01:09:53,460
all time low.
Yeah.

1581
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,800
Fuck those days.
Well,

1582
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:56,450
that's what's going on right now in
Arizona.

1583
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:57,560
I don't know if you've been paying
attention,

1584
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:59,240
but they're trying to pass it in
Arizona.

1585
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:03,590
They're trying to pass legal weed in
Arizona and the opposition has been

1586
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:05,660
alcohol companies and pain pills.

1587
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,050
Those are the ones who spend the most
money trying to keep weed illegal.

1588
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:14,910
My buddy grows like legally and he told
me that they invented this new light

1589
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:20,450
that makes sure we'd grow faster,
but all the tobacco companies got

1590
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:25,190
together and bought all those lights.
So every time this guy puts out new

1591
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:27,560
lights,
the tobacco company buys them all.

1592
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,330
Wow.
And I,

1593
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,160
I mean,
I haven't looked into it and then he

1594
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:33,020
goes,
the only other reason we can't make it

1595
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:37,640
legal here is because every time they
put the thc in the rolling things to

1596
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,230
mix,
like to put them in cigarettes,

1597
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:41,390
it gets too sticky and it misses the
machines up.

1598
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:43,400
And I was just like,
I never even thought of that.

1599
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,840
So just hire people to do it by hand.
Go to Gino La.

1600
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,610
That's why they have these tubes folks.
See people don't understand people that

1601
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:56,570
live in other barbaric parts of America,
whether it's hard to get weed,

1602
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,170
we get these joints and they're exactly
the same every time.

1603
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,970
Look at that.
It's God damn perfect.

1604
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,200
Got a little paper tube at the bottom.
We'd all sits in the top.

1605
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,540
The problem with this stuff is like you
said,

1606
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:10,520
this is medicine.
It's like medicine for life,

1607
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,680
but if you smoke it,
people think you're loser.

1608
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:17,330
That's me out.
Now they think that you're a druggie and

1609
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,200
you're a fool.
Something's wrong with.

1610
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:24,060
You fucked her
chart of Bullshit George for.

1611
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:29,370
You know what's weird is I have a 20
year old son and he smokes weed and I

1612
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:31,440
kind of feel like an asshole because I'm
like,

1613
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:33,900
you can't smoke that shit around me.
He's like,

1614
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:38,220
why?
And I said just cause like I just always

1615
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:40,980
want to feel like your dad,
like just give me.

1616
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,380
I gave that to my dad.
You got to let it go.

1617
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,300
I've got a 20 year old daughter.
She smokes weed.

1618
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,430
Wrong with it in front of you.

1619
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,910
And like not really,
but she's had wine in front of me once.

1620
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,590
Oh yeah.
But he wants me to roll it for him and

1621
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,260
it looks and I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

1622
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:57,000
I think I'd be a hypocrite if I said
there was,

1623
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:59,610
she's a smart girl,
she knows what the fuck is up,

1624
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,800
you know?
And when she was younger her mother

1625
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:03,360
caught her with it and there's like this
big deal.

1626
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:03,931
I'm like,
bitch,

1627
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:05,790
you smoke weed,
why you getting mad at her?

1628
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,430
But it's one of those things where you
feel like you're supposed to get mad at

1629
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:10,110
people I suppose to tell them.
I'm like,

1630
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:11,760
listen,
this is not bad for you,

1631
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,160
but there are drugs that are bad for
you,

1632
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:17,670
so if I told you that this is bad for
you and you realized it wasn't bad for

1633
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:18,610
you,
first of all,

1634
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:21,570
it would be a massive hypocrite because
I have tattooed on my body

1635
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,800
massive hypocrite and plus I knew she's
on Youtube.

1636
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,890
She's seen videos mean it's ridiculous.
I talk about weed all the time,

1637
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:33,000
but more importantly,
she wouldn't trust me about things that

1638
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:34,140
are bad for you.
I'd be like,

1639
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:39,141
stay the fuck away from that peanut
butter crank is actually bad for you.

1640
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,810
And I told her,
I said,

1641
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,990
we had a nice long discussion.
I said,

1642
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,850
I've never done anything that's
addictive other than alcohol and I don't

1643
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:51,510
have whatever genetic predisposition to
get addicted to alcohol,

1644
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:54,570
but I've never fuck with coke.
I've never fucked with crank.

1645
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:57,390
I've never fucked with heroin because I
don't want to ruin my life.

1646
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,850
I said,
but there are some drugs that they're

1647
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:01,620
fun.
As long as you're using them in

1648
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:03,750
moderation.
I don't think there's anything wrong

1649
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:06,090
with trying mushrooms.
If you do it in a safe setting,

1650
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,640
I don't think there's anything wrong
with smoking a little weed.

1651
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:12,210
I think there's plenty of things that
people would throw under the same

1652
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:16,500
classification as drugs that they're
just not bad for you,

1653
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:16,830
man.

1654
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,330
They're just not.
You know,

1655
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,680
you're right.
You're right.

1656
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,240
I just,
I dunno,

1657
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,120
I kinda like that little.
It's like a little Mexican thing.

1658
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:26,340
It's like the machismo illness.
Like my dad was like,

1659
01:13:26,341 --> 01:13:28,040
you don't do that shit in front of me.
Yeah.

1660
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,630
So I'm glad you told me that.
Hey Jordan,

1661
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,040
a blazer with you.
When I go home for Georgia,

1662
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,550
we're going to blaze it.
He's a man.

1663
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:37,050
He's 20 years old.
That's a man.

1664
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:38,160
You know.
My daughter is a woman.

1665
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:41,940
She's a woman.
Just as assistants thing,

1666
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:43,650
man,
when you're looking at life,

1667
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,990
you know we have classifications for
people,

1668
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,840
but when a person reaches a certain age,
like man,

1669
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,150
that is a.
that's a grown ass human being.

1670
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,370
That person could have babies of their
own.

1671
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:56,040
They could go to war,
they could start a family,

1672
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:58,560
they could start a business.
You know,

1673
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:01,710
it's,
I had a kid when I was 18.

1674
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,730
That's crazy,
man.

1675
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:03,780
Yeah.
He's 20 now.

1676
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:07,970
I could've easily.
We all could've.

1677
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,870
Right.
Anybody who's having sex could have

1678
01:14:09,871 --> 01:14:11,150
easily had a kid when they're,
you know,

1679
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:11,980
whatever age

1680
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,470
you started.
Most people they fuck up.

1681
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,290
They have sex with no condom.
They make mistakes.

1682
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,173
Yeah.
That was,

1683
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,210
that was some wild shit.
His mom was the wild one.

1684
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,830
She's the crazy one.
Crazy because you still keep in touch

1685
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:28,030
with her.
Uh,

1686
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,310
fuck.
I mean now.

1687
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,850
I mean he sees her once in a while,
but I have had custody of him ever since

1688
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:34,960
he was five years old.
He live with,

1689
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:36,910
you know,
he's lived with me ever since he was

1690
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:40,090
five because you want to do stand up.
He did for a little bit,

1691
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:42,570
but he is more like a,
I don't know,

1692
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:47,580
like he's more like both of my kids.
I wish I could have been them because

1693
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,270
they,
they weren't.

1694
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,600
I felt like I felt like I was a follower
when I was a teenager because I want it

1695
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:55,840
to be like a surfer skater,
but I also wanted to be a gangster

1696
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:56,950
there.

1697
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,530
Surfers,
skaters and their living life.

1698
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,870
Like they love it.
I love it,

1699
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,690
and my son lives by the beach.
He serves.

1700
01:15:02,691 --> 01:15:03,281
He's like,
oh,

1701
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:04,300
that's awesome.
Yeah,

1702
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:06,850
he works at in and out.
My other son does choir,

1703
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:08,830
like all the things I wanted to do.
They're doing,

1704
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:11,020
so that's what I'm just like.
Well,

1705
01:15:11,021 --> 01:15:14,410
you will honest and you talk about
things real honestly.

1706
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,970
And from that they can see like
mistakes.

1707
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,100
Oh yes.
And then not have to go through them

1708
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:24,520
themselves.
It's like I think parents that aren't

1709
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:28,030
honest about mistakes,
I think they do themselves a disservice

1710
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:31,450
the way they raise their kids because
your kid doesn't get to learn from your

1711
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:32,470
own fuck ups.
You know?

1712
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,970
I think kids need to know that you're
infallible or that you're not

1713
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:38,800
infallible,
that you make mistakes.

1714
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,330
You're just a human.
And that,

1715
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:45,550
I think I used to do this bit,
but it really does kind of apply is that

1716
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:48,460
when you were little,
like remember when you were little used

1717
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:51,850
to think that they were real grownups
because he used to like get upset about

1718
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:52,090
something.

1719
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,830
You go one day,
it wouldn't be a grownup and

1720
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:56,110
everything's going to make sense,
but it's never going to make sense.

1721
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,870
It's never going to make.
So I'm 49 years old.

1722
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:01,150
This doesn't make sense.
None of this makes sense to me.

1723
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,700
It doesn't make sense at all.
It's crazy.

1724
01:16:03,701 --> 01:16:06,880
It's the life to this day still so
bizarre.

1725
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:10,900
There's no grownups.
You just get older and then one day you

1726
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:12,580
realize like,
oh look,

1727
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:15,370
I just gotta find out how to be happy.
That's all you have to do.

1728
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:18,850
How to find out,
be happy and create comradery,

1729
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,930
like create comradery amongst your
friends and amongst your family and

1730
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:25,780
amongst the people that you love.
Spread as much as you can.

1731
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,090
Like that's what this is all about.
Straight up.

1732
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:31,840
Just try to enjoy it as much as you can.
Whatever this is,

1733
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:33,040
enjoy as much as you can.

1734
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:37,120
Everything else is a trap.
Everything else is a trap.

1735
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:40,960
All the other thoughts or traps,
collecting the most shit and having the

1736
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:45,670
biggest house and all that being the
most famous are selling most records or

1737
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:47,220
whatever the fuck you do.
You know,

1738
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,630
selling the middle of the most million
dollar houses.

1739
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:54,190
Almost all the bullshit has some people
just go out on missions.

1740
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,510
Man.
I got her brother like that.

1741
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,960
I love you,
but he's Terry.

1742
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,350
Like I think he made me how I am.
I got,

1743
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,920
I got five brothers.
All my older brothers are like teachers,

1744
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:09,100
like super successful.
Not that I'm not,

1745
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,100
but it's just like

1746
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,460
you can tell where it just turned with
me because my older brother,

1747
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:16,370
he was a captain of the football team
since like sixth grade.

1748
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:19,270
This was a captain,
played football.

1749
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:23,870
Marshall Fall gets his masters and he's
a trip.

1750
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:27,290
He was just so hard on,
like drill me all the time,

1751
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:29,270
dude.
He used to take me to the park and be

1752
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:29,690
like,
Hey,

1753
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:31,310
that guy kicks your ass.
I'm going to kick your ass.

1754
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:33,140
Go fight.
And I'd be like,

1755
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:36,650
what the fuck?
Am I crazy leadership?

1756
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,491
Oh yeah.
And,

1757
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:40,700
and he was like in leadership programs
and shit like that.

1758
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,560
And I did.
And look at me now I remember I told

1759
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:44,871
him,
I go,

1760
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:46,160
hey man,
you keep pushing,

1761
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:49,280
you keep pushing.
Your son is going to end up just like

1762
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:50,750
me,
like,

1763
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:53,480
chill,
chill.

1764
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:56,240
My brother was just like chet from weird
science.

1765
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:01,310
That's hilarious.
But shorter than me and just super

1766
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:03,920
educated in thug.
It was weird.

1767
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,950
Super educated and thug.
Yeah.

1768
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:10,310
Like he could kick all my friend's ass,
eh.

1769
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,050
Fuck.
It was really smart too.

1770
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,990
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1771
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,590
Did you ever get involved in martial
arts?

1772
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,570
Uh,
no.

1773
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,650
Probably should have done that.
That's probably would have been as

1774
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:24,210
calling.
He probably could have like maybe like

1775
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:27,160
alleviated some of that stress.
So that tension that he has,

1776
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,960
you know what?
It's weird as they hit,

1777
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:32,650
he coached his kids now and like he's so
different and like he,

1778
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,850
yeah,
I think he got his mellow.

1779
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:37,660
Yeah.
Well you had kids of his own.

1780
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:38,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1781
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:40,210
Beautiful little son.
Yeah.

1782
01:18:40,211 --> 01:18:43,060
But that'll do it.
He's so competitive to this day.

1783
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,710
Like I remember somebody was like,
Hey,

1784
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,260
I seen your comedy central roles bottle.
He was like,

1785
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:48,820
yeah,
but I graduated from Chapman.

1786
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,040
I was like,
fuck,

1787
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:55,160
can I have something that's hilarious.
He doesn't just want to say you did

1788
01:18:55,161 --> 01:18:56,200
great.
Yeah.

1789
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,600
It held time and like I did good on
something else.

1790
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,270
You know what I usually think I used to
think,

1791
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:03,780
oh well that guy just fuck those guys.
Those guys are pains in the ass is too

1792
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:07,680
hard to deal with them.
Then I realized what those guys are is

1793
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:11,250
like super winters that never found a
venue.

1794
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:16,200
Like sometimes there's super winters,
like there's certain people I really

1795
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:21,201
think in order to be a Michael Jordan or
anybody that's like a super winter,

1796
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,060
you,
you almost have to be imbalanced to the

1797
01:19:24,061 --> 01:19:27,060
point where you want to succeed.
You want it all about you way more than

1798
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:30,870
the average person and that creates a
lot of like relationship,

1799
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,540
like a,
like a,

1800
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:37,980
a block in the harmony because you're.
You're always thinking about yourself.

1801
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:41,880
Like I think a lot of those guys don't
find the venue.

1802
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:44,980
They don't find it a real thing to be
competitive with it,

1803
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,490
but if they did,
they would get all those lumps.

1804
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,680
Especially with martial arts,
especially with Jujitsu.

1805
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:53,550
Jujitsu is a big one man,
and if you can get through that,

1806
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,210
you get all those lumps,
you get choked down all the time.

1807
01:19:57,211 --> 01:20:00,450
You get your ass kicked all the time and
through getting your ass kicked all the

1808
01:20:00,451 --> 01:20:02,310
time,
getting strangled and tapped out.

1809
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,920
You,
you learn how to control your ego better

1810
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,100
and then you learn like what's actual
and what

1811
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,420
is.
You just talk and shit.

1812
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,720
Like how much of this is real?
You know what I mean?

1813
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,060
You're like,
yeah,

1814
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:20,061
because like had Jordan,
he was just soaring from college all the

1815
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,230
way up,
but you can't do that when you get your

1816
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:23,370
Jujitsu black belt,
right?

1817
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:24,390
You know,
you can still,

1818
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:25,380
you know,
you can compete.

1819
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,700
You,
you could certainly.

1820
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,680
I mean the guys who were the best in the
world,

1821
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:33,210
all of them are completely obsessed with
competing and training in Jujitsu,

1822
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:37,680
but I think just for men sometimes it's
good to have some sort of an avenue for

1823
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:40,170
aggressive behavior.
Just get it out of the way so you can

1824
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:42,070
chill out car raiders games.

1825
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,850
I really think that that's what a lot of
Douchey guys are missing in their life.

1826
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,290
They're missing that outlet.
I agree with you to the in some girls

1827
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,860
too.
Girls now are just a VC.

1828
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:58,590
I've seen more girls fight each other.
Then I've seen guys fight each other at

1829
01:20:58,591 --> 01:20:59,071
clubs.
Yeah.

1830
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:00,900
I go to youtube.
I don't go to clubs.

1831
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,210
I've watched that.
Tough from a distance,

1832
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:04,920
but yeah,
girls beat the fuck out of each other.

1833
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:07,800
Now that they've seen all these mma
girls who know how to beat the fuck out

1834
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:09,720
of each other.
We Ronda Rousey.

1835
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,550
Well first.
Gina Carano and Cris Cyborg though.

1836
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:15,690
Those were the first ones.
Like Gina Carano was the first female

1837
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:19,200
superstar,
but it never got as big as it is with

1838
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:21,510
the UFC.
Like when Ronda Rousey became the first

1839
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:26,040
female superstar mixed martial artist,
he became the first woman where dudes

1840
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,970
how to look at each other and go,
do you think she can kick your ass guys?

1841
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:29,910
But like,
fuck no.

1842
01:21:29,911 --> 01:21:31,320
And the other guy be like,
fuck yes.

1843
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:32,160
She'd kick your ass.
No,

1844
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,490
she wouldn't bro.
No yet.

1845
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,721
No,
no,

1846
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:34,500
no,
no guy.

1847
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,330
She would kick your and they have these
conversations.

1848
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,220
That's like literally the first time
ever.

1849
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,600
Yeah.
So yeah,

1850
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,290
I've had them in,
in the fights or started becoming a

1851
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,570
fighter because of her probably a giant
number.

1852
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,820
Fuck yeah.
You know,

1853
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:49,890
I,
I would love to see like a

1854
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:53,940
Chola come out of prison and get into
that shit,

1855
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:57,360
you know,
especially if she could get good.

1856
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:00,810
She had a good coach.
So much of it man.

1857
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:05,460
Yeah.
The coaching giant giant save you George

1858
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,960
Perez where young guy liked to fight and
uh,

1859
01:22:07,961 --> 01:22:10,770
you went to the wrong place and they
taught you bad things.

1860
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:13,440
They taught you.
They have poor habits.

1861
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:17,700
Their patterns like how they fight is
too predictable to know,

1862
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,610
have a well rounded game or you get
lucky.

1863
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,400
You could go to like for us a hobby and
Montreal.

1864
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,141
It,
a few guys,

1865
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:28,200
a handful of guys that are like the best
guys in the world and you meet them and

1866
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:29,280
you realize like,
oh shit,

1867
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:32,250
I got really lucky.
I found someone with like this deep

1868
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:37,251
reservoir of martial arts knowledge,
but there's only like 20 or 30 of those

1869
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:42,240
guys on the planet earth.
There's such a small number of really

1870
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:45,660
good mixed martial arts in particular
instructors this other.

1871
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:50,360
There's a bunch of really good a
traditional martial arts instructors

1872
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,680
like Jujitsu instructors,
a ton of really good ones,

1873
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:56,640
a ton a taekwondo,
same a lot for Moitai,

1874
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:01,290
but as far as like mma,
just the full like what martial arts

1875
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:05,380
really are today is the whole thing.
It's so hard to separate.

1876
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:06,310
It's good to separate

1877
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:10,530
in terms of like understanding who's the
best at each individual skill,

1878
01:23:10,531 --> 01:23:13,450
like who's the best Jujitsu guy on the
planet is not necessarily who the best

1879
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:17,020
mma fighter on the planet is.
There's a difference and if the best MMA

1880
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:21,280
fighter on the planet competed in
Jujitsu against the best Jujitsu guys,

1881
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:24,370
they'd probably lose,
and if the best Jujitsu guy competed

1882
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:27,850
against the MMA fighter in mma,
they would most likely lose.

1883
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:30,520
So it's.
It's a real balance.

1884
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:31,860
You got to get as more right?
Yeah.

1885
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:33,730
It's,
it's a balance and put that balance

1886
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:35,350
together.
There's a handful of people on the

1887
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:36,870
planet.
Fun.

1888
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,110
Yeah.
It's a.

1889
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,910
So if you know,
a young guy,

1890
01:23:40,911 --> 01:23:45,220
I wanted to become a martial artists,
like it's so important to find a good

1891
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,420
school.
It's everything.

1892
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:48,460
It's everything.
You could find someone who's a

1893
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:50,950
knucklehead that just likes teaching,
you know,

1894
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:52,680
they like hearing their own voice and
they,

1895
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:53,170
they,
you know,

1896
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:56,290
they have their own system and they act
like an asshole and act like a tough

1897
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:57,124
guy.

1898
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,780
You could run into one of those,
like we played a video in here a couple

1899
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,570
of weeks back of this,
I guess it was from the eighties,

1900
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,660
says karate instructor.
They took this homeless guy off the

1901
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:10,630
street and they,
they beat the fuck out of him on this

1902
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:11,920
video.
Stuff.

1903
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,070
Stomp his head while it's on the ground
is hard whore,

1904
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:18,850
super hard to watch.
But if you're a kid you could stumble

1905
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:21,430
into that guys,
Jim or you can stumble into AMC.

1906
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,560
Pankration in Washington state with Matt
Hume.

1907
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:27,490
It's like one of those small handful of
guys to the best in the world.

1908
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,570
You can get lucky or you could fuck up
like comedies like that to hell yeah.

1909
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,580
Hell yeah.
Fuck yeah.

1910
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:35,650
I've had a break.
So many bad habits.

1911
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,700
Yeah.
Well if you start off in the wrong spot

1912
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,980
around the wrong people,
you think that's what comedy is,

1913
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,210
where you can get lucky.

1914
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:46,330
You know,
you can get lucky and be in New York

1915
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:46,930
City,
you know,

1916
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:48,610
you can be lucky and be,
you know,

1917
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:52,510
at the saddler and stand and walk around
seeing all these comics.

1918
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:57,511
Just Bang it out and constantly writing
and developing new material or you could

1919
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,920
fuck up and you can be born and you
know,

1920
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:02,530
some weird midwest state that doesn't
have a comedy scene.

1921
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,170
You got to figure out how to fucking get
on stage somewhere.

1922
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:08,170
Yeah.
Fuck that man.

1923
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:10,540
If you're stuck somewhere that doesn't
have a comedy scene,

1924
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,840
you want to try comedy moving is fucking
hard,

1925
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:14,890
man.
Yeah.

1926
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:16,510
Dude,
I live in Orange County and people are

1927
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:17,344
like,
hey,

1928
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:18,490
why don't you go into Hollywood?
I'm like,

1929
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:19,600
dude,
I still like,

1930
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:22,150
I'm close to you.
Like I don't have to be there,

1931
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:27,130
but so happy that I'm fucking from
Orange County because I can go to

1932
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:28,840
Ontario,
San Diego,

1933
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:31,480
all these other clubs that will take you
guys three hours.

1934
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,690
The only takes me an hour.
Yeah.

1935
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,890
So fuck yeah,
I got lucky.

1936
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:42,010
Well this whole area is a great book.
Contrary to what people would think is a

1937
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:45,700
great place to start.
And there's also because the comedy

1938
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:50,610
store has so many comics that went from
being like door people to being

1939
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:53,590
headliners.
Like everybody who's a comic at the

1940
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:55,680
comedy store is a comic,
you know,

1941
01:25:55,790 --> 01:26:00,040
there's like a group of all of us and
we're all in the mix together from the

1942
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:03,590
guys who are still.
I mean I had one of the door guys on the

1943
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:04,130
podcast

1944
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,360
before.
I think that when,

1945
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,990
when you do stand up comedy,
you do stand up comedy,

1946
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,680
you know,
and I think that anything else like

1947
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,280
looking at it in any other way is a,
is kind of,

1948
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,193
it's,
it's,

1949
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,550
it's kind of short sighted.
You know,

1950
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:21,920
we're all in this weird thing together
in some weird way.

1951
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,090
I hear you.
Like when I first started,

1952
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:26,790
I didn't even,
it was forbidden to go to the store,

1953
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:29,610
like felt like I was told,
oh did they don't take Mexicans there?

1954
01:26:29,611 --> 01:26:30,180
And I was like,
Oh,

1955
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:32,270
who told you that?
I remember like,

1956
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,070
what year was this?
It's like 2000 to 2001.

1957
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,380
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

1958
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:37,214
no,
I was like.

1959
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:39,820
And then like somebody making shit up.
Yeah.

1960
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:42,720
Then I meet like Luke Torres and Johnny
Sanchez and they're like,

1961
01:26:42,721 --> 01:26:44,340
hey,
we gotta start at the time I was like,

1962
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:44,980
ah,
fuck,

1963
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,510
fuck yeah,
lucky to be there now.

1964
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:51,090
I love that place.
It's a learning so much.

1965
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,940
And like it's a trip because like
somebody told me that it's,

1966
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,190
it's the place for the zoo and I was
just like,

1967
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,680
that's exactly what I am look at being
like no other,

1968
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,470
no other clubs going to look at me and
be like,

1969
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:03,060
we want you to be the MC.

1970
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:06,240
Well I remember I saw you a first time.
I saw you there a while back.

1971
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:08,600
You were doing a roast battle and the
first thing I sent,

1972
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:10,230
it's like,
this dude looks different than these

1973
01:27:10,231 --> 01:27:14,400
other people.
Dangerous about this guy,

1974
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:18,330
like I've been around enough dangerous
people were like dangerous people almost

1975
01:27:18,331 --> 01:27:21,570
have like a smell to them.
Like don't,

1976
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:23,310
don't,
don't get stupid,

1977
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:27,750
you know,
some people that I don't think they

1978
01:27:27,751 --> 01:27:30,450
smell that I don't think that like I can
meet someone,

1979
01:27:30,451 --> 01:27:34,770
I swear to God and if it's a guy who's
been through a lot of shit you can tell

1980
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:36,920
pretty quickly and it talking to them
like that.

1981
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:40,980
They've legitimately seen a lot of
character testing shit.

1982
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:44,240
Like getting involved in prison riots
are beating the fuck out of a guy and

1983
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,110
break his orbital bone or a basketball
game.

1984
01:27:46,111 --> 01:27:48,840
How these people,
people that have done shit like that,

1985
01:27:48,841 --> 01:27:52,260
they have like a field to them.
It's interesting because I saw you doing

1986
01:27:52,261 --> 01:27:53,011
your Rosebud.
First of all,

1987
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:58,011
you were very funny things like sharp,
funny well-worded insults,

1988
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,900
which is like what [inaudible] is all
about.

1989
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:02,930
It's really what they've done is created
a,

1990
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,390
an amazing,
um,

1991
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:07,360
sort of a writer's show.
Yeah.

1992
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:11,370
Really about performing and coming up
with good ideas and good jokes.

1993
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:16,370
And it's cool because it gives a guy
like me a chance to go against people

1994
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:20,300
that I will never meet or ever hang out
with and like dude,

1995
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:24,800
like they get to be in front of you raw.
It's like all these guys that get to see

1996
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,080
them instead of seeing them at a coffee
shop.

1997
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1998
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:31,070
I liked that show.
It's amazing.

1999
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,680
It's a great show.
It's fucking funny as hell too,

2000
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:34,940
man,
you know.

2001
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:39,440
But so I remember seeing you there and
then hearing your story and I was like

2002
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:41,090
God damn,
that's crazy story.

2003
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:44,860
Like you have so much stuff that you
could mine into to it.

2004
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:45,510
It's like

2005
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,970
the fucking,
it gets even crazier because like,

2006
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:51,120
you know,
nobody ever asked me like this is the

2007
01:28:51,121 --> 01:28:54,540
crazy shit joe is.
Prison was a fucking piece of cake.

2008
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:59,460
The hardest shit was coming home.
And like it's Kinda like you go away for

2009
01:28:59,461 --> 01:29:01,470
a war.
Like I remember coming home like

2010
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:07,200
I was the neat freak forever.
And like I try to treat everybody in my

2011
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:08,310
house.
Like there are inmates,

2012
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:13,440
hey who the fuck left hair?
Kids are like,

2013
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:17,670
Dad,
my bath and oh yeah,

2014
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:20,400
like I couldn't be around people too
close.

2015
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,620
Like wow,
if I went to the store,

2016
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,750
like I looked at,
night is a Homie,

2017
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:27,210
I'm paying you here,
and then people are like fuck is wrong

2018
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:30,230
with this guy.
I would never text nobody at all.

2019
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,360
Nobody would answer my call.
And then what the fuck is.

2020
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,690
No one's answering my call.
He wants to answer calls anymore.

2021
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,280
Yeah,
it's strange,

2022
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:41,190
right?
A lot of weird shit about getting out.

2023
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:44,130
It was the fucking transition of
transitions.

2024
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,040
And so you were institutionalized.
Institutionalized.

2025
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,690
Yeah.
Straight up.

2026
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,670
And they were only in there for three
years,

2027
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:52,220
man.
Imagine if you were in there for 20,

2028
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,020
25.
Fuck.

2029
01:29:55,170 --> 01:30:00,170
Well it's Kinda like how you say it,
it's who you affiliate yourself with and

2030
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:04,230
then you know when you come from your
street,

2031
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:07,530
there's codes that just,
you're taught from the beginning of

2032
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:12,210
they're going to follow you in there.
So it's Kinda like I was taught by the

2033
01:30:12,211 --> 01:30:16,530
right people in the codes to go in there
and just to come out and to finally

2034
01:30:16,531 --> 01:30:17,251
realized like,
Hey,

2035
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:19,950
I'm not even going to gang bang no more.
I don't even give a fuck.

2036
01:30:19,951 --> 01:30:21,870
You can call me what you want to call
me.

2037
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,850
I'm living life now for my kids and then
for me and then I need this new

2038
01:30:26,851 --> 01:30:27,420
generation.

2039
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:31,010
You know what I'm saying?
Like that was the whole weird transition

2040
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:34,470
as well as just like being on parole.
Fuck.

2041
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:37,050
That was embarrassing.
Dissolve.

2042
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,780
Is there a feeling like hoping that you
could pull it off?

2043
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:41,330
Like when you,
when you.

2044
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,260
I would imagine that something like
parole,

2045
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:47,640
one of the big issues would be that if
you know that someone's watching you and

2046
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:50,310
checking up on you all the time and
evaluating you all the time,

2047
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,490
that puts almost additional pressure on
you to fuck up.

2048
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:57,500
There's like a psychological thing that
happens to people when you,

2049
01:30:57,501 --> 01:31:00,660
you know what you were talking about,
your brother putting all that pressure

2050
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:03,270
on you and then you respond from it.
Like there's a,

2051
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,390
there's a pressure that you put on
someone when you're monitoring their

2052
01:31:06,391 --> 01:31:08,220
behavior and I understand that you have
to do it,

2053
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:11,860
especially if someone's committed
violent crimes and you gotta make sure

2054
01:31:11,861 --> 01:31:13,740
that they're doing all right and not do
anything stupid.

2055
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,390
You let them free.
Right.

2056
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:18,630
I can understand it,
but I'm just saying that psychologically

2057
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:21,270
it probably has an adverse effect on the
person.

2058
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,600
Like that's gotTa fuck with your head
man.

2059
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:24,730
Fuck yeah,
it,

2060
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,500
it,
it's shit.

2061
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,410
You know,
it would feel like to have to check in

2062
01:31:28,411 --> 01:31:32,490
with so fuck.
It sucks because it's kind of like

2063
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,700
imagine having a girlfriend that can
just be like,

2064
01:31:34,701 --> 01:31:35,521
no,
fuck you bitch.

2065
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:37,080
You're going to prison.
Oh man,

2066
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:40,200
that's exactly what it is.
It's like you have to like why didn't

2067
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:41,550
you answer my call?
And I was like,

2068
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,860
I was on stage asshole.
My bad,

2069
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,750
I was working.
I can't answer it.

2070
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:46,290
And he was like,
oh,

2071
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,480
they have a power trip on you.
Yeah.

2072
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:51,420
They power trip and plus I was a high
risk in me.

2073
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,810
So your high control when you're on
parole,

2074
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:58,320
they,
they get you as a session.

2075
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,530
I'm a high risk inmate or normal parole,
no parole.

2076
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:05,650
All you do is check in once a month.
They don't come to your house.

2077
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:10,540
Maybe you piss test.
I have to go into that office once a

2078
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:11,380
week,
Piss test.

2079
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,390
Every time I go,
wow.

2080
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,240
And he comes to visit me with only an
hour notice.

2081
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,200
Only an hour notice.
Sometimes if you're lucky,

2082
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:23,500
sometimes just outside Christ.
That's so crazy,

2083
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:25,930
man.
And this is the crazy part is this guy

2084
01:32:25,931 --> 01:32:30,420
thought I was drug dealing because I
just got out of prison and I wasn't you

2085
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:33,310
on parole for three years.
So my first year I got out and I

2086
01:32:33,311 --> 01:32:36,670
couldn't work it out in my baby's mom.
She was different and I became a

2087
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:38,920
different person.
I wasn't that gangster that,

2088
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:40,210
you know what I mean?
I came out like,

2089
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,750
Nah.
So we just went our own ways.

2090
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:49,440
My buddy just got a divorce and he had a
bad ass house in Anaheim hills and he

2091
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:51,340
goes,
hey dog,

2092
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:53,410
like the bank's going to take the house.

2093
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,450
I think you have like a year.
You could stay in there.

2094
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:56,620
He was like,
I don't want to stay there.

2095
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:58,900
I hate that fucking house.
Me and my wife divorced,

2096
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:03,880
so I was staying at this house for free
and just paying the bills and my parole

2097
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:04,481
officers.
Like,

2098
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:09,481
how in the fuck,
how still he saw that you were dealing

2099
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:15,640
drugs?
Slang in a hilarious.

2100
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,270
And then like he was cool though because
like he uh,

2101
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:21,550
he finally like treating me like I was a
normal person.

2102
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:22,780
He confessed to me once,
he's like,

2103
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:24,040
man,
this is bullshit George.

2104
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,930
I mean he's like,
I'm getting a fucking divorce.

2105
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:29,620
He was getting divorced too and I guess
they were cutting all the parole

2106
01:33:29,621 --> 01:33:31,810
officers there are there.
We're doing a cut.

2107
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:34,540
So Cincinnati,
he had bad credit.

2108
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:38,320
He couldn't be a casino.
Wow.

2109
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:40,150
Bad credit.
Yeah.

2110
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:42,990
If you have bad credit,
you can't be a casino cup.

2111
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,060
I wonder why.
I wonder if they think that you're too

2112
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:49,090
desperate for money probably.
And then we might be able to accept

2113
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:51,730
bribes from people or something
properly.

2114
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:56,140
But that was the only time that guy ever
like talked to me besides just like.

2115
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,040
And it'd be like,
Hey,

2116
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:59,450
take a piss in front of me.
You know how weird that is?

2117
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,410
Real weird to look at your Dick,
right?

2118
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,990
The a rubber Dick.
No.

2119
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:07,190
For real people have been caught with
those visitors.

2120
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:11,110
Now what you do is you put bleach under
your finger now or the special thing

2121
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:13,990
that's like no advanced.
That's what Joey Diaz says.

2122
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:15,640
Yeah.
She said he put it.

2123
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:17,800
He put the clorox.
Yeah,

2124
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,900
under the forest.
Skin of his dick.

2125
01:34:19,901 --> 01:34:24,190
He was talking about it.
I one time he said he put Draino there

2126
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:25,024
too.

2127
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:31,210
I used to put coffee on my balls when I
went to court coffee.

2128
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,500
I put it in a plastic bag and a rubber
band and wrap it around my and go to

2129
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:37,180
court.
But he looked like a pimp.

2130
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:40,930
It's going to court everyone.
Urine like 50 people in a jail cell.

2131
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:42,670
Right?
And you're just right there and nothing

2132
01:34:42,671 --> 01:34:47,671
to do.
I want some coffee on me for real.

2133
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:51,920
It's like that.
And everyone was shooting it.

2134
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,480
And it's like when you're in there,
you want it to be just like this a man.

2135
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:59,930
There's no responsibility.
But just to be cool and be strong and

2136
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:01,400
fucking let's have fun.
Dog.

2137
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,030
Wow.
So you knew to keep coffee on your ball

2138
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:06,800
so you could have it once he'd be in
prison?

2139
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,690
No,
this is when I

2140
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,070
know that I'm already in prison,
but sometimes you've got to go to court.

2141
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:21,200
So I was going to court to get my
license back because you have the right

2142
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:23,690
to get your license back.
Even though you're in prison,

2143
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,070
you still have the right.
So they're like,

2144
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:25,581
all right,
fuck it.

2145
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:29,180
We'll send you.
So I tied it because knowing like Ada,

2146
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,680
there's not going to be no coffee for
us,

2147
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:32,840
but when I pull up to this and the home
is going to be like,

2148
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:36,050
because you don't get in trouble for
sneaking coffee.

2149
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:39,350
They'll just like a stupid ass talk shit
to you.

2150
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:41,390
But it was,
it was just like bragging,

2151
01:35:41,391 --> 01:35:42,740
having fun.
Right.

2152
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:44,360
Sorry.
That was weird.

2153
01:35:44,361 --> 01:35:45,710
Huh?
That's funny though.

2154
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:50,120
That's hilarious.
Thinking about balls and coffee together

2155
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:54,800
and no one's even like,
oh watch out is no one gives a phone

2156
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:55,910
even spoon,
spoon,

2157
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:00,040
spoon home.
There's hot water in the restroom at

2158
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:01,730
there.
We'd get it from the sink.

2159
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,880
Pretty Weird.
Strange.

2160
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:08,300
When you think about it or does it seem
like like normal.

2161
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:11,130
Does it feel like.
Because it seems to me like you're,

2162
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:14,780
you're obviously you moved past that
you're doing well as a standup comedian

2163
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:17,780
now you're out,
but when you're talking about it,

2164
01:36:17,781 --> 01:36:19,460
this part of you that,
you know,

2165
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:22,150
that kind of misses the fuck.
Yeah,

2166
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,630
you can see it.
It's like,

2167
01:36:23,631 --> 01:36:25,070
yeah,
but you don't want to go back.

2168
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,960
Never crazy,
isn't it?

2169
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:28,160
Yeah.
It's just like,

2170
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,050
I don't know man,
like it's Kinda like

2171
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,840
I was places with people for a long time
that like became family to me for that

2172
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:38,960
and like,
I dunno,

2173
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:41,840
I'm that Kinda guy that like a man when
I'm your friend,

2174
01:36:41,841 --> 01:36:44,480
I'm your friend and like they're still
my friends.

2175
01:36:44,481 --> 01:36:46,280
I'm like,
I know a lot of people.

2176
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:48,810
This is what I've been told by a lot of
people at.

2177
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:51,010
You're the only format that when he got
out,

2178
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:54,590
answered my fucking phone call and
didn't like people forget about you.

2179
01:36:54,591 --> 01:36:57,810
They don't want nothing to do with you.
It's happened to me where I've caught up

2180
01:36:57,811 --> 01:36:59,690
with La Homie.
That was just prison dog.

2181
01:36:59,691 --> 01:37:00,560
I was like,
Oh shit.

2182
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:02,360
My bad.
So yeah.

2183
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,370
Oh Wow.
So you get out of prison.

2184
01:37:04,371 --> 01:37:06,170
They don't want have nothing.
Oh yeah,

2185
01:37:06,171 --> 01:37:07,970
I could.
I could see people wanting to move on

2186
01:37:07,971 --> 01:37:09,500
with their lives to man.
I just think.

2187
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,160
But prison itself is so.
It's gotta be so devastating.

2188
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,070
It's so crazy how many people we have
locked up.

2189
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:19,470
When you look at the numbers are telling
you the truth.

2190
01:37:19,471 --> 01:37:23,330
I did not know.
Like now they got t bunks now like the.

2191
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:24,680
You don't even have day room.
No more.

2192
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:27,560
So you're in a prison.
This just say this is a prison right

2193
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:31,570
here.
Along the wall there it'd be cells and

2194
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,080
in the middle of where to be where you
eat.

2195
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:36,680
Now they have t bunks.
They have bunks that are screwed into

2196
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:41,660
the concrete and people sleep like with
no protection.

2197
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,580
Imagine that Shit.
Wow.

2198
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:48,110
You and 50 other inmates.
Just an a bunk in someone's big living

2199
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:49,950
room.
Yeah.

2200
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:54,950
It's getting overpopulated.
The numbers are so insane though.

2201
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:56,490
Yeah,
and it's crazy.

2202
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,960
I don't mean to cut you off,
but this is,

2203
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,310
this is what trips me out.
I was like,

2204
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:03,720
I had friends that I was locked up with
and like in Wasco reception,

2205
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,640
so people come in and out and my friends
are like,

2206
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,740
oh yeah,
everybody on this side,

2207
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:11,340
they get sent to Mississippi and then
they send all those like they're sending

2208
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:14,430
our inmates to Mississippi,
Alabama,

2209
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:19,431
Michigan and Michigan and never getting
a check from us and then at the end they

2210
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:24,240
bring us back and they send us home from
somewhere over here.

2211
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:27,270
Yeah.
There's never been a time in history

2212
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,840
where a country is locked up more with
citizens 10 right now.

2213
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,550
I can't imagine there's ever been a
time.

2214
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:34,470
I mean I'm saying that pretty
confidently,

2215
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:39,471
but I think they said that United States
has more prisoners than it was a giant

2216
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,110
number when they compared it to the rest
of the world.

2217
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:46,560
Like how many prisoners?
The will just look it up like the United

2218
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,310
States prisoners in comparison to
prisons combined the rest of the world

2219
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,470
because it's insane how many we have
locked up.

2220
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:55,980
We got more prisoners and illegal
immigrants in California,

2221
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:58,380
I'm sure.
I'm sure.

2222
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:59,570
Right?
Yeah,

2223
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:02,760
but what the fuck is the solution to
that?

2224
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:06,630
Like that's a broken society.
If you have a million people locked up

2225
01:39:06,631 --> 01:39:09,150
or whatever the hell we have locked up.
Don't we have something like a million?

2226
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:14,070
How many.
But like where does the funding come

2227
01:39:14,071 --> 01:39:14,970
from?
Is What trips me out?

2228
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:16,800
I was like,
how are they getting so much money off

2229
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:17,610
of it?
Well,

2230
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:19,320
there's a bunch of different ways.
First of all,

2231
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:22,440
it's a business.
Whenever a company is getting paid

2232
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:25,290
because people are in jail,
that's a business.

2233
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:29,220
Even if it's a state business or if it's
a private business,

2234
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:33,330
there's still businesses because they
cost money and they cost money and

2235
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:34,650
people get paid to work there.

2236
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,300
So as soon as people get paid to work
there,

2237
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,180
they want to keep those jobs.
That's always going to be a problem and

2238
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:42,210
people get paid to work in prisons.
They're going to keep those jobs also.

2239
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:46,200
They lobby the lobby hard.
The prison guard union lobby,

2240
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,560
cops lobby 2 million,
220,300 adults were incarcerated

2241
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,080
in 2013.
Wow.

2242
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:56,940
Holy Shit.
Additionally,

2243
01:39:56,941 --> 01:39:58,200
4 million,
750.

2244
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:03,201
One thousand 400 adults in 2013 were on
probation or parole.

2245
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:09,300
So that's a lot do.
That's one in every 51 people is on

2246
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:11,490
parole.
That is fucking crazy.

2247
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:14,670
That's crazy.
Now once you're on parole,

2248
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:18,930
like you stay in the system,
that is a crazy number,

2249
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:20,400
man.
That's.

2250
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,640
There's obviously too many things that
are illegal.

2251
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,470
There's a lot of people that want to do
these things.

2252
01:40:25,471 --> 01:40:28,320
We've got to figure out what's violent
crime,

2253
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:29,391
what's.
You know,

2254
01:40:29,391 --> 01:40:31,680
what's crime?
What's violent crime?

2255
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:33,110
What's what's,
what's.

2256
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:35,580
What does everybody agree?
Can't do camp kill people.

2257
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:39,650
Everybody agrees like certain Shit.
Figuring out what that is and now all

2258
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,330
that other shit you're locking people up
for.

2259
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,710
Stop.
Stop it.

2260
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:44,820
Well,
they get paid.

2261
01:40:44,821 --> 01:40:47,280
It's like you said,
like every public defender gets what?

2262
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:51,190
800 bucks for every time someone signs
for time and.

2263
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:55,820
But then there's also private prisons
was also prisons that get paid to the

2264
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,780
mean they are a business.
They start a prison so that they can

2265
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:01,390
make money by having people locked in
their cages.

2266
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:05,500
That's probably sub them out and do work
around the highway and stuff and make

2267
01:41:05,501 --> 01:41:06,430
money off of that.
Huh?

2268
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,880
Probably,
probably don't.

2269
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,510
I don't know,
but I would imagine if they made people

2270
01:41:10,511 --> 01:41:13,810
work in your prison and we've always
seen people working in prisons.

2271
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:16,450
I would.
I would always assume that that's a big

2272
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:17,110
part of it.

2273
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:20,620
And you could make boots you make every.
We make our own boots,

2274
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:25,240
our own clothes in there too because one
of my earliest jokes when I was like,

2275
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,910
it was probably a hack joke and I don't
even know it,

2276
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:32,950
but when I was a kid,
a live free or die was on the New

2277
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,500
Hampshire license plate and I was like,
imagine that.

2278
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,500
Live free or die.
What's fucked up about it as those

2279
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:43,560
plates are being made by prisoners so
they're in jail and they were right in

2280
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:48,631
live free or die on a plate.
Like what the fuck that was to be.

2281
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,640
Kill yourself.
Kill Yourself,

2282
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:54,610
kill yourself.
That was one of my earliest jokes.

2283
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:58,060
Probably one of 10 guys to come up with
it though,

2284
01:41:58,061 --> 01:42:01,360
because it's so obvious that you know,
that was always the big thing,

2285
01:42:01,361 --> 01:42:02,380
right?
License plates.

2286
01:42:02,381 --> 01:42:05,290
Yeah.
License plates and now it's everything.

2287
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,660
Frigerators might make refrigerators in
prison.

2288
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,640
It was always license plates.
So when we were kids,

2289
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:11,260
right.
That was always saying prisoners.

2290
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,850
Prisoners and license plates were
connected for some strange reason.

2291
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:16,630
I didn't like in Mississippi and down
south.

2292
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:17,770
They made the railroads,
didn't they?

2293
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,950
Probably.
Uh,

2294
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,840
I know they actually really did break
rocks in some places.

2295
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:25,440
They literally make gravel
sledgehammers.

2296
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:27,310
Oh,
that's a great workout.

2297
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,830
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2298
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,140
It's the best workout.
I used to swing a sledge when a

2299
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:33,840
deconstruction.
I was a form center.

2300
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:37,180
I had an eight pounder and 10 pounder
sometimes when we had rough dirt.

2301
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:39,910
Well,
they do that a lot with like mma

2302
01:42:39,911 --> 01:42:42,490
conditioning classes.
They have people hit sledge hammers on

2303
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:44,080
tires and shit.
What's this?

2304
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:47,790
Young Jamie?
Thirteen 11 products you might not know

2305
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:48,780
where made but prison.
Oh,

2306
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:50,560
books for the blind.
Lingerie.

2307
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:52,990
Oh Shit.
These dudes are making laundry Victoria

2308
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:56,840
secrets and JC penney hired
subcontractor.

2309
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:01,300
Third Generation who in turn hire people
stitch their laundry and leisure wear.

2310
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:05,080
How many of those dudes lik those
panties put them in those packages?

2311
01:43:05,081 --> 01:43:06,970
How many of them rubbed their ball sack
on him?

2312
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,940
That make come on,
but that's why women want them to

2313
01:43:09,941 --> 01:43:11,950
because they're like,
a convict made this.

2314
01:43:11,951 --> 01:43:12,880
Yeah,
that's the good.

2315
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,090
They smell it.
I smell danger and those panties park

2316
01:43:16,091 --> 01:43:18,220
benches and picnic tables.
Wow.

2317
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:20,980
Military Jackets in battle garb.
Wow.

2318
01:43:20,981 --> 01:43:24,490
That's an interesting one.
A federal prison industries,

2319
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:26,620
but this is nuts.
Better known as Unicor.

2320
01:43:26,621 --> 01:43:30,640
Consistent tiredly of convicts working
in 89 factories together.

2321
01:43:30,641 --> 01:43:33,640
They help clothe the United States
military making jackets,

2322
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:35,110
uniforms,
helmet shoes,

2323
01:43:35,111 --> 01:43:40,111
and even flak vests for police officers.
They craft body armor and holsters.

2324
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:41,920
You know what they're going to say in
the future?

2325
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,780
They're going to look back and they're
going to go,

2326
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,700
oh,
this is hilarious.

2327
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:49,780
Pop Point in history,
because the people then didn't know that

2328
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:52,180
they had slaves.
They didn't.

2329
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,410
They didn't think slavery existed.
They were like,

2330
01:43:54,411 --> 01:43:56,120
slavery doesn't exist anymore.
They didn't.

2331
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,930
But meanwhile that is exactly what
slavery is.

2332
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:03,620
Regardless of what they did.
If someone murdered someone and someone

2333
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:05,120
I can,
this is an argument that they should be

2334
01:44:05,121 --> 01:44:07,760
locked up,
but when they're working for thirty

2335
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,330
eight cents an hour because they
murdered somebody and they're making

2336
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:14,780
shit that people are buying their
slaves.

2337
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:16,670
Yes.
If just the government's buying it,

2338
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:18,500
that's a slave,
right?

2339
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:20,510
Fuck yeah.
I just thought of that right now.

2340
01:44:20,511 --> 01:44:21,201
I was like,
fuck,

2341
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:24,470
I feel as a slave for three years.
It's a slave.

2342
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,990
You know,
because people have always said slavery

2343
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:30,140
as barbaric.
If you didn't know our culture and you

2344
01:44:30,141 --> 01:44:32,840
know,
we accept this form of slavery as being

2345
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:37,280
punishment,
restitution and you didn't know that.

2346
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,820
Some people that are in there absolutely
don't deserve to be in there or were

2347
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:44,690
railroaded on fault trumped up charges.
That's there's a percentage,

2348
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,120
whether it's 100 or whatever the fuck it
is.

2349
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:51,590
That person's a real person in jail
right now and they're working as a slave

2350
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:55,190
to make body armor that's thirty eight
cents an hour.

2351
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:59,150
Fuck you.
That slavery is slavery.

2352
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,310
Just figured out a way to make it.
Okay.

2353
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,160
I figured out a way to make it.
Okay,

2354
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:08,300
look at this.
Colorado correction industries overseas,

2355
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:12,110
approximately 60 inmate work programs.
Jailbirds at Fremont County jail,

2356
01:45:12,111 --> 01:45:13,670
for example,
build fiber,

2357
01:45:13,671 --> 01:45:17,720
glass sealed canoes.
They use scraps from the apprentice

2358
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:20,300
prisons,
furniture shop and sell the canoes for

2359
01:45:20,301 --> 01:45:24,230
around 1500 bucks.
Other Colorado programs help craft those

2360
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:26,900
ubiquitous college dormitory desks and
bookshelves.

2361
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:29,440
Wow.
They make blue jeans.

2362
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,460
Holy Shit.
A lot of jeans.

2363
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:35,440
People by the Eastern Oregon
Correctional Institute is home for a

2364
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:38,390
47,000 square foot facility.

2365
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,790
Prison,
blue jeans factory,

2366
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:47,090
getting plates a prisons.
Bluejean horses.

2367
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,990
What does horses?
They train wild mustangs.

2368
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:54,020
Prepping them for adoption.
That is hilarious.

2369
01:45:55,130 --> 01:46:00,130
We got to open up a prison horses.
They capture wild horses and train them

2370
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:04,940
for adoption.
Did you know that that's an issue in

2371
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:08,030
America right now?
I'm just just becoming aware of the

2372
01:46:08,031 --> 01:46:11,480
issue of wild horses.
There's a wild horse issue in America.

2373
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:16,650
I mean like they have gotten free and
they've gone feral and they're wild and

2374
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,620
apparently this tens of thousands of
them.

2375
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,900
What are they attacking?
Anything.

2376
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,030
Oh,
that's hacking.

2377
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,900
Anything that out of danger.
It's just they're.

2378
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:28,190
They're encroaching on farmland and
they're becoming a new.

2379
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:32,240
We'll look at one point in time.
Horses roamed wild on the planes.

2380
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:33,980
That was a long time ago,
long,

2381
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:34,814
long,
long time ago.

2382
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:38,180
Then they actually went extinct in North
America and they were brought here from

2383
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:41,510
other parts of the world where the rigid
originated in North America,

2384
01:46:41,511 --> 01:46:45,110
but they brought them other places so
there was a point in time somewhere in

2385
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:47,420
history or horses did run wild around
here,

2386
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,740
but they killed a lot of them.

2387
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:52,500
They killed them and they used them.
They filled them with strychnine and fed

2388
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:55,770
them to wolves to kill off the wolf
population because they were trying to

2389
01:46:55,771 --> 01:47:00,420
make everything safe for cattle.
Raising that fucking crazy dude.

2390
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:05,310
Our country used to be this like kind of
wild area world is animals roam free,

2391
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:07,590
but when cattlemen moved across the
country,

2392
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:11,130
they started doing these wild horses.
You're showing US Jamie in Nevada,

2393
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:14,250
in Nevada.
Nevada has thousands of them apparently,

2394
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:17,130
but people see them there all the time.
I mean,

2395
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:19,470
it's a common occurrence.
I mean these are like,

2396
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:23,640
like deer or like anything else.
These are giant wild animals.

2397
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:28,110
So what's really fucking weird fuck is,
you know,

2398
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:32,340
people are talking about hunting these
things now because they're killing them.

2399
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,840
And there were,
there were doing it in the,

2400
01:47:33,841 --> 01:47:34,880
uh,
the,

2401
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:39,420
the early 19 hundreds.
They would kill them and make a dog food

2402
01:47:39,421 --> 01:47:43,290
out of them because they needed meat for
pets.

2403
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:47,100
Like people really didn't have pets.
Like there wasn't like a pet food

2404
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:49,710
industry the way there is today.
You know,

2405
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:52,200
people just fed their pet,
whatever the fuck they fed up,

2406
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:53,670
you know,
if you wanted a dog,

2407
01:47:53,671 --> 01:47:56,940
you feed him scraps or there was like a
big thing and a feed into your dog table

2408
01:47:56,941 --> 01:47:59,100
scraps.
But they started feeding them these

2409
01:47:59,101 --> 01:48:01,050
horses.
So they started killing all these horses

2410
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:05,970
and they would kill horses for dog food
and they would kill horses and feed them

2411
01:48:05,971 --> 01:48:07,770
to the wolves.
But for whatever reason,

2412
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,740
we didn't eat horses over here.
Yeah.

2413
01:48:10,741 --> 01:48:12,030
That's fucking crazy.
Like,

2414
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:15,630
so they were doing this in Denver or in
Nevada.

2415
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,950
That's in Nevada.
Those,

2416
01:48:16,951 --> 01:48:20,570
those wild horses right there in that
video is wandered around the debt,

2417
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,960
the high country desert,
I'm sure.

2418
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:23,430
Yeah,
because we have that problem with a

2419
01:48:23,431 --> 01:48:25,800
cats.
I fucking flip out if it was horses in

2420
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:27,390
the front of my fucking yard like that.

2421
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:29,580
Well,
if you live out there,

2422
01:48:29,581 --> 01:48:30,041
man,
it's.

2423
01:48:30,041 --> 01:48:31,110
It's possible.
I mean,

2424
01:48:31,111 --> 01:48:34,440
I don't know how many there are.
The real problem is not like there's too

2425
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:36,330
many horses.
The real problem is there's too many

2426
01:48:36,331 --> 01:48:39,810
horses that are going on with these
people's land that raised cattle and the

2427
01:48:39,811 --> 01:48:42,780
horses are grazing probably on the same
fields that cattle are and they're

2428
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:44,840
getting pissed off taking the grass.
Yeah,

2429
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:47,340
that's most likely what it is.
If I had to guess,

2430
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:50,310
it's just a bunch of greedy cattle guys
who don't know.

2431
01:48:50,311 --> 01:48:52,740
They don't want to lose greedy,
whatever.

2432
01:48:52,741 --> 01:48:55,680
They're trying to protect their industry
to protect their interest.

2433
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:58,290
I understand that,
but like at a certain point in time,

2434
01:48:58,291 --> 01:49:00,240
we have to step in I think as humans and
go,

2435
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:02,580
well,
is it a bad thing to have these horses?

2436
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:04,050
Like,
you know,

2437
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,270
what are they hurting?
They think they seem pretty cool.

2438
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:08,130
It's kind of cool to have wild horses,
isn't it?

2439
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:10,310
Can we all agree?
It's kind of bad.

2440
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:14,700
They seem to be thriving and you're
going to have to,

2441
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:18,030
they're going to have to figure out a
way to manage their population because,

2442
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:18,850
um,
they,

2443
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:21,510
they're not going to get jacked by too
many mountain lions.

2444
01:49:21,511 --> 01:49:25,650
The way a deer do.
There is a horse that big animal and

2445
01:49:25,651 --> 01:49:27,020
then they kick.
No.

2446
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,570
Yeah.
I mean I'm sure a mountain lion could

2447
01:49:28,571 --> 01:49:30,030
kill a horse.
Don't get me wrong,

2448
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:34,980
but I don't think that'd be a lot of fun
for the Mountain Lion Entirety Ensemble.

2449
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:38,100
Yeah.
Do you think they'd bike back each other

2450
01:49:38,101 --> 01:49:38,901
up?
I get the horse.

2451
01:49:38,901 --> 01:49:41,850
Would they,
would they do in Africa like,

2452
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:43,800
well,
like I'm that different hood to

2453
01:49:43,801 --> 01:49:48,000
different hoods,
but it is still cats and pray Predator

2454
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,210
carnivores and herbivores.
The buffaloes in Africa,

2455
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:55,990
they gang up and they go after lions.
Lions are attacking one of their own.

2456
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:57,820
Oh yeah.
It's wild to see.

2457
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:59,680
Right.
And I was little.

2458
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,920
My parents had a ranch in Mexico.
I used to have a horse.

2459
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:06,880
I love horses.
I didn't know how to tend to advice the

2460
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:09,220
right that fucker once in a while.
Did you know that?

2461
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:12,040
That.
Did you know the Aztecs or so tripped

2462
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:14,380
out by horses?
They used to cut their heads off to.

2463
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,610
Really?
Yeah.

2464
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:18,040
I learned because,
uh,

2465
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:22,060
that was the ritual.
They were offering a blood to the Sun

2466
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:22,893
God.
Well,

2467
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:26,650
so they would cut your head off and then
throw you down those steps.

2468
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:30,670
And then
Linda Cortez came.

2469
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:32,290
That's what they did to the people at
the end.

2470
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:35,380
And they did it to the horses will.
When Cortez came,

2471
01:50:35,381 --> 01:50:38,260
wasn't that the first time they had ever
seen a person on a horse and they

2472
01:50:38,261 --> 01:50:39,850
thought the person was a part of the
horse?

2473
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:40,960
Yes.
Yeah.

2474
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:44,420
It never ceases wise in that crazy
imagine that you,

2475
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:48,370
you've never seen someone ride a horse.
No one's ever written an animal.

2476
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,180
I've never seen a horse.
Then also these dudes showed up riding

2477
01:50:52,181 --> 01:50:55,720
animals on a boat with like jackets on
and shit.

2478
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:59,920
That would be like the,
you would be the biggest baller ever in

2479
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:02,590
the world.
He pulled up in a boat and you stepped

2480
01:51:02,591 --> 01:51:05,110
off the boat and a horse,
you know,

2481
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:06,310
you got a sword.
You're like,

2482
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:10,810
who fucking dude,
he imagined those days.

2483
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:15,010
Must have been so crazy.
You know what the crazy part is is they

2484
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:17,650
say that Cortez tripped out when he was
like,

2485
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:21,730
these fuckers have irrigation perfect
their sewers per.

2486
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:25,420
Everything's bill perfect,
but why are they cutting people's heads

2487
01:51:25,421 --> 01:51:27,850
off and throwing these guys down the
steps?

2488
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:30,160
Well,
if you look at the Mayan Pyramids and

2489
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:34,390
some of the Aztec architecture that they
developed in that part of the world,

2490
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:39,391
like they were on some crazy level that
very few civilizations have ever been on

2491
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:43,750
the Mayan temples all aligned
constellations or at least most of them

2492
01:51:43,751 --> 01:51:44,290
too.

2493
01:51:44,290 --> 01:51:47,340
So they had some sort of a deep
knowledge and understanding of the.

2494
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:50,770
What they were seeing in the solar
system is also a lot of evidence

2495
01:51:50,771 --> 01:51:53,230
apparently that they understood about
the wobble.

2496
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:57,940
Like the earth has a wobble called the
procession of equinoxes and this wobble.

2497
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,640
It still like the earth doesn't spin in
a perfect circle.

2498
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,290
There are standing,
you know,

2499
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:06,580
in this 26,000 year wobble and I think
it's 26,000 years,

2500
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:10,210
but the point is it doesn't spin
perfectly in the stars.

2501
01:52:10,211 --> 01:52:14,050
Change their position in the sky
depending upon where in that cycle you

2502
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:14,681
are.
Well,

2503
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:17,950
the Mayans knew that they had outlined
that.

2504
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:21,310
I mean they,
they developed some sort of a calendar

2505
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:25,060
that has accurate,
if not more accurate than the calendar

2506
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:26,660
we use today.
They had,

2507
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:29,710
they had figured out some crazy shit.
Yeah,

2508
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,110
I'm in prison.
I could.

2509
01:52:31,111 --> 01:52:33,430
That was like the thing you study,
like it was crazy.

2510
01:52:33,431 --> 01:52:36,700
I have a couple of tattoos of gods from
the Aztec.

2511
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:41,770
This is a certain God,
like they're all certain gods and yeah,

2512
01:52:41,810 --> 01:52:43,630
it's all in that calendar.
It's pretty crazy.

2513
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:46,070
Like I got the God on my of the day.
I was

2514
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,900
born on the.
Look what God is at Sochi socially.

2515
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:53,150
Both law.
It's weird because he was like,

2516
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,490
he's a weird looking at your nipple,
but I'm going to let go.

2517
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,420
Is that a prison one?
Yeah.

2518
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:00,770
Wow.
That's good work.

2519
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,930
Yeah.
This guy was solid right here.

2520
01:53:02,931 --> 01:53:04,550
He was with the business.
It's.

2521
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:05,384
I would,
you know,

2522
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:09,260
there's a few moments in history that I
would really love to go back and just be

2523
01:53:09,261 --> 01:53:12,890
like live in a,
in an invisible bulletproof bubble.

2524
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:16,130
I just be able to sit in the middle of a
time and just watch these people,

2525
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,160
but one of the big ones,
big ones.

2526
01:53:18,161 --> 01:53:21,440
I think if I had to choose one,
I think I'd have to take the Egyptian

2527
01:53:21,441 --> 01:53:24,680
pyramid two days.
Like I would love to see what the fuck

2528
01:53:24,681 --> 01:53:27,710
that looked like.
But right up there is I went to um,

2529
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,420
a cheech and Anita went to the,
the staff here.

2530
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:32,630
It's in,
um,

2531
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:34,880
like close to,
um,

2532
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,100
uh,
Ken Kuhn.

2533
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,260
It's like maybe an hour and a half
outside of Toronto.

2534
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,130
Okay.
Mexico,

2535
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:41,780
Mexico.
The Yucatan,

2536
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:42,351
right?
Yes.

2537
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:44,330
You done.
There's a couple of them down there.

2538
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:49,460
There's a couple of different sites that
have these Mayan ruins,

2539
01:53:49,461 --> 01:53:51,870
but we went to teach nita and you're
walking around,

2540
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:55,940
you're like,
what the fuck inspired them to do this?

2541
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,160
This is,
that was the pyramid that we went up and

2542
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:03,320
you got to realize we're talking more
than a thousand years ago.

2543
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:07,040
They built this fucking thing and why?
Why they do it?

2544
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:10,880
Like what is that they were really
infatuated by the sun.

2545
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:13,040
Yeah.
And they would always like,

2546
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:17,840
they felt when you gave the son blood
because they were so scared of dark,

2547
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:20,690
they always wanted light.
Look at that structure.

2548
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:22,130
Yeah,
I remember.

2549
01:54:22,131 --> 01:54:23,690
I remember going there and seeing that
and going,

2550
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,670
who the fuck are these people?

2551
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:30,320
Why they do this construction?
Every joint it's locked in.

2552
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:33,620
Like our construction nowadays can't
lock joins huddles.

2553
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:36,200
Joints are locked in.
Well they did an amazing job,

2554
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:38,600
that's for sure.
The engineering is impeccable because

2555
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:41,630
we're looking at it in perfect form
essentially except for a little bit

2556
01:54:41,631 --> 01:54:45,140
aware more than a thousand years later.
And it's just beautiful.

2557
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:46,900
Like when you,
when you look at the construction of it

2558
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:47,900
and you walk around,
you're like,

2559
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:51,620
this is some serious engine on and it's
on the highest site.

2560
01:54:51,621 --> 01:54:53,210
So no flooding.
Yeah.

2561
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,120
Like it's the way it faces the sun
there.

2562
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:59,720
Yeah.
They killed a lot of fucking people on

2563
01:54:59,721 --> 01:55:02,000
that thing right there.
That was where they would cut dudes

2564
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:03,170
fucking hearts out.
Yeah.

2565
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,870
Right on top of that guy.
They would do it right on top of.

2566
01:55:05,871 --> 01:55:08,180
Is he like,
he's like a little tray for human

2567
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:09,760
sacrifices.
He's actually,

2568
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:11,300
he's actually a god.

2569
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:14,180
They believed that he took those hearts
into the underworld.

2570
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,480
You should check it out at some pretty
bad drawings.

2571
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,030
Well,
I had a guide when I was there.

2572
01:55:20,210 --> 01:55:24,540
We hired this guy who was a professor at
a local university and he.

2573
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:28,370
He doubled as a god and he gives you a
historical lesson about the entire

2574
01:55:28,371 --> 01:55:29,930
place.
It was amazing,

2575
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:32,420
man.
It was amazing because this guy knew so

2576
01:55:32,421 --> 01:55:36,710
much about Mayan history and he also
said that they were really into eating

2577
01:55:36,711 --> 01:55:39,460
psychedelic plants.
He said that there was this place that

2578
01:55:39,461 --> 01:55:43,290
would go that had something had like
[inaudible] acid in it and they would,

2579
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:48,320
which is one of the elements in the LSD
apparently like what is a lsd stand for

2580
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:50,380
life surgery,
blah,

2581
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:53,100
blah blah,
but allergic acid is in there,

2582
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,820
but he was saying that they believed
that whatever they had was some sort of

2583
01:55:56,821 --> 01:56:01,470
a psychedelic lsd like compound and they
had this room and he took us to this

2584
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:03,340
room where they would do it in there.

2585
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:07,410
They had like a specific one of those in
one of the structures,

2586
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:10,650
this specific room where they would do
their psychedelic rituals.

2587
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:13,500
They were tripping their balls off.
That's how they saw that shit.

2588
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:18,750
They're cutting people's heads off.
And have you ever seen apocalypto the

2589
01:56:18,751 --> 01:56:20,250
little kids right there,
telling them mom,

2590
01:56:20,251 --> 01:56:21,720
hurry up.
And it's like,

2591
01:56:21,721 --> 01:56:26,721
what the fuck is going on?
That's a crazy time in the world.

2592
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,160
I would love to see that time.
Like when,

2593
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,390
when,
um,

2594
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,570
what's your other one?
You said Mayan.

2595
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:35,760
Then you said the Egyptian.
You said you wanted to go to another

2596
01:56:35,761 --> 01:56:38,180
place another time.
Gaviscon.

2597
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:40,380
Oh yeah.
You want to be around with that shit?

2598
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,240
I want to see that.
I want to see what the fuck that was

2599
01:56:42,241 --> 01:56:44,840
like because uh,
to take them on or to join.

2600
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:45,691
Oh No,
no,

2601
01:56:45,691 --> 01:56:46,560
no.
To Watch.

2602
01:56:46,561 --> 01:56:48,480
See how crazy life was back then.

2603
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,730
I wouldn't want to live.
I wouldn't want to live in any of those

2604
01:56:50,731 --> 01:56:51,750
times,
but I would want to,

2605
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:54,540
if I could have,
if someone does legitimately one day

2606
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,700
come up with a time machine and say it,
it's like,

2607
01:56:56,701 --> 01:56:57,690
dude,
it's 10 grand.

2608
01:56:57,691 --> 01:57:02,691
But you can go back to Egypt for like
our pal people would totally save up.

2609
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,110
I mean think about it costs a couple
thousand bucks if you're going to go to

2610
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:08,040
Hawaii,
right?

2611
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:10,980
Plane Fare and hotel room and then your
food,

2612
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:11,421
you know,
you're,

2613
01:57:11,421 --> 01:57:12,360
you're into it,
right?

2614
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:12,900
Yeah.
No,

2615
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,370
10 grand more.
For how long,

2616
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:19,080
how long are you in our one hour,
one hour and like this one hour in Egypt

2617
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:22,320
during like some sort of ceremony and
actually be there and get a chance to

2618
01:57:22,321 --> 01:57:24,320
see it when Moses was in the river.
And

2619
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:31,640
imagine what it would be like to see
those sacrifices that like when they

2620
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:32,940
built.

2621
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:35,670
What was it the pyramid of.
How do you say it too?

2622
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,140
To ICAN?
How do you say that?

2623
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:41,210
The Aztec pyramid.
See if he could find that that much shit

2624
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:46,220
done.
They killed 80,000 people inside of a

2625
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:51,690
few days and sacrifices not,
it's the religion.

2626
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:56,490
That belief and
there was nothing to do,

2627
01:57:56,491 --> 01:57:57,810
but yeah.
Fuck,

2628
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,790
I don't know.
Stop and think of that number.

2629
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:03,450
80,000 people and they,
I believe it was within a few days,

2630
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:06,570
I think they killed all the people that
worked on the pyramid.

2631
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:08,430
All the slaves that worked on the
pyramid,

2632
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,170
all of them got the knife I get.
They didn't want to pay.

2633
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:17,730
Social security
were the first ones are like,

2634
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:20,640
you fuckers getting work comp or
nothing.

2635
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:26,090
How insane is that time of life like
that humans had agreed to that,

2636
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,850
that that was going to be the.
That was,

2637
01:58:28,851 --> 01:58:29,684
that was the plan.

2638
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:32,220
We got these slaves.
We got into build this thing and then

2639
01:58:32,221 --> 01:58:33,480
we're going to cut their hearts out.
Right.

2640
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,381
We're cool with this.
Right?

2641
01:58:34,381 --> 01:58:35,330
Everybody's on board.
Yeah.

2642
01:58:35,331 --> 01:58:36,164
Yeah,
definitely.

2643
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:39,000
Let's cut their hearts out.
Like this is people.

2644
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:42,430
This is human beings.
This is a totally different time in the

2645
01:58:42,431 --> 01:58:45,520
world and really not that long ago.
Yeah,

2646
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:48,070
and it's kind of weird because it's like
they didn't even care.

2647
01:58:48,071 --> 01:58:51,970
Like if there was no more people left,
like how do they know there's not other

2648
01:58:51,971 --> 01:58:53,170
people left.
Right,

2649
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:55,910
right.
David will be the last people down

2650
01:58:56,150 --> 01:58:59,530
cutting 85,000 dudes or 80,000 dudes
hearts out.

2651
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:02,170
Imagine the guys I had to clean up all
that shit though.

2652
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,960
80,000 bodies.
Ooh,

2653
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:07,030
I bet they did a shitty job.
How about that?

2654
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:10,120
I bet they weren't very motivated to
fucking kill me too,

2655
01:59:10,121 --> 01:59:10,954
man.
Yeah,

2656
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:13,300
take your time.
Take your time.

2657
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,650
I mean,
how is the body cleaner?

2658
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,850
Well,
that was one of the things they said

2659
01:59:15,851 --> 01:59:19,060
about gangs con that when Genghis Kahn
died,

2660
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:24,010
they buried him and then they killed all
the people that buried him and then they

2661
01:59:24,011 --> 01:59:26,260
killed the people that killed the people
that buried him.

2662
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,710
Fuck,
that's a super

2663
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,370
gangsters.
It gets you kill everybody.

2664
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,470
Everybody that has any idea where he's
buried.

2665
01:59:35,471 --> 01:59:40,260
So no one could ever find the great con.
So only the guy that ordered the hit

2666
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:44,320
nosa even he doesn't know far.
Everybody's dead.

2667
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:46,270
The people that ordered,
they killed them too.

2668
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:48,640
They killed everybody.
So no one knows.

2669
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:52,000
No one knows where it is.
I just put a burn the body and acid and

2670
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:54,400
be like,
good call.

2671
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,650
No,
I think they have to have rituals.

2672
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:58,780
Like I think you know,
in order to you,

2673
01:59:58,781 --> 02:00:02,470
if you're a Mongol order to make it to
the next stage of life,

2674
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:03,420
you probably have.

2675
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:07,330
They probably have some crazy rituals.
You're going to come back with a

2676
02:00:07,331 --> 02:00:10,530
motorcycle,
but that point in history seems like it

2677
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:13,570
would be pretty insane.
They said the gang is con killed like 10

2678
02:00:13,571 --> 02:00:16,120
percent of the.
There was a New York Times article about

2679
02:00:16,121 --> 02:00:21,121
it that he killed 10 percent of the
world's population and he apparently

2680
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:25,990
changed the carbon footprint of the
human race.

2681
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:29,380
Meaning it killed so many fucking
people.

2682
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:34,060
There was less soot in the air.
There was less carbon because of fires.

2683
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:37,380
He's like,
it changed far away the foot.

2684
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:41,050
What are residue on earth is when they
do those core samples.

2685
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:44,860
That's saying,
man,

2686
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,510
you gotta.
If anybody listening to this,

2687
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:48,190
if you have it,
you've might have heard this before,

2688
02:00:48,191 --> 02:00:50,920
but I have to say it to people that
haven't hardcore history.

2689
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:53,590
There's a guy named Dan Carlin,
he was on last week.

2690
02:00:53,591 --> 02:00:57,520
He's fucking awesome.
He's the best ever at like doing history

2691
02:00:57,521 --> 02:00:59,350
podcast.
That guy's a monster.

2692
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:00,430
Him and Danielle.
Ebola.

2693
02:01:00,431 --> 02:01:02,740
He's awesome too,
but his,

2694
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:06,430
he's got a series on the Gig is con days
called the wrath of the con.

2695
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:09,180
It's a five part series.
You can get it on itunes.

2696
02:01:09,181 --> 02:01:12,340
It's like a dollar 99 a show or
something like that,

2697
02:01:12,341 --> 02:01:14,620
but there's hours and hours long folks
that are.

2698
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,240
I can't,
I can't run,

2699
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:19,570
it used to be free,
but he does like the first x amount of

2700
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:21,850
free and then because he only does,
I'm like,

2701
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:24,910
it takes months to put one of these out.
It's not like asking someone to pay for

2702
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:27,610
a regular podcast.
It's like an audio book.

2703
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:30,280
Okay.
Does he go out to all these places?

2704
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,420
I don't think so.
I mean,

2705
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:32,940
I don't know.
He studied,

2706
02:01:32,941 --> 02:01:34,690
uh,
the Mongols ever since he was in

2707
02:01:34,691 --> 02:01:35,930
college.
Who did a,

2708
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:38,710
wrote a report about it?
It was part of the,

2709
02:01:38,711 --> 02:01:40,390
um,
the uh,

2710
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:43,880
podcast series that he does on it.
He talks about his history with the

2711
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:47,480
history of the Mongols,
but it's amazing and that's what got me

2712
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:49,460
excited about the Mongols and starting
to check it out.

2713
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:54,461
But I just would love to see what crazy
points in time looked like.

2714
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:59,060
Like how as humans,
how we evolved with thinking and

2715
02:01:59,061 --> 02:02:00,430
fighting and shit like that.
Well,

2716
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:03,560
you mean there's levels of craziness in
this world right now,

2717
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:05,600
right?
Like somewhere there's some dudes that

2718
02:02:05,601 --> 02:02:08,000
are working as slaves making blue jeans
for some company,

2719
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:08,841
right?
I mean,

2720
02:02:08,841 --> 02:02:10,450
and they're prisoners.
There's,

2721
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:13,760
there's that world is a world that you
experience when you're in the county and

2722
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:16,520
a riot breaks out.
This world is very different than the

2723
02:02:16,521 --> 02:02:19,910
world that most people experience.
But our world itself,

2724
02:02:19,911 --> 02:02:21,890
like the,
all the variables that we know that are

2725
02:02:21,891 --> 02:02:24,590
possible,
whether it's prison or or war or all

2726
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:25,940
these things we know to be possible.

2727
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:29,960
They are very different than it was a
thousand years ago or 2000 or whatever.

2728
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:34,640
The Egypt was 4,500 plus years ago that
they were building the great pyramid.

2729
02:02:34,641 --> 02:02:38,270
Apparently fucking life would have been
crazy and insane.

2730
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,160
I mean,
I can't even imagine what they say.

2731
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:43,730
The Great Pyramid,
I think they said it's 2,500 BC when

2732
02:02:43,731 --> 02:02:46,760
they carbon tested to some of the stuff
in it,

2733
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:52,030
which is 4,000 plus years ago,
you'd have to like hold your head how

2734
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,860
you would hurt your head to think of how
long ago that was.

2735
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:59,420
Hundreds and hundreds of years and
people living and dying and change

2736
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:02,810
occurring and things in the climate
shifts and the,

2737
02:03:02,811 --> 02:03:03,471
uh,
you know,

2738
02:03:03,471 --> 02:03:05,710
the earthquakes,
feelings,

2739
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:09,560
man,
so much craziness and it's so long and

2740
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:13,670
if you go that far back,
these motherfuckers built some insane

2741
02:03:13,671 --> 02:03:17,990
shit that we can't barely built today.
We would have to have a team of

2742
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:22,100
engineers from all over the world,
the biggest cranes ever to try to put

2743
02:03:22,101 --> 02:03:24,150
together one of those in just a,
you know,

2744
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,480
in a decade or two decades.

2745
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:30,470
Imagine that like the machines wouldn't
even work in that climate.

2746
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:32,450
They wouldn't even know how to adjust to
the sand.

2747
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,030
They'd have to make better machines.
Mean it could be done.

2748
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:36,890
I think it can be done,
but it's not,

2749
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:41,360
it's not simple.
What they did was so spectacular and the

2750
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:44,870
idea that they did it 2,500 BC,
4,000,

2751
02:03:44,871 --> 02:03:47,330
500 plus years ago.
That's fucking crazy.

2752
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:50,150
Hard to imagine they did that shit
before Jesus.

2753
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:51,590
I would love to see it,
man.

2754
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,290
I would love to see it.
I would just love to see what it looked

2755
02:03:54,291 --> 02:03:57,770
like back then like what happened?
Like the first day there were done.

2756
02:03:57,771 --> 02:04:01,130
Imagine how that just what it would be
like to live in that era.

2757
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:02,740
Like what were their markets like,
what,

2758
02:04:02,741 --> 02:04:05,090
how smart were they?
Like I would love to be able to speak

2759
02:04:05,091 --> 02:04:08,540
their language and talked to one of them
from back then because I just think that

2760
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:12,500
someone who builds that they must have
been insanely smart.

2761
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,750
Insane.
But also.

2762
02:04:14,751 --> 02:04:17,660
I mean I agree with what you're saying,
but there were kind of like assholes

2763
02:04:17,661 --> 02:04:19,580
because they have slaves as well.
No,

2764
02:04:19,581 --> 02:04:22,640
that was a common misconception.
They thought that they had slaves until

2765
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:25,820
pretty recently,
but now they realized by the quality of

2766
02:04:25,821 --> 02:04:30,290
the food and the pottery that they had
in their shelters,

2767
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:35,330
that they were highly paid workers.
That's the new theory is to get someone

2768
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:39,630
to build something like that you to see.
The thing is it's so hard to know.

2769
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:41,190
You know,
they might've been slaves that were

2770
02:04:41,191 --> 02:04:44,070
taken care of really well.
It's so hard to know because it's so

2771
02:04:44,071 --> 02:04:47,310
long ago and they're basing it just on
pottery and bones,

2772
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:49,830
like the type of food that they ate.
They ate well,

2773
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:52,920
but you would have to eat well if you're
moving these giant stones to you.

2774
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:56,520
It would be within your best interest to
keep your slave super healthy.

2775
02:04:56,670 --> 02:05:00,600
They have to move stones all day and
it's funny because we just have a theory

2776
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:03,720
of how they did it with ropes.
They really do it.

2777
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,820
We don't know.
There's a bunch of different theories

2778
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:09,270
making ramps and stuff.
None of them are really very good

2779
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:14,870
because I think none of them address the
possibility that they had some kind of

2780
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:17,850
technology or understanding that we
don't have anymore.

2781
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:21,420
Whether it's some sort of a machine they
created or some sort of a lever system

2782
02:05:21,421 --> 02:05:23,870
they created.
It is entirely possible that like,

2783
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,620
look,
when you're talking about your time in

2784
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:29,820
prison or people making tattoo guns out
a wire and you know,

2785
02:05:29,970 --> 02:05:33,040
taking something from a broom and
sharpen it and sterilizing it and then

2786
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:36,660
making the suit and doing it for days
like that kind of ingenuity just in

2787
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:41,840
three years of prison.
Imagine 3000 plus years of people trying

2788
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:47,481
to get by and make do during this weird
time where there's no electricity,

2789
02:05:47,671 --> 02:05:49,790
there's no engines,
there's no they,

2790
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:54,440
they have the same kind of mind that you
have today that I have today that we're

2791
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:58,290
like modern people,
but they lived in this time where there

2792
02:05:58,291 --> 02:06:01,110
was no modern inventions and they
figured out how to make pyramids.

2793
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:07,660
I'll point and then I guess there's like
they say that the way that their son

2794
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:10,670
like hits a certain thing in there.

2795
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,600
Well some of them.
Yeah,

2796
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:14,640
but it depends on what time of year
again,

2797
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:16,440
because of that procession of the
equinoxes,

2798
02:06:16,441 --> 02:06:20,280
the way the earth wobbles,
it depends on what time of year depends

2799
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:23,670
on what year the cycle is.
You know,

2800
02:06:23,671 --> 02:06:27,940
like this procession of the equinox is
also points to the fact that that's

2801
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:31,830
finks at one point in time,
probably I think something like 10,000,

2802
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:33,810
500 years ago,
face the sun,

2803
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,300
the face,
the Constellation Leo.

2804
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:40,710
So there's a reason why the lion was
facing in that direction because they

2805
02:06:40,711 --> 02:06:42,620
had apparently the Zodiac
constellations.

2806
02:06:42,621 --> 02:06:45,390
Uh,
even like way as back as I'm the

2807
02:06:45,391 --> 02:06:48,270
Sumerians,
I think they had all the signs of the

2808
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:52,170
Zodiac way back then.
Like they had the fish and the lady with

2809
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:53,220
the skate,
the scales,

2810
02:06:53,221 --> 02:06:55,440
all that jazz.
I'm pretty sure they had those

2811
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:56,970
constellations way,
way,

2812
02:06:56,971 --> 02:06:58,200
way the fuck back then.

2813
02:06:58,720 --> 02:06:59,620
That's it.
Yeah.

2814
02:06:59,621 --> 02:07:00,454
Thank you.
Said

2815
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,400
I could barely put my tent up.

2816
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:06,561
That's not true,
man.

2817
02:07:06,561 --> 02:07:07,970
You were talking about,
you know,

2818
02:07:07,971 --> 02:07:10,700
living in prison data you would adapt
everywhere.

2819
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:11,180
Yeah.
But

2820
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:13,770
like see,
it's weird.

2821
02:07:13,771 --> 02:07:16,290
You made me understand something like
that's what I was kind of like to me I

2822
02:07:16,291 --> 02:07:19,290
felt like they were in prison to the
only reason I adapted to it because I

2823
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:22,110
had nothing else to do.
But what was there.

2824
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,600
Yeah.
So like they have like what's there.

2825
02:07:24,601 --> 02:07:27,600
But like now that like I have all this,
my friend told me this,

2826
02:07:27,601 --> 02:07:29,430
he goes,
sorry I talk,

2827
02:07:29,431 --> 02:07:30,720
we're going to jump in and out.
And he goes,

2828
02:07:30,721 --> 02:07:32,340
hey dog,
when you're in prison,

2829
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,980
you have nothing to do,
but you always want to

2830
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,170
do something but you can't because
you're confined.

2831
02:07:38,410 --> 02:07:42,000
But now that you're home,
don't sit at the fucking house called do

2832
02:07:42,010 --> 02:07:44,170
shit.
[inaudible] you been wanting to do

2833
02:07:44,171 --> 02:07:46,210
stuff.
But then I catch myself sitting at home

2834
02:07:46,211 --> 02:07:49,120
like
so used to this,

2835
02:07:49,121 --> 02:07:50,170
get out,
get out.

2836
02:07:50,171 --> 02:07:52,990
You're not going to get arrested.
The trap.

2837
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:57,400
So fuck yeah,
I can imagine that they were just like,

2838
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:59,950
there's nothing else to do.
Let's build a pyramid.

2839
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,470
And their world.
The world was a prison.

2840
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:07,360
I mean think of how barbaric the world
was 4,500 plus years ago.

2841
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:10,720
How barbaric was the world?
How was the weather?

2842
02:08:10,721 --> 02:08:11,710
We do,
we do.

2843
02:08:11,711 --> 02:08:16,711
We have proof of how the weather was.
They think that up until around 9,000 bc

2844
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:22,000
it was a tree.
Well from 9,000 BC rather back,

2845
02:08:22,150 --> 02:08:25,630
it was a tropical rain forest,
which is really interesting.

2846
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:30,610
They think that it resembled the same
rain forest you see in like the Amazon

2847
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,230
thing.

2848
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:34,900
It was beautiful rain forest,
but the climate shifted for whatever

2849
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:37,810
reason,
and that's one of the main arguments

2850
02:08:37,811 --> 02:08:41,860
that the sphinx is way older than people
think it is because it has all this

2851
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:44,230
water erosion all throughout the outside
of it.

2852
02:08:44,231 --> 02:08:48,160
It's a very hotly debated issue.
Like there's some archeologists that

2853
02:08:48,161 --> 02:08:51,880
refuse to believe it because that would
indicate that it was made somewhere,

2854
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:56,410
not just 9,000 bc but thousands of years
before that because it has like

2855
02:08:56,411 --> 02:09:00,760
thousands of years of water erosion on
it and they think that erosion is wind

2856
02:09:00,761 --> 02:09:03,650
and sand.
It's a real hotly debated subjects and

2857
02:09:03,651 --> 02:09:06,760
I'm not really smart enough or educated
enough to make a call either way,

2858
02:09:06,761 --> 02:09:10,600
but when I look at it and you listened
to geologists like this guy,

2859
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:15,250
Dr Robert Schoch from Boston University
kind of staked his reputation on it

2860
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:18,010
because he's received a lot of
criticism,

2861
02:09:18,011 --> 02:09:20,230
but he's like,
this is thousands of years of rainfall

2862
02:09:20,231 --> 02:09:21,970
that's made this a road like this.

2863
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,910
Which means,
which means they built that thing

2864
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:26,980
thousands of years.
Even before that,

2865
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:29,710
like we,
we want to think that the Egyptian

2866
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:34,711
civilization neatly arrived around 2,500
BC and there's no way it can be any

2867
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:37,660
earlier than that because you know,
people back then didn't know anything.

2868
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:39,160
Well,
how the fuck did they know how to do it?

2869
02:09:39,161 --> 02:09:41,920
Then?
That doesn't make any sense either.

2870
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:43,990
Like,
it doesn't make less sense that people

2871
02:09:43,991 --> 02:09:48,130
knew how to do it at 9,000 BC.
It's all crazy with whatever they did

2872
02:09:48,131 --> 02:09:49,150
was amazing.
Yeah.

2873
02:09:49,151 --> 02:09:52,630
They and they live like ballers.
They always gold if gold everywhere.

2874
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,330
You know what I mean?
Look at King Tut sarcophagus.

2875
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:01,660
Sarcophagus covered in fucking gold leaf
and shit.

2876
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:03,490
They were a great artist.
Oh yeah.

2877
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:08,050
Well they wrote in symbols.
They had these weird ways of writing

2878
02:10:08,370 --> 02:10:11,960
where they like images or symbols.
So you know,

2879
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:16,930
we look at a word like you look at the
look of the word sandwich and okay see

2880
02:10:16,931 --> 02:10:20,440
those letters laid out and they have an
image in your mind and that becomes your

2881
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:22,360
form of language.
That's your written language.

2882
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:26,770
But they had like this,
they had an image based language,

2883
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:30,550
so it's a very different way of thinking
like so did,

2884
02:10:30,551 --> 02:10:32,500
uh,
the Mayans had another one,

2885
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,100
image based kind

2886
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:38,210
of a language to those imaged based
languages are very bizarre because you

2887
02:10:38,211 --> 02:10:43,211
gotta realize like language and the way
it's used shapes the world and one of

2888
02:10:43,761 --> 02:10:48,761
the big problems that we're having as
comedians is the subtlety of the English

2889
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:53,990
language and the things that people can
and can't be offended by.

2890
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:58,250
So instead of conveying pure intent,
instead of anything you're saying,

2891
02:10:58,251 --> 02:11:03,251
conveying pure intent,
there's this giant variable of what you

2892
02:11:03,321 --> 02:11:05,300
can and can't say,
well you shouldn't,

2893
02:11:05,301 --> 02:11:07,190
shouldn't be able to say,
you know,

2894
02:11:07,191 --> 02:11:09,740
what is offensive to some people?
What is,

2895
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:10,643
you know,
what,

2896
02:11:10,730 --> 02:11:14,720
what you think is okay because you feel
this and you feel that there's so much

2897
02:11:14,721 --> 02:11:17,990
going on with the English language.
But you got to think that if your

2898
02:11:17,991 --> 02:11:22,991
language was based in images,
it would probably have a different feel

2899
02:11:23,271 --> 02:11:25,280
to it.
I would wonder what would that feel

2900
02:11:25,281 --> 02:11:26,114
would be like.

2901
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:27,980
That's interesting how you said that.
Yeah,

2902
02:11:27,981 --> 02:11:30,080
because we sound shit out over there.
It's like,

2903
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:31,130
no,
this is what it means.

2904
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:34,130
They must have obviously have a spoken
language.

2905
02:11:34,131 --> 02:11:37,160
That's really weird too.
I don't know what the Egyptian spoke.

2906
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:41,210
I want to say they probably spoke at the
fact that they speak.

2907
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:43,430
If you ask people like,
what did the Egyptian,

2908
02:11:43,431 --> 02:11:45,020
the ancient Egyptians speak,
you'd be like,

2909
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,370
oh,
I never thought of that.

2910
02:11:47,810 --> 02:11:49,490
Egypt would have to be.
Well,

2911
02:11:49,491 --> 02:11:53,360
apparently they had a gigantic library,
the library of Alexandria,

2912
02:11:53,361 --> 02:11:55,880
and it was burned a long,
long time ago.

2913
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,530
Coptic.
Oh,

2914
02:11:57,531 --> 02:11:58,420
there it is.
Okay.

2915
02:11:58,990 --> 02:12:02,090
17th until late 17th century.
A Dot d,

2916
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,490
the form of Coptic.
It was a gypsy.

2917
02:12:04,610 --> 02:12:07,790
Okay.
The national language of modern day

2918
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:09,380
Egyptian is Egyptian.
Arabic,

2919
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:12,650
which gradually replaced Coptic as the
language of daily life.

2920
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:13,820
That's bizarre,
right?

2921
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:17,120
Oh,
after the Muslims conquest in Egypt,

2922
02:12:17,121 --> 02:12:21,350
Coptic is still used as the literal or
drew litterer.

2923
02:12:21,530 --> 02:12:26,210
Litterer liturgical.
The typical liturgical language of the

2924
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:27,030
Coptic Church.
Wow.

2925
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:30,260
Competence.
I would have had a hard time with that

2926
02:12:30,261 --> 02:12:33,650
word to what does this King Tut's dagger
made from iron from the sky.

2927
02:12:33,651 --> 02:12:35,420
Oh yeah.
They found a dagger.

2928
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:37,550
That was King Tut's.
That came from a media,

2929
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:40,430
they took them beat here and hammered it
out

2930
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:42,450
yet,
but he's,

2931
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:44,180
you know,
there's a guy who does that today.

2932
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:46,970
He makes custom knives made out of
meteors.

2933
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:52,130
If you Google Anthony Bordain had a
knife made out of a media,

2934
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:54,770
how do you get the meteor?
Well,

2935
02:12:54,970 --> 02:12:58,490
you can collect them.
There's enough of them land in places

2936
02:12:58,491 --> 02:13:01,450
where people have collected them and you
can actually buy media rights.

2937
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:07,990
Literally iron iron from space.
So they take this iron from space and I

2938
02:13:08,070 --> 02:13:10,640
fell in to say his name is Klein Klein
knives,

2939
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:13,460
but he's Steve Klein said his name.
No,

2940
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:14,353
that's not his name.

2941
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:17,413
Kramer.
That's it.

2942
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:19,190
Steve Kramer.
Bob Kramer.

2943
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:21,770
Steve Klein is a awesome pool.
Cue Maker.

2944
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,260
My bad.
Yes.

2945
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,350
Bob Kramer.
Guy.

2946
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,330
How do they melt it?
I got a certain degree.

2947
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:29,690
Yeah,
they put it inside of this crazy furnace

2948
02:13:29,691 --> 02:13:32,250
and see this is what he's doing here.
Scroll down there so we could look at

2949
02:13:32,251 --> 02:13:33,570
it.
There we go.

2950
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:38,750
That's him hammering down these bars of
steel that came from a media.

2951
02:13:40,341 --> 02:13:42,810
Right?
And that's how they make a knife.

2952
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:45,870
They take it and they keep hammering it
and they keep throwing it to the fire

2953
02:13:45,871 --> 02:13:47,460
and hammering,
and this guy,

2954
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:52,440
Bob Kramer does it all himself.
I mean he does it like the old school

2955
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:57,441
way with obviously with new equipment,
but it's all from the beginning,

2956
02:13:57,630 --> 02:14:02,400
like he takes the metal and crafts it
and turns it into this insane looking

2957
02:14:02,430 --> 02:14:04,410
knife and at the end of the day,
I mean,

2958
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:09,411
you're cutting your food with a meteor.
Something from space to space.

2959
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:14,460
Apparently it's one,
it's one of the things that were most

2960
02:14:14,461 --> 02:14:19,461
terrified of when it comes to asteroids.
Some asteroids are just made out of

2961
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:22,620
iron,
a slice right through.

2962
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:27,680
Just imagine an asteroid that's the size
of Manhattan and it's all iron and a

2963
02:14:28,571 --> 02:14:31,170
half coming at us.
Forty 5,000 miles an hour.

2964
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:33,000
Sure,

2965
02:14:34,990 --> 02:14:37,540
boom.
You know,

2966
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:42,630
and it just rips the ocean and half go.
I think they said that if an asteroid

2967
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:45,700
that size,
like the one that killed the dinosaurs,

2968
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:50,380
the one that hit the Yucatan,
they said that within seconds it was

2969
02:14:50,381 --> 02:14:54,430
miles deep into the earth,
miles deep.

2970
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:57,370
That's like,
that's how

2971
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:03,550
mile deep.
I imagine.

2972
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:09,660
Just imagine that like the impact that
something has to have that don't put

2973
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:16,180
some of the size of a city to go miles
deep in the earth within seconds.

2974
02:15:16,630 --> 02:15:19,840
That's.
I would want to see that for some,

2975
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:22,840
like my sick mind,
I would want to see that just to look

2976
02:15:22,841 --> 02:15:24,710
down to see what's in there.
Yeah.

2977
02:15:24,730 --> 02:15:26,890
I've seen those animated ones.
I do online.

2978
02:15:26,891 --> 02:15:28,990
You get to look at like an ad,
but you know that's not really

2979
02:15:28,991 --> 02:15:31,480
happening.
It doesn't really have the same effect.

2980
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:32,360
Like you'll okay.
I,

2981
02:15:32,361 --> 02:15:32,950
yeah,
I get it.

2982
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:36,490
I get that's what it would look like,
but I think seeing it happen,

2983
02:15:36,491 --> 02:15:40,810
seeing that thing coming down,
what's fucked up is man,

2984
02:15:40,811 --> 02:15:44,980
you look up at the moon and this is
covered in craters covered.

2985
02:15:45,370 --> 02:15:47,140
They go,
well the moon is just,

2986
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,910
man,
why is the moon keep getting hit?

2987
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:51,940
We keep getting hit too.
We just covered in plants and shit.

2988
02:15:51,941 --> 02:15:55,600
We don't see it anymore.
We got water and plants that have made

2989
02:15:55,601 --> 02:15:57,970
us forget the moon doesn't have an
atmosphere too,

2990
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,000
so it burns up.
We lose a lot of the asteroids that are

2991
02:16:01,001 --> 02:16:03,910
coming in because of the atmosphere or
the asteroids,

2992
02:16:03,911 --> 02:16:04,810
meteorites,
whatever.

2993
02:16:04,811 --> 02:16:07,750
They are media whores,
but the moon doesn't have any of that

2994
02:16:07,751 --> 02:16:11,890
shit so it comes crashing down,
but I just think that we put out a bunch

2995
02:16:11,891 --> 02:16:14,830
of times.
We've been hit a bunch of times.

2996
02:16:14,831 --> 02:16:15,664
We just forgot.

2997
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:17,710
I,
I've never even thought of that.

2998
02:16:17,711 --> 02:16:19,240
I'm tripping out on there right now like
that.

2999
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:21,460
That sounds.
I know the Swedes good,

3000
02:16:21,850 --> 02:16:23,130
but like I'm fucking like,
wow.

3001
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:24,640
He's very sweet.
Very good.

3002
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:28,970
And like speaking to the moon,
like remember the Mayans discovered that

3003
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,880
the rabbit was on the moon.
Have you seen that?

3004
02:16:30,881 --> 02:16:34,120
That's their signal.
Like they say there's a rabbit face on

3005
02:16:34,121 --> 02:16:36,520
the moon.
The problem here is don't we always see

3006
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:38,920
the same side of the moon to the moon
doesn't spin,

3007
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:40,750
correct?
I don't think it does.

3008
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:45,160
I think the moon does not spin.
The moon faces us the same way all the

3009
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:46,780
time.
Pretty sure.

3010
02:16:48,310 --> 02:16:51,460
So that'll make sense.
The man on the moon,

3011
02:16:52,890 --> 02:16:55,030
there was some science thing from a long
time ago,

3012
02:16:55,031 --> 02:16:56,680
man,
where they thought they saw canals on

3013
02:16:56,681 --> 02:16:58,600
Mars.
They were convinced when this first

3014
02:16:58,601 --> 02:17:01,180
started looking at Mars,
there was canals and they were like,

3015
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:02,590
oh yeah,
that's what they thought.

3016
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:05,140
They thought they were not right,
but they were like,

3017
02:17:05,170 --> 02:17:08,170
Holy Shit,
we're looking at a civilization on Mars.

3018
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:11,110
Like people were preparing themselves to
make contact with the Martians.

3019
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:15,580
I trip out on us as humans.
We always want to go find something else

3020
02:17:15,581 --> 02:17:17,470
and go kick it with something else.
That's like,

3021
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,251
fuck that.
No,

3022
02:17:18,251 --> 02:17:20,710
there's someone over there.
I know there's someone at Mars.

3023
02:17:20,711 --> 02:17:22,390
We keep knocking,
but how open.

3024
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:27,010
I know,
I remember one time I had this thought

3025
02:17:27,011 --> 02:17:30,250
where I was like,
what if humans are so smooth that we've

3026
02:17:30,251 --> 02:17:34,270
already been on Mars and Saturn and all
that and we just fuck them up so we

3027
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:36,850
can't live there no more,
and that's why we're here and that's why

3028
02:17:36,851 --> 02:17:40,450
we keep looking for other ones to fuck
up.

3029
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:42,490
Well,
if we found someone over there and they

3030
02:17:42,491 --> 02:17:43,890
talk shit,
we definitely fuck them.

3031
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:47,290
That's a fact.
And tell me we fuck up people in

3032
02:17:47,291 --> 02:17:49,150
Afghanistan.
We wouldn't fuck up people on the moon.

3033
02:17:49,151 --> 02:17:50,210
Does the moon rotate?
Yeah,

3034
02:17:50,211 --> 02:17:51,100
it does.
It does.

3035
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:54,130
It spins synchronous rotation.
Oh,

3036
02:17:54,131 --> 02:17:57,590
it spins as we spin.
So we don't see it spinning.

3037
02:17:57,720 --> 02:17:58,553
Oh,
interesting.

3038
02:17:58,810 --> 02:18:01,980
So we see the same side every time.
That's one of the things that I was

3039
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:02,823
going to.

3040
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:09,130
The moon orbits the Earth once every 27
point three to two days.

3041
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:13,600
It also takes apparently 27 days to the
moon to rotate one on its access.

3042
02:18:13,601 --> 02:18:15,940
As a result,
the moon does not seem to be spinning,

3043
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:20,920
but appears to observers from earth to
be keeping almost perfectly still.

3044
02:18:20,921 --> 02:18:22,930
Scientists call this synchronous
rotation.

3045
02:18:22,931 --> 02:18:25,300
That's cool.
That's fucking cool.

3046
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:29,360
How does all that happen?
And stay in sequence and rock and roll

3047
02:18:29,361 --> 02:18:30,310
off.
I couldn't love it.

3048
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:31,750
Well,
how's it float up there?

3049
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:33,640
How come it's not Lenna are fucking
head.

3050
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,480
None of that makes.
That's like explain that.

3051
02:18:37,481 --> 02:18:39,940
How come the fucking asteroids come
flying in?

3052
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:41,800
But uh,
the moon just hovers.

3053
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:46,420
What if the moon just decided to jack us
hatred forever.

3054
02:18:46,421 --> 02:18:48,850
Motherfuckers and takes off,
you know.

3055
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:53,020
But they say that the moon is like a
residue of when the earth was created,

3056
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:56,830
that there was earth one,
the scientists have a model of earth and

3057
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:58,450
earth to an earth.

3058
02:18:58,450 --> 02:19:02,350
One was like this giant ball of fire and
gases,

3059
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:06,040
and we got hit with another planet like
in the early days of development of the

3060
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:08,590
earth.
We like another planet collided with

3061
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:10,510
Earth.
And that's what created the moon.

3062
02:19:10,570 --> 02:19:14,080
And that's what stabilized its orbit.
And that's the reason why apparently we

3063
02:19:14,081 --> 02:19:16,750
can survive is because if it wasn't for
the moon,

3064
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:19,870
we wouldn't have a steady atmosphere.
We wouldn't have a steady temperature,

3065
02:19:19,871 --> 02:19:22,720
wouldn't have a steady orbit,
we would vary too widely.

3066
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:26,050
And we would have never developed.
We'd all be like tardigrades in the

3067
02:19:26,051 --> 02:19:31,010
bottom of the ocean or some shit.
Some weird little indisputable nuclear

3068
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:35,750
single cell multicellular organisms or
something at his fucking crazy.

3069
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:36,940
Yeah.
The,

3070
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:38,210
what's now somehow Jana.

3071
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:41,740
I'm trying to find that the only thing
that comes up when I type in earth and

3072
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:44,260
earth to is a lot of stuff about DC
comics.

3073
02:19:44,650 --> 02:19:46,020
Oh No,
it was from um,

3074
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:47,060
no,
no,

3075
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:47,711
no.
It was,

3076
02:19:47,711 --> 02:19:49,990
um,
the earth wanted earth to.

3077
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:52,780
They actually do.
They actually talked about it in the

3078
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:54,880
Sumerian tax,
which is really kind of fascinating.

3079
02:19:55,210 --> 02:19:58,240
The Sumerian texts talked about Earth's
collision,

3080
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:00,390
that there was a planet,
it's called,

3081
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:05,080
like things called the planet's Tmr and
Marduke and they collided and it created

3082
02:20:05,081 --> 02:20:08,080
a earth and one of the.
And it also created the moon.

3083
02:20:08,110 --> 02:20:10,540
What's interesting,
what's interesting about that is that

3084
02:20:10,541 --> 02:20:14,290
they had figured this out 6,000
something years ago.

3085
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:16,600
Like this is even older than the
pyramids.

3086
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:18,640
Like,
oh yeah,

3087
02:20:18,641 --> 02:20:22,630
it's really old.
The ancient Sumerians were the oldest as

3088
02:20:22,631 --> 02:20:25,150
far as like what we currently know of
us,

3089
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:27,550
you know,
it changes all the time.

3090
02:20:27,551 --> 02:20:31,240
They find new stuff all the time.
But as far as what the archeologists

3091
02:20:31,241 --> 02:20:34,390
know of today is the oldest written
language,

3092
02:20:34,391 --> 02:20:38,260
the oldest mathematics,
like a gang of that stuff is thought to

3093
02:20:38,261 --> 02:20:39,580
be from that part of the world.

3094
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:44,760
So the same part of the world also knew
about all the planets in the right,

3095
02:20:44,861 --> 02:20:49,060
order it in the right size.
It's really strange that a telescope

3096
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:50,800
with.
We don't know what they knew,

3097
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:55,450
but they have had a.
They had these drawings in clay tablets

3098
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:57,310
where they had the picture,
the sun,

3099
02:20:57,340 --> 02:21:00,050
and they would picture it.
It would have earth who'd had Venus had

3100
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,680
Jupiter have all these planets like the
big ones.

3101
02:21:02,681 --> 02:21:06,460
Where were the big ones were the smaller
ones where they're the right size.

3102
02:21:06,490 --> 02:21:09,070
It's crazy.
Like how the fuck did they know?

3103
02:21:09,071 --> 02:21:10,630
This is kind of like that.
Like all right,

3104
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:13,510
make a right over there and go like if
they're going somewhere,

3105
02:21:14,110 --> 02:21:17,560
it's almost like they somehow or another
we could see them.

3106
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:21,160
How they could see them.
I don't understand.

3107
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:22,780
I don't.
I don't know what they figured out.

3108
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:25,030
They figured out something.
What is this?

3109
02:21:25,031 --> 02:21:25,550
Jamie

3110
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:30,550
says Zacharias petitions or a diagram of
what happened.

3111
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:33,480
See,
there's a problem with switching though.

3112
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:37,020
I'm obviously not a fucking scholar,
but the ones who are,

3113
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:40,110
they go over his stuff and they.
A lot of them don't agree with it and

3114
02:21:40,111 --> 02:21:42,810
there's an actual website.
It's called [inaudible] is wrong,

3115
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,970
might be.org or.com and it's all like
poking holes in his stuff.

3116
02:21:47,971 --> 02:21:50,910
His stuff is fun as fuck though.
It's fun to believe because he thinks

3117
02:21:50,911 --> 02:21:55,650
that we were created by aliens and the
aliens came from a planet called Nibiru

3118
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:59,310
and they came down here and they did
genetic manipulations with lower

3119
02:21:59,311 --> 02:22:03,240
primates and they created human beings.
That's pretty crazy.

3120
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:05,130
As the best.
It's so fun.

3121
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:11,460
I tripped out how people say that the
Egyptians were having sex with aliens

3122
02:22:11,461 --> 02:22:14,910
because of the old highly griffes.
They found like the aliens with their

3123
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:17,850
penises out with like they do
civilization.

3124
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:20,990
I think you might've been breeding some.
Yeah,

3125
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:22,031
for real.
Yeah.

3126
02:22:22,031 --> 02:22:24,360
We had alien penises and the
hieroglyphs.

3127
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:25,980
Yeah.
I thought

3128
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,390
I seen it all.
Now,

3129
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:29,620
and I read this.
I've read a book in prison,

3130
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:31,940
caught the biggest secret by David
Steiner,

3131
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:33,330
Einstein,
something like that.

3132
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:36,660
And He.
Did they show you the pictures in there?

3133
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:39,060
Wow.
I haven't seen that.

3134
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:41,210
Uh hmm.
It was it.

3135
02:22:41,211 --> 02:22:43,920
David Ike wasn't David.
It might have been.

3136
02:22:43,921 --> 02:22:46,140
It's been a long time.
It was just because you only got certain

3137
02:22:46,141 --> 02:22:48,720
books,
but David likes that guy that thinks if

3138
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:51,060
I was him,
I don't even know if he thinks it's

3139
02:22:51,061 --> 02:22:53,610
anymore,
but he used to think that the top

3140
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:55,830
leaders of the world,
we're all the reptilians.

3141
02:22:55,890 --> 02:22:56,760
Yes.
That's the guy.

3142
02:22:56,761 --> 02:22:57,720
That's the guy.
Yeah.

3143
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:01,440
I don't think that's correct.
I just tell you what,

3144
02:23:01,441 --> 02:23:05,420
I tripped out on
those.

3145
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,430
Those are three times for sure that I
would want to go back to.

3146
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:11,700
If you had to choose a place in time
where you can go back and just check it

3147
02:23:11,701 --> 02:23:12,900
out,
what would it be?

3148
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:18,200
Me.
I'd want to go back to the dinosaur time

3149
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:21,840
was a good call.
I fucked up.

3150
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:24,970
I should give up.
One of my stores are going to give up

3151
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,270
gangs for the dinosaur days.
Nah,

3152
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:32,340
Genghis Gangsta to give up somebody.
I definitely want to go back.

3153
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:35,310
I don't know.
Just this fucked

3154
02:23:36,910 --> 02:23:41,700
it was their land and then um,
just because I'm Mexican,

3155
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:46,500
I'd want to go back to like the
Cortez came.

3156
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:49,840
Yeah.
You got done

3157
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,910
that time.
Montezuma days?

3158
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:54,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

3159
02:23:54,630 --> 02:23:55,780
At all.
Yeah.

3160
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:56,501
No,
it's crazy,

3161
02:23:56,501 --> 02:23:58,510
man.
Whenever they're building shit in Mexico

3162
02:23:58,510 --> 02:24:00,190
City,
there was like digging into the ground

3163
02:24:00,191 --> 02:24:01,840
and they got to halt construction.
Stopped,

3164
02:24:01,870 --> 02:24:03,570
stop.
They find something funny.

3165
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:04,990
Shit.
They found a temple.

3166
02:24:04,991 --> 02:24:06,730
They find jewelry.
They find something.

3167
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:09,910
It's all over the place.
I guess there's this new,

3168
02:24:09,950 --> 02:24:12,040
uh,
airplane that shoots.

3169
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:12,903
It's like,
you know,

3170
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:16,340
you could do an ultrasound on a body
that at the airplane radar does an

3171
02:24:16,341 --> 02:24:18,820
ultrasound on the dirt or whatever.
The floor,

3172
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:22,000
the ground,
and they're trying to find temples over

3173
02:24:22,001 --> 02:24:23,680
there now.
Eddie Bravo is right.

3174
02:24:23,681 --> 02:24:26,110
There's that bonus was raised when the
sky try to find money.

3175
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:29,500
That's what it is.
He was just wrong with the method man.

3176
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:31,690
I think there's a gang of shit under
there,

3177
02:24:31,691 --> 02:24:33,610
but it's crazy because it's not that
long ago.

3178
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:34,390
No,
it's not.

3179
02:24:34,390 --> 02:24:35,223
You know what I mean?

3180
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:39,670
Cortez was one that was a 14 hundreds.
When did Cortez come here now would save

3181
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:43,600
the 14 hundreds and then the reason that
the temple's ain't even there no more is

3182
02:24:43,601 --> 02:24:47,200
because Catholicism took it out.
Catholicism who came in and then they

3183
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:50,410
buried the temples and built churches
over the temple's not crazy.

3184
02:24:50,411 --> 02:24:55,180
Like they built churches over the,
that's a big thing in Egypt to they're

3185
02:24:55,181 --> 02:24:59,830
finding like one period of construction
and then on top of that period of

3186
02:24:59,831 --> 02:25:02,440
construction there's some newer,
more modern shit.

3187
02:25:02,610 --> 02:25:04,590
And as they go onto the monitor,
they're like,

3188
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:06,700
well they built the modern shit on top
of the older shit.

3189
02:25:06,730 --> 02:25:09,970
Like what the fuck were they doing?
But they did it a gang of times in

3190
02:25:09,971 --> 02:25:11,200
history.
They think,

3191
02:25:11,590 --> 02:25:13,600
well,
are we doing it right now?

3192
02:25:13,601 --> 02:25:16,860
Like are we building a new coliseum over
the old fucking coliseum?

3193
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:19,270
We do.
We tear down houses.

3194
02:25:19,271 --> 02:25:21,820
People literally by what they call a
tear down house.

3195
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:23,610
He bought a house.
It's and,

3196
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,010
but it's on a

3197
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,590
nice lot and you know,
it's a big investment honey.

3198
02:25:26,591 --> 02:25:29,410
But I think a tear downs the right move.
He tear down that house and build a

3199
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:33,250
beautiful house.
And that spot as an original foundation.

3200
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:35,100
Yeah man,
that's a sad thing because um,

3201
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:37,270
when I was doing construction on the
east coast,

3202
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:41,740
you would run across these buildings
that had these old school nails.

3203
02:25:42,090 --> 02:25:43,870
Their nails galvanized,
right?

3204
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:44,890
Well,
was there were,

3205
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:48,130
there were like a wedge.
It wasn't like a circle with a straight

3206
02:25:48,131 --> 02:25:50,020
line,
like you know,

3207
02:25:50,021 --> 02:25:53,620
a nail has a point at the end of it,
but then it's a perfect kind of a

3208
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:56,740
perfect cylinder all the way up to the
top and it's got a flathead.

3209
02:25:56,770 --> 02:25:58,600
Yes.
These old nails weren't like that.

3210
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,900
These old nails were like a wedge.
It was like a steel wedge because they

3211
02:26:01,901 --> 02:26:06,700
were making them in a blacksmith so the
nails had like a top flat part where you

3212
02:26:06,701 --> 02:26:09,640
could hammer it in,
but instead of having like a long

3213
02:26:09,641 --> 02:26:13,900
straight cylinder,
it was actually a wedge and the pointy

3214
02:26:13,901 --> 02:26:17,890
end was the bottom of the wedge and they
would tap it in like that and that.

3215
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:21,700
That's what a nail was back then.
So when I was doing construction and you

3216
02:26:21,701 --> 02:26:24,070
would pull these,
you could tell when you were going into

3217
02:26:24,071 --> 02:26:26,010
an old ass building.
Yeah,

3218
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:27,240
that's what it looked like.
See,

3219
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:31,330
that's an old nail like that sales I
get.

3220
02:26:31,350 --> 02:26:33,520
I pulled a gang of those out of
buildings when I was a kid,

3221
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:38,700
but it's kind of sad in a way because
these houses that were made this way,

3222
02:26:38,831 --> 02:26:42,280
like some day people would love to see
that and go,

3223
02:26:42,281 --> 02:26:44,950
well,
this is like a piece of history to see

3224
02:26:44,951 --> 02:26:48,790
an old house that was built with the way
they would do the,

3225
02:26:48,791 --> 02:26:50,770
uh,
insulation to.

3226
02:26:50,771 --> 02:26:54,610
They have this like white shit that was
like in between these boards.

3227
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:56,110
It wasn't,
it wasn't.

3228
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:59,050
They didn't have a fiberglass back then
or anything,

3229
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:00,360
so it was like,
it's white plaster.

3230
02:27:00,361 --> 02:27:02,290
He Shit.
It wasn't like pink,

3231
02:27:02,810 --> 02:27:03,940
no pink stuff.

3232
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,530
The fiberglass stuff.
Okay.

3233
02:27:05,860 --> 02:27:08,050
That's the stuff that you have to put in
addicts and shit.

3234
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:10,900
Yeah.
You did construction that inside that

3235
02:27:10,901 --> 02:27:13,660
house.
Gut Shit inside the house is not fun if

3236
02:27:13,661 --> 02:27:16,270
you're doing an attic.
I did an addict once that,

3237
02:27:16,330 --> 02:27:20,050
that had the fiberglass shit in it.
Get it in your skin.

3238
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:23,860
You get all itchy everywhere.
You're itchy and you sweat and sweat

3239
02:27:23,861 --> 02:27:26,560
opens up your pores and the fiberglass
shit gets in there.

3240
02:27:27,210 --> 02:27:29,800
Can I ask you a question?
When you were stripping the nails from

3241
02:27:29,801 --> 02:27:32,170
the woodwork,
why were you taking the nails out where

3242
02:27:32,171 --> 02:27:34,450
you were working?
Were tearing something down,

3243
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:37,450
putting something in its place.
I don't remember whether or not it was

3244
02:27:37,451 --> 02:27:38,050
a,
um,

3245
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:42,040
a remodel or whether or not they were
putting an addition on or something like

3246
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:43,750
that.
But whenever you'd have to go into the

3247
02:27:43,751 --> 02:27:46,690
walls of these buildings,
you could tell right away because they

3248
02:27:46,691 --> 02:27:47,950
had these,
I forget,

3249
02:27:47,951 --> 02:27:51,880
I forget what you would call those long
thin boards that were stacked on top of

3250
02:27:51,881 --> 02:27:52,300
each other.

3251
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:54,970
As soon as you go through the plaster,
you feel the plaster and you would know

3252
02:27:54,971 --> 02:27:58,310
as the old house because it was like a
plaster instead of a wall board.

3253
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:01,270
When you go to a new house,
they have that wall wallboard stuff

3254
02:28:01,271 --> 02:28:01,870
which is,
you know,

3255
02:28:01,870 --> 02:28:03,280
gypsum board,
it's kind of thin.

3256
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:05,620
It doesn't have a lot of like mass to
it.

3257
02:28:05,621 --> 02:28:09,070
And then behind that you would have all
the other stuff and then insulation and

3258
02:28:09,071 --> 02:28:11,470
shit.
But in these old houses it wasn't like

3259
02:28:11,471 --> 02:28:12,450
that.
It was like these.

3260
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:17,950
I can't call them thin,
just really thin long boards and in

3261
02:28:17,951 --> 02:28:21,330
between there's this white plaster he
shit and there was plaster over the of

3262
02:28:21,430 --> 02:28:25,360
shingles shingles,
but like little thin boards like a,

3263
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:25,880
you know,
like,

3264
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:30,880
not even a half inch thick by like maybe
an interest so wide and they had those

3265
02:28:31,491 --> 02:28:34,040
kinds of nails that put them into the
studs.

3266
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:35,040
I got you now.
Yeah.

3267
02:28:35,041 --> 02:28:38,050
And so he'd pull those nails out and you
don't always recognize.

3268
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,451
I'm like,
wow,

3269
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:40,550
there's an old fucking house because New
England,

3270
02:28:40,551 --> 02:28:42,230
that was an old place,
you know what I mean?

3271
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:46,010
You could go to England today and see
there's graves that you could visit that

3272
02:28:46,011 --> 02:28:48,900
are from like the 17 hundreds.
Yeah.

3273
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:50,720
They have a grape still there.
Yeah,

3274
02:28:50,721 --> 02:28:51,680
they're still there.
You know,

3275
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:55,700
it's slowly but surely the numbers are
getting more eroded by the atmosphere

3276
02:28:55,701 --> 02:28:56,810
and stuff.
But it's still there.

3277
02:28:56,811 --> 02:28:59,150
You still read them.
Some of them are kind of faint.

3278
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:02,770
You think in 100 years,
like they're going to have to like

3279
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:07,760
discover a new method for burying us
because it's stupid to bury people.

3280
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:09,500
It's stupid.
The only reason why we should bury

3281
02:29:09,501 --> 02:29:11,000
people in,
well,

3282
02:29:11,001 --> 02:29:15,980
it's also what we're doing is we are,
we're keeping the natural process of us

3283
02:29:15,981 --> 02:29:20,810
becoming useful to the world because
like when things die,

3284
02:29:21,050 --> 02:29:23,450
those things are absorbed by the
environment.

3285
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:27,680
There's a system in place set up.
I mean if you just buried someone,

3286
02:29:27,740 --> 02:29:30,410
if you just opened up a whole,
put them in the ground and bury them.

3287
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:33,890
The natural course of order would take
place.

3288
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:36,440
The bacteria and their body would break
down their body.

3289
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:38,420
The,
the soil would absorb their body.

3290
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:42,890
They'd become fertilizer like every
animal has from the beginning of time.

3291
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:46,700
But we're so weird.
We want to fill our dead bodies up with

3292
02:29:46,701 --> 02:29:50,780
some shit that keeps them from rotting.
And then we put makeup on them and dress

3293
02:29:50,781 --> 02:29:53,390
them up in their best clothes with Mike,
my grandfather,

3294
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:54,820
when he died,
they put one of those,

3295
02:29:54,821 --> 02:29:57,160
um,
crucifixes with the,

3296
02:29:57,161 --> 02:30:00,110
what are those things called?
The crucifix with the Rosary,

3297
02:30:00,210 --> 02:30:03,800
with the rosary about and like,
like he never even went to church.

3298
02:30:03,801 --> 02:30:04,730
Like,
what are you doing here?

3299
02:30:04,731 --> 02:30:05,564
Like,
what is this?

3300
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:07,960
He's clutching his face.
He's got this.

3301
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,060
He's so,
this does no feel to him,

3302
02:30:11,090 --> 02:30:13,670
you know,
he's gone and they're going to take him

3303
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,360
and they're going to put them in a box
and then they're going to buried in the

3304
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:20,420
ground and it's probably,
you go dig it out today if I probably

3305
02:30:20,421 --> 02:30:23,450
wanted to go in there today,
his body still in there because those

3306
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:27,830
things don't rot because they're filled
up with formaldehyde and all crazy.

3307
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:30,560
It's real weird.
The only reason why it makes sense as to

3308
02:30:30,561 --> 02:30:33,320
prove murder cases and shit like that.
I mean that's,

3309
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:36,650
that's about it.
Like maybe if the death is weird,

3310
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:38,660
the death is weird.
You should probably like,

3311
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:42,100
you know,
he was,

3312
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:44,690
he thought like you can't prove it yet,
but something,

3313
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:48,080
something went down because they've
caught people for murders by going and

3314
02:30:48,081 --> 02:30:50,810
digging up the bodies and finding
arsenic and their system or something

3315
02:30:50,811 --> 02:30:51,860
like that.
They've done that.

3316
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:53,660
That's weird though.
But like,

3317
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:56,240
I dunno,
it's Kinda like a case close homies.

3318
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:59,660
I should've got away with it now if you
bear it and you can't bring them back.

3319
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:00,980
Yeah.
But if they catch you,

3320
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:06,160
so you're thinking layer convict.
You didn't get away.

3321
02:31:06,590 --> 02:31:07,131
No,
no.

3322
02:31:07,131 --> 02:31:10,030
I beat the game.
He's in the ground that.

3323
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:11,120
Come on.
Fuck.

3324
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:14,480
It's just a.
it's a barbaric way of.

3325
02:31:14,590 --> 02:31:15,120
It's.
It's,

3326
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:16,600
it's an inhumane way.
It's.

3327
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:19,380
It's not a smart thing.
It's a custom plus.

3328
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,190
It's

3329
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:23,640
a giant racket.
It's a huge financial racket.

3330
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:26,100
Joey Diaz as the first one to explain
that to me,

3331
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:29,790
it goes dark.
The wars fucking racket that nobody ever

3332
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:32,700
talks about funerals.
Think about it.

3333
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:35,310
What the fuck you going to do?
What the fuck are you going to do?

3334
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:38,810
You're going to spend that money though,
and he goes to that cheap box.

3335
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:41,130
It's like $1,000,
$2,000.

3336
02:31:41,131 --> 02:31:44,310
You've got to pay the funeral costs,
you got to pay for this service,

3337
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:47,010
and he's explaining everything.
You have to have a plot of land.

3338
02:31:47,011 --> 02:31:47,580
I'm like,
what?

3339
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:48,960
Oh my God,
I never thought about that.

3340
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:51,090
And he's like,
it obliterates people.

3341
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:53,280
It obliterates them.
It puts them in massive debt.

3342
02:31:54,210 --> 02:31:56,920
Thousands of dollars in debt like that.
Mandatories.

3343
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,860
Yeah,
and it's mandatory and it's mandatory.

3344
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:00,750
I mean,
I guess there must be some sort of

3345
02:32:00,751 --> 02:32:03,810
programs in place to take care of bodies
and people can't afford anything.

3346
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:07,230
I mean I would imagine there is,
but just the practice itself,

3347
02:32:07,231 --> 02:32:09,930
the fact that it's not just common,
it's standard.

3348
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,170
That's the standard practice.
It's a crazy way to take care of bodies,

3349
02:32:13,171 --> 02:32:14,340
man.
It's ridiculous.

3350
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:17,370
Yeah.
Like I remember like telling my kids

3351
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:19,740
like a,
if there's any way you can make it

3352
02:32:19,741 --> 02:32:21,920
happen,
I want to be buried in this fucking

3353
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:25,290
backyard right here.
If you could make it happen,

3354
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:27,090
but then they're gonna go to jail.
Yeah,

3355
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:30,960
because
I guess there's like certain walls.

3356
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:36,020
Well the should be because if you have a
well and you put your body and your body

3357
02:32:38,431 --> 02:32:40,890
rots into that,
well it gets people sick.

3358
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:44,760
People have died from that.
So that is something where I used to

3359
02:32:44,761 --> 02:32:45,950
live in Burbank.
There was a,

3360
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:50,160
a gravestone of a dead baby that
underneath the steps going up to our

3361
02:32:50,161 --> 02:32:52,800
apartment buildings,
like seven apartment Jesus random street

3362
02:32:52,801 --> 02:32:53,634
and it was like a,
the,

3363
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:56,310
the birth and the death date or seven
days apart.

3364
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:58,890
It was like 50,
70 years.

3365
02:32:58,891 --> 02:33:01,080
He goes a long time ago.
It wasn't like it just happened either.

3366
02:33:01,420 --> 02:33:04,500
It's super weird that just built stairs
over top of it.

3367
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:07,890
We're really,
really weird spot.

3368
02:33:07,930 --> 02:33:09,210
So strange.
Jesus,

3369
02:33:10,030 --> 02:33:12,450
you know what else is strange?
Your voice coming through that shitty

3370
02:33:12,451 --> 02:33:15,600
wire active before and it worked even
earlier.

3371
02:33:15,601 --> 02:33:17,230
It was working fine.
I need to just replace it.

3372
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:19,380
Okay,
no worries.

3373
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:20,530
It was weird though,
right?

3374
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:22,333
Yeah,
man.

3375
02:33:22,340 --> 02:33:25,020
It's a strange thing when you drive by
this beautiful plot of land and saw

3376
02:33:25,070 --> 02:33:27,630
these cement stone sticking out of the
ground.

3377
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:31,050
Let the.
It's also weird too that it has to be

3378
02:33:31,051 --> 02:33:34,320
public.
It has to like your dad has to be buried

3379
02:33:34,321 --> 02:33:38,970
in some giant field with all these other
people's dead people like why?

3380
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,650
Why do we have to all be together in
death?

3381
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:43,620
Only
death only.

3382
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:48,510
You get a small spot and then a couple
of feet overs another person and you

3383
02:33:48,511 --> 02:33:52,770
have to be buried in these areas where
we designate that people go to cry and

3384
02:33:52,771 --> 02:33:57,771
drop flowers is goofy as fuck.
It's one of those things.

3385
02:33:58,201 --> 02:34:00,390
It's just always.
We've always done it that way so we

3386
02:34:00,391 --> 02:34:03,990
don't stop and think like what kind of.
It's kind of like marriage.

3387
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,430
He's the same shit.
Similar.

3388
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:07,560
Both of them.
You keep the death.

3389
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:08,713
Yeah.

3390
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:12,990
It's just weird that nobody does
anything else.

3391
02:34:13,050 --> 02:34:15,030
Like one of the.
You could not get married if you choose

3392
02:34:15,031 --> 02:34:15,481
to.
If you go,

3393
02:34:15,481 --> 02:34:16,410
you know,
fuck marriage,

3394
02:34:16,411 --> 02:34:19,140
man.
I don't want to be legally entangled

3395
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:20,710
with some person if I want to break up
with him.

3396
02:34:20,711 --> 02:34:23,260
I just wanted to be able to just leave
one at my own choice.

3397
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:26,110
I can't do that to death,
but that's kind of the same way.

3398
02:34:26,111 --> 02:34:28,510
Like when when people die,
like you have to give them,

3399
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:30,430
you have to do something,
you have to either cremate them.

3400
02:34:30,710 --> 02:34:32,890
Oh you have to.
And I think even when you cremate them,

3401
02:34:32,891 --> 02:34:34,960
I think you have to do the formaldehyde
think first.

3402
02:34:34,961 --> 02:34:36,640
Yeah,
I'm kind of scared.

3403
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:40,120
I kinda told my kids I want them to
cremate me too because I was,

3404
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:42,790
I don't want to be maggots eating meat
and shit like that.

3405
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:44,170
No.
Now I don't know.

3406
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:46,420
That's the way to go.
Maggots is the way to go.

3407
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:50,620
The way to go is the fucking
formaldehyde because Formaldehyde,

3408
02:34:50,660 --> 02:34:53,590
like whatever use that you would have
for.

3409
02:34:53,591 --> 02:34:58,591
Although the organisms that would
normally devour any sort of dead living

3410
02:34:59,261 --> 02:35:01,630
creature,
a creature that becomes dead,

3411
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:03,790
that's not.
They don't get to eat anymore.

3412
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:06,730
For some reason,
we've decided that they don't get to

3413
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:10,060
consume your body.
Like your body is more important than

3414
02:35:10,150 --> 02:35:12,520
all the other things that it consumes.
We're part of the ECO.

3415
02:35:12,550 --> 02:35:16,390
It's one more way that we've separated
ourselves from the system.

3416
02:35:16,450 --> 02:35:18,580
This natural system that we're in,
we're.

3417
02:35:18,581 --> 02:35:20,380
We're,
we're delusional.

3418
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:23,290
Like we think we're not a part of this
system because we have houses and air

3419
02:35:23,291 --> 02:35:25,630
conditioning and I go to the supermarket
from our food.

3420
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:29,860
We're a part of the system for sure,
but that's one more way we separate

3421
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:32,710
ourselves.
Imagine if animals had cemeteries and

3422
02:35:32,711 --> 02:35:36,280
shit that would be fucked up.
There'd be no room for anything.

3423
02:35:36,281 --> 02:35:39,700
Then they're dying like crazy.
Imagine the cemeteries are just all the

3424
02:35:39,701 --> 02:35:41,320
birds that cats kill.

3425
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:49,000
You will realize what kind of mass
murder of monsters you're living with.

3426
02:35:50,390 --> 02:35:51,730
You.
Everywhere you go,

3427
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:53,140
he'd be like,
what is going on?

3428
02:35:53,141 --> 02:35:57,340
Like this is all the cats killing birds.
They just look everywhere.

3429
02:35:57,430 --> 02:35:59,160
You wouldn't be able to walk everywhere
you would walk.

3430
02:35:59,161 --> 02:36:02,200
It'd be like a little gravestone for a
bird that was killed by a cat.

3431
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:04,271
You know,
I,

3432
02:36:04,271 --> 02:36:06,970
I agree with you now as far as like,
yeah man,

3433
02:36:06,971 --> 02:36:09,490
don't get cremated.
It's made process.

3434
02:36:09,491 --> 02:36:12,550
You're supposed to go in there and just.
It's the way it goes.

3435
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:15,910
I think the problem is diseases though.
I think what they're worried about is

3436
02:36:15,911 --> 02:36:18,030
what we're talking about,
but I don't think if you're.

3437
02:36:18,610 --> 02:36:23,500
I guess if they formaldehyde you up and
they drop you in the ground,

3438
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:26,380
you don't rot so you don't leak into the
water system.

3439
02:36:26,770 --> 02:36:31,030
He just sorta like just sit there and
prune up.

3440
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:33,400
I don't think you're right for a long
ass time,

3441
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:36,190
but if you did rot,
I could see that.

3442
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:38,620
If you somehow or another gotten a water
system,

3443
02:36:39,650 --> 02:36:40,270
if there's a.
like,

3444
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:41,710
especially if you're dealing with a
city,

3445
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:43,990
that's when it becomes impractical.
Right?

3446
02:36:43,991 --> 02:36:47,410
Because if you're like New York City,
small spot less than,

3447
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:50,110
what is it?
Like what does New York have like 7

3448
02:36:50,110 --> 02:36:51,640
million or 8 million people live in the
city,

3449
02:36:51,641 --> 02:36:54,820
something crazy like that.
They're all stuffed into this area,

3450
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:58,210
you know,
way smaller than La and they were just

3451
02:36:58,211 --> 02:36:59,320
jammed in there.
Right?

3452
02:36:59,440 --> 02:37:01,510
What would they do if they had dead
bodies?

3453
02:37:01,511 --> 02:37:02,920
They're all stacked on top of each
other.

3454
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:04,090
What are they going to do with the dead
bodies?

3455
02:37:04,091 --> 02:37:07,000
They almost have to cremate them or have
to embalm them.

3456
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:10,030
Like you can't burry him anywhere.
You got to take them out of town and

3457
02:37:10,031 --> 02:37:12,370
throw them in the ocean.
What are you gonna do?

3458
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:15,980
That's crazy.
Should be all thrown in the

3459
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,690
ocean.
Right?

3460
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:19,880
Should have a law.
Like you only get out.

3461
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:25,000
You got to be 10 miles off shore,
but you're going to get eaten in there

3462
02:37:25,161 --> 02:37:26,390
by that.
Doug,

3463
02:37:26,410 --> 02:37:27,440
ed,
my crabs,

3464
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:30,440
lobsters and shit.
And then in turn you'll find a good spot

3465
02:37:30,441 --> 02:37:34,180
to catch lobsters.
That's what it used to.

3466
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:37,910
I remember my Grandpa,
he made the best stone crabs.

3467
02:37:38,470 --> 02:37:43,070
We've caught stone crabs right where
grandpa died or were we dropped his body

3468
02:37:43,071 --> 02:37:45,380
off.
That's what they did with Osama bin

3469
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:45,730
Laden.
Right?

3470
02:37:45,730 --> 02:37:46,780
Chuck them in the ocean.
Yeah.

3471
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:48,650
That's fucking crazy.
It was crazy.

3472
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:49,880
That's why I trip out.
I was like,

3473
02:37:49,881 --> 02:37:50,714
dude,
that's.

3474
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:52,430
People are like,
our president is not black.

3475
02:37:52,431 --> 02:37:54,050
I like,
he killed that full and throw them over

3476
02:37:54,051 --> 02:37:57,710
the boat.
That's gangster as full kill someone.

3477
02:37:57,711 --> 02:38:00,010
Takes them and get the fuck outta here.
Dot.

3478
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:02,870
I wonder what the.
Who made the decision to do it that way?

3479
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:07,250
Because it was a two day decision was
because I guess Muslim,

3480
02:38:07,310 --> 02:38:12,200
they have like a real special ritual
like two days after the body has to be

3481
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:14,100
done something.
Oh,

3482
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:16,550
interesting.
So they did it quick.

3483
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,403
Yeah,
the whole.

3484
02:38:18,410 --> 02:38:21,710
Well you're not supposed to do that in
the Muslim faith.

3485
02:38:21,711 --> 02:38:23,390
I don't think you're supposed to throw
the bodies overboard.

3486
02:38:23,450 --> 02:38:24,830
I think that's one of the reasons why
they did it.

3487
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:28,760
That's one of those ones that's going to
go down in history.

3488
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:32,900
You know when people are going to look
back at historical moments there just

3489
02:38:32,901 --> 02:38:36,350
seem crazy in the future.
I just killed them and thrown in the

3490
02:38:36,351 --> 02:38:37,610
ocean.
Ooh,

3491
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:39,050
whoa.
It's dark.

3492
02:38:39,350 --> 02:38:40,011
Yeah.
I mean,

3493
02:38:40,011 --> 02:38:43,370
I guess they said they didn't want him
to be a mortar or they didn't want to

3494
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:46,700
martyr martyr know.
Yeah,

3495
02:38:46,701 --> 02:38:48,380
I mean it makes sense.
I guess.

3496
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:50,030
I mean they would understand it better
than I would.

3497
02:38:50,031 --> 02:38:53,420
I would just be speculating as to what
you should and shouldn't do with the

3498
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:56,720
body of a mastermind terrorist that you
just killed.

3499
02:38:57,020 --> 02:39:00,200
They've been looking for for years that
was living in the house.

3500
02:39:00,830 --> 02:39:04,610
Imagine that his took his brain and
they've been working on probably what

3501
02:39:04,611 --> 02:39:05,600
happened.
I like Saddam.

3502
02:39:06,090 --> 02:39:06,641
Oh,
the hunting.

3503
02:39:06,641 --> 02:39:10,010
That motherfucker.
They probably fed to his dogs.

3504
02:39:10,700 --> 02:39:11,533
They're smart.

3505
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:13,550
Yeah.
That what they did.

3506
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:14,600
Well they,
you know,

3507
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:16,940
Saddam,
his sons used to have dogs.

3508
02:39:17,390 --> 02:39:19,760
They would throw people to the dogs and
feed them to the dogs.

3509
02:39:20,380 --> 02:39:22,640
He was like Ramsay Bolton from game of
thrones,

3510
02:39:22,670 --> 02:39:27,040
like legitimately is his kids were
psychopaths,

3511
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:29,060
total murderers,
mass murderers.

3512
02:39:29,061 --> 02:39:31,820
They would.
They would find women that we're about

3513
02:39:31,821 --> 02:39:33,380
to get married,
take them from their husbands,

3514
02:39:33,381 --> 02:39:35,210
rape them,
and then feed them to the dogs.

3515
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:37,460
I think I've seen that in a movie.
Yeah.

3516
02:39:37,820 --> 02:39:40,940
Probably buried his body near the
graves.

3517
02:39:40,941 --> 02:39:45,290
Of his other family members.
You got lucky.

3518
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:47,780
It's hard part of the world,
man.

3519
02:39:47,781 --> 02:39:49,610
Again,
it's like we were talking about that

3520
02:39:49,611 --> 02:39:52,280
part of the world so much different than
Santa Monica.

3521
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:55,790
Hell yeah.
You know,

3522
02:39:55,791 --> 02:39:58,100
and it really is a perspective thing,
isn't it?

3523
02:39:58,480 --> 02:39:59,870
Yeah.
It's a trip like

3524
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:03,440
everyone's all talking about like,
oh,

3525
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:05,480
over there in Saudi Arabia,
women in them,

3526
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:07,640
women don't have rights.
Women don't do this.

3527
02:40:07,641 --> 02:40:09,850
Or women do is cook and clean.
I was just like,

3528
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:13,610
be happy.
You are where you are there not

3529
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:14,130
tripping.

3530
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,550
They're living their life over there.
Do what?

3531
02:40:15,570 --> 02:40:16,620
Am I against it?
Yeah.

3532
02:40:16,621 --> 02:40:19,290
But they haven't changed what they
wanted to do.

3533
02:40:19,650 --> 02:40:22,080
They might be tripping hard.
They just can't do shit about it.

3534
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:27,490
I understand that people on the outside
look at it and see it's horrible and uh,

3535
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:31,200
it'll all because of that,
because of people's attitudes.

3536
02:40:31,201 --> 02:40:34,710
I think that's what changes things
because people get upset at it because

3537
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:37,260
then that word gets back to them.
The rest of the world,

3538
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:39,780
chicks can go to school the rest of the
world that can drive.

3539
02:40:39,781 --> 02:40:41,850
They don't have to dress up in those
outfits.

3540
02:40:41,851 --> 02:40:44,460
They can do whatever the fuck they want.
They're treated just like regular people

3541
02:40:44,461 --> 02:40:46,620
like the rest of the world.
Most of the rest of the world.

3542
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:49,110
That's where it's going.
You guys are stuck in a bad spot.

3543
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:53,070
Do you see the thing that happened with
North Korea?

3544
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:56,640
They let the world accidentally opened
up their websites.

3545
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:58,530
They only have 28 websites.
Yeah,

3546
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:01,710
I didn't read up on it.
I seen it like a little glimpse of it.

3547
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:04,590
How crazy is that?
That they have 28 websites.

3548
02:41:05,890 --> 02:41:08,040
Fuck bad.
Like what do they have?

3549
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:11,520
What the fuck did they show?
Like what they had?

3550
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:12,480
Anything?
No,

3551
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:14,610
I don't know.
I mean obviously it's in those Korean

3552
02:41:14,611 --> 02:41:15,810
symbols.
I wouldn't be able to read it,

3553
02:41:15,811 --> 02:41:17,420
but I don't know if anybody's translated
it.

3554
02:41:18,190 --> 02:41:19,650
What they had.
I haven't read that yet.

3555
02:41:19,651 --> 02:41:24,651
Jamie view on no house has a laptop,
no house and all.

3556
02:41:24,901 --> 02:41:28,980
I'd have a personal computer.
It says an airline ticket agency for air

3557
02:41:29,430 --> 02:41:31,740
core.
Choreo Choreo,

3558
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:34,710
a website for a group called national
unity.

3559
02:41:34,711 --> 02:41:39,711
A website for Kim Il Sung University
website for the Voice of Korea news

3560
02:41:39,721 --> 02:41:42,540
organization,
a news website for the government of

3561
02:41:42,541 --> 02:41:46,800
North Korea.
That place is fucking crazy that that

3562
02:41:46,801 --> 02:41:47,730
exists today.

3563
02:41:47,730 --> 02:41:52,730
That there is a country that is right
next to another country that looks

3564
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:56,700
exactly like them.
Like North Koreans and South Koreans are

3565
02:41:56,701 --> 02:41:57,840
fucking Koreans,
right?

3566
02:41:57,910 --> 02:41:59,610
They.
They look super similar,

3567
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:03,660
right?
It's not like Mexicans and Africans.

3568
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:07,110
It's not like two distinctly different
looking kinds of people know that

3569
02:42:07,130 --> 02:42:09,420
they're incredibly identical,
right?

3570
02:42:09,630 --> 02:42:13,440
But above them,
they have North Korea and they're living

3571
02:42:13,530 --> 02:42:16,350
in a dictatorship,
a military,

3572
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:20,580
straight up dictatorship.
The entire country is under the heel of

3573
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:23,970
a dictator,
a crazy military,

3574
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,170
ruthless dictator with nuclear bombs
detonated nuclear bombs and tests and

3575
02:42:28,171 --> 02:42:29,730
shit.
Then the other side,

3576
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:32,580
you've got people making the best
electronics in the world.

3577
02:42:33,010 --> 02:42:35,280
If I go flying innovation,
they're all getting.

3578
02:42:35,310 --> 02:42:37,050
They're all getting surgery.
You get their eyes bigger.

3579
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:38,930
They're and all that shit.
No,

3580
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:39,860
they're good.
They're eyes bigger.

3581
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:40,770
No,
dude,

3582
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:45,450
it is a huge problem in Korea is a
plastic surgery.

3583
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:48,480
I don't shouldn't say huge problem
because then it's not like they die.

3584
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:52,410
They just look different.
They're get plastic surgery is a huge

3585
02:42:52,411 --> 02:42:54,600
fad in,
in South Korea,

3586
02:42:55,020 --> 02:42:57,630
so they're not getting their titties
done and they're getting everything

3587
02:42:57,631 --> 02:42:58,464
done,
I'm sure,

3588
02:42:58,470 --> 02:43:00,970
but one of the things they're doing is
they're getting their eyes done so that

3589
02:43:00,971 --> 02:43:02,940
they look more American.
What's.

3590
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:06,000
What's the process?
Do they cut of the eyelid eyelid?

3591
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:07,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

3592
02:43:07,390 --> 02:43:08,090
How?
How,

3593
02:43:08,090 --> 02:43:09,930
how do they,
how do they use it?

3594
02:43:10,370 --> 02:43:12,070
They used to look like that's the look
like now.

3595
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:14,020
Little girls.
Fucking girls.

3596
02:43:14,030 --> 02:43:17,410
Let's start looking like Anna Mae.
It's really strange,

3597
02:43:17,411 --> 02:43:19,870
man.
It's a real strange like that.

3598
02:43:19,871 --> 02:43:20,230
They,
they,

3599
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:25,090
they become super hot looking.
Even if they were like not that hot,

3600
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:27,230
it's very,
it's just a bizarre practice man.

3601
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:32,790
See that's where they do cut down there
and cut down there and then you can see

3602
02:43:32,891 --> 02:43:35,710
what she looks like when it's all done,
but it's,

3603
02:43:35,711 --> 02:43:36,790
you know,
I mean it's not like,

3604
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:40,870
oh that girl got a lot of work done.
She had her chin shaved down.

3605
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:44,080
She had her eyes done and her ears.
Yeah.

3606
02:43:44,110 --> 02:43:45,730
Well I don't know what her hair looked
pretty big.

3607
02:43:45,731 --> 02:43:50,730
Still her.
It's a plastic surgeries critique.

3608
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:54,430
Pretty crazy what they can do.
They can alter your shape.

3609
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:56,560
I said that girl.
Oh my God,

3610
02:43:56,830 --> 02:44:00,340
don't do.
They shaved the fuck out of her jaw.

3611
02:44:00,341 --> 02:44:02,950
That's insane.
They turned to a new hottie.

3612
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:07,150
Amazing.
Amazing what they can do.

3613
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:10,390
Right.
But apparently it's super common.

3614
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:12,490
Super Common in Korea.
Wow.

3615
02:44:12,491 --> 02:44:14,560
Look at the before and after.
That's weird.

3616
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:17,720
Yeah.
When I met with the girl now she don't

3617
02:44:17,721 --> 02:44:19,630
got no baby pictures.
I don't fuck around with them.

3618
02:44:22,010 --> 02:44:26,800
Say you need to have some baby pictures.
Yeah.

3619
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,940
Did.
And I used to work at a strip club.

3620
02:44:29,060 --> 02:44:30,800
I was like,
this dude,

3621
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:32,780
he was hot.
I didn't know he was the dude,

3622
02:44:32,781 --> 02:44:36,110
but like he'd always hugged me from the
back and someone is like,

3623
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:37,640
hey dog,
this guy right here,

3624
02:44:37,641 --> 02:44:42,080
he's a retired.
This girl's a guy girl was a guy.

3625
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:45,470
He was on like transexuals.com,
Orange County,

3626
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:50,580
Kala.
And I remember her stage name was Monica

3627
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:52,760
and mean one time I was high and I was,
hey man,

3628
02:44:55,410 --> 02:44:59,840
I've never ever been like,
grabbed so hard like that thrown out of

3629
02:44:59,841 --> 02:45:01,670
my chair.
Wow.

3630
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:05,090
She got aggressive yet I remember after
that,

3631
02:45:05,091 --> 02:45:07,670
always saying a dog.
I need to see baby pictures.

3632
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:08,720
Everybody.

3633
02:45:12,170 --> 02:45:13,490
Yeah.
There's some little trick you,

3634
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:15,000
that's for sure.
Yeah.

3635
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:17,240
You will never know unless they choose
to tell you.

3636
02:45:18,550 --> 02:45:20,840
Like if you see what they're doing right
now with chins and eyes.

3637
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:24,320
Imagine what they could do to your
nether regions.

3638
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:25,850
Yeah.
It's going to get crazier.

3639
02:45:26,030 --> 02:45:29,240
They get conjure up
vagina.

3640
02:45:29,241 --> 02:45:32,960
That looks like a work of art.
I'm sure it was probably like the best

3641
02:45:32,990 --> 02:45:35,270
in the world.
It's probably a guy who's like,

3642
02:45:35,271 --> 02:45:39,230
you know,
the Frank Frazetta of surgical vaginas

3643
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:44,240
just makes this incredible work of art.
Puts the memory foam back in.

3644
02:45:46,230 --> 02:45:49,310
I wonder if they've ever done that.
I wonder if anybody's ever had like a

3645
02:45:49,311 --> 02:45:51,740
vaginal implant to make your vagina
tighter.

3646
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:53,660
You know,
like they'll get boob jobs,

3647
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:55,030
like you get a breast implant.
Sure.

3648
02:45:55,190 --> 02:45:56,960
Boom.
Spoke out more in something like that.

3649
02:45:57,380 --> 02:45:59,120
But they rejuvenation thing.
Yeah.

3650
02:45:59,121 --> 02:46:01,310
But I think they just tighten up the
whole.

3651
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:04,040
Yeah,
like the inside they cut.

3652
02:46:04,220 --> 02:46:06,200
I think the way they do,
and this is going to sound horrible

3653
02:46:06,201 --> 02:46:09,380
folks.
I think they cut you and then they the

3654
02:46:09,381 --> 02:46:14,381
two sides and stitch you the fuck up and
I think it hurts like a mother fucker.

3655
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:18,260
The things people are doing to satisfy
each other.

3656
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:19,680
Yeah.
We need.

3657
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:22,790
We need more constantly.
Constantly has to get better,

3658
02:46:22,791 --> 02:46:25,700
more,
more tart or plus a magnetometer.

3659
02:46:27,430 --> 02:46:29,570
Surgery.
Time for surgery,

3660
02:46:29,690 --> 02:46:31,580
increase in vaginal tightening,
surgeries,

3661
02:46:31,581 --> 02:46:34,990
worries doctors.
Oh my God worries him.

3662
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:40,620
It's going to make Dick Shrink.
We should let natural selection tickets

3663
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:42,220
course.
Yeah.

3664
02:46:43,380 --> 02:46:46,040
I mean,
who cares?

3665
02:46:46,060 --> 02:46:46,970
I think you can.
They do it.

3666
02:46:46,971 --> 02:46:49,790
I don't know why not.
If I was one of those girls and I had a

3667
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:52,390
crazy big fucked up John,
they shrank it down and all of a sudden

3668
02:46:52,391 --> 02:46:54,860
now it became hot as fuck and everybody
wanted to talk to me.

3669
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:57,380
I think I spend my money wisely.
I would go for that.

3670
02:46:57,710 --> 02:46:59,450
Yeah,
I mean exactly.

3671
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:00,800
I mean,
if I had to do it,

3672
02:47:00,801 --> 02:47:04,280
I do it too,
but isn't it bizarre that there's a very

3673
02:47:04,281 --> 02:47:09,200
specific shape that we like and we don't
like when it comes to people,

3674
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:12,200
whether it's the shape of the nose or
shape of the jaw,

3675
02:47:12,410 --> 02:47:14,900
like we agree so much.
There's too much.

3676
02:47:14,930 --> 02:47:17,040
Too much jaw,
too much job.

3677
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:19,580
Like there's a lot of variables.
We don't like long hair.

3678
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:20,960
Long hair doesn't bother me.
Shorter.

3679
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:23,180
Short doesn't and bottom either.
Either one's okay.

3680
02:47:23,400 --> 02:47:26,660
Like those characteristics.
We have a lot of room.

3681
02:47:26,661 --> 02:47:27,530
Oh,
she has curls.

3682
02:47:27,531 --> 02:47:28,760
Okay.
Who gives a fuck?

3683
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:30,140
Dreadlocks.
Whatever.

3684
02:47:30,141 --> 02:47:31,190
Who Cares?
She shaved her head.

3685
02:47:31,220 --> 02:47:32,070
Does she look good?
Yeah.

3686
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:36,200
You know what I mean?
But like a big judge.

3687
02:47:36,201 --> 02:47:37,700
He got a big job.
Fuck that.

3688
02:47:37,730 --> 02:47:38,180
Fuck.

3689
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:39,590
That.
Can't deal with that.

3690
02:47:39,591 --> 02:47:42,750
Look like that.
Look for whatever reason that looked

3691
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:44,510
freaks us out.
Like the hair.

3692
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:46,040
It's like inconsequential because it's
not.

3693
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:48,680
It's a part of you sorta,
but you cut it.

3694
02:47:48,681 --> 02:47:50,900
You don't even feel it.
It's kind of weird that it even grows in

3695
02:47:50,901 --> 02:47:53,300
the first place.
Kind of weird lion's mane.

3696
02:47:53,301 --> 02:47:55,100
Are you growing off the top of your
fucking head?

3697
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:56,173
It's weird.
Right?

3698
02:47:56,560 --> 02:48:00,260
So we don't care if all the variables.
Girls can have pink hair and shit,

3699
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:00,861
you know?
Yeah.

3700
02:48:00,861 --> 02:48:02,630
They get dick with any color hair right
now.

3701
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:03,920
Yeah.
But not with a big jaw.

3702
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:06,680
No.
Fucked up shoulders.

3703
02:48:06,681 --> 02:48:08,800
I think shoulders.
Job is going to be the next one too.

3704
02:48:08,810 --> 02:48:11,270
Big.
Bigger shoulders like Tommy hearns type

3705
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:13,250
shoulder.
Intimidating.

3706
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:15,420
Like some Lennox Lewis shoulders.
Yeah.

3707
02:48:15,900 --> 02:48:17,480
Yeah.
You don't one time like when she's

3708
02:48:17,481 --> 02:48:19,310
wearing her purse and it's like a right
by her ear.

3709
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:22,980
Maybe you want to conquer though.
You don't call.

3710
02:48:23,230 --> 02:48:25,100
I've had those.
I've had those.

3711
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:29,150
Yeah.
I've had some big chicks like gangster

3712
02:48:29,151 --> 02:48:32,030
bitches that are fine and cool and is
fucking ruthless.

3713
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:35,750
Got To be real careful when you grow up
and kick your ass or maybe you can kick

3714
02:48:35,751 --> 02:48:39,050
your ass or at least hold her own.
Watch your p's and q's.

3715
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:41,690
I got with the stripper once.
I was like six,

3716
02:48:41,691 --> 02:48:43,400
three.
Oh my God.

3717
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:45,500
Yeah.
She played volleyball and swam.

3718
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:48,440
Wow.
And Oh man,

3719
02:48:48,680 --> 02:48:49,513
I don't.
I mean,

3720
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:50,840
I'm,
I'm average sized,

3721
02:48:50,841 --> 02:48:54,290
you know,
but I got manhandled

3722
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:59,920
like I was young,
we were play wrestling and I was just

3723
02:48:59,921 --> 02:49:01,340
like,
thrown in like,

3724
02:49:01,370 --> 02:49:02,090
fuck.
Yeah.

3725
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:04,190
I just kept my cool with that girl.
Wow.

3726
02:49:04,910 --> 02:49:07,070
She was much stronger than you and it
was awesome.

3727
02:49:09,380 --> 02:49:12,300
Was like,
it was like an extra pump.

3728
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:15,970
It was weird.
Damn.

3729
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:18,000
She'd be my vein pop out or you're
getting excited.

3730
02:49:18,830 --> 02:49:20,210
Oh,
I remember that bitch.

3731
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:25,380
That's super athletes.
Yeah.

3732
02:49:25,730 --> 02:49:28,030
Like NBA player.
If you get a dobby,

3733
02:49:28,040 --> 02:49:30,330
an NBA player to meet with an NBA
player,

3734
02:49:30,480 --> 02:49:32,550
what kind of super athletes would you
get?

3735
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:34,140
Like,
good Lord.

3736
02:49:34,220 --> 02:49:36,420
Yeah know.
Or you know who I met.

3737
02:49:36,421 --> 02:49:40,050
That's a super athlete.
What does that volleyball player woman's

3738
02:49:40,051 --> 02:49:41,550
name.
She's very attractive.

3739
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:43,380
This is like a,
the one that.

3740
02:49:43,630 --> 02:49:44,850
Yes.
Gabrielle Reece.

3741
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:46,350
She's,
she's huge,

3742
02:49:46,590 --> 02:49:47,850
giant,
super athlete.

3743
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,540
If you could get her and made her up
with a brock Lesnar,

3744
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:55,410
how are you kidding me?
What kind of super athlete would you do

3745
02:49:55,411 --> 02:49:59,070
if you could get Gabrielle Reece and
Brock Lesnar and make them together?

3746
02:49:59,790 --> 02:50:01,200
Shaquille o'neal.
Lisa.

3747
02:50:01,201 --> 02:50:02,650
Leslie?
Yes.

3748
02:50:03,570 --> 02:50:05,790
Super Athletes.
You know,

3749
02:50:07,210 --> 02:50:10,360
there's some fucking super athletes out
there in the world too.

3750
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:13,030
There's so many athletes that are just.
You just go,

3751
02:50:13,031 --> 02:50:14,170
what?
How is that?

3752
02:50:14,650 --> 02:50:16,600
How is that even a person?
How's that person?

3753
02:50:16,700 --> 02:50:18,740
How is that the same thing as me?
You know?

3754
02:50:18,850 --> 02:50:20,890
It's the way their bread now,
the way they're taught,

3755
02:50:20,891 --> 02:50:22,750
that way they're coached.
It's crazy.

3756
02:50:22,751 --> 02:50:25,230
There's like kids that are 13 years old
taking creatine,

3757
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:25,931
my friends,
Hey,

3758
02:50:25,931 --> 02:50:28,040
can you get money from my son's team and
he's 13.

3759
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,160
Oh,
you're giving this kid create a teen.

3760
02:50:30,250 --> 02:50:33,280
I wonder if that's even healthy.
That's probably an unhealthy.

3761
02:50:33,490 --> 02:50:36,250
I don't even think 13 year old kids are
supposed to be lifting weights.

3762
02:50:36,251 --> 02:50:38,650
Right?
They're only supposed to do like a

3763
02:50:38,830 --> 02:50:42,640
calisthenics and things like that.
Like they think that weight itself can

3764
02:50:42,641 --> 02:50:45,700
actually fuck with their bone growth
because their bodies aren't designed to.

3765
02:50:47,020 --> 02:50:48,760
I wonder if that's been disproven.

3766
02:50:48,940 --> 02:50:50,350
I don't know.
I was just talking with my dad about

3767
02:50:50,351 --> 02:50:53,290
that the other day,
literally because there's a kid my age

3768
02:50:53,350 --> 02:50:55,810
that when we were growing up started
lifting a little earlier than everyone

3769
02:50:55,811 --> 02:50:57,400
else and he just all through high
school.

3770
02:50:57,401 --> 02:50:58,690
You fucked everyone up.
He was,

3771
02:50:58,691 --> 02:51:01,750
because he was that he had to write.
She was ahead of us all.

3772
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:06,280
He was a monster because of just because
of that and I don't think he would have

3773
02:51:06,281 --> 02:51:08,910
been smaller now than he was then.
He,

3774
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:09,841
his dad,
small.

3775
02:51:09,841 --> 02:51:11,050
He would have been small as whole life
anyway.

3776
02:51:11,240 --> 02:51:12,020
Maybe,
Huh?

3777
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:13,290
Yeah.
Who knows?

3778
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:15,590
I don't know if it's a bullshit meth or
not.

3779
02:51:15,591 --> 02:51:18,830
See if you can find out has the same
mill and they don't play,

3780
02:51:18,831 --> 02:51:20,780
but don't shoot the ball after you work
out.

3781
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:22,700
Don't shoot around and misses up your
jump shot.

3782
02:51:22,701 --> 02:51:23,201
That's.
No,

3783
02:51:23,201 --> 02:51:25,310
it's the best thing because you're
shooting tired.

3784
02:51:26,300 --> 02:51:27,560
There's some people that look at it that
way.

3785
02:51:27,980 --> 02:51:30,350
That's what they would say about archery
to.

3786
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:32,300
Shouldn't do archery after you lift
weights.

3787
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:33,410
Yeah.
Because,

3788
02:51:33,411 --> 02:51:35,450
um,
you don't want to have control of your

3789
02:51:35,451 --> 02:51:39,970
muscles and your muscles are fatigued.
It's harder to control fatigue game

3790
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:42,110
fourth quarter.
I see both.

3791
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:45,860
That was a philosophy and a lot of
Jujitsu schools you would do a lot of

3792
02:51:45,970 --> 02:51:47,780
calisthenics,
especially old school schools.

3793
02:51:48,110 --> 02:51:51,290
You do a lot of calisthenics and you'd
be fucking completely worn out before

3794
02:51:51,291 --> 02:51:53,480
you ever start sparring.
Oh,

3795
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:58,510
so before the beginning of class,
we push ups and hip scoots hip escapes

3796
02:51:58,610 --> 02:52:02,210
and go down the Mat and back.
He'd be doing while crab bear walks,

3797
02:52:02,211 --> 02:52:04,340
walk on your hands and feet,
that kind of shit,

3798
02:52:04,341 --> 02:52:08,350
and you get completely pushups,
sit ups and by burning you out with

3799
02:52:08,351 --> 02:52:10,390
calisthenics,
you were forced to use technique when

3800
02:52:10,391 --> 02:52:11,224
you rolled

3801
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:14,400
and then that you would spar.
After all that.

3802
02:52:14,510 --> 02:52:15,530
Yeah,
you would do technique,

3803
02:52:15,531 --> 02:52:17,360
you would do drills and then you'd wind
up sparring,

3804
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:20,390
but they don't.
Most places don't do it that way

3805
02:52:20,391 --> 02:52:22,520
anymore.
Most places believe the best way to

3806
02:52:22,521 --> 02:52:27,521
learn is actually just warm up.
Do drills go over the technical aspects

3807
02:52:27,831 --> 02:52:29,780
of it.
Then just spar hard and that you should

3808
02:52:29,781 --> 02:52:32,030
be fresh when you practice and
technique.

3809
02:52:32,180 --> 02:52:35,120
What does that saying?
This is an article from live strong and

3810
02:52:35,121 --> 02:52:36,620
I just went to dismissing the myths,

3811
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:41,880
get to the end of it,
and it basically says that lets you read

3812
02:52:41,890 --> 02:52:42,280
it.

3813
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:44,410
Okay.
Contrasts with suggestions of stunted

3814
02:52:44,411 --> 02:52:47,380
growth among young weightlifters.
Betsy Keller points out that

3815
02:52:47,381 --> 02:52:50,620
weightlifting may be more effective than
other forms of exercise in promoting

3816
02:52:50,621 --> 02:52:53,380
bone growth and density among
adolescents.

3817
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:55,090
Huh?
So it actually might be healthier for

3818
02:52:55,091 --> 02:52:56,890
them.
These researchers found that

3819
02:52:56,891 --> 02:53:00,910
testosterone injections increase both
bone length and density,

3820
02:53:00,911 --> 02:53:05,230
suggesting that weightlifting's impact
on testosterone may be beneficial.

3821
02:53:05,950 --> 02:53:08,710
Huh?
Veterans Administration Medical Center

3822
02:53:08,711 --> 02:53:13,000
supports evidence in 2008 study.
Interesting.

3823
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:16,910
It says it might allow you to grow
taller than you would have.

3824
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:18,280
Hm.
Interesting.

3825
02:53:19,460 --> 02:53:20,293
Hmm.

3826
02:53:20,820 --> 02:53:22,890
Interesting.
Yeah.

3827
02:53:22,891 --> 02:53:24,550
Who knows man,
but you wouldn't want to fuck your kid

3828
02:53:24,551 --> 02:53:25,261
up.
You know.

3829
02:53:25,261 --> 02:53:26,540
That's the thing.
Like,

3830
02:53:26,550 --> 02:53:30,420
I've seen people that have their kids
totally jacked at an early age.

3831
02:53:30,421 --> 02:53:31,230
I'm like,
boy.

3832
02:53:31,230 --> 02:53:33,000
Again,
like how much pressure you put on that

3833
02:53:33,001 --> 02:53:34,410
little guy?
Is that what he wants to do?

3834
02:53:34,470 --> 02:53:35,870
Your kid wants to do squats.
Yeah.

3835
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:38,620
I kinda think they don't.
Fuck.

3836
02:53:38,990 --> 02:53:40,980
I had all that pressure on me,
man.

3837
02:53:41,170 --> 02:53:43,530
I'm probably used to wake me up like in
sixth grade.

3838
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:44,960
Come on,
walk.

3839
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,560
You're going to go watch the freshmen
practice.

3840
02:53:46,561 --> 02:53:48,990
I was like,
why do I gotta go to this practice?

3841
02:53:50,310 --> 02:53:51,300
Older brothers,
man.

3842
02:53:51,301 --> 02:53:54,150
Make tough kids though.
Do you look at a kid who was like the

3843
02:53:54,151 --> 02:53:56,280
youngest brother has got a bunch of
brothers at fuck with them.

3844
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:59,460
Those dudes usually not a handle
themselves because you'd grown up in a

3845
02:53:59,461 --> 02:54:02,100
combat situation.
Your brothers are fucking with you

3846
02:54:02,101 --> 02:54:03,750
constantly have.
We're all yet.

3847
02:54:03,780 --> 02:54:07,230
We're all a year apart.
That's terrible.

3848
02:54:08,670 --> 02:54:09,630
That's chaos.

3849
02:54:10,370 --> 02:54:13,010
It's that little Hercules' guy from a
couple of years ago.

3850
02:54:13,160 --> 02:54:15,060
Yeah.
That's what he looks like now.

3851
02:54:15,090 --> 02:54:17,550
You grew up and gave up on him.
He gave up on lifting weights

3852
02:54:18,100 --> 02:54:19,720
inside edition story on him last year.

3853
02:54:19,910 --> 02:54:20,743
Poor little guy.

3854
02:54:21,400 --> 02:54:22,270
So it looked like

3855
02:54:23,330 --> 02:54:25,980
those myostatin inhibitor things or
maybe or.

3856
02:54:26,090 --> 02:54:27,280
No,
they don't have that.

3857
02:54:27,281 --> 02:54:32,281
Like in terms of like a supplement w w,
some people born with mild stat

3858
02:54:32,591 --> 02:54:35,290
inhibitors and makes a grow much more
muscle.

3859
02:54:35,291 --> 02:54:37,660
You bought as or regulate the growth of
muscle the way ours does.

3860
02:54:38,340 --> 02:54:41,900
What do you mean some,
it's some weird genetic freak that they

3861
02:54:41,901 --> 02:54:46,901
found in dogs called whippets and some
cows that somehow or another,

3862
02:54:47,141 --> 02:54:49,750
when they're breeding these dogs,
they uh,

3863
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:54,780
they develop this genetic variation in
what's called a milestone and inhibitor.

3864
02:54:55,060 --> 02:54:58,390
And it allows for some strange reason,
like there's a real dog,

3865
02:54:58,900 --> 02:55:03,900
this is a whippet that has this mild
staten inhibitor issue and these are

3866
02:55:03,921 --> 02:55:06,800
some cows that have a two.
And what it is is they just grow way

3867
02:55:06,801 --> 02:55:08,870
more muscle.
So look at the size of that cow.

3868
02:55:08,910 --> 02:55:09,920
It's incredible.
Right?

3869
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:13,580
So they figured out how to do it in
mice.

3870
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:17,760
Like they figured out how to introduce
these genes to mice and they develop

3871
02:55:17,761 --> 02:55:19,700
these mice.
They live longer,

3872
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:22,670
they are much more muscular,
they have more endurance.

3873
02:55:22,671 --> 02:55:25,220
That's what their bodies look like.
Yeah.

3874
02:55:25,670 --> 02:55:30,670
So really kind of fascinating because it
points to this idea that these little

3875
02:55:31,911 --> 02:55:35,030
animals through this myostatin inhibitor
are like super animals.

3876
02:55:35,031 --> 02:55:37,670
They become like super mys.
Like that's what it looked like.

3877
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:40,280
Look at that little one on the right
with all the muscles.

3878
02:55:40,281 --> 02:55:42,620
It's crazy man.
Second Simone Mouse.

3879
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:48,020
It's like a David Tula stacked up mouse.
George.

3880
02:55:48,021 --> 02:55:50,700
We just did three hours man too.
That it's over.

3881
02:55:50,750 --> 02:55:52,130
Hey,
it was fun.

3882
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:54,040
Great Stories,
man.

3883
02:55:54,060 --> 02:55:54,611
Thank you.
Didn't.

3884
02:55:54,611 --> 02:55:56,890
We didn't even tell all of them,
but there was a gang of them.

3885
02:55:56,910 --> 02:55:58,280
You were telling the store will have to
do it again.

3886
02:55:58,440 --> 02:56:01,460
Yeah,
you educate me like crazy right now.

3887
02:56:01,730 --> 02:56:04,640
I was just talking with fun man.
And uh,

3888
02:56:04,641 --> 02:56:07,690
you're going to be in Bria next weekend.
Yeah.

3889
02:56:07,710 --> 02:56:11,210
So what's the date?
Is October 29th and October 30th.

3890
02:56:11,370 --> 02:56:13,970
Me and red band or doing the late shows
at the Improv.

3891
02:56:14,030 --> 02:56:16,250
Beautiful.
Bright Improv is the shit that should be

3892
02:56:16,251 --> 02:56:17,440
a really funny show.
Yeah.

3893
02:56:17,441 --> 02:56:18,980
It's funny dude.
Redmond's funding.

3894
02:56:18,981 --> 02:56:20,950
So that should be a great time.
Thanks for coming brother.

3895
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:22,400
Really appreciate it.
It was a lot of fun.

3896
02:56:22,830 --> 02:56:24,440
All right folks.
We'll see you next week.

3897
02:56:24,470 --> 02:56:28,610
Bye Bye.
Three hours doing that shit.
