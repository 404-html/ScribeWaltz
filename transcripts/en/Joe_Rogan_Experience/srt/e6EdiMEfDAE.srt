Squarespace with squarespace.
Come a contest and gave away prizes.

37
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:07,131
It was actually really hard to do 
because there were so many good 

38
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,021
websites.
Squarespace is a website where anyone 

39
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:12,710
mean even me,
I could go to squarespace and make a 

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,710
website.
It's that easy.

41
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,760
It's super easy to do.
Just regular drag and drop shit.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
You don't have to know anything weird or
funky.

43
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,810
You don't have to know any bizarre 
terms.

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,330
They make it very easy for you to do.
They have beautiful designs to pretty to

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,170
start with and you don't even have to 
enter your credit card.

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,020
If you go to squarespace.com,
you can sign up,

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,660
try it out,
and then if you decide you'd like it and

48
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,660
you're impressed by what you can make,
then you enter your credit card.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,780
They do that because they're extremely 
confident in what they're producing.

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,810
Squarespace is a beautiful website.
I mean,

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,020
the websites that people created,
they were fucking magical man.

52
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,510
That one,
that storm chasers one I've still visit.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,840
I have bookmarked that one just to,
just to check out the storms.

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,810
Amazing Shit.
They also have it set up so you can have

55
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,360
an online store,
very easy,

56
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,400
like really quickly to do.
And you also,

57
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,300
if you're a musician or if you,
uh,

58
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,720
make some sort of audio files,
if you have a podcast that someone would

59
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:06,721
actually pay for 'em,
you could actually sell musical digital 

60
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:09,340
downloads from the website.
Simple drag and drop stuff.

61
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,210
They offer 24 slash seven support.

70
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:41,950
as essentially a human optimization 
website.

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,790
The way we sell things out of it,
I just sell everything I use.

72
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,410
If I use kettlebells,
we sell that.

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,630
We find good coffee.
We sell that.

74
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,730
If we find good coconut oil,
we,

75
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,731
if we find excellent protein powder,
whatever we find that we feel is 

76
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:00,370
beneficial and has science behind it.
We also post all the science behind it.

77
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:05,371
We're also doing ongoing studies,
double blind placebo studies on several 

78
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,121
different products.
We want to make sure that none of this 

79
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,241
is Malarkey,
so go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t 

80
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:15,310
use the Codeword Rogan and save 10

guarantee on these supplements.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,970
If you just think it's bullshit,
you don't have to return it,

83
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,340
you get your money back.
We're not trying to rip you off.

84
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:26,500
We're just trying to sell you shit that 
you're going to benefit from it.

85
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:31,501
Are you going to want to buy again and 
the best way to make you want to buy it 

86
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:34,171
again?
Let's make it as even in just clean as 

87
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:34,171
possible.
Hey,

88
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,830
my roommate buys that shit and he came 
and afford it.

89
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,840
Shroom tech is awesome.
I haven't tried it yet,

90
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,640
but he,
he buys it and he can't afford it,

91
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,410
so yeah,
I'm pissed that I forgot to bring it for

92
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,780
you because I'm going to try it for 
endurance.

93
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,470
There's not.
I mean,

94
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,650
I love alphabet as well,
but for adherence,

95
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,660
shroom tech is fucking,
but I will say that Roger was on Alpha 

96
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:51,940
brain and I still beat him up.
This is true.

97
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,760
This is true.
That was a good fight for you.

98
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,290
All right.
On a.com

99

Paul boom war machine is here.
Cue The music.

101
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,690
Real good experience

102
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,870
Joe Rogan podcast.

103
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,370
Ladies and gentlemen,
powerful war machine.

104
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,140
Let's go buddy.
How are you man?

105
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,280
Good man.
I'm happy to be here.

106
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,470
Happy to have you man.
We,

107
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,060
you and I have been friends for a long 
time.

108
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Know you from when you first entered 
into the UFC and all through your 

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,770
various legal difficulties in troubles.
We've always remained friendly.

110
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:31,310
So,
uh,

111
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,620
I was happy to have you on here man.
And sit down and talk to you.

112
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,800
And I think people have a fucked up 
opinion of you.

113
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:41,801
That's,
it's hard to form an opinion on someone 

114
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,500
based on them getting arrested based on 
internet battle.

115
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,000
No,
Amanda,

116
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,350
I get all the time.
I get.

117
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I get it.
We're all be out somewhere at an after 

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,360
party and meeting people and they'll be 
like,

119
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,370
hey,
you know what man?

120
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:51,170
Like I feel bad man.
You know,

121
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:56,171
I'm one of those.
I'm one of those guys that always 

122
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:56,171
talking shit about you online and act.
I feel guilty,

123
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:56,200
you know,
nobody,

124
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't worry about it.
You,

125
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,680
we're just,
just,

126
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,060
right now I'm,

127
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
I'm trying to anchor towards Jim and the
new coach or there's Robert Follis and 

128
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,310
I'd never met him before.
He's a great guy.

129
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,240
I liked him.
He,

130
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:10,241
nobody.
When I first got there before I was 

131
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:10,241
coming,
someone said,

132
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:10,241
hey,
why don't you start coming?

133
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:10,241
He's like,
oh,

134
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:10,720
well we'll see about that.
Like,

135
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,990
you know,
I'll give them a trial run,

136
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:12,510
you know,
and like,

137
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,600
you know,
because you believe the rumors in him.

138
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,090
He met me now every day he's like,
I'm so glad to have you here,

139
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:17,870
man.
You train hard.

140
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:18,670
You're a good guy.
You know,

141
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,880
like,
but he doesn't know that.

142
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,500
I know that he used to not like me.
No,

143
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,410
but I get a lot of flack for my 
shenanigans and uh,

144
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,440
because it's blown out of proportion in 
a lot of things,

145
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:27,740
you know?
Well,

146
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,320
it's definitely,
some of it's blown out of proportion,

147
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,130
but then,
you know,

148
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,750
you actually did some shit.

149
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,000
You did wind up going to jail for 
beating the fuck out of.

150
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,890
Some people got a little crazy a few 
times,

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,930
but I mean that's normal human stuff.
You know,

152
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,340
like everyone gets in fights.
I mean I'm driving here today and an old

153
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,440
lady was flipped me off on the side,
you know,

154
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,470
cutting me off.
You know,

155
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,870
people are violent,
you know,

156
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,190
it's,
it does happen.

157
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,450
It's a natural thing to get into a 
fight.

158
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,920
You know,
it does happen,

159
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:52,860
but I'm,
what I'm saying is like,

160
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,810
it's not just,
you definitely are a good marketer.

161
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,530
You definitely put your shenanigans out 
there to get people excited about it and

162
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,660
a lot of talk.
I mean it's,

163
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,120
it works.
You mean your twitter feeds very active,

164
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,170
you know,
whether it's people hating on you or 

165
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,170
not.
Yeah.

166
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,170
I have no filter,
you know,

167
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,170
and it works good.

168
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,090
Like people know who I am and I have a 
fan fans gives it,

169
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,420
but also I'm,
I'm kind of on the black edge,

170
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:15,370
but you know what I mean?
Uh,

171
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,180
some people won't touch me.
Yeah,

172
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,980
I'm sure like sponsors and stuff.
Yeah.

173
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,740
That.
Or even if I was in the UFC right now,

174
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:26,741
I'd be fired everyday probably.
I was thinking that when I started the 

175
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,250
blowjob tweet think they would let you 
get away with.

176
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,430
I'd be fired every single day.
Why?

177
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,120
Not Really?
In my opinion,

178
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,160
who cares?
As long as you're not hurting anybody.

179
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,430
It's one thing.
We were also talking before the show 

180
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,520
started about Tiago Silva.
You where you got a really good point.

181
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,920
Like Tiago Silva should've never left 
Brazil.

182
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah.
Because you could act like that out of 

183
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Brazil.
Well,

184
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:47,980
you know what?
Here's the way I see it.

185
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,420
Bring a man from 19 thirties a,
not a criminal,

186
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,370
a regular guy,
you know,

187
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,740
a lawful citizens and let him live 
today.

188
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Guess what?
He's gonna go to jail because there's so

189
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,880
many strict laws now and everything's 
different,

190
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,300
so you can't.
You can't be raised with one set of 

191
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,030
morals and guidelines and then come live
now when you can't do anything and we 

192
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,241
don't want to give the wrong impression 
about Brazil because I love Brazil and 

193
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:10,241
I'm a.
I'm a huge fan of Brazil.

194
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,780
I think Rio is like one of the greatest 
cities in the world,

195
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,610
Annapolis,
but I've never been.

196
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,120
But the bottom line is Brazilian people 
didn't more relaxed about the way they 

197
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,360
do business.
They're more relaxed about the.

198
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,250
I mean,
they're very aggressive men too.

199
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,950
I mean there's a reason why the UFC and 
mma,

200
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:32,150
like all of it originated Valley Tudo 
originated out of Brazil.

201
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:37,151
Sure.
There was fights going on all over the 

202
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:37,151
world.
There always has been.

203
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,750
But Brazil has a very special 
relationship with violence.

204
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,780
It's a third world country.
Yeah.

205
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,300
So,
I mean,

206
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,770
the police,
I don't know if it is anymore.

207
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,550
No,
no.

208
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:43,930
Uh,
the,

209
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,450
the economy of Brazil has boomed so much
over the last decade.

210
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,320
Apparently they discovered oil offshore 
and resale and.

211
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:56,321
Yeah.
And there's a bunch of other economic 

212
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:56,520
factors that have led their economies 
like very strong right now.

213
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,690
It's actually,
they're probably,

214
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,860
you know,
they,

215
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,910
they,
they're probably one of the biggest 

216
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,391
growth countries over the past few years
based on the United States is made with 

217
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,290
this treatise country of own violence.
Like did a,

218
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,470
like fights when I was in England,
people were getting into bar fights and 

219
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,710
the cops came and broke it up.
No one to jail.

220
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,390
It was like,
oh,

221
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,990
Paul daily,
what do you beat that guy up?

222
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,880
And he got what?
What happens if he's not in jail?

223
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,220
Right.
I went to jail.

224
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,570
Who did Paul Bailey daily beat up some 
guy in a bar fight.

225
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,290
Remember he lost,
he lost his visa.

226
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,630
He couldn't fight in Bellatore.
Oh,

227
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,170
I didn't know.
That's why he lost his visa and me like,

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,570
I got a bar fight with the 300 pound guy
a year in jail.

229
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,460
Four times,
you know,

230
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,180
he's in.
It wasn't his first offense.

231
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,310
He had multiple offenses and no jail 
time,

232
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:35,930
you know.
Well,

233
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,870
you know,
they look at,

234
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,940
you got a hand grenade tattooed on your 
neck.

235
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,510
You got,
what does it say on your knuckles?

236
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,130
Dga.
I don't give a fuck.

237
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,030
I mean,
come on man.

238
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Hey,
if,

239
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,610
if I didn't know you,
I would assume like this guys are paid,

240
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:52,140
but if you watch problem he watched on 
youtube the first case.

241
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,850
It's on the screens.
Cameras.

242
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,040
They're my best friends.
Navy seal.

243
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,920
He starts the whole fight.
He beats up everybody.

244
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,770
I don't jump into.
He gets jumped and I'm the only one they

245
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,430
even got arrested.

246
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,910
So you got arrested just because it 
would make publicity and I think 

247
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,910
because.
All right,

248
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,180
are we going to charge a navy seal that 
just won a bronze medal?

249
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,210
Bronze Star or just wild maniac warmer 
sheet who did porn and I kicked out of 

250
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,310
the use and that is don't give a fuck.
Tattooing.

251
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,070
It's like they're not going to get the 
war hero because my friend's mom was 

252
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,070
like,
Hey Ryan,

253
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,330
how come John is going to jail?
You did everything.

254
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,800
That's not fair.
And Ryan's like,

255
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,380
we don't know.
You know,

256
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,740
whatever it happens,
you know?

257
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,870
But that's.
Well listen man,

258
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,890
you know,
because I know if you're in the wrong 

259
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:32,890
place,
the wrong time,

260
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:32,890
anything can happen.
That's why I don't go out anymore.

261
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,050
Do period smart.
I can't.

262
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,410
I can't risk it,
which is smart and we're also not trying

263
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,150
to make light of what happened with 
Tiago Silva.

264
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,310
I don't know the specifics.
I don't know the rules.

265
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:41,930
I don't.
I don't know.

266
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:45,240
I mean or rather the facts.
I don't know if he had a weapon.

267
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:50,241
I don't know what the fuck happened.
I don't even remember much different 

268
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:50,241
rumors.
Yeah,

269
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:51,630
but I liked that guy.
The way he fights.

270
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,250
He's,
he's a bad motherfucker.

271
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,630
He said dangerous too.
It's tough.

272
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,730
But you know what the.
I know the one thing for sure it was a 

273
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,240
woman was involved and people go crazy 
with their wife,

274
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:03,280
women's involved so that anyone is 
acceptable.

275
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,950
Susceptible to going crazy when the 
white one,

276
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:07,770
the one that loves involved so it 
doesn't excuse it,

277
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,420
but who knows what happened,
you know,

278
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,380
who knows?
Yeah.

279
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,530
It's apparently it's his ex wife and I 
don't know what the story was,

280
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:18,531
but apparently there was an armed 
standoff that was with the take the 

281
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:18,540
papers and all the press was reporting.

282
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,010
I don't know if there was any weapons 
involved.

283
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,320
I really have no idea.
But it sucks,

284
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,770
that guy's gone now,
you know,

285
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,910
he was a great fighter in the UFC there.
He's never going to fight in the UFC 

286
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,160
again.
And uh,

287
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,210
it,
it sucks if whatever he did actually 

288
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,401
happen,
it sucks way more for the people that 

289
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:37,401
were as victims of,
of course.

290
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,880
But it just sucks that a guy like that,
I can't keep it together,

291
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,090
you know,
especially if you're a fan of the sport 

292
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,090
and you're like watching them fight 
their guys.

293
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,160
You always know you're going to have a 
fun fight with.

294
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,760
That guy was in there.
I was,

295
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,420
I enjoyed watching them because I was.
Yeah,

296
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:52,410
but that your point about like a guy 
like that growing up in Brazil,

297
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,140
you know,
growing up,

298
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:56,620
kind of wild coming over here and 
everybody is so conservative,

299
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,130
so much.

300
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,370
So many laws and so much buttoned down 
on behavior.

301
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,980
You read about England to man,
they,

302
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,120
they,
Doug Stanhope has a whole bit about it.

303
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,020
A lot of countries,
man.

304
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,930
I mean a lot of countries fight as long 
as it's one on one.

305
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,070
Hey,
that's cool.

306
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,050
You know,
there's no,

307
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,340
nothing can happen,
but America is strict.

308
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,780
It's no joke with that stuff.
Yeah.

309
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,510
It's rarely hear about UFC fighters 
getting in fights though.

310
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,980
If you look at,
it's really pretty,

311
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,050
pretty amazing in comparison.
Like,

312
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,750
like,
you know,

313
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,140
Badr Hari that motherfuckers always 
getting in trouble,

314
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,340
you know,
which is another terrible situation 

315
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,380
because he's like one of the most 
exciting kickboxers on the planet.

316
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,390
Love watching that guy fight.
But he's always in trouble.

317
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:32,640
He,
you know,

318
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,720
he had to go to Morocco for awhile and,
and,

319
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,890
and,
and hide.

320
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,250
And then he came back and he had to deal
with this issue and then a new issue 

321
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:41,250
came up.

322
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:41,800
Some dude got his legs stomped at a 
club.

323
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,890
You know,
I think it happens more than we think.

324
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,700
I think that,
uh,

325
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,770
people don't,
they just get lucky to get away with it.

326
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,280
I'm the worst because I have,
I've had two twins,

327
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,070
tattoos.
I'm screwed.

328
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,350
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

329
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,320
Because they're like,
oh,

330
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,280
what happened?
There was a fight.

331
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,380
A guy had a grenade on his neck.
All this,

332
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,110
punch that into the computer.
You know what I'm going to do,

333
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,920
it doesn't matter,
you know,

334
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,710
but uh,
you know,

335
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,690
someone else maybe no tattoos.
It was a white guy.

336
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,130
He was kind of most,
I don't know,

337
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,510
unless you,
unless you recognize them,

338
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,320
you know?
Yeah.

339
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,510
And well,
I'm glad you're deciding to stay in now.

340
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,630
I have to keep away.
Jail Sucks.

341
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,340
I'm sure dude was.
I was in the whole,

342
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,330
you know,
it was boring.

343
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,690
Did they put you in solitary while the,
uh,

344
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:23,691
the first year I did,
my first six months was in the regular 

345
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:23,750
and then uh,
after that I got in an argument with,

346
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,080
with the sergeant and then one of the 
cops,

347
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,370
hey man,
that guy's a UFC fighter,

348
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,570
whatever.
If it's a walk my,

349
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,400
he should be,
he shouldn't be in general population.

350
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,110
They put me in the holding the last six 
months.

351
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Why?
It's just because you're a UFC there 

352
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,200
saying like,
well,

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,960
how come I know that he could have 
ordered people to attack me or another 

354
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:39,960
inmate?
So he put me in the hole.

355
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,690
Then the second year when I went to 
jail,

356
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:45,691
the whole year in Vegas,
I was in the whole the whole time 

357
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:45,691
because they already knew I wasn't just 
stuck me in there.

358
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,960
Wow.
For how long were you in the hall?

359
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,420
The whole year?

360
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,510
The second year.
The whole year by yourself.

361
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,290
What?
You know,

362
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,400
what,
it sounds bad,

363
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:56,401
but it's kind of better because there's 
no chance to get in trouble for me at 

364
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:57,470
least.
I don't know,

365
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,610
like after a whole,
you know,

366
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,700
you get aggravated one day and then 
there's those guys in our fake tough 

367
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,410
guys and they want to be jerks and 
there's always a little politics.

368
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,300
You get in one little fight and next 
thing you know,

369
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,130
I'm back in jail for,
for who knows how long,

370
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:14,131
you know.
So especially depending upon what 

371
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,700
happens because I was in jail in San 
Diego when I was in the mainland still.

372
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,540
And these guys were playing chess or 
pushups and uh,

373
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,330
it was a little Asian guy looked at him.
He was actually from mom,

374
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,040
Burma.
Nice old man.

375
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,180
He was only in there because him and he 
had a wife and three kids and a tow 

376
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,190
truck driver was towing his car and he 
was like,

377
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,610
no,
no,

378
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:30,740
no.

379
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,000
Try and stop them until the car.
He pushed the driver so they put them in

380
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:34,900
jail for assault.
Right.

381
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,540
While she was in there,
he's playing chess with a,

382
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,700
with another guy and they bet 100 
pushups.

383
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,710
The Burmese guy,
he won and he goes,

384
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,210
Oh,
you pushups pushups?

385
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,200
And the guy's like,
Nah,

386
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,250
I ain't do shit.
And like,

387
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,500
oh no,
it's not fair.

388
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,890
You know,
like what?

389
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:49,960
What are you gonna do?
And starts punching the Burmese guy.

390
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,000
He hit him like three,
four times in the guy who a,

391
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,180
he closed his eyes,
one overhand right,

392
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,010
knocked the guy out,
the guy died,

393
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,750
the guy fell down,
hit his head.

394
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,660
They charged him with.
They charged him with murder and it's on

395
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:07,661
camera like,
you know damn well that was held fence 

396
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:09,720
charged him with murder.
I don't know what happened to that guy 

397
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:09,720
he was in.

398
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,900
He was in when I saw him in the hole,
he was there every day meditating.

399
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,660
He was the nicest old,
like he was probably like 45,

400
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:17,300
such a nice guy and that's a sad,
sad story,

401
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,090
you know,
and like,

402
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,930
and you know that that can happen.
And then he's,

403
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,540
he's,
you know,

404
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,190
he's Buddhist.
So he's brainwashed.

405
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,050
This is my Karma.
It's okay.

406
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,530
This is the plan for Godly accepting it,
man.

407
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,450
This is bullshit man.
Like I felt so bad.

408
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,580
It made me want to cry.
I felt bad for that guy.

409
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,730
Yeah.
There should be room in the system for 

410
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:36,730
reason.
Like with a guy like that.

411
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,230
It should be a guy like that.
You should be able to pull the guy side 

412
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,230
and go,
what?

413
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,230
Tell me what happened,
man.

414
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,080
What's your version of the story?
See that?

415
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,260
And they should be like this.
No,

416
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,780
just don't do this again.

417
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,310
And we're cool.
You just don't hit anybody,

418
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,640
you know,
call the authorities if you have to toe,

419
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,820
toe,
toe touch people.

420
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,830
And the guy would probably be like,
it'll never happen again.

421
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,440
And then you're good.
You don't have to put a guy like that in

422
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:55,410
a cage.
Well,

423
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,290
you know,
I was reading,

424
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,810
reading like all these surveys and stuff
and articles,

425
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:04,811
but they were saying that like we,
we have more people in jail than any 

426
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:09,311
country by far by far.
Like we incarcerate people five times 

427
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:09,770
more than England and then end a second,
second place.

428
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,070
We have more prisoners in California and
the whole country of Canada and the 

429
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,110
crime rates are the same.
So why is everyone in jail?

430
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:15,930
You know,
I don't understand it.

431
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,060
It's a business,
but will,

432
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,690
that is the thing that is,
that's a crazy thing to admit and it's a

433
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,370
crazy thing to talk about because most 
people,

434
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,450
it sounds so unreasonable.

435
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,850
It sounds like conspiracy theory.
It sounds like you're saying that.

436
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,770
Oh,
I can George Bush plan nine slash 11 and

437
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:29,420
almost sounds the same thing.
The prisons,

438
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,300
they make profit off of putting people 
in jail.

439
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,860
What do you want to charge me for a 
stamped envelope?

440
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,480
It was like eighty nine cents for 
stamped envelope.

441
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,700
Do stats forty four cents.
And how much does the envelope?

442
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,310
They're taxed you and everything.
Everything's taxed a lot.

443
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,990
It's like selling drugs better than 
drugs.

444
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,090
Well,
that's just what's going on for that,

445
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,700
but the actually the private prisons are
getting paid.

446
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,720
You get paid by the government,
by the government to the amount of 

447
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,100
prisoners that they have is directly 
proportionate to what they get paid.

448
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,300
Yeah.
And then I was reading,

449
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,620
um,
that's crazy.

450
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,270
I was reading an old stats,
right?

451
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,440
So they said,
okay,

452
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:01,910
a,
a year in jail,

453
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,950
cost to the state,
$55,000

454
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,690
something dollars for a year,
right.

455
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,310
A year.
And um,

456
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,090
uh,
what's called house arrest costs $5,000.

457
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,740
House arrest your half is likely to 
receive,

458
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,400
to do new crime.
Right.

459
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,880
So they know that it's a fact.
So why wouldn't you put the gun on house

460
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,010
arrest if it's only for a year and save 
space in jail,

461
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:22,660
you know,
because,

462
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,570
because you know,
what happens,

463
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,860
is that a year in jail,
it was like,

464
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,640
oh,
it's only a year.

465
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,510
Yeah.
But guess what,

466
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,490
you lost your job.
You lost your credit.

467
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,650
He lost her house,
she lost her car.

468
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,910
So you come out with nothing and then 
you're like,

469
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:33,980
all right man,
I wanted to do good,

470
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,950
but I'm going to do one more crime to 
get some money and then I'll.

471
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,440
Then I'll be straight again.
But when you on house arrest,

472
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,540
it's like a year.
You're still jail.

473
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,740
You can't do nothing.
Fun.

474
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,950
Jail to work or no home work,
home to work.

475
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,590
But at the end of that year you didn't 
lose your credit.

476
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:50,160
You didn't lose your house,
you didn't lose your car.

477
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
So you're like,
fuck,

478
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,190
I don't want to get in trouble again.
And,

479
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,450
but you,
you don't have to start from zero.

480
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,530
You still where you were,
you know,

481
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,930
but the government doesn't get paid when
you under house arrest,

482
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,250
25 grand,
you know,

483
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,330
instead of 55.
But it should work on what works better,

484
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,230
you know,
I don't know man.

485
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,380
It was jacked up system that was in 
there.

486
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,270
Well it's,
it's,

487
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,540
it's for profit system and any for 
profit system becomes an organism.

488
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,820
An organism is protect themselves.
And that's what they do.

489
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:19,821
I mean,
when you find out that prison guards 

490
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:22,100
lobby and the prison guard unions and 
they lobby to make sure that certain 

491
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,371
drug laws are in place,
they want certain drug laws in place to 

492
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:25,371
ensure that there's a certain amount of 
prisoners.

493
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,250
That's crazy,
man.

494
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,690
That's slavery.
That is,

495
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,370
that is fucking slave.
It is dude.

496
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:34,371
And,
and just like the same thing all across 

497
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:34,371
the,
you know,

498
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:36,780
the inner cities,
they're canceling afterschool programs 

499
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,471
and,
and all this stuff and they're building 

500
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:39,540
more juvenile halls.
What a coincidence.

501
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,540
So you're going to fuck in these inner 
city kids.

502
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,780
They're going to,
they're going to gang bang or they're 

503
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:47,780
gonna play sports.
You know what I mean?

504
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,960
That's a lot.
You hear the stories of these kids and 

505
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:50,960
why I play sports,
stay out of trouble.

506
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,740
Well now there's no sports.
When I'm a gang,

507
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,810
Bang,
now there's more juvenile halls and they

508
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,810
want that.
It's fucked up,

509
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:55,270
man.
Right?

510
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,490
If you were,
if you were trying to follow a 

511
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:00,490
conspiracy,
that would be the exact correct thing to

512
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,971
do to make sure there's more crime.
If you were going to try to prevent 

513
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:04,971
crime,
save lives,

514
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:05,360
you would do the exact opposite thing.

515
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,080
You wouldn't spend the money on juvenile
halls.

516
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:12,081
He had spent it on community centers.
You spend it on counselors spending on 

517
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:12,081
people.
Look,

518
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:16,730
I saw your story on pellets about your 
father dying when you were young and I 

519
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:23,061
grew up without my dad.
I haven't spoken to my dad since I was 

520
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,170
seven and I think that um,
a lot of young men,

521
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:28,840
especially growing up without any sort 
of father figure,

522
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,320
I can get it into a fuck load of 
trouble.

523
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,500
You can get so distorted and twisted.
It's like one of the easiest ways for a 

524
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,290
young man grew up fucked up to not have 
an example for sure.

525
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,620
We somehow or another we need,
we,

526
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,360
we like identifying,
we sort of like,

527
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,000
we connect with these examples.
Positive examples or negative examples.

528
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,290
Yeah.
And there's also the issue that a lot of

529
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,060
people deal with where,
you know,

530
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:54,900
yeah,
they're fucked up.

531
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,010
Yeah.
They're in trouble yet either.

532
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,530
But they grew up in a piece of shit 
household.

533
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,710
They grew up with an asshole for a dad.
They know we're not all starting from 

534
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,371
scratch,
like everybody's not starting on the 

535
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,501
same level.
Some people start the game at fucking 

536
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:09,501
homebase.
They're already done their one.

537
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,670
Their parents are rich,
everyone's friendly,

538
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,730
they're done.
And some people from the jump.

539
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:17,340
Your life has challenged from the jump.
It's this food,

540
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,310
there's poverty,
there's a,

541
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,340
there's a salt,
there's all sorts of shit that you're 

542
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,340
dealing with in your house on a regular 
basis.

543
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Like,
you know,

544
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,780
people say that,
you know,

545
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,560
I'm,
I'm a maniac,

546
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:27,780
right?
I'm more out there than most people.

547
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,260
But like,
I mean,

548
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,300
I don't like to complain about my life,
but for I turned out pretty good for 

549
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,410
considering,
you know what I mean?

550
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:39,411
And if it wasn't for me finding an 
outlet and weight lifting and sports and

551
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,000
all that stuff,
I would have been a maniac.

552
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,120
Well,
for sure,

553
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:43,710
you know?
Yeah.

554
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,500
I mean,
because you,

555
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,110
you,
you know,

556
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,190
you went through a lot of crazy shit for
sure,

557
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,220
but you've always been a good dude to 
talk to and that's one of the reasons 

558
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,950
why I wanted to have you on the podcast 
because that's where I think that people

559
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:58,951
get the wrong impression of you.
It's like a lot of people in the same 

560
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,710
circumstances have,
you would have turned out even worse and

561
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:06,880
that's the reality of life about knots.
We don't start off in the same place.

562
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,760
We don't even know what.
I was actually on a pretty good track.

563
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,980
My Dad died when I was 13.
I gave him CPR.

564
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:12,510
He died,
right?

565
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,850
So I went to live with my mom and she 
was a drug addict and my step dad's a 

566
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:17,850
drug addict.
The losers,

567
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,670
right?
It was a mess and I had no rules,

568
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:19,330
man.
I could do anything.

569
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:22,140
I wanted no rules,
but I want.

570
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,350
I found a gym I went to.

571
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,320
It was a little hole in the wall.
Jim's called mips gym and seeing value.

572
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,470
That's where I grew up,
but it was all like cops and 

573
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,870
firefighters and ex military.
And there's an old crusty navy seal,

574
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,110
his name's Jim Taylor.
He was like 55 x Vietnam Guy.

575
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,360
Right.
And he came be.

576
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,480
He became kind of like my dad.
So I was actually,

577
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,010
I pictured when I was in,
I was Jackson.

578
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,020
I was a kid bro.
Like I was like this in high school 

579
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,020
because I lifted weights,
I played sports,

580
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,080
I had all a's and b's,
you know,

581
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,610
I didn't get into.
I got in fights,

582
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:52,720
but that was it.
All good grades a all always sports.

583
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:54,700
I want to be a navy seal.
I went to the citadel for college.

584
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,790
I was a biology major and now you know,
I was doing everything good now sucked 

585
00:21:59,790 --> 00:21:59,790
it up.

586
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,950
I did everything right.
And then after my sophomore year I go to

587
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,300
the guidance counselor's office and 
they're like,

588
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:07,330
hey,
you go with $15,000

589
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:07,710
from,
from,

590
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,430
from this year.
I was like,

591
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,110
wow.
My mom gets my dad's pension.

592
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:13,420
He was a cop.
They get that money every month.

593
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,820
It turns out my mom spent all the money 
on drugs that's been on drugs and my 

594
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,360
stepdad's attorney,
because he did have a fraud case,

595
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:20,380
right?
So as,

596
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:20,890
hey,
they said,

597
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:23,110
well,
the navy wanted to give me a scholarship

598
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,720
for my last few years and commissioned 
me afterwards,

599
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,540
but they weren't going to back pay what 
I already over the 15 grand.

600
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:33,541
Right.
So they said we gotta either you've got 

601
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:33,541
to pay this or we got to freeze your 
credits.

602
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:33,690
And,
and I,

603
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,200
I couldn't even transfer my credits.
So I did.

604
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,220
I went into meltdown psychomotor because
I mean I sucked it up all that time and 

605
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,570
like didn't drink,
didn't do drugs,

606
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,490
trained,
did community service,

607
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,060
all that stuff.

608
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,680
Good grades.
And I went home,

609
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:49,540
dude.
And I beat my stepdad almost to death.

610
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,940
Almost killed him.
I beat him bad,

611
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:52,720
like there's blood on the ceiling.
I smacked him so bad.

612
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,520
And then like,
then I got arrested for like mayhem,

613
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,580
attempted murder,
all this stuff because I beat him so 

614
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:00,940
bad.
But I told the cop straight up,

615
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,420
I say,
man,

616
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,550
I said,
I told them.

617
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:06,010
The truth is my dad was an lapd cop.
I said he died and I was 13.

618
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,670
I started freaking busted my ass,
went to a military college of citadel.

619
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,560
I have all a's and b's,
biology major.

620
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,630
These fuckers spend my dad's money on 
drugs.

621
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
You know what I mean?
I came home and I asked him why he did 

622
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880
it and we got in a fight and I said I 
couldn't stop eating them.

623
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,620
That's what happened,
you know,

624
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,200
and the cop was there.
Sounds like self defense to me.

625
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,350
Saved my ass.
I would have been when you were 17 that 

626
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,380
then I was 20 or 20 points you.
I'm sorry.

627
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:29,860
You were,
you were,

628
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,770
you were when you went to college,
you were 17 or 18?

629
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,590
I was 18 when I went to freshman year.
So we use,

630
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,560
we stand at home during this time or 
Carolina at college,

631
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,140
but I'll come back to summers.
So they were out here?

632
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,580
Yeah,
they're out here in Simi Valley.

633
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,970
So you had no idea that they were 
spending your money?

634
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,010
They were paying for the

635
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,460
tuition

636
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,080
for sure.
What happened was when I was,

637
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,440
my dad died,
we all got his money every month after 

638
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,440
that when we were kids.
When I turned 18 kid in my name,

639
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,240
so my freshman year I paid the bills,
but it's a base.

640
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,500
It's like a college,
but it's a base.

641
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,820
You can't,
you can't really.

642
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,180
It's hard to handle the bills.
Say Mama,

643
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,040
I'm going to put it back into your name 
because you know,

644
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,120
just send the check every month.
Oh boy.

645
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,830
She fucked me over.
You know what I mean?

646
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,580
So I got out,
I was so pissed and I went,

647
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,340
I just went berserk mode.
I beat him up,

648
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,120
got in trouble,
and then that's when I packed my bags.

649
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,660
I moved to San Diego,
I went to the lion's den.

650
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,290
I said,
hey,

651
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,840
can I say I want to try out for the for 
you guys as team?

652
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,560
And he's like,
you,

653
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,170
you know,
I heard they have tryouts.

654
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Tells Tony Glendo days running.
Yeah.

655
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,670
Well Ken was there,
Tony Vernon,

656
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:29,840
white,
all those guys.

657
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:35,110
They said,
well the next trial is now for three 

658
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,110
months.
So I got a job.

659
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,110
I actually,
I got a job at a strip club,

660
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,910
pure platinum with a fake id.
I was only 20 and I had a 21 year Id.

661
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,180
I got a job,
was bounced down the Strip club and I 

662
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,180
was just going to bally's and running 
and lifting weights.

663
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,780
I don't know really how to train really,
you know what I mean?

664
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,050
And I went and tried out for the team 
and I made the team and that's how I 

665
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:50,050
started fighting.
Really?

666
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:50,050
Wow.

667
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,700
So you basically,
you were an angry dude but you were 

668
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,031
keeping it together and trying to do 
good and trying to stay positive and 

669
00:24:57,031 --> 00:25:00,211
this one event sent you into this 
fucking crazy spiral because that 

670
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:00,211
happened.

671
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,690
And then um,
actually when I first got home I still 

672
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:05,940
sucked it up.
I didn't beat him up yet.

673
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,040
I got home and I was just like,
furious.

674
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,500
And I was like trying to figure out a 
solution.

675
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,940
Right.
And actually,

676
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:12,560
uh,
my,

677
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,380
my brother's Po was,
he was on probation for,

678
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,600
for weed.
My little brother,

679
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,570
he came to the house and he's like,
hey,

680
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,460
we're sharing a room because I want to 
ask you some questions.

681
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,870
He's like,
is this yours?

682
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,700
Is his.
I said,

683
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,310
that's mine.
That's mine.

684
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,050
And there was like a plate with a knife 
on it,

685
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:27,360
like a kitchen plate was death.
And I said,

686
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:33,270
I want to do this.
Almost somebody was eating due to sign 

687
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,270
knife.
I was like,

688
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,270
it's my house was eating.
He goes,

689
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,270
all right.
And like,

690
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,420
and the cop goes,
uh,

691
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,860
you kind of have an attitude.

692
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,110
I said,
yeah man,

693
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I,
I don't really want to talk to right 

694
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,120
now.
You know what I mean?

695
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,120
What in your house?
Yeah,

696
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,120
what do you guys want?
I'm not on probation.

697
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,420
My brother is because you don't.
I'm gonna Search you.

698
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,130
I was like,
no,

699
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,650
no,
you're not.

700
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,490
He's like,
yeah,

701
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,080
animals are not me,
bro.

702
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,340
And he grabbed my wrist and I pull my 
wrist back and the all four jumped on me

703
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,910
did.
He jumped on me Bro.

704
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,150
And I was like holding my hands together
and they couldn't get me down.

705
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:56,320
They're pissed because I was jack that I
was struggling.

706
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,110
I could wrestle too,
you know,

707
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,670
and the dog down and I was like,
are you guys fucking serious?

708
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You have to fucking pussies.
They're fucking pitch.

709
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,300
Just clench your hands.
Gave me their fucking freaking out.

710
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:15,010
And it was wood floor and it was 
slippery.

711
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,300
Take down defense for dudes.
Even if they suck at wrestling because 

712
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,400
they are counteracting each other.
Um,

713
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,630
you know,
there's like,

714
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,920
you know what I mean?
They're helping me and really so 

715
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,940
funding.
I slipped and as you can have them,

716
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,980
you want to fucking.
They cuffed me and then they beat the 

717
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:35,980
fuck out of me.
Dude.

718
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,060
Once they cuffed to beat the shit,
I'm was like,

719
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,580
what are you guys doing?
That's Jonathan,

720
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:39,270
not Michael.
So

721
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,490
they knew I wasn't in,
so I still think nothing's going to 

722
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:44,490
happen.
They're gonna let me right,

723
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,990
fuck no.
They arrested me for assault.

724
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,470
Two counts of assault on a police 
officer resisting arrest.

725
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,620
They,
their story was that I came downstairs 

726
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,511
and said,
I'm Michael Down the Po knows my 

727
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:56,511
brother.
Like they lied.

728
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:57,690
Right.
So they scared me.

729
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,420
They scared me.
A didn't,

730
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,080
Diego's,
Oh,

731
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:06,081
we'll just plead guilty to a misdemeanor
resisting arrest and nothing will 

732
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:06,081
happen.
I said,

733
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:06,081
fine,
I'm fuck you.

734
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:10,281
Whatever.
I did it and then I get home and then I 

735
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:10,281
was just like,
good explore.

736
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:11,250
The whole time.
My Dad was a cop.

737
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,890
I was raised Republican.
Cops are good governments.

738
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:15,660
Good.
I wanted to be a navy seal.

739
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:16,950
I want to.
I love the country.

740
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,780
I said,
I never believed stories.

741
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:20,340
The cops fuck you up.
I thought my dad said,

742
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:21,670
that's a lie.
You know what I mean?

743
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,850
That's a lie.
The cops are the good guys.

744
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,340
My whole life is flipped upside down.
I said,

745
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,160
fuck this,
and I beat my step.

746
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,060
Dad's death.
That's what I find.

747
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:34,550
That's what I it the cops.
It was dirty cops for she to beat your 

748
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,200
Stepdad's head and that,
that,

749
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,120
that right there changed me.
If you,

750
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,190
if I knew myself as a kid,
I would hate myself.

751
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,930
I'll be like,
well,

752
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,750
she's a piece of shit.
He's an antiemetic.

753
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,690
I was so down for the country down for 
cops done for

754
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,840
if you knew yourself when you were 18 
years old,

755
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,150
when you knew you knew yourself of 
today.

756
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,460
Oh,
it hit me.

757
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,320
Wow.
I think I'm a piece of shit.

758
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,590
You know what I mean?
Wow.

759
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,620
I totally changed my whole thing,
but isn't that incredible that just a 

760
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,510
few events like that can.
Especially when you're a young man can 

761
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,860
just steer your life in one way or 
another can stick to you.

762
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,400
Are you down a road?
Like if you,

763
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,580
if you're,
if you'd never put that money in your 

764
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,621
mom's name and you continued paying your
bills and you dealt with all your 

765
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:17,621
tuition,
who knows?

766
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:19,190
You would have probably been a fucking 
war hero or something.

767
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,600
I'd be,
I'd be Brian,

768
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:21,370
Stan,
you know,

769
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,470
one of those characters.
I'd be super brainwashed.

770
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:25,460
I was maybe,
maybe not.

771
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,340
I mean,
you know,

772
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,910
as you get older,
you're,

773
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,020
you're smart.
You're not.

774
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,760
You want to start questioning shit.

775
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,560
My two best friends are seals,
right?

776
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,020
There's got out.
But like,

777
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:35,800
uh,
they,

778
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,030
they question,
you know what I mean?

779
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,590
Like they're not the same.
When they came in,

780
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,570
there were not.

781
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,090
It's kind of bullshit.
I have friends who not only served but 

782
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,010
went on and worked for Blackwater and 
they question everything they do.

783
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,130
They do for the money.
Well,

784
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,030
they do it because look,
my buddy who went to black powder,

785
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:53,470
he was getting like 30 grand a month 
started.

786
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:54,930
Jim bought a mustang

787
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,620
boy fucking.
He was guarding the oil ships for the 

788
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,890
pirates,
so it was four be four x.

789
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,500
He was on the ship and the pirates come 
and they blast them doing.

790
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,060
Yeah.
I see videos on the head.

791
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,920
Cam said,
well,

792
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,950
the crazy thing about the pirate 
situation and people don't even know why

793
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,890
those poor poor fucking people because 
another fucked up situation.

794
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,680
Somalia had never had a history of 
violence like that.

795
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,090
They weren't like people that would 
kidnap.

796
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:23,091
They were doing it because they were 
kidnapping these European captains of 

797
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,640
these boats that were dumping toxic 
waste off their shores.

798
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:29,641
So is that why your fishermen to 
Somalians were fishermen and so all 

799
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,380
these fish were dying and they're 
fucking starving and then people getting

800
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,140
birth defects.
All this pollution in the water,

801
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,390
the fish are polluted.
It's like really bad.

802
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:41,391
They dumped nuclear waste often,
so the Somalian start kidnap the 

803
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:46,411
captains to these boats and holding them
ransom for crimes against the 

804
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,350
environment.
So when they did that,

805
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,630
they were making millions of dollars so 
then they'd be like,

806
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,240
fuck fishing,
fishing.

807
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,140
But they're like,
look,

808
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,050
there's no fish left.
I mean the Fisher,

809
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:00,370
they don't untold tons of toxic waste 
off the shore of Somalia.

810
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,100
See,
I didn't know that.

811
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,520
That's supposed to know.
You don't even know all of these things.

812
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,290
We think we think these assholes are 
just.

813
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,660
They're just pirates.
They want to.

814
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,960
You know what I mean?
I don't know the story of my friends 

815
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:11,960
don't know the story.
I bet my name is Cielo friends.

816
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,700
I don't know if they had that in that 
Tom Hanks movie.

817
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:17,701
I didn't see that movie,
but that's an important part of why 

818
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:20,761
those fucking deal.
It's not like you just fell upon a 

819
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:22,110
village of [inaudible] and they all 
machine guns.

820
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,120
They're hopping into boats now.
These poor fishermen for thousands of 

821
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,020
years and we ruined their fish in like 
that for thousands of years.

822
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,450
These people live the exact same way.
Fishing,

823
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,820
living off the land,
having a good time,

824
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,180
you know,
getting by and all of a sudden some 

825
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,180
assets to dunk nuclear waste off duty.

826
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,190
I said,
I always say technology is the great 

827
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,190
evil dude.
Well,

828
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,240
some humans are evil.
Who's technology mean before technology?

829
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,590
You know,
Gingiss con was evil as fuck.

830
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,430
I mean there was,
there was people that would be,

831
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,450
I guess both our technology.
There's technology for back then people 

832
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:57,450
were,
you know,

833
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,430
do we have a great propensity for evil 
and for good,

834
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,460
but I mean now,
I mean like as far as like the world 

835
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,431
was.
I mean as it was all of history as far 

836
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:08,590
as in the last hundred years with 
technology,

837
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:09,980
we polluted.
Everything's fucked up.

838
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,960
That is true.
You know what I mean?

839
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,880
So I'm seeing that technology.
I know in my.

840
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,970
My thing is,
is that because I believe that the 

841
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,400
Michigan Lincoln Shit,
all that shit was really alien to know.

842
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,550
Do you really believe that?
I've written.

843
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,560
I read the best books.
I've read a ball to the twelfth plants 

844
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,560
series.

845
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Yeah,
yeah.

846
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,330
Zechariah stitching fucking good at it.
Makes more sense than anything else 

847
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:30,330
you've got to go to.
Situation is wrong.

848
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,380
Dot Com and then they prove them wrong 
thing.

849
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,040
Well,
the.

850
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,630
Here's the deal.
A lot of what he,

851
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:39,631
based on his,
his interpretation of some really 

852
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,201
bizarre old tax,
but what's really incredible about the 

853
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,680
Sumerians was how much they absolutely 
did know.

854
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,980
There was many,
many first came out of that area as far 

855
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,220
as we know.
First we'll first written language,

856
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:52,480
first agriculture,
first,

857
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:57,481
mathematics,
first written language that we're aware 

858
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:57,481
of it,
and they had a Godfrey's thing.

859
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,320
That's why I was thinking it made sense 
that,

860
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,060
Oh God,
for math,

861
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,770
because that was the elite and the 
thought of math.

862
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,180
You know what I mean?
The God for fucking I'll culture.

863
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,000
Well,
that guy showed me how to fucking make a

864
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,250
farm.
It could be.

865
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,010
It could be.
We had no way to prove either way,

866
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,690
but I figured like,
look at this,

867
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,950
look at the.
Look at the earth.

868
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,990
We're the only thing that doesn't belong
here.

869
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,380
We're the only thing on this earth that 
doesn't live on the earth,

870
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,150
were wearing clothes with live in the 
buildings.

871
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:23,680
Everything else is living on it for 
real.

872
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,850
We're all like,
we're like,

873
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:25,510
we don't belong here.
Like,

874
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,370
like we're out of place with the only 
thing that's out of place.

875
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,740
It's kind of like,
like we're half fucking alien,

876
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,750
half human.
We don't belong here.

877
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:33,640
You know what I mean?
Like us as dogs,

878
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,470
dogs are like us,
but they live.

879
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,560
They live off the earth.
Yeah.

880
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:37,930
But you know what I'm saying?
How they're very.

881
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,460
Like,
it could be like me and Shaquille o'neal

882
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,030
are the same species.
We could buy the same woman pregnant.

883
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,080
It doesn't make sense.
You know,

884
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:48,320
it's like a giraffe and a horse being 
able to get a cow pregnant,

885
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,640
you know?
It doesn't make any sense.

886
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,750
Like we don't look anything alike.
They'll bridge it to midget and Michael 

887
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,280
Jordan.
They're the same species.

888
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,110
How the fuck is that possible?
That's not the same.

889
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Just like dogs.
Dogs are the only animal that we're 

890
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,520
aware of that have that kind of 
arrogance that can interbreed like that.

891
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:08,521
It's,
it's a very strange thing because we 

892
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,151
know that dogs were human manipulated 
and then the whole argument with people 

893
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:12,260
that were the reason why there's a quote
unquote missing link,

894
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,320
which are I guess apparently when you 
talk to people really understand 

895
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,330
biology,
there really isn't a missing link.

896
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,930
It's just a matter of the fossil record 
been very difficult for all the pieces.

897
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,200
See the fossil record,
the issue with fossils is if you die or 

898
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,431
I die right here.
So like say if there's a gas leak in 

899
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:30,431
this building and explode,
we're not gonna leave.

900
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:33,500
A fossil man has stuck.
It has to be stuck in mud or something.

901
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,400
So it's real hard to make a fossil.
So there's probably.

902
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,030
And not only that,
humans are smart,

903
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,210
so the odds of them getting fossilized 
are probably less likely than a dumb 

904
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,631
ass.
Buffalo falls into a pit and all his 

905
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:46,631
buddies fall right in after them cause 
they're all fucking stupid.

906
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,930
Nobody figures out how to get the book 
makes such good sense because it's like 

907
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,090
how they said that they came here and we
were like,

908
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:57,140
the in between links,
like the monkey is Kinda guy like,

909
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:02,141
well these things were fucking smart,
but they're not smart enough to do what 

910
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:02,141
we would want them to do.

911
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:02,210
They're kind of,
they're still like animals,

912
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:03,650
you know,
always put some,

913
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,260
put some our genes and I'm smart and I'm
up.

914
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,210
Well,
you know,

915
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,850
possible.
Who knows?

916
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,360
It's sexy.
It is,

917
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,420
but you know what?
Because you know,

918
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:13,250
like the Old Testament or the,
all those stories,

919
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,320
if you read them in the terms of not God
but aliens.

920
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,770
That makes way more sense.
Well,

921
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,290
that's the switch and said he's a 
nephew,

922
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,580
limb.
He said he got in trouble when he was in

923
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:26,840
school because he said that their 
translations were incorrect.

924
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,060
He said that the Nephilim,
uh,

925
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,800
you know,
they would call them giants amongst men.

926
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,570
He was,
he was saying that isn't,

927
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:37,571
it isn't the eggs.
The actual translation shouldn't be 

928
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:38,550
those who came down,
meaning those came from above.

929
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,440
And then the Annunaki,
the literal translation.

930
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,540
Apparently as those from heaven to earth
came,

931
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,550
the idea that they came from some guys.

932
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,330
Yeah,
look,

933
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:52,331
if we put a fucking robot on Mars in 
2014 and we could watch realtime video 

934
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,530
that moving around,
that's a fact that things up there.

935
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,770
Humans are just one form of 
intelligence.

936
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,540
If the universe is filled with 
intelligence,

937
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,330
I guarantee you they're going to want to
check out what's on other planets.

938
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:04,370
Why wouldn't they?
Why wouldn't they send things?

939
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,990
We're trying to go places course and we 
would definitely visit if we could,

940
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,020
if we could visit Mars,
we haven't been able to figure out how 

941
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,241
to do it yet,
but they're trying to figure it out 

942
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,160
there.
We might be 20 years away from a person 

943
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,160
going to Mars,
so if that's the case,

944
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,970
why wouldn't someone come from another 
planet?

945
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,730
The real problem is nobody agrees with 
that.

946
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:23,720
Guys,
translations.

947
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,770
That's one one problem and the other 
problem is that all these people want to

948
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,270
believe in.
It's so bad.

949
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,420
It's so sexy that they don't look it at 
it as a.

950
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:37,410
maybe they gravitate towards it and they
run with it like this is the aliens came

951
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,040
and they work with our

952
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,840
DA.
Are you sure bitch you're not.

953
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,840
You're not sure,
but it makes more sense than the Bible.

954
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,580
It definitely makes more sense to the 
Bible,

955
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:46,650
but it's probably related.
If I could pick,

956
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,380
I'd rather of the Bible to be true.
I want to go to fucking heaven.

957
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,030
Just such thing.
You know what I mean?

958
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:56,031
I'd rather have that true.
I'd rather have Santa Claus all the 

959
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:56,031
fairytale fairytales.
True,

960
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,800
but I just think it makes more sense if 
there's an option Bible aliens.

961
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:00,930
I'm picking the aliens.
I don't think it's an either or option.

962
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:01,830
I mean,
first of all,

963
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,770
the real problem with the Bible is like 
that telephone game.

964
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,660
You know,
you tell your friends story,

965
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,550
he tells time,
it gets back to you.

966
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,780
It's fucked the stories.
Fuck.

967
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,170
And they told the stories of the Bible 
for over a thousand years before they 

968
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,170
ever wrote them down.

969
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,940
The oldest version of the Bible they 
have is in Aramaic and it's founded in 

970
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,240
these,
these clay pots in a place called Qumran

971
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,230
and it's called the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Yes.

972
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,440
That's the oldest version of the Nag.
Hammadi scrolls wherever.

973
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,640
The other ones.
Yeah.

974
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:33,641
There's,
there's quite a few ancient animal 

975
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:33,641
skins.
Actually.

976
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,520
Even the Samaritans had almost the same 
story.

977
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:37,980
It's just different names.
It's an old story.

978
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:38,910
From what?
From what?

979
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,810
Who's taught,
who taught us that?

980
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,670
Well,
it could be a bunch of different things,

981
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:42,120
man.
I mean,

982
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:46,680
you stop and think about the variance in
how far cultures of advanced today.

983
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,480
Like you could today.
You could go to the Amazon and find some

984
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:51,480
marine forest people that never seen 
people.

985
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,700
You show them your watch,
they'd be freaking out.

986
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,980
You show them a laptop,
they think you're a fucking wizard.

987
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,990
I mean,
just think about that today.

988
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,000
But that happened in World War Two,
right?

989
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,840
Yes,
it did.

990
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,030
Island,
they're from,

991
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,030
um,
chariots of the gods,

992
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:09,270
a Erich von Daniken documentary.
Like we gave them candies and shit.

993
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:12,540
And like they thought we were a.
and they built fake airplanes.

994
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:17,541
The worship,
they want us to come back and whenever 

995
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:17,541
he came back and we want to.
God,

996
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:18,900
that's exactly.
Exactly.

997
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,490
Yeah,
that's exactly what it's like.

998
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,760
I think that if you're a 
superintelligent race or a super 

999
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,191
intelligent civilization rather,
and you run into someone of your own 

1000
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:32,481
race that just happens to be trapped in 
the outback of Australia and living off 

1001
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:36,981
the land,
they would have no idea that within a 

1002
00:37:36,981 --> 00:37:36,981
thousand years they had been living like
this.

1003
00:37:36,981 --> 00:37:40,380
Which cultures exist in the same static 
state for a thousand years all the time,

1004
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,270
but look what's happened in this 
country.

1005
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:44,880
Just 200 fucking years crazy.
There's no America.

1006
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:46,530
Three hundred years ago it didn't exist.

1007
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,570
There was nothing here.
There was no buildings.

1008
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,960
There's no roads and in 300 years you 
got la,

1009
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,880
Chicago,
New Orleans,

1010
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:57,090
and fucking fucking chaos all over the 
place.

1011
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:02,091
That's a blip in time.
So for these people living in a static 

1012
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:03,570
state for a thousand years,
all of a sudden people come in.

1013
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,160
Then they tell stories about these 
people.

1014
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:07,380
Those people are fucking alien span.
They came,

1015
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:12,381
they had chariots.
Horses drove them around like when the 

1016
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:13,280
ink is first saw,
the uh,

1017
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,060
um,
the Spaniards,

1018
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,880
they thought they were fucking God's 
people on horses.

1019
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,260
They thought they were a part of the 
horse.

1020
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,060
They didn't even know what the fuck was 
going on.

1021
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,220
They thought it was quite so quantile 
returning.

1022
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,470
They had no idea was happening.
They were freaking out.

1023
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,460
So I think that those stories,
when you,

1024
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:33,461
you,
you're dealing with over a thousand 

1025
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:33,461
years of them telling them back and 
forth before anybody writes them down.

1026
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:35,800
Then they write them down.
They write them down an era man,

1027
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,080
they

1028
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,010
write them down in ancient Hebrew and 
meech and Hebrew.

1029
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,160
They,
they only know like three out of four 

1030
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,051
words today in ancient Hebrew and 
letters were numbers like the word God 

1031
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:50,791
and the word love.
They had the same numeric value like 

1032
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,821
words like war machine would have a 
specific numeric value that would not 

1033
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:58,321
just represent your name but also like 
what you are and like a person who your 

1034
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:03,271
lover or your mother would represent.
We have a certain number to it and that 

1035
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:06,100
was important in the waist sentence,
was translating information.

1036
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,790
They lost all that shit when they 
translated it to to Greek,

1037
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:14,791
into Latin,
and they did all that's missing and say 

1038
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,600
you get this flat interpretation of this
really bizarre,

1039
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:21,601
ancient language.
That was a language that it was also 

1040
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:22,570
numbers.
It was a math and a language together.

1041
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,630
It's hard for us to even wrap our heads 
around,

1042
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:26,470
which is crazy that people fucking 
really,

1043
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:31,471
really believing kill for it like they 
want to believe because if you don't 

1044
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,340
believe,
then you have this open ended questions.

1045
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,140
Everybody likes to be fucking 
comfortable.

1046
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,410
I'm pretty wants to retire.
Everybody wants to run the win.

1047
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:42,411
The lottery.
What they don't understand is the 

1048
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:42,411
beauty's in the struggle.
The beauty is in the struggle.

1049
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,220
Really appreciate life.
You've got to know you're going to die.

1050
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,250
You've got to know it could be all over.
That's how you really appreciate it.

1051
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,460
That's true.
It's just like fighting,

1052
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:50,990
you know,
like,

1053
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,650
uh,
when I was brand new you,

1054
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:57,120
you envision or when I feel like I'm in 
Tj fighting in Tijuana,

1055
00:39:57,121 --> 00:40:02,121
right?
And like when I be in the UFC was gonna 

1056
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:02,121
be this way.
I get to doc and it ain't that way.

1057
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,750
It's Tj.
It's the same thing.

1058
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,190
It's the same fight,
but just struggle.

1059
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,980
It's just dominick Cruz,
you guys live with them,

1060
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:09,680
you know,
he's been wanting buddies all like,

1061
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,910
now you're the champion.
He's a champion.

1062
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,360
It's not real for him.
Like people that don't know him seeing 

1063
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,120
me as the champion,
but for him he's still him and like he's

1064
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:20,460
fighting for the belt.
He has the boat but it's not real.

1065
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,570
It's like the first time I ever saw like
my meat myself fight in the UFC.

1066
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,780
I foughtj rock and I got home and I 
googled it or whatever and I found it 

1067
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,750
and it was like,
it didn't seem right.

1068
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:35,751
Like I was in the,
in there like with Joe Rogan's 

1069
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:35,751
interviewed me after the fight,
you know,

1070
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:39,510
it doesn't seem.
It seems like I like photoshop that in 

1071
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,510
today.

1072
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,510
Yeah,
because you're still,

1073
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,670
you your.
But now you're seeing you as other 

1074
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,670
people see you.
Yeah.

1075
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,840
So would you envision something in a way
it's going to be in an ever that way?

1076
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Well,
isn't that also one of the things that 

1077
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:51,960
happens when people start attacking you 
online?

1078
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,860
It's like people,
they're attacking like a celebrity.

1079
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,520
They're attacking adjusted Bieber,
they're attacking whoever the fuck it is

1080
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,800
that they see that as the object of 
their attention,

1081
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,370
but that person who they're attacking,
you don't even know them.

1082
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,440
Like you don't know any of these people 
and yet they,

1083
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:06,060
they,
they feel,

1084
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,170
they feel that you're like a free 
target.

1085
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,900
They want to kill me,
dude.

1086
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,820
People,
hey,

1087
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,800
people say fucked up.
Like just like last week,

1088
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,050
someone's like,
like,

1089
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,780
yeah,
you suck.

1090
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:19,781
And Cpr,
like motherfuckers be referring to my 

1091
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:20,150
dad.
I get that all the time.

1092
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:20,930
People say,
I'm like,

1093
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,830
dude,
you don't like,

1094
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,690
I don't,
I don't get obsessed too long.

1095
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,130
Like I almost had to laugh.
Like,

1096
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,720
what a fucking Dick.
Like what?

1097
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,910
You don't even know.
Why would you say that?

1098
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:29,960
Like that's addicting.
You don't know.

1099
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:35,190
It's the Internet man.
The problem is that people could say 

1100
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,190
shit the Internet and there's

1101
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,980
no social accountability.
Now Accountability and you don't feel 

1102
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,581
it.
Like if you say something mean to 

1103
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:42,581
somebody,
how many.

1104
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:42,581
I can tell you,
me personally,

1105
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:44,030
I've said Shit where I might've been 
just joking around,

1106
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:49,031
but I said something mean and then I saw
the look on a person's face and I'm 

1107
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:49,031
like,
I'm sorry.

1108
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:52,871
I was just fucking around.
I didn't even mean you don't mean it to 

1109
00:41:52,871 --> 00:41:55,631
come off that way sometimes,
but you do so when you just get a free 

1110
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:56,380
ride and he just,
he's fucking war machine,

1111
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,530
second CPR and they send that out there.
It's like,

1112
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,990
it's bad for people.
It's unhealthy.

1113
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,880
Sucks.
And creates sociopath's.

1114
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,060
Yeah.
You know what it's like whenever I go 

1115
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,521
out,
I've never had one person to be mean to 

1116
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:12,521
me.
Of course not.

1117
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:12,521
They're always nice to me and,
and I'm,

1118
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:12,521
I'm,
I'm,

1119
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:13,130
I'm,
I'm cool man.

1120
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,190
As long as you have to do something dumb
for me to be mad at,

1121
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,980
you know what I mean?
I'm cool.

1122
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,280
But like,
where are you guys when I'm out,

1123
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,120
you guys want to recall it being said to
me when I'm out.

1124
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,220
You want to do it on here?
Why do you do that?

1125
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:23,390
You know,
I'm glad because I don't know.

1126
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,700
It's probably different people,
but if you met them,

1127
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,140
it probably be the same thing,
man.

1128
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:28,910
I mean people are asking me about that 
all the time.

1129
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,640
Like do you ever get hassled people?
Wanna fight you already?

1130
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,890
Never.
People were nice to me everywhere,

1131
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,000
everywhere,
everywhere wanting to me,

1132
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,970
man,
I'm going to give you a hug.

1133
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,880
I'm friend that you know,
and once they realize that,

1134
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,910
but it's,
you know,

1135
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:43,970
you're just become an object when you're
on a computer screen or on television 

1136
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:43,970
when you're fighting,
you know,

1137
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,901
like your focus is guards bullshitted 
sort come up with some reason that fight

1138
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:50,270
that you had with Jay rock.

1139
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:55,270
Dude,
that was a important fight for me for 

1140
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,311
two reasons.
One because I realized how much damage 

1141
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:57,311
you can do from the guard with your 
elbows.

1142
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,880
Me Up,
dude.

1143
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,910
That was a,
that was a big moment for me because I 

1144
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,850
never saw anybody deliver elbows like he
did from the golf.

1145
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,850
I don't even know how he practiced that.
I mean I asked them pass tech.

1146
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,690
He told me,
he told me that he was like a tire,

1147
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,310
like a tire in between his legs.
Like even the Guardian smashing it,

1148
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,550
but I mean like,
dude I have this day.

1149
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,610
No one's done it like that.
I like that he was good.

1150
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,690
Um,
I was dizzy for a concussion for like a 

1151
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:23,690
week and half that I thought I was 
dizzy.

1152
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:23,690
I believe you,
man.

1153
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,970
I mean that that night I had this chick.
Oh she was so hot.

1154
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:30,971
Dudes try and I was going go smash words
at the palms that night and I took her 

1155
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,620
home board.
I was doing.

1156
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,420
I was so dizzy trying to fuck her going 
to throw up.

1157
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,180
I laid down and I was asked if he did 
come and throw up at the same time I 

1158
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:42,290
laid down bro.
I was,

1159
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,190
hey,
you just got to ride me.

1160
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,370
But I couldn't lay flat.
The room was spinning.

1161
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,610
Did you call her bro?

1162
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,800
Fucking hammered.
You were.

1163
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,870
But I had to sit up.
I had to stood up like upright and have 

1164
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:55,910
a riding because I laid down the room 
was spinning.

1165
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,920
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1166
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,810
But he jacked me up with those elbows.
Dude.

1167
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:01,430
That was one of the most effective uses 
of elbows from the guard.

1168
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I've ever seen the only other time I've 
seen something really crazy from the 

1169
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,561
guard looked at as you're Brian Hall.
Stop that dude from his guard on the 

1170
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:11,861
last issue,
the last version of tough and you have 

1171
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:12,380
to guard.
He was on top.

1172
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:13,390
He got reversed.
He had to do,

1173
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,830
I think,
I forget how he got into his car,

1174
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:16,910
but anyway,
in his guard,

1175
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,980
knocks the guy out with punches from the
car.

1176
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:21,320
That doesn't seem that crazy.
I've never seen that before.

1177
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:26,240
But that mother fucker hits hard.
But that Jay rock fight was also intense

1178
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:28,430
because you guys were really good 
friends.

1179
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,640
You guys have become real close in the 
house and you were hitting him and then 

1180
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:33,640
you were saying,
I'm sorry.

1181
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,620
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1182
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,060
I love it.
Yeah,

1183
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,380
we were talking.
Yeah,

1184
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,240
we talk and during the fight and you 
were doing it like a couple feet from me

1185
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,010
and I remember thinking like,
Whoa,

1186
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,740
this is some heavy shit and I'm trying 
to do the commentary.

1187
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,890
I would like to have just been able to 
just say nothing and just watch it 

1188
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,680
because it was a great fight.
But it was also like,

1189
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,050
there was a crazy interpersonal 
situation.

1190
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,740
It was weird,
man,

1191
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,880
after the fight when you're going to do 
me A.

1192
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,950
I cried because I was happy.
I cry because I was sad because I ruined

1193
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:00,060
his.
His dreams.

1194
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,900
Yeah.
It was genuine.

1195
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,650
It was very genuine.
I was like fuck,

1196
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,380
like was I want to win it because at the
end of the day is my,

1197
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,540
my life has to succeed,
but I don't want to kick with my 

1198
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:10,540
friend's dreams.

1199
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:10,540
Like,
you know what I mean?

1200
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,310
And that's the hard thing about mma is 
that if we were making,

1201
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,780
if we're all making maybe with her money
dude,

1202
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,920
like oh just go joe,
20 million.

1203
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:22,921
She gives a fuck.
But like when you know that the person 

1204
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:22,921
that they lose,
they might not,

1205
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,300
they might not have a job anymore.
It's different doing,

1206
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,400
you know,
especially if you like the Guy George 

1207
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:30,400
said it best,
he said he would never fight a friend.

1208
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,240
He said because there's things that he 
does to Apollo.

1209
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,750
He would never do to a friend.
He said I just couldn't.

1210
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,970
I couldn't not do it if I was on top of 
him,

1211
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,260
I could not deliver elbows to his head.
Concussive damage.

1212
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Yeah.
He was just talking about like the 

1213
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:45,860
viciousness of dropping elbows on 
someone's head.

1214
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,260
You just wouldn't do that to your 
friend.

1215
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:47,610
You wouldn't be able to do that to your 
friend.

1216
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,080
Yeah.
But more than that,

1217
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:54,081
because I mean,
I spoil my buddies and we'd beat the 

1218
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:54,081
shit out of each other.
You know,

1219
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:54,081
there's a little different,
right?

1220
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,270
It's different,
but trying to kill him.

1221
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,880
It's,
there's,

1222
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,660
there's the fee thing in competition 
where it's fucking real.

1223
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,100
This is real.
This is,

1224
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,860
this is not just competing in the gym.
This is,

1225
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,390
this is ready.
Ready,

1226
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,080
go.
Ding.

1227
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:08,550
The bell rings.
The cameras are on you.

1228
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,780
There's no take backs.
There's no redos.

1229
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,480
The hard part would be,
uh,

1230
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,850
would be finishing in front enough ones 
that hurt.

1231
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,000
Like say if you're going to knock him 
out and then that has happened.

1232
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,650
Right?
But if you rock him and he's like,

1233
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,650
you know,
trying to put them out that,

1234
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,740
that'd be like fuck,
you know.

1235
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,830
And he's like,
you'd want the rep to stop it.

1236
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:26,490
It'd be different,
you know,

1237
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:28,680
like Mochida Munoz,
perfect example,

1238
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,710
real good friends,
Machita head kicks him and moved into 

1239
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:33,710
close the show and decided not to.

1240
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,420
Whereas anybody else,
he would have hit him with seven punches

1241
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,350
before that referee kill mode.
You know,

1242
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,960
he gets into those fucking karate 
punches.

1243
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,380
He throws those rapid fire,
right hands.

1244
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,240
Yeah.
Machida's a closer.

1245
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,300
And you know,
that was a perfect example of the 

1246
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,300
difference between fighting a friend.
And he was crazy.

1247
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,010
That was crazy.
Head kicked too because he knocked them 

1248
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:55,010
out through his.
He had his guard up.

1249
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,370
He went through his hand.
Sometimes that's not enough.

1250
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,120
Not enough for a head.
There's some power in the dude like that

1251
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,750
is so fucking hard.
That's why the Thai guys,

1252
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,860
they both hands and away from their 
head.

1253
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,830
Yeah.
This,

1254
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:08,700
it'll still at the Andrew transfers 
through,

1255
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:13,870
through your army.
Is it hard to make that transition 

1256
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:13,870
though to the smaller gloves?
Because you know,

1257
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,681
the problem with the smaller gloves too 
is when dudes try to do like that k one 

1258
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:19,290
styled Dutch thing like this.

1259
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,980
There's all these openings that don't 
exist with those exact.

1260
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,210
This is exactly why since two years ago 
I refused the spoiler.

1261
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,530
Big Loss and I don't do it ever again.
I don't want to do it.

1262
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:32,800
Smart could just be and people say and 
dangerous,

1263
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,670
man,
I'll tell you what,

1264
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,960
watching UFC,
knowing from punches,

1265
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,310
it's mostly elbows,
headbutts,

1266
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,170
accident needs,
whatever I'm that happens,

1267
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:46,171
but it's rare and they're going all out.
Punches usually don't get cut that much 

1268
00:47:46,171 --> 00:47:48,160
and in practice I've never cut normal 
little gloves.

1269
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:53,190
When you grease your face up to the 
fight and fight a lot of grease and they

1270
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:58,180
sell the puffy sparring gloves and I 
tell you what mean.

1271
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,550
We go hard with those and I've never 
been cut,

1272
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,670
not cut anybody,
but then when I was sparring j Romley 

1273
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,150
foster and pure long time ago,
headgear ambig gloves.

1274
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,440
I cut the shit out of him.

1275
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,410
I just a wild party.
This is what's happening.

1276
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,830
If it's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen,

1277
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:16,831
but like you said,
the big loves you can get used to 

1278
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:16,831
blocking way differently.
It's a big old thing,

1279
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,000
but you can't block that way,
so I don't.

1280
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,550
I only probably a little gloves now.
Yeah,

1281
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,410
you see that a lot from like the real 
high level kickboxer guys.

1282
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:26,890
They'd go into mma when they realized 
how many openings are left,

1283
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:32,010
where they're so used to like if you 
find like a nicky hold sand in one of 

1284
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,730
those type guys that like fights,
that classic Amsterdam style,

1285
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,360
they,
they,

1286
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:36,250
they,
they have that hands up high,

1287
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:41,251
which is fantastic for kickboxing.
But when guys like that enter to mma 

1288
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,280
like alister,
like it's.

1289
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,520
It's a weird thing because there's all 
these openings there now and say,

1290
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:46,570
I think that you want good,
good.

1291
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,250
Boxers are,
they can,

1292
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,360
they can,
they can block always punches.

1293
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,770
That was a little bit ain't gonna 
Happen.

1294
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,700
It's not going it.
And what happens is if your defense,

1295
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,200
if you're not comfortable in your 
defense,

1296
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,830
then it ruined everything because you 
start panicking like why am I,

1297
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,910
how's it?
How's it hitting me?

1298
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:03,490
You know what I mean?
Such a difference in the impact as well.

1299
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:08,491
If even if you do catch a punch,
like say if you catch a guys right hand 

1300
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:09,880
and you know you have it in front of 
your face with that little glove,

1301
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,930
there's not much protecting.
You enhance that big ass glove.

1302
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:18,931
The boxing glove,
it's like a big pillow hitting you in 

1303
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:18,931
the face.
I mean obviously you know,

1304
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:23,251
it's still fucking hurts and dudes get.
But there's such a difference in those 

1305
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,270
four rounds to eight ounce gloves to an 
enormous difference and most of them are

1306
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:26,380
fighting with 10 ounce gloves.

1307
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,330
Yeah.
You know,

1308
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
the last two years,
man,

1309
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:34,441
I don't it,
like right now I could towards him like 

1310
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:35,500
tours and they do Tuesday is little 
gloves and there's this big lifts.

1311
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:37,420
I don't go to Thursday really.
And they say,

1312
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,360
well it's good to do both.
I don't think is good is my opinion,

1313
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:44,980
but I'm stubborn and you know,
that's the way I don't believe in it.

1314
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,040
You know,
it's definitely different and it's 

1315
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,040
interesting to see even though the court
what,

1316
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,961
what year you were,
what year was your year of the ultimate 

1317
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:53,961
fighter?
Two thousand seven.

1318
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:55,330
Two thousand seven.
Even from 2007 to today,

1319
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:56,710
thinking about how much things have 
changed,

1320
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,920
there was no we'll kicks back then no 
front kicks to the face and what it was 

1321
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:01,920
doing.
The karate kids were coming in.

1322
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,990
They were starting to now,
so like ufc one people thought quite.

1323
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,260
It was disapproved because they got only
one thing.

1324
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,570
Then everyone went to like wrestling Jiu
Jitsu and now cried.

1325
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,590
He keeps coming back because I figured 
if you can box and wrestling Jiu Jitsu 

1326
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,440
and a cool credit kick acute,
it could work.

1327
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,100
You got to mix a little bit of 
everything because like even Bruni,

1328
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:26,390
you don't fucking meathead Bruni.
Well last year,

1329
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,790
so I'm gonna start doing like shut up 
bitch.

1330
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:29,810
I swear dude.
No,

1331
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,530
I'm serious dude.
Peter was doing it and he's like,

1332
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,750
man,
I think it's good to know.

1333
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,280
I just want to like three of those good 
kicks.

1334
00:50:35,281 --> 00:50:35,900
And I said,
well,

1335
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,280
I said,
well it won't hurt,

1336
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:42,281
but you know what I mean.
I know I can't really picture Brian 

1337
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:42,281
doing that.
I can picture him doing it.

1338
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:42,440
Could you?
You got a bad ass kicked.

1339
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:44,960
I was watching some videos of you 
kicking the bag with St Pierre.

1340
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,650
Yeah,
Dude.

1341
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,010
I was a kid.
That's all I did was taekwondo,

1342
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,550
taekwondo fan type one was all kicks,
kicks,

1343
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,810
but the problem was I transitioned into 
kickboxing when I was 21 and my fucking 

1344
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,070
hands were terrible.
I was getting lit up in the gym,

1345
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,220
but I just couldn't believe it.
I thought my hands were way better and 

1346
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,220
then I,
I,

1347
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,600
I cut out like maybe 60 percent of all 
taekwondo techniques and I concentrated 

1348
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:14,510
on like a core fundamental techniques 
and started learning how to box and then

1349
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:16,070
I started doing more Tine.
I realized,

1350
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,570
oh,
then there's leg kicks.

1351
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,740
God Damn it.
It was a.

1352
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,490
those are lots of things.
Like everyone was so stubborn.

1353
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:24,410
You can't.
There's good things and everything.

1354
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:28,670
The thing about learning the taekwondo 
is you because there's no punches to the

1355
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:32,450
face and there's no leg kicks.
You get really good at doing shit that's

1356
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:33,290
super risky.

1357
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,960
If guys are throwing leg kicks and 
punches you in the face,

1358
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:41,170
whereas you might not really get good at
those techniques because you wouldn't 

1359
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:41,170
put as much care to throw.
Um,

1360
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:41,170
yeah,
exactly.

1361
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:41,960
So you get real good at.
Um,

1362
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:43,250
and then when you learn those other 
things,

1363
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,800
you already have that crazy dexterity.
You know,

1364
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:50,240
my boy has bad ass kicks at Radcliffe,
the black kid and I'm living here.

1365
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:50,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

1366
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,250
He has nasty,
nasty kicks.

1367
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,740
His actually,
his mom taught him about it.

1368
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,750
Karate Pedis,
the both of the brothers,

1369
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,060
brothers,
they have nasty taekwondo.

1370
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:04,061
They started out and taekwondo and then 
they learned from Duke Roufus all the 

1371
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,060
other fundamentals of kickboxing and 
mma.

1372
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:10,210
I think that's a good combination.
It's a good way to do it because 

1373
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,210
otherwise it's hard to learn those 
kicks.

1374
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,400
It's hard unless you're feet to her.
How the fuck that kind of like 

1375
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:15,400
downloaded a black belt to his brain.

1376
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:15,740
That's what Joe Silva said.
Yeah.

1377
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:20,741
Well that's like he's a freak of nature.
But I was like St Pierre,

1378
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:27,070
his first fight,
if you watch it in like second Canada 

1379
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,070
ring,
he can't wrestle were shit.

1380
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,050
Nothing,
now he's like,

1381
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,070
no one can do that,
but wasn't a fascinating.

1382
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,350
Now when you saw him lock up with Johnny
Hendricks,

1383
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,660
he couldn't take Hendrix down.
Yeah,

1384
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,570
I mean that's,
that's the difference between,

1385
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,680
you know,
you catch a guy,

1386
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:42,710
especially not in the transition,
not in between punches,

1387
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:44,960
but actually just just trying to take 
him down.

1388
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,200
Good luck.
Henry's hopping around on one leg,

1389
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:49,490
punched him in the face,
nothing.

1390
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,540
And George couldn't take them down.
Which is crazy when you think about how 

1391
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:54,540
good George's wrestling is in a lot of 
his other fights.

1392
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,860
Not that was a johnny did a.
he's a burden.

1393
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:58,400
I thought,
dude,

1394
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,660
it was funny when the fight.

1395
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,620
No,
he wanted to fight.

1396
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,820
No,
he won the fight.

1397
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,690
He got robbed.
But I think almost everybody that I've 

1398
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:07,690
talked to that watch that fight,
he said,

1399
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,770
I want to say a period of when they 
don't really know what.

1400
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,890
I didn't want him to fight Johnny 
Hendricks,

1401
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,710
in my opinion,
college tech beat Hendrix.

1402
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,420
That was a bad decision.
I don't think.

1403
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,510
I think Katrin won that fight.
I was ready for Hendrix because I didn't

1404
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,370
like how strict.
I thought it was a very close fight.

1405
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:25,580
That's for sure.
I thought that if I was seeing pure man,

1406
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:26,250
I would say fuck

1407
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,590
that.
I would fight Anderson and retire.

1408
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,860
I think it could be the Anderson who's 
actually can't wrestle.

1409
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,210
He's had headaches for the last couple 
of years,

1410
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,440
George.
Oh really?

1411
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah.
Freddie Roach was just talking about it.

1412
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:42,190
George has had some migraines.
He's been talking to them about it over 

1413
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:42,580
the last two years has been suffering 
from Migraines,

1414
00:53:42,581 --> 00:53:44,110
so that was the personal problems we was
talking about.

1415
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:49,230
Well that was one of them.
I think there was some other stuff that 

1416
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,650
he doesn't want to talk about,
but the physical problems are legit.

1417
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,940
When he was on the podcast,
man,

1418
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:55,040
he was talking to me about aliens and he
was talking about like I was.

1419
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,110
I was pushing him.
I was like,

1420
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,310
you believe in aliens,
you believe?

1421
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:01,990
Like apparently when they filmed the 
countdown show with him primetime show,

1422
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:07,790
there was a whole segment that they 
filmed while he was talking about like 

1423
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:08,320
worrying,
like has nightmares about being abducted

1424
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:11,350
by aliens and then he has it in his mind
what he would do if,

1425
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,330
if aliens came.
And Anthony Junior,

1426
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,440
Donald told me about this,
I go,

1427
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:19,441
why didn't they put that in the show?
Like the UFC didn't want to have that 

1428
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:19,441
in.
And I was like that's crazy.

1429
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:23,611
So I asked him about it on the podcast 
and one of the things he was talking 

1430
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:26,020
about though was about missing time.
Sometime I'm in my car and then all of a

1431
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:28,180
sudden I'm at the gym and I don't know 
how it got there.

1432
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,500
And like,
okay dude,

1433
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,960
like that is not aliens

1434
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:37,090
that's called we had too much and it's a
fact because I'm not that.

1435
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,080
I don't think I punched drunk,
but I lose my car all the time.

1436
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:42,420
Now.
Eric Jensen,

1437
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,600
j rock fight.
Actually I lose my car,

1438
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,330
look like if I go through them all,
my car's gone.

1439
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,130
I literally do.
I have to fucking get a flag.

1440
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:52,720
And put it on his roof.
I got to put A.

1441
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,450
I put a little note in my phone like 
level four,

1442
00:54:55,451 --> 00:55:00,451
like I had to put a note.
I'll lose my car if I park like memento 

1443
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:00,940
for parking.
I do,

1444
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,820
but like a Broan is worse than me 
though.

1445
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:08,821
Even if you forgets things I can.
You asked me that same question like 

1446
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:08,950
five times in a day.
No,

1447
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,270
but this is just,
I mean everyone who fights noses,

1448
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:18,271
dangerous sport.
That's why I get pissed off when the 

1449
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,720
football players are suing the NFL 
motherfucker.

1450
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:22,240
You guys made millions.
It's a violent sport.

1451
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:27,241
You knew you're going to get a head 
injury like you got paid what you could 

1452
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:27,241
do.
You know what I mean?

1453
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:27,290
And we,
we,

1454
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,320
we don't get paid.
I don't think what we do and we're 

1455
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:32,320
getting the same injuries when nothing's
gonna happen to us.

1456
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,210
We're going back to the wrestler.
The rest of the movie is gonna Happen to

1457
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:36,130
80 percent of fighters.
You know what I mean?

1458
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:39,520
I'm hoping that they're going to figure 
out some sort of a medical solution.

1459
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,060
I feel like if you look at the 
advancements in science and medicine and

1460
00:55:43,061 --> 00:55:48,061
what they've been able to figure out 
about how to fix all sorts of injuries 

1461
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:49,030
that fixing traumatic brain injuries 
probably next,

1462
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,230
and I know that the,
uh,

1463
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:55,650
this uh,
thing called the intrepid center for 

1464
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,090
excellence and they work with soldiers 
coming back from the war that have brain

1465
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:03,091
injuries to big issue and they've made 
some big improvements and helping 

1466
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:03,091
people.
Um,

1467
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:04,010
but I,
I'm,

1468
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:04,950
I'm with you.
Um,

1469
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:09,850
I would way rather see a fighter retired
too soon and too late and it bums me out

1470
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:13,180
when I see a guy that's been in too long
and I see them struggling

1471
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,220
and you know,
the worst part is,

1472
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,360
is if you,
they're doing it just because they need 

1473
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,360
money.
Yeah.

1474
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,360
You know what I mean?
Like,

1475
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,360
like,
you know,

1476
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,950
some guys like they didn't even retire,
but these don't,

1477
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,980
they needed for their money when they 
take

1478
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,880
fights,
they shouldn't take short notice.

1479
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:31,170
Whatever,
when they're not prepared against a 

1480
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,170
dangerous guy too.
And they get more damaged,

1481
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,170
you know?
Exactly.

1482
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,170
Well,
that's a real,

1483
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,310
that's a real issue.
You know,

1484
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,880
nobody wants to fight this guy,
well,

1485
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:38,881
why do you think nobody wants to fight 
this guy because they're not the same 

1486
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:41,311
level as him and because if they do 
finally going to get knocked the fuck 

1487
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:44,071
out,
and then they say they're scared that 

1488
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,521
they're gonna get fired and that's not 
like you can't say that a guy scared 

1489
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:49,200
because nobody,
everyone entering into the UFC is not a 

1490
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,320
perfect finished product.
They're just not.

1491
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,400
It's,
it's a development cycle that goes 

1492
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,751
through the entirety of your career and 
one of the things about boxing is they 

1493
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:01,591
know where their fighter is at and they 
try to match them up well before they 

1494
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:01,660
give them a title shot.

1495
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,600
If you look at boxing,
you'll see a lot of guys challenging for

1496
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:09,601
the title that only have like maybe one 
last two losses in their entire career 

1497
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:12,520
and a lot of them happen early because 
they get a manager and they slowly build

1498
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:15,010
them up and then they start testing them
and they do test them,

1499
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,280
but they test them once they develop 
some serious worldclass skills.

1500
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,830
Boxing,
you fight nothing but chumps pretty much

1501
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,890
like you.
You,

1502
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,380
you,
you get a lot of work,

1503
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,130
easy,
easy,

1504
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:25,810
easy guys.
Step up a little bit.

1505
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:27,490
So he did.
If he didn't do good,

1506
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:28,770
pull them back the next time.
Make it easier,

1507
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,670
you know what I mean?
They have so many fights.

1508
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:32,260
I thought that's how the guys get like 
30,

1509
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:33,220
you know,
you know what I mean?

1510
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,580
Because they didn't fight it.
No 1:30,

1511
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:36,790
you know,
they realize also that that's the way to

1512
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:41,791
make the money,
the way to make the money to build up a 

1513
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,430
manny Pacquiao to build up a ricky 
Hatton to build up a floyd mayweather.

1514
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,410
You gotta have a lot of fights like 
floyd made.

1515
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:49,411
They're made,
whether it's the only one has been able 

1516
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:49,411
to go through the fire over and over and
over again and come on undefeated.

1517
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,940
See and there's a special athlete and 
then the thing like,

1518
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,730
I don't want to knock on the UFC because
that's your boss.

1519
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,750
Whatever.
What you work for them,

1520
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:57,850
but like you,
she doesn't want to.

1521
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,230
Margaret Carter was one of the market,
the UFC.

1522
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,580
Well,
it's smart.

1523
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,800
If you were a business,
we're a business.

1524
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:05,230
It's smart to market fighters as well.
Look,

1525
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,510
Ronda Rousey,
I know how much Ronda Rousey's making.

1526
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,840
She's making incredible money.
If you're a paper view draw,

1527
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,140
if you're a George St Pierre,
if you're someone that's making a ton of

1528
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:19,141
money,
you make you make money based on how 

1529
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:19,141
many paper views you sell,
so they're.

1530
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:23,380
They're making shitloads of money,
so there's what people read online as 

1531
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,430
far as like how much the UFC pays.

1532
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,310
It's like these are the disclosed 
revenue.

1533
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:29,830
They disclosed incomes,
but that's not what they get paid.

1534
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,510
There's a bunch of other shit involved 
as well.

1535
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:35,020
There's there's bonuses and then on top 
of the bonuses there's what they get for

1536
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:40,021
each paper view sale,
so they don't disclose and a lot of is 

1537
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:40,480
because a lot of fighters don't want 
people to disclose,

1538
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:45,870
but if you're a guy who's start now and 
you want to eventually work your way up 

1539
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,540
to to get to championship status,
like it's a fucking minefield.

1540
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,940
Like look at Brock Lesnar is a perfect 
example.

1541
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:53,500
I was talking to Dana about this last 
night.

1542
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,740
Is there ever been a guy,
whereas fucking second fight and he's 

1543
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,670
fighting the former UFC heavyweight 
champion is who mirror was in his prime.

1544
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,260
I mean mayor was,
you know,

1545
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,750
as good as he's ever been.
When brock fought him,

1546
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,030
know that his problem was that he was 
famous.

1547
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,030
He had to be thrown in there and you 
know what Kim was last,

1548
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,600
I think at the same kind of problem.
Kimbo slice it when he sucks.

1549
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,270
He's only been training a couple of 
years,

1550
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:20,920
dude,
but he doesn't suck.

1551
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,970
You just inexperienced.
He has potential,

1552
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:27,971
but he was too famous,
too fast and he had a fight to go to 

1553
00:59:27,971 --> 00:59:28,230
guys too fast and got washed out.
You know what I mean?

1554
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,140
It was like his own a marketing,
you know,

1555
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,460
guerrilla marketing on the Internet 
stuff worked for him and against them,

1556
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,290
you know?
Did you ever see the Sean Gannon fight,

1557
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,250
the old old,
old,

1558
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:37,690
old,
old,

1559
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:41,210
old way back in the day before.
That is one of the great.

1560
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,550
Pull that shit up,
Shawn Garrett versus Kimbo slice.

1561
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,760
That is one of the greatest displays of 
heart ever.

1562
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:51,761
For folks who don't know,
Kimbo slice became famous on the 

1563
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,300
Internet for all these crazy knockouts 
in his backyard fights.

1564
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,220
He'd fight dudes,
bare knuckle boxing,

1565
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:56,780
backyard fights,
beat the shit out of them,

1566
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,960
make all this money,
and he was just cool looking cat with 

1567
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,080
big,
big giant tub knuckles and really nice 

1568
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,080
guy.
Super Nice,

1569
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,250
Super Nice Guy.
He look at his image,

1570
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,220
you think one thing and you meet him.
He's so friendly,

1571
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,250
ready to throw down.
He's just ready to throw it down.

1572
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,390
So he became famous and there's a cop 
from Boston named Sharon Gannon.

1573
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:19,660
This motherfucker has a head,
like a fire hydrant and this is when 

1574
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,320
they were in the middle of it.
This is like the.

1575
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,920
Everybody broke it up.
They got on.

1576
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,290
There was a lot of money.
No wrestling.

1577
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,360
Yeah.
He said it had to be a stand up fight.

1578
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:31,361
Well,
he got him in a standing good team and 

1579
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:31,361
he's putting them to sleep and all these
people are jumping in and saying,

1580
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,120
no wrestling,
no wrestling there.

1581
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,870
Literally pry in the two of them apart 
and Kimbo if you tuned it to begin,

1582
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,150
Kimbo was tuning them up in the 
beginning of the fight,

1583
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,530
but that guillotine,
man,

1584
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,780
if a guy's good and he gets you in a 
good tune,

1585
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,180
you're fucked because he's gonna.
He's gonna.

1586
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,430
He held onto that good team for about 30
or 40,

1587
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,220
so yeah.
Kimbos tired as fuck that.

1588
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:50,840
Yeah.
No one's saying anything when Kimbo shot

1589
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:55,841
for example,
but that was because Sean was battering 

1590
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:55,841
him by this point.
It was just cardio.

1591
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:57,710
Couldn't hang with the Cardio Kimbo shot
on him,

1592
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:58,610
which is crazy.
And then,

1593
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,870
you know,
see him there.

1594
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:02,060
Everybody's freaking out.
He couldn't hang with the cardio and you

1595
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:04,160
also couldn't have ganas.
Just an animal.

1596
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,350
That motherfucker could take punishment.
That,

1597
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,630
that was a tough jump.
That was a tough fight.

1598
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,860
I remember watching that back in the 
day.

1599
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:15,040
Well,
gannon started posting on the 

1600
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,040
underground from the hospital after this
fight.

1601
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,040
Over the day,
man,

1602
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,490
I watched this shit live on the 
Internet.

1603
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:20,270
It was like a paper view street.
He lost his job because he did something

1604
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:25,271
happened.
He got demoted or he got in trouble 

1605
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:25,271
something,
but he was a cop.

1606
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:27,840
That is the last motherfucker you want 
to rest in you.

1607
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:34,030
He's just so tough man.
Because Kimbo slice hit him with some 

1608
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,181
bombs.
His face was completely swollen and 

1609
01:01:37,181 --> 01:01:40,121
bloody by the end of the fight.
But that dude had just no give up in 

1610
01:01:40,121 --> 01:01:41,330
him.
And plus he had been used to MMA.

1611
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,910
You know,
he had been used to fighting with better

1612
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,160
plugs and not only that,
pacing himself,

1613
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,970
like Kimbo Kimbo just fighting dudes 
national.

1614
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:54,310
He just jumped out of the gate.
I mean Kimbo obviously had some good 

1615
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,981
punching skills,
but as far as like his defense and as 

1616
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:58,130
far as like his,
his ability to pace himself,

1617
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:03,131
like he was really way outclassed and 
Gannon started tuning them up with body 

1618
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:08,561
shots and slowly but surely he starts 
beating them down and by the end it's 

1619
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:10,880
absolutely brutal because they're giving
them these crazy counts to the game,

1620
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:12,710
like a 30 count or some shit like that.

1621
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,510
And they,
when the guy goes down,

1622
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:16,160
you don't follow him.
Like in mma,

1623
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,470
you got to let them get back up.
But I mean,

1624
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:23,471
he could have died easily.
Kimma was absolutely exhausted and he's 

1625
01:02:23,471 --> 01:02:25,110
getting just force fed knuckle 
sandwiches.

1626
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:31,310
But this was a,
this was a perfect indication that 

1627
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:31,310
although he became famous on the 
Internet,

1628
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:35,370
like he had a lot of growth to be 
fighting guys in the UFC.

1629
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,200
You know,
guys like Brandon Lee Hinkle,

1630
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:42,201
like national class wrestlers.
You been not getting up off your 

1631
01:02:42,201 --> 01:02:43,320
backside.
He got the guy gets you down.

1632
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,520
You're,
yeah,

1633
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,400
you're not getting up.
That's a terrible a type of match up.

1634
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:50,370
And so Gannon went in there against 
those guys too.

1635
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:52,670
He,
he fought permanently hinkle in,

1636
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,790
uh,
in the octagon.

1637
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,970
And kimbo fought.
He fought quite a few guys who actually 

1638
01:02:58,970 --> 01:02:58,970
did well.
He,

1639
01:02:58,970 --> 01:02:59,640
he,
he got better.

1640
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,280
He got better.
We still do.

1641
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,190
These guys have so many years on him.
He had some bad,

1642
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:07,320
nice to hae a Kimbo.
Had some serious arthritis in his knees.

1643
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,070
It goes crazy.
Band people never died on the wars.

1644
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,700
Like I remember.
I remember I was backstage members.

1645
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,080
Do you ever go to Draca?
Yeah,

1646
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,060
I went to the Olympic Auditorium.
I was like in high school,

1647
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,890
but I'll go there and like Kennedy with 
fight,

1648
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,240
I was at one one time and the guy from 
France fought and like of that until he 

1649
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,090
died.
Whoa.

1650
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,970
It was like,
what the fuck?

1651
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:27,840
Nothing happened.
It was like a,

1652
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:32,841
you know what I mean?
Like it wasn't like that where you 

1653
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:32,841
think,
oh,

1654
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:32,841
someone dies.
You wouldn't be surprised.

1655
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:32,841
Nothing happened.
You know?

1656
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:34,320
It's always those kind of weird fights.
People just die.

1657
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:35,940
There's die,
but the war is like,

1658
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,630
they're fine,
you know?

1659
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,180
Well,
they say that most of the people who die

1660
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,240
cut weight really say that.
Yeah.

1661
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:45,170
Most of the serious issues of brain 
death and,

1662
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:50,290
and real serious brain damage from a 
fight happens and the weight classes 

1663
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:53,370
below heavyweight.
But there was a recent fight on hbo were

1664
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,400
a guy wound up in the hospital with 
swelling and the blend some Russian 

1665
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,221
dude.
It was a ferocious beating and it was a 

1666
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:01,221
heavyweight fight.
It was a heavyweight fight.

1667
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:05,901
This Cuban Olympian and he,
he just beat the fucking shit out of 

1668
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:09,711
this Russian dude.
And the Russian dude was just 

1669
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:09,711
unbelievably tough.
Just kept coming.

1670
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:12,951
And his face was swollen out to here by 
the end of the fight and apparently he 

1671
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:14,490
had some serious brain swelling after 
the fight in his career is done.

1672
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,420
Yeah.
This shotgun.

1673
01:04:16,421 --> 01:04:18,240
And after that I was crazy.
Oh God.

1674
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:19,580
That's nuts.
That face.

1675
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:21,660
It's nuts.
And that's the winner,

1676
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,860
dude.
That's our share.

1677
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:25,120
Might look like after the first time.
Yeah.

1678
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,040
I was there because I was.
I was feeding him ice cream in the hotel

1679
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:28,790
room.
Yeah,

1680
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,680
because I drove with them and he was 
fucking

1681
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,090
up man.
He got beat up.

1682
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,660
He fought that fight with a torn acl 
too,

1683
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:36,160
right?
Yeah.

1684
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:38,570
I mean fighting a guy like tito with a 
torn acl.

1685
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:41,520
And Tito was Tito back then to now the 
tables on fire yet dude,

1686
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:43,020
Tito had,
in my opinion,

1687
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:48,021
still to this day has some of the best 
ground and pound from inside a guard 

1688
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:48,060
because he didn't even bother passing 
the guard.

1689
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,830
You weren't going to control his 
posture.

1690
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,890
He wasn't going to let you.
And he was just dropping elbows on you,

1691
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,300
smashing you from the top.
He battered can afford.

1692
01:04:55,830 --> 01:05:00,830
He had a lot of people could learn,
like there was a lot of people that 

1693
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,891
thought they had good guards and they 
had fight Tito and you get stuck in 

1694
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:03,891
between,
you know,

1695
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:04,470
he,
he was smashing guys from their guard.

1696
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:09,471
The guard didn't mean shit to Tito.
He never even got close to getting 

1697
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:09,471
caught.
I remember getting caught ever.

1698
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:10,800
He doesn't get enough credit.
That guy,

1699
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,080
you know,
a lot of it's because of things he says,

1700
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:18,081
you know,
a lot of it is a little fuck ups here 

1701
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:18,081
and there that he's done.
But like as a fighter,

1702
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,840
you know,
just because he couldn't beat chuck.

1703
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,940
Tito.
Tito was still a great fighter.

1704
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:22,870
Tina.
He doesn't,

1705
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:24,970
he doesn't get nearly enough credit.
Especially.

1706
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,890
I think he has some of the best ground 
and pound ever.

1707
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,920
Everyone wants you to lose it.
Ain't no suck.

1708
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,570
It sucks.
It sucks.

1709
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,280
It's just easy.
It's easy to shit on them,

1710
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:36,940
eh?
You know,

1711
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:40,750
that's the thing that's like sports shit
to sports radio.

1712
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,930
They love to shit on players.
The guy drops the ball,

1713
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:45,940
he's a fucking bomb.
They love to do that,

1714
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,100
but in the end it,
they apply it.

1715
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:52,101
They try to apply that shit to fighting 
and then you're dealing with a way more 

1716
01:05:52,101 --> 01:05:52,340
personal subject.
You know,

1717
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,780
the guy's a pussy.
He's scared of junior dos Santos.

1718
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:57,280
Let's just say it will just come out and
say it.

1719
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:58,900
Like,
why you talking like that?

1720
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:00,700
Like what do you know?
What are you saying?

1721
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,470
You know what?
How about you getting their stupid?

1722
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,890
You wouldn't be scared for junior dos 
Santos to punch in the face.

1723
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,250
You'd have to be crazy to not be scared.
Dude.

1724
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:11,530
I can't even.
I can't watch mma around civilians.

1725
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,080
You know what I mean?
Like they're fucking,

1726
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,840
they say the craziest shit.
You know what I mean?

1727
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:21,841
Do you find it like drunk?
Especially drunk white guys try to talk 

1728
01:06:21,841 --> 01:06:22,990
extra tough if they're watching MMA 
around you.

1729
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:23,920
Oh yeah.

1730
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:30,810
Oh No.
And then drunk guys sober.

1731
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,950
People don't do as much drunk.
They'll come with you right away.

1732
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,960
But it's always in wanting to tell 
stories of fights and fights.

1733
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:39,010
There's been no.
I did not want to talk about fighting.

1734
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:44,810
Not give a fuck about fighting.
I guess they feel like that's all you 

1735
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:44,810
can relate to.
It's like,

1736
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:44,810
dude,
I fucking train all day.

1737
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:45,970
I don't care about fighting.
I don't want to watch the fight.

1738
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:48,400
I want to talk about fighting like this.
Talk about that girl's ass.

1739
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:53,550
I have a friend,
I have a friend and her boyfriend 

1740
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:53,560
doesn't know anything about martial 
arts.

1741
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,430
He's never trained a day in his life and
he likes to watch fights,

1742
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,550
but when he watched his fights,
he,

1743
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:04,450
he starts like getting all aggressive 
and saying crazy shit and she gets mad.

1744
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,520
Know she's like,
this guy's a fucking pussy.

1745
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,370
I kicked this fucking guys.
That's guys push and she's like,

1746
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,690
will you shut the fuck up?
You ain't kicking.

1747
01:07:10,691 --> 01:07:12,400
Nobody's asked like,
why are you saying that?

1748
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,640
You know how annoying that is?
It is the word I'll give you this 

1749
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:17,640
fucking guy.
He's going to.

1750
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,270
So are you saying that it doesn't suck 
man?

1751
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:24,271
That's the perspective.
Get up the fuckers like you don't think 

1752
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:26,970
he wants to get up just laying there for
you.

1753
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,970
He wants to get up.
You can't.

1754
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,640
Fuck man.
Why isn't this knock him out?

1755
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:33,350
He's trying to knock them out.
What did he advise you to knock him out?

1756
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,720
It's so frustrating here.
And people critique fights when they 

1757
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:38,720
have no idea what they're talking about.
No,

1758
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,580
he's ever hit them.
You know,

1759
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:41,540
if there was enough and punched like 
what,

1760
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,300
what are you looking to punch you?
Knock.

1761
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,100
Like someone was telling me about the 
Chris Weidman.

1762
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,710
Chris Weidman.
Anderson Silva looked like a fixed fight

1763
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:48,280
to me,
bro.

1764
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:53,390
There was nothing punch.
He caught him perfectly on the end of 

1765
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:53,390
the chin.
Like,

1766
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:53,800
has anybody ever hit you in the end of 
your chin?

1767
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,720
Let me tell you what happens.
Your legs just go.

1768
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:56,440
We,
we,

1769
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,940
they just give it a,
you know,

1770
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:58,700
knock out.
So weird.

1771
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,810
Like you remember when um,
lawler lawler,

1772
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:02,550
India's.
Yes.

1773
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:05,050
There were slugging it out and he 
knocked him out.

1774
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:07,570
It was a week.
I mean it was like a little tip.

1775
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,010
Like it was a weird right hook.
Yeah,

1776
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:11,320
it was like a softer one.
It looks like nothing but it knocked him

1777
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,740
out.
I've been hit hardest elbow head.

1778
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:14,990
The weights in the gym.
Fine.

1779
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:20,260
And I've been dropped by a little guys 
because if it hits you in the right 

1780
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:20,480
spot,
you're just done.

1781
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,200
Yeah,
it's weird.

1782
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,770
Sometimes were punched.
Doesn't look like it should knock out.

1783
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:26,120
Like remember when Henzel gracie fought 
Dan Henderson.

1784
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,450
Hanzo is trying to shoot in on dance,
try to take him to the ground.

1785
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:31,100
And Dan uppercut him.
He hits somebody.

1786
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,580
It's like a upper cut,
almost like his wrist and,

1787
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:38,630
and hence went out and like,
so could you versus a little knock.

1788
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,640
Same Shit.
He hit him with a punch but he didn't 

1789
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:43,640
even land the punch.
He hit him with his wrist and he knocked

1790
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,210
him out.
You know.

1791
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:48,440
That's why I like people like I use the 
term lucky punch.

1792
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:49,640
I don't call it,
use it.

1793
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:51,140
People say it was because you through 
it.

1794
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,490
Yeah.
Guess what though?

1795
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:57,630
He through 65 hard ones that didn't do 
shit and those software knocked them 

1796
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:57,650
out.
It's a lucky punch.

1797
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,300
You know?
I've seen guys were like,

1798
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:02,270
I'm beating up the whole fight as a last
minute left.

1799
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,830
And you close your eyes and overhand 
right.

1800
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:04,340
Knocked me out.

1801
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,080
So lucky punch.
Do you know what I mean?

1802
01:09:06,081 --> 01:09:08,330
Like the sex thing sort of,
but then again,

1803
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:09,620
okay,
here's a perfect example.

1804
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:14,621
Like Marcus Davis and Jeremy Stevens.
Marcus Davis was outbox and Jeremy 

1805
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:19,900
Stevens,
but Jeremy Stevens landed a few good 

1806
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,181
shots but not enough to put them away 
and then finally in the third round hit 

1807
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:26,021
him with just his haymaker from Jupiter 
and landed right on his chin and Marcus 

1808
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:27,440
was stretched.
He was out cold,

1809
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,870
but I mean he hit him with all these 
punches before it didn't do it,

1810
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:31,610
but he was looking for that perfect 
punch.

1811
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,290
That's not a,
that's not a lucky,

1812
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,930
but you know,
but sometimes there are a few.

1813
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,310
Yeah.
And just like fuck,

1814
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:40,370
like weird shit happens.
When Matt Hughes Fought Matt Serra,

1815
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:42,620
they collided heads and Matt Hughes went
down.

1816
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:44,600
He thought he got punched but it was 
like a head.

1817
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,060
But that dropped and he went to the 
corner.

1818
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:46,760
It's like,
what hit me?

1819
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,110
Did I get,
did I get dropped?

1820
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,940
And like they thought he got hit by a 
punch,

1821
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:54,941
but we watched it in the replay.
You could see they'd collide heads and 

1822
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:54,941
he,
he,

1823
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:54,941
he,
he gets dropped from that.

1824
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:55,250
Yeah.
You know,

1825
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:00,400
there's a.
and that's why I think standup a little 

1826
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:00,500
more shaky because there's,
there's more luck than standup.

1827
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,810
Yeah.
Then there isn't wrestling and Jujitsu.

1828
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,960
There's also more.
What's important is like things that 

1829
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,771
you're physically born with,
like reach and athleticism and fast 

1830
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,260
twitch muscle fibers that come into play
way more with standup.

1831
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,750
Whereas a guy can get real good once 
you.

1832
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:18,140
If you teach a guy the fundamentals of 
striking and he's a long tall guy,

1833
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,240
you know,
he could get real good,

1834
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:23,390
real effective real quick as opposed to 
a short,

1835
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:27,320
fat white guy who's good short ass arms 
and you're fucked man.

1836
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,620
You the physical.
But that short guy,

1837
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:35,621
if they were just rolling,
if that guy was a wicked black belt in 

1838
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:35,621
Jujitsu,
just knows positioning.

1839
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:38,840
He could just run around that dude time 
up in a knot and do whatever he wants to

1840
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:39,500
them.
Yeah.

1841
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,690
So you can get like a black belt in 
striking.

1842
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,840
You don't have to be as athletic.
Yeah,

1843
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,310
I mean,
but that's the weird thing too,

1844
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,020
like with me and Brian were talking 
about it,

1845
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,660
about like uh,
the end of the day,

1846
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:54,470
everything's genetics.
Like we know right away the race horses,

1847
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:56,180
bloodline,
the fighting dogs,

1848
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,230
bloodline,
[inaudible] fighting,

1849
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:57,980
roosters,
bloodline,

1850
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:03,070
it's all blurred.
Those are the best animals were a 

1851
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:03,070
fucking animal.
So like it comes a lot.

1852
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:05,830
Like some guys are freaks while they 
fixed because genetically they're just,

1853
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,370
they're magic,
you know what I mean?

1854
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:10,010
So it's like Bj Penn.
Yeah,

1855
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,850
he's,
I don't know,

1856
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:11,910
George Foreman.
Yeah.

1857
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,890
These guys are just fucking freaks.
So you know,

1858
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:14,180
uh,

1859
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,370
you can want to get so good dude.
It's like,

1860
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:22,410
It's like,
to me like Jeremy Horn is an example of 

1861
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:22,410
someone that's a great fighter really 
tight.

1862
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,380
The,
he went as far as you could go off skill

1863
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,110
and an effort,
but he'd never had the athleticism.

1864
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:33,290
You know what I mean?
Where if you put that skill into st 

1865
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:33,780
pierre or pg pan,
they would kill everyone.

1866
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:37,140
You know what I mean?
Genetics is a lot.

1867
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,990
That's why the perfect storm is a guy 
like gsp.

1868
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:44,991
You has the genetics and works like a 
motherFucker and is smart and most guys 

1869
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:45,340
that had the genetics,
you're lazy like bj.

1870
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:46,900
Yeah,
and I mean,

1871
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,030
well it's interesting seeing bj come 
back now because bj is going to fight at

1872
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:52,790
1:45
and he's already down to like 1:55

1873
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,790
and he's already in the fifties.
I've seen pictures on me skinnY as shit.

1874
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,380
It's crazy.
It's just,

1875
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,470
I don't know,
like those last few fights like the nick

1876
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:05,471
diaz fight and the Roy Macdonald fight,
like what kind of a beating he took in 

1877
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:08,660
those fights.
FighTs were like first round effort and 

1878
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,280
then shut down and then it was like he 
was trying to win,

1879
01:12:10,281 --> 01:12:13,040
but it was basically on survival mode 
for rounds two and three.

1880
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:18,220
There were two fights.
He should have never taken against one 

1881
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,090
seventies.
I mean the fact that he's now at 1:45

1882
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:25,091
is just so crazy that he just is so 
extreme goes from I'm not going to cut 

1883
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,451
weight,
I'm just going to fight anybody at one 

1884
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:29,720
70 and then I'm fighting at 1:45.
That's a giant difference.

1885
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:31,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

1886
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,750
But he's one guy that I think maybe 
should be lighter,

1887
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,510
other other guys cut weight and it's 
like,

1888
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:38,820
dude,
it's not.

1889
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,220
The answer was like,
why don't you go to 50 fives?

1890
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:47,200
Because I don't think I'm gonna do.
But if 55 to 87,

1891
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,180
I'm fucking lean.
Fifty five.

1892
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,530
Can I make it?
Yeah,

1893
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,530
I could.
But am I going be better that?

1894
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:54,270
I don't think so.
I think it's always the curious,

1895
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,960
like really weak.
I was just talking to john,

1896
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,050
alyssa,
we started yesterday and I said,

1897
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,090
man,
you can stay at 55.

1898
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:01,480
He waS like,
fuck,

1899
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:03,880
I don't know man.
He said that at one 70 was always small.

1900
01:13:03,881 --> 01:13:07,960
Like alessio in shape is like one 75,
like perfectly in shape.

1901
01:13:07,961 --> 01:13:09,460
But he was like,
I'm smaller one the 50 fives.

1902
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:14,730
He said 70.
No one ever muscled me around and $55 I 

1903
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:15,030
told them to get manhandled.
So it gives is weak.

1904
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,460
It isn't always the cure.
Like everybody wants to go lower,

1905
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:18,900
lower,
lower,

1906
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,450
lower,
lower.

1907
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:20,500
But I don't think it's.

1908
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,120
Look at cane.
Yeah,

1909
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:27,570
40 but a little fat on him and he be the
best headwinds for small look at federal

1910
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,120
with small gains.
Small.

1911
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,050
Randy was tiny.

1912
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,730
Yup.
And they're fighting giants.

1913
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:34,470
So like if I want,
if I find one 70 and the guys 10,

1914
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,500
12 pounds heavier than me,
it ain't heavyweights lift 30 pounds 

1915
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:39,500
heavier,
they're fine.

1916
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,360
Well the thing about those really big 
heavyweights is they can't keep the 

1917
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,881
pace.
They just can't keep that kind of a 

1918
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:45,881
pace.
You saw with shane carwyn,

1919
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:48,200
so brock lesnar see with allister they 
can't keep that pace.

1920
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:53,201
There's too much muscle to feed.
You can't keep that cain velasquez pain 

1921
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:53,201
because people,

1922
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:55,550
people think our hearts and lungs are 
kinda all the same size.

1923
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,760
Your body might be bigger,
but you're the same size,

1924
01:13:58,761 --> 01:14:00,200
heart and lung.
We got to feed that muscle.

1925
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:05,410
Yeah,
that's a weird thing that people don't 

1926
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:05,410
really understand.
They see a guy,

1927
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:05,410
they go,
well,

1928
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,050
you know,
he's just got to get In better shape.

1929
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:11,590
You know,
he's got a fucking 500 horsepower 

1930
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,590
engine.
He's got three gallons of gas.

1931
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,990
That's just what you got.
Your heart

1932
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,680
and lungs are or uniform.
You don't.

1933
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:18,690
Yeah,
because no matter how big words that 

1934
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:18,690
it's like,
it's like you're like a weaned dude.

1935
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:19,060
Like john doesn't have a huge dick 
guaranteed.

1936
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:19,820
You know,
this is true.

1937
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,820
It doesn't go.
It would be giant in comparison.

1938
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,100
Most likely.
Maybe like shaquille o'neal.

1939
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,440
Someone told me he had a little deck.
I told him to shut the fuck up.

1940
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,760
First of all,
you've got to show me a picture.

1941
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:29,920
You can't talk shit like that.
Second of all,

1942
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:31,210
little dick.
Compared to what?

1943
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,170
What is he like,
Jay?

1944
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,720
So imagine if shaquille o'neal is so 
humongous.

1945
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,480
Like say you had eight inch dick,
big dick.

1946
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,960
It's kinda like tanya,
I should feel like he has to have like a

1947
01:14:40,961 --> 01:14:43,000
15 inch dick to make it look normal.
It's true.

1948
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:43,750
You know what I mean?
So,

1949
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,370
but you know,
tHe lungs,

1950
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:48,180
lungs,
hearts and dick's the big.

1951
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,270
Well big guys have bigger lungs.
Don't think.

1952
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:53,350
I mean you must,
you must have a larger heart too.

1953
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,540
I don't think it's that much bigger.
I don't know.

1954
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,350
Like I like shaquille o'neal.
I mean,

1955
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:02,430
because think about your heart,
tony hinchcliffe say they say the size 

1956
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:02,430
of your fist,
right?

1957
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:06,060
Right.
Well your fist came with that much 

1958
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,060
bigger.
Maybe it's a little bigger,

1959
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,630
but 50,
60 pounds heavier.

1960
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,900
Well that sucks for people with little 
hands and they got little last hearts 

1961
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,350
because you know,
you know some dudes he likes to see 

1962
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:16,350
their face and you're like,
wow,

1963
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:16,600
this is crazy.
That's always what I hear.

1964
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:18,160
I don't know if it's true,
but it can't.

1965
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,780
I think they're about the same size of 
the heart.

1966
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:24,810
Well either way there's not that much of
a variation and the amount of variation 

1967
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,270
in muscle mass that people put on,
it's pretty huge.

1968
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,820
Like if I'm,
if I'm one 75 makoto,

1969
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,810
is gonna be better than if I'm fucking 
2:35,

1970
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:35,890
I'll be able to like see guys that carry
muscle mass and then they use it though.

1971
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:40,891
Like hector lombard.
He's a scary motherfucker with a lot of 

1972
01:15:40,891 --> 01:15:40,891
mass.
There's a few guys that like break those

1973
01:15:40,891 --> 01:15:43,300
rules.
Even mountain has good cardio.

1974
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,310
Not bad.
We saw so,

1975
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:50,160
so [inaudible] been in the game so long 
he can relax and that's a big part of of

1976
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,210
fighting.
It's just being able to relax.

1977
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,400
It's brain brains the most of your 
cardio,

1978
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:58,290
keeping your mind like for example,
my name is right.

1979
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,640
He has the obstacle course record at 
bud's.

1980
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,520
He's.
He can do any snowshoe marathons.

1981
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,850
He can do crazy.
All kinds of circuits beat everybody 

1982
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:08,850
right,
but I'm one of five minute round.

1983
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:11,620
He's going To die like a funny.
Yeah.

1984
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,130
I'm like,
dude,

1985
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,120
we could wrestle.

1986
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,190
he could run.
He could wrestle all day,

1987
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:18,580
but as soon as he's punching involved,
five minutes tightens up.

1988
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,780
He's bed.
Dude,

1989
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:24,781
you can run a marathon yet you can't 
fucking spot dead brain is everything 

1990
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:30,750
that nick diaz had the press style for 
that getting guys exhausted because he 

1991
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:30,940
wouldn't let him breathe,
and that's what people say.

1992
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,220
Nightmare.
When when someone's punching you,

1993
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,980
even if there's a little punches,
you can't relax.

1994
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,250
You need to relax so you're holding your
breath all the time.

1995
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:43,330
He's hitting you cleansing.
Within 30 seconds of that,

1996
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:48,331
you're fucking exhausted and all those 
little 50 percent punches start adding 

1997
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:50,140
up to nick diaz is a is a nightmare.
Yeah.

1998
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:51,760
Nick is one of the biggest nightmares 
ever.

1999
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,950
He's probably the last person I want to 
fight,

2000
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,350
like if I want to fight the same period.
Yes.

2001
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,850
Same here all day.
Really?

2002
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,710
Yeah.
Diaz.

2003
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,560
Just for my style at least it's a 
nightmare because he don't know.

2004
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:03,150
Man.
I don't.

2005
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,000
I don't.
I don't go.

2006
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:06,610
I don't have to go backwards to go 
forward with him.

2007
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,840
He goes forward too much.
He's too good at it.

2008
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,010
He's a nightmare to me.
I don't

2009
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,550
know.
He's.

2010
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,060
He revolutionized in my opinion that 
like that style striking.

2011
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:19,061
You never saw that before.
Like guys are throwing like 50 percent 

2012
01:17:19,061 --> 01:17:20,000
punches and just staying on you and just
hitting you with volume.

2013
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,840
It's crazy like that.
That was the style that didn't exist 

2014
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:25,840
before.
It looks.

2015
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:25,840
It looks like gum.
Yeah.

2016
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,480
It looks weird but it kicks ass when you
saw like guys melt,

2017
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:31,460
like,
like frank shamrock,

2018
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:36,490
frank shamrock melted.
He just melted under that barrage and 

2019
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:36,490
he's talking shit and frank can't 
breathe.

2020
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,090
And he's punched him in the face,
what bitch,

2021
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:40,610
what pitch?
Eat that bitch and he's knuckle sandwich

2022
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:45,611
and I'm kicking his ass and then frank 
can't believe that he's getting his ass 

2023
01:17:45,611 --> 01:17:49,241
kicked and he's getting talked shit to 
like this on tv and he realized I'm not 

2024
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:54,311
going to beat this fucking guy and he 
can't breathe because he's not getting 

2025
01:17:54,311 --> 01:17:54,311
any breath because nick's hitting them 
with 30,

2026
01:17:54,311 --> 01:17:55,370
40 fucking punches a minute.

2027
01:17:55,370 --> 01:18:00,370
Just not that type.
He has a difficult style to deal with.

2028
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,420
Yeah.
He's throwing 150 punches.

2029
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:04,940
Hitting you with 31 thing with nick is 
like,

2030
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:08,750
like period them easier because nick's 
weaknesses.

2031
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:09,840
Wrestling.
Yeah.

2032
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,390
As long as you can.
Especially it'd be fine.

2033
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:12,450
I can wrestle him down,
you know?

2034
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,590
Yeah.
Uh,

2035
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,140
but on the feet man,
nightmare.

2036
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:20,230
Nasty potty shots too.
I was going to say is that 30 of his 

2037
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,090
punches are going to be hard punches to 
the body and he,

2038
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:26,100
he throws those fishes,
hooks to the body and lulls you to 

2039
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:26,960
sleep.
But a few pitty pat and then boom,

2040
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,760
uhm,
the hooks to the body,

2041
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,370
the paul daily fights.
Another perfect example of that.

2042
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,600
Oh yeah.
And he can.

2043
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,170
That's the other thing about nick is 
that he'd take a fucking serious punch.

2044
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:41,230
Do you see him?
He'll be pitter pattering Whack it 

2045
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:41,230
cracked.

2046
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:41,950
Go right back.
Because he was just right back there.

2047
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,040
Just lets you know.
So what,

2048
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,630
so what bitch.
So you hit me bitch,

2049
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:50,020
you know,
and then you see them extending their 

2050
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:50,020
hands to like when he fought cause 
content and he,

2051
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,870
he literally bitch slapped him.
He just opened palm,

2052
01:18:51,871 --> 01:18:53,600
slapped him in the face.
I mean,

2053
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:55,730
who does that?
Who talks so much shit.

2054
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,700
I love nick diaz is one of my favorites 
of all time.

2055
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,840
One of my favorites.
It just uh,

2056
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,570
it's interesting to see different styles
and how those styles play out and see if

2057
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:07,220
people could find a solution.
You know,

2058
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:11,440
george found a solution to that style 
but never came close to finishing them.

2059
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,280
Never,
never really put them in danger.

2060
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,710
It was like a very safety first version 
of that.

2061
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,260
Yeah.
Know what I'm happy about is lawler.

2062
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:20,240
Dude.
What a resurgence.

2063
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,860
I'm happy him for him to come back.
It's awesome.

2064
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:26,861
Like,
I don't know where like I thought I 

2065
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:26,861
haven't even,
I never thought I waS going to come back

2066
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:27,110
with that.
He's smashing everyone to see if you can

2067
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:30,110
find online robbie lawler versus melvin 
manhoef.

2068
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,020
That's my favorite robbie lawler fight.
That was in strikeforce.

2069
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,010
I know.
It's a scary dude.

2070
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,780
Oh,
first of all,

2071
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,790
the dudes,
the blackest man on the Planet.

2072
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,010
Okay.
He's black as coal.

2073
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:45,100
He's built like a fucking superhero.
He throws the nastiest kicks and 

2074
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:45,100
punches.
Nasty.

2075
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,990
He's the only guy to ever knocked Mark 
Hunt out in the first round with one 

2076
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,200
Punch and he's a 100 and eiGhty five 
Pounds,

2077
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,840
which is fucking crazy.
They fought in mma.

2078
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:56,180
Mark hunt shot in on him.
I mean,

2079
01:19:56,181 --> 01:20:00,860
that's the tells you how fucking scary.
Melvin manhoef is he just a spring,

2080
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,450
just a steel spring.

2081
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,820
Just coiled back.
Ready to fucking explode on you.

2082
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:08,580
So anyway,
he's teeing off robbie lawler fucking up

2083
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:13,581
his legs.
Got robbie's not checking any of these 

2084
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:13,581
kicks and he's sitting in with these 
inside low kicks,

2085
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:16,710
had got robbed.
His legs literally flying up in the air.

2086
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:22,130
And then robbie uncorked haymaker losing
every minute of the fight up until the 

2087
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:29,181
moment he uncorked punch and melvin's 
eyes just roll way back into his head.

2088
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:30,600
And that's the end of it.
Yeah.

2089
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:35,601
This is the fight right here.
This is one of my all time favorite 

2090
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:36,540
robbie lawler fights because he was 
getting.

2091
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,430
See how his legs are flying up in the 
air.

2092
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:43,800
And melvin manhoef is one of the best 
kickboxer boom there.

2093
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:48,801
It is.
One of the best kick boxers to come out 

2094
01:20:48,801 --> 01:20:51,360
of one of the best gyms.
He was one of the guys from mike's gym,

2095
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:56,361
whereas that's where alastaIr started 
training recently when he rebuilt 

2096
01:20:56,361 --> 01:20:57,330
himself.
Mike.

2097
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:00,960
Mike is responsible for badr hari.
He's got coconut saki over there.

2098
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:03,330
A lot of those high level high level 
guys from holland,

2099
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,100
lola,
go con socrates,

2100
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,830
go contact your golden glory.
No,

2101
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:11,070
I don't know either way.
Badass fighters over there,

2102
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:14,160
but robbie lawler,
he always has that one punch power,

2103
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:18,400
durable and tough.
And he doesn't give a fuck who literally

2104
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,400
legitimate doesn't give a fuck.
Dana told me,

2105
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:25,401
they called robbie lawler,
told him you got a title shot against 

2106
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:25,401
johny hendricks is for the welterweight 
title.

2107
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:25,890
He goes,
cool.

2108
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,500
That's it,
you know,

2109
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:29,950
do a,
he's a nice guy.

2110
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:32,370
I like him,
but to me it's kind of like a bimbo,

2111
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:40,070
like he's like,
he's like simple and so nice and like 

2112
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,070
he's like a bimbo,
like arrowhead,

2113
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,990
you know,
it's funny.

2114
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,630
I don't know,
that's what I always got off.

2115
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:42,930
Um,
you know,

2116
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:44,790
uh,
I've had conversations with them.

2117
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:47,630
He's not stupid but he's just like,
like real,

2118
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:48,260
like,
I don't know,

2119
01:21:48,261 --> 01:21:52,320
you just like quiet and like he's kinda 
like kinda like a bimbo.

2120
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,470
I never talked to him that much.
I know what you're saying,

2121
01:21:55,471 --> 01:22:00,471
but that's just perception.
So I know I talked to him for a long 

2122
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:03,531
time because he was on,
he was one of the coaches fault or 

2123
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:03,531
fighter when I was on there.
Oh,

2124
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:06,190
real other team.
So he was like real nice and like he 

2125
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:06,190
just seemed like,
you know.

2126
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:06,190
Yeah.
Who,

2127
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:06,720
what team were you on?
I was on sarah,

2128
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:07,910
sarah,
and he was on here,

2129
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,600
but he's like,
because he would always tell me back,

2130
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:10,840
tell me,
uh,

2131
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,420
the lord isn't spar.
I'm like,

2132
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:13,020
yeah,
riGht dude,

2133
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,520
laura's probably only,
there's this boy,

2134
01:22:14,521 --> 01:22:16,380
he's a striker.
So I asked him on the shoulder.

2135
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,960
He was like,
nah man,

2136
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:19,830
why would.
I was like,

2137
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,450
I know how to fight.
I just like,

2138
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,450
what?
You serious dude?

2139
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:26,390
So yeah man,
I wrestled when I run,

2140
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,130
I lift weights,
but it was like I don't spot,

2141
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,520
I know how to fight already.
Like wow,

2142
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,750
that's part of said it was just funny.
I was like,

2143
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:34,260
it just seemed like a,
just like a,

2144
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:35,760
like a rock,
like just like,

2145
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:37,130
you know,
like seeing her.

2146
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,320
I was like,
but pretty,

2147
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:43,330
you know,
he's a nice guy but he just tough 

2148
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:43,330
faster.
BuT you don't it as a spark.

2149
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:45,930
What do you think about that?
Because is that maybe a way to do it?

2150
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,130
Like you don't take any damage so you go
into a fight and you haven't been hit at

2151
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:55,131
all,
you know how to hit people and you know 

2152
01:22:55,131 --> 01:22:55,131
how to get hit.
You've been doing it for years.

2153
01:22:55,131 --> 01:22:58,941
If you just stop now,
how much timing would you lose if you 

2154
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:01,611
did like a lot of work and you just 
concentrated on drills with a real good 

2155
01:23:01,611 --> 01:23:01,611
striking coach?

2156
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,010
I wouldn't do it because I know one way 
from the judges

2157
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:10,330
by jail when he came on a jail like the 
first couple of weeks,

2158
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:11,890
few weeks of sparring.
I like.

2159
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:15,040
I'm like flinchy and like I'm like 
flexing and he didn't get to do anything

2160
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:15,790
in jail though,
right?

2161
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:20,850
Yeah.
All in all I could do there with 

2162
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:20,850
shadowboxing,
like pushups and squats.

2163
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:23,350
I couldn't really work out.
I know that's crazy.

2164
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:26,580
I wouldn't do it like me.
I only once a week just just,

2165
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:29,110
just tuesdays and like with a little bit
like I said,

2166
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,160
and that's it,
you know,

2167
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,570
put ice,
do three days a week,

2168
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,130
three days a week,
but it's too much I think.

2169
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:34,510
I don't think you need to do that much.
Yeah.

2170
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:37,600
This is a point of diminishinG returnS,
esPecially with taking shots.

2171
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:40,660
EverYone who gets hurt in practice,
you know what I mean?

2172
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:45,661
so I would spend more time doing other 
stuff that's less dangerous and um,

2173
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:50,960
you know,
running and stuff like that because I 

2174
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,681
think in the beginning when you're new,
I think it's important to spar because 

2175
01:23:52,681 --> 01:23:57,061
you can get comfortable once you get 
comfortable is less important because 

2176
01:23:57,061 --> 01:23:59,110
you're relaxed and you're not,
you're not nervous no more and stuff.

2177
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:04,140
So much of it is also dependent upon 
finding people that you could trust a 

2178
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:04,140
spar with.
Like there was a,

2179
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:07,120
when I first moved to hollywood in 
[inaudible] 94,

2180
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:12,121
I was training at the jet center and a 
bunch of real cool guys there and there 

2181
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:14,230
was a bunch of real cool guys to spar 
with.

2182
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,540
Was this one dude in particular?
I forget his name.

2183
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:17,650
I think his name was ed,
I forget,

2184
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:22,980
but he was an older dude,
me and that duty spar all the time 

2185
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:25,921
because I knew that he would never try 
to tee off on me and he knew that I'd 

2186
01:24:25,921 --> 01:24:27,430
never tried tee off on him.
Everything was like 50 percent always.

2187
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:28,390
He never,
he was never,

2188
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,520
you know,
some dudes will 50 percent you and then 

2189
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:33,520
hit you with some shit and be like,
come on man,

2190
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,711
what are we doing here?
Are we fight and we spark and the next 

2191
01:24:37,711 --> 01:24:37,711
thing that you try to get them back.

2192
01:24:37,711 --> 01:24:38,920
next thing you know,
you're in a wall in berlin and you know,

2193
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:40,300
in your brain up,
you know,

2194
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,050
I don't believe that you need a spar 
hard.

2195
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:43,870
I don't think so either.
What I was going to say is this,

2196
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,620
I got better with this guy.
my sparring got sharper,

2197
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:52,621
my reflexes has got sharper because I 
was constantly sparring with this dude 

2198
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,230
where I wasn't worried about getting 
knocked out in,

2199
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:54,880
in our training sessions.
You know,

2200
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,300
it's uh,
you know,

2201
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,400
either you're tough,
you're not dude,

2202
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:59,020
so you didn't get hit and you're gonna 
be a poster,

2203
01:24:59,021 --> 01:25:00,130
you're going to get hit and you're going
to take it.

2204
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:04,720
And by that standard and you think 
robbie lawler has got a point.

2205
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:07,370
Do you think maybe his style of,
of not sparring it all,

2206
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,400
it'll be a good idea for him,
for him?

2207
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:10,300
Yeah.
Well that's it,

2208
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:10,570
right?

2209
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,370
Find what works for you,
you know,

2210
01:25:12,371 --> 01:25:17,371
like some guys,
I think you could get away with it more 

2211
01:25:17,371 --> 01:25:17,371
than others,
but uh,

2212
01:25:17,371 --> 01:25:17,620
I wouldn't feel comfortable confident 
doing it.

2213
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,440
I've never heard the one I was doing 
that except for him.

2214
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:21,370
Yeah,
I wonder.

2215
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,450
I mean,
who knows,

2216
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,880
he might just be bullshitting.
He might like to spread rumors,

2217
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:30,340
but he,
he was living with me for a little bit 

2218
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:30,340
in vegas like million back in the day.
so bernie,

2219
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,810
that didn't spark and I was like,
fucking bullshit dude.

2220
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,370
He asked us was probably only wants to 
do a spoiler,

2221
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:35,560
but.
So he needed confirmed it.

2222
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:36,310
So I don't know,
dude,

2223
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:38,650
I got to ask him,
but that's really interesting man.

2224
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,350
That's really interesting.
But uh,

2225
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:44,810
he's a scary fucking finisher though.
The check and he fought koscheck.

2226
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:45,610
I mean,
the way he fights,

2227
01:25:45,611 --> 01:25:47,050
he doesn't,
he doesn't need this part obviously.

2228
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:50,620
And maybe that'll save his brand in the 
long run.

2229
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,210
That's what I'm saying.
You get hit.

2230
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:55,570
That's the problem with boxers is that 
they only punch.

2231
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:59,560
So they're getting hit in the head all 
the time and practice and the fight.

2232
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,700
So they get more brain damage than us,
you know,

2233
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:05,540
I was probably once a week and I through
come dipping a hard.

2234
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,220
When you see guys like,
um,

2235
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:09,740
like meldrick taylor,
does that freak you out?

2236
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,030
It's scary dude.
It freaked me out man.

2237
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,640
I stopped sparring when I was in my 
twenties.

2238
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:21,730
I haven't done any sparring.
I'm 46 years old now and I still wonder 

2239
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,710
if what I did when I was younger,
like maybe it would have been smarter,

2240
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,450
maybe I wouldn't have been so weird.
Like,

2241
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:27,890
you know,
it can't be good at hitting the head.

2242
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,650
Can't be,
you know what I mean?

2243
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:34,660
That's why you got to accept the fact 
you got to be careful with yourself and 

2244
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:34,660
you got to be smart.

2245
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,400
Like for example,
um,

2246
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:40,990
last week I was sparring with evan 
dunham and I shot at the exact same time

2247
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,470
he kicked.
It was like a fluke accident.

2248
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,180
Super common though.
Yeah.

2249
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:48,080
And boom,
dude,

2250
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:53,081
I was on my,
I'm gonna ask like I was like pretty 

2251
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:53,480
much almost out,
you know.

2252
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:53,930
And he's like,
sorry,

2253
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:55,420
bad timing.
Oh,

2254
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,740
what was this?
When did this happen last week?

2255
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,050
Now what do you do when,
when something like that happens,

2256
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:04,460
how much time do you take off as barn?
Depending on how I feel afterwards,

2257
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:08,240
but like I took the whole week out,
but I was the only tuesdays anyway.

2258
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:12,530
But um,
if I would've been dizzy like that night

2259
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,560
still afterwards and the next day I 
wouldn't have spotted for a couple of 

2260
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:17,560
weeks Because that's how you lose your 
chin.

2261
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:17,840
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2262
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,870
But then it sucked because then like I,
like I said I was fine.

2263
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,780
It was that that night I was already 
fine.

2264
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:24,680
It was a big deal.
But um,

2265
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,970
then on tuesday we got this fucking 
silver medalist olympic,

2266
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,550
a guy from Denmark,
from martin cameron's buddy,

2267
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,180
he's a silver medalist and he's,
he's,

2268
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,930
he's officer no quicker,
ruined wrestler.

2269
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:39,560
So it was probably with this guy 
yesterday and he stand up,

2270
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:44,561
isn't that good yet?
So I'm going to software and I don't 

2271
01:27:44,561 --> 01:27:44,561
want to be a dick,
you know,

2272
01:27:44,561 --> 01:27:48,730
but then he took me down double leg and 
I was good up on the fence and that 

2273
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,060
motherfucker suplex me on my head,
dude.

2274
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,300
And uh,
I got,

2275
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,910
I got rocked pretty good but not,
you know,

2276
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,820
it was like a,
I was like,

2277
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:58,970
that's what people don't realize this,
this shit is happening all day,

2278
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,660
but you got to be able to judge like 
saved at that.

2279
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:06,170
SaY if a evan dunham that happened in my
last round last tuesday,

2280
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:08,260
if that was my first round,
I would always stop for today.

2281
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:13,810
If you get,
if you get dropped or knocked out a 

2282
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:14,210
rock,
don't or don't be tough.

2283
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:17,100
Fucking take the day off because you're 
gonna do more damage.

2284
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,740
Your brain has to recover a little bit,
you know.

2285
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:21,710
Not only that,
I mean you really need more than a day.

2286
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:23,310
You probably need a long time.
A while.

2287
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:25,370
I'm just kind of fucking crazy and at 
least a week.

2288
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:30,440
But I've seen like some guys will get 
dropped and they'll take like a man 

2289
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:30,950
often despised the next round.
Done for the day.

2290
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,990
Blacks.
It ain't gonna benefit you,

2291
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:38,290
you,
I've seen guys get knocked out cold in 

2292
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:38,540
boxing gym.
They spar him later and he's like you to

2293
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:39,330
do it now?
Fuck you.

2294
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,540
Get Back on the horse.
Don't be scared to get back on the horse

2295
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:43,600
and you see him spar and they're like,
yeah,

2296
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,730
and then they get jazzed to get going on
and get jobs in Iraq.

2297
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Well that there's been a couple 
instances in the ufc where guys get 

2298
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,911
knocked out in training camp and they 
completed their camp and fought travis 

2299
01:28:54,911 --> 01:28:55,040
luder when he knocked out,
um,

2300
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:57,860
a marvin eastman.
Remember that fight?

2301
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,560
Marvin eastman got knocked out twice in 
camp.

2302
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,130
He was trained with tito

2303
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,130
and he got knocked out by a knee during 
the takedown and another time that was 

2304
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:07,520
something else,
like during a take down,

2305
01:29:07,521 --> 01:29:10,080
he got knocked out.
So you've been concussed out.

2306
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:14,580
Cold twice in camp and then fought.
And travis luder caught him with the end

2307
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:16,260
of this punch.
It was kind of crazy.

2308
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,110
It was one of the weirdest knock on 
saturday.

2309
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,670
Yeah.
It caught him like pull.

2310
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:24,740
Pull that up.
Travis luder versus martin king never 

2311
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:24,740
knocked the other one in his life.
And he's a digital guy.

2312
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,810
Travis luder versus marvin eastman and 
these east.

2313
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:27,450
Well,
you know,

2314
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,430
louis luder could punch.
He's a strong dude.

2315
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:30,060
I mean.
Oh yeah,

2316
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:30,800
yeah.
I mean,

2317
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,840
he's a guy and these ones that striker.
So you thought he was gonna take him 

2318
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:35,840
down to try.
You know,

2319
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,210
he's one of,
in my opinion,

2320
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:41,240
look,
the guys that like didn't reach his 

2321
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:41,240
potential.
That makes me go.

2322
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:41,280
He's fucking lazy.
Lazy,

2323
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:44,370
lazy,
like wouldn't leave his gym like trained

2324
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:47,960
with the students and shit like that.
He was smashing anderson silva.

2325
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,150
Yeah.
And he gassed.

2326
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,550
Yeah.
Here's travis right here.

2327
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,290
I mean,
that's crazy.

2328
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:55,500
We'll show that one more time Because it
doesn't even make sense,

2329
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,990
but it's not like people.
You might think it was fake.

2330
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:03,380
Watch this.
He hits him with this punch.

2331
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:10,030
Here it is.
That's crazy.

2332
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:11,830
It barely hits.
It's like a grazed.

2333
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:15,070
Him at the very end of the punch.
And marvin eastman had just been

2334
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,730
so damaged and training.
He just went out cold.

2335
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:20,940
But travis luder was a wicked jujitsu 
guy,

2336
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,730
dominated everybody in the house.
When you see,

2337
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:25,740
when he was fighting on the ultimate 
fighter dude,

2338
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:30,480
his fucking takedowns,
his jujitsu is laser sharp and he fucked

2339
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:34,560
up and he fought anderson silva.
He lost so much weight.

2340
01:30:34,561 --> 01:30:39,561
Dude.
I never seen a guys I lost so closer to 

2341
01:30:39,561 --> 01:30:39,561
death than the weigh ins for travis 
luder.

2342
01:30:39,561 --> 01:30:44,231
He never made the weight.
He never made the way to miss the way 

2343
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,720
was a non title fight when he fought 
anderson and when he got on that scale,

2344
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:50,721
man,
his lips were cracked and bleeding he's 

2345
01:30:50,721 --> 01:30:53,860
faced was completely sucked in.
There was no water in his body and he 

2346
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,650
was shuffled and I'll never forget that 
he couldn't even walk.

2347
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:58,110
He was shuffling towards a scale for a 
second time.

2348
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,660
This was after he missed weight on the,
on the stage.

2349
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:03,870
They weighed him backstage afterwards.
He couldn't make the weight.

2350
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,980
He was off by like a couple pounds to 
it,

2351
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:11,010
so it was a mess.
There was no way he was going to lose 

2352
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:13,011
any more weight.
He was going to die and so they changed 

2353
01:31:13,011 --> 01:31:14,760
it to a non title fight,
but when if that guy had just earlier in

2354
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:17,790
his career,
had moved to a bigger camp and gone like

2355
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:22,791
the jacksons or american top team or 
something like that and really gotten 

2356
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:25,881
shape,
he would have been a motherfucker shit 

2357
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,300
who was so strong.
Obviously diet and cardio,

2358
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,960
you need a better training guys.
And it's cardio.

2359
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:32,340
Yeah,
it was like guy medgar was the best ever

2360
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:36,780
first round fighter in the world.
Guy was anyone the first finger dead,

2361
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,660
but after that it's a wrap.
He would get tired,

2362
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:40,500
you know?
Yeah.

2363
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:42,270
Well gosh guy metzger,
he's,

2364
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,250
he's another guy that had a real 
problem.

2365
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:49,340
He was taking vioxx.
He was taking some shit for his knees 

2366
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:50,980
and it was like an arthritis shit.
The turnout,

2367
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:56,110
it would give people strokes.
She had a fucking stroke from this 

2368
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:56,110
medication.
Did he?

2369
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:56,880
Yeah,
dude.

2370
01:31:56,881 --> 01:31:58,200
Yeah.
He never fought again.

2371
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,280
But he,
like his friends started noticing.

2372
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,620
He was like slurring his words like 
crazy and you know,

2373
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,290
it was like out of nowhere.
And so they,

2374
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:10,340
they urged them to go to a doctor and 
you went to a doctor and found out that 

2375
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:10,340
he had a stroke.
I'm pretty sure it was via.

2376
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:12,630
I'm going to pull this up because I 
don't want to speak at usc,

2377
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:17,700
but I remember they pulled that shit.
A guy medsker one of the.

2378
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,930
When they make it illegal,
but all these drugs.

2379
01:32:21,931 --> 01:32:23,250
Fuck everybody.
Oh yeah,

2380
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:24,630
no kidding man.
Yeah,

2381
01:32:24,631 --> 01:32:25,200
man.
He did?

2382
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:25,560
Yeah.
Okay.

2383
01:32:25,561 --> 01:32:26,910
that was,
it was vioxx.

2384
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:27,770
Yeah.
And he,

2385
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:31,800
he got a fucking stroke he took to uh,
they took him to the hospital.

2386
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,330
funky.
Crazy.

2387
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,090
Yeah.
I ain't know that.

2388
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:37,620
Yeah,
you gotta be careful.

2389
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:43,510
All of those medications that they can 
give you for things like arthritis and 

2390
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:46,430
extreme anti inflammatory medications 
like that,

2391
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:48,740
they can have extreme effect on your 
blood,

2392
01:32:48,741 --> 01:32:50,600
especially these like pharmaceutical 
ones.

2393
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:56,110
They pulled that shIt off the market.
I try to stay away from most all 

2394
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,530
medication.
You eat really healthy man.

2395
01:32:57,531 --> 01:32:59,750
I watched your,
your twitter feed for what you eat.

2396
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:02,000
You eat almost totally vegan.
Right?

2397
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:07,210
Well,
ever since I got out of jail I started 

2398
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:07,210
eating.
Um,

2399
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:08,030
I never,
not like 90 percent vegan.

2400
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:11,040
This what happens.
I read the China study and I already had

2401
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:16,041
a friend that was vegan and I started 
reading a lot and it just made sense to 

2402
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:16,430
me and I,
I believe this,

2403
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:21,510
the study,
like a lot of stats and stuff and that 

2404
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,430
documentary forks over knives and stuff.
So I gave it a shot.

2405
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,500
I'll try it out,
you know,

2406
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,340
and,
and I mean I'm still a strong,

2407
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,120
muscular whatever.

2408
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:29,450
What are you getting your protein from?
You say 90 percent vegan.

2409
01:33:29,451 --> 01:33:30,860
So it's 10 percent animal protein.

2410
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,140
Yeah,
basically what I do.

2411
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:36,780
So my protein and there's a lot of from 
I get a supplement,

2412
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:39,470
a lot of powder from.
I like sponsored garden of life.

2413
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:40,690
That's a great company.
Yeah,

2414
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,760
well I got good stuff.
I liked their in jail and I was taking 

2415
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:45,760
that stuff and I was like fuck,
it was expensive.

2416
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,480
I thought there are two main stream to 
sponsor me.

2417
01:33:47,481 --> 01:33:48,470
you're like I'm a maniac,
you know,

2418
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,250
x,
y,

2419
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:50,760
zed,
that's why I want.

2420
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:52,660
so I'm gonna email them and I was like 
hey,

2421
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:53,540
you know,
and they're like sure.

2422
01:33:53,541 --> 01:33:54,710
And I was like,
really?

2423
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:59,270
I'll say just let you know like a jail.
I did porn and be like,

2424
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:00,260
oh yeah,
we already googled you.

2425
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:01,780
And I was like all right,
cool.

2426
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:04,010
That's awesome.
But they're a great company.

2427
01:34:04,011 --> 01:34:09,011
But anyway,
I'm in the daytime mostly I make 

2428
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,630
smoothies just old like bananas,
spinach,

2429
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,130
strawberries and the protein.

2430
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,560
So do you avoid a big meal until like 
later?

2431
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:16,930
Are you doing that right now?
I'm doing this.

2432
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,740
I'll try and his warrior,
the warrior diet.

2433
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,570
I never read the book but I know the,
the,

2434
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:25,590
the,
I know a little bit about it but I like 

2435
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:25,590
it because here's what happens is that 
my whole life,

2436
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:26,330
you know,
uh,

2437
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:31,420
I did the regular body building diet,
eat every two or three hours and it was 

2438
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:33,530
always easy in the daytime and 
nighttime,

2439
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:36,500
I'm starving and I want to cheat.
It was always the problem,

2440
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:37,520
you know,
at nighttime was like,

2441
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:42,550
fuck man,
I want to eat this or that and you 

2442
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,550
can't,
you can't cheat.

2443
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,550
Right.
So then I read the warrior diet,

2444
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:44,330
the theory behind it and I said,
well it makes sense man.

2445
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:46,400
Like all day long,
I'm not hungry anyway.

2446
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:49,380
So I did a little bit during the day and
then I'll pig out at night.

2447
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:50,540
I have big,
big dinner.

2448
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:55,720
So the last,
just just the last few months I've been 

2449
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,860
doing this warrior diet thing,
but basically all I do is only eat this.

2450
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:59,720
I'll make a smoothie an hour before 
practice.

2451
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,630
And then I one right after practice.

2452
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:03,500
One hour,
huh?

2453
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:04,890
Yeah.
That's all you need is an hour.

2454
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:06,570
Yeah.
I feel like it's good for me.

2455
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,120
That's probably because it's a vegetable
base smoothie,

2456
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:09,720
right?
Yeah.

2457
01:35:09,721 --> 01:35:13,860
It's all fruit and I've tried to do that
with like whey protein.

2458
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,630
You start shitting your pants.
I wear it

2459
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,660
brains out,
you know,

2460
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:23,410
like way it comes from milk and it 
tastes better than whey protein taste 

2461
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:24,340
better and stuff.
But I don't know,

2462
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:26,750
I think,
I think it's bad from what I've read,

2463
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:29,180
I try to stay away from all dairy animal
stuff,

2464
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:32,060
especially dairy.
But then like what I usually do is like,

2465
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:35,690
I'll eat vegan all week and sunday.
You're like a fucking pig.

2466
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:37,400
I don't care.
You give a one cheat day,

2467
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:38,720
like pizza,
like anything.

2468
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:43,721
I don't care anything like nothing,
nothing forbidding but sometimes say 

2469
01:35:43,721 --> 01:35:46,010
like a flight to go to sushi,
I'll get sushi tonight.

2470
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,980
Big deal.
But in my house I only eat vegan.

2471
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,520
That's interesting.
So most of my protein comes from mostly 

2472
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:54,520
beans,
rice,

2473
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,440
a stash fields.
Um,

2474
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,700
and then,
uh,

2475
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,070
the protein.
But mostly I eat a boring diet.

2476
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:01,910
Did the same thing every day.
Same time today.

2477
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,760
That's smart because it freedom makes 
me.

2478
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:07,340
If I don't have a schedule,
I'm fucked.

2479
01:36:07,341 --> 01:36:09,260
I can't even if I have any freedom in my
schedule,

2480
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:11,540
I'll screw it all up.
So I had that written down.

2481
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:12,770
Eat this now.
Otherwise I'm screwed.

2482
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:15,590
Like same thing.
Like if I even get woke up early,

2483
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:17,600
I like,
my schedule is so exact.

2484
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,490
Like today,
like I'm here,

2485
01:36:19,491 --> 01:36:20,850
right?
Uh,

2486
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,720
if this ended early,
I wouldn't trade after this.

2487
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,730
My skin is ruined already.
And on the way here I had the,

2488
01:36:25,731 --> 01:36:27,760
I already ate junk food.
I fucking went the jak inhibitor.

2489
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:31,040
so you sort of manage yourself against 
your own impulses?

2490
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:33,760
Yeah,
because I know that like,

2491
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:35,020
I had this,
but I don't.

2492
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,950
If I have a schedule in front of me,
I'll follow it to a t.

2493
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:39,280
If I don't have one,
I'm,

2494
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:41,580
I can't trust myself.
You're too impulsive.

2495
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,100
Yeah,
yeah.

2496
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:42,870
Okay.
I can do it.

2497
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,670
But at least you understand that,
you know,

2498
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:46,610
if that's a trial and error thing,
you know,

2499
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,690
and I think that's probably,
you know,

2500
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,160
if you think about like your life and 
all the circumstances that you've had in

2501
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:56,850
your life,
those develop like paths they developed,

2502
01:36:56,851 --> 01:36:58,950
like behavior paths and those behavior 
paths.

2503
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:03,951
When you,
once you already go down that impulsive 

2504
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:03,951
road,
it becomes very difficult to break those

2505
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:08,121
paths.
That's why people are like gambling 

2506
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:08,121
junkies.
They'll fucking fall off the wagon.

2507
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:12,480
Just fucking let me just play one hand,
one hand a black chair and next thing 

2508
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,891
you know,
they're fucking sweating their collars 

2509
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:15,891
oN dawn.
Their fucking hair is crazy.

2510
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:15,891
I,
I've,

2511
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:16,920
I forbiD myself with a gamble.
Yeah.

2512
01:37:16,921 --> 01:37:17,930
I'm not a gambler either.

2513
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,040
Uh,
yeah.

2514
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:21,920
But this right now my diet,
I like to do,

2515
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:27,100
don't.
I don't think we need to eat them that 

2516
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:27,100
much.
Animals and stuff.

2517
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:30,680
You know,
the child studies shows like in the ras 

2518
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,690
and stuff that if the rats that ate a 
more than 10 percent animal products,

2519
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:39,910
the cancer that would turn on and then 
they'd take them to a 90 percent of 

2520
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:40,500
their diet and they would turn off the 
cancers.

2521
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:45,600
Well,
I'm here to tell you that I'm an 

2522
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,561
american and I'm not a fucking rat.
I'm a human being top of the food chain.

2523
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:50,050
I'll eat a rat if I'm hungry,
but I don't like to base my died of some

2524
01:37:50,051 --> 01:37:51,550
shitty road and said eat themselves.

2525
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:51,980
Yeah.
Well,

2526
01:37:51,981 --> 01:37:53,190
here's the thing too,
when you think about it.

2527
01:37:53,191 --> 01:37:54,710
All right,
so we're in tribes.

2528
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:57,180
Okay.
So those guys are the hunters.

2529
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:02,660
We're going to go out all day and hunt 
along the way when we're going to be 

2530
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:02,660
eating fucking apples and wherever we 
find.

2531
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,750
Right.
Whatever we could find.

2532
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:06,000
We gonna getting along the way.
The chicks are going to be at home,

2533
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,790
you know,
hunting or gathering and a clean shit up

2534
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,530
and w we,
we get a pig,

2535
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,140
we bring it home at nighttime and we 
have a feast,

2536
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:17,640
but it's one pig we caught maybe and 
there's a whole fucking village so we're

2537
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:20,070
all gonna get a small amount of meat and
mostly we're going to eat vegetables and

2538
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,960
plants and stuff,
but just to let you know,

2539
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:23,940
I mean I don't know how much you've done
online.

2540
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:28,970
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with eating a vegan diet and I'm a big 

2541
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,610
proponent in eating a lot of vegetables.
I eat a lot of vegetables.

2542
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:35,620
I think I feel better when I drink kale 
shakes and eat a lot of fresh 

2543
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,980
vegetables,
but the China study has been debunked by

2544
01:38:36,981 --> 01:38:39,120
many different scientists.
There's been a lot.

2545
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:39,500
Yeah,
yeah,

2546
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:40,220
yeah.
It has.

2547
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:45,590
There's been a lot of different work.
One of the things they accused the China

2548
01:38:45,741 --> 01:38:50,741
study,
I was cherry picking data in order to 

2549
01:38:50,741 --> 01:38:51,050
match their conclusions that they wanted
to make.

2550
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:54,610
Like there's this,
if you just google China study debunked.

2551
01:38:54,611 --> 01:38:56,700
There's a bunch of different articles 
about it like here,

2552
01:38:56,750 --> 01:39:01,750
here's one rest in peace China study,
and it's all about a guy who wrote a 

2553
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,280
story.
I started analyzing the,

2554
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:05,810
the original,
trying to study data.

2555
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,730
He said,
I had no intention of writing and actual

2556
01:39:07,731 --> 01:39:10,430
critique of a campbell's much lauded 
work.

2557
01:39:10,431 --> 01:39:13,490
I'm a data junkie numbers along with 
strawberries and audrey hepburn films,

2558
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:13,820
blah,
blah,

2559
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:14,120
blah,
blah,

2560
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:19,150
blah.
But after spending a solid month and a 

2561
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:19,150
half reading,
gRaphing,

2562
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:21,890
sticky noting and passing out at 3:00
AM from studious exhaustion upon my copy

2563
01:39:21,891 --> 01:39:24,980
of the raw China study data,
I've decided that it's tiMe to voice all

2564
01:39:24,981 --> 01:39:29,981
my criticisms and there are many and 
this guy just goes into all these 

2565
01:39:29,981 --> 01:39:32,090
different points where there's like the.
He said,

2566
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:37,091
campbell was influenced by his own 
expectations about animal protein and 

2567
01:39:37,091 --> 01:39:40,361
disease,
leading him to seek out specific 

2568
01:39:40,361 --> 01:39:41,480
correlations in the China study data and
elsewhere to confirm his prediction,

2569
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:43,520
which means that he didn't use real 
science.

2570
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:47,720
What he did was he used confirmation 
bias and he tried to go towards a lot of

2571
01:39:47,721 --> 01:39:48,650
vegans do that,
man.

2572
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:49,070
Like,
I tried,

2573
01:39:49,071 --> 01:39:50,390
I had this.
Uh,

2574
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:53,300
what's the,
the endurance runner that we had on

2575
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,250
the dude talking about?
Anyway,

2576
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:59,140
cat was a vegan,
really good guy.

2577
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,990
And we were,
we were talking about,

2578
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:03,540
uh,
about v rick roll.

2579
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:09,160
We were talking about ritual,
we're talking about veganism and you 

2580
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:09,190
know,
and he was saying that it had nothing to

2581
01:40:09,191 --> 01:40:12,250
do with not wanting to eat animals.
It just all about health.

2582
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:15,790
So I started talking to him about the 
benefits of fish oil and you know,

2583
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:18,520
and he was like agreeing that there's a 
lot of health benefits officials.

2584
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:19,970
I do supplement with fish oil.
Well,

2585
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:20,900
he's like,
no,

2586
01:40:20,901 --> 01:40:21,640
no I don't.
I'm like,

2587
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:26,641
well why wouldn't you,
if you know all the benefits official 

2588
01:40:26,641 --> 01:40:27,370
because it becomes a thing where you 
want to say you don't eat any animals.

2589
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:32,400
Here's the thing,
like my old buddies or my old roommate 

2590
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:32,500
was a vegan real deacon,
like reading labels and shit.

2591
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:36,850
I will never do that.
And I don't believe in the whole hundred

2592
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:37,990
percent vegan diet.
I believe that.

2593
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:43,290
I think I,
my opinion is we're meant to eat some 

2594
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:45,271
meat but mostly plants.
That's what I think we are probably 

2595
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:47,440
meant to eat naturally,
but uh,

2596
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:52,660
like I'll eat whatever I want to grow a 
great deal of benefit to eating animal 

2597
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:53,560
protein.
Now a lot,

2598
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,400
especially

2599
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,400
animal protein that's grass fed.
You start looking into a wild game and 

2600
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:04,381
grass Fed animal protein and the 
difference between like the essential 

2601
01:41:04,381 --> 01:41:04,390
fats,
there's like way more,

2602
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:09,100
uh,
that was like the salmon essential fatty

2603
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:11,590
acids are way more than the wild game,
much more,

2604
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:12,520
much more.
Well,

2605
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,650
you know,
the problem is most people,

2606
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:18,850
when you're judging diets,
here's one gigantic thumb.

2607
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,570
The sore thumb that sticks out.
Most people have sedentary lifestyles.

2608
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:25,330
So if you start judging the diet of the 
average american,

2609
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:27,790
what the fuck is the average american 
doing with their on their shit?

2610
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:32,820
Yeah.
So you can't even compare the average 

2611
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:33,190
american to an athlete.
But when you start talking to athletes,

2612
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:38,370
talk,
talking about the specific nutritional 

2613
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:40,681
demands of your red line and your 
fucking body every day when you're 

2614
01:41:40,681 --> 01:41:44,011
training,
when you're doing strength and 

2615
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:44,011
conditioning.
I've seen the videos you were,

2616
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:47,200
you're doing chin ups would fucking 
weight belts on and 90 pound dumbbells 

2617
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:51,511
on in between your legs,
your red line and your body all the 

2618
01:41:51,511 --> 01:41:53,740
time,
but you need as much protein,

2619
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:55,630
nutrients,
essential fatty acids,

2620
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:57,700
vitamins you need all the good shit.

2621
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:02,700
You can't afford to have a deficiency in
any area you should look into if you're 

2622
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,610
not opposed to it from a moral 
standpoint.

2623
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,340
Look into the benefits of grass fed 
proteins.

2624
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,150
That's why I like the way I'm doing.
I do both,

2625
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:13,320
but mostly the plants.
I think as long as I'm.

2626
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,690
My energy's high and my muscles staying 
the same strength,

2627
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,230
the saying like I could judge you by 
that kind of.

2628
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,860
I feel I feel good.
You know what I mean?

2629
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:23,200
It's definitely better than the average 
diet.

2630
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,220
Yeah,
and the thing is too,

2631
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,400
this is why in jail I stopped reading 
fucking fiction fiction is the real 

2632
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:29,400
shit,
right?

2633
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,600
Books.
Fiction is fake over the nonfiction.

2634
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,750
So now he's.
The reason why in jail I stopped reading

2635
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:39,751
nonfiction was because oh fucking read 
one book written by four phds and 

2636
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:45,100
they're telling me this right and not 
read another book by four phds and they 

2637
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:45,100
told me the opposite.

2638
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:49,590
No one knows shit and it pisses me off.
So the after awhile I started reading 

2639
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:49,720
only fixing just stories.
I don't give a shit,

2640
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:55,080
you know,
because I got sick and tired of reading 

2641
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,630
them,
contradict each other and no one knows 

2642
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:59,161
nothing.
We'll see what's going on is that 

2643
01:42:59,161 --> 01:43:00,460
there's not enough.
It's not that no one knows anything.

2644
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:05,490
It's just like people are still learning
and they're still learning about the 

2645
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:07,951
body.
I mean if you just look at training 

2646
01:43:07,951 --> 01:43:09,931
methods that people used to use just 100
years ago in comparison to training 

2647
01:43:09,931 --> 01:43:10,990
methods today,
you ever watched like those old training

2648
01:43:10,991 --> 01:43:15,991
camps like Jack Johnson and jack and 
jack dempsey and all these guys just 

2649
01:43:15,991 --> 01:43:18,760
doing all this crazy like old school 
training methods.

2650
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:24,300
It's silly.
Their bodies look different like 

2651
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:24,400
athletes or just different.
Today we understand tabata methods,

2652
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:26,620
we understand different protocols for 
endurance training.

2653
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,320
You understand heart rate monitors.
We understand overtraining,

2654
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:32,470
who understand like hydration,
electrolytes.

2655
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:34,060
There's just so much they understand 
today.

2656
01:43:34,061 --> 01:43:35,020
They did.
They didn't know.

2657
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:36,820
Then.
It's constantly growing.

2658
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:37,820
It's not.
It's not.

2659
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:43,620
I think the main problem is though is 
like if me and you are a scientist and 

2660
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:46,000
we figured out this thing like we think 
that we're right,

2661
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:48,700
but then we like the design since they 
fucking.

2662
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:52,020
They refuse to believe they're wrong and
they,

2663
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:57,030
they,
they'll push this even though now they 

2664
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,030
know it might be wrong with them.
They don't.

2665
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,800
They wasted so much time to fucking make
this right.

2666
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:02,860
Now they're scared it.
Same thing with the flat earth and 

2667
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:02,860
around with all that bullshit.
Same type of theory.

2668
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,140
You know what I mean?
We're like,

2669
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:05,780
you know,
they get committed to their idea.

2670
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:10,190
They didn't want to budge.
they would rather preach their idea even

2671
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:11,750
though it's not right.
Then let go,

2672
01:44:11,751 --> 01:44:13,820
and then that's the problem too with the
sign shit.

2673
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:18,850
Well,
that's an issue with people that study 

2674
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:22,451
ancient civilizations.
There's a guy that we've had on this 

2675
01:44:22,451 --> 01:44:24,911
podcast several times,
so a good friend of mine named graham 

2676
01:44:24,911 --> 01:44:27,431
hancock,
gregg guy who wrote this amazing book 

2677
01:44:27,431 --> 01:44:30,270
called fingerprints of the gods and it's
all about ancient structures and they.

2678
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:32,480
THey've taken geologists,
man,

2679
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:35,720
they had this guy,
robert schoch from boston university.

2680
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:40,990
They studied the erosion marks on the 
sphinx and they're trying to backdate 

2681
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:45,900
the.
The enclosure for the sphinx and trying 

2682
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:45,900
to say rain,
right?

2683
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:46,160
Yeah.
They say it's from thousands of years of

2684
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:51,161
rain.
Problem was the last time they had that 

2685
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:51,530
kind of rainfall in the river.
It's like 9,000

2686
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:53,930
bc,
so like we're talking about thousands of

2687
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:58,660
years before that because back then they
used to be a rain forest denial.

2688
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:00,200
We used to be like,
it's rich reinforce.

2689
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:04,010
So what he's saying is that just based 
on geological evidence,

2690
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,550
you're dealing with something that was 
constructed a long time ago,

2691
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:12,551
much longer than anybody thinks,
but these egyptologists did not want to 

2692
01:45:12,551 --> 01:45:15,260
believe they were digging their heels in
the sand and they were saying there's no

2693
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:16,160
way.
It's impossible.

2694
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,170
Whereas this,
they were laughing like,

2695
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:20,510
oh,
here's this culture from 12,000

2696
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:25,511
plus years ago you talk about,
and they didn't even know that anybody 

2697
01:45:25,511 --> 01:45:27,460
had built anything like that from 12,000
years ago until recently they found this

2698
01:45:27,461 --> 01:45:30,950
structure in Turkey called gold beckley 
tappy without a doubt.

2699
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:33,620
12,000
plus years old because someone 12,000

2700
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:38,621
years ago covered It because they've 
proven by doing carbon testing on the 

2701
01:45:38,621 --> 01:45:40,400
soil that it was all put at the same 
time.

2702
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:45,700
So they know the 12,000
years ago for sure someone was making 

2703
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:49,541
big crazy chinese shit,
but they don't want to talk about that 

2704
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:52,721
because they've been teaching college 
courses in university and forever and 

2705
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:55,250
they gave a timeline because this 
timeline has been established and that's

2706
01:45:55,251 --> 01:46:00,251
how they base their phds at today based 
on their studies and their words don't 

2707
01:46:00,251 --> 01:46:00,770
want to let it go.
And that's the problem.

2708
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:01,910
You know,
there's a problem,

2709
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:02,570
you know?
Uh,

2710
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:03,810
uh,
I don't know.

2711
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,020
It's a problem with ancient 
civilizations for sure,

2712
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:09,020
but it's a little bit of a problem with 
health and a lot of these fucking people

2713
01:46:09,021 --> 01:46:10,010
that are talking about,
oh,

2714
01:46:10,011 --> 01:46:11,620
you don't need vitamins,
you don't need this.

2715
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:16,900
Let me,
when we find out what you do with your 

2716
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,551
body,
because I have a feeling you're a fat 

2717
01:46:18,551 --> 01:46:20,471
fuck,
can you just sit around doing nothing 

2718
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:20,471
mean telling people they don't need 
vitamins,

2719
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:20,471
they don't need nutrients.
I just thought I should.

2720
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:25,250
That day on dr oz.
Dr was trying to tell them that you 

2721
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:25,250
don't need to take vitamins.
Bullshit.

2722
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:25,760
And then dr.
Oz was saying,

2723
01:46:25,761 --> 01:46:28,250
well you need to take your daily 
recommended allowance.

2724
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,470
Fucked the daily recommended allowance.
Guys don't know shit.

2725
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:31,790
I don't.
I don't believe none of that I take.

2726
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,570
I take.
You know what I mean?

2727
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:37,571
I don't,
I don't think it's going to hurt you to 

2728
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:37,571
mega doses of vitamins,
you know?

2729
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:41,170
Well,
it's also they love to make these these 

2730
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:43,990
headlines like,
I don't know if you saw this recent 

2731
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:44,570
story that where this research is st 
case closed vitamins don't work,

2732
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,090
but they based it on two things.

2733
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:49,550
I've talked about this before,
folks who listened and they like,

2734
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:54,580
you got to fucking talk about it again.
One more time is the last time I 

2735
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:54,580
promise.
Just for war machine,

2736
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,880
they based it on six people over 65 that
had had heart attacks,

2737
01:46:57,030 --> 01:47:01,110
that vitamins didn't keep them alive any
longer and people that were over 65 that

2738
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:06,111
had already had mental decline.
They were already experiencing 

2739
01:47:06,111 --> 01:47:06,200
alzheimer's.
It didn't slow their mental declines.

2740
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:08,340
The likable,
but that's not.

2741
01:47:08,341 --> 01:47:13,341
Vitamin doesn't work.
you're dealing with old people that are 

2742
01:47:13,341 --> 01:47:13,341
already there already.
A dead almost.

2743
01:47:13,341 --> 01:47:13,341
Yeah,
exactly.

2744
01:47:13,341 --> 01:47:17,421
Your heart attacks,
your brain stopped working and you 

2745
01:47:17,421 --> 01:47:17,421
having a heart attack.
Oh,

2746
01:47:17,421 --> 01:47:19,440
fucking centrum one didn't work.
It didn't fix that.

2747
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:21,510
That's crazy.
Unbelievable.

2748
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:24,690
But this is a.
This is a headline to get press,

2749
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,000
so they put these headlines out to get 
their study,

2750
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:29,190
to get people to read it and pay 
attention to it.

2751
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,890
It gets hits all these websites,
everybody gets excited about it,

2752
01:47:31,891 --> 01:47:35,640
they inflame the results because the 
more you inflaming more people are going

2753
01:47:35,641 --> 01:47:37,440
to share them on twitter and the next 
thing you know,

2754
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:39,480
people were arguing that you don't need 
vitamins.

2755
01:47:39,481 --> 01:47:41,970
There's just a study that released why 
even taking vitamins?

2756
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:47,120
These had study and there's no fucking 
studies that tell you don't need 

2757
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,120
vitamins.
This the stupidity.

2758
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,940
Yeah,
it was the same thing.

2759
01:47:47,941 --> 01:47:52,941
What's up with the soy milk?
I hear people say that it raises 

2760
01:47:52,941 --> 01:47:52,941
estrogen,
but people say it doesn't.

2761
01:47:52,941 --> 01:47:54,900
Is there a real study?
Is soy?

2762
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:59,930
Most definitely can have effects on your
hormone levels for men or just women or 

2763
01:47:59,930 --> 01:48:02,070
men or men in the study?
Cause I hear both and I don't.

2764
01:48:02,071 --> 01:48:07,071
I don't know which one.
I'm pretty sure soy can affect your 

2765
01:48:07,071 --> 01:48:07,071
hormone.
Well,

2766
01:48:07,071 --> 01:48:07,071
let's.
Let's just google it right now.

2767
01:48:07,071 --> 01:48:11,520
Can affect hormone levels,
hormone levels.

2768
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:14,240
There's a lot of shit.
They're gonna affect hormone levels.

2769
01:48:14,241 --> 01:48:16,360
You got to be careful about having added
nami.

2770
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:18,990
Nami,
he cries like a girl.

2771
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:23,991
He grows milk when he eats soybeans.
That our drinking water though is so 

2772
01:48:23,991 --> 01:48:26,940
full of a birth control pills when they 
like,

2773
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:31,970
when they cleaned it out,
the hormone staying in it's lauren 

2774
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:31,970
testosterone to.
Well,

2775
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:34,941
there is some.
There's also antidepressants that make 

2776
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:34,941
their way into our tricky water from 
people processing.

2777
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:38,250
Like when people flush them down the 
toilet was like when you drink water,

2778
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:41,370
like in some places you're drinking 
water that's been processed,

2779
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,300
they'll process sewage water back into 
the drinking and then somehow or another

2780
01:48:45,301 --> 01:48:50,301
micro doses of these antidepressants and
antibiotics and all kinds of shit can 

2781
01:48:51,181 --> 01:48:55,010
make it into that water,
but the levels are so low address,

2782
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,390
it'd be almost impossible to.

2783
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:00,840
It's impossible to feel.
I think it's just.

2784
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:04,680
It's just detectable.
Does soy.

2785
01:49:04,681 --> 01:49:08,010
Does eating soy increase estrogen?
Estrogen production?

2786
01:49:08,011 --> 01:49:10,190
Let's find out.
Yes it does.

2787
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:14,670
Soy beans are a complete protein source 
and a dietary staple of many cultures.

2788
01:49:14,671 --> 01:49:19,671
Store can.
Soy contains phytoestrogen is called 

2789
01:49:19,671 --> 01:49:21,750
isol.
Flay isoflavones owns that may mimic the

2790
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:23,670
activity of hormone estrogen in your 
body.

2791
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:28,140
The effects of soy isoflavones on human 
estrogen levels are complex,

2792
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:33,370
so it's safe for everyone to consume in 
moderation and can have a modest effect 

2793
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,830
on estrogen levels,
so that means it can have an effect,

2794
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:39,150
so don't get crazy and drink a lot of 
soy mIlk or dick would go soft,

2795
01:49:39,450 --> 01:49:41,970
grow some titties,
or if you're a girl,

2796
01:49:41,971 --> 01:49:43,650
you need some extra estrogen.
Men.

2797
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:45,830
Imagine if girls can eat like certain 
foods and their tips.

2798
01:49:45,831 --> 01:49:50,831
We grow bigger.
There be none of that shit at whole 

2799
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:50,831
foods.

2800
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:51,970
Try finding soybeans and hopefully it 
will be out.

2801
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,650
Yeah,
soy.

2802
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:57,790
So it's always an interesting one,
but it's not the best protein.

2803
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:59,740
Like keen was one of the best.
Yeah,

2804
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,880
that's real high in protein and all.
All of a sudden amino acids.

2805
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:06,700
Hampshire real good.
One to mcz digest to.

2806
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:11,790
Yeah,
the one that I think that the garden of 

2807
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:11,790
life one and it's like a blend I think.
Yeah,

2808
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:14,230
but you can get a lot of protein.
Maybe mac danzig pulls it off.

2809
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:16,690
You can do a lot of protein in a vegan 
diet.

2810
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:18,040
You just gotta know what the fuck you're
doing.

2811
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:21,940
The real issue is healthy fats too.
You got to eat avocados and shit.

2812
01:50:21,941 --> 01:50:26,941
You got to get a lot of fats or just 
like a flax oil shake because I'm the 

2813
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:29,620
boss.
I'm not against.

2814
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:32,170
I would take the fish oils.
I don't bother me.

2815
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,000
Like mac wouldn't know.
He's a real,

2816
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:35,350
real hardcore vegan.
Yeah,

2817
01:50:35,351 --> 01:50:36,990
he's an anImal.
He told me like,

2818
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,680
fuck that.
That's bullshit.

2819
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,590
Like you don't like.
And I,

2820
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:41,740
I figured that he's been a deacon salon.
maybe he knows.

2821
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,590
So I believed them.
He,

2822
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,570
what did he say?
It was bullshit.

2823
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:45,160
The soy shit.
Like that's bullshit.

2824
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:47,700
There's no study that getting emotional.
That's the woman in them.

2825
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:50,020
And the estrogen is making them 
emotional.

2826
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,590
Tell him to back off the beans back.
Yeah.

2827
01:50:52,591 --> 01:50:53,330
Well mac is,
uh,

2828
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,280
he's,
he's,

2829
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:57,290
he's an interesting dude because his,
uh,

2830
01:50:57,310 --> 01:51:00,070
he's got a real strong character.
I really liked that guy.

2831
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:03,700
He's a very smart dude and he's a strong
believer.

2832
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,890
Excuse me,
in character.

2833
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,300
That's why he chooses not to have a,
of any animal protein.

2834
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:12,400
He started for some reason I started 
was,

2835
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:15,310
was from like a sinus infections.
Strep throat.

2836
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:17,800
Really?
Dairy man,

2837
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,920
a lot of people have issues,
ice strep throat and sinus infections 

2838
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,980
like three times a year,
every fucking year since,

2839
01:51:23,981 --> 01:51:24,670
after,
since forever.

2840
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:25,780
Right.
And then,

2841
01:51:25,781 --> 01:51:30,781
um,
I heard a rumor that if you stop 

2842
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:30,781
drinking milk,
it can go away.

2843
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:30,781
I was like,
bullshit.

2844
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:32,200
I tried it and it stopped.
Fucking I don't get it anymore.

2845
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:37,340
Yeah.
Friend tony hinchcliffe for the same 

2846
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:37,340
issue.
Right.

2847
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:37,540
He stopped drinking milk,
need cleared up a lot and my dad told me

2848
01:51:37,541 --> 01:51:38,470
this.
That's why he started to.

2849
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:43,530
And then he,
after that he started researching more 

2850
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:43,530
and that's why he became a vegan and 
plus the animal stuff.

2851
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,440
But yeah,
you're not supposed to drink milk that's

2852
01:51:44,441 --> 01:51:49,441
been homogenized and pasteurized.
And the problem with drinking raw milk 

2853
01:51:49,441 --> 01:51:49,630
is,
unless you know who's milking that cow,

2854
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:54,990
that cow,
you don't know what the fuck you're 

2855
01:51:54,990 --> 01:51:56,520
getting,
how they're dealing and handling the 

2856
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:56,520
milk right afterwards.

2857
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:59,250
If you can get a good source though,
if you get a real good farm that's 

2858
01:51:59,250 --> 01:51:59,460
reputable,
that knows how to deal with their,

2859
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,130
their,
their,

2860
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:02,080
um,
the raw milk some.

2861
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:07,120
There was a recent study also,
they try to discredit wall milk saying 

2862
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:07,630
one out of six people who drink raw milk
and get sick,

2863
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:12,990
but then in the article itself it shows 
that you can't prove that what happened 

2864
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:17,761
to them came from the raw milk and it 
could have been from the only had raw 

2865
01:52:17,761 --> 01:52:21,511
milk.
They weren't controlling the rest of 

2866
01:52:21,511 --> 01:52:21,511
their.
Their input and their input varied.

2867
01:52:21,511 --> 01:52:23,560
Everybody's input varied and people get 
sick all the time.

2868
01:52:23,561 --> 01:52:28,561
So it's real sketchy.
It's not like a double blind placebo 

2869
01:52:28,561 --> 01:52:31,210
test taken raw milk because of rose to 
homogenized or pasteurized milk and then

2870
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:34,120
they both eat the same diet and it's 
controlled st portions.

2871
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:34,960
Living lab.

2872
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:35,750
Yeah.
You,

2873
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,330
you have to live in the same info.
You know,

2874
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:37,960
it's,
it's hard,

2875
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:43,950
but you've got to be careful.
You got to be careful whenever 

2876
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:46,681
anything's wrong.
You know you've got gotta have really 

2877
01:52:46,681 --> 01:52:46,681
fresh stuff,
but that's what we're supposed to eat.

2878
01:52:46,681 --> 01:52:46,880
We're not speed,
speed,

2879
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:49,660
old rotten.
So those refrigerators and all,

2880
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:50,390
you know what I mean,
like.

2881
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:53,420
Yeah,
but you know,

2882
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:58,900
for,
for most people they're not going to be 

2883
01:52:58,900 --> 01:52:58,900
able to afford to just buy milk every 
day.

2884
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:03,660
I mean that's really what we're not 
supposed to live in societies where 

2885
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:04,250
you've keep up a steak for a month,
you know,

2886
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:09,290
it takes not supposed to sit in your 
refrigerator and the only way meet can 

2887
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:12,611
sit in your refrigerator.
It has to be like some fucking bologna 

2888
01:53:12,611 --> 01:53:12,860
thing that's barely a meat,
you know?

2889
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,310
It's just been filled with all kinds of 
shit to the point where it can't.

2890
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:17,990
Right.
She's hot dogs,

2891
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,280
cheese,
hot dogs.

2892
01:53:19,281 --> 01:53:24,281
That's the worst.
What are those like meet with fake 

2893
01:53:24,281 --> 01:53:26,290
cheese in it.
Oh god,

2894
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,680
yeah.
That's terrible for you.

2895
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:30,260
All that stuff just makes you feel 
awful.

2896
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:31,510
Just makes you,
your,

2897
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:34,790
your body just goes into shutdown mode.
Even on my cheat day,

2898
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:36,870
like I do,
just because a,

2899
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:38,990
I'm a pig,
I want to have my pig day.

2900
01:53:39,330 --> 01:53:41,390
I always feel like shit.
Do you eat gluten?

2901
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,400
Yeah.
See,

2902
01:53:43,401 --> 01:53:45,800
I don't know nothing about gluten.
I'd never really read up on it.

2903
01:53:45,801 --> 01:53:50,630
So like the real science behind my 
cousin is a lawyer in Washington.

2904
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:55,310
She has a bag gluten allergy where 
she'll like be in bedridden for gluten.

2905
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,390
She was telling me blah,
blah,

2906
01:53:56,391 --> 01:53:57,080
blah.
I mean,

2907
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:58,840
I don't really know nothing about 
gluten.

2908
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,760
I have no gluten allergy.
I've eaten pasta all my life.

2909
01:54:01,761 --> 01:54:04,010
I'm italian.
I grew up eating bread and pasta,

2910
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:06,500
but when I cut it out,
I noticed a big difference.

2911
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,660
My face got skinnier,
first of all,

2912
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:13,661
I felt like less,
less soreness in the areas that I 

2913
01:54:13,661 --> 01:54:14,510
usually get inflammation.
Like my back.

2914
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:16,480
I went to it because of,
um,

2915
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:21,540
a therapist told me that she told me 
they have good results with helping 

2916
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:22,250
people out back injuries by getting off 
of gluten,

2917
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,320
getting off gluten and sugar.
She's like,

2918
01:54:24,321 --> 01:54:26,260
anything bad for sure.
Terrible for you.

2919
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:27,440
She's like,
these things,

2920
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,180
they're not just bad for you.
She's like,

2921
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:30,920
they're inflammatory.
And she goes,

2922
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:32,960
and that's what the issue is.
The issue is inflammation.

2923
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:35,480
And if you have foods that cause 
inflammation,

2924
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:37,640
it makes injuries more difficult to 
heal.

2925
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:37,940
Yeah,
iT was.

2926
01:54:37,941 --> 01:54:41,660
I was reading about all that shit,
like sugar and stuff.

2927
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:46,520
It taxes your kidneys and your liver and
that they can't do their jobs right?

2928
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:51,610
So your body has more toxins and this 
should have and it makes your body 

2929
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:51,610
inflamed and blah,
blah,

2930
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:51,610
blah.

2931
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:52,250
Sugar's not good for it.
Too bad.

2932
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:54,730
It's fucking delicious though.
God dammit.

2933
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,820
Everything good for you is fucking 
boring and bland.

2934
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,940
everything delicious.
It's fucking terrible for you.

2935
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,380
It's true.
That's where we are,

2936
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:06,410
where we are as a person.
We haven't to figure out how to make.

2937
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:11,650
They've got a genetically engineered 
food to just be unbelievably delicious 

2938
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:13,750
but nutritious it.
What's that gmo?

2939
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:16,160
That's the devil.
It's the devil or what?

2940
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:18,080
Well,
here's what's up with gmos.

2941
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:20,040
Some of it is good and some of it is 
bad.

2942
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:21,290
Just like everYthing else.
I mean,

2943
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:23,450
there's things like golden rice,
they figured,

2944
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:28,480
figured out a way to engineer proteins 
to rice and make a rice that's more easy

2945
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:30,640
to,
to,

2946
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:35,760
to process.
And a lot of people have benefited from 

2947
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,461
it greatlY.
And then there's also shit that they 

2948
01:55:39,461 --> 01:55:39,461
designed that they want to make so that,
uh,

2949
01:55:39,461 --> 01:55:40,010
uh,
a plant,

2950
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:42,110
certain plants can deal with pesticides.

2951
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,000
There's that too.
But there's a,

2952
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,010
but they've always done that with 
selective breeding,

2953
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:47,880
but they've,
they've,

2954
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:53,240
they've messed with things so that they 
deal wIth pesticides better and 

2955
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:56,250
unfortunately like a lot of times that 
fucks up the environment like bs,

2956
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,070
like they've,
they've connected the drop of dropoff in

2957
01:55:59,071 --> 01:56:00,780
the population of bees to a couple of 
different things.

2958
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,360
They say that cell phones are not good 
for them.

2959
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:08,510
They're not digging the fact that 
there's all these cell phone signals 

2960
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:08,510
everywhere that fucks with bees 
apparently.

2961
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:12,950
But they can deal with that I guess.
but what's fucking them up is there's 

2962
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:15,921
certain pesticides that just wreck havoc
on b communities and if you get a 

2963
01:56:16,171 --> 01:56:21,171
genetically modified plant and in these 
chemicals are involved in that process 

2964
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:25,120
and these bees get ahold of these 
chemicals or they come into contact with

2965
01:56:25,121 --> 01:56:27,150
these chemicals,
it can be deadly to them.

2966
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,430
There's,
you know,

2967
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,360
this is a real issue with fucking,
with nature,

2968
01:56:31,361 --> 01:56:36,361
with we don't know the ultimate 
consequences because the world that we 

2969
01:56:36,361 --> 01:56:38,280
live in is an ecosystem.
It's like everything affects everything.

2970
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:43,460
They say that if aunts died,
if we killed all the aunts and the 

2971
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:43,460
planet,
we will be fucked.

2972
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:44,880
Like the whole world would go into 
chaos.

2973
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:46,680
It.
Who knows these two?

2974
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,210
yeah,
it was.

2975
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:49,140
We need everything.
It's all here for a reason.

2976
01:56:49,141 --> 01:56:54,141
You know,
it's all connected and when you have 

2977
01:56:54,141 --> 01:56:55,881
something that you know,
well it can absorb chemicals better so 

2978
01:56:55,881 --> 01:56:59,721
we can kill off all these bugs and we 
don't have to worry about and we get a 

2979
01:56:59,721 --> 01:57:02,630
big yield and we can sell that yield,
but it's killing bees like that's.

2980
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:07,640
There's a yin and a yang to everything.
There's a push and a pull to everything 

2981
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,521
and the more you you dabble with nature,
you're dealing with this unbelievably 

2982
01:57:10,521 --> 01:57:11,310
complex structure.

2983
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:14,250
The structure of nature so intertwined 
and so,

2984
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:17,370
so broad that when you fuck around with 
it,

2985
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:20,640
hopefully it has a good effect,
but there's also,

2986
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:23,820
there's going to be the potential for 
negative downsides.

2987
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:26,830
That's what I think about gmo.
I think it's.

2988
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:32,120
Look,
if we could figure out a way to make 

2989
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:33,270
food that all these poor people would 
have nutritious food,

2990
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:36,120
it's super easy to grow and everybody 
benefits from it.

2991
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:37,590
Hey,
I'm all for it,

2992
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:42,890
but most of the time when they're 
involved in genetically modified foods 

2993
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:43,050
are doing it for profit.
They do other things for money.

2994
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:46,200
It's a big part of what it is.
Fucked up.

2995
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:47,640
Yeah.
Because I was like,

2996
01:57:47,641 --> 01:57:51,430
we think about money now this now with 
dealing carrier.

2997
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:53,370
What's gonna happen next?
You know what I mean?

2998
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:59,150
Well,
there's a lot of people that definitely 

2999
01:57:59,150 --> 01:57:59,280
don't think about the future.
They just fucking ride that bitch.

3000
01:57:59,280 --> 01:57:59,960
Right?
It's like,

3001
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:03,030
why the fuck do we do still use oil?
It a bunch of reasons.

3002
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:06,330
One because we know how to do it and 
we'd have the whole systems in place for

3003
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:09,600
oil to change the system and change it 
to like solar.

3004
01:58:09,601 --> 01:58:14,601
Like everybody,
like la could probably run on solar if 

3005
01:58:14,601 --> 01:58:17,271
we have.
So it's really a shame that we don't 

3006
01:58:17,271 --> 01:58:20,211
have solar panels everywhere in la.
The motherfucker is constantly and they 

3007
01:58:20,211 --> 01:58:23,670
work and it's sunny constantly mean.
It would be definitely more expensive.

3008
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:28,671
It would take awhile to then you also 
have to get batteries and the batteries 

3009
01:58:28,671 --> 01:58:28,700
have to have minerals and those 
batteries.

3010
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:33,710
A lot of those minerals come from 
conflict areas like the Congo or 

3011
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,320
Afghanistan,
so it's not all simple,

3012
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:37,840
sweet and clean to have electric power 
from,

3013
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:40,800
from solar because you have to have 
batteries to store that power.

3014
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,180
Otherwise it goes off at night.
You know what about,

3015
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:45,100
what about that nikola tesla?
Dude,

3016
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:47,080
we Buy them.
Yeah,

3017
01:58:47,081 --> 01:58:47,730
sure.
Yeah.

3018
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:48,580
She got fucked.
You know,

3019
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:50,170
we never learned about him,
but he meant that all the,

3020
01:58:50,171 --> 01:58:53,110
all the best electrIc electric stuff,
he invented a lot of cool shit,

3021
01:58:53,111 --> 01:58:56,440
but he also fell in love with a pigeon.
He was in love with the pigeon before he

3022
01:58:56,441 --> 01:58:58,520
died and here's,
I likes to fly pigeon.

3023
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,520
I don't think he fucked hIm.
I don't think he fucked anything.

3024
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,560
He actually,
one of the quotes,

3025
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:05,380
I can't find this anywhere else,
but I read it once.

3026
01:59:05,381 --> 01:59:10,381
I know for sure that he destroyed his 
sexuality was the quotes because yeah,

3027
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:14,530
you had some issue with some woman and 
it didn't work out and it just destroyed

3028
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:15,670
him.
He couldn't concentrate,

3029
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,810
so he's like,
you know what,

3030
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,040
I'm done with these balls and just 
she's,

3031
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,000
hey did.
There's a guy in my gym,

3032
01:59:23,001 --> 01:59:24,080
he's a,
he's from New York.

3033
01:59:24,081 --> 01:59:25,280
Actually we a scientist,
right?

3034
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:27,930
It looks like a normal guy,
but he's a scientist and he,

3035
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,570
he,
he invented this thing,

3036
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:35,040
do I?
Now this company is in the works for 

3037
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:35,040
that.
It's like a $20,000,000

3038
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:35,040
deal.
Huge thing,

3039
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:35,040
right?
It's a,

3040
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,690
it's a magnet assisted generator.
So,

3041
01:59:39,570 --> 01:59:41,810
so once it gets going,
it's perpetual,

3042
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,120
not perpetual,
But 10,000

3043
01:59:44,121 --> 01:59:47,680
years is how long a magnet last until 
the energy to magnet dies.

3044
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:49,370
So it'll,
it'll spend 10,000

3045
01:59:49,371 --> 01:59:50,600
years.
Jesus christ.

3046
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,850
It's like a fucking huge fucking deal.
It's like,

3047
01:59:53,130 --> 01:59:53,940
you know,
twitter is three,

3048
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:56,150
a million or a huge deal and it's.
He says it'll,

3049
01:59:56,151 --> 01:59:56,840
it'll,
it'll,

3050
01:59:56,900 --> 02:00:01,900
it'll boost any power plant anywhere 
from 70 to 100 percent more power 

3051
02:00:02,151 --> 02:00:07,151
production,
but it's like a pretty much like the 

3052
02:00:07,151 --> 02:00:08,270
modern tesla coil.
Like it's like the newest thing.

3053
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:14,080
I actually told him I,
I want to see if we can call them or 

3054
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,001
somewhere.
He said he would come down and talk to 

3055
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:16,001
you,
but it's a,

3056
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:16,001
it's a,
it's a bad ass.

3057
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:17,210
Yeah.
Give me his email address and I'll email

3058
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:18,060
them.
We'll figure it out,

3059
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:23,960
find out what it is.
He told him about it at the gym that 

3060
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:23,960
are.

3061
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:24,070
But it's like it's gonna be a real deal 
man.

3062
02:00:24,071 --> 02:00:26,440
And he says something like that.
There's no.

3063
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:28,690
Because right now we use turbans.
No,

3064
02:00:28,691 --> 02:00:31,110
the windmill was created electricity.
The turbines on the waterfall.

3065
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:36,220
Let's tricity the nuclear energy,
but this thing is just fucking magnets 

3066
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:36,610
and they spend by themselves and that's 
it and it makes electricity

3067
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:38,410
so it just needs something to start it 
up.

3068
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:42,820
And then once it starts up they repel 
each other and I just keep on moving,

3069
02:00:42,821 --> 02:00:43,810
you know,
If it's that easy,

3070
02:00:43,811 --> 02:00:48,811
why hasn't someone else figure that out?
Petro emotion and supposedly not 

3071
02:00:48,811 --> 02:00:50,800
supposed to ever been solved.
It's not perpetual motion.

3072
02:00:50,801 --> 02:00:53,650
If you get something to start it up,
if something starts it up,

3073
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:57,790
you know you're gonna need something.
It only last 10,000

3074
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:59,080
years,
which is fucking long enough,

3075
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:01,450
but you got to get it going.
But then once it goes,

3076
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,020
it just keeps.
Keeps on moving.

3077
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:03,340
Boom,
boom,

3078
02:01:03,341 --> 02:01:04,720
boom.
That's crazy.

3079
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:09,400
So this dude is easy figuring out a way 
to sell this.

3080
02:01:09,401 --> 02:01:11,440
What would they think?
They're in negotiations with?

3081
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:13,690
Huge,
huge companies.

3082
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:16,090
Be better Fucking be careful.
I was that dude.

3083
02:01:16,091 --> 02:01:18,040
I'd hide where I live.
They'll fucking kill him.

3084
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:19,920
Like they shit.
That dude who invented the water card?

3085
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:22,810
The guy who rented the car power.
That was powered by water.

3086
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:27,811
Yeah.
He died in a meeting he had with these 

3087
02:01:27,811 --> 02:01:27,850
people.
Sid Caesar.

3088
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:32,990
Since caesar.
Just If the guy who invented the water 

3089
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:35,241
car died in a meeting with these two 
people that were supposed to be 

3090
02:01:35,241 --> 02:01:36,640
government agents and he was screaming,
they poisoned me,

3091
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:38,860
poisoned me.
That was his last words for you.

3092
02:01:38,861 --> 02:01:40,100
Had a attack fucked up,
dude.

3093
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:43,980
That might be a fake room or by the way 
sounds fake.

3094
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,660
It sounds fake.
It sounds like that other one there.

3095
02:01:45,661 --> 02:01:47,510
There you olympics.
Won the olympics.

3096
02:01:47,511 --> 02:01:49,930
One was totally fake.
They like to do that lately.

3097
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:54,970
Like to have these websites and just 
write fake stories and then not even 

3098
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:54,970
funny.
They just fake.

3099
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:54,970
Yeah.
There's a website where people,

3100
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:59,690
you could just add somebody's name to 
the last part of it and it will be a 

3101
02:01:59,690 --> 02:01:59,690
fake,
a hoax death.

3102
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:02,470
Like it looks like a news site and it 
just replaces photos.

3103
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:05,180
There's too much on the internet.
The internet,

3104
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:08,750
too much freedom on the government.
When I was at the citadel at the college

3105
02:02:08,751 --> 02:02:13,730
I was at because I was a biology major,
so they had some scientists were touring

3106
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:16,940
the country and they were like coming 
around to schools and uh,

3107
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:18,790
trying to like tell us stuff,
you know,

3108
02:02:18,791 --> 02:02:20,060
what will make us aware.

3109
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:25,150
It was like a team of four scientists 
and it was just them and their 

3110
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:28,250
adventures.
They're saying these are our inventions 

3111
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:28,250
that the government is fucking canned.
We're only four guys,

3112
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:33,011
you know,
imagine how many other things are out 

3113
02:02:33,011 --> 02:02:33,011
there,
but one guy,

3114
02:02:33,011 --> 02:02:35,500
he said,
he invented a carburetor that you can 

3115
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:35,570
hook on any car and you're,
I think it's 80 miles a gallon.

3116
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,460
Like instantly.
He's like,

3117
02:02:37,461 --> 02:02:38,330
oh fuck,
I'm fucking.

3118
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:40,470
He was saying,
well we went for like jam or what?

3119
02:02:40,471 --> 02:02:45,471
He couldn't saY.
It was like he thought I saved all this 

3120
02:02:45,471 --> 02:02:45,471
money.
I'm going to be rich,

3121
02:02:45,471 --> 02:02:45,471
blah,
blah,

3122
02:02:45,471 --> 02:02:45,471
blah.
He says,

3123
02:02:45,471 --> 02:02:46,430
the fuckIng government got the patent 
candidate,

3124
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:48,350
right?
There's this lady,

3125
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:52,130
she made a clear enamel coat.
He put her teeth one time,

3126
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:54,830
the dentist puts it on the clear coat,
and keith are invincible.

3127
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,360
They'll never get a caBbie.
Nothing.

3128
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:57,510
They're like,
it's like a seal.

3129
02:02:57,511 --> 02:03:02,511
It seals your teeth.
They bought the patent through the way 

3130
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:02,511
away.
Really know the guy invented.

3131
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:05,060
So you know,
cigarettes are addicting,

3132
02:03:05,290 --> 02:03:06,710
you know,
but it causes fucking cancer.

3133
02:03:06,711 --> 02:03:11,690
One dies.
He invented a molecule that It addicts.

3134
02:03:11,691 --> 02:03:15,500
You like nicotine still,
but you just have no cancer.

3135
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:19,460
So the cigarette,
you smoke and you're hooked on it,

3136
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,110
but you won't die.
He's like,

3137
02:03:21,111 --> 02:03:22,130
oh,
this is the best invention ever.

3138
02:03:22,131 --> 02:03:27,131
I'm gonna save all these lives.
And the company that he worked for 

3139
02:03:27,131 --> 02:03:27,950
bought it and shoved it.
That doesn't sound right.

3140
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:31,370
How is it possible that you could smoke 
and not get sick?

3141
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,100
Because the,
the,

3142
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:33,120
the,
the,

3143
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,540
the molecule event that was just like 
nicotine or whatever it was.

3144
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:37,280
It was addictive,
but it was a car.

3145
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:39,530
It wouldn't kill you.
I believe he said that to you,

3146
02:03:39,531 --> 02:03:40,970
but I also believe he's full of shit.

3147
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:46,030
I dunno.
Some pretty complicated medicine right 

3148
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:48,971
there.
They people would know about the 

3149
02:03:48,971 --> 02:03:48,971
possibility of that.
These guys were,

3150
02:03:48,971 --> 02:03:52,920
there were a team of scientists and 
they're coming around like telling us 

3151
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,700
like we're four guys and like we've 
invented this shit.

3152
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,220
It's hard when you're dealing with 
something that's so long ago too.

3153
02:03:58,221 --> 02:03:58,940
And then like,
you know,

3154
02:03:58,941 --> 02:04:01,970
you try to like recant the story,
tell the story,

3155
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:03,650
but that was adjusted.
But you know what I mean.

3156
02:04:03,651 --> 02:04:05,150
But,
but it's like wait a while.

3157
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,240
If you had an enamel coat in her teeth,
you cannot get a cavity then most 

3158
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:10,240
answers out of work,
you know,

3159
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:14,790
you know they that the car didn't.
She doesn't want 80 mile per gallon 

3160
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:14,790
cars.
You know what I mean?

3161
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:14,990
They don't want that.
Yeah,

3162
02:04:14,991 --> 02:04:15,450
yeah.
You know,

3163
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:17,650
back then you hook It on your car and 
you're,

3164
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,480
you're set.
Well,

3165
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:20,630
the definitely would be a blow back.
There was,

3166
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:22,640
it was definitely a lot of people.
If they're losing money,

3167
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:27,641
if they would lose money,
if something came along that made cars 

3168
02:04:27,641 --> 02:04:28,100
unbelievably more efficient,
they would need less gasoline.

3169
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:33,280
That would be a fuckload less money.
The amount of money that's spent every 

3170
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:36,850
day In this country on fossil fuels.
We can't even wrap our head around that 

3171
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:36,850
number.
Crazy.

3172
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:38,130
It's an insane number.
So to get

3173
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,650
that out,
it's going to take many generations.

3174
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:46,310
It's going to take a long window of 
change or it's going to take one 

3175
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:47,190
spectacular invention.
Like the electric car.

3176
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,800
Electric cars are cool,
but fuck,

3177
02:04:49,801 --> 02:04:53,340
they take a long time to charge up.
They could only go like 300 miles.

3178
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:56,760
It takes like you gotta charge them,
like even if you need rapid charge,

3179
02:04:56,761 --> 02:05:01,761
it's a half hour,
so you have to sit in a gas station for 

3180
02:05:01,761 --> 02:05:01,761
half hour.
Your fucking car charges.

3181
02:05:01,761 --> 02:05:02,840
Talked to doing it for my gym.
That guy,

3182
02:05:02,841 --> 02:05:04,650
the scientist guy about the cars.
I was like,

3183
02:05:04,651 --> 02:05:07,380
yeah man.
Like he says it's a scam though.

3184
02:05:07,381 --> 02:05:12,381
He says that the whole car was pretty 
much a battery and he says that all the 

3185
02:05:12,381 --> 02:05:15,660
lead in the shit and the battery is,
it actually ends up being just as bad or

3186
02:05:15,661 --> 02:05:20,661
worse for the environment than,
than if you just would have had a car 

3187
02:05:20,661 --> 02:05:20,661
with gas.

3188
02:05:20,661 --> 02:05:20,661
Really.
That's what he says.

3189
02:05:20,661 --> 02:05:20,661
But I was like,
fuck.

3190
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,710
I thought that was all propaganda dude.
But he says,

3191
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:24,450
no,
it's fucking,

3192
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:26,090
it's not as good as you think it is 
going.

3193
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:27,930
Well.
You definitely need minerals.

3194
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:32,960
Knew the same thing is with the um,
with the batteries that you need for 

3195
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,021
solar generators.
You need minerals to put into the mean 

3196
02:05:36,021 --> 02:05:37,770
at least in the current technology that 
they had used lithium ion.

3197
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,210
And that's one of the big discoveries 
they found.

3198
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:44,211
Afghanistan was lithium.
Lithium is pretty valuable stuff and 

3199
02:05:44,211 --> 02:05:48,201
then when they converted it into 
batteries like you to get that out of 

3200
02:05:48,201 --> 02:05:51,291
the ground,
you got to get it out of the ground and 

3201
02:05:51,291 --> 02:05:51,291
that's so anybody thinks that you got 
this completely green,

3202
02:05:51,291 --> 02:05:56,151
clean thing because it's made out of 
batteries now it's just not using as 

3203
02:05:56,151 --> 02:05:57,780
much fossil fuel every day.
That's what he was saying.

3204
02:05:57,780 --> 02:06:02,780
He said that when you add it up,
but it really isn't all you think is 

3205
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:03,840
going to be.
It takes fossil fuel to make a car too.

3206
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:08,870
That's another thing that people aren't 
taken into consideration and there's no 

3207
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:09,720
tires other than rubber tires.
I mean,

3208
02:06:09,721 --> 02:06:14,721
you get,
you gotta use synthetic materials to 

3209
02:06:14,721 --> 02:06:16,671
make tires.
They haven't come up with a hemp tire 

3210
02:06:16,671 --> 02:06:16,671
yet.
You know,

3211
02:06:16,671 --> 02:06:19,971
until they come up with something that's
absolutely green and biodegradable as a 

3212
02:06:19,971 --> 02:06:23,061
tire,
you're always going to deal with you 

3213
02:06:23,061 --> 02:06:23,061
ever see a tire when it gets lit on fire
forever.

3214
02:06:23,061 --> 02:06:23,910
Disgusting.
I mean,

3215
02:06:23,911 --> 02:06:28,911
that is toxic waste.
That's one of the things they do to 

3216
02:06:28,911 --> 02:06:28,911
people in Brazil.
There was a thing,

3217
02:06:28,911 --> 02:06:29,440
um,
they,

3218
02:06:29,441 --> 02:06:34,441
they do what they call microwave you,
they put you inside a row of tires 

3219
02:06:34,441 --> 02:06:36,780
burning and burn you.
It's because your dna,

3220
02:06:36,781 --> 02:06:41,781
it becomes almost impossible to identify
you because you Just get intermingled 

3221
02:06:41,941 --> 02:06:42,990
with these tires.

3222
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:45,680
It's just a mess.
Yeah.

3223
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:51,020
Gasoline and tires.
It's like a fucked up way to get rid of 

3224
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:51,020
a body.
Oh,

3225
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:55,160
that,
that's what people go destroy vehicles 

3226
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:57,510
that they want insurance to be destroyed
because the tire's melts so hot.

3227
02:06:57,511 --> 02:06:59,520
That will actually bend the whole frame 
of the car.

3228
02:06:59,521 --> 02:07:03,750
So that way you can do to get your car.
So people are so silly.

3229
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:06,540
Yeah.
So tell me,

3230
02:07:06,541 --> 02:07:07,300
mAn,
we were,

3231
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:09,900
we were talking about this,
but we got off the subject.

3232
02:07:09,901 --> 02:07:12,570
What did you do the entire year that you
were in solitary?

3233
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:17,430
Like what was your day?
Did you wake up [inaudible]?

3234
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:19,560
Because it was weird.
They were fetus like at um,

3235
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,540
for him was breakfast,
right?

3236
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,040
So they wake you up,
feed you breakfast,

3237
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,110
eating past black guy,
right.

3238
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:26,940
And then you get up again like nine or 
10.

3239
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:29,100
Now 10:00
will be lunch.

3240
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:34,730
That's when you use a lot of weird 
schedule pick up lunch and then from 

3241
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,710
that point on I will just read,
I would read from 10:00

3242
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:35,710
AM

3243
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,570
until like 11 at night and I take an 
hour break to workout.

3244
02:07:39,930 --> 02:07:41,050
Wow.
Wow.

3245
02:07:41,150 --> 02:07:44,350
I mean I read the second year I kept 
tracking with 117 books.

3246
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:45,860
Wow.
But um,

3247
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,370
I mean there's nothing I could have read
way more,

3248
02:07:48,371 --> 02:07:49,570
but you will not of books,
you know,

3249
02:07:49,571 --> 02:07:51,040
you're out of books.
It's so boring.

3250
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,990
I want to come out of myself every other
day for an hour,

3251
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:58,710
you know what I mean?
And then just like a just fucking board 

3252
02:07:58,710 --> 02:08:01,741
dude.
What is it like to not talk to people 

3253
02:08:01,741 --> 02:08:01,741
for so long?
I mean,

3254
02:08:01,741 --> 02:08:01,741
you,
you talked to.

3255
02:08:01,741 --> 02:08:05,850
I mean it's just weird dude.
It's like a to neighborhood.

3256
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:08,770
It's like a fucking time warp because 
when you're in there,

3257
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:13,600
the day goes by real slow with like the 
months go by quick and then when you get

3258
02:08:13,601 --> 02:08:15,110
out it's just like,
it was like,

3259
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:15,850
it was all a dream.

3260
02:08:15,850 --> 02:08:16,870
He didn't.
Even if you weren't even in there,

3261
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,210
it's weirdly folks through your head.
And then like,

3262
02:08:19,211 --> 02:08:21,200
uh,
it was whoa man,

3263
02:08:21,201 --> 02:08:23,680
the underfed is so bad.
Do they fucking underfed is bad.

3264
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,030
Yeah.
And las vegas real bad.

3265
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:30,640
UH,
I was trying to calculate how much 

3266
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:30,640
protein I thought that was getting 
today.

3267
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,480
And it was like 20,
30 grams did.

3268
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:33,010
Whoa.
And here's,

3269
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:38,040
here's,
I know it was bullshit because this is 

3270
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:38,040
vegas.
Especially if it's ending.

3271
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:41,770
He goes better in vegas.
We only got a piece of fruit like twice 

3272
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:43,090
a week.
So like we got like an orange like twice

3273
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:44,000
or three times a week.
That's it.

3274
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,850
But we're just made with her.
Was it right?

3275
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:47,980
So maybe with a got there,
do hIs,

3276
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:52,070
his two months ends fucking he started 
bitching at the,

3277
02:08:52,071 --> 02:08:57,071
at the judge,
like they're not feeding me enough to 

3278
02:08:57,071 --> 02:08:57,071
give me shit free,
blah blah blah,

3279
02:08:57,071 --> 02:08:57,071
blah.

3280
02:08:57,071 --> 02:08:58,630
All of a sudden,
bam fruit everyday.

3281
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,750
Big portions.
All this shit for all of you.

3282
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:02,470
Everyone.
Right?

3283
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:03,550
Because I know why.
I know why.

3284
02:09:03,551 --> 02:09:06,760
Because they were scared me.
Whether it's camp was going to have the,

3285
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:08,930
the people that feed us,
you know,

3286
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:09,990
investigating.
Yeah.

3287
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:11,350
You know.
And guess what,

3288
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:14,110
the second he left went away.
Wow.

3289
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:15,130
No shit.
I swear to god.

3290
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:20,360
And I told the,
I told one of the cool god's name and 

3291
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:20,360
come here.
I said,

3292
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,130
you notice motHerfucker that as soon as 
me with her started bitching at court,

3293
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:23,990
now we've got bigger trades and we got 
fruit every day.

3294
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:26,330
And then he started chuckling and he 
laughed.

3295
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:27,880
He walked away.
But it's like they knew,

3296
02:09:27,881 --> 02:09:32,881
they knew what was up.
They were undefeated in the fuck out of 

3297
02:09:32,881 --> 02:09:32,881
us.
So what it like,

3298
02:09:32,881 --> 02:09:33,760
how many calories do you think you get a
day did?

3299
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:37,360
It was,
it was shit I hard to say,

3300
02:09:37,361 --> 02:09:39,100
but no more than.
Less than $1,500.

3301
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:40,770
Wow.
It was bad dude.

3302
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:43,000
It was fucking starving all the time.
So it must have been.

3303
02:09:43,001 --> 02:09:44,830
Everyone was skinny then?
yeah,

3304
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:46,780
unless you get.
If you had money in the commissary,

3305
02:09:46,781 --> 02:09:49,180
you can buy junk food.
They sell chips and bullshit like that.

3306
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:51,310
But that said they don't sound like 
healthy options.

3307
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,420
Peanuts was the best.
Well,

3308
02:09:53,670 --> 02:09:55,570
I,
I love on peanuts,

3309
02:09:55,690 --> 02:09:56,450
but um,
and,

3310
02:09:56,451 --> 02:10:01,090
but then if the food was bad,
man it was real bad.

3311
02:10:01,091 --> 02:10:02,680
That was the worst part is so for a 
year,

3312
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:05,890
just bad food by yourself.
Reading books.

3313
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:07,870
Daddy just going crazy in there.
What about,

3314
02:10:07,871 --> 02:10:12,871
um,
what does it feel like to not talk to 

3315
02:10:12,871 --> 02:10:12,871
people for so long?

3316
02:10:13,530 --> 02:10:15,210
It's one,
it's a,

3317
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:21,390
it's weird.
You don't know untiL you get out when 

3318
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:21,390
you get out of here,
like culture shocked becAuse you know,

3319
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:25,420
you go from no interaction with nothing 
to like cars going by,

3320
02:10:25,421 --> 02:10:26,650
you know what I mean?
Just like whoa,

3321
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:28,540
you know,
like me,

3322
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:33,900
I take,
I take a medicine for anxiety and 

3323
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:33,900
depression.
I take lexapro because got,

3324
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:35,570
I have panic attacks and anxiety.
I'll be honest.

3325
02:10:35,571 --> 02:10:38,570
It was like 2006 lexa pros and 
antidepressants.

3326
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,920
Ssri.
Yeah.

3327
02:10:40,420 --> 02:10:43,030
Mostly I take it for anxiety,
[inaudible] I would get panic attacks.

3328
02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:48,130
It was just my dad died out.
I would get them and then like I just 

3329
02:10:48,130 --> 02:10:48,460
battled them all my whole life and try 
to like,

3330
02:10:48,461 --> 02:10:49,040
oh,
you know,

3331
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:50,810
like I don't want to go to doctor 
doctors for postseason.

3332
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:52,040
No medicines for pussies,
you know,

3333
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:57,460
and finally,
actually when avenue was on ultra and 

3334
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:57,460
fighter house in the ultimate fighter 
house,

3335
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,140
like the,
the lack of a,

3336
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:01,520
I was so isolated,
nothing,

3337
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:02,400
do nothing.

3338
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:08,260
It really got me bad and I was having 
anxiety attacks on the show and it was 

3339
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:08,260
just like I was a mess.
Right.

3340
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:10,910
So when I got the ultimate fighter house
I find say fuck this man,

3341
02:11:10,911 --> 02:11:15,911
I'm not,
I'm not gonna pretend to be tough 

3342
02:11:15,911 --> 02:11:15,911
anymore.
I'm going to go try to get help,

3343
02:11:15,911 --> 02:11:17,180
you know.
And that shit made me 95 percent better,

3344
02:11:17,181 --> 02:11:18,680
you know,
in a lot of ways.

3345
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,380
But when I was in san diego that gave it
to me and they just,

3346
02:11:21,381 --> 02:11:23,240
they wouldn't give it to me really?
Yeah.

3347
02:11:23,241 --> 02:11:24,590
They fucking want give it to me.
They're dicks.

3348
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:27,850
So the whole year we admitted degas was 
worse because I had none.

3349
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:30,320
I had a lot of anxiety in there.
And did you,

3350
02:11:30,321 --> 02:11:35,321
when is there like a um,
like a wean off period or did you just 

3351
02:11:35,321 --> 02:11:36,320
cold cold Turkey?
Cold Turkey.

3352
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:37,400
Me and you get withdrawals.

3353
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:40,340
So like the first,
the first three weeks I was miserable.

3354
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:41,570
Real,
real bad.

3355
02:11:41,571 --> 02:11:43,970
Like I don't know,
it was bad.

3356
02:11:43,971 --> 02:11:44,400
Then I,
then I,

3357
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:46,340
then I settled down and that was kind of
good.

3358
02:11:46,341 --> 02:11:48,200
But I was just,
it was shitty.

3359
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:49,520
It was shitty.
Wow.

3360
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:52,760
So just a year of reading books and 
being by yourself.

3361
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:55,100
What about like hugging people and shit?
Yeah.

3362
02:11:55,101 --> 02:11:57,020
You see you get no,
no interaction like that.

3363
02:11:57,021 --> 02:12:02,021
And even the visits in san diego,
the visits were behind glass so you can 

3364
02:12:02,021 --> 02:12:04,340
actually see you,
which was a lot better in vegas.

3365
02:12:04,341 --> 02:12:08,120
The videos were on like a computer,
like a skype kind of thing,

3366
02:12:08,121 --> 02:12:13,121
you know?
So they would come there and they be 

3367
02:12:13,121 --> 02:12:15,251
there but you couldn't see them on skype
kind of thing and half the time the 

3368
02:12:15,251 --> 02:12:15,510
phone didn't work good.
Or the screens in orchid it was,

3369
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:20,540
it was really like after a while I just 
told the guards I don't want no visits 

3370
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:22,490
canceled my visits Because it made it 
harder for me.

3371
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:23,960
Like you know,
you watch movies,

3372
02:12:23,961 --> 02:12:25,800
like people were like in Vietnam movies,
they're lIke,

3373
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:28,040
like why don't you write me back?
You know,

3374
02:12:28,050 --> 02:12:29,090
like,
like I was in the war,

3375
02:12:29,091 --> 02:12:34,091
I want to focus on the ward.
I did write back and other families or 

3376
02:12:34,091 --> 02:12:36,281
whatever I can understand because when I
was there I didn't want any fucking 

3377
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:36,281
business.
I didn't want,

3378
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:37,070
I didn't call anybody,
I didn't,

3379
02:12:37,071 --> 02:12:40,290
I just sat there and read my books and I
did my,

3380
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:42,140
my jail blogs every,
every week.

3381
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:43,000
Yeah.
I've read those,

3382
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:48,120
had those and I just,
I decided there and just you're in a 

3383
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:49,340
bubble man.
It was hard for me because when I was in

3384
02:12:49,341 --> 02:12:51,350
jail,
like my,

3385
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:54,590
I was married and my wife got deported 
back to Hungary and all this shit.

3386
02:12:54,591 --> 02:12:56,180
So like I didn't even get to say 
goodbye.

3387
02:12:56,181 --> 02:12:59,390
My grandma died when I was in jail and 
it was like my grandma was living,

3388
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:04,480
my grandma was living in vegas like 
fucking 10 minutes from the jail and I 

3389
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:04,480
could even say bias.

3390
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:05,240
SHe was dying of cancer.
She died,

3391
02:13:05,241 --> 02:13:07,100
you know?
And it was like,

3392
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:08,840
it was,
it was rough.

3393
02:13:08,841 --> 02:13:13,841
It was a rough year last year.
So do you get young kids who might like 

3394
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:17,780
look up to you and they might be kind of
going down the same path,

3395
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:22,810
the.
Do you get guys like that coming up to 

3396
02:13:22,810 --> 02:13:22,810
you for advice and you tell them just 
don't go to jail,

3397
02:13:22,810 --> 02:13:23,480
man.
Whatever you do,

3398
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:26,870
figure out a way to get out of trouble,
figure out a way to avoid violence.

3399
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:27,760
Yeah.
You kNow,

3400
02:13:27,761 --> 02:13:30,120
I do that even in jail,
you know,

3401
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:32,820
I would talk to guys I'm,
I'm not as there for a fight.

3402
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:34,610
And I've talked to other guys like,
you know,

3403
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:37,410
especially the first year I was there 
when I was in general population.

3404
02:13:37,610 --> 02:13:39,030
Now I try to help them.
Like amen.

3405
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:43,340
You're not going to fucking quit the 
drugs if you go get back out and handled

3406
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:44,010
the same friends.

3407
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:46,860
Like this is the bottom line.
You got to quit your friends,

3408
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:48,990
you've got to get new friends and new 
environment or you're going to go back.

3409
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:50,430
I don't give a fuck.
So you know what I mean?

3410
02:13:50,431 --> 02:13:51,920
Like these guys,
I will say this,

3411
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:53,790
seeing that's my problem is fighting,
right?

3412
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:55,380
If I go to a bar,
you're drunk.

3413
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,540
It's not,
I'm not going to look for a fight,

3414
02:13:57,541 --> 02:13:58,950
but guess what,
if something happens,

3415
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,650
I know it's a bad recipe,
you know,

3416
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:03,060
you're trying your problems,
cocaine,

3417
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:05,430
but when you get out you better not be 
around your friends with the cocaine.

3418
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:07,430
So I would tell the guys like,
you know,

3419
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:10,470
it ain't worth it motherfucker.
And these gangs gang bullshit.

3420
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:15,980
I see like young kids who were 17,
they brought state from juvenile hall 

3421
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:18,290
fighting a murder case and he was like 
17 old kid.

3422
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:20,490
He didn't even do it.
His friend did it,

3423
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:23,710
but he's not going to rack rack.
Do you know he's,

3424
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:26,540
he's in a gang and shit.
But I said many of your friends,

3425
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:28,050
a piece of shit.
He doesn't mean he did it cause you guys

3426
02:14:28,051 --> 02:14:29,430
are both.
They both get life,

3427
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:30,960
you know,
because life's ruined.

3428
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:32,040
so I'll tell you.
Oh you young kids,

3429
02:14:32,041 --> 02:14:33,060
man,
it ain't worth it man.

3430
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:37,170
Talk to the older guys.
Know I got to tell you,

3431
02:14:37,171 --> 02:14:38,070
the older guys always like,
man,

3432
02:14:38,071 --> 02:14:39,690
this is bullshit.
I wish I could take my life back,

3433
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:40,920
but it's too late.
So.

3434
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:43,310
And when you're in the wrong 
environment,

3435
02:14:43,311 --> 02:14:44,690
man,
especially with alcohol,

3436
02:14:44,691 --> 02:14:49,691
it's so easy to get in trouble.
I mean that story that you told about 

3437
02:14:49,691 --> 02:14:49,940
the old man that pushed the tow truck 
driver.

3438
02:14:49,941 --> 02:14:51,440
And then next thing you know he'S in 
jail.

3439
02:14:51,441 --> 02:14:54,560
The next thing you know he murdered a 
guy in jail and next thing you know he's

3440
02:14:54,561 --> 02:14:59,561
probably in jail for life.
Who knows what happened to him because 

3441
02:14:59,561 --> 02:14:59,561
he couldn't afford a good lawyer.
He was poor.

3442
02:14:59,561 --> 02:15:00,500
You know,
we've got a real problem with.

3443
02:15:00,501 --> 02:15:02,690
That is a real problem with that 
situation,

3444
02:15:02,691 --> 02:15:06,680
that particular story that's like this 
hard by the book shit.

3445
02:15:06,681 --> 02:15:11,681
we,
they don't look at each individual case 

3446
02:15:11,681 --> 02:15:11,681
as being a separate entity and say,
oh,

3447
02:15:11,681 --> 02:15:13,370
these are circumstances that are pretty 
unusual.

3448
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:15,620
I see what's going on here.
This guy's not a criminal.

3449
02:15:15,621 --> 02:15:18,980
He just overreacted.
You can overreact like that

3450
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,510
dude,
you got to go.

3451
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:22,110
I've been in court because we go to 
court,

3452
02:15:22,111 --> 02:15:27,111
you know,
like they bring the whole bus of us to 

3453
02:15:27,111 --> 02:15:27,111
go to court sometimes.
And like you watch the judges,

3454
02:15:27,111 --> 02:15:29,430
men given out 15 years,
10 years,

3455
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:34,620
like not,
not even looking at but from the paper 

3456
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:34,620
10 years.
Like it's like what the fuck.

3457
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:36,390
Like this guy has given out years.
like they don't understand how long that

3458
02:15:36,391 --> 02:15:37,230
is,
that they don't care.

3459
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:38,460
They don't care.
They have no.

3460
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:41,220
And sometimes sometimes the guy who 
deserve a dude,

3461
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:42,930
but sometimes it's like fuck.

3462
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:48,490
When you heard about that judge in 
Pennsylvania that was putting kids in 

3463
02:15:48,490 --> 02:15:49,290
juvenile detention centers and getting 
paid for it,

3464
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:51,290
he was doing it for years.
He just went to jaiL.

3465
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:55,440
They sentenced him to 25 plus years.
He's a fucking judge man.

3466
02:15:55,441 --> 02:16:00,441
And he was getting payoffs because of 
the same thing we talked about about 

3467
02:16:00,441 --> 02:16:03,950
privatized prisons,
about prisons making profit off of the 

3468
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:03,950
amount of people that they have in them.
Dude,

3469
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:06,930
fucking madness man.
It's fucking so you get out.

3470
02:16:06,980 --> 02:16:07,510
All right.
You're,

3471
02:16:07,511 --> 02:16:09,420
you're there for a year.
Shit.

3472
02:16:09,421 --> 02:16:12,270
Diet.
Fucking no human interaction.

3473
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:13,290
What is your first week like?

3474
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:21,000
So I get out.
And then how long before you get some 

3475
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:21,000
pussy?
Well that's the thing.

3476
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,930
So I,
when I first got out I was,

3477
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:25,260
I was so like,
oh man,

3478
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:27,010
like I'm like a,
what's it called?

3479
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:28,960
Conceited or whatever.
I had to look good.

3480
02:16:29,430 --> 02:16:34,430
I,
my whole life I've been in shape whole 

3481
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:34,430
life,
been working out.

3482
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:34,430
so when I got out of jail,
like I feel like insecure.

3483
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:35,390
Like I,
I'm skinny,

3484
02:16:35,430 --> 02:16:37,340
I'm like skinny fat,
I just have a shitty body,

3485
02:16:37,341 --> 02:16:38,470
a pale,
I feel ugly.

3486
02:16:38,471 --> 02:16:39,440
Right?
So I,

3487
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:44,460
I didn't go,
I didn't push it for a month because I 

3488
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:46,261
was trying to get decent schaefer's 
because I thought I just felt like 

3489
02:16:46,261 --> 02:16:49,060
insecurity plus the first,
both towns I got out of jail.

3490
02:16:49,061 --> 02:16:51,820
The first two weeks were hard man.
Like my anxiety is bad.

3491
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:52,440
Like,
like,

3492
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:55,240
like I didn't get on the lexapro right 
away when you got out?

3493
02:16:55,390 --> 02:16:56,480
Uh,
yeah.

3494
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:58,450
When I got out I tried it,
I got it right away.

3495
02:16:58,510 --> 02:17:01,860
So the first like ngo,
I didn't cry or in jail,

3496
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:03,430
not because I'm tough,
I just didn't cry.

3497
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:08,440
I don't know why even my grandpa died.
I didn't cry and I just sat there and 

3498
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:08,440
numb.
Right.

3499
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:09,430
But when I got out the first two weeks I
would cry every night in bed.

3500
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:15,120
What the fuck,
like getting out is so much shit's 

3501
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:15,210
hitting at the same time.
And just like,

3502
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:17,290
like when I first walked into the gym 
and I started crying,

3503
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,360
like,
just like too much emotion,

3504
02:17:19,361 --> 02:17:23,070
too much weird from going from no 
interaction to bam,

3505
02:17:23,090 --> 02:17:24,610
like on the freeway,
this,

3506
02:17:24,611 --> 02:17:26,260
that is that going crazy.
It's too much to,

3507
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:29,290
to any sensory overload and I can't even
explain it.

3508
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:31,420
It was just fucking weird.
Really weird.

3509
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:32,030
And I'm like,
dude,

3510
02:17:32,050 --> 02:17:33,040
you didn't expect that.

3511
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:34,470
And suicidal too.
Like I was gonna kill me.

3512
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:35,830
Like I want to kill myself.
Really?

3513
02:17:36,170 --> 02:17:38,470
Yeah.
And what was,

3514
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:41,410
what was the motivation to kill 
yourself?

3515
02:17:41,411 --> 02:17:44,910
Like what were you,
what was so upset aBout It?

3516
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,000
Just the uh,
your,

3517
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:47,160
your,
you get overloaded with,

3518
02:17:47,161 --> 02:17:49,210
with emotion to the.
I don't know,

3519
02:17:49,211 --> 02:17:53,950
it's weird that you can't go out.
You can't go from like being in a box to

3520
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:56,470
real life.
They should like gradually,

3521
02:17:56,471 --> 02:17:58,150
like adjusting to a halfway house.
I don't know,

3522
02:17:58,151 --> 02:18:00,850
something,
something because just it's too much,

3523
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:03,370
too much at one time.
Like now everything's real.

3524
02:18:03,371 --> 02:18:04,480
When I was in jail,
nothing's real.

3525
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:05,930
When you're in jail,
it's like a,

3526
02:18:06,350 --> 02:18:08,080
it's a fake world man.
It doesn't seem real.

3527
02:18:08,081 --> 02:18:13,081
And you get out and it's like that was a
dream and now all of a sudden your wife 

3528
02:18:13,081 --> 02:18:13,900
really got the port at your grandma's 
really did.

3529
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:16,180
Your grandpa was really miserable as 
fuck.

3530
02:18:16,980 --> 02:18:18,010
Dan wants to die,
you know,

3531
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:23,020
like you got to pay bills now.
TheY want me to find paul daily right 

3532
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:24,430
off the bat in three months.
What the fuck?

3533
02:18:24,431 --> 02:18:27,470
You know,
I'm like too much stress and I use,

3534
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:28,010
you know,
you,

3535
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:31,480
you started going crazy dude.
And like you just feel like miserable.

3536
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:34,190
The hardest part about jail for me was 
getting out the first few,

3537
02:18:34,191 --> 02:18:36,130
few weeks.
That's a crazy thing is.

3538
02:18:36,131 --> 02:18:38,500
So this is the door.
This is your beltour contract.

3539
02:18:38,501 --> 02:18:40,090
They wanted you to fight daily.
Three weeks,

3540
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:41,680
three months after you got out of jail.
Yeah.

3541
02:18:41,681 --> 02:18:46,030
Because what they did was they did a fan
fight vote when I was in jail.

3542
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:50,260
Me daily,
saunders and lima and like the fans vote

3543
02:18:50,261 --> 02:18:52,030
and whoever wins the top two bolts is 
going to win.

3544
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:57,840
I said,
if you want to say I'm going to limit 

3545
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:57,840
the dumb ass,
I'm going to win.

3546
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:57,840
So no you're not.
I said,

3547
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:58,030
I'm going to fucking win the vote,
dude.

3548
02:18:58,330 --> 02:18:59,300
No one else is gonna.
Get more posts,

3549
02:18:59,301 --> 02:19:00,010
man.
I'm telling you dude,

3550
02:19:00,070 --> 02:19:01,480
I don't want to.
I don't want to fight.

3551
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:03,520
I don't wanna fight.
None of those guys.

3552
02:19:03,521 --> 02:19:05,170
My first fight after three months,
three months ago,

3553
02:19:05,810 --> 02:19:10,810
you're not going to win and do fucking.
I wouldn't buy like 10 times as many 

3554
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:15,471
opposed to anyone else.
It was like me versus daily was number 

3555
02:19:15,471 --> 02:19:15,471
one.
Then we didn't meet her honors meters,

3556
02:19:15,471 --> 02:19:15,910
lima.
I was like,

3557
02:19:15,911 --> 02:19:16,290
fuck.
Okay.

3558
02:19:16,291 --> 02:19:17,710
So don't find daily first.
Like whatever.

3559
02:19:17,711 --> 02:19:22,711
Right?
Then what do they say to you when you 

3560
02:19:22,711 --> 02:19:22,711
bring that up?
Like I told you,

3561
02:19:22,711 --> 02:19:22,711
pitch.
I was like,

3562
02:19:22,711 --> 02:19:22,711
told you.
They're like,

3563
02:19:22,711 --> 02:19:22,890
fuck man.
Like you,

3564
02:19:22,891 --> 02:19:24,290
you killed it.
Yeah.

3565
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:25,540
I'm like,
but it wasn't like,

3566
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:27,590
it wasn't even a.
And then was a tournament.

3567
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:30,410
So trauma is three fights.
So I was like,

3568
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:32,330
it was the first finance.
So fucked man.

3569
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:37,340
I'm getting the first.
It's like basically you got your number 

3570
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,660
two top seeds.
Most popular guys fighting in the first 

3571
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:39,660
fight for at least amount of money 
because you know,

3572
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:41,000
graduate,
it's like 77,

3573
02:19:41,001 --> 02:19:42,320
the first bite,
50 and 15.

3574
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:47,321
Then the rest.
So it's like we're losing the first 

3575
02:19:47,321 --> 02:19:47,321
round.
I make seven grand.

3576
02:19:47,321 --> 02:19:48,170
It's like neither one of us want to make
seven grand.

3577
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:49,340
Like fuck,
that's so crazy.

3578
02:19:49,341 --> 02:19:52,130
Seven grand for a professional mma fight
on television.

3579
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:53,710
Yeah.
But I'm glad.

3580
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:56,250
Was the standard the same thing in ufc 
too,

3581
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:57,430
you know,
with everyone for lower.

3582
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:58,280
But yeah,
for anyone,

3583
02:19:58,281 --> 02:20:03,281
you know.
But either way like put the tournaments 

3584
02:20:03,281 --> 02:20:03,281
good because a tournament should be 
seated.

3585
02:20:03,281 --> 02:20:07,960
So the two guys,
the two best guys should fight at the 

3586
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:07,960
end is not in the beginning.

3587
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:08,510
No.
So it was like fuck.

3588
02:20:08,511 --> 02:20:09,730
Anyway,
I'm training,

3589
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:12,410
getting back in shape and a month until 
I tore my acl.

3590
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:15,670
So I teaR my acl.
not a,

3591
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:20,830
not a bad thing all the way through,
but the tear partial and I fractured my 

3592
02:20:20,830 --> 02:20:24,650
tibia tibia plateau.
It's like,

3593
02:20:24,670 --> 02:20:29,670
fuck,
so I just got out and now this happens 

3594
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:29,670
and I blamed on the nutrition.
I think my body,

3595
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:33,720
my bones were still leached from,
from that whole year of starving and bad

3596
02:20:33,721 --> 02:20:35,420
nutrition in it.
I've never been hurt before.

3597
02:20:35,421 --> 02:20:37,120
You know it right away.
Bam.

3598
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:38,750
My tee shirt.
It didn't help.

3599
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:44,380
It didn't help being out of shApe like 
that and force yourself to get trained 

3600
02:20:44,380 --> 02:20:45,530
in a high level.
I tear that then.

3601
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:46,970
No,
no,

3602
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:48,240
no.
I started at a fixer.

3603
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,670
Really?
How bad is it?

3604
02:20:50,790 --> 02:20:52,280
Buckle.
Not as buckle.

3605
02:20:52,281 --> 02:20:54,530
It's pretty strong.
It was a partial tear.

3606
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:54,890
It's partially.

3607
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:55,610
Yeah,
it wasn't bad.

3608
02:20:55,950 --> 02:20:59,480
It wasn't habit in any way to do 
prolotherapy poor.

3609
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:00,620
I'm poor,
you know,

3610
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:02,840
a guy got really poor,
you know,

3611
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:05,360
like when I got out of jail was living 
in my students garage,

3612
02:21:06,210 --> 02:21:07,670
like the garage,
like,

3613
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:09,500
you know,
and I was driving this piece of shit car

3614
02:21:09,501 --> 02:21:11,120
and like I was broke as fuck,
you know,

3615
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:15,170
so I just sucked it up and uh,
you know,

3616
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:17,060
I feel it.
How do you make money then?

3617
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:19,280
I don't remember.
That made money.

3618
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:24,400
So how you been fighting for?
How long have you been fighting for 

3619
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:24,400
beltour now?
Um,

3620
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:25,190
since,
since the last year.

3621
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:30,550
So then after I fixed my knee,
I went and filed a blossom aina first 

3622
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:34,841
fight back.
It killed in a Second round with 

3623
02:21:34,841 --> 02:21:34,841
crucifix.
Then,

3624
02:21:34,841 --> 02:21:38,921
um,
then I went to the tournament and I 

3625
02:21:38,921 --> 02:21:39,190
fought a skype on anderson who's from 
China?

3626
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:39,510
White guy.

3627
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:44,560
The guy beat him jailbird it was dick.
She has things like me,

3628
02:21:45,471 --> 02:21:50,060
like I don't ever talk shit about my 
opponents like outside,

3629
02:21:50,061 --> 02:21:52,460
like mannequins,
but usually when I fIght I come,

3630
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:54,020
I'll fight,
I'll fight your hardest.

3631
02:21:54,021 --> 02:21:54,590
I can,
but I don't,

3632
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:59,591
I'm not gonna say shit.
But if you started the nightmare 

3633
02:21:59,591 --> 02:22:01,370
personally and I don't have,
to me you cross land,

3634
02:22:01,371 --> 02:22:06,371
cross land and that's it.
I don't play the fucking bullshit game 

3635
02:22:06,371 --> 02:22:06,371
of like,
oh,

3636
02:22:06,371 --> 02:22:10,130
it's for sure for sure.
That motherfucker like if you want to 

3637
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:10,130
play the game,
it's really for me.

3638
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:12,830
What do you thInk about the situation of
bell tour?

3639
02:22:12,831 --> 02:22:15,890
That I thought was really strange was 
the chandler situation,

3640
02:22:15,891 --> 02:22:18,830
the chandler and alvarez situation and 
then the aspirin thing.

3641
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,440
Like how did they let him go when he's 
the champ?

3642
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:24,920
You know what a like bellow tour.
It is awesome.

3643
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:26,850
The creamy good.
Yeah.

3644
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:27,660
I liked him a lot,
right?

3645
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:30,840
I think an aspirin,
I think really.

3646
02:22:31,710 --> 02:22:34,260
He's a nightmare dude.
He's a fucking nightmare.

3647
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:39,560
He's invincible.
He's boring and no one wants to see him 

3648
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:40,020
fight the truth and they created a 
monster.

3649
02:22:40,021 --> 02:22:42,150
You know what I mean?
So he wanted to go good.

3650
02:22:42,151 --> 02:22:44,120
Get the fuck out of here.
It was like,

3651
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:46,460
it was almost like they let alvarez go.
Right.

3652
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:50,100
Why is marketable?
Because he fights wild asking.

3653
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:55,160
No one wants it.
He's done so many fans and the ufc 

3654
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:55,160
didn't want him either because he's one 
of you would have asked.

3655
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,300
She goes in and beats everyone.
I'm I want to see it.

3656
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:58,050
Yeah,
he won't.

3657
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:59,640
He has no hands.
But what if we did.

3658
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,840
Then you got this fucking guy,
that women prior to that,

3659
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:04,880
when lynn was invincible,
right.

3660
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:08,000
He lost one time to fucking dave trail.

3661
02:23:08,490 --> 02:23:13,490
They fired him because they're like,
thank god we got rid of matt lindland 

3662
02:23:13,490 --> 02:23:13,490
because he was.
He was not marketable.

3663
02:23:13,490 --> 02:23:14,160
Found eco vitaly too.
And knocked himself out.

3664
02:23:14,161 --> 02:23:18,420
Remember he went to lateral,
dropped him still.

3665
02:23:18,421 --> 02:23:20,820
He didn't deserve yet fired yet.
But they wanted rid of them.

3666
02:23:20,821 --> 02:23:21,990
You know what I mean?
Suplex.

3667
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:24,110
They want to rid of them.
Yeah,

3668
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:24,960
no,
for sure.

3669
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:27,720
So like not as koreans didn't know.
Massland asking fucked up.

3670
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:32,721
he should have stayed in builder.
Now what's he gonna do now is going to 

3671
02:23:32,721 --> 02:23:32,721
fight in China.
Nfc,

3672
02:23:32,721 --> 02:23:33,360
right?
Yeah.

3673
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:35,610
But is there any more?
I think they're paying them good though.

3674
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:40,670
They have to be,
but like he's out of the most exposure 

3675
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:45,111
is obviously the fight in the ufc belt 
was the second most exposure that you 

3676
02:23:45,111 --> 02:23:45,111
can get.
What else?

3677
02:23:45,111 --> 02:23:45,111
You.
No one's gonna watch.

3678
02:23:45,111 --> 02:23:45,390
Who's going to watch?

3679
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:47,060
Man?
Me personally,

3680
02:23:47,061 --> 02:23:52,061
I'm a purist and I feel like if there's 
a guy like ben asking that can hold you 

3681
02:23:52,061 --> 02:23:54,320
down and dry hump you for five rounds,
that's what he can do.

3682
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:59,440
Like if that guy should be able to fight
and if he could take guys down and give 

3683
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,890
them the buggies and elbow him and punch
him in the head and,

3684
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,340
and hold everybody down for five rounds,
then that's reality.

3685
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,470
That's reality.
You can't.

3686
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:10,480
You can't hide that.
You can't not have that guy fight 

3687
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:10,480
because you're worried he's going to be 
boring.

3688
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:12,530
He's doing everything according to the 
rules.

3689
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:17,620
Like you can't like penalize a guy 
because you don't particularly like his 

3690
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:20,210
style and that's my issue that I have 
with every organization does.

3691
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:22,280
I think they're crazy.
I would never do it.

3692
02:24:22,281 --> 02:24:24,950
If I was running bella tour,
I would have given the guy who's fucking

3693
02:24:24,951 --> 02:24:25,190
money.

3694
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:26,660
He's the champ.
Nobody could beat him.

3695
02:24:26,661 --> 02:24:28,370
It's kind of interesting.
It's kind of interesting.

3696
02:24:28,371 --> 02:24:31,010
you've got a boring champ.
You've got a guy like douglas lema who's

3697
02:24:31,011 --> 02:24:32,930
just fucking beast.
Smashing people.

3698
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,280
Then was fish too.
Vicious,

3699
02:24:34,281 --> 02:24:36,860
vicious dude.
Takes him down like nothing.

3700
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:39,510
Cookie sandwiches,
bitch pizzas.

3701
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:43,130
That lean was a huge giant ashlyn.
Small farewell walter,

3702
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:46,040
and they asked her to take some down.
No problem man,

3703
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:49,100
handle them,
but it all comes down to to the ratings.

3704
02:24:49,101 --> 02:24:50,510
Dude.
I don't give a fuck.

3705
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:53,720
I really think that the ratings are very
important,

3706
02:24:53,721 --> 02:24:56,130
but the product has to be pure.
As soon as you.

3707
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:59,000
You fuck with things like you remember 
what elite ecc was?

3708
02:24:59,001 --> 02:25:01,340
Standing people out.
They'd go down for like 15 seconds.

3709
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:03,190
Stand the most bullshit.
They stood up.

3710
02:25:03,191 --> 02:25:06,260
Big country.
He had andre arlovski inside control and

3711
02:25:06,261 --> 02:25:08,060
he's Working on komora and they stood 
him up.

3712
02:25:08,390 --> 02:25:10,400
He had this,
he had the double wrist lock.

3713
02:25:10,401 --> 02:25:12,290
He had the whole thing up there and they
stood them up,

3714
02:25:12,291 --> 02:25:15,500
but I was like,
out is this side control.

3715
02:25:15,501 --> 02:25:16,520
You're standing.
The guy up,

3716
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:19,400
they still dudes up from the mount guys 
are full mountain.

3717
02:25:19,401 --> 02:25:21,500
They stood them up.
It's crazy.

3718
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:25,740
They wanted to be almost no ground time.
They want almost no ground time,

3719
02:25:25,930 --> 02:25:28,990
but when you do that,
you change in what mma really is.

3720
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:32,410
Mma is a fight and in those five minutes
you have some specific rules.

3721
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:35,410
You can't kick in the groin.
Camp poke in the eyes can pull guys here

3722
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:36,400
go.
I mean,

3723
02:25:36,401 --> 02:25:38,110
you know what the rules are.
Don't kick it down upon it.

3724
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:43,180
Everything else you could do and if a 
guy like asking could just take dudes 

3725
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:45,160
down and get on top of him and punch him
in the face and they can't do shit about

3726
02:25:45,161 --> 02:25:45,400
it.

3727
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:47,350
I mean he's winning within the rules.
He was winning.

3728
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:49,420
you got to let them win.
You got to let them win.

3729
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:51,360
You got to let them try to win this.
The only,

3730
02:25:51,390 --> 02:25:56,390
the only reason I could think why they 
didn't keep them and why the use of why 

3731
02:25:56,390 --> 02:25:56,390
didn't you want them?
Listen.

3732
02:25:56,390 --> 02:26:00,391
If the ufc took him and then he fights 
johny hendricks and gets put into 

3733
02:26:00,391 --> 02:26:00,640
night-night land.
That's fantastic.

3734
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:01,890
That's interesting.
Will see.

3735
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:03,040
I think a scared.
Maybe he won't.

3736
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:04,750
He could.
It's possible.

3737
02:26:04,751 --> 02:26:07,120
It's totally possible.
If you look at his record.

3738
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:09,390
Well one guy gave him a hard time.
Jay here on game.

3739
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:11,770
A real hard Time with this.
We can wrestle inbox.

3740
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:13,900
He could wrestle any.
I don't think.

3741
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:16,930
I think hendrix would would have killed 
them at cost check.

3742
02:26:16,931 --> 02:26:18,970
I think we're killing anyone that 
anyone's going to wrestle and punch,

3743
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:19,870
but I want to see it.

3744
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:25,540
I want to see it too.
I want to see a guy be effective until 

3745
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:26,620
he can't be effective anymore.
Like when people said like they asked me

3746
02:26:26,621 --> 02:26:31,621
like,
were you sad when anderson silva got 

3747
02:26:31,621 --> 02:26:31,621
beat?
I was like,

3748
02:26:31,621 --> 02:26:31,621
no,
I'm never sad when anybody gets beat.

3749
02:26:31,621 --> 02:26:34,150
I'm sad if someone gets hurt.
I was more sad the second fight to see a

3750
02:26:34,151 --> 02:26:39,151
dude fuck his leg up like that.
But I want to see a guy like anderson 

3751
02:26:39,151 --> 02:26:41,350
silva who looks invincible,
get a guy,

3752
02:26:41,351 --> 02:26:44,140
figured that out.
That's the evolution of the game.

3753
02:26:44,141 --> 02:26:45,910
It's all about that.
And if it was,

3754
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:47,140
you know,
whoever it was,

3755
02:26:47,141 --> 02:26:49,450
whether it was vittorio was chris 
weidman,

3756
02:26:49,451 --> 02:26:52,060
whoever it is.
I like to see these guys figure it out.

3757
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:56,770
I like to see a guy salva guy,
but I mean that's the only reason that I

3758
02:26:56,771 --> 02:26:58,000
can say why you sit in silence.

3759
02:26:58,750 --> 02:26:59,840
I don't see it.
I mean,

3760
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:04,860
I don't understand what it is.
I think it was also the issue that they 

3761
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:05,800
felt that a bell tour was playing games 
and like bella tour was,

3762
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:07,930
you know,
like they might know,

3763
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:10,780
oh we we cast off are.
We didn't even want them anymore.

3764
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:12,010
The ufc took them,
ha ha,

3765
02:27:12,290 --> 02:27:13,600
they're dummies.
That guy's boring.

3766
02:27:13,750 --> 02:27:17,080
And when bjorn was saying that,
I'm not a fan of his style,

3767
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:18,690
you know,
like the guys affected.

3768
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:23,700
But he's kind of boring.
Like I don't find them boring as a 

3769
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:25,240
person who grapples.
I get fascinated by how the fuck he does

3770
02:27:25,241 --> 02:27:26,830
it.
I don't know why I want to roll with the

3771
02:27:26,831 --> 02:27:28,930
guy because I want to feel it because I 
don't get it.

3772
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:30,740
I mean I see him manhandled dudes and 
I've,

3773
02:27:30,741 --> 02:27:33,790
I've wrestled dudes that are real.
You know what Eric Bradley is,

3774
02:27:34,430 --> 02:27:35,530
but high level wrestler.

3775
02:27:35,530 --> 02:27:38,650
He was trading at 10th planet once we 
were doing these neon belly drills.

3776
02:27:38,980 --> 02:27:42,050
That dude threw me off him like I was a 
fucking pillow like this.

3777
02:27:42,190 --> 02:27:44,590
There's certain dudes are that creepy 
wrestling strength,

3778
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:47,320
you know?
And when I was on the bottom when he was

3779
02:27:47,321 --> 02:27:49,510
doing neon belly on me,
I wasn't going nowhere.

3780
02:27:49,511 --> 02:27:51,730
Man.
That's where I was staying.

3781
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:54,460
And he wasn't any bigger than me.
Like maybe 10 pounds bigger than me.

3782
02:27:54,461 --> 02:27:58,000
There's something weird that those who 
like olympic level,

3783
02:27:58,001 --> 02:28:01,540
high level grapplers have fucker was 
with yesterday,

3784
02:28:01,541 --> 02:28:03,970
the olympian,
silver medalist dude,

3785
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,020
he was on top of me,
bro.

3786
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,840
He's smaller than me first of all,
and I'm strong.

3787
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:10,810
He felt strongly as fuck.
Retarded,

3788
02:28:10,811 --> 02:28:13,900
like just so strong,
like a rock.

3789
02:28:14,330 --> 02:28:16,210
It was something else.
It's Your whole life.

3790
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:18,500
Just grappling.
Those guys develop freaky strain.

3791
02:28:18,501 --> 02:28:23,501
He just like,
he just went out there so he could hold 

3792
02:28:23,501 --> 02:28:23,501
me there,

3793
02:28:23,501 --> 02:28:24,110
but I couldn't.
I'm good at getting up.

3794
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:25,880
I was like,
fuck thiS guy off me,

3795
02:28:25,881 --> 02:28:26,090
dude.

3796
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:27,590
Yes.
Stuck.

3797
02:28:27,591 --> 02:28:28,060
I mean,
you know.

3798
02:28:28,310 --> 02:28:33,310
Yeah.
There's some freaky dudes like that man 

3799
02:28:33,310 --> 02:28:33,310
that have that freaky grapplers trying 
to.

3800
02:28:33,310 --> 02:28:34,520
Obviously aspirin has it beCause if you 
look at his body,

3801
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:36,590
I mean,
he doesn't look like a bodybuilder.

3802
02:28:36,950 --> 02:28:39,260
Oh,
it doesn't look strong and he looks like

3803
02:28:39,261 --> 02:28:44,261
an athlete,
but he doesn't look like your guy who 

3804
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:44,261
even does as much strength and 
conditioning.

3805
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:44,261
He's,
he's,

3806
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:44,261
uh,
he's uh,

3807
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:45,060
one of them freaks,
you know,

3808
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:47,780
he just ragdoll people.
It's weird to watch.

3809
02:28:47,781 --> 02:28:49,670
I was really looking forward to him when
they,

3810
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:52,160
when they said that that bell toward was
not going to sign them.

3811
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:55,900
I was looking forward to that guy beat 
in the ufc champion,

3812
02:28:55,950 --> 02:28:57,890
the ufc,
him and robbie lawler.

3813
02:28:57,891 --> 02:28:59,900
I would want to see if robbie gets 
stopped that tank down.

3814
02:28:59,901 --> 02:29:04,901
I want to see what the fuck.
What happens to him when he gets hit by 

3815
02:29:04,901 --> 02:29:04,901
a demon.

3816
02:29:04,901 --> 02:29:06,540
You know what if he gets in there with 
carlos condit and you know,

3817
02:29:06,550 --> 02:29:11,550
and he can't.
If conduct could stop the shot and he's 

3818
02:29:11,550 --> 02:29:14,051
got to stand up with them.
I want to see him against like the real 

3819
02:29:14,051 --> 02:29:16,811
high level guys.
Now there's going to be fighting dudes 

3820
02:29:16,811 --> 02:29:16,811
you never heard of in China,
you know?

3821
02:29:16,811 --> 02:29:17,350
Yeah.
Maybe.

3822
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,140
Okay.
You'll fight it.

3823
02:29:18,141 --> 02:29:19,760
Okay,
so he's over there,

3824
02:29:19,761 --> 02:29:20,520
right?
Yeah.

3825
02:29:20,530 --> 02:29:24,260
Without it was wrestling to death.
Do you feel like there's enough options?

3826
02:29:24,261 --> 02:29:29,261
I mean there's bella tour this ufc and 
then there's not this world series of 

3827
02:29:29,261 --> 02:29:33,281
fighting and then is a wfa.
There's a few other ones or what is the 

3828
02:29:33,281 --> 02:29:34,580
rfa rfa ad sources organization.

3829
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:39,980
I mean,
to me the only legit organizations as 

3830
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:41,140
you've seen bill her,
like roaches fridays is legit,

3831
02:29:41,141 --> 02:29:43,570
but I hasn't been,
I don't think it's going to last.

3832
02:29:43,571 --> 02:29:44,440
How long is gonna be around,
you know,

3833
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:47,810
these things pop up and then he 
disappeared and I heard the pain kind of

3834
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,900
too much and I don't know,
I just don't know if they haven't really

3835
02:29:51,901 --> 02:29:53,200
going to last.
You know whaT I'm saying?

3836
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:56,640
They're on nbc late at night,
but I heard they,

3837
02:29:56,830 --> 02:30:00,430
they pay for their spot and shit.
I don't know if it's true though because

3838
02:30:00,431 --> 02:30:02,230
the nbc is not promoting it,
you know what I mean?

3839
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:03,700
To me,
if you're not,

3840
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:06,130
you got to be in belt or a ufc one.
Bad ass too.

3841
02:30:06,131 --> 02:30:11,131
But you get no exposure.
You can't get sponsors because no one's 

3842
02:30:11,131 --> 02:30:11,131
going to see the fight.
You know what I mean?

3843
02:30:11,131 --> 02:30:15,661
So you got to be on american tv so 
you've got to be in either use your 

3844
02:30:15,661 --> 02:30:18,490
built or and to me like fucking a I am.

3845
02:30:18,610 --> 02:30:22,330
I'm happy at bell tour because they gave
me freedom dude.

3846
02:30:23,330 --> 02:30:26,050
Like I know goddamn well the people like
would you ever go back to the ufc?

3847
02:30:26,590 --> 02:30:29,080
Would I have liked to do?
See the question.

3848
02:30:29,081 --> 02:30:30,820
Doesn't matter.
That doesn't matter because guess what?

3849
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:33,820
I'll be fired everY week.
You know what I mean?

3850
02:30:33,821 --> 02:30:35,920
Like it doesn't matter.
Like just for your blowjob tweets.

3851
02:30:35,950 --> 02:30:37,420
Yeah,
I couldn't do shit.

3852
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:43,220
I'll be fired.
So it doesn't matter if I would like to 

3853
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:43,220
use that doesn't.
I don't want to care about it right now.

3854
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:44,600
What I want to do,
I want to fight for to her and I'm going

3855
02:30:44,601 --> 02:30:49,601
to win them and do good.
And now I'm gonna start this side 

3856
02:30:49,601 --> 02:30:52,771
business with mike,
with my navy seal friends and the tee 

3857
02:30:52,771 --> 02:30:52,771
shirt company.
And that's it.

3858
02:30:52,771 --> 02:30:54,100
I do alpha male shit.
Tee shirts,

3859
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:59,400
which is very funny.
I love those sharp tongue in cheek 

3860
02:30:59,400 --> 02:30:59,400
there.

3861
02:30:59,400 --> 02:30:59,680
Funny.
We know why.

3862
02:30:59,681 --> 02:31:04,681
It's because all these fires make the 
mistake of making a t shirt with like 

3863
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:06,800
war machine on it,
right?

3864
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,290
Not everyone knows who I am,
dude.

3865
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:11,590
And not everyone likes me.
So for years,

3866
02:31:11,591 --> 02:31:16,591
my fucking,
my little profile on my twitter and 

3867
02:31:16,591 --> 02:31:17,800
everything says all of a sudden instead 
of like ufc belt and he says,

3868
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:19,000
I do alpha male shit.
That's it.

3869
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:19,920
Right.
So I said,

3870
02:31:19,921 --> 02:31:22,940
I'll make sure it,
that way guys will see it and they'll be

3871
02:31:22,941 --> 02:31:27,941
like,
they don't need to know who the fuck I 

3872
02:31:27,941 --> 02:31:29,181
am.
I don't care about me but by the shirt 

3873
02:31:29,181 --> 02:31:29,181
because he liked what it says.
You know,

3874
02:31:29,181 --> 02:31:29,181
I saw way more if I made a trip,
said warm,

3875
02:31:29,181 --> 02:31:30,420
I wouldn't sell it.
Not nearly as much.

3876
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:32,340
I saw hundreds of these.
That's funny.

3877
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:33,720
You know what I mean?
It's a smart move.

3878
02:31:33,721 --> 02:31:35,730
It's a lot of dudes who want to pretend 
to be alpha.

3879
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:36,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

3880
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:39,900
And you know,
and like a body's wanting to do this.

3881
02:31:39,930 --> 02:31:41,460
I want to fight and be able to do these 
shirts.

3882
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:46,700
And me and my,
my navy seal buddies were getting a 

3883
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:46,700
government contract to we're,
we're,

3884
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:47,640
we're,
we're building a whole curriculum dude.

3885
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:51,580
So it's three seals,
me and bruny and we're building a me and

3886
02:31:51,581 --> 02:31:54,630
brittany or putting on navy seal gear 
and we're going to wrestle with it.

3887
02:31:54,631 --> 02:31:59,631
And shit,
we're going to actually the vulnerable 

3888
02:31:59,631 --> 02:31:59,631
brand new curriculum from start to 
finish and we're going to.

3889
02:31:59,631 --> 02:32:04,520
We're getting government contracts to 
train seals and green berets around the 

3890
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:04,520
country.
That's a great idea.

3891
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:05,460
And it's going to be fucking lucrative 
dudes.

3892
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:09,840
Brandon wolfe from you remember him.
He was an ex silly fight.

3893
02:32:09,841 --> 02:32:14,841
The ufc,
he's doing a similar thing on the east 

3894
02:32:14,841 --> 02:32:15,240
coast,
but they did obviously they did it where

3895
02:32:15,870 --> 02:32:20,870
seals method moves and then they had 
brandon since he fought to help them 

3896
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:20,870
teach it.

3897
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:26,270
So we're doing the opposite.
We're going to have us or the shit and 

3898
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:26,270
the event moves and we're going to teach
it,

3899
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:27,420
but it's going to be like it's never 
been done before.

3900
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:30,750
And we already have like my buddy has 
all the government contracts so it could

3901
02:32:30,751 --> 02:32:35,751
be a thing where if it gets big enough,
it can be where we can hire out other 

3902
02:32:35,751 --> 02:32:37,920
fighters that are done fighting because 
a lot of us don't have shit to do.

3903
02:32:37,921 --> 02:32:42,921
Dude.
Like we don't have a backup if you're 

3904
02:32:42,921 --> 02:32:45,310
not.
If you had the champion that you didn't 

3905
02:32:45,310 --> 02:32:46,401
make enough money to have a backup plan.
So if I can make fucking 150 grand a 

3906
02:32:46,401 --> 02:32:50,571
year,
training seals and green berets this 

3907
02:32:50,571 --> 02:32:53,091
hand,
the hand shit and then if it gets too 

3908
02:32:53,091 --> 02:32:53,091
big and we could hire fucking this guy 
and that guy that,

3909
02:32:53,091 --> 02:32:54,360
you know what we've done fighting come 
work for us,

3910
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:56,040
it will be trained in the moves that we 
could do it.

3911
02:32:56,380 --> 02:32:58,210
That's a smart thing to.
Because there's some,

3912
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:03,240
there's some specialists in like unarmed
combat when it comes to removing guns 

3913
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:04,030
from people and removing knives from 
people.

3914
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:07,420
There are some specialists but outside 
of that,

3915
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:10,150
most of their hand to hand combat shit 
is bullshit.

3916
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:11,980
It's not real.
It's not going to work.

3917
02:33:11,981 --> 02:33:13,660
Like I was watching the show the other 
night,

3918
02:33:13,870 --> 02:33:17,110
I was watching the sportsman's network 
at late at night.

3919
02:33:17,111 --> 02:33:19,630
They have like the self defense 
scenarios.

3920
02:33:19,631 --> 02:33:24,631
Like a guy got attacked in an elevator 
and he's controlling this guys arm and 

3921
02:33:24,631 --> 02:33:28,411
then he pulls his gun out and shoots the
guy after he's controlling this guys 

3922
02:33:28,411 --> 02:33:28,411
arm.
And I'm like,

3923
02:33:28,411 --> 02:33:31,980
why is that guy just standing there like
he's not gonna you not gonna control a 

3924
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:32,260
guy's arm like that.
If a guy knows how to fight,

3925
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:34,340
what about his other arm?
You ain't doing shit about this arm.

3926
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,890
You just.
There's so many facts.

3927
02:33:35,970 --> 02:33:37,960
What if he moves?
What if he pulled his arm out?

3928
02:33:38,050 --> 02:33:40,390
What if he kicks you in the dick?
Like there's a lot of shit going on.

3929
02:33:40,391 --> 02:33:45,391
Like what you should know,
and this is what I was on opie and 

3930
02:33:45,391 --> 02:33:48,451
anthony wants to.
They used to have this dude that worked 

3931
02:33:48,451 --> 02:33:49,981
for them was this fake karate guy who 
was talk all this mad stupid shit about 

3932
02:33:49,981 --> 02:33:52,270
you know their sport and then there's 
what works on the street.

3933
02:33:52,271 --> 02:33:54,160
Like no dummy.
This is what works.

3934
02:33:54,190 --> 02:33:57,850
What works with trained killers that 
works on everybody when you,

3935
02:33:57,851 --> 02:34:00,670
when your shit works on anderson silva,
your shit works on everybody.

3936
02:34:00,700 --> 02:34:02,580
What did that.
The thing is like know I've been at,

3937
02:34:02,980 --> 02:34:03,970
I've been trading a long time,
you know,

3938
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:06,770
like a new gal coming.
He's like,

3939
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:12,710
oh my god.
Like right now I could poke your eyes 

3940
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:12,710
out.
I should poke him.

3941
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:15,580
Okay.
You can try to poke them like,

3942
02:34:15,640 --> 02:34:16,270
you know what I mean?
Just try.

3943
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:18,220
Just try and you can't motherfucker.

3944
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:23,400
Because if I'm on the mountain,
you can't reach my eyes and I can read 

3945
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:26,011
yours.
I'll poke your fucking eyes and if you 

3946
02:34:26,011 --> 02:34:26,011
in my garden you can reach my eyes 
either because I'm going to have.

3947
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:28,810
You're not going to get my eyes try 
biting through my calf.

3948
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:29,970
So said that once.
Yeah.

3949
02:34:29,971 --> 02:34:33,730
You don't fight through your calf.
You try to arm bar but you won't hurt.

3950
02:34:33,790 --> 02:34:36,340
That will break your fucking arm.
Can you bite through a steak?

3951
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:39,430
If I gave you a fucking giant ham like 
ham with it?

3952
02:34:39,431 --> 02:34:41,650
It hasn't been cooked yet.
You think you can bite through that.

3953
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:44,580
You could hurt it.
It'll be out cheat.

3954
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:45,430
But in that field,
good.

3955
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:46,510
That's the whole thing is like,
all right,

3956
02:34:46,511 --> 02:34:49,410
well now usually I pokes with youtube 
motherfucker.

3957
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,700
If you can learn how to mountain one 
night can really pull through as good.

3958
02:34:52,780 --> 02:34:54,670
And that's the thing we will street 
fighter like won't work.

3959
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:57,760
Street fighting is all who's willing to 
go farther.

3960
02:34:58,330 --> 02:35:01,000
So like maybe like we're fighting and 
then you know,

3961
02:35:01,001 --> 02:35:06,001
if you want to,
if you want to try to head with me or 

3962
02:35:06,001 --> 02:35:06,001
bite me,
he's asking to scare me.

3963
02:35:06,001 --> 02:35:06,160
I'm disengaged.
Or I'm like,

3964
02:35:06,161 --> 02:35:07,170
oh mother,
motherfucker,

3965
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:08,620
and I'm going to do it too.
You know what I mean?

3966
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:10,440
So it was always like,
who goes through this farther?

3967
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:13,210
You know,
how serious are you willing to get.

3968
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:13,780
You know what I mean?
That's,

3969
02:35:13,820 --> 02:35:15,400
that's.
You remember those felony fights.

3970
02:35:16,570 --> 02:35:18,370
There's one of them where a dude held 
the guy down.

3971
02:35:18,371 --> 02:35:22,120
He was biting his face.
It was so fucked up.

3972
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:25,120
He's holding him down into his scree and
biting his face.

3973
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:30,121
The guy just giant bite marks on his 
face and the guy quit actually do a bit 

3974
02:35:30,121 --> 02:35:30,121
his face.

3975
02:35:30,121 --> 02:35:30,370
He was like,
what the fuck man?

3976
02:35:30,820 --> 02:35:31,360
He's like,
hey,

3977
02:35:31,361 --> 02:35:33,670
didn't say I can't bite your face.
He goes,

3978
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:35,760
how far are you willing to go?
Dude,

3979
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:36,400
go,
yeah.

3980
02:35:36,450 --> 02:35:38,980
You always hear stories about some dude 
in some town,

3981
02:35:38,981 --> 02:35:40,270
a bit,
some dudes nose off.

3982
02:35:40,271 --> 02:35:44,050
You're like,
jesus christ knows off,

3983
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:47,360
but you're right about those guys.
They don't know.

3984
02:35:47,410 --> 02:35:49,600
My friends are seals and they're like,
don't do that.

3985
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:50,870
They said they thought they thought it 
was.

3986
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:55,220
Don't shoot the fuck out of you had a 
hand,

3987
02:35:55,260 --> 02:36:00,260
you know that they don't know shit,
so if we can invent a curriculum that 

3988
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:01,090
it's legit because all,
they're never going to be in a fight,

3989
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:06,360
but if they're going through a hallway 
with a gun and someone don't talk about 

3990
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:09,391
doors grabbed was when the tangled up.
They need to be able to defend 

3991
02:36:09,391 --> 02:36:09,391
themselves.
Ready real quick.

3992
02:36:09,391 --> 02:36:13,140
You need to know how to do that and 
that's something that for the longest 

3993
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,860
time before the ufc came around really 
before nma came around,

3994
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:18,970
people didn't really know what was the 
stuff that worked because how many times

3995
02:36:18,971 --> 02:36:20,440
do you get in a fight in an elevator?

3996
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:25,440
We got to pull your gun so dudes would 
be inventing a bunch of shit that could 

3997
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:28,531
work.
And then from here I'm controlling his 

3998
02:36:28,531 --> 02:36:28,531
arm.
He's,

3999
02:36:28,531 --> 02:36:31,470
he's in my position for me to land up 
devastating elbow and from here he's 

4000
02:36:31,470 --> 02:36:31,690
done.
Like if there's not,

4001
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:36,720
that's why I wasn't hungry.
Once visiting my family and I trained 

4002
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:41,491
them,
I was hungry and I find that good human 

4003
02:36:41,491 --> 02:36:43,011
train and I found another gym and it was
like these fucking japanese akita kind 

4004
02:36:43,011 --> 02:36:46,200
of guy and he was showing me shit like 
for like an hour just twisting it,

4005
02:36:46,210 --> 02:36:48,460
like he was like showing me stuff,
but I'm letting them do it.

4006
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:49,450
I'm like,
fuck it.

4007
02:36:49,451 --> 02:36:54,451
This shit is bad ass.
I'm going to maybe said maybe it does 

4008
02:36:54,451 --> 02:36:54,451
kind of work.
That.

4009
02:36:54,451 --> 02:36:57,340
And we wrestled was fucking never once 
was I ever in anything.

4010
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:00,640
Not one thing I didn't even have to 
defend.

4011
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:03,220
One thing was just it doesn't work.
It doesn't fucking work.

4012
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:05,440
And somebody told me that to quito is 
really effective.

4013
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:07,300
You just have to have a true aikido 
master.

4014
02:37:07,301 --> 02:37:07,630
I'm like,
well,

4015
02:37:07,631 --> 02:37:09,280
get an aikido master to fight in the 
octagon.

4016
02:37:09,281 --> 02:37:11,970
I would love to see it.
I'd love to see a guy just stand there.

4017
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:14,920
Just flip people effortlessly.
Have them sore.

4018
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:16,390
It worked.
Yeah.

4019
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:18,860
Like we're kids.
We watched steven seagal and van damme.

4020
02:37:19,130 --> 02:37:20,540
I wish that shit.
What was the best?

4021
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:21,770
That's the best.
It's fun,

4022
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,790
but it just isn't,
you know.

4023
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:25,770
But that's the most important thing 
about,

4024
02:37:25,970 --> 02:37:30,970
about mixed martial arts is that we know
now more about martial arts than people 

4025
02:37:30,970 --> 02:37:31,670
did 20,
30 years ago.

4026
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:33,590
We just know more for,
for a fact,

4027
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:37,460
we know what's more effective.
Because know back in the old days,

4028
02:37:37,461 --> 02:37:40,040
everyone gets by with like,
they don't have to prove it.

4029
02:37:40,370 --> 02:37:41,270
Had the belt.
That's it.

4030
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:42,250
This is the best,
you know,

4031
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,400
I'm the teacher.
You stand still.

4032
02:37:43,401 --> 02:37:45,830
I'm sure they'll move.
You don't spoil the fucking teacher.

4033
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:46,570
You know,
like,

4034
02:37:46,590 --> 02:37:46,940
like,
you know,

4035
02:37:46,941 --> 02:37:48,150
I met my,
a beer at your sheet.

4036
02:37:48,190 --> 02:37:51,080
Have tried choking me on track and 
trying to get him.

4037
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:53,630
We're fighting all day long.
He's my teacher were fighting.

4038
02:37:54,250 --> 02:37:56,250
No other martial art.
Do you really fired teachers?

4039
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:58,640
Happier teachers.
Sometimes you know,

4040
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:01,550
any bravo goes to town with his 
students.

4041
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:04,820
And I've seen him get tapped by guys by 
black belts are brown belts or what have

4042
02:38:04,821 --> 02:38:09,821
you because he takes chances and it'll 
fight five guys in a row and he's 

4043
02:38:09,821 --> 02:38:09,821
exhausted.
That's what's called training.

4044
02:38:09,821 --> 02:38:10,370
I mean,
that's what it's.

4045
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:11,490
That's what it's about.
Practice.

4046
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:12,870
That's where you want to lose.
Yeah,

4047
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,510
exactly.
And if you're afraid to lose,

4048
02:38:14,511 --> 02:38:17,060
then you're afraid to get better.
If you're afraid to get better,

4049
02:38:17,061 --> 02:38:18,890
you're going to be stagnant and you're 
always going to be.

4050
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:22,220
You're always going to shy away from 
rolling with anybody that can tap you.

4051
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:24,530
There's a difference between people that
don't understand,

4052
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:28,660
that they've never trained before.
If you've never trained before you,

4053
02:38:28,661 --> 02:38:30,680
you'll,
you'll never understand that the correct

4054
02:38:30,681 --> 02:38:35,681
mentality,
the correct mentality is like marcello 

4055
02:38:35,681 --> 02:38:35,681
garcia,
like has the best statement about that.

4056
02:38:35,681 --> 02:38:37,340
It's like you have to open up your game 
in the gym.

4057
02:38:37,341 --> 02:38:40,310
That's the only way to get better 
because you have to worry about,

4058
02:38:40,311 --> 02:38:45,311
you know,
you have to give yourself the potential 

4059
02:38:45,311 --> 02:38:45,311
to get tapped.
Don't,

4060
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:46,520
you're not going to be able to type of 
guy.

4061
02:38:46,730 --> 02:38:48,620
But if you do,
you figure just tap,

4062
02:38:48,621 --> 02:38:50,820
just tap and move on.
That's like barrett,

4063
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,190
barrett,
small,

4064
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:54,610
just fucking 35.
He's a bad motherfucker though.

4065
02:38:55,060 --> 02:38:58,690
And he's a maniac.
Barrett is a fucking dick.

4066
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:01,410
The personality to the core,
his drug is introduced.

4067
02:39:02,090 --> 02:39:03,520
I mean,
he's in there three,

4068
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:04,750
four times a day,
all day long.

4069
02:39:04,750 --> 02:39:06,000
He's a maniac.
He,

4070
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:08,690
he gets hurt.
You'll tapers out onto himself and still

4071
02:39:08,730 --> 02:39:10,330
really,
he's a maniac with barrett.

4072
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:11,120
Take a day off.
He won't.

4073
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:13,950
He'll blindfold ourselves sometimes in 
rural.

4074
02:39:14,210 --> 02:39:16,280
Wow.
He just uses a maniac.

4075
02:39:16,281 --> 02:39:17,430
He's a maniac.
And uh,

4076
02:39:17,890 --> 02:39:20,740
he always wants to put himself and make 
it harder for them,

4077
02:39:20,741 --> 02:39:23,450
you know?
And he's little and he's like,

4078
02:39:23,451 --> 02:39:24,210
fuck,
he's so small.

4079
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:29,240
We can just get them.
But you can't because he's a super 

4080
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:29,240
technical though.
He's really fun to watch too,

4081
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:30,110
you know,
she does a good guy to learn from my bed

4082
02:39:30,111 --> 02:39:30,830
to.
Oh yeah.

4083
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,870
And he's,
he's like one of the most humble guys.

4084
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:37,090
He'll see a white belt,
like do something weird.

4085
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:37,420
Like,
hey,

4086
02:39:37,560 --> 02:39:39,170
what the fuck?
What did you just do?

4087
02:39:39,171 --> 02:39:40,760
Like,
it wasn't a move,

4088
02:39:40,761 --> 02:39:42,290
but at the bears then it'd be better 
with like,

4089
02:39:42,470 --> 02:39:44,530
he doesn't care if he's learned to 
brandon.

4090
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:47,330
We've invented yourself and your,
your first day he'll try it.

4091
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:49,250
He don't care.
He has no ego at all.

4092
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:52,730
That smart guys experience.
Well that's a good attitude man.

4093
02:39:52,731 --> 02:39:57,731
Because you remember there was like a 
big resistance to a lot of the 

4094
02:39:57,731 --> 02:39:57,731
traditional guys with a lot of new 
stuff.

4095
02:39:57,731 --> 02:39:58,550
Was coming along,
a lot of guys were saying,

4096
02:39:58,551 --> 02:40:00,470
you don't need it.
All you need is just straight.

4097
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:05,700
Great jokes,
but there was so many new moves and 

4098
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:09,761
people were like dark jokes and all this
shit that people didn't accept for a 

4099
02:40:09,761 --> 02:40:09,761
while.
Yeah,

4100
02:40:09,761 --> 02:40:09,770
yeah,
yeah.

4101
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:12,510
You do japanese neck ties.
You have to do japanese neck times.

4102
02:40:13,130 --> 02:40:18,130
It's when you can't get the doors.
If you can't go all the way through and 

4103
02:40:18,130 --> 02:40:21,111
get the doors,
you get it and he's cinch up here and 

4104
02:40:21,111 --> 02:40:23,280
you tuck the guy's head into your chest.
You roll over them this way and you hook

4105
02:40:23,281 --> 02:40:24,070
a leg and crank.

4106
02:40:24,070 --> 02:40:26,630
It is a nasty neck crack.
It's obviously not london.

4107
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:31,180
Bravo's really good at that.
The japanese japanese neck tying guess.

4108
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:32,430
Yeah,
peruvian necktie,

4109
02:40:32,431 --> 02:40:34,350
japanese net cranked,
whatever it's called.

4110
02:40:34,351 --> 02:40:37,320
It's a nasty move.
Instead of completing the doors,

4111
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:40,170
instead of getting it all the way and 
sinking sensation it like this.

4112
02:40:40,280 --> 02:40:42,040
Sometimes it's hard to get all the way.
Yeah,

4113
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:43,100
sometimes.
Yeah.

4114
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:44,580
With long arms.
Guys.

4115
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:47,760
How'd you.
How those little t rex arms,

4116
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,120
but guys like roger gracie,
you know they have that advantage.

4117
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:53,370
Damien maia want 70,
you know,

4118
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:58,400
he's got a good long frame at one 70.
He's an interesting guy at one 70 

4119
02:40:58,970 --> 02:41:00,380
[inaudible].
There was a guy that like,

4120
02:41:00,580 --> 02:41:02,630
I never thought he was gonna be able to 
cut that weight.

4121
02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:05,760
Like that's a,
that's a big dude for 170 pounds.

4122
02:41:06,270 --> 02:41:09,380
He guys like Nathan Moore court tool.
I couldn't live with Kuwait.

4123
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:15,020
He apparently was walking around and 
like one 85 when he was fighting at one 

4124
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:15,020
85 or was.

4125
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:17,160
He looks so big.
I never seen him personally,

4126
02:41:17,161 --> 02:41:19,180
but he looks huge while he's muscular,
you know.

4127
02:41:19,230 --> 02:41:22,260
But apparently he never really cut much 
weight at all and fought at one 85.

4128
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:24,090
That dude,
they,

4129
02:41:24,091 --> 02:41:29,091
you know,
there's people to talk about him from 

4130
02:41:29,091 --> 02:41:31,090
the time when he was coming up and enter
into the ufc about how fucking good he 

4131
02:41:32,101 --> 02:41:37,101
was before he got into the ufc back when
he was fighting in strikeforce or buy 

4132
02:41:37,101 --> 02:41:39,720
back even before then that uh,
he was always sparring with like big,

4133
02:41:39,721 --> 02:41:42,950
big heavy guys though.
Like he would spar with shane carwyn and

4134
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:48,000
they came up at the same gym.
So he'd be in there guy fighting at one 

4135
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,090
70,
one 85 flight and shane fucking car when

4136
02:41:49,091 --> 02:41:52,590
it to 65 and they'd be going to war with
each other on a regular basis.

4137
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:54,430
I've been a fight like the waterways.

4138
02:41:54,450 --> 02:41:55,320
Nothing.
Yeah,

4139
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:58,610
you're going to hit me.
I get hit by a car when everyday and not

4140
02:41:58,870 --> 02:42:03,450
that they mean he's also taking those 
shots and like a guys who know him think

4141
02:42:03,451 --> 02:42:06,660
that probably contributed to his demise 
all chin.

4142
02:42:06,830 --> 02:42:07,970
He was it.
Yeah.

4143
02:42:08,010 --> 02:42:10,640
Because you know those dudes that trevor
whitman's dudes,

4144
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:12,410
you can't spar with them.
Big guys.

4145
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:14,790
I mean like unless they're really,
really controlled.

4146
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:16,260
But even like,
um,

4147
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:21,960
I was probably like ray sefo and like a 
couple of guys that could towards that 

4148
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:23,250
are big,
but they're going soft.

4149
02:42:23,251 --> 02:42:24,840
But even though I'm going soft dude it 
fucking,

4150
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:26,580
they hit you.
You know what I mean?

4151
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:31,320
They checked your kik for knees or even 
like needs like that wire they kick.

4152
02:42:31,321 --> 02:42:33,270
You know what I mean?
Even even,

4153
02:42:33,330 --> 02:42:37,960
even a soft heavyweight keeps you in the
leg soft and it lands that weight.

4154
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:40,800
It's still heavy and it still hurt your 
leg more than any wall to where ever,

4155
02:42:40,801 --> 02:42:43,380
you know,
I stay away from the heavyweights unless

4156
02:42:43,381 --> 02:42:44,430
they're super,
super controlled.

4157
02:42:44,670 --> 02:42:45,540
Yeah,
that's smart.

4158
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:50,690
That's how it all you guys get back.
Injuries to rolling with heavy weights 

4159
02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:51,570
to get twisted up and gets sprawled on 
rehab.

4160
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:56,600
One time I fucking shot on gabriel.
Gonzaga squash me like a book.

4161
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:59,540
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

4162
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:04,560
piece huge and moves good.
And he's a giant dick guy when he walks 

4163
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,720
onto the scale when gonzaga is different
than anybody else in the ufc.

4164
02:43:06,721 --> 02:43:11,721
When he gets on the platform,
you feel like the weight of just his.

4165
02:43:13,090 --> 02:43:14,980
He's like dense,
like stone,

4166
02:43:14,981 --> 02:43:18,730
like he's mad stone,
but he's a dude that trains all the time

4167
02:43:18,731 --> 02:43:20,260
and ludlow,
Massachusetts.

4168
02:43:20,261 --> 02:43:22,240
He's not treating them like real good 
guys out there.

4169
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:24,430
You know,
he's got massive potential.

4170
02:43:24,460 --> 02:43:27,340
I mean jujitsu world champion,
bad ass jujitsu,

4171
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:30,640
knockout power.
But he's like a step behind the,

4172
02:43:30,641 --> 02:43:34,330
the really the very best guys as I felt 
that,

4173
02:43:34,331 --> 02:43:35,980
that the last thing on the uc did about 
them.

4174
02:43:37,720 --> 02:43:39,160
They followed them around.
But it's cool though,

4175
02:43:39,161 --> 02:43:40,060
you know,
you see his,

4176
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:43,000
his life there is really good.
Obviously it's got a nice gym.

4177
02:43:43,001 --> 02:43:44,410
The people love him,
you know,

4178
02:43:44,530 --> 02:43:47,420
he's a great jujitsu coach too.
He's a nice guy and he's very,

4179
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:48,600
very nice guy.
I remember,

4180
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:51,310
I remember one time I was at wec wins.
He came up to me.

4181
02:43:51,311 --> 02:43:52,850
He's like,
hey man was.

4182
02:43:53,150 --> 02:43:54,730
It was close after I filed j rock.
He was like,

4183
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,170
that was a good fight.
And I was like,

4184
02:43:57,010 --> 02:43:57,670
fuck.
That was awesome.

4185
02:43:57,730 --> 02:43:58,740
Like I was like,
you mother fucker,

4186
02:43:58,750 --> 02:44:01,270
you if I was good with crooked when you.
That was crazy.

4187
02:44:01,271 --> 02:44:06,271
I mean like,
but it was to have them say that it was 

4188
02:44:06,271 --> 02:44:06,271
maybe not all of them.
Like,

4189
02:44:06,271 --> 02:44:06,271
oh,
I love him now.

4190
02:44:06,271 --> 02:44:08,170
He's a very nice night.
His knock out cro.

4191
02:44:08,171 --> 02:44:13,171
Cop was the all time greatest head kick 
knock out ever was plus because like it 

4192
02:44:13,171 --> 02:44:13,240
was a little.

4193
02:44:13,550 --> 02:44:16,660
How is he going to win the last one?
all the lists of lists.

4194
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:17,850
His head kick.
Yeah,

4195
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:19,370
that's croak.
I was fucking move.

4196
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:20,060
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

4197
02:44:20,061 --> 02:44:21,850
Like you're never going to invent guests
that move.

4198
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:25,630
He had kicked the guy who's responsible 
for more head kick,

4199
02:44:25,720 --> 02:44:28,990
highlight reel knockout than anybody.
like when you watch a cro,

4200
02:44:28,991 --> 02:44:33,280
cop and pride career was head kicked in.
What happened to him?

4201
02:44:33,430 --> 02:44:36,280
Why do you not do good in the ufc?
Did a lot of questions.

4202
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,960
Juice could be that.
Could it be juice?

4203
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:41,110
Could be punishment.
Maybe the amount of punishments.

4204
02:44:41,111 --> 02:44:45,070
Body took all those fights or fate or 
the fights with nogueira fights with.

4205
02:44:45,071 --> 02:44:50,071
I mean think about how many guys who 
fought took a lot of fucking hard hard 

4206
02:44:50,071 --> 02:44:53,191
fights because it was scary.
He was a monster in his first fight in 

4207
02:44:53,191 --> 02:44:53,191
ufc.
Eddie sanchez,

4208
02:44:53,191 --> 02:44:53,350
right?

4209
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:55,840
Yeah.
And like theY told eddie,

4210
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:01,000
eddie eddie knew was going to lose.
We didn't even like you didn't do shit 

4211
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:01,060
that he really,
you know what I mean?

4212
02:45:01,090 --> 02:45:06,090
Not much.
He definitely didn't look like the same 

4213
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:06,090
cro cop.
He never did ever say,

4214
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:07,090
but it could just be that it was the end
of the run.

4215
02:45:07,091 --> 02:45:07,960
you know what I mean?
Guys,

4216
02:45:07,961 --> 02:45:10,120
just they can only keep it up for so 
long.

4217
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:13,330
Like you want to keep it up for so long,
you know,

4218
02:45:13,331 --> 02:45:14,260
he was a great,
great,

4219
02:45:14,261 --> 02:45:19,261
great fighter.
When he won the pried open wait grand 

4220
02:45:19,261 --> 02:45:21,331
prix man,
he was a motherfucker back then when he 

4221
02:45:21,331 --> 02:45:23,221
knocked out vandelay,
the cro cop that knocked out vandelay 

4222
02:45:23,221 --> 02:45:24,130
was one of the baddest motherfuckers 
ever because he had like,

4223
02:45:24,370 --> 02:45:29,370
he first fought vandelay.
He didn't know shit about the ground 

4224
02:45:29,370 --> 02:45:30,250
game and they had like a weird first.
The first fight was like weird rules,

4225
02:45:30,251 --> 02:45:33,910
like they only go to the ground for like
30 seconds or something like tide family

4226
02:45:33,911 --> 02:45:38,911
up and hang out with,
hang on but wouldn't even be standing 

4227
02:45:38,911 --> 02:45:38,911
up.

4228
02:45:38,911 --> 02:45:42,150
He didn't.
It wasn't free to uncork shots because 

4229
02:45:42,150 --> 02:45:42,150
he was still worried about the 
wrestling.

4230
02:45:42,150 --> 02:45:45,130
But the second fight he had his take 
down defense down.

4231
02:45:45,131 --> 02:45:48,520
He had a good spa at the end and he lit 
vandelay up like a christmas tree.

4232
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:51,790
That was one of the best,
the best performances of his career.

4233
02:45:51,791 --> 02:45:54,490
It's the second fight with vandelay,
but yeah man,

4234
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:56,080
who knows.
I mean every fighter,

4235
02:45:56,610 --> 02:45:59,020
they got a window.
You got a window of time where you could

4236
02:45:59,021 --> 02:46:00,730
perform at that level,
you know,

4237
02:46:00,731 --> 02:46:03,070
and when you're 37,
38,

4238
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:08,100
39,
it's just slowly winding down and then 

4239
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:09,410
that's it.
There's not much left after that.

4240
02:46:09,940 --> 02:46:10,030
You

4241
02:46:10,030 --> 02:46:15,030
know,
these guys that did perform at that 

4242
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:16,020
super high level was vandelay and pride.
I think about that.

4243
02:46:16,170 --> 02:46:17,550
Vandelay was never the same.
Vandelay

4244
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:19,370
no was easy.
We,

4245
02:46:19,480 --> 02:46:20,160
yeah,
he was still.

4246
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:24,100
He was still pretty good though.
Pretty good pride.

4247
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:24,740
It was crazy.

4248
02:46:25,210 --> 02:46:26,530
Well,
he was dominant and pride.

4249
02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:28,930
that's the difference.
He's still wild in the ufc.

4250
02:46:28,931 --> 02:46:30,340
like he's still beat kyung lee.
Yeah.

4251
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:32,700
But then he gets knocked out by leaving,
you knoW,

4252
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:35,140
it was weird.
Fucked up.

4253
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:40,260
Each tried to go to war with leaving.
You can't stay in the pocket believe 

4254
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:40,560
because he can take it,
leave and can take it any.

4255
02:46:40,660 --> 02:46:44,710
The motherfucker hits hard.
Chris [inaudible] left hand is a,

4256
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:49,720
a battering ram and motherfuckers got a 
real hard lefthand is a matter of him 

4257
02:46:49,720 --> 02:46:51,060
being able to hit you like uriah hall 
fight.

4258
02:46:51,061 --> 02:46:53,410
He just couldn't catch.
Hall hall was just too good,

4259
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:55,330
but vandelay went chin to chin with 
them.

4260
02:46:55,780 --> 02:46:56,650
Well,
theY're the same style.

4261
02:46:56,651 --> 02:46:58,130
That why is.
Yeah,

4262
02:46:58,580 --> 02:47:03,580
but you know,
like vandelay is still like the brian 

4263
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:06,781
stann fight was a great fight.
Still capable of putting on great 

4264
02:47:06,781 --> 02:47:10,291
fights.
It's just not the same vandelays the 

4265
02:47:10,291 --> 02:47:10,291
vandelia beat like,
like,

4266
02:47:10,291 --> 02:47:15,270
or like I'm quinten jackson or the 
vandelay that beat sakuraba or the 

4267
02:47:15,270 --> 02:47:19,351
vandelay,
the beat henderson the first fight and 

4268
02:47:19,351 --> 02:47:19,351
he was a destroyer.
He was a scary fucker.

4269
02:47:19,351 --> 02:47:24,310
it was.
But it might've been a little bit help 

4270
02:47:24,310 --> 02:47:24,310
there.
Might have heard a little bit.

4271
02:47:24,310 --> 02:47:24,900
They had to.
They all know they do,

4272
02:47:24,901 --> 02:47:28,410
but I know they do it,
but it's like what happened?

4273
02:47:28,411 --> 02:47:30,090
What I think happens is that some 
fighters,

4274
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:35,160
if your first fight is on juice,
then you mentally are dependent on it.

4275
02:47:35,410 --> 02:47:40,410
Yeah.
I think the guys that can't perform 

4276
02:47:40,410 --> 02:47:42,000
without are those ones that they always 
had it,

4277
02:47:42,390 --> 02:47:45,530
but I think the guys that fight a lot of
times without it and then having,

4278
02:47:45,531 --> 02:47:47,370
having and then have,
they can do either way.

4279
02:47:47,371 --> 02:47:52,371
You know,
some guys that they've done it from day 

4280
02:47:52,371 --> 02:47:52,371
one,
then they rely on the juice.

4281
02:47:52,371 --> 02:47:52,371
You know what I mean?

4282
02:47:52,371 --> 02:47:53,230
Well,
we only have a couple minutes left,

4283
02:47:53,231 --> 02:47:58,231
but I want to ask you one thing about,
because this is like the hot topic now 

4284
02:47:58,231 --> 02:48:01,171
in mma is testosterone replacement.
These guys that are like 29 years old 

4285
02:48:01,171 --> 02:48:06,031
and replacing that testosterone and 
there's a real issue now because 

4286
02:48:06,031 --> 02:48:06,820
vittorio is going to fight chris 
weidman,

4287
02:48:06,890 --> 02:48:11,890
they're going to fight in the United 
States and they're going to fight in 

4288
02:48:11,890 --> 02:48:14,251
vegas,
which is a really hard place to get a 

4289
02:48:14,251 --> 02:48:16,291
testosterone exemption,
especially if you tested positive for 

4290
02:48:16,291 --> 02:48:17,290
juice,
which tour has in the past,

4291
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:20,920
so he might not get a testosterone use 
exemption,

4292
02:48:20,921 --> 02:48:25,921
which is fucking crazy because he's been
fighting at this insane level for the 

4293
02:48:26,440 --> 02:48:27,550
last year.
The bisping fight.

4294
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:30,160
Luke rockhold fight the last.
Dan henderson fight me.

4295
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:35,200
It looks like a fucking demon.
I mean The new veto on testosterone 

4296
02:48:35,200 --> 02:48:39,001
replacement looks like a fucking demon,
but what is gonna happen to him if he 

4297
02:48:39,001 --> 02:48:39,700
asked to get off of it,
the fight weinman.

4298
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:44,830
See,
here's the thing with testosterone and 

4299
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:46,900
steroids is that,
so say that guy abused it when he was 

4300
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:49,581
young,
which be to probably dig back in the 

4301
02:48:49,581 --> 02:48:51,710
day.
I think for sure too long when you're 

4302
02:48:51,710 --> 02:48:51,710
young.
Well guess what?

4303
02:48:51,710 --> 02:48:52,530
You never came off.
He never fucking did a right.

4304
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,660
Your balls turn off and they'll turn 
back on.

4305
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:58,860
So now he may be young but his balls 
don't work.

4306
02:48:59,010 --> 02:49:01,800
So he now he needs this therapy for 
really,

4307
02:49:01,801 --> 02:49:03,810
really does.
So if you don't let them have it,

4308
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:06,840
you're hurting him.
But at the same time other guys,

4309
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:07,950
maybe they just

4310
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:13,040
do because they want to juice.
So then they get a bullshit doctor to 

4311
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:13,040
say,
hey man,

4312
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:13,040
you're a fan.
Give me,

4313
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:13,140
give me this prescription.
You know,

4314
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:15,470
so it's a fucked up thing.
I don't know like,

4315
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:18,250
but in the end of the day,
like if a doctor prescribes it,

4316
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:19,920
dr has a lot,
is supposed to have.

4317
02:49:19,921 --> 02:49:21,990
The last rule was a doctor.
So you know,

4318
02:49:23,560 --> 02:49:24,540
doctors are,
you know,

4319
02:49:24,541 --> 02:49:27,660
they're supposed to be infallible and 
like honest and stuff and you know,

4320
02:49:27,661 --> 02:49:30,720
we all know that no one is,
but some guys need a man because some of

4321
02:49:30,721 --> 02:49:35,721
the guys that they abuse steroids and 
are younger and now they have to have 

4322
02:49:35,721 --> 02:49:35,721
it.
Yeah.

4323
02:49:35,721 --> 02:49:37,620
But their argument is that those guys 
shouldn't be allowed to fight because in

4324
02:49:37,621 --> 02:49:42,621
doing so,
your natural hormone levels drop during 

4325
02:49:42,621 --> 02:49:43,260
training camp because you train hard and
you breaking down your body.

4326
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:45,120
It's natural for your hormone levels to 
drop.

4327
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:50,120
But these guys are,
their hormone levels are not dropping 

4328
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:50,120
because they're keeping them at a 
consistent level.

4329
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:53,160
If they have to take twice the amount of
an unnatural testosterone in order to do

4330
02:49:53,161 --> 02:49:54,630
that,
they're still doing that.

4331
02:49:54,750 --> 02:49:57,570
And so they have an unfair advantage and
training camp by taking that.

4332
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,960
And I think that's a good argument man.
It's a good argument.

4333
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:04,860
It's tough.
But I think every sport juices period,

4334
02:50:05,730 --> 02:50:08,100
a lot of them do every sport,
you know,

4335
02:50:08,101 --> 02:50:10,280
and not every guy there,
he's probably every sport dude's juicing

4336
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:10,940
football,
baseball.

4337
02:50:10,941 --> 02:50:15,941
He give a shit what works exactly.
And people are always going to try to 

4338
02:50:15,941 --> 02:50:16,620
find a way to juice and cheap.
So you know what I mean?

4339
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:20,340
It's just a fascinating situation when 
you've got veto who's streaking,

4340
02:50:20,550 --> 02:50:25,550
who's looked better than ever,
but now he's going to have to fight 

4341
02:50:25,550 --> 02:50:28,071
weidman.
He might not get a testosterone use 

4342
02:50:28,071 --> 02:50:28,071
exemption.

4343
02:50:28,071 --> 02:50:28,110
Kids real weird,
right?

4344
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:29,510
Yeah.
It's like a.

4345
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:32,370
I don't know.
You can't say yes.

4346
02:50:32,371 --> 02:50:33,720
The one that probably didn't know that 
next fight.

4347
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:35,730
That's why it's not fair either.
Got to say.

4348
02:50:35,731 --> 02:50:37,110
All right man,
if you're on the sheet,

4349
02:50:37,111 --> 02:50:38,430
you guys can't fight no more.
Well,

4350
02:50:38,431 --> 02:50:41,030
he's only been fighting in Brazil.
That's the craziest way.

4351
02:50:41,270 --> 02:50:42,810
It's been fighting in Brazil for the 
last.

4352
02:50:42,811 --> 02:50:43,800
Like in Brazil,
the.

4353
02:50:43,810 --> 02:50:48,810
They'll let him fight on pcp.
We will get a new pcp prescription for 

4354
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:50,250
vito.
Yeah.

4355
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:51,210
I don't know man.
He's a.

4356
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:53,850
He's a fucking hero over there.
But yeah,

4357
02:50:53,851 --> 02:50:56,040
that's a.
That's a tough subject then.

4358
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:59,100
It is a tough subject because I would 
like to see him at this level,

4359
02:50:59,101 --> 02:51:00,450
the level that he fought.
Dan henderson.

4360
02:51:00,451 --> 02:51:05,451
I would like to see him fight weidman 
and it might very well be that the only 

4361
02:51:05,451 --> 02:51:05,670
way he could reach that level is on trt.

4362
02:51:05,670 --> 02:51:07,950
So I dunno.
It's going to stop testing.

4363
02:51:07,970 --> 02:51:09,860
Fuck it.
But you take lexapro,

4364
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:12,030
take lexapro.
And you'd take lexapro.

4365
02:51:12,031 --> 02:51:13,830
Why you fighting all throughout your 
camp?

4366
02:51:13,860 --> 02:51:18,860
Oh yeah.
Well now if they said that there's an 

4367
02:51:18,860 --> 02:51:19,290
advantage that you don't get anxiety 
where everybody else is freaking out and

4368
02:51:19,291 --> 02:51:20,940
they all get anxiety.
Do you think,

4369
02:51:21,010 --> 02:51:24,230
do you think there's anything to that?
Um,

4370
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:27,050
I still get anxiety,
but I mean everyone before the fights.

4371
02:51:27,070 --> 02:51:27,890
Nervous.
Right?

4372
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:30,390
Because you want control your nerves in 
some way.

4373
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:33,270
Yeah.
Well here's the thing,

4374
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:37,720
I still get nervous,
but before I was way more interesting,

4375
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:39,400
I should have been because I had,
I had a,

4376
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:43,680
I have anxiety and panic attacks so it 
manages my nervousness to where I should

4377
02:51:43,681 --> 02:51:48,681
be.
I'm a normal nervous instead of a 

4378
02:51:48,681 --> 02:51:50,231
retarded nervous,
you know what I mean by not back there 

4379
02:51:50,231 --> 02:51:50,231
like this.
Like totally like,

4380
02:51:50,231 --> 02:51:51,990
you know what I mean?
It's still nervous like any other fight,

4381
02:51:51,991 --> 02:51:54,780
but not like I was before my medication,
you know,

4382
02:51:54,781 --> 02:51:56,610
it doesn't make you tailspin.
No.

4383
02:51:56,970 --> 02:51:59,330
But in saying tHat most of fighting is 
mental,

4384
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:04,340
big part of it is mental.
Isn't that an advantage to take 

4385
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:04,340
something like that?

4386
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:09,100
Uh,
for,

4387
02:52:09,130 --> 02:52:10,930
for example,
if I said that they said I can't take it

4388
02:52:10,931 --> 02:52:15,931
no more,
it was thought it would fit with me 

4389
02:52:15,931 --> 02:52:15,931
because I've been,
I've been relying on it,

4390
02:52:15,931 --> 02:52:16,870
you know,
I,

4391
02:52:17,180 --> 02:52:18,460
I would not,
not for fighting.

4392
02:52:18,461 --> 02:52:20,410
I rely on it for life,
you know what I mean?

4393
02:52:20,411 --> 02:52:22,870
So it would fit me a lot for me,
you know what I mean?

4394
02:52:22,871 --> 02:52:23,350
But,
uh,

4395
02:52:24,090 --> 02:52:26,020
I don't,
I'm not sure what it would do too.

4396
02:52:26,110 --> 02:52:27,580
If you're a normal person and he took 
it.

4397
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:30,190
I'm not sure how it would,
how it would affect you,

4398
02:52:30,191 --> 02:52:35,191
you know,
I don't know if it would help you 

4399
02:52:35,191 --> 02:52:35,191
nervous before the fight or not.
I don't,

4400
02:52:35,191 --> 02:52:35,191
I don't know how that would work.
see,

4401
02:52:35,191 --> 02:52:38,580
because it's an interesting argument 
because on one hand I want you to take 

4402
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:40,620
it because I think that if it benefits 
you as a person and is a,

4403
02:52:40,630 --> 02:52:45,630
is a drug that someone invented that has
a positive effect on your life and it 

4404
02:52:45,630 --> 02:52:46,840
makes your life better,
then of course you should be on it.

4405
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:52,100
I mean That's a good thing.
It's a good thing for some if something 

4406
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:54,541
comes along and gives you less anxiety 
and you feel good and you're still 

4407
02:52:54,541 --> 02:52:54,541
living a healthy life,
that's a good thing.

4408
02:52:54,541 --> 02:52:57,280
That's a positive thing.
But when it comes to performance,

4409
02:52:57,281 --> 02:52:59,620
like there's certain things like I know 
the uh,

4410
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:00,640
you know,
like adderall,

4411
02:53:00,641 --> 02:53:05,641
like fighters aren't allowed to fight on
adderall and some guys have 

4412
02:53:05,641 --> 02:53:05,641
prescriptions for adderall.
Yeah.

4413
02:53:05,641 --> 02:53:06,470
But adderall.
Adderall is just speed.

4414
02:53:06,610 --> 02:53:11,610
The speed.
I mean look at the generic it was sold 

4415
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:11,610
but,
but for add guys,

4416
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:13,930
is there any benefit to it?
Does it actually help them?

4417
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:16,150
And it helps you study.
Add,

4418
02:53:16,520 --> 02:53:19,390
say you add real bad and you just can't 
concentrate your spouse.

4419
02:53:19,420 --> 02:53:21,730
You can't read the book.
It will help you study,

4420
02:53:22,060 --> 02:53:24,190
you know what I mean?
But dudes,

4421
02:53:24,230 --> 02:53:26,320
they're fucking have a prescription for 
adderall that aren't in school,

4422
02:53:26,321 --> 02:53:27,010
are full of shit.

4423
02:53:27,650 --> 02:53:28,450
You know what I mean?
I mean,

4424
02:53:28,790 --> 02:53:31,540
it is not a real doctor will tell you.
It is not a real fucking thing.

4425
02:53:31,541 --> 02:53:32,320
It's speed,
dude.

4426
02:53:32,910 --> 02:53:35,960
It giving you energy and you don't have 
energy because of what happened.

4427
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:41,020
So like guys,
I think that have adult prescriptions 

4428
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:41,440
that did fight mma.
It's because they do the train the train

4429
02:53:41,441 --> 02:53:46,441
harder than you're fucking jacked up.
Hitler invented or does not just affect 

4430
02:53:46,441 --> 02:53:50,500
to meth or to make their soldiers 
marched better and longer and unless 

4431
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:53,230
food.
So if You could be hopped up on that all

4432
02:53:53,230 --> 02:53:54,010
day long and train,
you know,

4433
02:53:54,011 --> 02:53:54,910
it'd probably be good.
You know,

4434
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:56,060
it's,
it's,

4435
02:53:56,070 --> 02:53:59,410
it's interesting man.
I think that adderall is a weird one.

4436
02:53:59,411 --> 02:54:04,411
I've never done it.
But the people that do do it saY it's 

4437
02:54:04,411 --> 02:54:04,411
fucking awesome for a bunch of different
shifts will snort it.

4438
02:54:04,411 --> 02:54:04,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

4439
02:54:04,990 --> 02:54:07,150
I mean chicks,
it's basically like,

4440
02:54:07,450 --> 02:54:08,110
it's like,
uh,

4441
02:54:08,350 --> 02:54:10,090
you're too proud to do meth.

4442
02:54:10,890 --> 02:54:13,000
You know what I mean?
Like that's drugs.

4443
02:54:13,001 --> 02:54:14,590
My doctor gives me this.
Oh yeah,

4444
02:54:14,591 --> 02:54:16,120
the doctor told you snort it,
motherfucker.

4445
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:17,990
Talk to snort it.
You know what I mean?

4446
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:19,240
Exactly.
