1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
All right,
let me just have this dense thick heel 

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,110
scan that curls over on each side like a
human flip flop.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,840
You could hide a q tip from where the,
the ankles,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,290
the calves go into the ankle if you can 
just tuck one in there and not even see 

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,400
it.
We were talking about that too.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,000
The thing that you least have a sympathy
for someone who's overweight.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,200
You know,
I,

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,050
I sympathize with people who have 
glandular problems,

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,150
but if you're just a fat fuck,
glutton ising all day,

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,240
uh,
if you're a fucking faggot shit,

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,760
say that again.
Have you ever fucked a fat chick?

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,090
I'm going to give you a second chance.
I'm sure.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,100
Sure.
I blocked it out.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,290
No,
that actually is a little bit like,

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,810
hey,
it's more chick and it actually,

16
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,811
you know,
you get sweaty ingredients like you're 

17
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:51,390
fucking more woman.
And I kind of enjoyed it was different.

18
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:53,310
Do you feel more comfortable with your 
body too?

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,030
Because you look,
listen,

20
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,550
bitch,
you know,

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,270
you're,
you know,

22
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,530
I didn't think of it that way.
It was kind of like,

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,560
oh,
there's skin and boobs everywhere and 

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,991
ass everywhere.
You ever feel uncomfortable about any 

25
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:06,930
one of these folds in her stomach?
It was just weird,

26
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:10,470
like I don't want to do it again,
but it was definitely interesting.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,600
Who was it that told us that only fucks 
with a shirt on?

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,640
Was it already?
Probably Duncan.

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,270
I don't remember.
Whatever.

30
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,750
I guess if you were,
if you were banging.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,740
I don't think it's all right.
I think.

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,900
I think I'm incorrect.
If you're banging,

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,030
it might've been Louie ck.

34
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,310
Oh,
that I can see that now.

35
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,510
I think he actually has a bid on it 
actually.

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,070
I'm pretty sure that's it.
Yeah,

37
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,040
I think Louis has a bid on it.
Um,

38
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,090
you know,
if you're,

39
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:39,250
if you're fucking offend,
check like you can like loosen up,

40
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,610
you know,
if you're banging like some super hot 

41
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,460
alpha female with perfect shape.
Like why is she even lend me?

42
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:46,960
Fuck her.
This is ridiculous.

43
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,640
Like I'm not even worthy.
But if it's a faculty like bitching,

44
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,030
good as you can make fun of.
Yeah.

45
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,980
There's definitely.
I mean,

46
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,250
in culturally,
you know,

47
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,680
there's some,
there's some cultures that still,

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,890
there's a lot of dudes who like,
I'm fat that like I have a friend who 

49
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,390
likes girls and he always jokes around 
Sam Aaa.

50
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,290
He jokes about it,
he likes them thick,

51
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,430
he likes something.
He goes,

52
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:11,770
I like a thick girl.
It was just like say it out loud,

53
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,990
like a big,
like a big ass,

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,180
you know.
And he's hilarious about it.

55
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,080
That's what he likes,
man.

56
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,350
That's his type of woman always has been
and he's not faking it.

57
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:21,960
That's what he likes,
you know,

58
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,960
everybody's got their own thing.
So that's a,

59
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:29,961
that's a fucking a weird thing.
Like when someone's got a little little 

60
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:33,600
twist,
a little twist and what they're 

61
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,270
attracted to go to fucking look a long 
foot,

62
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,320
big foot,
don't want a wide foot.

63
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,980
But I look a girl with the long foot.
Yeah,

64
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:40,160
yeah.
I

65
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,670
have friends who will look at a girl's 
feet almost first and they'll be like,

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,690
oh no,
no,

67
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,280
look at her.
She's got like a size 10,

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,250
you know,
and they'll just be out.

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,690
So the big theater bat or like weird 
toes,

70
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,890
like with week chins and weak eyebrows.
If a girl is a weak chin or a week 

71
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,860
either.
Really Small Chins are disturbing.

72
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,430
Disturbing.

73
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't like it.
There's something.

74
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:06,841
Something wrong with you genetically.
Like if you're really missing a check 

75
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:07,360
because he reminds me of like a frog or 
something.

76
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,390
It's odd.
It's an oddity like why is your lower 

77
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
jaw so small or do you not have to chew 
things?

78
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,010
The more evolved than me.
Are you in the next stage where we're 

79
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,690
gonna be eating liquid fruit,

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,830
blow that out and do a bubble and make a
nice song from your mouth.

81
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,010
What is that?
Is that evolution?

82
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,540
And they more evolved than us.

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,690
I don't know.
But what's up?

84
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,790
And also eyebrows.
I don't know about you browse bugged,

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,220
bugging when chicks have like really 
like drawn on eyebrows or like just,

86
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:36,540
you know,
no eyebrow it all.

87
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,610
It's just,
it bugs the fuck out.

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,300
Why did chicks trim their eyebrows?
We don't give a fuck.

89
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,480
They don't even know if a girl has big,
bushy eyebrows.

90
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,510
We don't give a fuck.
I just got to take care of in the Middle

91
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,250
Brow,
but you know what,

92
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:55,380
if a girl is really hot and she's got a 
uni brow,

93
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,750
who gives a fuck?
I can tolerate a uni brow.

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Yeah.
You just pretend she some crazy Israeli 

95
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,160
bitch that just got out of the secret 
service over there,

96
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,080
over here spying on you.
But she falls in love and you're 

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,420
banging.
I don't think any brand would bother me 

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,420
at all.
Man.

99
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,130
Hairy legs are tripped up facial hair.
The girl,

100
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:15,570
when I was really young,
uh,

101
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,620
who was,
uh,

102
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,320
um,
she was going to an all girls school.

103
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,110
She's going to an all girls college and 
her and her friends wouldn't shave their

104
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:27,111
legs.
They were like super feminist hippie 

105
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:27,540
checks and this just did not work out.

106
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,050
The conversations that we had where it 
was like,

107
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,080
they,
they went to this completely all girl 

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,380
school that was like super,
like super ultra liberal,

109
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,610
ultra socialist ideals and the view of 
the world was very strange and they 

110
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,720
wouldn't shave.
Why should women have to shave?

111
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,620
Shave?
Like how about we both shaved?

112
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,840
If the only way to get you to shave is 
that I have the shale.

113
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,500
I'll fucking shave.
I don't mind having shaved legs.

114
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,750
I think it's weird,
but I'll do it if you'll do it.

115
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,430
I can't fuck you.
Hobbit lady.

116
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,050
You got hair on your feet.
You know,

117
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,510
that's just the trip man.
Yeah.

118
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,910
Girls don't be having here on your feet.
Please stop that.

119
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,940
But that's been.
I mean this female's shaving has been 

120
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:10,940
going on for thousands of years.
Right?

121
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,470
But what is the reason for that?
Is there an evolutionary reason?

122
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:18,120
Why are we so much more attracted to 
less hair and why his hair disgusting to

123
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:20,520
us.
Is it a hygiene thing for pussy?

124
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,990
Right?
It must be a hygiene thing,

125
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,640
right?
Like you got all that crazy here.

126
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:24,440
I don't know if you,
you,

127
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,890
you don't even know what the fuck is in 
there.

128
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,350
You don't know what's cleaner.
Visual creatures too.

129
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:31,290
So at the.
But some guys like hairy pussies,

130
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,270
hairy pussies on the comeback.
I mean Harry is very 2010,

131
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:37,340
so Ayesha Gray and some of these girls 
and they're,

132
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,630
they're rocking it.
They got the bus,

133
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,110
but they cut it off right at the top,
you know,

134
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,370
I mean they don't go all the way through
to the.

135
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,780
So the little top Bush,
but they don't hair butthole Bush go.

136
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,310
Yeah.
So what do they do?

137
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:54,311
They wax around all that laser and laser
just keep a landing patch or tweezed 

138
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,040
whole triangle.
Is that

139
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,430
like a defiance thing?
Like I'm going to redefine my sexuality.

140
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,730
I think it's just that people get so 
accustomed.

141
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,130
The one thing that the new is hot,
probably it'll go in 10 years.

142
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,080
So gray fascinates me

143
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,380
and one of the reasons why she 
fascinates me is because she's like the 

144
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,710
girl that like somehow or another is I'm
free of the porn and more into moral 

145
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:23,140
like of mainstream [inaudible] people's,
you know,

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,710
people's thoughts.
You know what I'm saying?

147
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,600
Like she's not just thought,
she's like,

148
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,780
she's like elevated,
she's left the just the total porn 

149
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,710
world.
And she's permeated regular pop culture.

150
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,120
You know?
And it's strange when something like 

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,120
that happens,
like how does one do that?

152
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,380
You know,
there's always like,

153
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,040
there's people that are like super 
successful at something like Lance 

154
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Armstrong,
boom,

155
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,650
there's the guy,
he's the guy rides the bike,

156
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,450
you know,
and Jenna Jameson,

157
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,980
there's the super porn star,
you know,

158
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:53,981
she's the one and then there was a few 
that get through the traci lords that 

159
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:54,800
get through and then other people know 
about them,

160
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,050
you know.
But Sasha gray is one,

161
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,610
she's a unique one.

162
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,690
She is.
And it's interesting because she's on 

163
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:03,690
the very hardcore side of,
of,

164
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,290
of the business too.
I mean she's no holds barred.

165
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,400
I mean she,
whatever,

166
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:11,401
whatever she's down with and she.
But she kinda does it in a way where 

167
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:14,671
she's like,
I want to explore all of the sides of 

168
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:14,800
sexuality,
including the dark side.

169
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,230
So she kinda has owned it from the 
beginning.

170
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
I think at that.
That's made it better.

171
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,280
You don't feel like Sasha,
you know,

172
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,440
our poor Sasha,
you like Sasha was doing what she wants 

173
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,020
to do and she's doing it on camera.
So that I think has helped her out a lot

174
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:31,080
and then she got a big break with that.
Uh,

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,130
Steven Soderbergh film.
Did you see that as,

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,690
as a little tough to watch the whole 
thing?

177
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,690
But it was,
it was cool.

178
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,720
I would,
yeah,

179
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,430
I would have liked it as a short movie,
you know,

180
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,530
like she reluctant to say it.

181
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,020
So I do know Sasha,
you know,

182
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,030
some of these girls will,
she was an awesome actor,

183
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:52,060
will look what you had to work with.
Well it was a cool feeling,

184
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,120
you know,
but you can't drag that on for an hour 

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,120
and a half.
It's what's the cool feeling?

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,231
What is the movie about?
It's kind of this very dark kind of 

187
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:01,231
artistic,
you know,

188
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,460
analysis of a,
of a call girl,

189
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,440
you know,
and how that interaction is.

190
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,630
But it could have been done with one 
scene.

191
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,030
Like you get it,
you get,

192
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,940
you get the feeling you get how this 
interaction goes.

193
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,980
So in the girlfriend experience,
is she providing like an intimate call 

194
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,250
girl experience that it's like having a 
girlfriend?

195
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:19,340
Is that promises?
Exactly.

196
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,270
I saw like two minutes of it once on 
television about right.

197
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Really minutes was the last to talk to 
this guy and hugging him and then they 

198
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,390
cut the black and I was like,
what the fuck is that?

199
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,940
Just kind of a snippet that lasts a 
little bit too long.

200
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,920
That's a fucking strange thing,
man.

201
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,660
You ever have a buddy that's in love 
with a prostitute?

202
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,090
I've had guys fall in love with a 
stripper.

203
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,280
The t pains.
Well,

204
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,260
I had a friend who was in love with a 
prostitute.

205
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,470
He was a guy used to play pool with a 
very nice guy,

206
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,970
but he was unfortunate looking and uh,
he did not do very well with the ladies

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,690
and he would go to this massage parlor 
and get jerked off by this one and a,

208
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,940
it was like one of those creepy massage 
parlors,

209
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:04,941
you know,
like it wasn't really a massage parlor 

210
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:04,941
and like,
you know,

211
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:04,941
they like rub your back and then just 
go,

212
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:05,190
what's up?
Pull your Dick out,

213
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,730
let's do this.
And uh,

214
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,840
he wanted to ask her out to dinner 
outside and she wouldn't go out with 

215
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,171
them.
And he was trying to figure out like 

216
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:16,171
he's asking me what I should do at the 
magic words are,

217
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,240
what should I do to get her to come out 
with me?

218
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,400
I really would like to see her outside 
of the club.

219
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,470
And I was like,
Oh,

220
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,530
you're on your own.
So the threads like that,

221
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,140
there's so many things wrong with what 
you're trying to do.

222
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,790
I mean,
yeah.

223
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,460
Okay.
Well,

224
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,540
okay,
what happens then?

225
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,740
You become boyfriend and girlfriend and 
she agrees,

226
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,480
looks and no more in the mouth.
Only hand jobs from now on.

227
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Like do you guys,
do you come to an agreement or just 

228
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,420
accept the fact that this is what she 
does at work?

229
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,820
That's work for her.
That's tough.

230
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,230
Strange,
right?

231
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,430
It's strange that we're so.
It's so genetically attached.

232
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,540
We're so genetically attached to control
each other.

233
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,270
Sexuality.
You know,

234
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,330
you could have a wife that was a massage
therapist and she could be a great deep 

235
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:05,520
tissues.
She'll let her,

236
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,400
let her rub your Bob.
Really,

237
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,260
your wife's going to rub me.
She could've rubbed me with oil all over

238
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:15,261
my back.
And am I going to grown while she's 

239
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:15,261
rubbing me?
I'm going to go,

240
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:15,530
oh yeah.
Uh,

241
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,880
so good.
And you're going to be cool with that.

242
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,040
Yeah.
It's okay because it's just rubbing your

243
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:25,041
back.
But if she rubs your Dick and you make 

244
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,041
those same noises,
I mean,

245
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,460
basically she's doing the same thing.
She just massaging you,

246
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,980
but it just feels way better,
but it feels too good.

247
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,690
Too much.
Too much.

248
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,900
You're going to get psychologically 
attached to her rubbing on your deck.

249
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,600
You can't do that.
We draw the line.

250
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,360
It's a funny.
It's a funny paradigm and it's certainly

251
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,960
always been one sided.
I mean,

252
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,150
I wouldn't even want to check who does 
massages.

253
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,700
Yeah.
I would feel creeped out.

254
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,700
I get a bunch of my buddies come over 
and,

255
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,770
and massage.
I'm like,

256
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:51,050
what could you imagine if you had a 
check that was doing massages and you're

257
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,070
really into.
And then one of your buddies started 

258
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,070
getting massages from her.
I can't,

259
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,070
Bro.
What the fuck?

260
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,690
What are you doing?
And they have a nice eight ladies and 

261
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,830
give them a hug.
Thank you so much for the big tip.

262
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,000
Please.
You're the best.

263
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,190
I'm not the best.
He's the best.

264
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:08,350
He kill me.
I can't wait for the next one.

265
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,580
When's our next one?
When's the next one?

266
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,730
When we doing this again,
stop and you're like,

267
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,140
Hey,
what are you guys fucking like?

268
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,220
What's going on over here?
Goddammit,

269
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,350
you're causing pleasure with your hands 
and rubbing his ass cheeks.

270
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:22,180
What's up?
What's up?

271
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,900
It's interesting because you have those,
those conversations like would you tell 

272
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,600
me if mark got a hard on while you were 
massaged them?

273
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,180
What are you saying?
Stop it.

274
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,160
Yeah.

275
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,970
There's a real distinction for me.
I mean,

276
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:41,810
and there's some people who won't let 
their girls get a massage like I have.

277
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,740
Yeah,
for sure.

278
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,070
You know what I mean?
They won't let them get a massage from 

279
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,130
another male Zeus,
you know,

280
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,570
and that's some Taliban type shit,
but you know,

281
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:53,620
and then it just as a whole variety of 
different,

282
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,710
you know,
different levels of what people are 

283
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,710
comfortable with,
you know,

284
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,690
that's fucking seen you naked and robin.
But yeah,

285
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,710
it's good to look at your booth.
Yeah,

286
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,650
for sure.
For sure.

287
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:07,360
I mean it's,
it's an interesting paradigm.

288
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,140
I mean,
for me,

289
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,830
I think I wouldn't,
we have,

290
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,460
you know,
me and my girl have a very,

291
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:14,170
like very open,
honest,

292
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,690
you know,
relationship and she killed him.

293
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,240
He was like,
don't respect,

294
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,890
we respect each other's ability to just 
want to go out and experience things.

295
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,900
But Chris,
Marcus's Tampax is brought to you by the

296
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:31,110
fleshlight.
Please continue with it.

297
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,340
But there would be,
there's a,

298
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,030
there's a real hard line between like 
that.

299
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,830
Like I could,
you know,

300
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,850
I'm totally cool with her getting 
massaged and even in like some perfect 

301
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,771
circumstance where there was some unit 
who needed to manually get her off at 

302
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:48,370
some point.
I think I would be cool with that.

303
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,310
But at no point,
well you know,

304
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,730
whatever they're doing,
they don't exist anymore,

305
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,570
be cool with.
But do they still exist?

306
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:55,800
They should chop your balls off.

307
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,540
Some situation where it was very 
mechanical.

308
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,160
She goes in for a service he 
mechanically gets right.

309
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,990
But at the point where it's like he's 
lusting and she's lost a mare.

310
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,820
That's when the,
that's when the board,

311
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,290
that's where the fucking hard line is 
Bloomberg at about it.

312
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,580
And they'll last just physical.
Yeah,

313
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,280
no,
it's for me.

314
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I can make the connection.
It's the same as rubbing the back or 

315
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,070
doing something like that is the same as
you

316
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,490
to jerk off salon.
Go there.

317
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,100
Just some girl just rubs your balls that
hot oil and jerks you off and that's it.

318
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,730
Nothing.
Nothing was going on.

319
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:33,410
She kind of fairly mechanical.
Thank you.

320
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,670
That was great.
That was awesome.

321
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,730
I got rid of that.
Not like you go out and talk about your 

322
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,820
childhood and I don't even know my dad.
Oh my God.

323
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,190
I don't know my dad either.
That's where they've seen.

324
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:49,191
No,
your hands laying in the field looking 

325
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:49,191
up at the stars.
Fuck all that,

326
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:50,420
man.
That's just bullshit.

327
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,220
They're good guys.
The real question is going to be what 

328
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:05,081
happens when we create artificial people
and fuck them and are people even going 

329
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,560
to bother with relationships?
That's the real question.

330
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,800
You are on the brink of this with this 
flashlight thing because now you guys 

331
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,240
are the first people that have created 
an effective artificial vagina.

332
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,570
All those other ones are bullshit.
All those blow up dolls.

333
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,310
Those are for Bachelor Party gag gift 
bags.

334
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,260
All right.
Those are silly.

335
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,330
Nobody really fucks blow up dolls.
If you do,

336
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:24,920
it's not good.
You're better off jerking off.

337
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:27,110
You might fuck one once,
but they're not good.

338
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,330
Yup.
You guys have engineered a true 

339
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:32,570
artificial vagina,
but this is just step one.

340
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,730
Remember when tvs,
when you go over your grandfather's 

341
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,911
house and the TV was this big giant ass 
fucking cabinet and the TV itself was 

342
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,411
only like 11 inches across and you need 
this fucking monstrous piece of 

343
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:47,650
furniture with tubes and shit.
The bag of wires and memory,

344
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,990
sometimes sparks would come out the back
and you'd have to open up that there was

345
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,110
a particle board back to it and you 
unscrew it and pull it back and look 

346
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,570
inside the bowels of this fucking beast.
Now look at it.

347
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:02,570
You can watch your little iphone slips 
in your pocket,

348
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,730
man,
and it's way higher resolution.

349
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:09,731
So much better.
Much better experience watching a movie 

350
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,690
on your iphone than it is one of those 
stupid tvs or an I pad.

351
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,090
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

352
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,710
the ipad of the fake pussies coming.

353
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,440
Hopefully.
Uh,

354
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,760
hopefully.
Flashlight will be the ones.

355
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,050
Do you think.
So are you guys working with genetic 

356
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,050
engineers?
Are you on the cusp of nanotechnology?

357
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,940
Well,
you know what I mean?

358
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,050
All of that.
That's kind of.

359
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:26,810
Yeah,
a golden goose.

360
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:29,690
Like the more realistic you can get it 
interactive,

361
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,720
you know,
like fully people have tried to do it 

362
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:34,720
but no one's done it well yet.
So obviously we're looking into it.

363
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,251
I mean things have to evolve.
I mean a flashlight looking into 

364
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:39,251
robotics.
Yeah.

365
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:42,930
Well to a certain one.
Robotics just said just leave it.

366
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,540
Yeah,
I mean I don't want to get too much into

367
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:50,541
it,
but we've certainly explored all those 

368
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:50,541
different things.
Even making it so that they can register

369
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,050
your performance so you could almost,
you know,

370
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:57,051
log in and see your performance is 
compared to somebody else on your 

371
00:15:57,051 --> 00:16:00,410
machine courts.
How do you register?

372
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,640
You have high scores like high score.
You are devaluing the personal 

373
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,780
experience too.
You're taking it too far,

374
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:11,781
man.
Two thousand strokes shouldn't be like 

375
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:11,781
three.
This is a,

376
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:12,750
you're not fucking a person who is 
trying to make feel good.

377
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,640
You're trying to shoot him

378
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,030
load.
I,

379
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,400
if I do this 10 times that I'm like,
why is it taking so long?

380
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,260
You know,
you should have,

381
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,860
you should have like fleshlight pants 
for gay guys that like the,

382
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,260
there's like a thing like that.
The end of the fleshlight.

383
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,200
So it goes on.
They're assholes.

384
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,630
When other guys fuck the other guy.
It feels better.

385
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,250
You know,
like it.

386
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:35,050
Like it feels like a pussy adapter for 
another guy's asshole.

387
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,110
How do you know that?
They don't like the feeling of guys.

388
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,990
Assholes.
I don't know.

389
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:42,991
I'm just saying mix it up a little bit.
They only have one type dude is fucking 

390
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:43,450
you in the buddy's fucking you in the 
butt.

391
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,910
All right.
This is kind of a filter for that.

392
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Something rather disturbing is that 
actually happened except uh,

393
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,710
the guy just put the fleshlight straight
in his butt.

394
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,930
Oh really?
I didn't see that.

395
00:16:56,931 --> 00:17:00,610
But our flesh Jack team informed me 
there was a video.

396
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,660
This video is a video.
Guys stuffed the flashlight up his 

397
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,100
button and another guy fucked the flush 
side.

398
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,090
Would that,
would that make you gay?

399
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,730
I'm not sure about that if you do fish 
in the but it's gay.

400
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,170
Listen,
if you.

401
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,630
Yeah,
but I'm saying if a guy fucks you,

402
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,550
your flashlight.
Okay.

403
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:22,070
See if you stuck a flashlight up your 
ass that's gay.

404
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,010
Or if the guy fucks your flashlight,
it's touching.

405
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Is he getting at what you're saying?
Can you just fucking a rubber vagina?

406
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,040
It's gay.
If you're somehow touching a guy getting

407
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,360
okay,
what if you don't touch them?

408
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,920
What if you just assume like a high 
mountain guide?

409
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,460
Spread your legs apart.
He keeps his legs closed.

410
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Want me to say no for a reason was the 
queer queer?

411
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,450
That would be weird.
You know,

412
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:56,451
one of our most popular selling units,
it's called the stamina training unit 

413
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,300
though this.
Well,

414
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,120
the concept is basically that your hand 
doesn't feel anything like posting,

415
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,560
so it doesn't prepare you to have sex.
So there's a lot of anxiety,

416
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:09,561
performance anxiety,
people who don't last long enough to 

417
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:09,561
last longer.
So you know,

418
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:14,150
we've been able to give them a product 
that's very like highly sensitive inner 

419
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,050
canal so they can use it and get a 
little bit more prepared.

420
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,810
And sensitize the people love it.
Like we get feedback like,

421
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,490
man,
thank you so much.

422
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:21,030
You know,
like,

423
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,760
I've always had problems with this,
but now I've gotten a lot better.

424
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Yeah.
The first time you actually stick your 

425
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:28,900
dick inside a vagina.
Oh yeah.

426
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,220
I remember the first time I had sex.
I came in one second.

427
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,790
I came in one second.
I stuck at it.

428
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,580
I pulled it out and there was just loads
everywhere.

429
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,570
Oh my God.
I barely made it.

430
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,850
Barely made.
Have no idea what that's going to feel 

431
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,181
like.
The first time I blew a load I was in 

432
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:46,550
shock.
I didn't even know that I wasn't.

433
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,250
Nobody told me Shit.
All right.

434
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,110
No,
my parents didn't tell me anything.

435
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,780
And when I was a,
I guess I was like 14 or 15,

436
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,960
15.
My girlfriend blooming and I busted one 

437
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,680
in her mouth and my ears rang and I was 
like,

438
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,050
what the hell was that?
Like,

439
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,510
I couldn't believe that.
Like stuff comes out of you.

440
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,740
Like you could feel it come on.

441
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,520
And you're like,
whoa.

442
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,650
Oh,
that's what I've been building up to it.

443
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:14,651
Yeah.
I didn't know that there was even an 

444
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,511
orgasm thing.
I recall it being like a 32nd or 

445
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,830
different.
A ridiculous amount that's fucking ears 

446
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,520
rang for the first time I came,
my ears rang.

447
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,110
They haven't ranked sense.
Wow.

448
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:28,460
Because I never gave myself a day one 
day off since.

449
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,000
No,
I did one time for my website.

450
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,040
No,
it was like 30 days or something like 

451
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,040
that.
I tried to do.

452
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,040
But yeah,
you,

453
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,040
you,
you know,

454
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,510
you never recaptured.
It's like they say with heroin addicts 

455
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,020
the first time they shoot heroin,
it's just insanely beautiful experience.

456
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:44,180
And from then on you're chasing the 
Dragon Dragon here.

457
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,410
Yeah.
You know that expression?

458
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,460
Yeah.
What is that?

459
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,070
The first load you blow.
So like it's good as it gets.

460
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,800
Kids love it,
enjoy it.

461
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,130
But the experience is so rough that it's
terrible.

462
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,610
I mean,
you're just nervous.

463
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:57,440
I remember,
man,

464
00:19:57,441 --> 00:20:02,441
I remember the first time I'm trying to 
figure out how to use this condom and 

465
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:02,700
I'm going into the bathroom and I'm just
like,

466
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,850
it's not working.
Right.

467
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:08,851
And she's in the bed and she's ready and
I was like literally like the face was 

468
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,320
hot and I just came out and just gave 
up.

469
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,250
I was like,
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,130
We got to come up with a different 
paradigm to make this happen.

471
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,730
Like,
you know,

472
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,770
and eventually you figure it out and 
work.

473
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:19,400
But that first time is fucking brutal to

474
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,180
talk about.
What do you think about these fighters 

475
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,490
that hold off for.
That's ridiculous.

476
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,590
They're crazy.
They're distracting the shit out of 

477
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:30,590
them.
So yeah,

478
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:30,590
that seems like a really bad at.
It's so silly.

479
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,690
I don't think there's no.
No writing,

480
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,770
no,
no tests,

481
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:39,771
no studies done ever that show a 
decrease in performance due to the fact 

482
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:44,151
that you're having sex.
I think the distraction that you would 

483
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:45,360
get from not having sex would be way 
more problematic.

484
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,070
That would fuck you up more.
Will up your train of thought.

485
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:53,071
You wouldn't want to fight you on it.
Get some pussy fucking late when he got 

486
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:54,430
laid in eight weeks when going through 
training camp.

487
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,510
That's crazy.
I mean it seemed.

488
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,520
They seemed to say that it builds 
aggression that they just want to 

489
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,890
conquer.
I'm sure it does,

490
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:07,891
but just aggression.
Do you need a fucking professional cage 

491
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,130
fighter already?

492
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,000
Chances are you're aggressive.
You know,

493
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,030
you really need to be more fucked up 
under a better ground game though,

494
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:21,031
because they always want to get on the 
ground who used to fight and he used to 

495
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:24,040
fuck right before he fought Tyson.
That should be the end of discussion.

496
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,870
Yeah,
I didn't.

497
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,130
I didn't understand from sexual 
intercourse.

498
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:32,131
It just is a natural feeling for me.
I just had to make sure I was relaxed 

499
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,320
before my big fights.
Those all tyson training videos are 

500
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,320
beautiful.
The passwords,

501
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,090
his early fights man,
like Marvis frazier,

502
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,750
you're wanting.
Tamara was frazier fight.

503
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:45,751
That was a salt.
He just ran up to that regular dude and 

504
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:45,751
beat the fuck out of him.
What?

505
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:49,330
His Super Alpha body.
That shit didn't even make any sense.

506
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,450
He came out of nowhere and got everybody
excited about fighting again for the 

507
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,410
longest time after Mohammed Ali.
Nobody gave a fuck about boxing.

508
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,570
It's like the Larry Holmes era.
Everybody's like,

509
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:03,571
wow,
that's Larry Holmes was fighting pink 

510
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:03,571
Thomas.
I don't even know if they ever fought,

511
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:04,570
but you know my point,
it was like,

512
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,650
who gives a shit?
Oh,

513
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,060
Tony tubs.
Who gives a shit?

514
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,740
Michael Dokes,
whatever.

515
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,770
You know that all of a sudden this crazy
motherfucker moving 100 times faster 

516
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,320
than everybody else and just smashing 
people in the face at will.

517
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,780
That's what we wanted to see.
We didn't want to see that.

518
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:24,310
Those fights were fights.
You want to see us salts two minutes.

519
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:25,210
You're.
It was worth it.

520
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,000
Not really though.
People get pissed off.

521
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,930
You have a bunch of friends over for 
review because nobody gives a fuck about

522
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,330
the prelims and boxing.
That's one of the beautiful things about

523
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,520
the UFC.
Got a UFC card.

524
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,730
You're not just getting the main event,
you're getting a fuck load of other 

525
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,330
flights and they're all well matched and
they're all people you give a shit about

526
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,750
are all.

527
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,760
They're all exciting fights,
especially the ones that actually make 

528
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760
the air.
So there's a bunch of shit to watch.

529
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,110
So if the end fight is only like 15 
seconds,

530
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,240
you know,
like Anderson Silva and you know James 

531
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Irvin or something like Bam,
it's over.

532
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,950
You don't feel ripped off.
I feel like,

533
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,960
oh,
we saw a lot of shit before we saw those

534
00:22:58,961 --> 00:22:59,890
Tyson fights.
Man.

535
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,950
I'd have friends saying I ain't even 
bought.

536
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,770
The last one was 34 could circuits.
It's like,

537
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,290
yeah man.
But that's kind of an epic moment.

538
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,850
The one I missed was the one where you 
lost a.

539
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,250
I saw because I was like,
who fucking beat the shit out of this 

540
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,621
guy?
Buster Douglas was like 60 to one 

541
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:19,621
underdog or something crazy.
Crazy.

542
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:20,560
What was the other?
He was something Nutty,

543
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,330
right?
It wasn't like 31 or something.

544
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,930
You got the.
And then I remember I watched it,

545
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,050
I watched the tape and I was convinced 
whilst watching the tape that he was 

546
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,050
going to win.

547
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm like,
Tyson's going to win this.

548
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,950
I was like,
I know he's gonna win.

549
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,980
I know he got knocked out,
but I was watching a fucking replay of 

550
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,050
it and I was like,
she's going to win this.

551
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:43,051
I know he's got a big fucking joke,
man.

552
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,190
You can't be losing ice.
It doesn't lose.

553
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,400
It's important that when you're a kid to
realize that there are human beings,

554
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,670
that everyone's just a human being 
because there's a few people that just 

555
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:54,710
pass that human being marked in your 
brain,

556
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,590
you know,
like Mike Tyson or meeting somebody,

557
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:00,620
meeting some famous dude.
I met ace freely when I was a little kid

558
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,590
and all of a sudden he was just as dude,
you know,

559
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,840
ace Frehley was the lead guitarist of 
kiss for people don't know.

560
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
And uh,
my uncle used to work in an advertising 

561
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,080
agency and uh,
we're in his office,

562
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm hanging out with my uncle and all of
a sudden this dude walks in and it's ace

563
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,270
freely.

564
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,820
And I was a huge kiss fan and they 
didn't even have makeup on.

565
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,260
This is back when kiss wore makeup.
Look,

566
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,020
you didn't know who they are freely.
I was like,

567
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:26,021
what the fuck?
I couldn't believe that dude was right 

568
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,140
there.
And as you get older you go,

569
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,310
oh,
that's just another dude.

570
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,980
Yeah,
like Kenny loggins.

571
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,770
Once I brought people like Kenny loggins
that people think that way about.

572
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,650
I met Kenny loggins.
Pretty cool.

573
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,330
Did you dance?
He's the one who plays the flute,

574
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,090
right?
Was He?

575
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,750
Oh,
not Kenny loggins.

576
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,510
Kenny g,
Kenny G.

577
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,490
I didn't meet footloose.
I met the flute.

578
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,810
Dude.
Does he play the flute?

579
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,760
What does Kenny log?
Employee clarinet or something?

580
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:57,761
Gary.
Is he the only dude to ever get that 

581
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:57,770
famous from playing that instrument?
Right.

582
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,040
He must be a bad motherfucker.
Kenny g is like the Lance Armstrong of 

583
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,040
the flute or whatever the fuck you.

584
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,140
Pied Piper was pretty popular.
What does Kenny g play?

585
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:11,170
Saxophone.
Does he put aside a little bit of sac 

586
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,170
motors that John just have a super white
guy?

587
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,790
Saxophone or horrible.
Super White.

588
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,190
Super White Guy.
Clarinet.

589
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,880
Yeah.
The dance.

590
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,990
Again,
it was Kenny g was giant for awhile.

591
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,760
Man and giant with anger.
People get angry at Kenny g music.

592
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,090
You know like dudes like comics are 
always use.

593
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,580
Kenny g was an awesome punchline.
If you want to shit on somebody.

594
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,520
No.
Why is it that it was the amount?

595
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,640
I think it's the emasculation that he 
represented.

596
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,630
He represents dudes married to women.
They don't want to be married to out on 

597
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,581
dates,
having to go to a Kenny g concert and 

598
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:55,391
just sitting there and shit in a world 
of shit when you can be with your 

599
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:57,020
friends at the bar,
drinking and throwing darts,

600
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,960
talk and shit.
Watching sports and having fun.

601
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:00,500
No,
no,

602
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:00,840
no,
no,

603
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:01,160
no,
no,

604
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:01,520
no,
no.

605
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:03,500
You had a Kenny g concert,
stupid.

606
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,920
And you have a jacket on because she 
likes the way you look with jackets.

607
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,670
I like a sport jacket and he got your 
fucking sport.

608
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,770
That's what raised the ire and you're 
eating shit.

609
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,570
That's it.
That's the end of the show.

610
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,960
That was the romantic ending it with 
Kenny G.

611
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,110
before we go July,
I brought a gift for a.

612
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,400
Oh,
what do you got Brian here?

613
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,110
What do you got?
So,

614
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:24,740
you know,
people,

615
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,010
people kind of overlook a lot of very 
legal and very cool substances that are 

616
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,940
available.
And uh,

617
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,230
so I brought you guys some Blue Lotus 
oil.

618
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,160
Now,
as you know,

619
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:39,161
Lotus,
Lotus oil was historically prize from 

620
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:42,021
the land of the Lotus eaters,
kind of gives you this euphoric feeling 

621
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:42,950
and it's existed.
A lot of Hindu art work,

622
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,130
the lotus flower.

623
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,660
So it's um,
it's actually,

624
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,700
you know,
quite they taste like a ton of lotus oil

625
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,720
to make this one little vial here.
This might be,

626
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,210
it might be loud as I can do it.
So.

627
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,020
Well,
what is it?

628
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,620
So it's a little vial here.
Let me open this up here.

629
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,220
That did extract like out of thousands 
and thousands and thousands of loads.

630
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,940
It's an actual ton of pedals to make the
pedals 2000 pounds to make that little 

631
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,940
vial and you make a little of that and 
then.

632
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,490
So then they make this vow is to.
Oh,

633
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:19,491
he dropped it.
So it'd be an issue.

634
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,490
So a large is 2000 pedals.
It must be 2000 pounds.

635
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,520
Yeah,
I mean I mean 2000 pound believable.

636
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,521
So it makes it makes sense,
like an ounce of the oil and what does 

637
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:36,500
it look like in a room like this fucking
time.

638
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,030
So it was very pricey.
So I took that,

639
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,770
I actually review it on my blog where 
you pull it down to us and you can check

640
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,100
it out.
And I took it.

641
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:48,310
Yeah.
Have you had a third one?

642
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:50,300
But you've had about.
I had about a half of a mile.

643
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:55,301
It kind of comes out tufts.
So I gave it a stiff shake because that 

644
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:55,301
what you,
you.

645
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:55,640
This was full and there was no,
no,

646
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,990
this is brand new.
This is brand new.

647
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,250
It's brand new.
So this is how it comes.

648
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:01,010
It comes out for took maybe maybe about 
half of that,

649
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,730
maybe took about half of that and it was
pretty Rad.

650
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,920
You feel you feel very euphoric and you 
know,

651
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:09,170
you,
you're everything,

652
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:12,620
all your sensations feel good and it's 
not overpowering.

653
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,110
It's not something that like takes you 
and hit you with a hammer.

654
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,540
But when you say I love you,
your girlfriend,

655
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,650
you really mean it,
you know,

656
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:20,140
like listen,
I really need all the time.

657
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,810
Not like you really mean it,
but it's like you really feel it.

658
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,970
You know what I'm saying?
Like you feel the emotion,

659
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,220
really feel it all the time.
Dude.

660
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,920
But it's like you man,
I'm a problem for women.

661
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,740
Some crazy dreams I dreamed.
I was like,

662
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,850
ah,
never dreams this dream as a vampire 

663
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,571
playing basketball,
doing shots back steam out from 

664
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:44,860
underneath the basket and just reject 
some dude and Shaq dunk on vampire.

665
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,140
Super relaxing,
very relaxing you for like very kind of 

666
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,530
Cathartic.
Like you could still function.

667
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,760
Totally.
Totally.

668
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:57,761
It was very lucid and stuff.
Do you feel intoxicated at all or not 

669
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:01,031
really?
You just feel it like in a bad ass mood 

670
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:01,031
and it's almost like the stuff that 
troubles you,

671
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:01,980
they go away.
What about you?

672
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,230
Are you,
are you comfortable that your reaction 

673
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,230
time?
Would it be this?

674
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,120
I Siam Yeah.
I mean you'd be able to drive and it 

675
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,870
doesn't have that kind of artificial 
feeling that some of the other opiates 

676
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,910
and sedatives and stuff kind of allergic
that lotus though.

677
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:15,080
And you're like,
oh shit.

678
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:20,081
I know shit.
I didn't even find out if you're 

679
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:21,830
allergic to Lloyd gay tests,
do you like Kenny g dot?

680
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,240
You can't take this shit.

681
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,310
And on that note,
that's a perfect way to end this.

682
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,450
Thank you very much.

683
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:33,270

we give them two thumbs up.

688
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,010
It is

689
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,010
way better than just jerking off.
I have a new segment to that bit my 

690
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,990
mind.
My bid on the fleshlight is growing very

691
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,300
strong.
