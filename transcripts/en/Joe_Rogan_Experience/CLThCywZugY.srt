1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,910
I am one of the directors of science and
my specialty is communications and the

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,660
idea that a mission ends when you return
to the data,

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,880
when you make the discoveries,
when the scientists publish their

4
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:20,400
papers,
to me the mission doesn't end until you

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,890
have some sort of public involvement
until you have some sort of public

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,980
buyin.
I think that's as important as any other

7
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,500
part of the mission you had been trying
to tell people for years that our

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:32,220
communications team on a mission is just
like having your crack team of

9
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:34,800
electrical engineers or your or your
best computer programmers.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,680
You need to have people that really
understand communication as well.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,371
Uh,
it,

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:38,941
it helps.
I mean,

13
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,710
in my case,
I started out as a research

14
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:43,680
astrophysicist and so I understand a lot
of the topics as well,

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,060
but I do communications now a NASA and
as far as why NASA is important,

16
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,940
I think this is one of these things that
people have no idea.

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,100
We run at the moment,
108 science missions.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,090
Those are mostly spacecraft.
Some of them are on balloons or sounding

19
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,910
rockets or on the space station.
Uh,

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,010
some of them are on the earth.
We have people embedded with the,

21
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:06,600
uh,
the Zombie reindeer herders,

22
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,840
trying to understand how climate change
is changing the migration of reindeer

23
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,381
herds.
I mean,

24
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:14,100
it's,
it's amazing that NASA is all over and,

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,280
you know,
everything from the disaster mitigation

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,450
from all of those hurricanes.
We actually sent staff to Puerto Rico

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,390
when Fema was overwhelmed.
They've been setting up communication

28
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,440
centers.
Um,

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,900
I mean everything from determining what
set off the big bang to,

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,740
you know,
where are those wildfires going to be

31
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:35,820
spreading to in southern California.
We have 108 missions and I've never seen

32
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,040
any organization operate more
efficiently.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
I've never worked with more brilliant
people.

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,470
Um,
I think people often don't understand

35
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,870
what the real value is as far as blue
sky research.

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,900
You know,
people talk about spinoffs and people

37
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,970
joke about things like velcro and Tang.
I mean,

38
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,440
those are jokes,
but the,

39
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,480
uh,
the more intelligent people might notice

40
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,290
things like,
you know,

41
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,920
microprocessors started at NASA cell
phones,

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,650
the reason you have computers,
the reason the United States was poised

43
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,290
to lead the computer revolution was
because of the Apollo program.

44
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,483
But,
um,

45
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,300
I don't know.
I mean all of those kind of fall flat to

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
tell you the truth,
I think that people don't understand.

47
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,470
It was a,
a NASA satellite doing research just out

48
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:17,880
of curiosity to see what gases in the
atmosphere that discovered that the

49
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,070
ozone hole is being depleted in the 19
eighties.

50
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,160
And uh,
the NASA scientists with a number of

51
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,310
university scientists went running to
the UN instead.

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,170
If we don't do something,
we are literally going to destroy the

53
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,110
planet.
And they made the Montreal.

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,360
They actually got the Montreal protocol
sign.

55
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,010
They actually make treaties,
the other band,

56
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,740
these chemicals that we're depleting our
ozone layer.

57
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,610
And we've since done an atmospheric
models that show that we would have

58
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:45,540
actually destroyed the ozone layer.
Had we done nothing by the year 20,

59
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,230
60,
which if not in my lifetime is probably

60
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,890
in our children's lifetime.
And um,

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,330
basically that would have destroyed
agriculture.

62
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,700
Crops would've failed all over the
world.

63
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,560
You couldn't have livestock outside.
People couldn't have lived outside.

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,180
Um,
we very nearly destroyed civilization

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,520
and your grandchildren would have lived
through that.

66
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,730
And so when people talk about what's the
best NASA spinoff,

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,190
you know,
the worth of blue sky research that you

68
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,770
don't understand where it's going to
lead best friend,

69
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,850
if I know this grandchildren.
