Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Um, my boy woke me up at like every hour. I'm hoping I didn't have mommy brain

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       boom. And we're alive. The newly mommy. Dr Rhonda Patrick. First of all, congratulations on making people.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       Thank you Mandy. For Person. Yeah, the colonial project was a success. We were talking

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       for the show about what a strange biological shift happens in your mind and isn't it? It's amazing, isn't it? And not just your mind, right? Like your person.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       Absolutely. Yeah. It's completely amazing am. I had no idea that I would love being a mom so much. I kind of waited till later in life to, to have a child and that was for a reason because as you know, really driven and loved what I was doing in science and I felt I didn't feel that calling to like I've got to reproduce it. Forgot to reproduce. And then finally I was like, well, if I don't reproduce now I might not get a chance. So, you know, I, that sort of pressure kind of nudged me a little bit I think. Um, but yeah, the whole process of getting pregnant and having this like, you know, person growing inside of me, just the whole thing was amazing. And then after having the baby and he's like a person now and he's four months old and developing this little personality, I'm like so amazed by how in love I am with him and how like, how much I would do anything for him and how almost nothing really affects me as much like stress of various things in life, you know, I just look at him and you know, see him, smile at me and do some little things that are like uniquely him and the wonder and awe in his eyes and it's just like gone, like, it's really amazing sound.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Yeah, that's crazy. It changes your life. It changes who you are as a human being, you know, in uh, changes in a way that you did have a lot of friends that are like, I don't want kids. I never wanted kids. And like wow, I kind of didn't really want kids either when I was 30 kids. But then once you have them, you realized like, oh, like I was just sort of attached to this idea of living my life the way I was living it, and I'm like, this is the way I like to live life. And then you have a kid, you're like, oh no, I love this kid more than anything. Like. So now my whole idea of what life is shifts into this new paradigms and also the thing like reproduce always weirds me out because you're not, you're making people not reproducing anything. You know, I mean you're, you're making people. It's a whole new person. You're not reproducing you.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       True. I mean it, it is in a way. I mean there's definitely reproductions the right way to say you're passing on a lot of the same, you know, variations in genes that you have and you know, you're obviously, you know, there are similarities in the way they look to, to, to both you and your spouse. But yeah, it is a completely new person with a new personality. But of course, all that is shaped a lot by your diet and exercise

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       and all those things that you do, even aside from your actual genetics and passing on the sequence of DNA, like just, you know, things that you do in your lifestyle actually can affect, um, you know, the child's neurocognitive development and uh, you know, met metabolism now where you cognizant of that or you obviously you're very aware of that. But did you, what did you do to act on that? I should ask? Yeah. So I mean I did. I'm definitely became obsessed with trying to optimize everything I could, you know, because I'm a scientist and I can sort of sift through the literature. I think I, you can, you can kind of get stuck in this loop where you want to like optimize everything and you kind of have to like chill out a little bit. But you know, during pregnancy I wanted to make sure, you know, all the micronutrients I was getting, you know, because they're so important for brain development and like full late magnesium, iron, zinc, and then Dha, vitamin D, All these things were super important.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       I'm actually with the Dha, I found out that I'm taking, so Dha is the marine omega three fatty acid that's predominantly found in like micro algae for vegetarians versus, but in fish fatty fish, well it turns out that the Dha that's in what's called phospholipid form, which is something that's found in the row of fish. So like fish eggs, it's also found in Krill as well. Um, and fish only have like a small percentage, so fish have Dha like one percent of their djs and phospholipid form. Whereas the row of the fish, anywhere between 40 to 70 percent is in phospholipid form. And the thing that's really cool about this is that the fossil liquid form, it's been shown when you take that orally, it stays more of, it ends up in the phospho lip, a certain type of phospholipid form in the blood that has been shown to get into the developing fetal brain 10 times better than an Dha and non libet form free fatty acid form.

Speaker 3:          00:04:54       So it was just something that should be consumed. Look for regular people as well or for primarily mothers. So yeah, for I think both, but the fact that it gets taken up into the developing fetal brain 10 times better was enough, you know, ammunition for me to be like I'm eating the Salmon Roe, you know, but, but yeah, so they're all have also been studies on preclinical studies on, on, uh, taking Dha, EPA and fossil performing in, in mice. It's taken up better than non fossil Lippitt. And then there's been some clinical studies where they like radio label and follow it in humans. And again, it's taken up better in the brain by humans as well. And actually what's really interesting is I just submitted a paper for publication on Alzheimer's disease and a certain variation in a gene called apoe e four, which I think you and I talked a lot about traumatic brain injury, um, and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease.

Speaker 3:          00:05:53       And basically I'm a bunch of, you know, dementia type of problems. Um, well April before sort of helps increase that risk. So I've, you know, turns out there is because there's different transport mechanisms to get Dha into the brain. The phospholipid form appears to be better for April before, and that's sort of my finding. I'm not going to get all into the mechanism, but that's hopefully fingers crossed going to be accepted for peer review from peer review with the next couple months. That's fascinating. So you eating Salmon Roe, that's what you were saying you were getting your source from? I was, yeah, I was, I was eating Salmon Roe. Um, I was ordering it from a company that, you know, has wild Alaskan Salmon Roe and then you can buy it in bulk. The company was called a vital choice is nasty. It tasted nasty during my first trimester. I was like, Oh, maybe I should wait.

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       But you know, the texture a lot of people don't like, like Dan doesn't like the texture because like the salmon roe is like bigger. The fish eggs are bigger and so it can kind of pop in like you get like little fish to fish for trout really trout would eat salmon roe. So we would fish for trout using salmon eggs. Well, I mean the salmon eggs are like quite a bit larger. Yeah. The credit larger, there's other ones like I think it's the flying fish that are really small in the Fascial Epa, Dha and foster the bid form varies from species, you know, different types of fish and things like that. But generally speaking they're, you know, it's, it's a good thing to eat and especially during pregnancy. So how did you consume it on Avocados? I put it on top of Bob Ocado is with some lemon juice and like, like hot sauce.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       So just kind of like a Paleo training. Yeah, it was like a lot of fat. So avocados have potassium, low, mono unsaturated fat and vitamin E, all the different forms, you know. So Avocados, a mono unsaturated fat and saturated fat, right. They have a small amount of saturated fat. Probably a small amount. Yeah. When I say they have, like, typically when I talk about foods, um, I'll talk about what's, you know, what's concentrated, so it's like really concentrated in Mahnomen saturated fat. So whereas like if you say, you know, butter or cheese and it's concentrated in saturated fat, but typically you'll find mono poly and saturated fat in all different forms of fat. It just very varying amounts. Right. And to some degree it's like, well it's not even really significant. It's such a small amount. I don't know how much of the Salmon Roe were you consuming?

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       It really depends. Like I started to really start to ramp up my consumption. I'm in the third trimester when brain development and just like really getting crazy thinking about this every day. So every day I was putting a big old tablespoon full on top of my avocado. A really third trimester was like, I was like almost everyday trying to consume it, but it was hard for me. The first trimester I was, I started to try a little bit and it made me a little nauseous. Like I know if your kid can read minds when it, it comes out and he's like super brain. Everyone probably is super biased about their own children, but I'm like, he's got great verbal skills and him super smart. You're super smart. Like this, and you're eating all these fish, eggs, kids. This kid said, oh, thank you. It'll be interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:09:13       It can. We can talk to him. He's going to be forced sitting right there. What's funny is he was like early on when he was six weeks old, he was, he went through a really short stage of. He was making sounds that sounded like hello. And so my mom would come over and she would in his face, she would go, hello, hello. And he would. And we have a video of it, like I could send it to you, I'll send it to you. He would go and it like literally seems like he's saying it, but clearly he's not. I mean he's six weeks old, you know? But he was able to sort of mimic the sound because I think it was easier for him since he was already sort of making those sounds. So of course Dan and Ryan and Dan and I were super pumped.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       We're like, he's gonna be a genius. We're sending the video to other family members. You should really listen to what we say. See, oh, that's, of course you know, he's not really saying hello, but making noises, he's making noises. It sounds like it. And it was totally coincidental but was just the difference between like a kid making a noise and a kid knowing what the noise means. Like when they're actually talking to my mom, my seven year old, the seven year old, she didn't really start talking in full sentences until she was like a year and a half, but my, my nine year old, like when she was like nine, 10 months old, she was talking. It was weird. It's like she's really smart. Like she was talking like right away, like, and she was stood up quicker too. She, she was standing at like nine months old, which I found pretty shocking, like an unassisted standing.

Speaker 3:          00:10:44       That's when she wanted to stand in nine months old. She was getting her stand on and I'm trying to take some steps and I was like this crazy, like she's just, she's like, that's how she is as a little person too. She's a little go getter. I often wonder, you know, that the earlier the first borns and the ones that are born earlier, like if they get more attention to, because it's novel here, they're first time parents and then as more children come, you know, it's like you're just, you're, you're spread a little more thin and you know, I mean, it's not necessarily the case, but it's certainly something I've often wondered, you know, if, if we, if I want to have another child, will I be able to do it, you know, it's because I really just wanted. There's so much work that goes into not just, you know, the nutrition part.

Speaker 3:          00:11:31       And I was talking about, you asked me about, you know, things during pregnancy and something I think people don't realize is that, you know, epigenetics, which is basically the transference of, um, it's, it's heritable. Like you can transfer things that happened to you in your lifestyle without actually altering the sequence of DNA. And you can do that by changing how much gene is activated or not activated. And there's been studies, lots and lots of stomach studies in animals showing this to be the case. Of course, that's animals and how much of that actually translates to humans, but there was a really interesting study a couple of years ago, I think it was late 2015 that was published that looked at the effect of obesity and obesity was actually looked at, not in the mothers but the fathers. Um, and so a sperm DNA was collected from, for males that were obese and males that were lean and that there's a variety of different genes like hundreds of different genes that were looked at and about 300 different genes were different in how they were activated or not activated in the sperm Dna of the obese men.

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       And a lot of those genes had to do with cognition, learning, memory and metabolism. So that's very interesting. But what was super interesting was that these men, they were morbidly obese or obese. They underwent bariatric surgery and their sperm DNA was collected, uh, you know, a couple of months after then, like close to a year after. And as time went on, their sperm DNA looked like the lean people. So the, so basically losing the weight, just losing the weight. Had an effect on these genes that are involved in cognition and metabolism. Like I said, you know, lots of animal studies have shown obesity has a negative effect on like, you know, causing type one diabetes later in life and different cognitive disabilities and things like that. So you know, it is something like people that are wanting to conceive my might consider, you know, their, their health before trying to procreate.

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       You know, it's, it's, I'm not saying that, you know, you shouldn't procreate if you're not healthy, but it's just something, you know, another thing to think about and also I think it's a motivating factor for people because sometimes you don't care as much about yourself. I mean some people don't, they're just kinda like, but their child or their unborn child, that's probably, you know, a driver for, for people to make a change like that would certainly hope it would be. I mean, you have this opportunity to really literally changed the way your child develops. And it's just by your discipline, right? Just by whether or not you're taking care of your own body, you can literally change the future of your trial because you're saying that these genes that are in this obese man sperm, the way they're represented that's going to be passed onto the kid versus the lean version of him pass those genes.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       We've passed on to the kid. The kid literally will have a different starting point. Exactly. Different starting point. It's totally crazy. Yeah. I mean, of course the child itself can change things through epigenetics, through their diet and lifestyle, but you're giving them a baseline here, right? I mean, so it's, it's, it's definitely a very, it's a growing field. A lot of the research has done in animals because it's really difficult to do that sort of, these sorts of experiments in humans. But I think that this is sort of a proof of principle at the very least looking at sperm DNA. Um, you know, so it, it's, it's something to consider. And I've had like, like friends of friends that have, you know, that are, that are overweight or obese and wanting to have children. And so it's like, I tried to talk to them about that in a, in a way that's not like condescending, you know, some people, some people do have a hard time, they're trying to lose weight and you know, this, they have to find the right combination of things that works for them.

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       But, um, but I do think that people would get more motivated if they're like, wow, I can, you know, affect my future child risk for type one diabetes or for, you know, like how well what their Iq is, how well they're performing on learning and memory test. So it also avoid the horrific guilt that you would feel if you didn't do that. And you started to see these things manifesting in your child when you realize, oh my God, I sent this kid up in a shitty way because I'm lazy. Which is essentially what a lot of the problem is with people. It's just that they don't have what, whatever. The mental, you know, and people get angry if you say that either they're lazy because they don't die it for. Forget that word. Forget to take away the word Lazy. You're unmotivated will say that, but for whatever reason, if you choose not to take care of your health and you see that transfer into your child and you know that you're unhappy with your existence, you know you're unhappy with your physical body and you refuse to do or for whatever reason don't do enough, and then you see these same problems manifesting in your own baby and you realize like, oh my God, I started this kid off in a shitty way.

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       Like you're going to be riddled with guilt. Totally. I mean, the thing is most people don't know about avid genetics and they don't really know that they're, that they're able to do that. So the more. The more people are educated, I think the better the outcome will be. But like you said, the people that do now and then still do it, it's like, yeah, the guilt. I mean that's like unbelievable. Well, it's like people who smoke when they have a kid, you know, that's, that's so insane. You see people that are pregnant, smoking. I was in, I forget what state it was in, but we were outside this convenience store and there was a lady who was clearly pregnant and she clearly was smoking cigarettes and I was like, fuck man, that's just gross Canada. It was like, this hurts my feelings. Just watching. That just hurts my feelings.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       It doesn't, it just make you sick. Yeah. That's like, you know, and there's all sorts of studies that have shown, you know, of course smoking during pregnancy causes or not causes associated with like Adhd and um, uh, what's it called? Like the movement, just like a, like a dyskinesia thing, you know, all sorts of problems. So it's certainly like I having the knowledge and continuing to read throughout pregnancy. Then once, you know, having the baby, like one thing that I knew that I really, really wanted to do was I wanted to breastfeed. Like that was, you know, like they're, the benefits of breastfeeding are just amazing and this is something that like my, like my stepmother for example, her generation also my, my grandmother, they didn't know about like, so they weren't

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       recommended to breastfeed. You know, back in like the fifties, like it just wasn't, you know, the benefits weren't known, but now we know like breastfeeding, it's kind of amazing. There are something, there's something in breast milk called human milk oligosaccharides. Have you heard of these? Hmo. There's like 200 different of oligos human milk oligosaccharides in breast milk. In fact, it's like the third most common factor in breast milk behind lactose and fat, 200 different ones and they cannot be digested at all by like the infants. I'm digestive system. It's like they co evolved specifically to feed the microbiome in the gut of these infants and they're in there specifically increasing the species of bacteria. I'm bifidobacteria in fantasy is one really, really important one, but it's, it's amazing that they're, it's really, that's the only purpose that they serve is to feed and you know, basically populate the infant gut with this beneficial bacteria and you know, this bacteria has been shown to one setup the immune system because they digest these oligosaccharides and they produce other molecules called short chain fatty acids and those short chain fatty acids like lactate, butyrate, Acetate, things that you've heard of those act as what are called signaling molecules to basically determine what kind of immune cells you're going to make.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       So a big one that they do is they make a t regulatory cells, which are kind of immune cells that prevents autoimmunity, autoimmune responses. So like children that are not, um, that, that are not breastfed, they lack like four different species of, um, of, of gut bacteria and they have like a three, three fold increased risk of allergies and um, you know, autoimmune related diseases. So it's like, it's doing that. And also it's like preventing pathogenic bacteria from, from like taking residents there. Um, because these human milk oligosaccharides, not only are they feeding the beneficial bacteria will recently, it's been found that they like break down biofilms that bacteria create to like, you know, basically escape antimicrobial activity. So there's a lot of antimicrobial things in breast milk like lauric acid, which is also found in coconut oil. Um, but the, the human milk oligosaccharides basically break down the biofilm so that the lord acid can work better.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       So it's like, you know, and their stem cells, there are stem cells in breast milk, mammary stem cells. Like, that blew my mind. I think it's been like 10 years since the discovery of that. But like it's been. So it's that the studies have been mostly done in mice, but they have measured. Humans have the same memory type of stem cells in their breast milk. But in animals and preclinical studies, it's been shown that those, that, those breast stem cells, they get digested. They go into the bloodstream and they go to various organs. They go to the kidney, the liver, the brain, and they start to, like in the pancreas, they start to make like insulin producing cells. Like, it's crazy. Wow. So that's amazing. That's only 10 years ago. They didn't notice. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       It's all happening so fast when it comes to knowledge of nutrition and the effect on the body and especially

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       developing children. Well, the breast milk thing is really what's interesting because once I like, you know, I had my son and you immediately start breastfeeding. Like I had no idea it was going to be so difficult. Like I thought it was just, and maybe it's not difficult for everyone, but I think it's difficult for a lot of women and a lot of women give up after like the first two weeks they give up because you know that it's just for various reasons. It gets, it can be extremely frustrated. You're a new parent, you're getting no sleep and you know, so um, like I, my son had a little bit of a tongue time, right? Like the little thing on underneath his tongue kind of prevented a tongue from moving like as much as it's supposed to. So like he, when he opened his mouth and he'd latch on, there was a little bit of problem.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       So the first two weeks were really hard for me, but that sort of resolved, but I really had to try like my, like Dan and I were, were taking, I was pumping some, some milk and we are putting it in a syringe with a little tube and like putting them on the breast, you know, because I didn't want to introduce the bottle so early. So I mean, and that was hard. I mean, I was getting no sleep. I could totally see if you didn't know all the benefits of breastfeeding that I could, I could see how new mothers would, would give up because it's extremely difficult. So, um, that's something that I completely understand. I understand now. I think previously I was like, how can anyone not press feed, you know, it's so, but it, it really, it's not easy for everyone. There's all sorts of problems that women have, but there are actually breast milk banks that like, so women can donate their breast milk and um, people, you know, can, can buy the breast milk instead of getting formula. Now of course there's all sorts of other problems. It's like, wow, they're getting enough vitamin D and Omega three and what else are they taking? You know,

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       you, there's so many different things that happen once you have children, breast milk, being a breastfeeding, I'm sure being one of them, but the lack of sleep thing, which I think most people just really don't, don't have any idea like what, what is happening and that they also don't understand how difficult it is to watch a child. And right now it's difficult. Wait until the kid starts walking. They start walking around and you have to follow them around. You're literally like walking around with them everywhere they go. I got, don't put that in your mouth. Don't touch that lick that you'll get electrocuted until it's like everywhere you go, it's, it's such a, I don't want to say a project, it's, it's, um, it's just way more difficult in consuming then. And also your protective instincts are ramped up so high. Like my friend Eddie had a cats and rabbits and he's talking about how much he loves his rabbits and he's like, dude, just wait until you have your kid. You're going to want to kill fucking rabbits. He's like, no way, man. I love the cats. I love the rabbits. And as soon as he had the kid, he's like, fuck you, right cats. He goes, my cat wakes up, my kid. I want to kill this fucking cat.

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       It's true. Your protective mechanisms I know changes you. It changes you so much and you know, people that don't have children and who complained about kids that are crying. I used to, used to bother me if I was on a plane and babies are crying, you know, I used to be like, aww baby won't shut up. But now I'm like, Oh, poor little baby. Like literally it doesn't bother me. Like, like someone could be a break right next to me with a crying baby and I feel bad for the baby. It doesn't bother me. Like, damn, his baby won't shut up. It's like a different.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Totally. I, I've started to experience that to some degree in, in various ways as well where it's like you just, Oh, the poor baby. You become a different person. Yeah. You do. You relate to it. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       Yeah, it's, it's, it's the best thing ever. Wow. I mean, it creates so much empathy. I mean, it just changed my whole perspective of what a person is, is different. Uh, my, my idea of a person used to be a static form like Jamie's 35, 35, 34. Like I would say, God, that's 34 year old Jamie. That's who he is. I never thought, oh, Jamie was a baby. Like Jamie used to be a four year old. Like Jamie went to preschool. Jamie went to kindergarten there. I never thought about it that way. I'd be like, oh, there's Jamie. Hey, what's up Jamie? Jamie's always been Jamie. You know, that's like how I used to look at people. Now we're looking at everybody as a baby. I called, that's a baby that became a grown man. Like that's how I look at everyone now. It's so, it's, it's weird. It's like a paradigm shift happened in my brain. That is, that's, that's definitely weird. It made me way more compassionate. Way, way nicer to people, which is way I just, I think I don't want anybody's life to fall apart anymore. I used to like, quieter. I hope that guy gets hit by a truck, you know? Now I'm like, man, I hope that little baby figures out why he's such an asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       Interesting to kind of see the brain activation pathways that change. Like, you know, if you're talking about being more compassionate, that's almost like, I mean there's a certain type of meditation, like the compassion meditation that people do that changes like certain parts of the brain. It kind of interesting to see my, like Dan thinks that I've gotten more creative because I make up all these like mommy games and mommy songs. Just like I never was really a super, super creative person. I'm more analytical, you know, I've got, I definitely have some creativity, but like he, he's kind of like, I wonder if just like becoming a mommy, like you just all of a sudden become more creative, you know? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff going on. I mean, your brain just gets activated. It. I do stuff with my seven year old sometimes and half the time we're doing stuff I'm like, I can't even believe you're real. Like I'm having these little conversations with her were playing little games and you know, like we play this really stupid game. It's so dumb. So you spin this thing and it's like, it corresponds to a different color acorns and you know, and when she wins and she jumps up, she like,

Speaker 4:          00:26:43       oh I beat you. And she's like doing her little dance and she's like throwing her arms in the. And I'm like, this is like half of me is laughing because she's funny, but half of me is going, this is so strange that you're a little person that I'm talking to. Like you, you were a baby and now you're this little seven year old playing this game with me. It's like, it's so odd. I feel that way with my four month old. I see little personality things already kind of creeping up and it's like, that's amazing. So I can only imagine like as he continues to develop and that's why it's very. I think it's very difficult for people that don't have children to sort of develop that same level of compassionate. It sounds like a cop out. It sounds like it sounds weird, but I really do.

Speaker 4:          00:27:24       I think there's something, there's actually something to be gained and as far as like everyone reproducing. Well obviously we have too many people, so that's not. I don't know if that's the best thing. I certainly think that you could be a fully formed, healthy, wonderful person who contributes an amazing thing to the world if you don't have children. I don't think you have to have children, but I think for me it was, it was very much. There was a, there was a giant learning experience along with it. There's a giant evolving experience along with just being a parent. It was, something happened to me. It's, it's, it's absolutely life changing, you know? Um, it's, I, I had no idea. Like I've always heard people say that the best thing that happened to me, it truly is. It truly is the best thing. And, uh, so, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm excited to, to continue to see how it changes me and it just unfortunately corresponds with a lot of financial stress with a lot of people, time, stress, financial stress, last lack of sleep and sometimes they just don't appreciate it, you know, just you're so overwhelmed by the burden of just trying to get by that sometimes you can't appreciate this amazing moment that happened in front of you and it's, you know, it's hard, it's hard to, it's hard to have a good perspective and it's hard.

Speaker 4:          00:28:37       It's hard to like be able to see things from above, like to sort of rise above and look at the big picture of this thing. And that's, for me, something that really helps with that is, is exercise. Sure. I think that also, you know, I didn't have any postpartum depression, at least I think I didn't. I mean I think there's a variety of factors. I mean, so for one, you know, your, um, during pregnancy, your estrogen levels, like they, like they go through the roof. I mean it's like 100 fold higher and undertold something like that. Like it's really high compared to your baseline, and don't quote me, I'm going to be something I'm thinking something like that, like I've just orders and orders of magnitude higher and estrogen and has been shown to increase the expression of a gene called Tryptophan hydroxylase to in the brain that produces serotonin from tryptophan. So you're constantly making serotonin constantly, constantly, constantly. And then, you know, after you have the baby that goes away. So it's Kinda like

Speaker 3:          00:29:43       a withdrawal. So that's sort of one biochemical explanation. But there are many others. One, I think your circadian rhythm is off. You're not, you're not getting enough light because you're like nasty, like you. Like, I don't think we left. I mean, I don't even remember going outside for like two weeks maybe. Yeah. It was like, you know, especially with the difficult breastfeeding part. So it was like you're constantly inside. You're not getting that bright light exposure. Your sleep is completely disrupted. So your circadian rhythm, which is, you know, extremely, extremely important for, for mood, for the way you feel, uh, that is completely disrupted because you're, you're waking up, you know, multiple times a night and that's completely gone. Um, and uh, and it's stressful. It's like completely new experience. You have this very fragile baby, you know, that you're responsible for. And so I think that combination of all these things really can play a role in that.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       Uh, and for me, I, I really tried to make sure I was getting exercise as soon as I could, you know, so that is something because exercise for a variety of reasons, one, it's been shown to increase the production of Serotonin by getting transport of Tryptophan into the brain. So branched chain amino acids which are found in a variety of, of um, proteins, uh, they can outcompete trip to fan and to get into the brain. And so if you're not exercising, you're constantly getting the branch chain amino acids in the brain which are serving other important roles, but you're not getting that trip to fan. So you're not getting the precursor to make serotonin. And so the exercise alleviates that, that competition, branch chain amino acids get taken up into your muscle where they're, you know, they're used to help build muscle which is good.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       And the Japan gets into the brain. So you're making Serotonin, that's one. Two, you're making, um, you know, endorphins, a Beta endorphins help so that, that's another thing. And then the, you're, you're increasing the production of new neurons through Serotonin also through brain drive neurotrophic factor that also has been shown to help alleviate depression and, and prevent depression. The actual neurogenesis, the thing that helps you to stave off brain aging, which by the way, there's been like, there was like 14 clinical trials that have been analyzed on looking at humans that, that undergo like a real big exercise and how they have like their left part of their hippocampus doesn't like atrophy. Like people who do not exercise, you know. So that's like because the neurogenesis, but that, that's another reason you can visually see it atrophy you some sort of animal products. Have you ever looked, if you like google, like Alzheimer's Disease Brain, like there's, there's even images all over the place where they show like before and after and there's just like big holes in the brain. I mean it's just like, it's like because someone was comparing it to a football player was, what's the guy's name who fell off the car? The guy was Henry, Chris and Chris Henry. He was, um, I think he was only 28,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       right? Twenty six. He was a young man who was an nfl football player. No one had any idea he had cte. This is like a earlier, understandably, this is like seven years ago, somewhere around there. Right. I'm much less understanding about the effects of cte and he had some sort of an altercation with his girlfriend, chased after her. She was, she jumped in a car and he didn't want her to leave. So he jumped on top of the truck to try to hang on and fell off the truck and killed himself. Um, yeah. So they do an autopsy on him and they find out that he has a brain of a 70 year old man with Alzheimer's. Well and he's 28, 26, 28, whatever it was. He was young under 30 and super athlete just and they were stunned and they looked at his brain and they're like, well this is, this is, this doesn't even make sense and now they're finding that this is the case with so many football players.

Speaker 2:          00:33:34       Just when you, you, when you went to see the UFC, when you and Dan with the see the UFC and I talked to you afterwards, we all went to dinner afterwards and you, your eyes were as big as dinner plates and you were like, this is so bad. So many bad things are happening. And then you started going into detail about the various things that were happening. It was so fascinating to watch you a scientist. Watch people get head kicked and punched in the face and watch. Watch mma take place. Yeah, I mean it's, it's kind of crazy to think about how people will like as a profession go and get, like they're getting Tbi, like constantly getting their head and you know, there, there are, there's definitely like if you look at the non, you know, fighting forms, martial arts where there like it, it seems a lot more beautiful like cool moves and stuff, you know, but like, like the actual like getting your head bashed and stuff like that's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       It's so crazy, you know, and I understand money is a big driving factor because they probably make a lot of money but you know, what, what, what's it worth when you're not able to enjoy it when you're older and you just lose your brain. It's not just money, it's the excitement of it. The way I describe it is it's high level problem solving with dire physical consequences, high level problem solving. That's what fighting is like you have a skillset. I have a skill set, like we're playing a game and the game is I want to try to hit you with my bones and you're trying to hit me with your bones. And we're trying to figure out who's better at it and I know that you know what I know you, you like if you get to a certain level, like say what are. One of the things that I love about Jujitsu is a Jujitsu sort of solve this, but it does.

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       So without hitting each other. Jujitsu is all grappling and there's obviously a lot of injuries that come through from Jujitsu. I think that's what I meant when I, when I was using something that looks kind of cool. Yeah. I like the world you just do. Championships just happened this past weekend. I was watching some of the videos online and you watch these really high level guys going after it and it's, it's amazing is beautiful. They're attacking and counter attacking and you just. And me in my mind, I'm thinking of the countless hours of dedication and focus. It's required to reach this level of proficiency where they're just, they know what to do and when to do. Trying to counter and they know and they're both black belts at a very high level. So it's like you're, you're, you're examining this game. And it doesn't have the same feeling when someone loses that an mma fight has, like, I watched the UFC this past weekend and there's some brutal knockouts and when you watch someone get caseload and you see their, their brain shut off, their leg stiffened up and they'd go flat.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       I saw, I saw someone get knocked out, I forgot who it was, but it was like one of the last, like most exciting fights. And it was like he, it was, it was crazy. Yeah, for sure. And, and I think we talked about this last time a couple years ago, but the apoe e four gene I think really is something that would at least give some insight because I mean it's known that people that have at least one of those gene, that gene, they can have really, really bad consequences if they get Tbi. I mean we're talking 10 to 20 fold more risk for Cte for other 20 fold more if they have. Yeah. If they have two copies of it. So they're like homozygous, which is a lot less common. One copy is more common. That would be, um, you know, anywhere like a, like a two to five fold, but when you have two copies it can be, it can be up 10 to 20 fold higher.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       So that's something that's like, you know, with, with the, with the MMA, the UFC kind of fighting, I mean, or football or boxing or you know, fill in the blank sports that you know, is very, um, has a high risk for, for Tbi. Like I think that's something that athletes should consider and, and you probably would find ones that would say, hey, maybe I shouldn't do this, you know, especially with football players, know quite a few football players who are aware of this are actually backing out of the NFL at a very young age. I think headaches. So there was a guy recently was 24 years old, just retired and he's like, I'm done. Yeah. You know, when he has a bright future apparently. Well let's do it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       We got sidetracked. So you were talking about exercise and the um,

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       what put the hippocampus. Oh yeah. Yeah. So the, the, the benefits of exercise on the brain, which I know that I constantly talk about this to you because it, but it's just so, you know, it's so damn important. It's so important, so important. And it is, it's one of those things that like, it helps me with everything with the brain. Aging is like, it's like it's the longterm effect. So it helps me with the short term which is like handling life and handling stress. You were talking about how people have a hard time seeing things from a higher level and, and it's so true, you know, because life is hard, you know, you have to like make it, you have to survive and if you don't have a starting place, a starting, if your baseline is, is kind of like you don't have a lot to start with and you have to work all, you know, all the more work you have to put in.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       So I think that, you know, getting distracted with trying to make money, you're trying to like survive and try to look, you know, try to like live a good life and get married and have kids and all this. It can be really stressful. So, you know, I have of course my own stresses, but I think that the exercises, the short, the short term effects I get from that, you know, are helping with clarity. Helping me with, um, being able to kind of take, take a step back and not be so anxious. And there's, there's controlled trials showing this as well with, with exercise. Um, you know, I, for the longest time have been a runner and running is like, for me, you know, I love the, the frame of mind I'm in when I'm running, like it's kind of like this reflective daydreaming, which some people in some studies say, well Jay dreaming is not good because you're ruminating when you're daydreaming.

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       But I think the daydreaming that you do when you're like running is a lot different from like if you and I are having this conversation right now, but I wasn't present. Right. So that's called rumination and that that's like, that's a stressful kind of. Yeah. Where you're, where you're not present because you're worried about this other thing you have to do. Right. But the, the daydreaming effect when I'm running is a little bit more of a reflective. Like it's a good. It's like a cleansing for me. So I've always. When you run. Yeah. I saw that you've recently gotten into that, which is over the past year. The literally last January started because a friend of mine how to run a in, in Vegas. So five. I jumped in it with zero running at all. I'm like, God, this is fucking hard. I was like, I'm in shape.

Speaker 3:          00:40:19       I'll just go run. But I never ran. I literally never. Now I run every week and it was hard for you, right, because you're right part. But what's interesting is my cardio for everything else has gone through the roof. It's because I'm running like brutal trails, like really steep mountain trails and I'm doing the most. It was four miles. The least I do is one mile. Sometimes I do too, but it's, it's essentially hill sprints. Okay. So you're doing something, you're getting some high intensity in there, you're sprinting. It's very high intensity and it's all, it's all like really extensive cardio. It's like it's heavy duty stuff. I run with my dog now. That's awesome. So what's interesting is for me, um, after pregnancy, like I couldn't wait to go out running and so I think it was four weeks in four weeks, four weeks postpartum.

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       I went out for a run. I saw your instagram post. Yeah. Okay. So I went out for a run. I was super extreme. That's probably the only post I did because what I found out as I was running is I didn't feel so great. Like I felt like my bladder felt full even though it wasn't like. And so I would, I would stop and go to the bathroom, like on my run and then I was like, okay, and then run again. It still felt full and I was like, this is not normal like this, you know, so um, so I went to my ob Gyn, talked to him and apparently your pelvic floor, like changes

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       after having a baby and that can like, you know, fall down and kind of hit your bladder a little. And so it feels, some women actually like pee urinate when they're running. Like I never had it like that. Well he looked at my pelvic floor was like on a scale from zero to 10, zero being the best, your one. And I'm like, really? Because I feel like a seven, you know? And so he was like, well you probably shouldn't have started running so soon, so don't do that. Why don't you start doing some low impact exercise and start doing these like strength, like strengthening your pelvic floor with like key goals and some core strength, which I've been doing so. So I was like, crap, what am I going to do? Like running. I would just walk out the door and go, you know, run.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       And that was like my escape. So I started doing this. The cycling class, high intensity interval cycling class, which is, it's an hour long and it's a spin class but it's not like the dance spin, so it's the, it's, it's a spin class where you do hills and sprints and it's, it's an hour long, but you're mixing it with just a robotic and so you get these sprints and these hills and I really, really, really like it for multiple reasons. One is the group setting where I feel like the people around me and like they're still going at it, you know, so it's like motivating. So I keep going to. There's something about that group that really like I push. If it were just me on that bike for an hour, there's no way I would be pushing it. Like I do, like I am pushing it. It's like amazing pushing it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       I feel that way about yoga class.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       Yeah. For the growth is everyone's sort of feeding off each other. Right, right, right. And then also having the instructor, like there's a couple instructors that I really, really like and you know, because they liked their style and they're kind of more like coaches and then the kind of instructor that kind of makes you want to feel there's an instructor that's like, they their cheerleader kind of want to make you feel good. And then there's the instructor where they're like a coach where they're like the trying to help you get better. So this icon does high intensity, high intensity interval training. And I've never really been into it that much. Like I was, you know, I would do some like jump squats and things like that, like at home, but this is the first time I'm like really it's structured environment and really doing it. So I started reading about it, like wanting to know because that's how I am. If I do something I'm like well I'm going to look into it. And either it will motivate me to like really keep it up and do it more or I'll be like, no, this isn't good, you know? So I started reading more and more about it. And it's amazing the benefits of the high intensity. So you were talking about how, how your, your, I think what you were describing was your aerobic capacity

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       change for the big one. Is kickboxing like the when when I hit the bag, he used to be that I would, I would struggle to do a three minute round of, of high, high intensity, like hitting the bag kickboxing. But now I can, I get through it, the bell goes off and I'm like, really? Okay. Like the bell just went off. All right, that's three minutes. And then I'll have the 32nd rest by the term. 30 second rest is up. I'm fully recovered and I'm back in again. I just, it's, I mean like I have more than double

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       the endurance stay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       So. So they're, they're. What you're experiencing has been studied in clinical studies. Basically this aerobic capacity also people call it a vo two Max, which is basically the ability of your lungs and your blood and your heart to carry oxygen to your muscles are places that are, you know, during that intense push. So the capacity to do that. Right? Well as we age, over the age of 25, once we hit 25 and we continue on, our aerobic capacity decreases by 10 percent per decade. So like one percent per year. Right. So you're basically, you know, 25 year 35, your, your vo two Max. Your is like 10 percent less than you were when you were 25. Well it turns out doing these high intensity interval classes during 24 of them, which in this study it was like there were 40 minutes long and there was four four minute pushes and then there's, you know, recoveries in between and all that, blah blah blah stuff they were able to improve.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       And after eight weeks of doing 24 high intensity classes improve their vo two Max by like 12 percent. So you're basically adding a decade, you know, back to your point. Many weeks. Well they did it. They did 24 classes of this in eight weeks. Wow. So what the interesting thing about that study was they were also testing whether or not like, like I'm doing it, I think it was like four weeks or something really like short, just packing them all in the actually didn't increase the vo two Max as much because the recovery time was actually important.

Speaker 5:          00:45:57       It's actually changed the way I think about when it comes to training and my advice that I give to people for training because I used to think that it was adequate to just do the sports specific workouts like say if you wanted to get better at Jujitsu, just do Jujitsu. Do you want to get better at kickboxing? Just to your kickboxing. The cardio you get from that will be enough. I don't think that's the case anymore because I'm stunned at how much of an increase in cardio that I've gotten from these hill sprints and now I realize like, okay, what you can do is you can do it independently of that work and it doesn't really mess with that work. Like say if I run in the morning and I get a good two mile run, I can still hit the bag at three in the afternoon, but the difference will be is I like, my legs will be tired from running, but they're not the same muscles that I use when I kick box. But what's similar in a lot of ways, but with what's really changing for sure is that my aerobic capacity is just way bigger.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       It's just awesome. It's just different. That's actually a marker of aging aerobic capacity. Vo Two Max. I've never actually measured my own vo two Max. Um, I probably have to put that hosting. I don't want to do it because now that I'm doing all this high intensity work and I'm totally going to stick with it. Like I love it, but I definitely want to get back to the running and I've been sort of worried about I can only do so much as a new mom and working on a trip. Would you be interested in a treadmill or. No? You know, I love running outside like in nature, whether it's in the beach or I'm like in the hills, rolling hills and stuff, but you know, for

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       the longest time I lived in Tennessee and the weather there is not great and so I did do treadmill running and so yeah, I definitely, I don't, I don't have the same daydreaming like effect that I, but I do definitely. I mean it's definitely good and I get a lot from it from a treadmill, but there's something about, in fact there was some interesting study that I don't know how long ago, maybe a year ago or two that looked at people that exercise, I think they went for like walks or something in nature versus like in the metropolitan area and the benefits there was, there was more benefits in going for walks in nature in terms of like, you know, psychological benefits, but also some of the variety of like biomarkers that were measured. So it kind of interesting. You know, it is interesting.

Speaker 5:          00:48:20       I think we like to think of ourselves as being detached from what we experienced just in terms of even just visually, but I, I think that those things have an effect on not just how you think, like how you feel, but who you are. I mean, I, I think we are, we have some sort of a symbiotic relationship with our environment and when your environment is cement in glass and concrete and rubber and all the things that we've created in cities that there's a dull feeling that you get from those things and then when you, you can go and see a green meadow and birds flying around and, and the, the wind whistling through the leaves like you, you just, it does something to your body does something, not just your mind. There's something going on like you, you, you have like this feeling of, Oh, this is medicine. This is, I'm getting something out of this.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       Yeah, absolutely. I think that there's the noise pollution, the sound, you know, like the cars and all that. That's been shown to have a negative effect on people's emotions. And, and I'm in, of course, there's the environmental things, you're breathing in pollution and that has been shown to increase inflammatory biomarkers and all that. But there's certainly, I think the just going out into nature and you, you, you feel better. You Do, you definitely, you definitely feel better. It's not, you know, not I live in the city and I live off of a busy place and thankfully we're going to be moving. But that's something I'm considering where it's just like, are you moving specifically for that reason? No, we're just in a small apartment right now and it's like I have a baby now and it's fun to people. Yeah, it was fine. It was close to the beach and you know, it was, it's fun like, but just, it's not something that, that, you know, I could do with, with, with the baby, especially in such a small space. And there's motorcycles that go by and it's like, it's crazy. Like the motorcycles that they wrap up their writing by exactly the writing by and it's like that's a bummer. It's, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:50:19       to now. So I'm also like a yard is good for a kid. Right, right,

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       exactly. But it's hard. It's hard in, you know, I mean

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       like we were saying, you know, it's not easy, so there's things you have, there's just all this stuff you have to consider when you're, your priorities changed now, now that you, when you have a child, it's like you've got to think of all the things schools and this and that neighbors and who were they going to be friends with and like, oh my God,

Speaker 5:          00:50:44       before I forget, I wanted to tell people, go to Chris Kresser, his instagram or his, excuse me, his twitter page, and there's an article on Acetaminophen and women who are pregnant consuming Acetaminophen and the negative consequences it has for children. See more evidence. It says here that the exposure to Acetaminophen may be a part of adhd puzzle. A Norwegian study, pregnant women took Acetaminophen for 29 days or more, had a more than twofold risk of having children with Adhd.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       Yeah. Wow. Tylenol, I think I've seen. I think I even tweeted something like this like a couple of years ago where this isn't the first study where in New York Times right now apparently, and that's what people are prescribed right during pregnancy.

Speaker 5:          00:51:29       Scary Shit. There's, I mean it's how many things we find out from like the 19 sixties were terribly detrimental to children and doctors are telling you this is the way you should go. I mean there's.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       So that's the, you know, with, um, when I was pregnant there was, there were certainly some things that I opted out of that we're probably more standard of care, you know, so, uh, just because of concern and, and not that I knew for a fact that something was gonna happen, but I had doubt and that was enough for me to sort of weigh the benefits and the risks. And I was like, well, you know, so.

Speaker 5:          00:52:08       Well there's even talk about vaccination protocols. Like not whether or not, I mean, I'm not an anti vaccination person. I think vaccinations are important, but I think that there's a lot of merit in the idea of that. You shoot a kid up at 36 different shots when they're six weeks old or whatever age they start them out right out of the box. They give a lot of doctors want to give your kid a series of shots and that there's some, there's some concern that the actual consequences of all these different vaccines being put into your child's body very early and a large number of them have some sort of negative consequences.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       It, you know, I'm, I'm with you. Like I'm also not an antibody or I think vaccines are important. I'm going to vaccinate my son. But um, and I've, I've already given. I'm a little behind on the schedule. I've given him one. But. So what you're saying is true there is like even on the CDC website, it says that, you know, some of these vaccines can cause I'm fevers and epileptic seizures, seizures, seizures in infants and, but that there's no longterm consequence of that. And, and that's kind of like, you know, if you look, if you look at the literature and, and how the immune, the immune system response to some of these vaccines, especially if you're giving like five at once. I mean the first round of vaccines that I'm supposed to do, it was like, it was like five different vaccines. And so what I'm opting to do is actually do them in singles where you.

Speaker 1:          00:53:38       So yeah, because it's like why the immune response is, you know, kind of the thing that's scary and you don't really know how a child's immune system is going to react. And there are studies. I was particularly worried about it during pregnancy and that's when one of the things I opted out of was getting, um, the td APP, a vaccine, which is they want to give it to you when you're, I forgot how many weeks pregnant. I'm 30 something I think. And uh, to protect basically pass on antibodies for whooping cough, you know, to the, to the baby. And so I opted out and I said I would do it post basically postpartum, like one day postpartum because it takes about four weeks to transfer the antibodies in breast milk. So I still was gonna, you know, get the vaccine. But I was going to do it after I had the.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       And the. And the reason I made that decision is because there have been multiple studies now in nonhuman primates that have looked on these studies, came out of UC Davis, looked at pregnant female monkeys on when they're, when they have a really strong immune response. So like a strong infection or you know, who knows a vaccine. The study didn't use vaccines, but I'm sort of drawing a parallel here. Whereas just the immune response having very strong immune response. There was an autoimmune response that ended up having antibodies that attack the developing brain. And the monkeys that were born from those mothers were had autistic like behaviors. It's been shown in humans that mothers of autistic children are five times more likely to have antibodies floating around in their blood against fetal brain proteins. Like they're not supposed to have antibodies against fetal brain proteins in their blood.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       So there's definitely been some link with the immune system and autoimmunity, particularly during pregnancy and autism risk. Now, in terms of like the, the young baby, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm scared too. And I do. I do worry that, you know, my, my son's developing so great and like I don't want to do something wrong. It's, it's scary. It really is. And you know, I definitely, like I said, I'm going to vaccinate my son and I have been doing singles and that you have to like, it's, it's a little more inconvenient because you have to go to the doctor like so many times to do it. But the thing is is that when you don't, when you're not giving so many different vaccines at once, the immune response isn't going to be as strong.

Speaker 5:          00:55:56       And there's a problem with this conversation and one of the problems with this conversation is as soon as you talk about vaccines, you immediately get lumped into a bunch of fucking crazy people that think that vaccines or some sort of a conspiracy. And the government's trying to make money from you and you were an anti-vaxxer and they immediately box you in and start getting angry at you. It's, it's, it's almost, it's a weird thing because you're talking about chemicals that you're injecting into a child, right? Yeah, but still people are very hesitant to, to even look at that. They're very, they'll you want to automatically just go with whatever the doctor says when it comes to vaccines until. But the real problem is until you look at like how much work has been done, determining what the consequences are and how can you find out?

Speaker 5:          00:56:43       How can you even know? No, you really can't unless you have to have the exact, you know, a bunch of copies. You make a bunch of clowns have a baby and you expose them to the exact same environment. Zach, exact same epigenetics, exact same environmental factors and then one of you and inject a bunch of chemicals into and one you don't. I mean we know that vaccines are amazing. They have prevented polio. They have prevented a host of different diseases becoming real issues and we know that people who don't vaccinate their kids, the the reason why measles are coming back, they might just. There's real concerns. Absolutely. I think vaccines are amazing. I'm so happy they exist, but I also think that we have to be very careful with just jumping into things. Just like we were talking before about things that they did as standard care during the 19 sixties are now prohibited. Like we know they're dangerous for you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       Yeah. Yeah. I mean I, I completely 100 percent agree and I think that there, there, there are now it's a growing field at least in science where there are, there are scientists that are trying to understand the, the gene interaction, that gene interaction with the immune system because it obviously almost everyone gets vaccinated, right? I mean, and you don't have everyone walking around with all these with autism and all this, but there, there is something that is going on and you know, a lot of parents have noticed changes of course after the vaccinations. And so there, there is a new field of inquiry. I do know that's ongoing. We're scientists are beginning to now look at, in addition to how the immune system is reacting to some of these vaccines, how specific genes, you know, regulating certain immune functions may differences in those genes called polymorphisms may predispose a child. Now how are you going to know that? Like without doing a DNA test before you do the vaccine? I mean it's a risk, like you said, how do you know it's it. It definitely is a risk and that's, that's what's the scary thing, you know, and it's like, you know, it's, it's a, it's a dilemma that I've been facing and, and you know, I, I'm currently, the reason I even delayed, I've only given my son to vaccines so far, but just because I'm trying to like exhaustively read the literature as much as I can.

Speaker 5:          00:58:57       Well good. I'm glad. I'm glad that you're looking at it this way because it's something that there's a lot of pressure on people to not look at it that way. There's like this just having this conversation, Joe Rogan and Rhonda Patrick are anti-vaxxers. That could be, that could be the title of some bullshit arc article that someone writes about this. I mean I've seen it time and time again where someone will write a clickbait title to an article and then someone will just that and go, oh,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       you're an anti-vaxxer. Of course you are, you loser, and they'll get angry at you and throw some twitter message your way. That is not representative of your actual thoughts on this at all. This is a very complex, very nuanced issue and like, like I said, I do think people should vaccinate their children. Do as well. Have been all right. I. I agree. It's a nuanced topic that we, you know, we don't. We don't know what the answer to. I mean I think that this guy, what was his name? The guy, the doctor that got disbarred because he liked falsified some data on a thumb Rosalda mercury and causing autism. Falsified some data or something. What was the story behind that data that was published that, that linked thimerosal, which is the agile that was found in a lot of vaccines in California. They don't use that as far as I know, as far as like it's not used anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       Was that the needle, measles, mumps, rubella, MMR, you know? Yeah. And so what did he do? What was, I don't you know, it's not like I haven't done super, super in depth analysis of what he did to my understanding was that he just hold it up here. Journal retracts 1998 paper linking autism to vaccines are prominent. British medical journal Tuesday, retracted in 1998 research paper that set off a sharp decline of vaccinations in Britain after the papers. Lead. Author suggested that vaccines could cause autism, the retraction, blah, blah, blah. Reassessment, uh, there's lasted for years, uh, in the scientific methods and financial conflicts. Dr Andrew Wakefield, who contended that his research show that the combined measles, mumps, and rubella rubella. How do you say it? Rubella. Rubella vaccine may be unsafe, but the retraction may do little to tarnish Dr Wakefield's fields, reputation among parents groups in the United States, despite a wealth of scientific studies that have failed to find any link between vaccines and autism, the parents fervently.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       I love that word, believe that their children's medical problems resulted from vaccines. I know a lot of people that think their kid's medical issues came from vaccines and I'm not wanting to tell them they're wrong. I don't know who's right or who's wrong, but I know there's a massive amount of money to discourage any sort of talk and thinking that no one wants you to think there's anything wrong with vaccines and vaccines can do no harm, but you know, millions of dollars have been given out by the vaccine courts. It's not like there's. There's vaccine courts that take care of cases where people have been damaged by vaccines. It's not. There's no way. We were talking about this before the podcast started that we're going to discuss the, the. There's people very biologically, so much that one person can eat at my friend Brian, his, his mom, if she eats a Brazil nut, she will die.

Speaker 5:          01:02:21       I could eat a whole bowl of those boring fucking nuts. They don't do anything to me. I think they're boring but increase your selenium. Oh, that's nice. It's good to have, but I mean they don't do anything negative to me, but his mom will eat them and she dies. Now that you can, I believe that you can extrapolate that and you can look at all sorts of different things that you take into your body. There are some people that are allergic to a host of different things that don't do a damn thing to me and there's going to be people that are going to have reactions to vaccines. It's just it's a chemical. There's going to be something that happens in your body, so the idea that there's no link whatsoever to a chemical causing an adverse reaction. That doesn't jive. It doesn't make sense to say that it's impossible. You could say it's extremely rare. That makes more sense, but when they say there's no link, when you say no link, I have to go, what's motivating this? What's motivating you to say no link? Because with when you're dealing with chemicals, there's always going to be a small percentage of a chance that your body has an adverse reaction. Those chemicals,

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       and it's not just chemicals. I mean, this is, these are, these are live bacteria, bacteria and you're listening and immune response and immune response is very as well, dramatically. I mean some people have autoimmune disease diseases because their immune system gets so ramped up. I mean, you know, some people have type one diabetes because their immune system is destroying their pancreatic Beta islet cells that produce insulin. People are different like you said, and it's funny because when that, when Jamie pulled that up, my mind went to the same place where it's, it's just, it's the perfect example of how people respond differently to different things and you know, it's not, it's not just a chemical but food, and this is a big, big field of inquiry is like the food because you've got people battling just like with the vaccine, people that are anti-vaxxers versus people that want to vaccinate.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       You've got people that are saying saturated fat is bad. It's good proteins bad. No, it's good. You've got all these camps of people that all you know are just basically like. It's almost like a religion where they just, they know what the best diet isn't. Everyone should do it. And, and the reality is, is that it may not be the best diet for everyone, you know, and that's something that we all very. Yeah, I mean that's something, you know, so, so before the industrialized civilization occur, like occurred, food was like, the food you would eat was, you know, according to where you live geographically, right? Because you weren't getting food from all parts of the world, like you were basically were at whatever you could grow and that part of the world is what you would eat. Right? And so like people would eat carbohydrates or fats saturated fats or you know, various foods, you know, different at different rates because they were, you know, that's what they had, right?

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       And it's thought that, you know, uh, over over time that humans have adapted to the, to the region and they've adapted so that they could process, you know, basically processed that food better. And at least that's the theory. The reality is it doesn't matter how it happened. We know that it's true when people have different variations in genes that are involved in nutrition and also in everything else. So regardless of whether or not that's how it actually occurred, it, it happens. And I think one of the best examples of that is the study that was published in 2015 in the journal cell from the Weizmann Institute. 800 different people were given a continuous glucose monitor where their blood glucose levels were measured every five minutes. And these people were then, um, they submitted samples, uh, for their, for their DNA to be analyzed. And then also their microbiome, which is the bacteria that live in the gut.

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       And so scientists then gave these groups of people various food types, either refined carbohydrate like white bread, complex carbohydrates, like, you know, like a banana, and then saturated fat like cheese. And they measured people's Glucose response to these various foods, 800 different people. And what was found was that the glucose response varied vastly according to a person's genetic and also microbiome makeup. So people, you would think, well, people are going to have a high blood glucose response to white bread and maybe maybe somewhat to the banana, but there's fiber in there. And that sort of changes the way, you know, the, the glucose levels, um, uh, reach the blood. But the reality was that some people had high blood glucose to the saturated fat, which is sort of, you know, not people don't think about that. I'm so that this is, this was sort of like one of the first proof of principle studies showing and 800 different people that people are different and they measured the various genes to show it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       And also their microbiome, the gut bacteria varied as well because that changes the way you're metabolizing food. So, um, some of these genes, like we know, we know for example, Ppr, Alpha, Ppr, Gamma Fto, April before, which is what I have all changed the way your body metabolizes fat and also the way your body transports like fatty acids and cholesterol throughout the body. And the people with some of these polymorphisms in these genes, if they eat a high, you know, saturated to low poly and mono unsaturated fat ratio, they can actually have more adverse effects. They can have higher blood glucose, they can have higher ldl cholesterol, they can have higher obesity rates, higher type two diabetes risk, you know, so, and that's like, like I said, that's, that's something that most people that were, that would eat a high saturated fat diet wouldn't have. And so I've actually been able to look at some of my jeans because there's companies now that allow you to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:51       And um, so, you know, I know that I have in April before, so that changes my, my diet in a way so you know, it because the Aicpa we for not only predisposes you to Alzheimer's disease, um, and also from um, adverse effects to Tbi, but it also affects the way cholesterol is transporting your body and it doesn't get recycled very well. So I have more cholesterol circulating in my body at any given point, um, compared to my husband Dan, who doesn't have an APP for a little and we eat the exact same diet, like my ldl will be like 20 points higher than his, you know, like is there a negative health effect of that? So that it gets a little more complicated, but um, so the, the, the ldl cholesterol by the way, for a long time it's been, it's been thought to be a predictor of heart disease because with nutrition, and here's the thing with nutrition is, is that a lot of our studies are, are, are what's called observational studies where we look at this population and we look at a disease risk and we say, oh, this person eat that and they have a higher risk of that or a low risk or that.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       Right? So it's a correlation. It's not, you're not, you're not showing it's a causal factor, right. It's a correlation. And it's notoriously like, actually my mentor from my Postdoc, Dr Bruce Ames, he has this joke, that analogy of. It's a joke that he tells that really illustrates this type of study. Epidemiology. It's, it's. He says that people that are born in Miami are born Hispanic, but they died Jewish. So you're born Hispanics and if you don't know the rich cultural history of Miami, whereas a lot of big Latino community people come there from Cuba and various races, but then old people go there to retire because they hate the cold and they want to like, you know, you know, movement move to Florida. So you just look at the data. If you just look at the birth records and the death records, you'd be like, oh, people are born Hispanic and they die Jewish. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       That is epidemiology. That's like, that's very funny. It is. And it's, it's a great analogy because it really does highlight the complexity of doing these types of studies. There's all sorts of other factors that play a role, right? I mean so. So the thing is is that with nutrition in particular, you have to look at not just the epidemiological study, but you have to look at controlled randomized controlled trials where they use biomarkers as predictors of certain diseases. You have to look at animal studies where mechanism has done to understand how things are working. You know, you have to look at the whole picture because if you just use these studies were, oh, you get a low protein diet, it's, you have a lower all cause mortality, boom, I'm going to be a Vegan. Well guess what? Lots of other things are complicated. You know, there's, there's lots of other factors or the saturated fat one.

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       So you asked me, does ldl like, does that predict your heart disease risk? Well on a population level for a long time it can. Because LDL LDL is, you know, one thing that transports cholesterol and higher levels of it have been associated with a variety of different heart disease risk factors. But the thing is is that as you know, as time has gone on and tools have got better and when we're able to like look more at mechanism, scientists have now started to uncover, oh, there's multiple types of ldl. It's not just one type. There's different sizes of it that are circulating in the blood and one size

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       is really good. The large size, the large buoyant size, it's really good because it's delivering cholesterol to yourselves and delivering fatty acids to yourself where you need it. Every time you make a new cell in your body, guess what? It needs cholesterol and these fatty acids, that's great. But there's also smaller sizes that, that, um, that are more dense and basically they can't get recycled back to the liver. There's a, there's a, uh, basically a, a life cycle of the cholesterol. It's made in the liver, it goes out in the bloodstream, you donate all this stuff to your various self and it goes back to the liver and it's, you know, it's sort of like recycled. Well if you can't recycle it then it stays in your bloodstream sort of indefinitely. And then it can undergo inflammatory transformations there and all sorts of things. You know, bad things happen.

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       And so the longer you have something in your bloodstream, if it's there for, for, for like decades, chances are some shit's going to go wrong. Right? There's this a dietary issue or a hereditary issue in terms of like the size of the ldl. So I don't know how much is known about the hereditary aspect of it. It's known that April we for can increase the risk of just having more ldl total there. Right? And so what type of Ldl it not known, just like regular total ldl, not looking at the particle size now that particle size, what we do know is there's a big nutrition factor that regulates that and the nutrition factor that regulates that is refined sugar and that's been shown in controlled randomized controlled trials were like healthy men given almost like something that was like a soda, you know? Um, they were, they were given a big drink of just sugar, sugar, sugary drink for three weeks every day and it completely increase their, their inflammatory biomarkers for like 100 percent.

Speaker 3:          01:12:55       But it also ramped up their small ldl particle size. The limit. Let me stop right here because this is a really important point for people that think that drinking a large glass of orange juice is different than drinking a glass of soda. It's really not. No, it's not because you're not, you don't have the fiber crazy. I mean, that's crazy. If you, if you say that to most people, they're like, what are you talking about? You're talking nonsense. No, if you have a 24 ounce glass of orange juice, you're getting a giant dump of sugar in your system. Right? And it's. There's many people that think that that's a healthy thing to drink, right? And so and that's, and that's what complicates all these studies is that you then have people eating, for example, saturated fat which is known to increase the large Ldl ldl.

Speaker 3:          01:13:40       It's known to increase that and in combination you have people that are drinking orange juice or even worse, eating cookies and cake and drinking soda and bread, all that refined carbohydrates stuff. Now those two in combination together, you've got that. You've got the Ldl, and then what happens is with the refined sugar is inflammatory transformations happen and you get the small dense and why it's a problem when people try to look at Diet and very simplistic ways, right? When people try to say, if you eat saturated fat, if you eat cholesterol, you're going to have

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       high cholesterol in your body and your going to have heart attacks, they're going to have a stroke. I mean, this is this a very simplistic thing that people will often say.

Speaker 1:          01:14:20       Yeah, it is. It very, it, it, it, it really, truly is. Like I said, it's, you have to look at mechanism, controlled trials. You have to look at observational studies are also important. Um, you know, we also have looked controlled trials where people that are put on a high fat and low refined carbohydrate diet for a month or so, or something like that. I don't remember the exact time, had all like biomarkers lowered for heart disease risk.

Speaker 5:          01:14:44       Is there something that people can do to take on that diet? Like how do, how do you do that if you want to go vegan is. I know a lot of people will like to be Vegan, but in order to get all those fats and especially low carbohydrate.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       Well, so I think that first of all, for anyone doing any diet, like whether it's a Vegan diet or a ketogenic high fat diet or a low carb high fat diet or whatever diet they're doing, first thing you should do is definitely measure these biomarkers. LDL particle size can be measured triglycerides, inflammatory biomarkers like high sensitivity, c reactive protein. Where would someone go to do that? Like what's a good place to go? Um, true health diagnostics. I mean, I don't, you, you can ask your, your primary care doctor. Um, I know truth, true health diagnostics is one that does like whole panel of really good ones, including the small dense ldl particle size and a growing number of physicians do measure Ldl particle size wellness. Fx is something if you don't want your physician to know what your ldl is because they don't want them to have some opinion about it. Wellness effects is a company that will also measure your ldl particle size and a variety of other biomarkers as well. Now what you're saying

Speaker 5:          01:15:59       about um, refined carbohydrates or refined sugars and Ldl and small Ldl, Laura, large Ldl, is this common knowledge amongst primary care providers? I mean, is this something your doctor's going to understand? Are they going to try to put you on standby?

Speaker 1:          01:16:15       It's, it is not ubiquitous. It's not standard of care and it's not ubiquitous, ubiquitous in, in, in the medical profession yet because it's just within the past decade have been starting to. Scientists and researchers have been starting to uncover these mechanisms and it usually takes a long time to translate this knowledge because now large scale clinical trials have to be done in x number of them have to be done. A lot of, I don't know, everything that goes into how regulations are made, but it's a lot. It's a lot of clinical trials and a lot of things before any sort of, you know, regulations are changed. So that's something that is not standard yet. You can always print out papers, give them to your physician. I interviewed a Guy, a guy on my podcast, he's a cardiologist. I'm an md. [inaudible] name is dr ronald krauss. He's actually the guy who pioneered the test to measure small dense ldl particle size and he's really been a leader in the field for understanding the role of small dense ldl particles in cardiovascular disease risk and, and how basically a person with high ldl total cholesterol may not actually be at risk for heart disease unless you look at the actual particle size and, and things like this is what confound the literature because you can.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       And this is what people often refer to as cherry picking. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine have hand people say that because it's like anyone could do that. I feel like really the response that someone should say is look at the totality of the data, look at the clinical trials to look at the observational studies looking at mechanism, look at everything and get the picture. Like that's, that's, that's the way you should, you know, approach nutrition, science. So, um, you know, he's really been a leader in looking at all that. But I kind of didn't answer your question about the people that are vegan and want to go eat more of a, um, a high fat, low carb diet or even a ketogenic diet. Right? You know, so that's, that's something that they're vegans are interested in doing as well. And you know, I've never, I personally, um, because my ape a background and by the way that's kind of what motivated me to get.

Speaker 1:          01:18:19       I got super into this new field called nutrogenomix interaction between genes and diet because I found out I had this illegal and I knew there were sorts of risk and I'm like there's, there's absolutely things you can do and your diet and your lifestyle to modify that disease risk. And so if that's something that I'm really interested in, um, and people can actually, you can measure your dna, but the dna doesn't tell you everything. You have to measure blood biomarkers. Like the blood biomarkers are really key to know if a diet it's working for you or not. And if it's not working for you, like I've had people emailing me, they've used, I have a genetic tool that people can use and if they want to look at april before ppr gamma, those are like free reports. They've, they've tried to kenogenic diet and it was like awful for them.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       Their inflammatory biomarkers went up there, small dense ldl particle went up, all this stuff that happened and then they'd use the tool and found out they had, for example, the ppa, our alpha gene, which is a gene that's key for the process of ketogenesis producing ketone bodies from, you know, from oxidizing fatty acids and, and people that have a certain one don't do it very well. And like the diet can be detrimental. Like it can, it can do more harm. That's critical because, uh, you know, first of all, I've been the irresponsibly telling people to do that too. Like I said, I think he'd agentic I responded very well to it. So I've been telling people to get on a record, delete, try it. So for what is exactly the gene, what is the issue? So there, so ppr, alpha, it changes, it's a gene that's involved in, it's involved in fatty acid metabolism, absorption of fatty acids.

Speaker 1:          01:19:48       Um, it's also, it's in the, in the liver involved in producing ketone bodies from, from the fatty acid, so that specific gene is essential for the process of ketogenesis during a fasted state and also if you're doing a ketogenic type of diet and so a certain, there are certain variations in that gene that don't do it very well. And so the high fat diet, what ends up happening is, uh, you're not, you're not metabolizing the fatty acids and producing the ketone bodies quite as well. And so you end up having more free fatty acids floating around in your bloodstream which can antagonize insulin receptor and make you more insulin insensitive, which is exactly the opposite of what ketogenic diets really do, you know. So there's this very response. You can also, um, have more inflammatory biomarkers for various reasons as well because you're not oxidizing the fatty acids and ketone bodies as well.

Speaker 1:          01:20:35       So there's lots of things that change. But like, you know, knowing the genes is one component. I think I think that you have to measure the biomarkers first and once you, you're doing something like a ketogenic diet, for example, then you would measure all your lipid particle sizes, your triglycerides, inflammatory biomarkers to want to measure hba one c, which is your glycated hemoglobin, which is a marker of sort of your longterm blood glucose levels. You have one test initially with a baseline test before you enter into. Exactly. That's really key. Do you think the origins of this is your ancestral origins? Like what your ancestors diet consisted of? Low fat, high carbohydrate. That's what I was kinda getting at first. I mean, that's the theory at least, right? Like, we don't, we can't prove that, but that there are scientists looking at like different regions, like people that live, for example in northern europe, how they eat more fat and they're able to do that better.

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       And so there are scientists that are investigating that because it's interesting to know why a, why that is. But yeah, that's, that's the thing that's, it's. And I think it really explains a lot, like with the ketogenic diet, um, there's, it's something that I've become really interested in recently because I've been following the field and it appears as though there is a really, um, there's something about it that is really important for the way your mitochondria age. Like it really seems to help your mitochondria age better. And I think that there's, you know, there's multiple, I talked to, uh, a sort of an expert. He is the president of the buck institute for research on aging, um, and he, his name is eric burdon and he just recently published a really big paper showing that in animals, cyclic ketogenic diets could extend their health span.

Speaker 1:          01:22:16       So they are basically healthy part of the life they're living. They were living longer and they're living better and, and, and also their memory was dramatically improved. And when you say cyclic, is there a specific range that your cycling. So that. And, and this is how these questions for him that I, that I asked him about, um, and the cyclic. So it was every other week. So one week they were key to genic, next week they were just getting normal normal chow diet and then ketogenic, so they're recycling every other week. And the reason for that is because for whatever reason, um, animals, when they just, when you just give them food to eat, like, like ad lib them, like whenever they want, even if it's ketogenic, they'll just, they'll keep eating, like they'll just keep eating it and they can become, it can become an obesogenic diet where there, where they become fat and it can actually decrease your lifespan even though it's key to genic.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       And I think that's partly because fatty acids, um, in order to use them, they have to get inside the mitochondria to be used and that energy. And if they don't get inside the mitochondria, then they just get taken up into adipose tissue and stored as fat and fatty acids themselves will, when the levels are high enough, shut that transport system that does that off. So it's like a negative regulator. So if you just keep on bombarding the body with fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, like nonstop without a rest, then you start to like not be able to use those fatty acids because it inhibits the transport system. It's called the karnataka, pama. Total transfer is for those nerdy, nerdy biologist geeks out there, um, that, that, you know. So anyways, I totally digress tigress there. But, um, it's um, uh, yeah, the cycle can inject dye so that, that was something that extended their health span and I became very interested in that.

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       And so the thing that's super interesting and as I was talking to dr budin about this is that, you know, there's a couple of things. One, obviously you're not getting a lot of blood glucose hits all the time, right? When, for the most part, if you don't have gene polymorphisms that are changing the way you process saturated fat, right? So you're not your, your, your insulin response is not happening quite as often. That's lowered and there's, there's, there's benefits with from that alone, right? But for someone like me that doesn't eat refined sugar, doesn't eat any refined carbohydrates. I mean, all of my carbohydrates come from leafy greens or, or vegetables and berries and some, some, some other fruits, um, you know, so, and my blood glucose levels have always been pretty, pretty good, like fasting blood glucose and all that. Um, with the exception of my lack of sleep recently in, you know, but so the question I wanted to know was like, okay, well, what else is going on?

Speaker 1:          01:24:51       And it seems as though the production of the major circulating ketone body, beta hydroxybutyrate really is having an anti aging role and you know, dr dan's work show that it, it's, it's changing the expression of genes and it's like activating longevity genes and all this. But the thing that's super, super interesting to me is that the way it's metabolized by mitochondria is different than other energy sources. And without getting too much into chemistry, it's not, um, in order to produce energy, you have to use something called electron reducing equivalents. And they can be in the form of nad nadh ratio or fad to agent. So it's not going through one of those pathways that generates more free radicals. And we're basically leaky electrons that can damage mitochondria, it doesn't go through that pathway, like other energy sources. So it's like you end up net not, not, you know, basically having lower, lower inflammatory and lower oxidative damage. Your mitochondria. It also doesn't have what's called proton proton, a fork activity. So it's almost like the way your body, your mitochondrial metabolizing it is better because metabolism, you're constantly generating damage,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       like damaged constantly. Right now all the time it's just from normal metabolism. And it seems as though there's something about that beta hydroxybutyrate that's superior and it's, it's, it's definitely gotten me super interested in it. And you know, for, for like the longest time I was thinking, well I'll get my beta hydroxybutyrate by doing time restricted eating right. Or I'm eating all my food within like 10 hours. And then I'm, I'm fasting for 14 hours and I'm, you know, depending on how active, what your activity levels are and all that, how quickly you deplete your liver, liver glycogen, you can start to make beta hydroxybutyrate even within like seven hours if you're really active, you know. So I was like, well I'm getting my beta beta hydroxybutyrate from the fasting part of the time restricted eating right. But I've become super interested in, in this possible even because there's other reasons I don't eat a ketogenic diet.

Speaker 3:          01:26:54       I like to get all the micronutrients. I like to get prebiotic fiber, you know, that's really good for the gut microbiome. But then again I don't, we don't know exactly how ketogenic diets even effecting the microbiome. So that's sort of still an open, you know, open fields. So I, I'm sort of thinking can I do some sort of cyclic, you know, cogenic die and also for me because I have april before I do eat saturated fat, but I eat it from like whole foods I don't like. I used to do a lot of cooking with coconut oil which is high in saturated fat. And I'm like what do I need to do that for? Like I don't really need to cook with coconut oil. I can use avocado oil, you know? And so I changed that and my ldl just dropped 20 points from just that alone, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:27:34       So it's like, and what it will with large versus small? Yeah, my ldl overall, the first time. So my baseline, I didn't measure small dents so I don't know what my baseline was, but I did measure the large, so the large and like I said, the large can transform into the small events and so with, with refined sugars, with refined sugars, that's what's. No, but like you mentioned genetics, there may be something that we don't know. What is the mechanism for the transference of the sugar with the ldl? Like w what? What causes it to become small? Dense. I'm not sure we entirely understand that yet just because it's definitely a correlation in their head and it has been shown in clinical studies to, to not just be correlation but causal where you give people refined sugar and they're. They're small dental school. Yeah, same diet, same diet, adding refined sugar.

Speaker 3:          01:28:24       You see a radical difference. You measure their small dense ldl before giving them the refined sugars, same diet, and then you measure after the soda blast of refined sugar for three weeks and they're small, dense ldl particles going through the roof. So that's causal because you're giving them something, you're measuring it before and after effect, and if there's anything that we can conclusively point too, it's that refined sugar is absolutely bad for you. There's no doubt about that, right? I, I think so. I think that, you know, there's so many studies that have shown, you know, the inflammatory biomarkers go up, your small dense ldl biomarkers go up. There's correlation studies showing that people that eat refined sugar have like tila

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       mirrors, which are a biomarker for aging that looked 10 years older. You know, even though people, they're the same chronological age is other people that don't eat the refined sugar. There's studies and men would like, they give men 75 grams of refined sugar and their testosterone drops by 25 percent. I mean, it's changing a lot of things in the body in a negative way.

Speaker 5:          01:29:20       Well, mine, my testosterone doubled when I changed my diet. When I cut out the pasta, when I cut out the bread and I started eating more saturated fat, more protein, and I went to the ketogenic diet, literally a doubled doing everything exactly the same. It was stunning and I felt different like I can feel the difference, feel the difference in my energy levels, feel a difference. Cognitively. The cognitive thing was a big thing and I attributed it to cutting out refined sugars and refined carbohydrates. I think. I think that stuff's poison.

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       Well, there's been studies showing it also affects your brain and negative way as well, and people that eat refined sugar, you know, there's, there's more brain atrophy. I mean, there's lots of correlations. The one thing I will say is that, you know, there are people that are super physically active and they're like working out two hours a day and you know, those guys, they all use refined sugar. Yeah. To, you know, their, their increased transport glucose transporter, their muscles and are using it as an anabolic way to like get bigger muscle. And I know guys who do that after they work out the candy. Yeah, I'm and, and it, it's not like it's, it's. You can't compare like people that aren't working out like two hours a day or you know, like that to normal people. Raymond, sedentary weightlifters, weightlifters, yes.

Speaker 5:          01:30:33       Folded or just ripping their body apart there. I mean there's a lot of savages out there that are doing crazy power lifting workouts and benching and squatting and I know a lot of guys who like to eat candy afterwards,

Speaker 1:          01:30:45       right? Yeah. No, it's, it's certainly, you know, I think that those people, you know, they're, they're not, it's not, it's not acting the same way, be different requirements that their body needs in terms of glucose. And the thing is, I mean still it's like the way I think about it is it's not really nutrient dense, you know? I like to like, I'm like, well there's lots of. There's reasons. Yeah, there's a reason why I like to like take it if you want the sugar and eat an orange or an apple or something like that, or you should probably the better move than eaten candy, but I think

Speaker 5:          01:31:13       they just want a ton of it. And what is the, what's the anabolic factor? Like if you were going to eat candy or something like that, has a bunch of refined sugar after like an intense workout. What would be the anabolic effect?

Speaker 1:          01:31:24       Well, the glucose, so the, the workout causes glucose transporters that transport glucose to like go through the roof and so you start the glucose from your bloodstream, gets sucked into the muscle, and then in the muscle, you know, you're, you're basically, you can, you can use that as, as, as a way to, to, to have insulin and it can be anabolic, right? Where, where whereas if you weren't doing that, then the glucose in your bloodstream and it can also tip small dense ldl particles can start to form because the inflammatory transformations that happened and things like that, that's at least my understanding that's in combination of course with amino acids which are also important for the growth of the protein and muscle. But um,

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       my understanding of it, I think. So in general though, if someone could cut one thing out of their diet, refined carbohydrates and refined sugars would be a great way to go. I think the one, if you were to think about the one easiest thing that you could do that would have the biggest impact on your health. And if you're talking, if we're talking about, we're not talking about someone who's already paleo or someone like, you're right, we're talking about standard american person. Yes. The one thing that they could do to have the biggest impact on their health, I would say, is to cut out refined sugar. Like that's probably the biggest thing. The easiest thing. I mean, I don't know how easy it is, you know, it can be addicted and that's been shown dopamine levels, you know, can get activated and that it's also your gut biome. Correct? Right. Your gut biome literally has an impact on what you desire,

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       right? Yeah, it does. So you're, you're the, the thing about your microbiome and your gut is that like, you know, the, the, the microbiome eats, it's at the distal part of your gut. So it's in the colon, the large intestine, the very end of the large intestine is where most of the trillions of bacteria are. And those bacteria actually eat the fermentable fiber that we don't digest. We don't, we don't process. And the fermentable fiber comes from a variety of plants, from, from plants, and from seeds and nuts. And you know, I'm like qms as well, uh, you know, so there's different types of fermentable fiber that are found in different types of foods and they feed different species of bacteria. Well, when you don't get enough of that fermentable fiber, what ends up happening, in fact, there's been studies showing that 75 percent of the microbiome population changes.

Speaker 1:          01:33:47       And like when, when you don't get at all any fiber, and what happens, a couple of things, one is those, mike, those bacteria species, they start to eat, um, the carbohydrate that's lining your gut called mucin, which is what makes up the gut barrier that separates the immune cells in your gut from the bacteria. They start to eat it because it's carbohydrate. And so you actually start to break down your gut barrier just from that. The second thing that happens is what you mentioned is that a lot of the pathogenic bacteria will swim up to the small intestine where they're really not supposed to be. Small intestine is where you absorb sugar. Protein, fats, this warmup there, and guess what sugar they start, so they start to like eat the sugar and they start to multiply. And the thing about having bacteria in the small intestine where it's not supposed to be, is that it causes the same response that, that eating gluten causes, where it basically those, those, it's called small bacteria, intestinal overgrowth.

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       And what happens is that the tight junctions that make up the gut barrier starts to open up and open up and that allows the inflammatory immune cells to be in contact with bacteria. And of course the immune cells go bacteria and they started to like try to kill it because they think this not supposed to be there. It could be potentially harmful pathogenic bacteria. And so that starts to set off an immune response, inflammatory immune response. And the more you have, the more sugar you eat, the more your population of bacteria is flourishing. So, so that's like, that's another thing that's, that's, um, that's changing that. But it's also the one of the reasons, like I was saying with um, and I've never actually tried a ketogenetic diet, but, um, because, you know, for various reasons, but I, I'm not sure how much plants you eat, like what, like can you eat like a good amount of, can you get like some roots,

Speaker 2:          01:35:33       depends on the individual on a very small scale. Uh, robb wolf and his wife have done some pretty interesting tasks where they'll both eat the same thing and they'll both tests themselves. He'll test the, both of them, you know, x amount of minutes later and they have a radically different response between the two of them. It's really interesting. Like his wife is much more resilient and he has much more of a difficult time getting back into ketosis. It's real, it's real. He's just documented a lot of it on his, um, his instagram page. But I think it speaks to what you were talking about before that it really depends on where your ancestors evolved and really has. There's different. We very biologically so much

Speaker 1:          01:36:10       right? We do. And that's, that that affects how we respond to these foods and all that, you know. But um, anyways, uh, what was the other thing I wanted to ask you about? Oh, the nad to remember the nad I was talking about like the nad and nadh ratio in ned. So this is something, what does that add stand for? Again, nicotinamide attending die nucleotide and it's something, it's something that, um, it's kind of in a way similar to atp where it's used as an energetic currency throughout the body for, for, for various things, but it's actually required to like forgive metabolism, like you need it to metabolize fatty acids and glucose and amino acids, but you also, you need it to repair damage. You need it for a variety of other things that are happening. And the thing is, is that these nad levels in tissues that are very energetically demanding, they deplete.

Speaker 1:          01:37:12       So for example, if you're immune, if you have chronic inflammation and your immune system's chronic chronically being activated, the nad levels are going to that. And it's kinda like triaging. And so what happens is your metabolism suffers and it's been shown now that nad levels in like multiple tissues with age, they deplete. Lots of preclinical studies have shown that it plays a role in the aging process. And if you, for example, take like a mouse that has progeria this pro aging phenotype, and then you give them the nad it like can like basically kind of rescue that in a way and they like live a more normal health span and more normal lifespan. So it's like, and there's lots of studies showing that in various ways there's recently been a lot of interest in it because the nad there's a way to replenish it through supplemental form called nicotinamide riboside.

Speaker 1:          01:38:01       So nad is actually formed from vitamin b three, like nicotinic acid or nicotinamide, or from tryptofan. But nicotine in my driver's side is, um, another precursor that you can take in supplemental form. And there's been studies over the past few years looking at how in animals it's been able to eat, increase nad levels. It's able to like basically improve physical performance, cognitive performance. It's able to make your tissues age better, your organs, age better and in, in animals. So I'm now, there's like ben preclinical trials that are, sorry, clinical trials that have been under undergoing one showing that you actually can take the supplemental form of nad nicotinamide riboside and you can increase your nad levels it just dependent manner so as to say that just came out recently and there's now um, um, there's now like 10 clinical trials that have been under that are undergoing right now looking at the role of supplemental nicotine, nicotine in my right beside, in a dementia in obesity, um, traumatic brain injuries and other one and then some other type of metabolic dysfunction so that the, these are currently being investigated in humans.

Speaker 1:          01:39:12       So the sad thing is another real big interest of mine. I did buy the supplement, but I'm not taking it right now because I'm breastfeeding and I'm just not sure how that, you know how that goes. But you're asking me about the ib stuff. I think that's something that is now popular everywhere I've looked at, I've looked it up. It's like it's becoming really popular. But the thing is, is that there's really no clinical evidence of it, you know, of like if you, if you intravenously take ned, is that gonna have the same effect that, you know, taking nicotinamide riboside does, does it get into your cells? So it's an open question, but it seems, it seems like people are. I'm getting results and obviously it's all anecdotal. I don't have anything ivy. Have you ever done like ivy vitamin infusions? No. No, I haven't either.

Speaker 1:          01:39:59       I haven't done anything. Always look at it. I go, oh, that's good. What? Right. I mean I don't want to sit there and have vitamins pumped into my veins for nothing. I've had people, I've had people tell me that like great things about doing the nad nad plus is what it's actually called. But I've never actually, I've never tried that. And I think before I would do something like that, I would probably try the nicotine in my beside, which we know for a fact does increase, you know, nad levels and multiple tissues. And it would be nice to have some of these clinics that are doing it, like aggregate the data. And publish it because no one's going to fund this study like people aren't studying that, you know, so there's no way to really know if it's placebo or really, you know, because there's no data. So it'd be, it'd be kinda nice to like people would start to aggregate data on that. But well it's really interesting when it comes to data

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       when it comes to diet, because you know the whole throw the baby out with the bathwater thing. One of the studies that I've read pretty recently was about the amount of people that suffered ill health consequences that ate red meat five days per week versus people who didn't. But what they didn't take into account was what the people ate with the red meat when they drank soda with it. How did you get your form of red meat? Was it grass fed beef? Was it bison or wild game? Or was it a burger from wendy's with fries and the sugar bond and all the bullshit that people eat along with the food and that you, you literally. And people would cite these things as being evidence that something is negative for you, that red meat is negative for you, but you're not taking into consideration all of the things that we're eating with that red meat.

Speaker 5:          01:41:44       So these studies that come out like that are so they're. They're really annoying because it's like you have to, you usually talk to people about it. You have to like sit down with them. Okay, sit down. Okay, this is a long process to try to try to figure out what is the cause of these issues when you're talking about a lifetime of abuse, you're talking about like all sorts of different health consequences of a variety of different foods and you're attributing it all to one part of your diet and that's very difficult to do unless you, you've isolated everything else and done a bunch of different studies where okay, I ate nothing but fruits and vegetables and I really healthy and I read meet five days a week or I nothing but shit and fries and bonds and pasta and I didn't eat red meat at all. And now here's the result.

Speaker 1:          01:42:34       Right? If you're making a really good point and that is the combination of how these different foods are interacting in our bodies, extremely important. Like we talked about the refined sugar and saturated fat combo. Well, you know, the, the, the red meat and even just protein like itself, like, you know, essential amino acids that are coming from animal protein itself and how that is interacting with, you know, eating, eating a terrible diet like refined sugar which is causing damage to ourselves. You know, also exercise and this is something really, um, the, the, the protein, a exercise thing seems to be really key. But there was a recent study that was published that was the largest study observational study done so far, looking at protein intake and all cause mortality and cancer mortality. And it found a, like a lot of other studies that higher protein consumption, higher meat, protein consumption from meat was associated with a higher all cause mortality in a higher cancer mortality.

Speaker 1:          01:43:34       But then when the data was analyzed and, and, and other unhealthy lifestyle factors will look at. So. So if, if someone had one other unhealthy lifestyle factor being either obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption or being sedentary than they had a higher, they were, had a higher all cause mortality in a higher cancer mortality if they meat. But guess what, if they had zero, none of those other unhealthy lifestyle factors they didn't have. They had the same aisle all cause mortality and cancer related mortality that the non meat eater tat. So I think that really highlights the importance of other lifestyle factors. Other foods, you know, that's really important when we're at, when we're looking at these observational studies,

Speaker 5:          01:44:15       when you were talking about saturated fat and the negative consequences of eating refined sugar with saturated fat, is there a negative, I'm a corresponding negative consequence. Like if you had a negative or if you had um, a, a diet that didn't have any saturated fat in it, but you ate refined sugar, like say if you eat a vegan diet, does saturated or does refined sugar have less of an impact

Speaker 1:          01:44:43       of eating refined sugars? The ldl, it's an issue with fat it, I think. Yes. So the ldl will go down if you're eating a vegan diet and even though you're still eating cookies or some whatever vegan stuff, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:44:59       fine. Sugar's probably like less dangerous to someone on a vegan diet. Is that?

Speaker 1:          01:45:03       Yes, I think so. And, and the thing, the thing with that is, is that if you look at, but if you look at refined sugar, also refined sugar is associated with heart disease risk. In fact it's like one of the, you know, there was a big, big study like 400,000 different individuals looked at refined shirt, people that had the highest refined sugar intake, but again, saturated fats, a confounding factor there had like a four times higher risk of getting heart, having a heart attack. But it's perfect. You illustrated it perfectly. And that is, and that's where I think a lot of these guidelines, like the american heart association come from. If you on a population level, if you say to someone reduce your saturated fat intake, you're going to lower the ldl risk and regardless of all the other stuff they're doing, you know, it probably will on a population level, lower their heart disease risk, but on an individual level like someone like you and I, we don't eat all that other stuff, you know, we were very health conscious and do all these things.

Speaker 1:          01:45:56       You and I, if we stopped our saturated fat intake, likely, you know, for me, I guess my jeans are a little different but likely wouldn't have the same effect. So if you were to take that same population of people and say, okay, eat your saturated fat, but take out the refined sugar, we may see the same thing where the, where the heart disease risk goes down just like it does with saturated fat. In fact, there had been studies where a replacement foods have done, have looked at, um, replacement fruits for saturated fat. And if you replace saturated fat with refined sugar, it does not, um, lower the risk of heart disease. So basically that's kind of a proof of principle there, but I do think that it's, it's an, it's an important point and it's something that the american heart association there, they're now starting to at least mentioned the small dense ldl particles. So I think that moving in that direction is because it means

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       that possibly then, you know, over the next decade we're going to start to see, okay, now we got to start. It's not just the ldl, I'm confused about something you just said. You said if you replace saturated fat with refined sugar, if you replace the saturated fat with refined sugar, refined carbohydrates, which I usually think of as refined sugar, refined carbohydrates, it does not. So the idea is of saturated fat was so bad. If you replaced, if you took the saturated fat and replaced it with refined carbohydrate, it would lower the risk of heart disease. And it does, it doesn't. It doesn't lower the risk. Right? So, so basically other saturated fats, the saturated fat along with refined sugar that has some sort of a negative synergistic effect. That's what, that's what the data and aggregation, looking at the clinical trials, looking at the mechanism, looking at the observational studies and and understanding the interaction of all these foods together and the wideness when the american heart association puts out sort of a blanket statement like that.

Speaker 3:          01:47:47       A lot of people take it as fact and then what my research has shown my reading rather shouldn't say research. I'm a dummy, but the people that I've read who have criticized this are actually scientists and researchers. They have a huge issue with that statement. They think that this is just, it's too simplistic. It's not taking into account all the various nuances in genetics, diet, ancestry, all the different factors, but people read that and it sort of like this cookie cutter approach and then they paired it out to everybody else. Yeah, it's true. I mean that's. That's exactly what happens and that same thing goes with the protein in it being bad as well and there's all sorts of nuances and the combination of the protein with the, with the bad diet and also the exercise, which is one of the. One of the things with the, with the protein is that it increases igf one and igf one growth factor and it can allow b cells that are damaged, that would otherwise die, not die, and so it can allow precancerous cells to form a tumor and that's.

Speaker 3:          01:48:45       We know that from mechanistic studies and you know that's. That's kind of a big part of the the eating protein essential amino acids specifically or what does it do do this and they're found in animal protein and that. Sort of the big argument there, but there's also this whole argument where if you are one exercising the igf one goes into your brain. It's been trying to cross the blood brain barrier. It goes into your brain and also in your muscle where it grows new neurons in the brain and actually repairs damaged, damaged muscle tissue and helps grow muscle tissue. Which is also an a predictor of of all caused mortality. So you know the, again, the exercise comes in there and then also the fact that if you're eating a good diet and you're not, you're not causing as much damage to happen in the first place, then those growth factors being there aren't as big of a deal because you don't have all these damaged cells from all this refined sugar you're eating that can basically become cancerous cells. So that's kind of, you know, with that study, the observational study that looked at people that were eating me, if they didn't have any of those unhealthy lifestyle factors, guess what? They're all cause mortality and cancer mortality was the same as the vegetarians.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       And I think that's kind of highlighting that, that, that issue, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:49:52       well I have a friend who's a scientist who's talking to me about me and he goes, ms dot essentially amino acids, protein and water. He's like, it's not going to cause you cancer. It's like this is not what the problem is. He goes, you, you have some issues with the way it's cooked. So for sure like things that are charred or not good for you, there's carcinogens right? And in the black and charred.

Speaker 1:          01:50:10       Yeah, I mean there's heterocyclic aiming second forum when you cook meat at a really high temperature and those are carcinogens and. But our body, our bodies have genes that are able to inactivate those somebodies, but some not people can do it to, to various levels. There's certain polymorphisms in genes that I'm basically, some people can detoxify it really well and they're, they're called detoxification enzymes and some people don't do it quite as well. And the people that don't do it quite as well probably shouldn't charge their meat as much. Like you shouldn't eat it like everyday, like charred, but, but that's not. The big issue isn't so much that as the, the igf one, which doesn't cause cancer, but it allows cancer cells to grow. So the difference, it's like one is like, oh you eat meat, it causes cancer. Well no, that's not necessarily true.

Speaker 1:          01:50:56       You eat a lot of meat and you don't exercise and you keep having igf one around and you have all these other damaged cells because you're eating all this other crap which is causing damage. Then you're allowing the igf one no, to allow those damaged cells to grow. So one is like a promoting where it's promoting the growth of cancer and the other one's saying it causes so it doesn't cause in that sense. Now in the carcinogen, if you're getting a ton of carcinogens and plus there's studies showing that eating cruciferous vegetables, the isothiocyanates and people that have that gene polymorphism that don't detoxify the heterocyclic amiens as well. If they eat a diet high in, in cruciferous vegetables and they have isothiocyanates it, they also inactivate those, those web pro carcinogens and so a broccoli sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli sprouts industry. The last time you were on it, it's amazing. I've had people emailing me that like they're either them themselves or their father or someone there taking care of their prostate cancer biomarker. The prostate stimulating angela antigen has like gone down like two fold after doing the broccoli sprouts every day for x amount of time, which is something we talked about because it's clinical. Clinical trials have shown that it's, it's very powerful. Now when you, um, when you look at animals, animal

Speaker 2:          01:52:16       protein, and I'm including fish in this for this, um, is there any benefit to a specific type? Like someone was telling me that red meat is better for you than chicken and I was like, well, how do you know? And they're like, well, how it makes me feel kind said, okay, well that doesn't seem to make much sense. Like what is. But is there a difference? I mean obviously there's a difference in the protein content, like have some meats or wild game has much higher protein content than say domestic beef. But when you

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       think like fish, like is there, is our living animals all created equal? That's the question. Well of course there's lots of differences. I mean if the protein, the amino acid makeup are different and I'm not an expert on that so I can't tell you all the differences there. But there's differences in, in the micronutrient concentrations. I mean omega three fatty acids are in fish, are a lot of irons and in red meat. So there's difference, different zinc, you know, iron, selenium, omega three fatty acids, all these different things are found in different concentrations, in different types of meat and you know, so for that reason it's kind of good to eat a diverse array of different types because you're getting, you know, 22 percent of all your enzymes in your body require micronutrients as a cofactor to work, you know, and the omega three fatty acids are important, you know, really important for the brain, hugely important for the brain.

Speaker 1:          01:53:33       So I think that in that respect, you know, there are obviously differences in terms of the different types of meat that you're eating, right? I mean, so, so yeah. But um, and then the ratio of the proteins are different. I don't know exactly how, what, what those differences are, but you know, there's, that affects things as well. So do you think what a good healthy approach if someone does eat meat is to d a little bit of everything, like a little bit of salmon, maybe a little bit of red meat, a little bit of bias and a little bit of chicken. I think that's the approach I like to take because I like to, I like to look at things in terms of nutrient quality and why am I, why am I eating this food? Oh, I'm eating this food because I want this type of amino acid profile.

Speaker 1:          01:54:17       I want these micronutrients, you know, I, I want 'em either this type of prebiotic fiber or not and you know, so I kind of look at it as these nutrient delivery vesicles that I'm like taking in. And that's, that's the approach I like. I, you know, it's, I'm a little biased because I've been doing a lot of research on micronutrients and so I, you know, I know how important they are and I've, and I've, I've studied even in people things like biomarkers of aging, like dna damage and seeing how they change with different micro nutrient intakes or different types of fiber intakes or you know, things like that. So, so, you know, for me, I kind of am a little biased in that sense, but um, you know, it's, it's the approach that I like to take, you know, for example, this is a really good story.

Speaker 1:          01:55:02       And my, my mentor Bruce Bruce ames, who I talk about a lot, he was the inventor of the ames test, which is a test that really cheap test that you can do to determine whether or not something is a carcinogen. In fact, I'm sure the heterocyclic amines were determined from his test because you can dump something on and he can base it, basically can tell you like in a matter of minutes. Right? So he's, that was his, like he, he was, um, pioneered that back in like the late seventies, early eighties, and he was responsible for getting carcinogens out of hair dye, women's hair dyes out of children's pajamas. Lots of, lots of really big health impacts that he was in pajamas. Um, there was some kind of polyurethane ish thing. I don't remember exactly. It's not there anymore, but it was, it was, it was to prevent them from, it was a flame retardant.

Speaker 1:          01:55:45       Oh, it was a flame retardant and it was, it was completely a carcinogen and it was ending up in children's urine and stuff. They were measuring it. Yeah. So anyways, my point is is that he used to be in this whole like cancer or chemical carcinogen field and then one day like, you know, someone in his loud did, blab, did an experiment where they like left full laid out of the sample and there was massive amounts of dna damage happening. He was like, what's going on here? And they started to do this in mice and found that like a low folate dial diet caused damage to dna, the same as being irradiated by an x ray machine. The exact same. And then he went into people and found there was a really small pilot experiment but similar the cause dna damage on people that had a low full a diet.

Speaker 1:          01:56:31       And he said that one experiment right there changed the whole course of his field of study where he all of a sudden went into nutrition and micronutrients and that became his thing from the eighties on and kind of from an accident. Yeah, from an accident, doesn't that happen all the time in lab? All the time. It's with the best stuff. It was funny because the guy in his lab was like calling. He was trying to figure out what is going on here and then he. He looked at his assistant had ordered this media that you put on cells and he looked at the media, try to figure out what was in it and they saw it was a specific type of media that the assistant had ordered incorrectly that lacked full late and so this whole thing was all started from that and so credible. Yeah. So he published that seminal paperwork. Literally he compared my being irradiated under an x ray machine to low folate and it was identical. Now, would that be

Speaker 5:          01:57:19       be something that people should take into their diet of say if they are flight attendants are pilots because don't they isn't like flying like a form of radiation. You do get some radiation that's similar to an x ray, right?

Speaker 1:          01:57:32       Yeah, I mean that's the full eight. It's a different mechanism by how it's preventing it. Basically eight is needed to make a actual precursor to dna and without that precursor, you don't make the dna right. And you incorporate a nucleotide from rna into it and so you basically make a break in your dna strand. But um, but dna damage is, yeah, is something that happens with, with pilots and astronauts and things like that. And I'm had been measured. Uh, yeah, it's been measured. And if there was a really weird study that came out recently that astronauts, they had like exceptionally longer telomeres than. Yeah, where it's like, it was totally counter intuitive where dna damage usually causes telomeres get shorter. And so like if you were to have asked me, I would have predicted that the astronauts would have had shorter telomeres. So, so definitely some weird stuff going on.

Speaker 1:          01:58:27       We don't understand, you know, but, um, and there's obviously a variety of other things you can do to protect yourself from that. But I forgot why. The whole point is that the micronutrients were important. Bruce ames is, has been my mentor and friend for many years and, and I've sort of been in this field of study for, for awhile and so it's, it's, it's, it's how I think about food and doesn't mean it's the best way, but it's the way that I've convinced myself so far with the tools that I have available to me that that's how I like to eat. Um, and again, anyone that's doing any sort of diet should always measure biomarkers and things like that to know if it's working for them. What's a good source of folate leafy greens. In fact, my bruce, his mentor when he was a graduate student is the guy who identified, he actually discovered full life by identifying, isolating it from spinach.

Speaker 1:          01:59:15       So spanish. Um, yeah, leafy greens are great source of fully, um, but the leafy greens, like the other thing that gets me on this, and I know I talked about this last time was like other compounds that are in the, in the plants where we're sort of just scratching the surface on understanding them like what they're doing in our bodies. Like one for example, is looting, it's president leafy greens, kales are really, really great source of it. Looting is like, it's found in the, first of all, it was known that routine's important for the rods and cones in your eyes, so people like they'll take supplements with ludy and to help with their vision. But all this recent research over the last few years is found is like accumulating in large amounts in the brain or like what is lutein doing and the human brain. Well, it turns out it's like there's been clinical studies now controlled trials like giving people looting and, and, and, and it's, it plays a role in, in cognition like people have better learning and memory scores after taking moodiness.

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       Um, it's involved in a crystallized intelligence which decreases with age. No. So there's like, there's things like that and other one is this one that I'm really interested in. Now I'm actually supplementing with pqq and that one is it's made by bacteria and bacteria in the soil. So it's made by bacteria because it's important for, um, it's a cofactor for enzymes for their metabolic enzymes to work well. Plants take it up from soil and then we eat the plants and get an our diet and it's been shown now in like in a few studies, lots and lots of preclinical studies. It's been shown to regulate mitochondrial function, improves mitochondrial function, clinical, a couple of clinicals trials now have been done looking at how it affects humans. If you supplement with like 20 minutes a day, improves cognition. It also improves markers of mitochondrial function. Um, lowers markers of inflammation will turns out pqq has like 20,000 times the catalytic activity, um, than something like ascorbic acid. So it's a really powerful antioxidant. And what I mean by that is, so ascorbic acid goes through cycles of vitamin c, it's, it's either oxidized or reduced and it can, it when, when, when it does this antioxidant thing, it becomes oxidized and they can do that four times where it goes, it donates, it, donates this, this hydrogen and you know, help. It helps to, you know, basically combat the oxidative stress. But then it gets oxidized again and it can do it again four times. Pqq does it 20,000 times, like, isn't that mindblowing? Often times

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       and it's really concentrated in breast milk. So I'm actually taking it right now. It's super interesting. It seems like something that everyone should supplement. I think maybe so. Yeah. Because, you know, I, you know, you never really know, but I, I'm, I'm supplementing with it and, and uh, I certainly don't notice anything because like sometimes those, those sorts of changes are really hard to, to measure. Um, and especially you have to wait until, I mean who knows, like later on in life, but I think it may be something that's important that may be a, has beneficial effects in humans as well. So, and like again, you can, you get it from plants, but 20 milligrams a day is when I'm taking because that's what the two different clinical trials have shown. What's the best plant source of it? I don't know what the best. I'm sure you could find that google, but because various various plants take it up from the soil, so probably things that are growing in the soil, right?

Speaker 3:          02:02:40       That would be the best. Um, but yeah, it's like, it's found like five or six fold higher and higher levels that it is an art tissues and plants of course, because the plants are the source of it. Um, but, but yeah, taking a supplemental form you'll be getting orders of magnitude more. Do you have a supplement company that you rely on the most? I do. So the thing with supplements is that there's, there are really risky, uh, there's lots of studies that have been published showing that a lot of supplements don't contain what they say they contain or they contain a fraction of it and they got a bunch of other filler like cloverleaf and stuff. So, um, one of the supplement companies. So, and there's a scientist friend of mine, his name is dr jed fay. He, he's like, he's the guy who discovered that broccoli sprouts are the best source of sulforaphane.

Speaker 3:          02:03:25       He, um, he measured a variety of supplements and then he was looking specifically at, like precursor to sulforaphane and uh, he looked at a variety of different companies and one of the companies that was just really, really, really good and reliable was thorn. Thorn t h o r n e, and that's something I don't have any affiliation with them or anything but that I always there my goto brand. Whenever I'm looking for a supplement like I took, I took their prenatal from throughout pregnancy. Um, actually I'm still taking the prenatal and breastfeeding. I take vitamin d and vitamin k two a, I take pretty much a lot of my stuff comes from them and the pqq, however, that, um, I've only been able to find from life extension and I think life extensions pretty okay so far as I can tell. But thorn is like my, my, my favorite company, uh, so far just because I've got data from a scientist that I, that I trust is a difficult issue and tainted supplements a or a huge problem with athletes. A lot of false positives are not even false positives. A lot of athletes will take supplements, like if they go to like some just generic vitamin store, you know, whatever name the name and they pick up some of a creatine

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       or muscle enhancer or this or that. And a lot of them are tainted with steroids or they're used in the same labs or created rather than the same labs and they don't clean the bins. And so like the vats, they used to mix up one supplement will the whatever was in residual traces of it will wind up in some other stuff. It's a real issue.

Speaker 1:          02:04:59       I think there's um, what you were referring to there. A lot of supplement companies that have a stamp on it called nsf, which is the national sanitary foundation. I believe they go and they investigate where the supplements manufactured and they look at the quality and they also, I think even look at some, some of the what's in the supplements if the, if they contain what they're supposed to contain to some degree. But I know they definitely look at the manufacturing place to see if things like that were, you know, things aren't being cleaned right in. There's contamination, all that. So supplements that have that stamp

Speaker 2:          02:05:31       probably a little more reliable than ones that don't. But it's still not like a sure thing. Right. And so it's not like it just because it has that stamp, it's, it's going to be the best, I think a lot of people listening to this and they're going to probably have to listen to three or four times and take notes and go over this and try to figure out if they're going to do something, how to act. A lot of people have a hard time digesting all of this data and trying to figure out what is the best way to proceed in terms of investigating their own health and monitoring their blood levels and, and trying to find a primary care doctor that will kind of understand what they're trying to do.

Speaker 1:          02:06:07       Yeah, I mean the, the, the primary care doctor thing, finding one. I certainly can't help with that because I mean that's the struggle that you and I have, but you know, in terms of taking, taking your health into your own hands and monitoring blood biomarkers. I mean there's a, there's a few that are really, really key I think for anyone doing anything, any type of experimentation that, that they should do. And we've, we've talked about them already. You know, the, the small dense ldl, the total ldl, you also want to measure triglycerides, high sensitivity, c reactive protein or hb, one hba, one c, which is the marker of longterm fasting blood glucose. But also there's another test that you can do that actually is a really comprehensive metabolic tests to measure how your body is metabolizing carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids. It's called the organic acid test and genova diagnostics offers it and unfortunately you do have to get your primary care physician to prescribe or order that because that's not something that's, that's, uh, available to

Speaker 2:          02:07:09       people. But it seems like there's room for a company to do this, like a one stop shop company that sort of analyzes your health and prescribed to you, you know, explains to you what's lacking in your diet and what you could benefit from and what you can. And it seems like there's a, there's a big opening for some sort of a business like that.

Speaker 1:          02:07:27       Yeah, I mean, I think some people are actually doing it. Like genova diagnostics I think is one. They do sort of do that. Like they'll, they'll tell you what's missing or like the help interpret

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       your data and genova diagnostics. And is it a nationwide company? Nationwide? Yeah, but I don't know about worldwide. So if you're in europe. Yeah, yeah. So, but I think there's other companies that are kind of wellness effects, kind of is doing that a little bit as well. They give you a consult with someone after you get a variety of blood markers measured and you know, that we try to help you figure out that as well. And uh, you know, so it's, it's certainly, I think there's other people, it's just a matter of finding a good one. It's always the, the catch, right. It seems like with this kind of stuff for the average consumer, the average person listening to this, it seems very daunting. It's like, boy, there's so much to think about. There's so. I mean in a lot of times when people get inundated with that much data, they sort of shut down, let it go.

Speaker 4:          02:08:25       This is just, I can't do this, this is too much. And I really wish there was like a nationwide network of places like this where you could just go to sort of like you can go to, you know, a dentist, there should be like a place where you can go to to get this kind of comprehensive information about your diet and the effects on your body and what genes you have. And the problem is we're still figuring out all those nuances and so, you know, even even getting the data, having the person interpret it, it's, you know, it's constantly evolving and you would have to have someone who's completely on top of it all the time. So we'd have to be like sending them do literature constantly because we're constantly changing the way we think about a variety of things and seem like some billionaire dude would look one of hire you up and have them like have you watch over them all the time and monitor their blood and try to figure out what they're doing wrong and prescribe things to them.

Speaker 4:          02:09:20       Monitor their blood, give them youngblood. Yeah. Some george soros type of care. Is that real? That young blood thing. Because I know that's a real thing with mice, but are they really doing that with people? Because I had heard that peter teal had done it, but then he says it's bullshit. He's never done it. Oh really? Yes. Find that jamie. Peter teal. Denies ever get injected with young blood. Get to know they're there. I know that the clinical trials that were done at stanford, I don't know if they'd been established yet. Fuck no. Peter teals, not harvesting the blood of the picture of him with stories of cow. Countess is bathing and virgin blood vampyr ignoble. Suck the juice out of the young have captured our attention for centuries when the story's coming out of the tech billionaire peter teal was interested in transfusing the blood into his own body scent.

Speaker 4:          02:10:11       Silicon valley to a fever dream. But, but there is something. So there's a company that does this. Oh, is there? I didn't know that there was a northern California company, a startup that does this and see if he can find that so that that is a real pair of meiosis is what it's called. And there's this anti aging is charging thousands of dollars for teen blood. Look at this kid. Kids probably high on ecstasy, right? They're always given up his blood. So they take this young person's blood. It says like plot points from hbo. Silicon valley. Peter teal. Yeah. Just ask peter teal. Incredible. Well it says no. He saying I'm looking into parabiosis stuff, which I think is really interesting. This is where the sea, he probably is looking into it. He just hasn't done it because he's probably waiting to see if someone starts growing a foot on her head.

Speaker 4:          02:11:04       Jesse a karmazin karmazin karmazin agrees his startup ambrosia is charging what? $8,000 a pop. Expensive for blood transfusions from people under 25. He said at code conference on wednesday. Ambrosia. Which buys it's blood from blood banks. Now. How's about 100? Okay. Buying his book. So they must specify who the people are. Now when you go to the blood bank, how do they even know? Like what the fuck you've been doing with your body? I'm wondering. I mean I know they monitor for certain disease like diseases and stuff. They're like, well, no, but it's like all the other nuances, all the other stuff. I don't, I don't. Sugar and candy and bullshit.

Speaker 4:          02:11:44       Is that a that represented in your blood? Uh, I mean there's certain biomarkers that you can. Yeah, you can absolutely measure and you can certainly look at telomere length or length, dna damage, things like that. I just have a joke about dick cheney. Dick cheney had an extra secret service agent that they put on this, like super healthy diet and he couldn't figure it out and you know, who would have to run when everybody else did everything. He was just really there in case dick had a heart attack. They're going to cut this guy open like a fish or pull his organs out, give dick his heart. But this is, I mean this is what you would want sort of. You'd want someone like, okay, I want your blood, I'm going to pay you for your blood, but look, can't be drinking. No smoking, no sugar, no bullshit.

Speaker 4:          02:12:23       You'd have to monitor them like you would like someone like the surrogate moms. Exactly fresh, but you'd have to. They'd have to live with me, I'd have doing them right. Well this is, and this will be up and coming. It's not just fresh blood. So for people listening, they don't know transplanting blood from young animals into old animals like rejuvenate's their brain. It makes them live longer, do rejuvenate's, all their organized so like they're healthier. And conversely, and conversely, putting the old blood into young animals messes them up, makes them age basically. It makes them perform worse cognitively and all that stuff. He's got somethings gonna pull up here. It's saying they found it in one test that it might have worked, but it hasn't been replicated in these two paragraphs. Say that it might not even be true. Which one interesting. So some aspects of aging. The 2013 study found could be reversed when older mice get blood from younger ones, but other researchers have haven't been able to replicate these results and the benefits of para biosis and humans remains on. I remember that what happened was they didn't, they couldn't replicate the mechanism. They thought it was this growth factor called bdnf

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       and they're like, oh, that's not replicatable, like that's not what's doing it. And then this other study came out showing that you could transplant the old blood into the young and it would reverse the effects. And so now scientists are going, oh, is it that the young blood is a rejuvenating or is that the old blood is accelerating the aging. Right. See the difference though? So that's kind of like, I think we're, it's possibly at now, but um, I was gonna just mention to you that microbiome that's heading there as well. Like there was a preliminary study that was published not long ago in kill fish were that the microbiome from young fish was transplanted in the old fish and it extended their lifespan by like 40 percent. Whoa. You take the microbiome from a young person, like my son breeze it down. Yeah. So, well, it's funny because, um, they think the mechanism has to do with the immune system.

Speaker 3:          02:14:22       Remember I was telling you, your microbiome makes these short chain fatty acids and it totally regulates your immune system. You know, you, it regulates the amount of um, you know, a variety of different immune cells that you're making. And so like hamata police, this is one which is making new blood cells and there's been studies that have looked at the microbiome of like really healthy 90 year olds and they look like the microbiome looks like, like a 30 year old even though these are 90 year old people. So usually the microbiomes vastly different in older people. But these healthy 90 year olds obviously they're healthy if they make it to 90, it's not, that's not an average age of most people make it to their microbiomes looked like a, like a 30 year old, which is super interesting. So it's a whole new. I think we're going to start to see like kind of like the of biosis. It's like the microbiome microbiome transplant. That's it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:15:12       I love headlines or they break headlines down and just get you to click on it. Will pope's the easiest, right. Because now it's like, you know, and they're doing these, these, these capsules now or they're taking poop. Yeah. And it's like helping people with their ibs and of course, like I think the problem was like making sure it doesn't taste like shit when it's going down on me because like the capsule cannot pronounce, just makes it was sugar. And then you've got other problems, right? A spoonful of sugar makes a poop. I know it's, it's, it's crazy. What do you think about steve? You stay like, so the stevia, um, there's, it's, it's a non-nutritive sweetener. So it's not like, it's not like a aspartame or sacrifice or what's the other one is sucralose, which, by the way, those have all been shown to like screw up the microbiome.

Speaker 3:          02:15:58       Yeah, those are really bad. Yeah. They like changed the scope is what the president drinks 12 cans a day of. No wonder why he's making shit decisions. 12. Are you serious? Yeah. So New York times story, they said that he drinks 12 cans of diet coke a day and watches as much as eight hours of television a day. So he's, he's, he's literally like a test monkey. Is that really true? That's crazy. It's really true. See if you can find that article, 12 cans of beer. It is. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans of diet coke. It looks like you're losing it using an ad blocker. That's the main, um, the main sweetener in diet coke. Aspartame. Aspartame, yeah. Trump drinks 12 diet cokes per day. What can that do to a person's body? And then they have a scientists thought we're fucked. I'll tell you what it does to the microbiome changes the composition so that you're like, you're, you're getting the kind of bacteria that are really good at harvesting the glucose from, from like the small intestine area.

Speaker 3:          02:17:01       And it makes people become obese. Like that's the associative studies and people like that. They've shown that in people. And then of course they've done causal studies in animals showing that. But stevia is interesting because, um, I've seen positive studies with that where it seems to improve insulin sensitivity, which is kind of weird. I, I personally am always, um, I, I, I'll use stevia. Like if I'm like gonna, let's make some hot cocoa with 100 percent cocoa and it just tastes like ass. And I'm like, I need some stevia. It's like otherwise you're just doing a shot of it. Like hot cocoa with no sugar is 100 percent cocoa or cacao. There's all sorts of benefits with that too. But. But yeah, with this I don't really use a lot of stevia. Like my, my inlaws they, they like to put it in their smoothies because I've gotten so used to my smoothies, tasting kaylee that I guess, you know, and, and plus I don't eat any, anything sweet so I don't really need it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:57       But they like to put it in their smoothies and you know, I don't, I don't know if it has any. We haven't really seen negative health consequences with the exception. I think there was one study in rats where they gave him like exceptional amounts and it like changed the, the hormonal profile or something. So I didn't consume any during pregnancy because I was worried about that. But um, we'll don't be a rat study study, but I think that's probably my choice. If I were to sweeten something like my put it in my coffee or something, I'd put stevia with trump is grossly overweight. So the microbiome, what's funny is that people are taking diet coke or trying or they're trying to like improve. They don't, they don't, they don't want the refined sugar. They don't want to have the, the constant insulin response and so they're drinking the diet coke. It's kind of ironic that it's like, it's like making them more be obese by changing the gut microbiome know is, is it safe to drink just one can every now and again or it's just something you can every now and then it's okay. You know, it's not. I mean that's not going to like completely not 12 cans a day or even one candidate. You're constantly under certain your microbiome. You're constantly going to keep shifting it in towards, you know, the one Canada probably. Yeah, because it's. The microbiome is. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:19:13       Diet coke, diet coke. I haven't had diet. Coke was like 2006. I had one yesterday and the hotel cracked it open. Really? I haven't, I really haven't had one since 2006. I used to drink, um, I used to drink them, um, when, uh, for lightened college and stuff to stay awake and study for exams and all that. But if you're taking something like that, um, should you take a corresponding like some sort of a probiotic to try to combat that? I mean the problem with that is, you know, the probiotics, which by the way, there's all sorts of interesting studies that have shown effectiveness of certain probiotics that are, you know, have a lot of that or have live bacteria and a lot of them. But you know, in order for the probiotics to work, you either have to constantly take them or there needs to be space in your gut for them to take residence in.

Speaker 3:          02:20:05       Right? So if you're like filling your body with all sorts of sugar or diet coke and all this, then where, where's the probiotic that you, you're taking in gonna attach, right? So it's kind of flow through and the flow through that has benefits, but you have to keep taking it, you know, for that. For that to happen. So the, so really a healthy diet is the way it's not, you can't just counteract with supplementation. You're healthy, healthy diets the way meaning, you know, the, the, the fermentable fiber which is what helps grow, helps the commensal and good bacteria basically grow and thrive. But um, probiotics helped me a lot. Like after I had some, I had some gut issues from, from stress with graduate school, graduate school. And so that definitely helped me. And um, I don't, I, I take them once in awhile now, like, you know, but I don't, I don't take them everyday like I did when I was like trying to like kill myself.

Speaker 3:          02:20:55       Um, and, and the one I was taking, I think we've talked about this $450 million. It's called vsl number three, but now there's another company called [inaudible] biome that is like the guy who made [inaudible] vsl number three is doing this is by all make the same formulation. I've tried it out as well. Um, but it's like a little cheaper anD I don't have any affiliation with either of those companies, but theRe's been clinical clinical studies with both of them showing effectiveness. and so, um, it's, it's certainly an interesting field growing field and there happens in the clinical studies in humans where, for example, the one that's super interesting, the brain, the brain stuff, the way it's affecting the brain is interesting. And there's clinical studies. There was one recent one I thinK I tweeted where there was like 10 randomized controlled trials. They weren't really high quality but it's a start and it improved measures of anxiety and people, other studies have shown in randomized controlled trials have been a couple of others showing it improves depression scores and also in cognition.

Speaker 3:          02:21:50       So tHere's, you know, again, immune system modulation of the immune system will affect the brain immune system. It definitely is kind of, you know, basically inflammatory factors and things like that can cross over to the blood brain barrier and getting the brain and disrupt neurotransmitter production and all sorts of stuff. But also the gut brain access, the bagel nerve where like you can make certain things that are like if you, if you have certain bacteria in the gut that are making, for example, gabba that can stimulate the nerve in inhibitory way that like comes in and does something calming to the, to the, to the, the brain part. We don't really

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       understand all the mechanisms. That's just fascinating field that I'm like trying to follow and keep up on, you know. But I mean, the question is, do you do normal healthy people need to take probiotics all the time and I don't know the answer, but I do think that we need to, to eat the right foods to get our microbiome healthy and avoid things like, you know, what's it called? Aspartame.

Speaker 5:          02:22:45       Yeah, aspartame. Nutrasweet. Although that's the same stuff, right? That's nutrasweet.

Speaker 1:          02:22:51       I think it is the blue packet now.

Speaker 5:          02:22:54       Well, getting back to developing fetuses and uh, an infant developing in the womb. When you were talking about, uh, foods that cause inflammation and autoimmune diseases, there's, there's a correlation between those two. Correct. So when your eating inflammation causing foods, refined carbohydrates, refined sugars, and you have a baby and if you have this inflammation in your body and you are having autoimmune reactions, uh, and this can trigger many autoimmune diseases that people have. Um, what's, is there. Has there been studies done trying to understand what happens when you consume a lot of pro inflammatory foods, foods that cause inflammation and what kind of a reaction that has to the developing child?

Speaker 1:          02:23:45       Well, studies have been done, um, you know, to, to establish causation in animals and looking at correlation and there've been correlated correlative studies in humans. So for example, most of the time though, people, the correlative studies aren't looking at whether or not they're consuming the quote unquote inflammatory foods that cause inflammatory types of reactions like refined sugar. They're just looking at obese mothers. And usually someone who's obese typically is not eating a healthy diet. So I think that more times than not can say, well, they're probably eating a lot of refined carbohydrates and things like that. But you know, and, and so that, you know, the correlation between that and looking at, you know, negative health consequences and offspring like type one diabetes, even poor, doing poorly on cognitive cognition tests and things like that that's been looked at. Animal studies, there have been studies that have shown causally that you can do that by feeding a mouse, a high fat high sugar diet and then, you know, making the female mouse obese and changing basically the way there, the offspring metabolism and their immune cells are reacting.

Speaker 1:          02:24:47       So things like that definitely have been shown in animal studies, but it's, it's really almost impossible to show a causal study like that in humans. Right. So it's like you kind of have to, like, you've got these, like you were showing with the acetaminophen and adhd to reduce risk. Like you're not going to have a controlled trial where they're going to give women acetaminophen during pregnancy and see if it causes adhd. Like that's never gonna happen. Like you can't, it's not, it's, it's, it's unethical. Right. You know. So then the next best thing would be to like then go to animal studies. And show it, you know, the problem, the problem with the animal studies, and this is, this is always problem is you know, you never know how much of it translates into things. Things are different, like the way they're, they metabolize the livers of, of mice, metabolize xenobiotics can be a little different than humans.

Speaker 1:          02:25:34       And so things like, you know, these, these mice can be a little more susceptible to things like bpa in, you know, things that are, that are damaging, um, than, than humans, which, which contain certain enzymes that some of these mice lack, that can, you know, basically alter their metabolism and make it not so harmful so to speak. Um, but, but still, I think it's good if you've, if you've got like the perspective studies in humans that's correlating. And then you've got the mechanistic studies in animals, it's a stronger, it's a stronger argument than if you just looked at one or the other. You know,

Speaker 5:          02:26:08       good studies that show. There's a correlation between gut, my gut microbiome and children with autism and asperger's and several other diseases.

Speaker 1:          02:26:17       Yeah, yeah. There have been. the gut microbiome seems to play a major role in, um, there's definitely some changes with autistic children and I'm an asperger's like being on the autistic spectrum. So, and, and that's something that's like, I'm not sure it's entirely understood, but there's a connection there. There's a connection with the gut microbiome and parkinson's disease with multiple sclerosis. I mean these are, these are lots of studies are coming out showing these connection with brain problems, not, not just, you know, autoimmune type of, of, of um, diseases like multiple sclerosis, but neurodegenerative diseases and just even behavioral diseases. So, you know, there's, it's a whole, it's a, it's a, we're kind of just starting to scratch the surface of this field with the microbiome and even cancer. Like there's, there's, you know, it's known that the, the, some of the short chain fatty acids that microbiome, certain species make, um, increase the production of something called natural natural killer t cells.

Speaker 1:          02:27:16       And there's been animal studies where you inject them with like human tumors and literally it can you give these animals a big dose of probiotics which, which help create the species that make these short chain fatty acids that make t regulatory cells, they can kill cancer cells almost as good as the chemo control that they're giving these animals. And then if you look at, there's some preliminary human trials like for example, humans that had colorectal cancer and they're given a high dose of probiotic, like close to 400 billion probiotic products a day. It like lowered their cancer recurrence. Of course they had their colon removed, surgically removed, but, you know, still it's lowering their cancer recurrence. And I think that's a interesting along with knowing what we know about animal studies and natural killer t cells and all that. So, you know, it's not just brain, but it's also a lot of diseases, cancer, you know, um, autoimmune diseases, lots of things. And gut is so important. It really is. It's the, it's the major sources of inflammation in the body. It's the major source. Like people are so worried about taking this x thing exogenously from

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       some chemical and it's like, yeah, you should be worried about that, but you should be worried about your gut health. Like really, and probably one of the loose understood in terms of like the general public. Yeah, I mean, and even scientists like we're just now really diving into that and I think that I should say at least aware, right? Yeah, exactly. Most people have no idea that it's even an issue now. When you consider the fact that the rise in children on the spectrum or corresponds with the rise of refined carbohydrates and refined sugars in our diet, do you think that there's some sort of connection there? It has a negative effect. Refined sugars have a negative effect on your microbiome is certainly. I mean there's, I think there's lots of contributing factors to autism. You know, I published a paper on this with vitamin d deficiency being one.

Speaker 3:          02:29:04       Um, I think that diet, you know, diet, um, a lot of other factors play a role. Paternal age actually plays a role. Um, smoking is also been shown like a maternal smoking apparently, particularly for the father, the father. Paternal age. Yeah. Yeah. So that, that seems to, and that's something that's a couple of studies and publish and I think even recently it just kind of a big one came out that was confirming because most people think it's maternal right. But it's actually both maternal plays a role in down syndrome. So, but uh, I'm not aware of maternal age being linked to autism, although I wouldn't be surprised. Um, there's probably an interaction with all these things in interaction with, you know, the, the quality of, of the dna in a woman's egg or sperm, sperm and the type of diet they have and whether they're taking acetaminophen or whatever, fill in the blank.

Speaker 3:          02:29:58       Pharmaceutical or diet of the father and the diet of the father you were talking about before with obese people. Yeah. And what's interesting with that now in that day, I mean that study, that was totally a pilot experiment, just looking at how it altered gene expression. But if you look in the animal studies, paternal diet, so so males, male mice that were given a high fat high sugar diet most of the time, by the way, when you see headlines and it says high fat diet causes blank, high fat diet and animal studies is always high fat, high sugar, and they always, oh, it's all, it's almost always almost always high high sucrose and high high fat. But why don't they say that? I don't, I don't know, because I guess you know, they're, they're, they're so, so drastically changing the fat composition that they just kind of always say the high fat and the interaction between these two things just really is now starting to be understood.

Speaker 3:          02:30:50       But it, it, it really is a high fat is almost always. So I always call it high inflammatory diet because it's a combination of the two. But anyways, they feel that if you feed male mice, this diet of high fat and high sucrose, they become obese and then they have offspring. If you feed the feed their offspring, normal diet. So not, not the high fat. So they're just fed a normal child. I had those offspring, female offspring don't become obese, but they get type one diabetes. So it's because, and then what and what was found is that the,

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       the um, the obesity was changing genes that regulate pancreatic beta cell, uh, insulin production in their sperm dna and that was passed on to the, to the offspring. So that's kind of again looking at. It's also comp works. I know it is, it's complex. It's interesting. I'm, I certainly am constantly trying to optimize, you know, everything I can to, you know, the best of my ability and things are always changing, you know, that's the thing with science and that's also the thing with, you know, following, following someone or following a certain dogma, you know, things change and you have to be able to like accept that things change. The more data we have, the more tools that we have at our disposal to add our, you know, to investigate things are paradigm shifts like saturated fat. I mean that's a huge paradigm shift. You know, people in my parents' generation like my dad, and you just convinced that like you say, saturated fat is going to kill you, you know, it's parented by people everyday.

Speaker 1:          02:32:22       And you know, we've talked about this before. I believe on the poc, josh, you and I about that study. The studies were either with the scientists were paid off by the sugar industry. Right? And that's the sugar industry is probably one of the worst examples. Like it's not always the case, you know, like if you have someone funding your research that is involved in whatever you're investigating, the sugar industry is particularly bad, but it's not always the case. Like I wAs involved in research, um, with blueberries and the research was funded by the high bush blueberry council. And so we did this placebo controlled trial where we are looking at, you know, there's a whole panel of scientists involved. And I was just one of the scientists involved in. I was looking specifically at dna damage and um, you know, how blueberries modulator that dna damage which can lead to aging and cancer and stem cell dysfunction, all sorts of things.

Speaker 1:          02:33:13       And there was a placebo group, so it was an enormous amount of work, you know, we had to isolate blood from patients that they were given this blueberry powder, they were taking twice a day for eight weeks or placebo powder. And then we had to, you know, look at their dna damage. And um, what my work found was that, to my surprise, so blueberries lower dna damage, which is what I thought because they have a variety of compounds in them that are known to be antioxidants. But what was really surprising to me was that it, uh, the placebo actually lower dna damage just as well, if not better, then the blueberry powder and the placebo powder had a little bit of refined sugar in it. And some. I'm like coloring food coloring and stuff. And so I was like, oh my god, what's going on here? How is the sugar lowering dna damage? Well, it turns out I had looked at gene expression data as well. All these genes, um, that are, that are involved in stress response. And in hormesis, the reason I was looking at that is because there are certain compounds in the blueberries that can have a hormetic response and I wanted to see if that was being activated. Well, it wasn't really

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       robustly being activated in the blueberries, but in placebo, some of these pathways, the same pathways that like sulforaphane can activate really well to some degree was being activated because we think it was slightly stressful. Of course it was a very small amount of sugar and, and also the uh, the dyes that were used or have been shown to cause a little bit of a hermetic response. But you know, we're going to publish that day. It's not like because the blueberry foundation funded this study, you know, you know, it's, the data is still this data is the data. We didn't change anything. So it's not always the case. And again, there's something very interesting here and like you said, science always surprises you and always the things that you like. It's something to predict. So completely the opposite. and there's something always interesting. They're always, you know, like as humans, we think we know biology and we're like, oh, this is going to be predicted to be that and all of a sudden it's complete opposite and you're like, what's going on?

Speaker 3:          02:35:11       The time you come on the podcast though, I'm reminded of the fact there's so much data. It is impossible to keep it all in your head and especially for one person. We do dealing with all these different fields, all these different, different scientists working on all these different studies and it's almost impossible for one person to have all this data in their head. yeah, it is, but it's interesting to me. It's fascinating. It's unbelievably fascinating, but it's one of the reasons why boiling something down to a clickbait title of an article is so it's so enticing because it's like, oh, tell me high fat diet kills the mites. Fuck that. All right, I'm on dumb dumb. Going back to low fat vitamins give you cancer vitamins, give you a cancer. That's going to make a headline. Yeah. Yeah. When you thInk some hilarious, you have to dig into them and you're like, wait a minute.

Speaker 3:          02:36:01       The sugar industry study was from the 1950 [inaudible] and 19 sixties probably pretty difficult to have something that biased and fraudulent today. There was even another one that just came out recently, like we talked about one last year, but there was another one that came out, another study, I think it was published in like plcs or plus one of those two showing that they, they, um, suppress data that, that refined sugar played a role in cancer and in heart disease. So, so, and this was the seventies I believe. Um, so there's more, more than one study that have now linked them to basically a holding back data being published. Um, you know, so they're, they're one that's definitely, I would say pretty bad. I had someone send me some review articles that were basically stating that refined sugar was not bad and the review articles were, we're funded by the sugar foundation and I was like, oh, this is the one.

Speaker 3:          02:36:55       I usually don't say this. Like I usually don't say like, you know, based on who funds a study like this, the conflicts of interest disclosures. But this is one time where it's like, you know, the sugar foundation, they're just notoriously bad and it's also contrary to everything else has been established right. Yet when you understand, it's like when you look at, like I say all those things, the mechanism and you look at the interaction between foods and how the body is processing these things. and you look at the observational data and controlled trials. I mean, you know, how many things can you say, you know no to. I mean you just, you know, just looking at one thing there, you know, that's not as strong. But you know, looking at all of it is the big picture. There's just so much money in sugar. So many things have sugar in them.

Speaker 3:          02:37:40       I mean, what, what we've allowed to have done in this country is literally allowed this one thing, this one substance to be in. I mean, what percentage of our food do you think has sugar in it? If you had, if you go to a restaurant or you go to get some condiments or food. Yeah, I mean those things. There's, there's, it's slipped in everywhere. Like thai food or you know, it's like you go and say, oh this tastes sweet, like sugar. It's got sugar in it, you know, so it certainly. But that's almost acceptable. So like I get what you're doing,

Speaker 5:          02:38:13       make something taste delicious because you're an artist, you're, you're cooking a meal and the meal is not just nutritious. It's all supposed to. Supposed to be a delight to the census data kind of get, you know. But what I don't get is that it's permeated our entire diet. The average american diet. it's at, it's in everything. It's in the drinks we drink, it's in the foods we eat, the bread that you consume, it's in the pasta, it's spaghetti sauce. It's in me. It's in everything. If you go down the aisle at a supermarket and just grab a random cam thing, grab it, turn it, you're going to recheck her. You're gonna see it much more often than you're not going to see it. Right. Stunning.

Speaker 3:          02:39:01       Yeah. And now that happened to me not long ago when like sent dan to the store to get some, like some kind of like I was wanting some wishes. Her sauce, like for my steak for some reason I was like having a stylistic thing. I was like, wait a minute. Oh I can't eat the sugar in it. Yeah. What's your sheer sauce? Tastes like shit. Why does it have sugar? Because it take more, tastes more like shit if it didn't, it it for whatever, you know. It's something that I ate as like a girl and I had this craving for it and received another kid to maybe it was like more common. We were young. I think so because it's really easy. It's not as common anymore. No. You never even hear about it. Like, my kids don't even know what my kid loves cholula. It's probably got sugar in it.

Speaker 3:          02:39:43       I don't know if that one does. Actually I think about that might be one of the better ones is my seven year old fucking love cholula. She puts it in everything. She put it in milk. We to tell her, stop doing that is so gross. She thinks it's hilarious. She'll squared it right at our tongue, so let's shake it right or wrong. She loves it. Doesn't no sugar. Beautiful. Great. Yeah. That's got something. I'll probably get some weird red dye. It's probably not even really read. Probably brown. I think if people are going to eat sugar though, the one thing they should do is eat it within a time window.

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       What's in there? Nothing. Sodium, gold, water, peppers, salt, vinegar and xantham gum. Oh yeah. Xantham gum. Spices. Susan seem that bad, but xantham gum. But some of the other emulsifiers have been shown to also disrupt the microbiome of course by. Okay. That stuff, those Little yogurt things the kids drink. You know what I'm saying? I don't know, but it sounds familiar. Like yogurty thing that the kids would drink sugar probably. I'm sure it does. It taste sweet wood. It's got. It's supposedly got some sort of probiotic in it for kids. Do you. Do you like limit? The other is bio kids. We they take regular bio. Okay. They take that stuff 100 percent probiotic, zero percent yogurt. Okay, so it doesn't have any lactose. I'm bullock what's in there. Does it have a ingredients thing more. Where's the sugar bitch? Like ingredients. Like on every page.

Speaker 4:          02:41:18       A hundred percent probiotic. Come on. What's in there? What's in there? You fuckers doesn't say. Does it say ingredients? They're hiding in front of you. It's sweet, man. I'm telling you. It's. I have a hard time believing there's no sugar in there. well, the other thing with those probiotic supplemented things, is that like the amount of probiotics in them or like minimal, right? yeah. I mean my kid likes kimchi. Really? Yeah. She's a freak sugar, nine grams grams and those little things. You know, my, both my youngest kids are a combination of me. It's very weird. You know, there's traits like the seven year old is way funnier. She's hilarious. She's purposely funny. That's so cool. But the nine year old is just psychotic. She's like, she'll, she'll do things like we went to a resort once on vacation and she does cheerleading and gymnastics. She's really into gymnastics.

Speaker 4:          02:42:20       She did cartwheels, a half a mile home. We had a walk like a half a mile. She did cartwheels the entire way back. That's crazy. Psycho. Yeah. She's straight up psycho. Like she's really driven. oh, she's crazy. She's got a six pack. She's really driven. Yeah, it's sad seeing the nine year old. How much you fucked kid. I'll show you. I'll show you later. Oh wow. Yeah, it's disturbing. Yeah. Like, I mean like ripped. I would get dizzy sheets. Everything. It's not like she's like a, you know, like anorexic or anything. She just exercises constantly. Early life exercise is important to know. Yeah. They do mma, they do karate. Both of them do. There are two martial arts. I've got one of them into jujitsu. Did you expose them to like different, like different things to see what they like. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it seems like gymnastics is her big one. Kids, little girls love other things where other little girls are also

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       being active, you know, so gymnastics is a good one because you know, they're all doing their tumbling and there I did that one. I think it'S really good for body control too, and I and I, and I was talking to her like she likes jujitsu and she likes gymnastics too and I said, well they really help each other because your jujitsu will benefit greatly from your body control that you get from like the ability to move your body, like do backflips and stands and it's just also just the, the balance and the ability, just the dexterity that you get.

Speaker 3:          02:43:44       I totally agree. I, I started ice skating when I was really young too, and a half. My mom started when I was two and a half. Yeah. So I started asking. I was two and a half and that also is like a lot of balance and more very similar to like ballet too or just graceful sort of things. And um, it really I think helped me with a variety of other sports I did later surfing. Surfing was, you know, a lot more graceful dance like you still serve. I didn't, haven't served since prepregnancy yeah, I would worry about sharks. You're a mommy now. I haven't eaten getting more concerned about sharks. I forgot what those things. The last thing. There is something. I am. yeah. I'm getting a lot more worried about the show.

Speaker 2:          02:44:26       Did you see that video of the guy who was swimming? He was underwater scuba diving and the shark came from behind him and bumped him in the head.

Speaker 3:          02:44:33       But you showed me the start for one on that freaked me out. Or the woman goes surfing. The shop is right next to them. There's so big and all it takes us. I mean they're eating machines that takes us.

Speaker 2:          02:44:43       Look at this sky is underwater. Check this out. Boom. Put that again because it didn't. Is that a great white? That thing's is huge. It is. look. Oh, oh. He opens his mouth. It hit him in the head. I mean that thing easily could have. Where is this somewhere you shouldn't go.

Speaker 3:          02:45:00       That's the carry. Fuck that. So do you do like snorkeling or anything? I didn't like it. I was terrified. This one

Speaker 2:          02:45:08       cool thing where we were on the Big island last year and they take you out to where the dolphIns are. They're like fine schools of dolphins and they. When the dolphins are in the area, they'll take you out on the boat. They find out where the dolphins are, they spot them, and then you jump in the water and you snorkel with the dolphins. Yeah. It was amazing today. Were they friendly? Did they come up to you? Don't give a fuck about you. That's there. Dolphins are really smart. Yeah. well they're. They're wild dolphins. They're not like, why do I care about you man? I don't even know what you're saying. I don't know what you're doing. Why? Why are you wearing a watch like this? Didn't want to have anything to do with you. Why are you monitoring your heart rate? Just avoid you, but it's just.

Speaker 2:          02:45:48       It's a crazy feeling just to be in literally the middle of the ocean, miles from the water or miles from the shore rather, and you're just looking down and you see the vastness of it all. I think it's in a lot of ways, there's a reason why beach communities are kind of cool. They're like peaceful. They're very mellow. I think part of it is because you're humbled by this gigantic body of water. That's in your face every day. I think it's. It's akin to staring up at the stars. There's just something, something about the vastness of the ocean. It's so undeniable. Your, your, your insignificance in the greater scheme of things is so undeniable that I think it chills people out. Whereas I think cities make people like more like to fucking get over their cars are in my way, get out of my way. Bitch. It's like your, your too much of an important factor in your immediate world.

Speaker 1:          02:46:42       I think that's why I was really drawn to surfing in the first place. It's because I'm a really. Gogo gogo kind of go get her constantly, constantly. Next. What's next? One thing and being out in the water was the one place that I would put all that behind and I would chill, you know, and I felt really good just sitting on my board and having the water. Of course I wasn't thinking about the sharks, but just having the water on me and just sitting out there and watching the waves and you know, it's, it's certainly, um, there is definitely a very chilling factor to it. And for sure, humbling, oh my goodness. Like I still am like terrified, like on a big day going out because the oceans is really scary. Like, aside from the sharks, like waves are freaking scary. Just the power of them around. Oh yeah, I've had um, I mean I've had some scary. It's kind of amazing. I get back in after that but, but um, where it's so powerful, I mean, you know, where it's just slamming you down, you're doing

Speaker 4:          02:47:41       donuts and you're like, what's going on? You know, I can't even imagine.

Speaker 2:          02:47:46       And um, some of those crazy people that get, they get dragged out on a boat all the way out

Speaker 4:          02:47:51       to your max towing. Yeah. They get towed in and then they just jump on those waves that are 100 feet high.

Speaker 1:          02:47:58       Like my, I get sweaty hands when I watch videos of that because I know the power of the wave and I'm like, they're insane. How can they, it's like huge, like just because some of them do, you know, end up in the whitewash. And it's like how powerful that must be upfront.

Speaker 2:          02:48:13       Dorian. He's one of those world record holder champion type, big wave surfer dudes and I've seen some videos of him doing it. It's just, it's. I don't understand. He's loud. He laughs about it when you bring it up. It's just what he does, but it's. I, I've seen videos of him doing it. What does this. Is this ham? Yeah. Here it goes. Jesus christ. Jaws to look at it like, come on. I go bow hunting with that dude. Went in Hawaii, went to lanai and we, we both wanted to look at us like how, how big those waves are and he's right.

Speaker 4:          02:48:46       So he came up out of that. Oh, it's so crazy. If that came down on you, you're dealing with what? A million pounds of water and I don't even know how like I want to know how they like survive that stuff because it does come down on them. Well,

Speaker 2:          02:49:03       I just think the. This is how he lives

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       his life. He loves it. I mean, I think he's been doing this for a long time and it's just a natural part of life to him and he lives on the big island. This is insane. Totally insane. He's clapping. He's clapping in the middle of it. It's like he's obviously having a great old time. Fuck that. For sure. I mean, I like surfing, but I wouldn't do that. Yeah. And the sharks too. I mean the big island, like you always hear about people get bit by shark, especially tiger sharks. Is that where bethany hamilton, the one that the girl that lost her arm machine in Hawaii? I believe so. I believe so, yeah. That. How about that? The little kid loses her arm. She's like, well I got another one still crazy. It just shows you how awesome surfing was. Bay, but not for me.

Speaker 3:          02:49:55       I wouldn't be that awesome for me either and I haven't gone back out. I mean I'm just, I can only get like I've got so much time in the day to like work out and I need to like I need to get the biggest bang for my buck. Yeah. So you're back running now. I'm actually having, I haven't gone back running, I'm planning on it. Like what are you doing for exercise? High intensity spin stuff so you can continue that one months. Your son you said is five. He's four months old. So yeah. So you, how long are you going to give yourself before you try to start running? You think after the holidays I'm going to do it. Yeah. What about things like crossfit or something like that? Well, I only have so much time. I think the organized I like to spin and like I said, it's not like your dance you spend.

Speaker 3:          02:50:33       I tried that, I didn't like that. Um, you do a lot of weight lifting type exercise. I need to do more. Um, I have like, I do it. I don't have a gym membership anymore. Um, so I have like weights and I'll do it like, you know, at my place, but I haven't been doing as much of the strength training as I should because that's also extremely beneficial. And you know, bone density, it's big one density, muscle mass. I mean like there's been studies showing that people that do strength training, like they have a 23 percent lower all cause mortality and like a 30 percent lower cancer related mortality, independent of any other health factors like obesity and all that stuff. So um, you know, the muscle mass is another thing that's really important. In fact there was also another interesting study showing that like people that had lake strength, like their leg strength was correlated to like massive improvements in cognitive function.

Speaker 3:          02:51:29       Legs, not arms but only the legs. So there are various, various different exercises we're done, like hand grip strength and all that, but it was leg strength specifically. I don't know if it's like something bloodflow something about your, how strong your legs are, is somehow somehow indicative of blood flow to the brain are. So dudes who do squats are jesus. If you know anybody who does a lot of squads go to them. So I do, I do air squats, body weight squats. Yeah. I do those. And like, you know, do the hindi are ones where you come up on the ball of your foot, do you kind of jump as well? No. You can do

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       squats. You, um, you, I could do it for you real quick. Essentially you start off like this and then as you go down your heels come up off the ground like this and then your hand touches the floor and then you come up. And what it really does is it works the quadriceps really well around the knees and a lot of people find it to be an excellent stability exercise called. What do they call it? Hindu squeegees. Here. This guy's going to do it. This one, see how's he's going up on his heels. This is like part of it. He dropped down. Your heels come up and then as you press up when he's not, he's not dropping his heels as he comes up, which I think is weird. He's, I think he's doing a kind of a Variation on hindu squats because his heels are never coming down.

Speaker 4:          02:52:50       He's also wearing raised heel shoes, which I don't agree with. Your heels come all the way down when you come up. Yeah, yeah. Once you go heels, go all the way down. See if you can find someone who's like, I just don't. Those shoes are not. Those aren't wise. Those shoes were invented. Those kind of shoes are. Those are running shoes that are invented back when nike came up with them where you land on the heel instead of landing on the ball of the foot, which the way your foot is naturally supposed to absorb shock, you know, not. You know. I'm sure you know about all that. We're nike sort of changed the gate. No, nope. Nike literally changed the way people run. They put this big fat heel and the back of your sneaker and people started running on the heel. Instead of running on the ball of the foot.

Speaker 4:          02:53:30       When you land on the ball of your foot, your foot is a natural shock absorber, and what they did was made people run with their heel first lifted fight. It's not good. It's terrible for your knees. It's terrible for a lot of things and people develop all sorts of issues. You run into that with running long distances and knee problems because I'm sure I used to be a jump rope or I was a professional drunk. Proper. When you professional jump roper, I want to get paid. Well we, we got um, we were sponsored by like the american heart association really. We had like, um, donations and stuff. But uh, yeah, so I started jumping rope. It's called the international rope skipping organization at that time. That's hilarious. I think it's called like the universal universal rope skipping organization now, but I was, I would compete so we, we'd go every year and compete with other teams from around the world.

Speaker 4:          02:54:18       I would travel to other places, other parts of the u, s and setup, do demonstrations in schools inside of teams. Anyways, I was really good and I can still jump rope like I could do next. Like next time I see you like jump, like if you have a jump rope or if I can remember to bring one, like I'll bring one for you next time. Next time you get to do two things, you've got to try out the tank. Coming here early. We'll set you up with the isolation tank. We'll do a sauna. We should do a podcast on. That would be awesome. We're going to start doing that because we have the sauna here. We're going to do a little podcast last long. Yeah, the heat with the recording equipment and stuff, but if it breaks it breaks. I just like. There's more new interesting stuff on the sauna like that. I would love to talk to you about like new studies coming out and so next one. Next one. Scheduled a couple of from now and then the jump rope.

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       Jump rope. Jumping on the balls of your feet. That was the point as I was going to say, if you jumped on the heels, it was awful. It was like sound. Would imagine it'd be teRrible, but when you look at a running shoe, you think of an average running shoe. The average running shoe has a lifted heel. Now people are understanding that this is negative and this is bad for you, so you. You see what are called zero drop shoes, like the vibrams or minimal issues as what I run in. I run in either a vibrams or running those. I have some murals that are running into and what they're essentially they have a wide toe box, so you're, you're toast splay out and there's almost no padding. There's is very little bad before. It's just enough of a hard cover to keep you from getting cut from like rocks and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:55:49       So that for me is when I tried them out, I was running on hard concrete who um, it was like I was running around this lake because I lived in oakland at the time and um, and so I didn't really like it. Were you running on the heels of your feet out all your calls? Yeah, it's too much. It's too much because of the concrete, but I think even that is okay if you build up to build up, but you, but you develop your foot strength changes radically. So maybe I'll get some again and try. You've got to go slow because we'll be training. It's probably a lot easier to. Yeah, I run the beach and those when I'm on vacation, I'll run with a minimal shoes, but when you're doing it, you have to build up to it because you can get plantar fasciitis where you start really destroying the bottom of your feet are very common.

Speaker 2:          02:56:32       So what do you mean, like just don't run as long distance or something. Take your time. Yeah, they like the vibrams. Uh, they got in trouble because they were telling people that their shoes can prevent injury and strengthen your feet, which they can, but it takes a long time. So what would happen is people would say, oh, I'm gonna. Use these shoes going to prevent injury. Fuck, I'm injured because they would feed a week. The idea is that your feet in regular shoes are essentially like in a cast. This is what your feet are like, you're, you're relying on the structure of the shoe. It's tightening up around your foot. You have a nice fat cushion to the bottom of it and you're using minimal musculature of your toes and all of the different fee. You're not articulating everything is individual joints and pushing with all the muscles and so when you switched from a thick, fat running shoe, like a vibrams five finger this, there's definitely a adoptation curve and you have to be careful with that.

Speaker 2:          02:57:31       I, I certainly think because when I was doing it, I was running long distances. Like I just, I didn't ease into it at all either and I was doing it on concrete. My friend neil brennan got plantar fasciitis from running on a treadmill in with vibrams. YeAh. He's running on treadmills as well. I'm just kidding. Uh, I'd say that to them. um, but, uh, yeah, he just got too crazy with it. He's, he's kind of obsessive person. He, he got into it and he's like, oh, this is the thing. I'm going to do this now in Iran, a few mIles. And he blew himself out like right

Speaker 5:          02:58:02       away. He fucked up his feet. You reverse that? Yes. Yeah. It takes a while to heal though. It's a very painful. I know quite a few people that have gotten plantar fasciitis and you, you know, you get out of bed, he could barely walk. I think my mother in law. How to. Yeah, it's rough. It's rough. So, uh, I didn't. Luckily I've done martial arts my whole life. Sorry, my feet. My feet are pretty strong, but I noticed a big difference between running with minimal minimalistic shoes. I mean just my feet just feel stronger or they just, they feel different. They feel different when I'm walking around. My archers raised up. I've always had flat feet. My arches have actually gotten higher and like my, just the overall dexterity in my feet. One place where I really feel it is in yoga and notice a big difference in yoga. I have just more foot strength.

Speaker 3:          02:58:47       I'm going to try out. The rebrand was again throughout my other ones, but my feet are like bigger now after pregnancy. So that's funny. Like it stretches your feet out abbott, maybe it's like, you know, maybe it's a cannon

Speaker 5:          02:58:58       to a weightlifting, right? Because you think it about it. You have all this extra weight in your body, you're carrying around your feet and your hips and.

Speaker 3:          02:59:06       Right. Yeah. Yeah. You definitely have a lot of extra weight. I mean, it seems like it like

Speaker 5:          02:59:11       pound vest on your back and you did a lot of exercises with a 40 pound best. Your bones are going to get more dense. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:59:17       Yeah. I would like to know. I mean, I know, I know certainly my feet were bigger during pregnancy because of the swelling and stuff, but, but I'm four months out and my feet are definitely bigger. Are they longer and wider? The wider there? Probably you have more meat in your foot. Wider. I was shocked. I couldn't like this, a pair of shoes that I'm supposed to fit. It didn't fit and it was, I was like, you know, it was too narrow. I bet that totally makes sense. I mean, think about how much weight did you gain you allowed to ask gals that? Um, I. So I actually lost all the weight, so I'm allowed to ask. I've, I've lost a lot, most of it, but I still, you know, there's, there's this a little more to me, but my god, it's crazy. It's amazing that we bounced back.

Speaker 3:          03:00:01       I gained probably more I would get, they say like 30 pounds. I gained the close to 50. I know women to gain 80, but I was eating all healthy foods. I started out very thin maybe and that, so I was talking to my ob gyn about that and um, he was telling me that really because I didn't like look obese or anything. It wasn't ambitious. I start, when you start off with a starting point, your body wants you to gain a certain amount of weight. Sure. And so my body wanted me to gaIn 50 pounds and I had an eight pound 10 ounce boy and just think about 50 years

Speaker 5:          03:00:32       pounds on your back for nine months. Of course your feet are going to get bigger.

Speaker 3:          03:00:37       They're going to be stronger. Yeah. It was an interesting study showing the v max actually improve vo two max improves after pregnancy. Sure. Makes sense. it's kind of like training in I have a bath or whatever. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          03:00:50       I have this thing. It's called a company called outdoorsmen. They make a pack that's designed to condition people for backpack hunting. Um, when you, you go, uh, you

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       carry everything. He carry your entire camp on your back, so you carry your sleeping bag. I'm a jet boil. One of those tanks that you cook on, you carry all of your equipment, you carry everything that you ate, all your food. I mean, you, you could carry as much when you, when you're wearing a backpack, when you're going into camp, you could carry as much as 70, 80 pounds on your back. So what they do this company called outdoorsmen is they make a pack frame that has a, an olympic plate bolt on the back of it. We slide olympic plates on it and you clamp them down. So you have like a, like literally an olympic weight on your back. You could put a 45 pound plate or a 90 pound plate and you do hike to condition yourself. So they have the right posture and you're building that.

Speaker 2:          03:01:44       Exactly. Exactly. it's, it's one of the best ways, like weighted pack exercises is one of the best ways to prepare yourself for that. That's really one of the only ways because you're dealing with many, many miles of hiking. That's kind of cool because I've, I've often, like, I haven't really ever done any like big camping like that, you know, I'm, I'm always like go for a hike of the day, come back, go to the cabin, you know, it's kind of fun to do that, like where you hike many miles in and take up a camp and you know, so um, but I thought like, how am I going to carry all that stuff? It's grueling. Yeah. I can imagine like there's no way I could do that much, but when some people do it, if they're only going to go for a few days, they can get it down to as little as 40 pounds.

Speaker 2:          03:02:26       You know? Some people are super minimalist, like my friend adam, he does it for many stretches at a time and he'll do like 28 days in the bush by himself. He lives in Australia. He's done it in Montana to one. Um, he did it and documented it all on his instagram story, but he's so extreme. He cuts hIs toothbrush and half, like he only has the, he cuts weight in so many different places that the handle of his toothbrush, it cuts off. So he's brushIng his teeth with like the little end part of it toothbrush, which I think is just stupid. Like how much weight are you saving? C'mon man. It's ridiculous. Give yourself a real toothbrushes psycho. But these people I'm really concentrated on making things as minimal as possible. Bringing as little gear as possible and just gettIng all dialed in. You have to kind of figure out how much water you need, how much food you need.

Speaker 2:          03:03:14       Most of the time they map out, they'll use like I'm a google earth and map out where the natural springs are and try to figure out uh, how much water they have to bring with them and how much they can get from these sources. And so then they have to have either a steri pim or some sort of filtration system to clean out the water to make sure that they don't get to understand how, what's the longest amount of tIme that you've done? Like one of these campaigns. I've never done it where they did it like that where I carried my camp on my back and I lived out there for. The only time I've ever done it is with a group of guys and we've camped for a week in Montana. But we brought everything in on canoes. So we had all these supplies. We brought them in on boats. We got out, we staked our tents

Speaker 4:          03:03:58       and we had food with us just, you know. But I know a lot of guys do it and they don't bring much food. They just try to live off the land. They just try to get successful quick with the hunting. And then theory. It's crazy, but it's the added challenge of it, you know, but the weight. But the point being that weighted backpacks or an excellent cardiovascular exercise. So to me just make sense of being pregnant. It would make your feet stronger and increase your vo two max and a lot of walking four miles a day. I know what I was doing. A great thing that there's this girl, this woman in my spin class and she's like, you can ask them. She's about to have this baby like any day and she's their bike and away. And I'm like, geez. Yeah. So she used to get crazy with it.

Speaker 4:          03:04:41       She's real tiny. Like, I mean I look back at pictures of me and I'm like, I can't believe I like bounce back from that because it's just like I'm just so enormous, you know? It's, it's crazy. It's incredible. the whole thing is incredible. Do you think you're going to do it again or you want it done? I think I might be one and done. I don't know for sure, but you know, I spent some time to think you only got four months old. I got a little bit of time to think, right. I mean like I've got pressure like my half sister and like other people are like, okay, you got to wait a year. You got to get pregnant again. I'm like, oh gosh, you know, you don't have to do anything crazy. It's so good. I have one kid. I kind of, I've kind of, I'm kind of just so in love with him.

Speaker 4:          03:05:19       Then I'm like, I don't want to share my love, you know, having kids, like my kids are two years apart, uh, the youngest ones and when they hang out together it's just amazing. You watched them hug each other and they play games together and you know, there's still like little sibling rivalries. There's always going to be. But, but there's something magical about having a sibling, you know, I grew up, the sister is one year younger than me. My brother who's four years younger than me. Yeah. I don't know, just something to it, but it's also something to have in one kid and given them a lot of attention and being able to do other things too, like science. So speaking to science, tell people where they can listen to your podcast and contribute to your research because you, you have, you have, you were saying you have, what is the, the, the patron, patron and also we have a direct subscribership where people can, if they want me to continue to, um, do the podcast but put out, um, you know, articles.

Speaker 4:          03:06:18       So my podcAst is on itunes, it's called family fitness, but you can go to my website called, found my fitness.com and there's now episode pages we have where I'm starting to now put a lot of information and found my fitness on instagram, twitter, twitter, and um, there all those codes. So here's the episodes and if you click on one, there's a summary and sometimes we're getting transcripts now, so I'm going to put a lot more information there as well. And so yeah, people are, are, are contributing money, whatever they can, they can do a one tIme or like a one five, $10 a month. Some people do more than that. And um, it's, it's really cool. It really has been a lot of fun and I enjoy it like, like it's just. I love it. Well, you're awesome at it and you, you're awesome at this too. I mean, it's ridiculous. You haven't looked at notes once. All this shit is all from the top of your head for people that are listening to this. She's not reading off of anything. she's just rattling this off. It's very humbling. Thank you. So thanks for doing this and next time we'll do the tank. Do the sauna. We try to do a podcast host. I'm gonna. Hold you to that. Okay, let's do it. We'll do it.

Speaker 4:          03:07:23       We'll do it. Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks rhonda. Patrick, ladies and gentlemen.
