I guess they don't listen anyway, go to legal zoom.com use the code word Rogan at checkout. You hear that weird noise.

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       You hear that? You don't hear that?

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       I think it's the phone. I think if I put my phone near my computer, they'd, they'd fucking argue with each other. And telepathically it's probably what it is. Um, that's it. Legal, zoom.com use a codeword Rogan. We're also brought to you by ting. Ting is a mobile service that does things differently, did do things on their own terms. And what that means is they buy time through the sprint backbone. They use sprints. So you get the exact same service that you get with sprint, but you get it with no contracts, no early termination fees, no nonsense. They don't trick you. And there's a lot of ways that cell phone companies make money. And one of the ways they make money is they, they charge you for x amount per month. Like, you know, you have a deal where you, you know, you get 1200 minutes a month or whatever the hell it is.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       But when you do that, most of the time you're not using those minutes, but you're still paying for those minutes. The weighting does it. It's a very smart and I, and I think it's a better way and I think it's the only way that they're going to do it in the future. What what they do is you pay for what you use. If you use a lot, you pay more. If you use very little, you pay less and 98% of people would save money using tank. That's a pretty incredible statistic. If you go to Tim's website, go to [inaudible] dot com they'll explain the whole thing to $21 is the average monthly bill per device for tin customers. That's amazing because you'd be, you'd be surprised at how little when you, when you look at the service minutes, you know, you know like a hundred minutes a month, 200 minutes a month. Most of the time people are texting each other's days and if you call me a lot, man, most of the time I don't pick up the phone.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       I don't spend a lot of time calling people. $440 is the average annual savings per device for a business with one to 20 employees. So if you have a business, Tang is the way to go. If you want to set up business phones and you have many options as far as the phones themselves, you have all of the best android phones that are available today and you buy them. You don't see the thing about when you go to one of the big name cell phone companies and you get a phone, you're not actually buying the phone. Like if you pay $200 for a phone, you're not really paying $200 for that phone. The phone costs probably five or 600 bucks and you think you're paying $200 but the other 300 to $400 you're paying off over the course of your contract. That's why if you try to leave, they say stick it to you and they make you pay what you owe them and so it's, that's what a contract termination fee is.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       What's all about is you still owe money on a device. You essentially leased a device. Tink doesn't handle it that way at all. With Ting. Everything that you, you, you purchase, what did they sell at? [inaudible] dot com rogan.ting.com here are the finest cell phones available today. Like the, excuse me, Samsung Galaxy s five, which is water resistant. Just added water resistant. If you're a fucking dork like me, you spell shit. That's the way to go. They have a, the HTC one m eight, all of the best new android phones, the Samsung Galaxy note three, which I use fantastic phone. You can draw on it. It has a pen. How could you go wrong? And if you like one of those old crazy grandmas, they have flip phones, they have everything. And uh, as cheap as 42 bucks, you can get a phone for 42 bucks, which is kind of ridiculous in this day and age.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       And when you buy it for 42 bucks, you actually buy it for 42 bucks. And if you know, you know, you try for a while and he'd go, you know what, I want to cancel. Just canceled. That's it. You don't have to worry about shit. It's a beautiful ethical way to do business. And the results have been fantastic. Massive, massive public, um, positive feedback that I've received from all the people that have switched over to tank saved money, loved the company, loved the idea behind the company and love the fact that they have a wide selection of devices. So go to rogan.ting.com today and save yourself some cash kids. All right, my friend Steve Hilton is here. We're going to talk about all kinds of groovy shit. Let's cue the music experience.

Speaker 3:          00:09:09       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast, Steve Hilton, my friend politics are dirty business,

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       very dirty. But just before we get into that show you, I just want to say you've already really offended me. Fantastic. Just want to show you my phone. Oh, what have you got here? It is a flip phone. So in your words, an old crazy grandma. Well, I have many friends that carry old flip phones, but I'm glad that you're actually just carrying a phone. Exactly. This is a very new development for me. Well, it's a good move. So good. Everyone's been telling you, I've got to have a phone. I had not had a phone for many years. Finally I buckled under the pressure and I got one of these Steve. Um, we became friends in Hawaii or friends or family and we're all friends. It's a, it's a very cool little, uh, development. I really enjoy it. But I think it, I think it's quite hilarious that, uh, your wife is involved in Google and you avoid phones at all costs.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       You avoid technology. You feel that it's too entrenched in our life. This sort of a digital web that we've all been connected to. Yeah. I'm trying to fight it, Joe. It's tough though. That's the beautiful thing. When you don't want to use them, you shut them off. Yeah. But that, that kind of nagging away knowing that's discipline meditates probably, right. Well, I feel that there's benefits and there's certainly negatives to phones, but I think the positive aspects outweigh the negative. I like being able to communicate with friends and family and loved ones and sent texts. And I, I, I find it incredibly addictive though. And I think it becomes, I was out at dinner the other day with a bunch of friends and everyone was on the ground, damn phone. There was five of us, and I was like sitting around a table looking at everybody, texting and tweeting and taking photos.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       I'm like, we're not even here right now. I'm like, you guys are, you're connected to this digital world. You're talking about how awesome it is to be here, but you're not even here. You barely paying attention as new sort of etiquette developing about, you know, how to handle this when there's, I think I was reading something about, well, you've got eight people around a table having dinner and it's okay for three of them to be looking at their devices. That's okay. But if it gets to more than three, someone's got to look up because that's the rule. Who says says who establish what? I don't get it. It's just there. It's just like anything else. I mean, if you're at a bar with some friends and one guy's just watching TV only and not engaging in a conversation, that's just as rude. Yeah, I think that's right. I find it fascinating. Um, how my children react to devices. That's where I really get a sense of it because they don't have a cultural context. You know, when my four year old watches television or watches devices and I'll stand front of her while she's watching

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       TV and she just reaches up and tries to move me, like she doesn't give a fuck what I'm thinking. She's just trying to watch this program. Yeah. You literally can't get in between. And that point it's like I've really noticed that if you just, you know, they're watching something, that's it. You know, you may, you may have been away for a week and you haven't seen them and they're desperate to see, but if there's something on TV at that point, no interested. Yeah. It trumps everything. It trumps all human interaction and it's, it's very weird how it does it. It does it in this strange hypnotic way. There's nothing else on earth that gets a four year old to just sit there motionless, right. And engage. But it literally stimulates parts of the brand. There's a lot of quite interesting brain science about what's going on when, when kids watch TV and it's generally fine, but when it gets to a point where they're watching you no more than two or three hours a day, and a lot of kids these days are in that situation, it literally starts rewiring their brain.

Speaker 4:          00:12:48       Yeah. It's not healthy to, to completely entrench yourself in that world and to be in that world all day, every day. But a lot of people do because it's possible. But I think that's just like everything else. It's like I liked the option to be able to buy a cheeseburger. I don't think you should eat cheeseburgers every day, all day, but I like it if I want one from driving by in and out, and I'm like, let's do it. You know, it's, it's not the best food for you, but I like the option. I totally agree with that. I liked that for television. I liked, I liked watching swamp people watch that fuck for naught, terrible show about a bunch of people, alligator hunting. And it's, it's, it's the most predictable show of all time because they're look for alligators and occasionally they get alligators, but there's nothing unusual happens.

Speaker 4:          00:13:31       They don't run into a giraffe like what the fuck it was a draft in the swamp. No, it's just alligators. And these people were these strange southern accents in boats and they have fishing line. They catch the alligator with fishing line that sometimes they shoot the alligators, but it's just alligator hunters. But they call it swamp people. Yeah. I haven't seen that. I'm not sure that's going to be top of my list. You should invest, you should invest your time, you know, doing, doing a little bit of everything. I remember when, um, do you remember that movie came out at that Mcdonald's supersize me and this guy got ill and fun. Is Morgan Spurlock? Yes. Um, you know, he made it, he made a good point. But my favorite response to that was from Mcdonald's when the, the guy who runs Mcdonald's in Australia went on, they took commercials and they went on air when there's this big PR storm about the terrible Mcdonald's food and all this kind of stuff and he, he went on air with these commercials and I'm going to now attempt very badly and Australian accent. Okay. Then most people hate, probably couldn't tell the difference between the British and Australian. Anyway, talking about the same. I know, I get it, I get it. And he said, um, apparently there's some bloke he's going around saying, if you eat too much of our food and don't take any exercise, you get fat. Well, I could've told you that. I just got really sweet response, which is, yeah, we'll have something that's not good, but a little bit's okay. That's a quite Australian

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       response to as opposed to the measured American legalees that you'd probably hear from [inaudible]. Good. Yeah. Yeah. You know I have a real issue with that documentary and with, he did a show also called 30 days because I know what they're doing there. They're not necessarily just investigating, right? They're also trying to achieve a desired result and that desired result being something bad. They're, they're trying to do something that's going to be titillating and oh my goodness, his liver is going bad. Like he's, he's sick, he's sick, he's toxic. There's a lot of people that have called bullshit on that, especially the liver toxins and all that stuff. They're like, where's this? Where's the liver toxin? You're dealing with carbohydrates and proteins and you know, and, and fats, but it's not like this. These things aren't toxic. They're just not good. They're just high in cholesterol and they're kind of fatty and sugary.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Yup. But I know for a fact that they did some fuckery on his show. He had a show called 30 days where he's trying to achieve the same results because they went to a friend of mine who's a doctor and he, this doctor specializes in hormone replacement therapy for older people, for older people and people that are, you know like you start getting older, you want to replace your testosterone and things along those lines and they wanted to do it in 30 days and they wanted to do it on this program. Take a man who's getting older and in 30 days injected with hormones and the doctor who's an ethical doctor said, you don't ever do that. He said, we'd never do that. And he said, well we would do is we would get you on a proper diet. I would take your blood, it would take a week to get your blood results back.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       I get your blood results back. I'd want to get a detailed analysis of what you're eating, what you're doing, what kind of a lifestyle do you have. It's not a simple fix like we give you hormones. So what they did is they found a quack doctor who did just shoot the guy up with hormones and the guy was like, oh, roid rage and angry afterwards and his fucking was wife wanted to keep him chubby. I mean the whole thing was a disaster. It was like, this is not an ethical examination of this. It makes it real. It's, it's like it's entertainment. It's not a documentary or something. It's deceiving though. The problem with entertainment is it's not a puppet show. Okay. It's not a cartoon. You're, you're pretending that you're exploring these ideas. And when I was doing that Scifi show, I found some similar issues with certain producers and certain people who were used to that world of reality TV reality TV has become this very strange mishmash of choreographed choreograph scenarios and predetermined scenarios, predetermined results. And they do it sort of in this guise of reality TV. But it's sir, it's essentially, it's like loosely scripted bullshit. Yeah. And they're pretending that it's like, this is what's going on in the doctor's office. No, you set that up. That's not what goes on at a doctor's office. It's not what would go on at a doctor's office. You're pretending because that's going to get people to freak out. They took the an agenda,

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       you know, they're trying to make a point and they set up like that. They edit it like that. It's, you know, it's totally right. Well, the whole business is completely fucked because the business has started off with a bunch of people that came over from scripted shows. So the legacy people that were involved in these dramatic shows where there were no, until survivor came along, there were no reality shows, quote unquote reality shows. So I go, I have a deep understanding of this because I hosted fear factor for six years and because fear factor came in in 2002 which was when all the reality shows were being born. So I got to see where these people had their backgrounds from and almost all of them had their backgrounds from traumas or from sitcoms or from the world of fictional shows. So much so that you were considered to be like a trader if you were involved in reality show, like people, people got mad at me that saying that I was taking jobs away from a writers because I was involved in, in reality shows.

Speaker 4:          00:18:48       And I was like, oh, this is hilarious argument. But these people all came from this world where you manipulate things in order to make drama. So they started doing that to the quote unquote reality shows. So that's what you're getting. So this 30 days show that doesn't exist anymore and supersize me show there, you know, you're tackling very complex issues and you're doing it and it to entertaining form. And when you do that, there's some integrity that's sort of like, it goes by the wayside. But I think that's right. And that integrity, I think I had a real example of that. You, in the end, you're relying on the people involved to have a bit of integrity and ethics and the way they do their jobs. And I just saw little example this weekend I was out doing stuff and I did, uh, to do with the election.

Speaker 4:          00:19:37       In my company. And we did a, I did an interview for the local news, NBC News, and we were doing some demos of stuff with people in Santa Monica and um, they wanted to film one of the people that were doing it with, you know, interacting with our thing. Right. But with our website and at that point, no, they weren't any people interested in doing that. So one of the teams said, why don't we just pretend to be a member of the public doing it? And it's really interesting because they said, no, the producer and the Gen, they said, no, no, it's going to be, you know, a real member of the public. And I thought that was really cool. You know, they, they obviously want it to go, they were busy. They had to get back to the studio. They were really annoyed that they're having to wait a long time for an actual member of the public.

Speaker 4:          00:20:20       But they really did say no, we were not going to fake it. And it would've been so easy and no one would have noticed. And in that moment, it was literally just that personal integrity. And it was really cool to see. And I, I hope that's really widespread in the news business, but it was just for me, a really interesting example of you can make rules and you can have stuff, but in the end it's about people and their choices in the moment. It is interesting that they chose to do that with integrity, but it's also interesting that someone suggested

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       they'd not. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And that's the, that's the other side of it. But it was, I was really pleased that that's what they decided to do. I did a show for CBS wants, um, called game show in my head. And the, uh, the premise of the show was you would have this little earpiece in that someone could talk to you in. So I would put an ear piece in the contestants and send them out. And when they would be standing somewhere, I'd say, okay, can you hear me? And they say, yes. All right, here's what's going on. And then these two guys came in with cameras that were holding cameras. You are a reporter on the news. Here's your scenario. Someone called in a Ufo sighting. They saw a Ufo sighting. We brought in the cameras. Unfortunately that person went away. So when you have to do is convince some member of the public that's around there to take that person's place and to say that they were the ones who saw this Ufo and you have to get them to say that they were taking a board this Ufo and that they were examined by aliens.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       And so the guy, you know, it was, it was kind of funny. They're like, okay, here we go. All right, how do I do this? What was shocking was how many people when you put that camera on them immediately said they would do it and immediately started just lying. Just lying. It was a silver craft. I mean, all walks of life. Uh, very few people said no. That was the most shocking thing when you had the camera on them. They just started talking and they started sort of repeating these iconic images that you always hear. The discs shape things, silver with knee, there was no bolts on it. They, they were like going into detail talking about though the medical examinations and, and this, this guy who I think it was a guy and a girl, um, you know these contestants who had to do this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       We're just talking to these people and we will all the producers in the truck, we're all looking at each other like, wow, people are fucking full of shit. This is so weird. It's so weird how easy it is for some people to just justify making up a story just in order for them to be on camera. But what did you think? It's because they just, it's the camera they want to be on the camera was that they want to please the other person. They want to be on TV. Look clever. It could be that as well. But I think most likely it's, they want to be on television so they could go home, set their DVR and you know, it's on it. It's not an Automaton, that's me. I have fucking lion, you know, they just wanted to be on television. I think for a lot of people in this day and age, that is just some sort of a weird, ultimate goal.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       Just to have that camera on them and then they go home and see it. Right. Whether it makes sense or not. And for a lot of folks, it doesn't make sense. A lot of folks, you know, they wind the winds up ruining their lives. You know, they, they find out how other people feel about them. Plus you expose yourself to the critique of millions of anonymous people filled with hate, filled with hate and disappointment their own life and just ready to spew venom in your direction. They just can't win that shit all over you, Steve Hill. Well, this is the judge you

Speaker 5:          00:24:00       this, we had another thing this weekend. We went out and made a little film just to test that out about the elections going on in, in, in La. And we literally went up to people and, um, made up candidates that were running for Congress and a nice, what they thought about that, you know, and what do you think of Angelina Jolie running for Congress? And they towed it. Yeah. This is guide. Yeah. I was so excited when I heard that. That's great. You know, I think she's great and it just, you can't believe how people just engage with these things. This is made, it just made it up and they just went with it. Like you were saying with the Ufo thing, he was like going on about it. It wasn't just saying, yeah, I heard about that. That's great. He was sort of embellishing it. Just ridiculous. Yeah. People are fucking strange man. That's strange range

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       and that's um, it's a real problem when it comes to politics or anything. When you're allowing people to make choices that can affect others. People are weird, you know, and a good percentage of them are really dominant, uninformed and not interested. I mean they, when you say dumb and uninformed, here's what I think when I say that, what, when I'm saying dumb, what I mean is if the human mind is a essentially a say, if everyone has the exact same physical structure, the exact same genetics, exact same hormonal system, and one person does yoga every day and eats healthy and does chin ups in the morning when they wake up and drinks a lot of water and the other person sits in front of the TV, likes to smoke cigarettes, eats nothing but sugar, you get to see the results of the one person being very aware of their body and taking care of their body and the other person not.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       Will you get that same effect with the life? You get that same effect with how you approach the world itself. Some people approach the world through this lazy, disconnected, you know, like pop culture obsessed, nonsensical, just pop culture obsessed. Jamie talking to you, you fuck, he's a little pop culture, so not too bad. Jamie's aware of a lot of other shit too, but some people just, they don't enrich their life. They don't enrich their mind. They don't. They're not. They're not curious. And those people with all these poor decisions and drug addictions and the life's a mess, they have an equal say to the person who's rational and aware and kind and objective, equal say, and I think that's one of the weirdest things about communities, about culture. It's about to figure out how do you mitigate the effects of the lazy. How do you, how do you deal with the effects of the morons?

Speaker 1:          00:26:51       Like when, when you have a riot and people start pulling white people out of cars and throwing rocks at their heads, which they've had in Los Angeles in the past, especially after the Rodney King beating and things along those lines, just random white people just attack them. How do you, how do you, how do you allow when you see these things can happen and then just use that and it's an example. It could be a million other things that are really stupid that people do. How could it be that one person gets one vote and another person who is very aware, another person is very educated. Another person who's very kind and very sympathetic to all walks of life gets an equal vote. One person could be a total racist. You could, you could go to a voting booth with a tee shirt on that says fuck black people and you could vote and no one could stop you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       You know, as long as you, especially if you have a shirt, sort of like a flannel shirt that's over the t shirt that says fuck black people. So you have to really look hard to see fuck black people and you think you're getting over. No one can stop you. You know? And it's, I think one of the things that they were trying to work around when they developed the concept of a representative democracy there, the concept of America representative government. So like, okay, let's sort of have some filters in place when you're voting, but you're kind of voting on a representative and the representative sort of votes

Speaker 5:          00:28:17       and they interpret what you want. I think that's, that's definitely part of the idea. I think that when you, I mean that, that point you just made about the, it really reminds me actually the racist point you mentioned made there was a really effective commercial for rock the vote. I remember years ago in the, in the UK when I was back there at the time and they, they literally had a some image of, I wasn't images like uh, a TV ad of a ray of the racist guy, like spewing racist stuff. And then the, the, the tagline for the ad was you'd better vote cause you can be sure that he will. And it was a really, you know, good way of making that point. But I think that generally, you know, those kind of people, are they extreme? I think the idea is that most people are not, you know, the kind of extreme end of it where they're either totally and where their views are just completely abhorrent or they are just completely off the page in terms of their knowledge. You got, you know, majority of people who are basically interested in good things happening. I think the problem is they just don't know enough about it. They're, the information they get is not interesting. It's not presented in a good way. There's other interesting things going on. They're busy with their life, you know, they want to get involved. And so what happens, and I think this is happening more and more, is you end up with a smaller and smaller group of people who basically control the political system because the, the massive

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       people are just not interested. They're turned off. They think that getting involved, what make any difference. And so what you end up with is people with a lot of money, special interests, those who, you know, that kind of professionals of the political game running everything. And that actually makes people even less inclined to get involved because they see what's happening thing. Oh, well why should I bother? It's a really bad cycle, I think. Yeah. And then people start saying things like, all the new world order's and control anyway, the Bilderberg group is in control anyway. And there was some, a thing yesterday that was in the news where one of the, uh, members of the Bilderberg Group, uh, in, I think he used some Dutch guy, had some impromptu public discussion with all these people and they start bringing out all these details of nine, 11, nine, 11, those, the building was brought down thermite and they stay and they circled this guy and started talking to them.

Speaker 4:          00:30:36       And it's, it's kind of fascinating, you know, this, this idea of the Illuminati, the, this idea of a small group of people controlling everyone through iconic symbolism, eyeballs inside of pyramids and all that stuff becomes a, in a lot of ways, a vehicle for, um, for feeling unempowered that we're feeling. That's existing franchised. That's what's good. I think that's, that, that's how people feel. I certainly noticed, I used to work back in the UK and the government and I noticed it that I've been in politics a long time. That's how people feel that it's even more so here. I think, you know, if you just look today with speaking on election day in California's the primaries, everyone's saying it's going to be the lowest turnout ever known, was interested because they don't think it makes any difference. I think that's a real problem. And then they feel, you know, the whole idea of democracies is people power is that you have the power.

Speaker 4:          00:31:30       Everyone had, like you was saying, everyone has the same chance to influence things and they have the power, but that is not what it feels like to people. And then every now and then something comes along with it. Like, how the hell did that pass? And then they freak out exactly like proposition eight, where they repealed gay marriage. And everybody's like, are you fucking kidding me? In California, you've appealed gay marriage. The most shocking thing about proposition eight to me was that over almost over the, the majority, uh, of, of black people voted for it. They voted to my heel. Gay Marriage. They didn't want gay marriage, which is, you know, quite hilarious if you started thinking about people that have been persecuted, I mean, who has been a victim of unfair discrimination in this country more than black people probably know. I don't know because um, I wasn't involved in any way, but I've heard that when you look at the date, exactly to your point, that that was one of the reasons, and that was particularly the case because it was in the ea when Obama was running and you had a high turnout amongst those people.

Speaker 4:          00:32:34       Precisely because you have the first black candidate on the ballot for president. So had more black people voting

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       and that was one of the consequences. Yes, 70% I don't know if that's right, but that's certainly what some have argued. Do you know how crazy 70% that's the exit polls said 70% of black people voted for proposition eight. That's stunning. The idea being for a lot of them, that is, it was, it was a religious decision. Yeah. I think that was a big, that was a big part of the story that's told someone should tap challenge that and uh, what they should do is they should make some sort of a proposition banning shrimp, you know, like have like have like these big signs in front of Red Lobster, you know, with genesis, like whatever, whatever the quote in the Bible that says your, because there's four times as many references to shellfish as there is to gay people. It was like, this isn't like a lot of references to like you're not supposed to eat shrimp, but you can go to an all unique buffet and people right after church.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       That's really how we allow it. You're right, it needs to be stopped. It's bad, but they can't, for whatever reason, the gay thing like really locked on to people. Like they really got into it. They really got into it for whatever reason, you know, the, the gay, the gay decision, the decision to stop gay marriage seemed to be like a one that Jesus was really serious about that shrimp thing. Then pick a tooth, pick and choose, you know, you're not supposed to get tattooed how many religious people have crosses tattooed on their body. I mean, that's a fucking, that's like directly, no, I didn't know that. Oh yeah. Tattoos not, yeah. Upon, yeah. You're not supposed to mark yourself. Okay. You're not supposed to tattoo yourself. That's, that's against God's wish. But people will tattoo themselves with biblical verses, which is, you know, hilarious. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       Well people are weird. You know, and my point that I was trying to make kind of clumsily earlier was that it's kind of strange that we are so varied and it's kind of strange that everyone does get, like if there's three of us in a room, you know, we, we have to, we all have to all decide. And uh, if one of us is retarded, I mean, not literally, but are people with down syndrome or people that are anyone that has like mentally compromised? Are they allowed to vote? I mean, there's, there's some sort of a test if you apply that. I didn't know what the rules are. I think in, in the, in the, in Britain, it was something to do with, I think the only thing was if you in jail, I can't remember. Well, if you're a felon in America, we don't ever let you recover. We don't ever let you recover from that. So if you're a felon, you don't get to vote. Yeah. You fucked up too much. What? You never can. No, I don't believe so. Fell. I'm pretty sure it felons don't get to vote because Joey Diaz always talks about that. Don't get to vote. I know they can't carry firearms. Yeah. State felon laws.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Um, I guess it looks like it's different in every state. Two states allow felons to vote from prison, while other states may permanently prevent felons from voting even after being released. So it's different. It varies from state to state. It's amazing. Permanently prevent. Yeah. They lose, uh, they vote. They cannot vote permanently. In 11 states. Uh, Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, Tennessee. W coincidentally, all places I would never fucking live. How Weird, Huh? Yeah. You're worried about the rules? I think the, um, that is amazing to me that there's this assumption that there's no chance you get on can I cut back? You don't turn it around. You never make a felony when you're 18. Like some stupid thing. You go to jail, you come out and become like the best person ever and they're never going to let you return. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          00:36:42       I mean the whole point of what you try and do with the criminal justice system and so on is to try and exactly, you know, rehabilitate people so they don't offend again. I mean that is, and try and get people to that point. Yeah. I think people were just so tired of people just fucking up that they're like, you know what? This is a good way to keep fuck ups from voting. Like once, like the idea that we were talking about earlier that, you know, a person could be a racist, the person could be a complete nutter and still vote along with a person who's really kind and educated and their vote counts equally. They're in a community that as soon as that nutter, rob something, it goes, it's a good way to cut them out of the system. All right, fuck that guy. You can't vote anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:37:26       Which I cast kind of makes sense, but maybe it's just a numbers thing. If there's 10 people on an island, we would have to rehabilitate. The guy was told the coconuts, we'd have to say, come on, man, you can't be stealing everybody's coconuts. This is a fucked up way to live your life. If you should contribute, stop stealing fish, stop stealing coconuts getting together and then we'd let that guy be a part of the case. By the way, I think it's an incredibly important point about about democracy generally. I think the closer it is to a real community where everyone knows each other, right? Where the decisions are made by people who can look the other person in the eye and well that I think they're going to be better. I think one of the problems is that you've got these big, big systems and that kind of really far from the human level where that kind of trust can be established and that is one of the problems with a lot of things in government and politics. It's all just too big and removed from that human scale. Well that's a problem with a lot of things when it comes to human beings. Just diffusion of responsibility that comes with being a part of a massive group like war. Yeah. The idea that if there's 300 million of us and a million of us or overseas, you know, fighting for freedom, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       that's sort of like you could deal with that because it's not happening in Calabasas. You know, you can, you could go to work and you get deal with your life and in your, the scope of your world, it doesn't come up. But you kind of peripherally aware at this is happening somewhere else. But if people in Van Nuys, we're going to war with people in studio city and it was only a couple miles away and you had to deal with that, then it would be something we would have to try to calm down. We'd have to try to deal with this. Like what? What the fuck's going on here? Like what are we doing here? We'd have to, it's, it's something that you have to deal with, but the sheer number of human beings that are involved in the world today and in communities and cultures, it's just, it's almost unmanageable.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       It's an unmanageable for a person who's not designed for that were designed essentially to deal with our immediate atmosphere. We're designed to deal with small tribes of people, friends, family, the people that you know, the people that you keep close and when you get past that, it's just like almost like, what do we, I don't know what to do with this. And so we pass the buck off to some representative. I think this is such an important point. I really do believe that. I think that so many things don't work because they get away from the point where you can really know the other person or the group that you're with. There's some guy, and I'm in England, I think it Cambridge University. It's in research about the maximum number of people that you can really have any kind of human relationship with anyone tiny. I think he got to a number of 150 Dunbar's number.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       Is that right? I see more about it than I do. I thought that was just a really interesting perspective on it, which is, which is that after that it just gets to diffuse. We're not designed for it. It's like your phone. Your phone's only has a certain amount of data. That old fucking goofy flip phone you carry around with you. If you have an older one, like when those Motorola star tax, you know, remember those from back in the day. Big fucking goofy, clunky thing. I mean that probably only carried a hundred phone numbers. I mean, I dunno how many of that, but the amount of data that you can store new devices represents the need that we have. But we have these same biological hard drives that cavemen did. I mean, they're not really much different than people that lived a million years ago. I mean, how much of it has it changed?

Speaker 1:          00:40:43       I mean, how many, how many, how much more room do we have for social relationships? Apparently not much. Like 50,000 years ago. And today, if you took a, a guy who lived 50,000 years ago and a guy who lived today and you compare the brains, how much would they vary? You could take a 50,000 year old man, dress him up in clothes and sit them down in a movie theater and you'd walk right by him. You wouldn't even know when you're sitting in your seat, you wouldn't go, Holy Shit, that's a fucking cave man. I mean, the guy would look very remarkably similar to how you look and I look and how normal folks look today. Yeah. We're not designed for this world that we've created and it's, it's popped up so damn quick. Yeah, exactly. It's really the last kind of, well definitely last a hundred years, but you know, again, it's just getting faster and faster. You know, this kind of everything becoming really kind of organize it, they sort inhuman

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       level

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       and this mad struggle to sort of organize it and to try to control it and just be, just calm it down, get a handle on the effects of it. And I think in a lot of ways that's what you're doing with this Crowdpac thing with this Crowdpac thing is you are utilizing these tools, these tools of the internet and this instant access to information that we have today to sort of establish a much clearer sense of where political candidates are coming from and what are their influences as far as who is financing them, where is, where is their money coming from, where their decisions headed towards what, what are they, what are they doing right now? No.

Speaker 5:          00:42:20       Yeah, I think that's, that's a really good summary of it, which is that basically we think that when you talk to people about politics, one of the things they say is that we just don't know enough about it. We don't know enough information generally, but we don't know. We don't have information we can trust. We have all this spin and ads and all the rest of it from the politicians. We cannot really believe them. There's all this stuff around on the Internet. I don't know what to believe. So what we're trying to do is give people really objective information that they can rely on to figure out where the politicians are on the issues that they care about. And the thing that we found from our research is that is my, um, uh, one of my cofounders, Adam, who's a professor at Stanford, um, has been working on this for for many years.

Speaker 5:          00:43:03       And basically what he's shown is that the best way to predict what a politician will do if they're elected is to look at where they get their money and to look at also who they give money to. Cause most politicians also going to donate to other candidates. So if you look at all that campaign finance information, the money behind this politician that is going to give you the best guide to what they're really going to do in office. And it's something that you can actually, what we're trying to do is like turn that into really simple information that you can without kind of reading tons of stuff and doing loads of research. You can get a quick snapshot of who these people are and then in time, the other thing that we want to do is make it possible for you to find the politicians that are really, um, good or bad on the issues that you care about and get involved in their campaigns.

Speaker 5:          00:43:52       Because the other thing is that you've got a tiny, tiny number of people who are funding these campaigns. If you look at the total number of people who put money into politics, it's a really small number compared to the number of people who've who vote. And then the number of adults in the whole country. It's a tiny number that are funding it all. And even within that, most of the money comes from an even smaller number and they're paying for all of this and they're getting the outcomes that they pay for. It's basically a transaction. That's what's really crazy and so some people say, right, you've got to get money out of politics. That's just got to get it out and obviously that is something that has a lot of appeal. You can see why you'd want to do that. There's a brilliant guy called Larry Lessig.

Speaker 5:          00:44:36       I don't know if you've come across what he's been doing and he's been arguing about this for years and he's been saying he's at Harvard. Harvard is that he's a brilliant campaign on this issue of money in politics. And he's been saying, if you think about any problem in, in America today, whatever the issue is that you care about, if that's gay marriage or the environment, or it doesn't matter what it is, you're not going to get anywhere about in terms of solving that problem unless you deal with the first problem, which is the money because the money in politics stops the proper solutions from being developed. Because what it means is that you've got these special interests, whether that's left or right, it doesn't matter whether it's big businesses or unions, doesn't matter. They want their particular outcome and they're buying it through the system.

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       So we've got to get the money out and he's got a campaign around that and he wants public funding for elections and so on and all that is kind of a noble aim, I guess. But my feeling is that that's a really hard sell because you've got a constitution that says it's free speech. You're allowed to give money to politicians, and we can't just kind of stop that. Um, you've got to let people donate to politicians. And so our take on it is to say, well, if you can't take the money out, let's at least dilute the influence of the people there right now by letting more people, making it easier for more people to get involved and give money to these candidates. So they are not dependent on these big donors with their particular interest. And that's really what we're trying to do is kind of make it easier for people to get involved in politics so that they can really, you know, get these politicians off this hook there on, which is that their, their dependence on these donors for their campaign spending, which means that once they're elected, it's kind of inevitable that they pay attention to them rather than the people who elected them

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       in Illinois. A lot of ways it mirrors the influence that the Internet has had on the news itself because the news used to be distributed only through these proper channels, whether it was NBC, CBS, and then, you know, the cable news networks, CNN, Fox and all this jazz. But now it's become this thing where websites develop. Huffington Post, all these, uh, young Turks, which is an internet based new show and they have no censorship, they have no restrictions, they have no influence other than the ones that they choose to accept or the ideas that they bring and they have the same amount of distribution that everybody else does. And you can have a website just, you know, Mike's fuckhead.com and put it up. And if enough people find it valid and interesting, he could have a million hits a day, unique visits a day. And it might be more than CNN gets. And just simply because of the fact that it's good information. It's, well, you've

Speaker 5:          00:47:26       shown that with this, I mean, you know, you're reaching more people

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       than the most of these, I think all of these news sites, right? 10 and a half million a month, like more than just about anything else, you know. So it's crazy as exponentially doubling and tripling. And what's happening is it's all being done with no promotion. No, the only promotion is like I let people know, hey, Steve Hilton's on today. And then, but just from, yeah, I mean that's good to hear that from Twitter and just spreading the word. But what I was getting at is that like the same way the Internet has sort of interfered with the distribution of information. Look at what's going on with his Edward Snowden case is a perfect example. This massive change in the way the entire country looks at the NSA and government spying was done by one man leaking information to one guy and one source which spread through the Internet and then boom, it blossoms is huge news story.

Speaker 4:          00:48:30       That was essentially, if he had sent that same story through the proper channels to like the New York Times or CNN, they would have nord the fuck out of it. They would have figured out a way to cover that thing and throw it under the rug and stable that rug down and light it on fire. I mean what he did was figure out a way to distribute things for this and through this new channel and essentially that's what the Internet is doing with with voting. Before something like the Internet came along, it was very difficult to find out who the influences of all these different individual candidates where with something like Crowdpac it becomes much more easy and that also will change the way these people interact with, you know, I really hope that that is, you know, we're just at the stumps of it to be honest.

Speaker 4:          00:49:17       I think the, the political world is really late for this kind of change compared to, like you say with media and other things and things that we experience every day in our lives. Like you know, like travel booking, you know that they used to be a time when, you know, to get an airline ticket you that's is have a physically go to some shop and then have these like weird paper to, you know, the whole thing just feels so antiquated and now it's so simple. It's really light. You were saying you've got the power to do it, you're empowered now. You get it on your phone. You don't even have to have a ticket. And that's got a phone over the scanner thing. That hasn't really happened to politics yet. But that is what we're trying to do because, and all this as well. It's not just us, but you know, I think that we've got something interesting here, which is this way of giving people objective information about the candidates based on who gives them money. But, but overall we're part of this movement of trying to really put power in people's hands through technology. And I'm sure it's going to happen. I'm really sure because people want it, you know, they all sick of just feeling that they don't get any response and these people have a had control everything and nothing ever really changes. And actually the politicians themselves, in my experience, they, you know, you'd think,

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       well maybe I would say this cause I used to work in politics myself for the prime minister in the UK. So I kind of know them. They kind of used to be my world that used to be my world. My feeling is that generally the politicians actually hate this just as much as everyone else. They hate the fact that they have to spend so much time raising money. You know, literally there was this document that was leaked to the New York Times, I think a while back from the democratic leadership in Congress where they gave a kind of guide to the newly elected members of Congress about how they should spend their time. And it was a recommendation to the newly elected members of Congress and it went through how much, how many hours a day they should spend with different types of activity. You know, thinking about policy, talking to constituents, there's going to be, half of the time it was four hours was recommended that they spend on fundraising.

Speaker 5:          00:51:22       Wow. Right. And so the people who go into policy, they don't want to live like that. They actually hate it. They hate, you know, being shoved in a room with is what happens and being, they call it dialing for dollars, you know, like just literally sitting on the phone trying to raise money. That's not why they went into politics. How do they do that? They just call random people up or do they have the list of potential donors give? I don't know cause I've never done it, but I think they, I think that's literally it. They're given less of likely people to

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       d Dee Dee Dee Dee, hi, I'm running for Congress in the 33rd district and now I'd like to get gay marriage the fuck Outta here. What do you think? I think

Speaker 5:          00:51:58       I'm pretty much like that. I don't know how to talk to some people who know more about it, but um, you know, so, so I think actually the politicians themselves and mostly hate the system. And so I think that, um, you know, in a lot of, there's a lot of effort actually in Congress to try and encourage more small donors and make it easier for people to give money because actually that that's what they want to, they don't like being beholden to these big donors and these companies and you know, they don't like it any more than we like it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       I think ultimately the idea of leaders, whether it's presidential leaders or whether it's a representatives, I think ultimately that's going to go away. And My, my thought about it is that anybody who really wants to lead everyone else is probably an asshole. You know? I mean, anybody who really wants to be the king, like why do you want to be the king? Like don't you have things to do? Don't you have hobbies and creative pursuits and like what, why would you want to just be the guy who gets to control be the one who stands at the podium, ladies and gentlemen. You know, that's, that's a weird ego thing. I think that in 2014 in the world that we live in today where we're seeing this much more even distribution of influence. Yeah. I think that ultimately that's going to be one of those things that gets called into question. Like, why do we have an Alpha representative? Why do we have to have this head and charge?

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       I really agree with it. I mean, a lot of the things that I was trying to do, uh, when I was in the government in the UK and, and, and it's kind of part of what we're doing with Crowdpac is, is you know, trying to encourage that even distribution that more even distribution upon redistribute power from that kind of traditional sources of power. And it's going to central leadership, putting power in people's hands so that they can control more and more aspects of their life because then the end they'll make better decisions overall. And it's also just be more healthy. I think going back to what we were saying earlier about, um, you know, the, the way people can only know a small number of people and, and if you give them power to shape more of the things that happened in their lives, I think that that actually they will take more responsibility.

Speaker 5:          00:54:12       They'll be more responsible in a community sense. You'll just see everything get better if you take power out of the hands of the sort of lead it leaders and central organizations and put it in the hands of people. Definitely. I think, I think you're right. I think there's also an issue of it being overwhelming. The amount of information that you have to absorb whenever you deal with political issues, whenever you deal with campaigns, whenever you deal with new elections, you know you're given this pamphlet of different people and the different propositions that are up for vote and you just get overwhelmed. Especially if you're, if you have a job that's taxing as it is and you have a family and you know you're thinking about golfing on the weekend, God and learned to go golfing and you're looking all this bullshit and like, oh, I can't even pay attention to this.

Speaker 5:          00:54:55       Is Everything okay right now? Yes. Well fucking let me just get this over with and let's hope everything stays okay. And very few people take responsibility for what gets voted in. Yeah, and it is, I think you're right though. It is really target. It's hard. It's easy to say, oh, the voters are lazy or whatever. They should. But honestly, like you said, they've got real lives to live and they haven't got time for all this stuff. And that is a really big part of why we want to make it simple. You know, we are assuming that people want to spend less time doing this stuff, not more time. And I think a lot of the kind of, um, organizations and people that have tried to get people mobilized, you know, civic organization and the kindness, that kind of thing, you know, it's, it's worked to a certain extent with some people, but for the majority of people, they just don't want to do it.

Speaker 5:          00:55:46       They can't do it. Actually. They're literally too busy, um, with things that are higher priorities, like their kids and their family and their job or whatever it may be. Hobbies doesn't matter. It's stuff that they choose to do and that's fine. That's their life. And we shouldn't kind of require that you have to spend ages figuring out this political stuff. And that's why we're trying to make it really simple for people, but based on quite a lot of comp. And that's what technology allows you to do. You can take quite a lot of complex data and information like we're doing with the campaign finance records, where it's literally hundreds of millions of pieces of information and we're boiling it down into one piece of information, which is a score like where is this candidate on the, on the scale of liberal to conservative, where do they sit and where are they on each issue? That's what we're trying to do to make it really simple,

Speaker 1:          00:56:36       isn't it sort of analogous in a way to what we were talking about, about the amount of people that you can keep in your brain that Dunbar's number is that if you lived in a small tribe, if safe, we all live 50 of us together in some small village somewhere, we really wouldn't have votes about gay marriage and we really wouldn't have quotes about, there'd be a million different things that would never be up for vote, and if someone really did start micro managing everyone's lives, he'd be like, Hey, you know, Mike is an asshole. We got to kick him out of this fucking tribe. This guy's trying to get people to wear purple and you know, where certain Nike's during different moon cycles and make tribal rules and rituals and make all these things standard. And you know, for whatever reason, he doesn't like men sleeping with men. Like he's got some weird thing, you know, he believes it's

Speaker 5:          00:57:23       so true. I just saw agree with that. One of my favorite things that um, one of the these experiments that happened was in Holland. I think I've got that right. Um, in, in, in Europe. And they did this brilliant experiment with traffic where they, um, in a town, I think it was Friesland or something like that, probably got that wrong. Um, where they literally took away all the traffic signals, all of them, everything, right? They took away traffic lights, they even took it, you know, stop signs, everything, even the, the markings on the road. So they took away the white line in the middle of the road, everything all gone. And their theory was that without that kind of external rule making and kind of stuff going on to tell you what to do, people would have to kind of relate to each other as other people and just figure it out amongst themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:58:14       So they would, um, you know, have to look other people in the eye and, and sort of work it out between them. And they found they had this brilliant effect, which was that um, accidents fell to zero. The traffic improve, the traffic speed was lower, but the traffic flow was much better. It just worked all around, all the kinds of things that you try and do when all these people thinking about traffic planning and whatever, they achieved all those aims by literally taking everything away and just allowing people to relate to each other as humans and earth rules. I thought it was such a great little story and I think that you could do that in all sorts of areas. If you just leave it to people to figure it out on a small scale where they can relate to each other, you just get a much better result.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       Isn't that the issue though? The small scale we're dealing with, I drove here today. I live about 20 minutes from here and in the drive from my house to here, I didn't know anybody. I don't know any of those fucking people. They might not even be real. They might be robots that were sent from the government to pretend the MSA again, Haley, and he would maybe even the, I don't know them, you know? So there there's, there's, there's that issue, whereas everyone in Friesland or wherever the fuck that place was in Holland, those, those people probably all know each other. You know, it's a small area. There's not a lot. When you get to some weird number, like the 20 million people that are live in the greater Los Angeles area, that's too crazy. It's too, it's too nutty and there's nothing less human than a light.

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       A stop light. Red Means Stop. Green means go wait, look at it. It's green. Go. I mean, it's so disconnected from human interaction and without it we become crippled. There's no better chance that you're going to run into a traffic stop or a traffic jam. Then if a cop is directing, if there's a cop, it's standing there telling you people go forward, then you people stop. For sure. That guy's fucking, that intersection up sideways. Every time I go into one of those situations where a light is down and there's a cop standing there, it's a fucking disaster. Whereas if it was just a light, if just red light, green light, everything seems to work cause we're sort of program to wait for that light and then go to it. You just, yeah, you can follow that up. That cop is, they're like, oh this mother fucker. I look at it, no wonder this thing's a mess.

Speaker 1:          01:00:40       It's a person out there telling us when we can go fuck him. Who's he asshole fat fuck telling me when to go and you know, and there's this weirdness involved and all of a sudden there's a human element that's been thrown into our robot light thing. And then there's a, you know, there's cameras that they were putting on them for a while, which were hilarious on the actual cups. No, no, no, no. On the lights because they are doing that too. I think on the cops. Yeah, they should. They should do that on all cops because she'd do that on all cops. Everything a cop does all throughout the day should be recorded and it should be untamperable though they shots that. I genuinely think that's what they're trying to do. So much abuse. It's, there's just massive amounts of abuse when it comes to police officers.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       And I think there's a lot of great cops out there. There's not that I don't believe in law enforcement, but I believe many of them are abusive fucks and many of them are psychologically unable to deal with the demands of an incredibly stressful life. Yeah, it's really tough. I completely agree with the way you put it, that there's tons of them, the great, and then the others, the totally abused that position. And that's another really interesting example of how technology can be really helpful, um, in a way, because you can, you can have the, I think I got told that they're trying to do in here the LAPD, that if you put the cameras on and you can't mess around with them, that's a really powerful incentive. Huge to behave. Right. Complaints have dropped dramatically and they've dropped dramatically cause cops can't be contained anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       I mean it's really that simple. It's really, it really is that simple. What I was talking about was that at traffic traffic lights, right. They were having lights. Like if you were going through the light as it was yellow and it turned red, they would flash. So if your wheels, we're not, you know, it was, if they were in front of the line, you hadn't made it across before the light turned red. They would give you a ticket and, but it would turn out to be a private company that was actually profiting from these tickets. And so they deemed that unconstitutional and they were removed all those lights. But people were just in a goddamn uproar. It was just madness. Everywhere you go, they're taking, you'd see flashes going off at traffic lights and all, it was his revenue. It wasn't preventing people from running lights are preventing people from, you know, gunning it when the light turns yellow.

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       It was just just fucking people out of their money. And it was just one more thing where they complicate the system for the add one more element that makes it one more thing that you have to think about. One more little piece of control and one more dehumanizing aspect. People like freedom and one of the reasons why people like freedom is because freedom isn't just the freedom to do as you wish. It's the freedom to not have to think about a bunch of other shit and be influenced by a bunch of other shit that takes your time away and takes your energy away. And I think that's where we're at when it comes to a lot of these propositions and a lot of these really Uber complicated things that are involved in our day to day lives. It's like we've complicated ourselves to this point of almost of no return and where there's very few, very few

Speaker 5:          01:03:50       Turnitin. Yeah. I think that the thing that happens then is that they've complicated it, then it's not working and here's how we can better try and fix it. And then the fixing of it makes it even more complicated and it just gets that. And then a new government comes in or a new governor or whoever it may be. And instead of actually just stopping and thinking, you know what, this whole, we just got to rethink the whole thing and start from scratch and um, and just not tinker with it anymore and try and improve it because it's just going to make it more complicated. That never happens. There's never really enough time for that to happen. They're not there. They were only thinking about the next couple of years in the next election or whatever. And so things just get even more complicated and they never, they never seem to get to that point weapon. Yeah, that's really working. Great. Now my wife and I went out to this restaurant the other night and the restaurant was this, we were noticing that there's this theme that's going on and a lot of restaurants where they have like this rustic thing going on where they have old school lights, the filaments in them.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       Then they have hardwood tables and rot iron this and metal that. And, and I was like, I think people are sort of reacting to this fabricated world that we've created and we long for this simplicity. That's why there's these shows like, um, these Alaska shows where people living on the frontier and they're fucking collecting wood and fighting off wolves. It's like we almost long for that simplicity of above this world. We've complicated to this almost unmanageable point.

Speaker 5:          01:05:21       Yeah, it's definitely true. And you see and in so many errors that, I mean it's like food is a, is a great example where there's all this kind of stuff about organic food and seasonal and local and grow in your garden. And that whole movement I think is a reaction. I mean if you think about food like years ago, like in the 50s, I think, you know, it was all about um, you know, let's have, you know, those are the kind of TV package, food and all this kind of industrialized food that was then seen as better because it was scientific and hygienic and like really kind of good for you. And then people are now just thinking that it's just really horrible. This is all the chemicals. It's disgusting. Now the movement is all for this kind of, uh, local organic food. It made me laugh though because my family from Hungary and so when I was a kid, we used to go back to Hungary the whole time.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       It was a communist country and there were no food stores with loads of choice and everything. And you would go in the store and it was just, you know what? You got just a few sort of vegetables and it was, it was just very basic. Um, and now, but the other day walking around in San Francisco and there's the kind of farmer's market thing going on and they had their kind of ugly vegetables and whatever put out there and it just looked exactly like the Hungarian communist, the food shop. But here in San Francisco, it's the most expensive, fancy, amazing food that you can get. But it just makes me laugh. Really. It's, I think a lot of it is just, you know, you know, a reaction to what's gone before and we're currently, I think you're totally right in this kind of sense of he's just gone too far. The whole, um, industrialization of so many different aspects of our lives. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       it's also, we're starting to realize where people live in cities and they, they look around and they see all these buildings and they see this asphalt and they see these telephone poles and they go, there's no food here. We have to bring in the food. Like this is kind of crazy. Like, and then you'd get on top of a building and you look around and how far the no food here area is. It's pretty God damn big. And then you look at all the different people that live in the no food here area that require food. He like, fuck, we got to feed these fucking people. And then you go, where's this water coming from? And then you go, oh, it comes from Colorado. What's the water comes from fucking what it's comes from the Colorado River. Oh No. So the only way we get water in California is we have to take it from thousands of way, thousands of miles away.

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       That's the only, this is a crazy place to be. Like we w, W, W we're in this unsustainable environment and New People move here every day. New thousand people every day. Bump, bump, bump, set up a fucking house, built this, another structure, boom. And then we slowly push out our no food here, area deeper and deeper into the desert. And you know, no one's thinking about where this goes. And so far so good, sustainable, go to the farmer's market. You can get plenty of good groceries, but very bizarre if there's somehow another, some cutoff of our oil supply, some, some way where we can't travel as easily anymore. We're in a real rut. It's not a good spot. It's not, ideally every neighborhood should have like a couple of acres where it's set up where you grow food like that. W Community Garden.

Speaker 5:          01:08:36       Totally agree with that. There's a, there's a brilliant guy. Um, I don't know if you come across and go with Nassim Taleb. He wrote this book called the Black Swan, and he's, he was really, um, he's a, he's a mathematician and he was in the financial markets and, and he really kind of predicted the crash and understood all that and he's just great. And one of his big points is that these big systems that we've ended up with, um, the word he uses our, they'd completely fragile. They're really, they look kind of big and, and, and uh, solid. But actually we're so dependent on them that it makes us really fragile. If they collapse or fall over or whatever, whether that's a company or some government system, we really screwed because that we're so dependent and that's really a kind of fragile situation. And so that's, that's definitely one of the reasons I sort of love what he writes about and talks about is that he's arguing for exactly that kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          01:09:27       You know, making sure that companies don't get too big to fail, not just in the financial sector. A lot of people have talked about that with the banks is too big to fail argument, but in every area with the food system. And other types of businesses where we're so dependent. If something went wrong we, you know, we couldn't cope with it. And when you have small distributed, it's just like we were talking earlier about the power of being distributed is not just voting power and political power, its economic power, it's social path. Every type of power. It's just going to be much better for us if it's distributed more broadly and we're a long way from that. It's actually going in the other direction.

Speaker 1:          01:10:02       Yeah it's going the other direction and very few cities are diminishing and population. Unless there's something horribly wrong like Detroit where it, if I, have you ever been to Detroit? Have not. It's fascinating. While you were over here in America and you're, you're enjoying our fine country, you should go see our biggest disaster, cause Detroit at one point in time was this economic stronghold for America. It's where we built Camaro's and Corvettes and Firebirds and it was this place where it was where America built what it built best, which is besides buildings, it's cars in America built cars and it all fucking fell apart. It fell apart when they started moving jobs to Mexico and all the other countries, it fell apart when they started producing shittier and Shittier cars. And when there was all sorts of complications with unions and with a million different problems.

Speaker 1:          01:10:59       And then slowly but surely they started diminishing these, these factories. And there's a really interesting documentary, I don't know if you've watched Michael Moore's first documentary, Roger and me. Did you ever see that? Roger and me was all about Flint. Michigan was about his hometown where they closed down these plants and then these people went into immediate, massive poverty and it was a huge, huge issue. And if you go to Detroit today, you could buy a house for $500 and I'm not bullshitting. They had houses for sale. I was there 500 bucks. And it's a mess. It's a real mess. I mean there, there's in areas where they're trying to gentrify these areas and they're building local businesses and they're trying to, you know, encourage growth. And you know what I mean? If a company wanted to move there, they have a massive amount of people that are looking for jobs and cheap land and it's a good idea.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       It's a good place to start, but very, very difficult to encourage people to do so. So Detroit shows how easy things can fall apart. Yeah. And there's been a bunch of blogs that have been created where they've, uh, websites where they have shown how these trees and nature are taking over these areas that used to be populated where trees are growing those pills. It's amazing. I remember that now. Yeah. Bears, bears are moving into these areas that used to be at least to have, you know, towns and bears are slowly started moving their way into Detroit and it's fucking crazy. And he'd say, yeah, but that's, that shows you how easily it could all fall apart. Whereas, you know, 50, 60 years ago, here's some, here's an image of Jamie just put up, these are trees that are growing inside of this abandoned building. It just growing through the floor.

Speaker 1:          01:12:40       And eventually they'll make their way through the roof and the roof will rot. And it just shows you how easy it is for nature to reclaim areas that human beings feel like of, well this is a city now. Now it's the city for now. You know, it's not a city now. It's not permanently a city like this is trees just go. You ever, um, go to the airport, drive down. Supolvida there's areas where it's really old roads in these trees have grown up through the sidewalks so bad that the sidewalks are, you know, you can't walk on them. I mean they're, they're like ramps because the tree has slowly but surely lifted up the concrete of the sidewalk and it's trying to reclaim this area. They've put this stupid rock paste over. Yeah. You know, I think that's like one of the best examples of how easy it could all fall apart at that point about being dependent on, on something.

Speaker 1:          01:13:37       Yeah. But it's, it's interesting cause you got a lot of, and I've loved going around other and getting to know other American cities. I mean they, I mean that's a bad example. You've got some really great cities, you know, the, that seems to be thriving and working and that's just really cool places to live and work. I love Chicago. I thought it was an amazing car, was fantastic. Then you've got huge problem with the, it's just so interesting how you have a city that is so great in so many ways and that, and they've got this, this, this sort of pocket of real poverty and crime and that's been going on for years and despite all the other advantages and they got a lot of, you know, great economic growth going on there and so on and people visiting and it's great, but they still got this PR, this entrenched problem with crime and gun violence and um, you know, it's just, it's interesting how, how long it takes for some of these prompts to be worked out.

Speaker 1:          01:14:29       Yeah, Chicago is a disaster in that sense. It's a great city, but it's also a disaster in the sense of crime and gang violence. And I was there, I was talking to this guy who was a cop and he was explaining it to me that a big problem is the drug trade and that certain gang members were incarcerated and because they were incarcerated they created a vacuum that was, there was a power struggle to try to fill the vacuum. That power struggle started this sort of violent war going on between all these different criminal factions. And then you know, it builds up and you know, he was really kind of interesting cause he was talking about, he goes, you know the best way to fix it, he goes legalized drugs and he goes, nobody wants to hear about it. But the reason why they're making all this money is because they're selling something that's illegal.

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       And so when you're selling something that's illegal, the only people that are doing that are the people that are criminals. And he goes, as soon as you make it legal, you can deal with a personal choice issue. And the guy was like very rational about it and he was like, you're dealing with a personal choice issue instead of a crime issue. But I think that's exactly right. I think it said one of the more kind of interesting ways into that whole drug legalization argument is, is to think about the, the social problems that come from the current rules. Not just, you know, a lot of times people talk about the drug use being the social problem, but actually it's everything that comes from it, the crime and the gangs. And, and that's, I think, you know, the, the most intelligent argument. Full legalization. Yeah. And there was a real interesting article recently about Mexico.

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       They were talking about the cartels like hemorrhaging money because they relied on marijuana trade and now with legal marijuana, just the legal marijuana in Colorado and in Washington state, and then all the medical places have massively diminished the amount of influence that these guys have of the amount of wealth that they can get from selling illegal drugs. Cause people don't need it anymore. It's just super easy to get. So like the marijuana trade, which is one of the most common drugs, it's kind of drying up for them. And so they're scrambling to try to find some other avenues of revenue. It's pretty interesting stuff because it's just shows people like this is, this is what you do when you make things illegal and it's, we should have figured it out in the 1920s with prohibition. I mean, it's amazing that people are so goofy today that they still are or are dealing with the same issue that they kind of resolved in the 1920s you almost a hundred years ago, they figured this out with alcohol and they have to relearn the same lesson with, uh, with cannabis. It's just, it's nutty and it's, again, it's another thing where it's a personal issue where you have just too many God damn laws. You have too many restrictions on personal for. Exactly right. And it's interesting,

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       I think that the, the politicians have been put off for a long time from, from doing anything about it, by the kind of reaction that they'll think they'll get from certain parts of the price and so on. But actually I think that's changing and it's changing really quickly here in America. And the fact that you've got these ballot measures that are winning in different states and that's just going to accelerate, I think,

Speaker 1:          01:17:30       not just that, the amount of revenue they pull in with no resistance whatsoever. Colorado has 39% tax revenue on marijuana that's sold recreationally, 39% and everyone there is like, okay, 39% is cool. They'll be like, no one's arguing over the most preposterous sales rate ever that that is 39% is fucking crazy. It's basically the government is a drug dealer. I mean that's what it is. I mean, so you're not just taking taxes, you're fucking a partner. You're a partner in this 39% is a big partner. You're at almost 40% okay. And then they're making over a hundred million dollars a year in tax revenue just in the state of Colorado. So when that kind of money starts coming in, then they, that money has influence and then they have to respect the pot dollar because the pot dollar is going to be a lobby. Just like anything else, just like the pharmaceutical lobby, just like the natural resource lobby.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       Just like anything else, the pot lobby's going to be legit now because there's going to be a tremendous amount of revenue available and big business there. There's a big businesses that are moving into Colorado right now and establishing warehouse warehouse spaces in Colorado are just, they're evaporating, they're disappearing left and right because people just picking them up and they were, the way Colorado's laws are set up, in order to sell marijuana, you have to grow marijuana, so if you wanted to open up a shop in Colorado, you'd have to grow your own stuff and then sell it. You can't buy it from someone else and then sell it. So they're just giant warehouses everywhere of being scooped up and they're setting up these massive grow ops and then they're funneling that money because it's being sold legally to funneling that money right back in the state at a rate of 39%. It's crazy and huge companies are slowly but surely creeping their way towards Colorado because they realize this is, this is a multibillion dollar industry and just a couple of years, you're looking at three, four, five years from now, a multibillion dollar industry, nationwide cut places where they're having serious money being issues, serious problems with generating tax revenue. All of the sudden all the profits that are going to illegal sales of marijuana, now 39% of that money is gonna come right to the taxpayers are a right to the tax

Speaker 5:          01:19:49       blunders. And if they got any, um, I guess it's a bit early, but I was just wondering what the, what they're seeing in terms of people's behavior that usage,

Speaker 1:          01:19:58       lower crime, the other drug, is that right? Lower crime and lower murder rates. Murder rates have dropped in Denver. Yeah, of course they're high. It's an eye they're to, they're going to get twice. Well, they're going to think twice. They're gonna think about it. I don't need the sheet. That guy's an asshole, but whatever. It's his problem. You know? Look, it's, it's never good to suppress people. And when you have something that's irrational, like marijuana laws, there's it, it gives people this feeling of frustration. Does this disconnect? It gives them this feeling of being disenfranchised with the, the people that are supposedly in charge, you know? And it makes them upset. Like, why should a grown man be able to come? If it was only two of us, we were living on an island and I was like, Steve, I don't think you should smoke pot.

Speaker 1:          01:20:43       If you smoke pot, I'm gonna lock you in a fucking cage. He'd be like, you're an asshole. Right? Like there's only two. What do you give a shit? What I do, it's when there's 2 million of us that you feel like you can get away with. Something like that, that someone could come along and say, I'm the sheriff. And if I find someone's smoking marijuana and my district, I'm going to put them under lock and key and I'm going to make our streets safe for the children. All that stupid shit that they say, well it's just too many numbers, too many people.

Speaker 5:          01:21:08       But what I'm interested in is like just coming to, you know, I've been here two years now, but I do get a feeling that that is a really quite um, kind of almost mainstream position. A lot of people feel like that in America. Maybe it's a California thing, I don't know. But then I'm interested why the libertarian movement in a, the political expression of that kind of attitude is the libertarian party that candidates, they, they don't seem to get anywhere. They don't seem to do well even though that kind of attitude feels to me like it's really very kind of true to the American approach to things and is shared by a lot of people. Like I kind of hear that a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:21:44       I think it's slowly but surely starting to gain momentum. But I think the Internet's influences barely, barely two decades in 1994 to 2014 right. That's, that's the realistic take on it. But the real impact as far as like social impact, I would, I would say it's probably a decade. 10 years is not that much time. And then in that decade how much of it has been concentrated on social change and how much of it's been concentrated on porn? You know, how much of it is concentrated? I look, we can see tits anytime you want now. Woo. And this new found freedom, this new found ability to access information, it's just, it's going to take a while before I think people are evolving right now. I really do socially, um, at a, at a rate that's just unheard of is never the kind of movements that you're seeing now whether you agree with them or not, whether it's Operation Wall Street or whether it's a, anytime there's a social change or social movement in this country, whether you agree with it or not, it's fascinating to step back and watch this swarm of activity that takes place because of any issue that comes up now that really couldn't, couldn't happen before without, you know, you'd have to have like a physical meeting you'd have to have, people would get and someone to have to have a megaphone and we'll we need to do is take back the streets.

Speaker 1:          01:23:10       Well we need to do is make the world safe for our children and we need to get out of Vietnam. Yeah. You know, and then you know, the cops come and break it up and hose everybody down and they would shut down the problem. We can't do that anymore. You can't shut down the problems because the problem exists on reddit. The problem exists on millions of people's Twitter accounts. They're posting things. There probably exists on Facebook. The problem exists anytime there's dissent that dissent sort of encapsulates an entire group of people that share these ideas and they can feel freely communicate. And I think they're just starting to realize that they can freely communicate the way they can and unfortunately a lot of them are annoying. Unfortunately, a lot of people that have fit figure this out or annoying and you see these really dumb ideas that spread like wildfire, wildfire and a bunch of idiots are behind it. And it's, that's fascinating to watch too. But I think ultimately when it all balances itself out, we're going to deal with a much more informed, much more educated, much more aware, much more socially conscious society than we have ever had in the past. I think a decade from now to deck, two decades from now, we're going to see the rewards of this. And I'm very optimistic. I like it

Speaker 5:          01:24:24       that, that way of thinking about it. And I, I agree and I guess what we w w the way we're thinking about it is that, that we want to kind of, now the next step really is to really take that energy and, and really direct it into the heart of the political system. Mm. Not kind of on the edges of it. We've kind of protests and, and, um, and sort of social movements, but really getting into the guts of the, of the, of the way laws are made and the way the country's run, the states who were on cities are, and, and, and kind of injecting it into the, into the real heart of power. I think that's gotta be the next step.

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       Yes. I, I agree. And I hope that it can be done. I mean, I wonder if the way technology is advancing and the way technological innovation seems to exponentially increase, if there's some way to manage things in a way that's sort of, um, not discovered yet or sort of hasn't been, no one's figured out a way to sort of organize this whole thing. In a way that's much clearer and now we're dealing, it's almost like code. Like do you remember what code used to look like when you used to use dos? And if you use an old computer yet an mtor, everything had command prompts. Yeah. But then someone came along like xerox figured out this graphic user interface. It just, Whoa, fuck all that. Just to see that thing. Just double. Just press twice when you want that to open up and boom, and then you'll see a graphic representation of what you want.

Speaker 1:          01:25:56       That's a much more simplistic element. You don't have to look at all the code behind what you're doing when you're using Microsoft word. Uh, cut all that shit out. Let's just see. Let's, let's make it real simple. And if we could get, get it to that in politics, like, okay, what would make, what would, what would we have to do to make more money go towards school and less money go towards war. Like is that, is that a way it, was there a way we could work that out? If you look at how much money is being spent in the Iraq war, how much money's being spent in Afghanistan, is there a way to take 30% of that and put it into our schools? Because my God, the school system would radically change our education system, would radically change the amount of people that would come out of these educational systems that were more balanced, more aware, had more nuanced perspectives, would radically change our country, would radically improve like over the course of a decade. If you could just figure out a way to put that kind of power in people's hands, what they choose to do.

Speaker 5:          01:27:05       Well, I think the way that you do that is, it goes back to what we were saying earlier is is actually literally doing it by, by getting rid of these kind of big organizations, central government organizations that try and run the whole system from some office somewhere that's completely removed from the, from the parents and the kids that was actually using the schools and and really give responsibility for this. The way the schools operate to local communities so that they can try things out. Because every kid is different. They learn in different ways and whatever nature it feels to me like when it comes to education, we've got this approach which is someone has decided, you know, this is the theory, this is how we're going to get kids to learn whatever it may be and we're going to try and have a kind of common application of that in every school and everyone's going to teach the same way and that's great.

Speaker 5:          01:27:57       And I just think that the evidence shows that is not right. It doesn't work for every kid and you want to have a system where you know you, you've got much more ability to experiment and try things out and adapt things to each, each, you know, different type of child and the way that they learn. And I think we need to see a lot more kind of smaller schools where they're much more kind of community run uphill. I sang with the gardening. I think sort of a community approach to these things is going to be the way to do it. You definitely need the money of course to sort of have high quality as well. So I agree with that. It's just that if you just put more money into the current system of organizing schools, I don't think you'll get the kind of benefit that you could if you actually gave the power of the system and took it away from the people at the center and put it in the hands of people locally that that's how I would do it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:47       And if they did that you could also see the results positive and negative and imitate the positive ones. You could see like these people have an approach and their approach is more sort of Waldorf school based and less electronics and wouldn't

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       toys and interacting with kids and look at the benefits like, man, all these people are coming out so creative. But then there's another place in San Francisco that's much more tech involved. Everybody has an iPad and all these kids. Well we'll leave it as a benefit there as well. I mean I think schools are a huge issue. The massive underfunding of education. This country is a huge, huge issue and it's, it's madness and it's almost like sort of ensuring that poverty and that this was going to be right. You know what I mean? Yeah. I done a lot of it is the kind of people that go into teaching, you know, you really, you'd want the best people, the smartest, best people going into teaching. It's like the most important job that get paid $20,000 a year. Right. And that is not going to get that if you'll pay those kinds of, you know, it's really kind of obvious.

Speaker 4:          01:29:47       We apply that in every other kind of area. You kind of know that if you pay more, you get something better generally. And I think that that is a huge part of it is actually if you, you know, trying to get the best people in the countries that have done really well. I think that Finland is a good example from what I know. I'm, you know, I spent quite a lot of time this when I was in the government. Finland is a, is a place where it is the cultural thing. If you know a really, um, admired an esteem thing to do and well rewarded is to go and be a teacher. It's like one of the best things you can do. And that's true. I think of a lot of the Scandinavian countries and they have better results as a know thanks to that.

Speaker 4:          01:30:24       So you've got to just get the best people to go into teaching. That's really important in this country. The prohibitive cost of higher education is shocking when you start thinking about how much money it costs to go to college, how much money it cost to get a degree, and you accumulate student loans that are almost insurmountable. How many people get out of college in this country? It's amazing that the figures are just unbelievable. They are so in debt, just stunningly in debt. Like I have a friend who is in his 50s and just paid off his, his, his uh, 50s. Yes. Wow. Just paid off from medical school. This isn't fucking insurmountable debt. Insurmountable debt forever. Yeah, just slowly but surely chipping away at hundreds of thousands of dollars in an educational debt. It's really amazing. I mean, one of the things I'm doing right now is teaching at Stanford a little bit and, um, and it's just, there's, there's a kind of good point, which is that it seems to me that the students are so much more, um, hardworking and motivated than the ones that will certainly than I was not seen diversity, but you know, it was all free when we did it in the UK and here it's not anymore, but it was when I was at college and here when they're paying so much for their parents are paying so much, they take it really seriously and that's great.

Speaker 4:          01:31:48       But the, the amounts of money involved, I just staggering. Really unbelievable. Especially when you get to law school or medical school or you know, any really expensive school. Stanford,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       you know, that's a very prestigious school. It's going to, cause it must be ridiculous. I mean, how much does the kid have to pay a year to go to,

Speaker 5:          01:32:06       cause they have a lot of, um, uh, they do, they do a lot of great work to kind of make it possible for kids without the money to go. So they do a lot of grants and scholarships and I don't know how that all works out. Well that's what it's it's, but it's a huge amount.

Speaker 1:          01:32:21       Yeah. That, that's nice. And it's beautiful to hear that they do something along those lines. And it's also beautiful to hear that, uh, I believe it was MIT has released all of us, it studies online. You can take all of its classes online for free, essentially get an MIT education through your home computer. Just very nice. It's very nice that, that, and you, if you think about the amount of access that people have to higher education today when it comes to online courses, when it comes to just papers that they could read and download documentaries, they can watch different things that they can read. It's, it's kind of incredible.

Speaker 5:          01:32:56       Yeah. And it's actually really powerful in not just thinking about America but um, and people in the, in the states who wouldn't have had that access, but actually all over the world, it's this, that, you know, in Africa where you, you're just able to bring, you know, instruction and the, you know, the, the best people in the world, the best teachers to the most remote village in Africa is completely staggering.

Speaker 1:          01:33:19       Yeah, it is. It is interesting. And I've always had a fascination with the, the power that someone has in the position of being a professor and especially professor with tenure where they have this, you know, kind of this job that essentially it's very difficult to get fired from. I mean, you have to really do something really fucked up. Yeah. To lose your position. And because of that, some of them, and I've had friends that have had these professors, some of them get these incredibly arrogant attitudes and they push their ideas as if their doctrine, right. And they push their own political ideas and their own ideology. Oftentimes a very left wing liberal agenda to the point where it just infuriates certain parents and infuriates people who disagree with these ideas, who gets silenced because you know, it's the professor's word and that is it. In my class, this is how I feel. It was not education. I mean the, you know, to me, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:34:19       The whole point is you should be equipping the students to think for themselves and to, and to kind of come to their own point of view, but give them the tools that they can do that with and, and, and go out and then use that knowledge and ability to do great things in the world. Not to kind of tell them your point of view. I mean, that's where you can tell them your point of view, but make clear that it is your point of view and there are other points of view and it's up to them to decide what they think.

Speaker 1:          01:34:43       Yeah. But that lack of, that humility is oftentimes lacking when you have a person that has absolutely.

Speaker 5:          01:34:49       That's right. There's no kind of accountability there because it's just, you know, they don't have to deliver any.

Speaker 1:          01:34:56       That is like one of the complaints right

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       about the amazing thing though. I loved the speech that um, uh, Mike Bloomberg gave the other, I think it was last week, did you see this? He went to Harvard and he gave a commencement commencement speech I think to Harvard where he really attacked him on this point and said that they had this kind of liberal bias in the, in the faculty there that was just really bad. And the, yeah. And he had this great piece of data, which was that if you look at, it's going back to campaign finance, if you look at the campaign finance records, because that, you know, everyone's donations, it reported and when you, when you make a political donation, you have to say what your occupation is so you, you, you know, it's quite easy to, to look at types of professions or whatever and where their money goes. And he got this piece of data, which was that if you look at the political donations of Ivy League faculty and staff, and you look at where the money went in the last election, the figure for how much went to Obama was 96%. So it was like this total liberal dominance and he said that is just not healthy. That is not what the university is supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          01:36:05       The problem is the alternative was far more offensive if they went to John Mccain and Sarah Palin did that 4% is the problem. Believe it or not, in this country. I mean, Obama's, I'm not a fan of what this administration has become, especially when it can turn when it can. Uh, it deals with freedom of the press when it deals with whistle blowers, when it deals with a spying on Americans, like all the revelation that we found out about the lack of privacy that people have. I'm not a fan of that at all, but God damn, having Sarah Palin as the vice president of the fucking United States would have been disastrous. Having a, an old man who's playing poker where they're talking about going to war with Syria, who's literally sitting on his phone playing poker, you know, I mean, what the fuck that was a president that, that was the vice president, those two dummies.

Speaker 1:          01:37:02       I mean, that's a disaster. That's a fucking God damn disaster. So of course the most educated amongst them went for the lesser of two evils. Being Obama, being a guy who was a very articulate, intelligent guy who's a whore. I mean, essentially that's what Obama is. He's what he is, is a guy who's very intelligent, articulate guy who had these ideas and promoted this ideology, got into office and did essentially exactly what Bush did. I mean, in worse when it comes to whistle blowers and stuff, yeah, yeah. And well, you know, all the things that we're going to do, we're going to close down Guantanamo Bay. We going to get out of Afghanistan. It turns out most of it was bullshit. Most of it. I mean, when you talk to people that are, that are journalists, this country has a horrible record and this administration has a horrible record on freedom of the press, a horrible record on punishing whistle.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       And it's, uh, the, the, the lack of, the lack of respect for, for journalism and freedom of the press is very disturbing to people because what, what is journalism truly well, what it truly is is you're exposing reality. What a true journalist is doing is exposing reality. When you punish people for doing that, when you punish people for blowing the whistle on what is essentially unconstitutional activities like the NSA spying on every single fucking person on the planet, I mean, that's unconstitutional. When you record everyone's phone call, that's not what we want. And when the government supports things like that, I mean, how, how is this the same guy that was like, hope and change? How, how is this the same guy? Well, he's the same guy because the people that fucking got him in the office, or the same people that got Bush in the office, the same goddamn influences and things like Crowdpac things that you're trying to do. What expose that for folks? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:38:52       the, I mean, that's the idea we're trying to be and you know, it's really important that we're, um, you know, it's, you know, we just going to nonpartisan. So while we've got a strong point of view about the system generally and how we can improve it, you know, we don't really, it's very important. Don't take sides. We don't have a point of view as a company about individual issues, but I think that we do really care about, um, changing the system. And I think that one of the, one of the things about the press that, that sort of happens, and I've seen this, I'm kind of both sides of it, is that there tends to be this kind of coziness that develops with a lot with a lot of the press, particularly the traditional press where, you know, they want to have access to the politicians and the politicians want to get their message out and it just gets quite kind of cozy. And so that whole role of investigation and exposing things, um, kind of sometimes takes a backseat to having a good relationship so that you can get your message out and that, and they get access. And I think that that's one of the things, again, that's really helpfully being changed by technology, like you were saying, which is that, um, you've got people who are able to get, you know, to, to do that job of investigation without having to be part of some cozy group around the politician. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:06       He's going to lob softballs and every politician, you see

Speaker 5:          01:40:10       it from the politician's point of view, their point of view, and it's, you know, there's a lot of truth to it is that they're trying to do stuff. It's really, really hard. You know, trying to deal with some of these problems is difficult. Um, there's incredible expectations. Um, you get chip for what, you know, just trying, um, you're totally under scrutiny. Your life is under scrutiny. It's a really, really hard job. And they feel that the increasingly the media and the press and are just interested in the trivial aspects of it and who's up and who's down and they're not really interested in kind of exposing the complexity of some of these issues, blah, blah. So that, that's how the politicians see it. And then on the other side, and that's why they end up trying to, you know, have a relationship that enables them to, in the, in there and the way they see it to, to explain what they're trying to do a bit better so that they, so people kind of give them a fair hearing.

Speaker 5:          01:41:02       So that's why that all happens. And you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of truth to that. To be honest. It is difficult what they're trying to do. Um, whatever, whatever your Liberal Democrat or conservative or does it makes no difference. It's difficult. Governing is difficult. It's complicated. The problems are complicated. Everyone's got their point of view, you're kind of being screamed at and yelled at the whole time and it's hard. Now look, they choose to go into it so we cannot feel sorry for them. You know, they make that choice. Like you said, they have that kind of, I'm going to be the leader and I'm going to go there and sort things out. So it's the choice that they made, but it is difficult and that's why they want to, you know, try and can't control the message I think because they feel that a lot of the time they don't get a fair hearing.

Speaker 1:          01:41:45       Well that makes sense in some ways, but it doesn't make sense from the point of view of the people that are in the position of being a journalist. If you're in the position of being a journalist. Fair enough. Yeah, you, you're, your whole position is to expose inequality, expose violations of the constitution. And when you are, you're in one of those places where you, whether it's for CNN or Fox News or whoever you're working for, if you get to sit down with Dick Cheney or you get to sit down with Obama, you're already muted. You're already neutered, you're already silenced. You don't get that chance to pro. They're never going to have Glenn Greenwald sit down with Obama and an open internet forum that airs in real time live. They would never agree to that. They would never agree.

Speaker 5:          01:42:35       Greta. This way, it actually, cause it's a really different tradition in England. When you look at the way that interview, if anyone watches a TV interview of a politician in England is so different to what you get here, they're really aggressive with them real and you really, really, really aggressive. And, and the kind of softball stuff is actually kind of embarrassing for a journalist to do that. And there's a different tradition.

Speaker 1:          01:42:57       Well, we used to have that. It's really true. I've really noticed that they shot a few people, Park some cars on railroad tracks with families in them, and then people kind of stopped doing that. Um, I think that guys like Glenn Greenwald who lives in Brazil and gets to sort of attack America from a distance, you know, at least until they find him. I, I think, uh, what guys like him are doing with, you know, he was the one who helped, uh, Edward Snowden release all of his documents and the, these, these new players in this whole game, these outsiders that don't have to cozy up don't have to be a part of this, uh, this nepotism that we're seeing with the big ones. I mean, any, anybody that's in any sort of a large group, Fox and CBS and NBC, you're a part of this wacky system.

Speaker 1:          01:43:48       You're a part of this system that's not going to expose these. It's going to let these people get their message out. Because if you don't, you're not going to get the big names. If you don't get the big names, you're not going to get the ratings. And then those big names, you can go to Fox, those big names are going to go over to CNN. They're going to go somewhere else and you're going to lose this, this, yeah, that's exactly how they, it seems to work here. That's what I've noticed. Yeah, it is. It is it. And I believe it's getting exposed and I believe it's getting exposed in a way today that just wasn't happening 20 years ago. 20 years ago. You would just be frustrated and you would just go off and you'd write a book and everybody go, Oh, he's another look at the fucking crazy book that guy wrote.

Speaker 1:          01:44:28       And you know, some people would read the book and say it was amazing, and other people would just ignore it and new revelations would take place along the way. And whatever had happened would be forgotten. And then the politician would get out of the office. And I think George Bush is the last guy to sort of skate away like that. And you know, now he sits around and paints weird pictures and slowly goes insane. Have you seen the things he's doing? He's slowly going insane. I mean he's, he's painting pictures and he's locked in this world of, he's essentially in a prison on a ranch. I mean, that's what he is. He's constantly circled by secret service agents. He's hated all over the world. He's at least indirectly responsible for over a million deaths. This one guy, they're pinning it on him and Dick Cheney and his administration and this sort of pyramid of events.

Speaker 1:          01:45:16       And this guy feels that shit and he's just sort of wandering around on his fucking ranch, painting himself, staring at himself in the bathroom mirror. I mean, it's really, really weird stuff and I think he's probably going to be the last guy that ever skates off into the sunset with this, this, this knowledge. I think Obama's going to be held accountable for a lot more than Bush ever was. And I think whoever's next is truly fucked, whether it's Jeb Bush or whether it's whatever, you know, new Democrat, they try to sneak into, I don't know, Hillary Clinton, I don't know what they're trying in 2016 and we won't know for a while because they have to vet out. Everyone's fucked up. Vices and skeletons in their closets. And in this day and age, it's almost, sometimes it's terrible. I think by the way. Cause that's what I, one of the reasons that so many people get put off from, you know, cause a lot of the complaints you hear about politics as well, we just get the same kind of people.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       They're all kind of, you know, very, um, kind of similar to each other. And there's a particular type of person that goes into it. And actually a lot of people who I think could make a really good contribution don't do it exactly for that reason. They just didn't want to live under that kind of spotlight and can't, that's just normal human beings. And they've got stuff that they had fun. Right. It's kind of fun in their life. I mean, people that have had fun, you know, I mean, you can't one gay affair when you're 20 years old with a guy for a couple of weeks and you're fucked for the rest of you. That guys out there waiting to talk shit about you. If you run for president, you know there's one time you did a little bit of heroin when you're on the row with a bunch of your buddies.

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       You know we were at, you're in college, you tried heroin. Oh, that's fucking college buddies. Ready to write a book about you doing heroin. I mean there's a, it's a weird time when it comes to exposing people's pasts and this idea of this perfect person from the cradle to the grave running for president is preposterous. You don't want that person, that person, if they've never made any mistakes, that means he never taken any chances if they haven't taken any chances they haven't lived. And I'm not talking about mistakes like victimizing people, horrible things that are completely unconscionable that you wouldn't do and I wouldn't do murder and robbery and kidnapping, all sorts of terrible things that are just massive, you know, ethical errors that just shouldn't be ever tolerated from a person's character. Just little things like here's a perfect example. There's a woman who's running for mayor right now in Mississippi and apparently when she was younger, she was a prostitute.

Speaker 1:          01:47:45       And it, this is a, it's a big story that, you know, folks are trying to figure out like what is, is that okay? Like how do we, how do we handle this? Like what do you do about a person who had made mistakes when they were younger? Like what is, what is the answer to this? And no one really knows. They don't really have the answer to that and trying to figure out like when, what is happening in the, in that is it, is it I'm playing against her or what's this for sure. She's in Mississippi and she revealed it herself. Um, she revealed that she was a former prostitute and she was a prostitute, like I believe it was 30 years ago. And she met her husband while he was a John and, uh, he was one of her clients and, uh, she married him and she hasn't been a prostitute since and now she's running for mayor.

Speaker 1:          01:48:36       And it's, it's a, it's, it's quite fascinating. I think it's interesting and I think in a lot of ways, um, you could see that and think this person is actually really well qualified to be an office because obviously, you know, going through those sorts of experiences, we'll give you a sense of empathy for, you know, the tough lives that some people have and this and the second sentence at the end up putting them in that situation and it probably makes you better not was, well not only that, what she did was totally legal as well. She was an illegal brothel in Nevada and it was over 30 years ago and she hasn't been there since. And the idea that this person is not allowed to make errors and that she wouldn't have developed like a lot of empathy and character and she wouldn't have to think that's right. Yeah. I'm a more balanced perspective than a person who's grown up in a very privileged household with very rich, wealthy, connected people. And then they got him to an Ivy League school and then he became a member of skull and crossbones and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Instead of that, well, you have person who's who was 14 and was pregnant with a child and had to take care her child and her parents

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       died. And she had, was forced into a situation where she had to earn a living and she didn't have a lot of options and this was one of her options that she chose. And how could you judge someone who's a teenager that makes those choices? I mean, I don't think he can. And I think this person, I mean good for her that she stepped up and talked about. I think it's great. And I again, it's kind of interesting that some types of early childhood adversity, a kind of okay for your political resume. Yeah. I came from a poor family and, but broken home. What about Bill Clinton? And it's okay, that kind of, um, difficulty is, is acceptable. But then there's this other category which is just as character four tracks and drugs and whatever. They're just his character forming potentially. But, uh, not acceptable. Yeah, the sacs ones, the wackiest one ever because it's totally legal.

Speaker 4:          01:50:43       Like save this woman had, you know, x amount of clients per month. If she just fucked a bunch of guys, you know, everybody would be like, Gosh, she was young, she was young, she was getting wacky, but fucking a bunch of guys for money is a problem. But if she just massaged guys, no problem. I mean, if she gave them pleasure by rubbing their bodies by rubbing your shoulders and backs, no one would have an issue with it. But by doing something to their penis, by the way, posture, it was one of the guys, one of the clients running for office and it was, you know, it's okay to be a client. That's fine. Sure that you know, something you'd be proud of. But if that was kind of exposed or whatever, that wouldn't be a barrier. Sure. Even 10 years ago, forgot about 30 years ago, 10 years ago, the guy went to a prostitute and said, listen, I was horny.

Speaker 4:          01:51:28       I didn't have any options. I had a few bucks. I paid someone to touch my penis. People would go, yeah, exactly. Totally sexist kind of way of thinking about this act. Should sex should be legal to sell. That's what I think. I absolutely 100% believe that prostitution should be legal. I wouldn't want my daughters to do it. I wouldn't want my friends to do it. I wouldn't want loved ones to do it, but I wouldn't want them to work at Wendy's either. I wouldn't want them to work on the the the people that you see on the highway picking up dirt or a picking up garbage by the side of the road. I wouldn't want them to be pouring asphalt in the hot summer. I wouldn't want anybody to work at difficult job. I think emotionally it's got to be incredibly difficult to have sex with someone that you don't want to have sex with, but I don't think it should be illegal.

Speaker 4:          01:52:12       It's legal to have sex with people. How the fuck could it be legal or illegal to pay to have sex with people or have someone pay you to have sex with you? It seems ridiculous. It seems just as ridiculous as making massage illegal. Yeah. I don't, I don't know. I honestly haven't thought about it enough. One of the things that, um, I definitely feel strongly about is that if we're going to make that kind of decision, the sex trade, the sex trafficking trade needs to be one of the ways you think about it because that is just so evil and disgusting, completely evil, completely disgusting. And

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       whatever decision you make has to make that better, not worse. And I don't know, I haven't really thought it through enough, but it's a very good point. That's a very good point. I think it would probably be far less demand for sex trafficking for illegal sex trafficking if prostitution was legal, if adults could make that decision. If some woman, you know, was in a situation which was like, you know, I'm reasonably sexually attractive and I make x amount of money per month doing this, I can make that same amount in a day having sex with people. Okay, I'll just do that. You know, if, if it's, if it's a woman's choice to do so, and some women would have no problem with that choice. The real problem of course is victimization is a real problem is exploiting young people. Victimization and objectifying women, but does not already take place and isn't part of what objectifying women.

Speaker 1:          01:53:37       That part of this issue is the, it's very difficult for some people to find sexual partners. So there's like this thing with this Elliot Elliot Rogers, this crazy kid that shot up everybody. Incentibox Santa Barbara. The, the, the nuttiest response that I've seen to this, the craziest, most infuriating response is by these people that believe that if women weren't so stuck up, this guy wouldn't have gone on a rampage because he would have been able to have sex with more people, but it would have been able to get people to have sex with them. Who's, that's pickup artists and the women, these women hating fuckheads there's, there's a bunch of guys that they're there, the operate under this, um, this guise of being for men's rights. And you know, it's Kinda funny cause I didn't even know there was like, there's a thing called an Mra. It's a men's rights advocate or activist and it's an insult from feminists.

Speaker 1:          01:54:34       I got called an Mra once and I was like, what the fuck does that mean? So I, I had a Google Mra men's right. And I thought it was ridiculous that, wow, how could you be a feminist but be making fun of someone who's into men's rights? Like shouldn't we all have rights? I mean it shouldn't, shouldn't there. But then I started looking into these men's rights guys and I go, Oh okay, I see what's going on. And yet they're more ridiculous. It's not the kind of radical feminists, new stuff. Like, cause there's, there's some campaigns that make some good points about [inaudible] child support. Yes. And they're off to divorce. I agree with that 100% but there's, they go way further than that and they go into relationships and they go into the way men are treated versus the way women are treated. People are treated in, in bad ways, by bad people and in good ways by good people.

Speaker 1:          01:55:28       But if you're a shithead, people are not going to like you. Right. And just because you're a shithead and people don't like you, it doesn't mean women are assholes. It means your undesirable. And one of the reasons why you probably undesirable is because you have a terrible attitude about things. And this terrible attitude about things is not going to change. You know, it's, it's not going to change because women have sex with you. Like your, your attitude sucks. You're not a pleasant person. There's a lot of people have shit personalities and they get involved in this. Men versus women did that has nothing to do with men versus women. What kind of things do they, I mean the mens rea, what does that, well, like Saint Cooling, is there a, you know, it wasn't so much nonsense. They're the, I don't even really want to get into it because some of it, some of it is so fucking stupid and I've been reading these things over the last couple of days and I'm trying to erase them from my memory because some of these poorly written articles by these men are so stunningly stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:56:19       Like one of them was, this guy was talking about how he was around this 60 year old man and this 25 year old woman who is his, uh, his incredibly hot wife. And that this 25 year old woman was insulting this man and you know that this is this, this is the anguish that this guy had a deal with and how horrible it is and this is what men have to deal with. And I was like, that might be one of the dumbest fucking arguments I've ever heard in my life. First of all, what if it was a 25 year old man in a 60 year old woman that was this old wretched creature that this guy was forced to fuck for money? Like would you be on the man's side of the woman's side then? Which, which position would you take there? Of course this woman is going to say shitty thinks this old man, she's not supposed to be fucking him.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       She's supposed to be having sex with a 25 year old man or a 35 year old man or someone reasonably close to her age where they would be naturally sexually attracted to each other. What you're dealing with is a bizarre situation where someone has sort of circumvented the system by acquiring money. Yeah, exactly. And by acquiring money. This guy's figured out a way to get some 20 year old hottie to marry him and yeah, she doesn't like it. So she could planes and um, I'm reading this and I'm like, does this guy who the fuck is this guy writing this article talking to who are his friends? Like why? How is that an argument? Yeah, that is nuts. I don't even want to pull the article up. I don't want to reference it. I don't want it to fair enough. But it's just what you're dealing with with these men is a bunch of nit picky shitheads with terrible personalities that are complaining about men getting a bad rap in this world.

Speaker 1:          01:57:58       If you do well in this life, you have an amazing chance as a man of, of being sexually successful, of having a great life of not being persecuting, of not being raped, of not being beat up by your spouse. I mean, the idea that men don't have the better end of the deal is unbelievably ridiculous. When you look at this, Donald Sterling guy is fucking shithead that owns the clippers. He's 82 his girlfriend was in her twenties and it this, this, this possibility only exists for men. It doesn't exist for women. There's very few 82 year old women who have attractive 20 year old boyfriends. It just doesn't exist. This is very, very few theory. You're on the watch. Watch what Madonna does. Um, oh, it's down the line. Do you know how, what, what kind of a monster? Like a lot of young men would feel like Madonna was if Madonna was trying to fuck them.

Speaker 1:          01:58:58       They're like, it's repulsive to men and an idea of a powerful, attractive man who's in his 50s dating a 20 year old woman is not alien at all. But the idea of a powerful woman, what does it Madonna in her sixties how old is she? I think she's 50s but I think that's what's really, to be honest, really cool about what she's doing. But that was just like, she's just really constantly challenging those kinds of stereotypes. Well, I think so by the way. She, I dunno. I think that she's suddenly, I think she's got a pretty intelligent point of view on some of these, these sort of agenda issues because she, she really, you know, I mean, and I think the fact that people find it uncomfortable, it's kind of making the point that we are drinking about, which is that this is not how it's supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          01:59:46       Yeah. Well she's, she doesn't even consider herself a feminist. She considers herself a humanist, which I agree with wholeheartedly. And this idea of a men's rights, what's really offensive about it is that, you know, they're concentrating entirely on the ideas and the problems that men face when I think the only ideas and promises problems that men face. The only ones are child custody and getting robbed in divorces. Other than that, shut the fuck up. Yeah. I really do believe that. I think those are the only two issues. Other than that, please shut the fuck up. Because when I hear about a guy who planning that a 20 year old wife is a, is mean to a 60 year old rich man, oh poor baby. This is what you do. Go Out and get more 20 year old wives', okay, you're fucking richest shit and you're old.

Speaker 1:          02:00:34       What are you gonna live forever, dummy. He'll go get some prostitutes. Go do it. It'd be nice to them. Give them cars. You know what to do with Donald Sterling did he got that girl like five Rolls Royce's and Bentley's and Ferrari's and shit and it still didn't work out that you know why it didn't work out. She didn't want to fuck him. They don't want to fuck you. You're 80 okay. That is just the law of the land. That's the way life works. This is the natural balance of nature and you know you, you've, you've figured out a way to inject influence and power and money and sort of pervert this whole system. Yeah. And when you complain about this perversion not working out in your favor, and this is why we need men's rights, he's go, Oh fucking Christ. You whiny bitches. You guys aren't men.

Speaker 1:          02:01:19       You guys are babies. I think it's just unbelievable that they're even talking to their babies. They're babies, and they're not recognizing the issues that women do have to deal with. Women have to deal with worrying about groups of men. Women have to deal with worrying about, if I walk into a parking lot, okay, and it's at night, and I see a woman in that parking lot, I'm not worried about that woman, but if I was a woman and I walked into a parking lot and I'm walking to my car and I see a man and that man's looking me in the eye, I have to wonder what kind of a man that is. I have to think about that. I have to think about that as a man. But as a woman, you really have to think about that. It's very rare that a man gets robbed by a woman in a parking lot.

Speaker 1:          02:01:58       Of course, it can happen, especially if the woman has a weapon. Of course, if you're in Russia, she might rape you. You know this, this is some stories about Russian women. You know, there's some story about she helps him, mankind captive and forced fed and Viagra and fuck them for 30 days. And that's the Russians. They're crazy. Some Russian chick might actually do that to you, but for the most part it's a nonissue or statistically speaking to a very, very, very small percentage of the population has to worry about this. For Women, the amount of women that get sexually assaulted, the amount of women, especially like in college, it's crazy. And colleges, you know, something like more than one on a 10 women get sexually assaulted in college. I don't know the exact numbers. I've read varying reports, but even 10% it's fucking really big problem.

Speaker 1:          02:02:42       I agree. It's a big problem if you're a woman because men are aggressive, we're aggressive, we're filled with testosterone and we need to come. It's a real problem every day or balls or building up more, more sperm. And if you're a shithead and if you were raised in properly and you don't have respect for women or the opposite sex or anyone in general other than yourself itself, yes, we have problems. We have problems with that. So, yeah, we need accountability as men, but it would also help if there was places where people could relieve themselves and it also help if there was a hand job place on every corner. I mean, God Damn Kona, why not? There's a massage place in every corner. You drive down the street in La. If you drive to go to Ventura Boulevard, drive down the street. If your back is bothering you, you can find a massage place.

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       One a mile, you'll see a neon light time massage, Swedish massage this beside you can go in and get your neck robbed. Why can't you get your, your balls rubbed? Why can't you? Why not? Because we're crazy because we have these weird ideas about sex. We have these weird ideas about what is evil and it's based on the puritan values of this country was founded on, which are founded by religious nuts who were were so cookie that they got in boats to escape persecution and traveled across the fucking ocean. I mean, that's the, the echoes of this ignorance is still propelling us today. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:04:01       I think the, I dunno, I think that with all that stuff, the thing, I've got a lot of sympathy for it, but I just keep coming back to this thing about, well, what is the, if you know, what does it, are you going to set up a situation where it's not really a choice that there's some kind of economic or other power that's, that's, that means that Oh, pressure. That means that, um, even though you kind of treat it like a marketplace where everyone's freely entering into it, is that really going with the case? I think that's the question. I just think you're totally right. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:04:32       And I'm not suggesting by the way, the prostitution is going to stop rape, you know, what I'm suggesting is that there are real issues with, with human sexuality and there's real issues with making things illegal that shouldn't be illegal. Whether it's drug use or whether it's sexuality. I think there's real issues in suppression. And I think when you suppress people from doing things, whether it's suppressing them from using marijuana, suppressing them from drinking, suppressing them from wearing certain clothes, suppressing women from driving, when you suppress human beings from things that are illogical, and I find it illogical that sex is illegal to sell. And I'm not saying I want to go to prostitutes. I don't, I don't, but I think they should be illegal. I really do. I think it's nonsense. I think we live in this weird world where if something is legal to do for free, how is it possible that it's illegal to do for money?

Speaker 1:          02:05:25       It doesn't make any sense. I see your point of view and I agree with it wholeheartedly that you do have to worry about people being sold into this. That you have to worry about them being somehow or another compromise by this, this overwhelming need for, you know, the, the financial revenue that can be generated from sex and that people could be exploited and that could it be a real issue with the objectification of women? It could change the cultural attitudes about things. But if you go to countries where it is legal, that prostitution, I was just going to say, I think in Hololens, right? Yeah, they, they find lower instances of aids, lower instances of like Jim Jefferies, he's a buddy of mine who's a standup comedian from Australia in Australia. Brothels are illegal. And he talks about how divorce rates are way lower in places where brothels or legal, because the men don't need to cheat on their wives.

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       Like some man just give up, they can't, they can't get sex with their wife. And he goes, fuck, I'm fucking Outta here. And they get divorced and they go through this huge stressful situation in Australia. You just go to a brothel, you know? And Jim was joking around about how his, his mom and his dad were fighting and his mom was like, yeah, and he goes to the brothel every night. I don't know if you know that or every Wednesday night. And he goes, oh, everyone's day. And that was, that was the punchline. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's whether or not people are being exploited, that becomes the problem. But that becomes a problem with everything. I mean, if people are being exploited into labor, if children are being forced to work in factories at, at young ages, which they are in other countries and typically other countries that provide us with these, these goods that we so want cell phones, laptops, all of these different, I mean how many children every year scraping minerals out of the mountains that they need to come to use to make electronics.

Speaker 1:          02:07:16       There's a lot of them. And this is expectation. This is exploitation that we benefit from. And I think that we have to address all forms of that. But we also have to address ridiculous laws that don't make any sense. And anytime you try to control people and any time you try to suppress ability to express themselves in any way, if you don't like it, you know, whether it's walking topless down the street, you can do it. If you're a man, you can't do it. If you're a woman. And that's what they're dealing with in New York City. Now in New York City, you're allowed to be topless as a one. Like the, um, there's some woman who calls herself the fucking naked cow girl and she's getting sued by the naked cowboy cause the naked cowboy is the guy who he wears underwear and he plays guitar with a cowboy hat on and he's like this sort of tourist attraction in New York.

Speaker 1:          02:08:03       Well women are allowed to be topless now as well in a lot of places because they like, the idea is well why is a man allowed to have no shirt on but a woman has to have, it's because you're saying that breasts are much more sexual than know when they're on a woman and that they need to be, they need to be covered. And that sort of develops a sort of inequality in the law that a woman is, you know, a woman is a oppressed or a woman is, I'm subject to law that a man is not. And that seems to be very difficult to pass. So you know, you deal with some situation where women are allowed to be topless and they should be. How many guys get arrested for being Juggalos? Is it zero? I mean, what was the last time a guy got arrested for fucking a woman because she paid them to, has it ever even happened. But women get arrested for prostitution all the God damn time, you know,

Speaker 5:          02:08:50       totally agree with that. I mean that is the rather than the people using them. Yeah. It's just totally, I agree with that. I think that when there's all I, you're right that there's so many kinds of weird things about sex and, and, and how that kind of plays out when you think about sort of social issues and stuff like that. And I think one of the biggest things that's going on is, um, the way that kind of that kind of the sort of sexualization of, of, you know, like public space and the w they'll kind of world around us is like really influencing more, more children. I think that they're kind of, it's getting younger and younger kids are being exposed to kind of sexualized stuff. Um, that is a real problem cause it's changing their expectation and what sex is. And there's lots of studies now showing how the, you know, like kids, sexual behavior is really different. You know, boys sort of viewing porn and violent porn at much earlier age thinking that that's how you behave, treating women really badly, women thinking of themselves as sexual objects more. I think there's a lot of kind of quite deep problems that are coming out and we'll see in the years ahead from the way that that is just, you know, like sexual images and content is just becoming much more widely available for younger kids.

Speaker 1:          02:10:02       That's a really good point because it's so prevalent and it's so uniquely new. The ability to download porn on his cell phone. So essentially if your child is 12 and they have an iPhone, you send them off to school, they're watching people, fuck yeah, I'm mean they're Gunna, that's fine. There's no way you're going to stop them if that phone has internet data, if it has internet access. So those kids are going to look at images if they have somehow or another summit, some access to an iPad or a laptop or something that's connected to Wifi. If it's not blocked through some sort of a complicated filter that they probably know how to dismantle than you do,

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       they're going to see sex. They're going to see sex in a way that we never saw sex. And I have this joke in my act that is a true story about when I was 11 years old, me and a couple of my friends found a magazine in the woods that was a foot fetish magazines. And uh, we, it took us like a few minutes to realize what was going on. We were looking at this magazine because it was really confusing. You thought it was like as a podiatry today or something? No, no, we thought it was a porn magazine for sure. Obviously that was the intent that, yeah. Okay. Well we, we were in the woods. All right. And um, I don't know if you've ever found pornographic magazines in the woods. Do you ever find them a hustler or in house? In the woods. In the woods, right? Yeah. And the puck in the look. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:11:24       But it's always like some poor bastard who's hiding his urges. It's a class, it's a rite of passage, you know, I think that it's very important everyone had that experience international. Yeah. Because for me it was in Florida and for you it was in England. It's amazing, right? The foot thing. That is exactly unexpected. So what the point was that we found these, this bag that had these magazines in it and we're going through this one magazine and it took us like many pages in to my, my friend goes, dude, this shit is all just dicks and feet. Like that's sad. And we were, and to this day I, I laugh thinking about my friend saying that and that we were stunned and confused. Well we were just looking at a magazine and we were 11, you know, today kids get to watch actual sex and apparently this sexual activity of children is changing.

Speaker 4:          02:12:17       Like someone did some study recently that showed this massive increase in anal sex amongst children under 18 years of age. It's really, I think it's a really big deal. I really do. And, and it's, and it's the sexual activities changing. It's the kind of relationship between, um, men and women, boys and girls, you know, that is changing. And the coal kind of, um, we talked about early in terms of, you know, women's rights and men's rights. And I think that that, you know, the expectations of how to behave, how to treat women and women's own sense or young women, their own sense of themselves as primarily being about that, you know, sexual, sexual persona. I think that's all really a concern. You know, it's actually setting back some of the kind of progress that's been made in terms of women women's equality. I agree. But I think hopefully at least, cause I'm, I'm the eternal optimist. I think it's temporary and I think that ultimately it's all gonna even out because I think that what people are doing is they're looking at these things like if, if, if women are engaging in these sexual activities, uh, at a much earlier age, they're looking at it, it's like this is something that they need to do

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       to become more attractive to men because this is what they've seen. They've seen this. My thought on all of this is that we're going to reach a point within our lifetimes probably within the next few decades where we're going to be able to read each other's minds. I think. I think it's inevitable, you know, over your house. Actually, it was the first time I ever tried Google glass, right? And we were putting this thing on and scanning it and you know, and googling things and looking at navigation screens in front of my eye thinking, man, Shit's going to get really fucking weird soon. I think we're going to be able to read each other's minds. I think this, this whole dance that we do, do you like me? Do I like you? You know who I'm going to play hard to get. I'm going to fucking do this.

Speaker 1:          02:14:15       I'm going to be the girl that takes it in the ass and all the boys going to like me. You know? I think all that nonsense, I think it's gonna. It's going to become far more complex, the human interactions because it's going to become far more complex because our concept of of secrets is going to go out the window. That's really interesting actually. I don't think there's going to exist anymore. I think if you look at the trend, what is the trend? The trend is that information is easier to access now than ever before and it becomes easier to access and easier to access and to the point where you can ask your phone questions with your voice, you press a button, you know who is Steve Hilton but it Steve Hilton is a ball ball, ball ball, ball ball and it gives you the information but that's just one step and it's not going to stop there.

Speaker 1:          02:14:58       It's not halting. It's exponentially increasing. So what is, what's the trend? The trend is dissolving boundaries between people and information. That information includes information in your own mind. That information includes, there's going to be a much more effective interface that looking at a screen and asking a screen of question, the interface is going to be somehow or another a neural implant, something that you inject into someone's body like nanobots. It's good. There's going to be some weird sort of an interface and when that happens they're going to come up with a better one a year later. It's going to be a more invasive one or more and then we're going to have to come to some sort of an agreement where we were going to say, hey, listen, in order for human, the human race to a established an enlightened perspective, we're all going to have to look into each other's heads and we're all going to have to be able to read each other's minds and find out how we think and feel and so there'll be no more mystery in this world.

Speaker 1:          02:15:49       There'd be no more romance novels, there'll be no more. There's no, there'll be unnecessary is not going to be any romance is going to be this weird hive mind thing going on and it's going to happen within a hundred years. And it's good. I think that's incredibly interesting and the, the way that that will change so many things. If, if people just say, you know, if that comes to pass and people can just know what the other person thinking, think about what it used to be like before language is established. People used to grunt and point and kind of try to figure out what the other person wanted. I mean, we're essentially monkey people. What did we do? We've, we've figured something out. We got to this point and now you compare your life today to that point. Like I

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       was in a conversation with a friend and um, we have another friend that is like a, he's becoming a prepper, you know, like a, he's fucking setting up his house for solar water and collecting rainwater or solar, uh, solar power and connecting, collecting rain water and growing his own fruits and vegetables and doing so in this fear that society was going to collapse. And my friend Jimmy was like, if society collapses, you don't want to live man. Like you don't want to be that one fucking God. It's got all the food and you're, you know, standing on your porch with a rifle and you're all taking turns waiting for the zombies to come over the hill. You know, sounding the horns and alerting the people that the barbarians have arrived. You don't want to do that and you don't want to go back to those days.

Speaker 4:          02:17:14       You just don't. And I think that we, we don't want to go back to the days of no language and we're not going to, going to want to go back to the days of, of secrets. We're not going to want to once, once the no secret thing happens and people just get this kind of understanding of what it is to be a human being. Nice. That it's universal. Yeah. It reminds me is that there's this, um, what going on at Stanford, they have a virtual reality lab and they're looking at how virtual reality could change the way people think about other people about other issues. You know, there's, there's one experiment that doing where I'll go pro, I'm just trying to get it right where they, I think they put you as like in a forest situation, you think you're in a forest and they, and then they measure some nature and some example of nature and then they see how they really give you a deep experience of that through virtual reality.

Speaker 4:          02:18:05       And then they look at your behavior in the next week after that to see if you're more conscious of that. You recycle more, you, you change your behavior because of this is completely false experience. You've had to give you this virtual reality experience and, and that's what they're researching and all sorts of other ways. And I think it's showing that it does and you can actually influence someone's behavior by giving them the sense of another world. Yeah. And that's again, just in its infancy. You know, the, the virtual reality stuff is just getting going and, um, and I just think it's interesting all these things, how they will affect so many aspects of how we relate to each other and think about these issues that the moment it just so kind of superficially dealt with, it's going to get really squirrely. Wouldn't that artificial realities indistinguishable from the reality that we're experiencing right now?

Speaker 4:          02:18:54       Cause that's coming to, you know, that's what the whole simulation theory is, uh, is, is based upon how this idea that one day we're going to get to a point where you can't tell whether or not we live in a computer or we live in the material carbon based flesh world. And if that's the case, how do we know that we haven't already gotten to that point. How do we know that we're not in a computer right now and we're thinking that we're experiencing this reality but it's not, it's not really happening. It's, we're just a part of a program and that it's so good that you

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       just, you can't, you think you really are Steve Hilton if you're not Steve Hilton. And he said, you know the truth Joe, he had set out, the thing is that when this kind of gets to a point where I just kind of, I can't handle it anymore. My brain cannot literally cope with, uh, thinking about some of this stuff. I remember a friend of mine repeatedly trying to explain to me like quantum physics and quantum things and I just literally can't understand it.

Speaker 1:          02:19:54       Yeah. The quantum stuff is hard, really hard. I have a,

Speaker 5:          02:19:57       I had this notion of, you know, alternate realities and things going on at the same time. I just can't get my head around it.

Speaker 1:          02:20:03       It's almost impossible to do. It's, it's really like when you start getting into quantum stuff, I don't even think they understand it. I mean they, they understand that in terms of these theoretical concepts, but it's so abstract and a lot of ways when you're dealing with things like when they start talking about subatomic particles and they started talking about the things that they actually do know, like the things that you actually can measure, you can observe. Yeah, like particles in super position, meaning they're in movement and still at the same time when they're talking about things blinking in and out of existence, they go away and they don't know where they went and then they come back with just that alone. The measurable stuff is so crazy that the lowest point, not the lowest, but the smallest measurable point of reality, which is this, these, these quantum ideas, the world's made of magic, things appear and disappear.

Speaker 1:          02:20:55       Things are still in their moving at the same time. They're here and they're there. They're in two different places at the same time and they can take particles and they can move them across the world and it, when they interact with each other, they interact with each other faster than you can count faster than you can measure. They interact with each other like instantaneously faster than the, in any kind of communication that we could have between these particles, given the amount of distances in between them, the speed of light, the speed of sound, they, they, they're instantaneously interacting with each other. Now they're figuring out a way how to send particles through time. They're figuring out ways to send particles through time to actually time travel with particles. And so all this stuff that they're doing right now is just one step on this never ending quest for technological innovation. There's never ending quest where people are trying to satisfy their curiosity. They're not going to stop. They're never gonna stop if we don't get hit by an asteroid if we don't get, I think that's right

Speaker 5:          02:21:56       then that's, you know, and you get all these good things coming from that. Yeah. Along the way. I mean, I don't understand it, but eventually it leads to things that we all can use and um, and deal with. A lot of those things are really good. I don't think that, I think one thing I would say about all this stuff is that generally speaking, we are not critical enough of the technological advances. I think that a lot of them are obviously in improvements. You know, if you think about just technology going back many years, you know, the way that, I don't know, like labor saving devices in the home completely sort of freed women from through the drudgery and the horrific kind of washing machine, all that stuff. That was just kind of such a terrible experience and that's all a fantastic sort of simple example of technology being really transformational in a positive way.

Speaker 5:          02:22:43       And I think generally that's probably true of technology. It's usually an improvement, but I do think that we have this kind of attitude of assuming it's good and just, and not really questioning it. Do we really want that? I think that doesn't happen enough often. The answer will be, yeah, we do. That's great. Fantastic. Bring it on. But I don't think we stop enough to ask the question. And I think that the scientists and the people doing this stuff, they don't really think about that. They just, they want to do it because they can. And it's as exactly as you said, it's this curiosity like let's just go further because that's a human instinct.

Speaker 1:          02:23:16       It's like when Oppenheimer built the nuclear bomb, I mean that should that really have been done? Well the, you know, the, the argument, the intelligent argument is if they didn't do it, the Nazis would have done it. So yes, it's important that the allied forces developed at first. But I think that that's the job of, I think there's all sorts of roles that are played in a society and there's the, the innovator and there's the scientists, there's the people that are constantly pushing the boundaries of technology. And then there's the, the social engineers who step back and go, okay, let's look at the repercussions of this and how do we mitigate the negative aspects of it? How do we figure out how to integrate these ideas into society and use them to enhance society and what is being done to sort of manage that. And what is being done to to minimize the negative impact.

Speaker 1:          02:24:05       Yeah, that is a good way of putting it that that different functions. There's just a constant, there's no one thing that's awesome. There's things that are awesome and then there's repercussions that are like, yeah, but then there's this, well there's that, but then there's this, this part of it that we're not really comfortable with and there's this sort of dance that we do as we build society and as society continues to grow and expand and our ability to do things changes our ability to access information, our ability to accomplish goals, our ability to transmit ideas is so much quicker and faster and there's these repercussions to that that were before this. This Day and age we're really unexplored because they weren't available, so we don't really know the long term repercussions of children being able to access porn because they really didn't have it. Yes, it's new. We've never done it. What that leads to weird world. Weird world. Steve Hilton, strange times. Is it good, good summary. That's why you tooth and claw resisted.

Speaker 5:          02:25:05       I done it, and this is definitely going back in there, but the, the way I agreed to it was like, if I'm away, I need a fund that they can get hold of me.

Speaker 1:          02:25:13       Yeah, that's it. That's it. And then you could shut it off occasionally, but to give it to very few people, you have to have a burner phone. Do you have to have a phone? Do you give to people that could possibly be annoying so that any given time it fell into the ocean, you'd be like, Eh, whatever. What that fucking phone, you know, and then have a phone that you only give to your family and your close friends. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:25:34       Well one of the things is that really puts me off. I just can't, there's something about my kind of useless to the fat, stubby fingers. I just hopelessness with touchscreens. That's all you can get. It's touchscreen. So when we were in Hawaii, you through your fucking Ipod at your computer and fucked up the screen, you were so frustrated. Steve got, uh, you know, I have a regular iPod with the click wheel. The wheel. I liked that. I liked that. I liked that. I liked that. But the, the new ones, the iPod touches, I don't, I don't find them as, they're not as easy to use. And I'm at the gym. I find them to be frustrating, you know, but you, you got ahold of one of those because you couldn't get your regular iPad. You got so mad he threw it at your fucking computer. That mark is, that reminds me of my tech. No rage every single day. But you're not a rageful guy, which is so crazy cause you're normally the last person I would expect to get violent and throw something and get crazy. But it was an iPod that did it to you. I know it was weird, but I do with technology as people who know me and work with me will testify. You've very Unabomber ask and that way. Oh Gosh. Okay. I better watch it. There's a, a,

Speaker 1:          02:26:46       a great documentary on the Unabomber and how he became who he is. I don't want to get into it cause I've talked about on the show before, but it's called the net and it's a, I think it's German. I forget what contributes available with subtitles. But basically he was a part of the LSD studies at Harvard. They cooked his brain. That's Ted Kaczynski. Ted Cause Yeah. Yeah. And he was turned in by his own brother, his own brother recognize the writing and the manifesto. And he realized that his brother had gone insane. It's like I think this is probably my brother that's doing this. Wow. Cause I wasn't here then, but that was a, so I don't have a sense of it being, I know that know what happened, but I don't get a sense of what a big deal it was. It was scary for a lot of people in America when that happened.

Speaker 1:          02:27:30       What was scary for a lot of people also because of who he was attacking, that he was attacking people that were technological innovators, whose attacking people that were involved in the distribution of technology. And he believed that and in a lot of ways correctly believed that there was something going on right now where people were creating technology and this technology would eventually do bad things to the human race and to the biological existence that we currently exist in. You know, this, this sort of like established way of being and living that we consider being, you know, inherent to being a human being. And he felt like these people were the enemies of humanity because they were fostering technology and creating items where they know that that was what was behind all that. He went too far ahead. He got wacky instead of living in the moment and dealing with the moment.

Speaker 1:          02:28:19       He just saw this, this attack by the biological humans or on the biological humans by technology, which essentially I kind of see his point in a way. I don't see his point as far as like attacking people that are creating technology, but if you really extrapolate where we are right now and where we're going, this symbiotic relationship that we have with technology where people are afraid to leave their phones behind the phones will eventually become Google glass. Google glass would become an implant. An implant will become, well, you know Steve, he's got good news and bad news. The good news is you have a year to live. Okay? The, the bad news is you have cancer. The good news is we have an artificial body that we have created that we're going to put your body into. The bad news is it lasts forever. So we're going to take, or is it the good news?

Speaker 1:          02:29:12       You know, this is what it is, is a new world that we're living in where we're going to have weird choices that never existed before and a lot of the people that are involved in Google, they hired Kurzweil, Ray Kurzweil, who is the proponent, the number one proponent of this sort of trends in dental moment where we become one with computers where we become one either with some sort of a computer interface or we download our consciousness and do an artificial body or we figure out a way to exist in some sort of a virtual reality that is eternal and there's, that's a lot of people feel like that's where things are going to go. Give us the science fiction

Speaker 5:          02:29:57       really not fixed. You know, it's definitely happening. Yeah. The one I talked to a friend of mine about this quite a bit, which is if you think about, I'm just interested that there, I got the unit on it. That's an extreme example and I wasn't, I didn't realize that it was so focused on technology, but there isn't really a, people like it. Generally speaking, there isn't really a movement that's sort of anti technology movement that not, certainly not that I'm aware of. If you think back to, you know, the, um, I can remember exactly when it was, but when you had this sort of industrial revolution and the Luddites, you know, smashing up machines that were, you know, taking jobs away from people and then their view really kind of damaging society. There's, that was a, it's got quite a big movement. Okay. Didn't get anywhere. And then history sort of made them irrelevant, but there was a movement with their name and an organization that did stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:30:48       What did they, what was there? There are,

Speaker 5:          02:30:51       I think there's specifically, it was the, the new equipment, like the weaving, you know, during the industrial revolution in England and the machines that were now being used to do the work that had been done by people and they, they objected to that. Not Incredible. And they would literally physically smash up the machines. That was, I think one of the things they did. And I'm sure there's people with a better study of history that can give you a better picture, but that was, they'll call the Luddites, I think named after the person that set the ma,

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       someone called Lud, I think. Um, uh, and I don't know how big it was, but it isn't as big enough that it's something we still know about and it's part of the history of that, of that era. And there's nothing like that now. Not, not to my knowledge where you, you don't have people going out and smashing up cell phone towers. No. Make a point about technology. Well, I think it's what we were saying. Other people like it, you know, it's kind of helps them in their lives and they like it for the most part. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of benefits. There's a lot of benefits to technology, but I think it's what we were talking about earlier, that maybe back then they didn't have enough information to draw upon and they saw it as being this direct threat to their livelihood. And I think that was a big part of it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:07       And I think today we're, we're, we're sort of forced into this realization that it's neither good nor bad, but rather something that needs to be managed and there's good aspects to it and then there's negative aspects to it and ultimately you have to figure out what outweighs what and how to lean it towards the positive and how to manage it in a way that it goes towards the positive. And I think that's the case when we were talking about with children watching television, you know, I know there's the Waldorf School, um, my oldest daughter was in the Waldorf school system for awhile and it's a lot of wackiness to that. Like they didn't believe in any technology. They didn't believe in, in the video games. But is it had been, they've proven that video games can enhance cognitive function. Then the neural pathways that are created by stimulating video games can actually there they mimic the games like chess, you know, like it was problem solving games, games that stimulate the imagination and creativity like they exist.

Speaker 1:          02:33:03       Video Games can be used in that same function. This idea that all video games are bad. And then I found out that the guy who founded this whole Waldorf system was that Cham Miller. He was a channeler like I, I'm getting a voice. There's a spirit who's talking to me about like, Oh, you fuck head guide to, is that our oldest son? You know, you know, he's in, um, uh, the same system. Yeah. That system has created by Kooks. Unfortunately, it's wonderful system and a lot of ways the school that my kid was at, it was great, but the reality is that it's founded by fuckheads, you know, founded by Christ. People that I'm definitely gonna look into that. Chandler. Yeah, we'll, we'll talk, I'll tell you the whole deal when we get off the air. I'll tell ya the conversations that I had with these fucking people where I'm like, what, what, what, what would channeler it's, you know, there's a lot of evidence that there's Chandler's no, there's not actually, there's none.

Speaker 1:          02:33:59       There's zero evidence that anybody's ever been fucking channeler. You know, I have a friend who he loves to believe in stupid shit and uh, he just, he's not a good critical thinker. He's a great guy, but he's not a good critical thinker. He's the first one that comes to me with a fucking ghost story, you know? And he came to me with this psychic thing which says, God knew all about my grandmother, man. The guy was real, the guy's legit. I go, do you know about your grandmother? He goes, yeah, I go. So the guy told you some shit you already knew what kind of fucking uses that. You're just talking to some guy who's, you're playing games. You played the trivia game, playing a trivia game about things you already know about your own family. This is a ridiculous, like what kind of a question did he ask you?

Speaker 1:          02:34:38       Like, Hey, leading questions that you answered in some way that he was able to concoct the story of your life. And people want to find that these things are correct. They want to find that someone is, but there's almost no evidence whatsoever that anybody has a functional psychic energy and method that is reproducible. And it doesn't mean that I don't believe in the potential for psychic psychic powers. Cause I think there's some weird connection with human beings. It's probably emerging much like a lot of our senses emerge. I think there's, there's weird senses that are emerging with human beings. Like for instance, they've statistically shown in, in a, in a way that's measurable that people can tell when people are looking at the back of their head. Yeah. You could tell in someone's looking at someone's looking behind you at you that the people could sense it in a way that is more measurable than chance.

Speaker 1:          02:35:31       So I think there's probably something there. This is probably something when you think about someone in, they call you and then it happens, let's, I've, I've thought about people and all of sudden I get an email from them out of the blue. I haven't talked to them a years and all of a sudden I'd be a person that was, that popped into my mind. Like, wow, I wonder what that guy's up to. Boom. We get an email from, hey man, what's up? Like, wow, what is that? Is that a weird sort of a distant connection that will eventually one day be much more strong? I Dunno. I Dunno. But I know that a fucking channeler starting a school that tells you not to use cell phones and don't watch TV. That guy's a silly pitch. This is ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense. You know, I think, I think you're right.

Speaker 1:          02:36:14       The anything that's really extreme is it's just not going to be right. I think. And they, and so we definitely don't implement the extreme version. Of course they recommend that's not quite right with all things. Even with reading, you can't read all day, every day, go outside, go for a walk, go ride a bike, go do something, get out. You got to get out. You've got to move. You've got to, and I think that that's the case with all human experiences. I mean if you're a person who was a, there was a thing recently that they, um, they, the uh, thing that they did about sex and about porn and that people who watch porn, they, they actually have less brain matter. They have less matter in their brain. People that are obsessed with porn and you know, when you think about it, it's probably because the, whatever they're doing, whatever part of their brain they're stimulating, they're constantly focused on that and all the other shit about wondering about existential questions.

Speaker 1:          02:37:15       The, the, the, the purpose of man, the, the, the idea of infinity, all these weird questions that normally bounce around inside a person's brain, they're completely nonexistent because you're just trying to find the next person at jerk off to your, just put you back at that guy the other week that came out in the government, which gives, you see, he was in the environmental protection agency I think, and he was watching, he was, he was, he lost his job. He's watching porn like I think six hours a day or in the office in the government is going on that that's even possible. Well, people are listening to this podcast in their office, guaranteed. They shouldn't be. It should be working. If it's six hours a day watching porn, maybe they should be. That's like, you know, yeah, it's ridiculous. But they're EPA, EPA employee downloaded 7,000 files of porn at work and watched him two to six hours a day.

Speaker 1:          02:38:11       Well, I don't think that guy was doing a good job of protecting the environment. I'll say I'd fucking freak. I'm not surprised if you give people the freedom to move around like that. That's what they wind up doing. People are nuts, man. He give people the freedom to just do whatever the fuck they want. You know? A lot of times they do things they're just trying to smart. Yes. That's just the way human beings are. Especially if you give them, it's like we were talking about as far as professors or police officers or anybody in some sort of an ultimate position where they don't have enough supervision, they don't have enough. Just they have too much influence over others and they don't have enough oversight. We wind up being this fucking guy. I supposed to be paying attention to our drinking water and just beaten off all day.

Speaker 1:          02:39:00       You know? And then there's also a job thing too. It's like how many, how many jobs you really should there be for the environmental protection protection agency and how many people do they really need to do those jobs if this guy can. But that's exactly what is he doing there? Well we know what he's doing there. What's the, if this guy can speak to, if this guy can work in the EPA and he could still like hold down that job and he's beaten off six hours a day and this was for years. It wasn't like just he went nuts and just one week for whatever reason went for it. It was like for years, I wonder how many people are listening to this podcast right now that are like, fuck, that's me. I want to get busted. If you're in an office and like, especially if your computer is facing like you and you're looking at the door so you get a clean shot at anybody walking in, you know for men, men are freaks. You give a guy the opportunity to just beat off in his office. A lot of times dudes are going to take it up, you know, environmental protection agency, Jesus Christ. What a weird world we live in. Where that's an issue. You imagine if like, it was back in the day where a, you know, a guy who was assigned to work for city water department in the 1930s they found 7,000 pornography books in his office. I'm like, frank, what the fuck are you doing man? Like getting crazy with all this reading.

Speaker 1:          02:40:25       I think in a lot of ways what we're dealing with when it comes to pornography, when it becomes to the Internet, when it, when it comes to just technology itself, is we're, we're dealing with these things that have influence over people in a way that were not designed to process. You know, we're not designed to process movies. A giant screen where explosions and space ships and all the stuff that's not real, but we're seeing it in a way that's much more impactful than real life. We're seeing it right in front of us. Yeah. You know, I think that that, that fucks with people's heads. You know, I think that pornography, the ability to at any time you want just go online and watch people have sex, like the, you know, that you could do that and it's at your little fingertips. Especially if you're like sexually starved.

Speaker 1:          02:41:14       You know, if you're like you really want sex and you can't get it and you know, I could watch it right now. I'm going to watch sex real quick. Oh, margin sucks. That's a weird thing with human beings. So weird thing that we've sort of painted ourselves into this corner. We have all this technology as we're talking about before. It's like we have access to it and it's all, it's about managing. It really did. This next thing is also, you know, reminds us that we're just animals really because you've got, I remember, you know, really struck my kids love nature programs. You Watch these nature programs and basically that are about sex and eating. That's what happens. That's what happens in nature. That's what will this out. That's the majority of the scenes that you see. Yeah, that is what it is. And so we just, um, and that sense animals, well, we certainly are.

Speaker 1:          02:42:04       And that makes the same. It's, it's, it's, it's not, I don't think we should be surprised that it's such a dominant part of, of life. No, no. We definitely shouldn't be surprised. But we're also much more complex than the average animal. That's where things get really weird. Where things get really weird is that yes, we are animals, but we are also animals with computers. We're also animals that are aware that we're animals. So we have to think about our actions. We're self aware, we're aware of the influence that others have on us, and we're constantly expanding that influence. You know, so we're not just animals, we're animals with computers that may become part of machines. That's the thing that freaks me out the most. It's a symbiotic connection that human beings have. The technology and the potential for developing artificial technology or artificial life. I think that we, we give birth to that.

Speaker 1:          02:42:53       I mean, Marshall Mcluhan once said that human beings are the sex organs and the machine world. And I always wonder if we're not some strange caterpillar that becomes a butterfly that has no idea what the fuck it's doing, and we're making some sort of a technological cocoon thinking that we're just doing my thing running around and looking at porn. No, you know, you're a part of this gigantic machine that's processing and pushing for the innovation of technology and the innovation of technology will eventually give birth to a life form. They're constantly working on trying to map out the human mind, duplicate the functions of the human bought mine. It's some sort of a synthetic process and we're not anywhere close right now, but the way technology itself. Exactly. Yeah. It's, it's, it feels unlikely that that's not going to happen. Yeah. I heard this, I read this article by this really grumpy fuck who's an interesting guy.

Speaker 1:          02:43:47       He's a smart guy, but he's also just a probably a lonely shithead and he was mocking Ray Kurtzweil how ray Kurzweil knows nothing about the human mind and he was talking about the complicated functions of the human mind and the way the human mind processes proteins and that this is barely understood, but what I read from this and what I got out of this, it's like I don't think this guy understands that it's the biological functions are not going to matter if they can be, if these biological functions can be completely irrelevant because they've figured out some sort of an artificial way to duplicate all of the exact same synapse firing mechanisms like without all the biological functions of the processing of the proteins, the interacting with the hormones and human neurotransmitter's. All that stuff is great if you're using a body, but this guy was so hung up on the fact that Kurzweil's wrong because we don't understand how the human body works, but no, no, he's not because he's just, you're just talking about bodies.

Speaker 1:          02:44:48       Yeah, bodies are super complicated. We haven't totally figured it out yet, but we might not have to. If we could figure out a way to do all the things that the body does, but do it with a computer or do with technology or do with some sort of quantum computer, some sort of quantum computer that's contained in an artificial body that can completely replicate the functions of consciousness, the functions of, of, of emotions, of interaction, of curiosity, of creativity. If you can develop an artificial computer that's creative, you're not, it doesn't matter what Luton Ising hormones and all this shit that you're bitching about. Your just bitching because you're showing your intelligence, you're trying to show people how smart yard, like criticizing a known genius cause you're not a known genius. I mean that's essentially what you're doing. Yeah. And it seems to just super efficient.

Speaker 1:          02:45:32       I know nothing about it, but the, the, the, the body parts of it feels like they, you know, there's a ton of progress, right, that they sort of volume mechanics and robotics is that that is easy compared to the brain. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. It is the what's what they do know about the mind and they do know about the body is comparatively rudimentary. When you think about what we know about a clock, we know everything about a clock. You know, you could buy a switch wa a Swiss swatch and there's a man out there that knows every single function of that watch, knows how it interacts, knows exactly what's going on. Tick Tock, tick tock. We don't know that about the body yet. You're right. You're correct. But we're not going to have to, we're not going to have to because they're going to come out with some shit that's way better than a body.

Speaker 1:          02:46:16       They're going to come out with some shit that's way stronger than a mind and it's going to be artificial and one day it's going to go hello and you're going to go, oh shit. And why exactly are you guys living like this? And you're like, oh, well, I don't know. Just kind of going on momentum. We just, how we do it. I don't think this is the best way to go about this. I don't think so either. I have a better idea. Oh Great. And then this fucking thing is gonna take over and then we're going to have real problems and he's going to really reform our campaign. Finance laws are going to have any voting and read each other's minds. It's not going to be any voting. We're going to know what's important and what's not. There was a guy once, and I've brought this up before, but it's important to know, there was a guy that we talked about in the podcast who had been bitten by a shark and the shark had taken his arm and taking his leg and he had this carbon arm and he was moving his fingers around him and he was standing there talking with this fake arm is fake leg about how great it is.

Speaker 1:          02:47:10       A technology is provided him with a way to still be moot, mobile and functional even though he'd been attacked by a shark. And I was sitting there and I was thinking, wow, this is fascinating. This guy's like kind of a Cyborg. Um, what we see as a man with an artificial arm. And the story was about how well they had created this arm to the point where this guy was living a totally normal life and you know, was functional and mobile and can take care of himself even though his arm had been bitten off by a monster. And then I thought about, well, what if it was both legs? Okay? And then they figured out our official legs, who would say no to that? Nobody give him some artificial legs. Now you can move around. Okay, what if it was his whole body would say, listen man, we're going to take your head.

Speaker 1:          02:47:50       We're going to stick it on a robot bought it, but you're still going to be you. Oh, okay. All right, I'll take it. Okay, we're sticking your head on a robot body, but listen, we got a problem. The robot body's rejecting your brain, but we found an artificial brain that works just like your brain. We're going to download your consciousness to this artificial brain. You won't even know the difference. Okay, well then who are you and what are you? What are you? Are you a person still? If you are your thoughts and your personality and your memories downloaded into some creation, some sort of a new thing that they've done that mimics all the functions of the human mind without any of the biological limitations. What are you,

Speaker 5:          02:48:34       yeah, I remembered that. It's so funny you talking about that because it reminds me years ago when I was doing my interviews to, to go to Oxford University and they'll have an interview with the philosophy professor and he gave me this scenario, which I now know is a famous philosophical thing. It's called the experience machine. And this, this, this construct very much like what you're talking about, which is like if we could put you in a machine that gave you all the experiences of a fantastic life, but it would be a machine doing it, would you choose to do it? And I remember saying, um, no, that's, I wouldn't want to do that because I'd feel want to have really done it myself. And if you're just in an machine that's not the same thing. Oh, but what if the machine made you feel like that you've had and you've been on an egg or whatever?

Speaker 5:          02:49:15       I said there was some kind of comeback and in the end I just remember getting really frustrated. So I don't know. That's why I want to come and learn about philosophy so I can figure this stuff out. But I have no idea. I kind of lost my temper. I never did figure it out. They just throw your phone out the way before the phone era. But it was just, it, there comes a point when I just find it really hard to, to um, to as or even go very far with this and I just think, oh well whatever, let's just sort of get on with practical life today.

Speaker 1:          02:49:43       Well it's essentially, it's the Dunbar's number of philosophical discussion. Our minds are limited in our ability to sort of take these ideas in there. We don't have the capacity to, to, to extrapolate. It's, it's too much. So this, this concept of recreating reality in an indistinguishable manner. It's too weird. It's too, but I think it's something we better start talking about cause it's common.

Speaker 5:          02:50:10       Yeah. And I, I w you know, I'm really happy that you are and I think it's really important that other people are, I'm just saying I'm not, it's way more important than other people are doing it than me in the hierarchy. You know a lot more about it than I do. And you've read more about it than I have. And um, I just think, yeah, it's really important that, that generally we talk about it and keep, you know, a really strong sense of awareness of how these things might change stuff. And a lot of the time it will be for the better and that's great. But we should just talk about it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:41       Well I had the opportunity to talk to Kurzweil for an hour and a half and I sat down and interviewed him about these things and it was really fascinating and we had a great conversation. But this guy is not thinking about negatives at all. All He's thinking of is Gung Ho, right? Full blast pedal to the metal. He mean he's taking like he takes giant bags of supplements every day cause he's an older man. He's just trying to keep his biology alive long enough to see this, this new birth of technology and when it gets really crazy. What he's trying to do also is he's trying to make his father come back to life. His father died when he was young and he believes that if they figure out a way to recreate a person from memories, from just the, the knowledge of who this person was, images that you're going to be able to recreate this guy and some sort of an artificial form.

Speaker 1:          02:51:40       I mean it's one of the things he's discussed this, this, he wants to see his father again and the idea that he can recreate as father technologically from men, from all sorts of different things, from memory, from all the, the data that you knows from recorded stuff in. One of the most fascinating concepts that that I've ever heard when it comes to the Incruse increasing power of computing is that they're going to get to a 0.1 day. If computers continue to accelerate, they're going to get to a 0.1 day where they can take into account all the positions of all the objects and all the things that are, that exist all over the world as data and from them extrapolate where things will be and where things were so by where things were, meaning, knowing everything in this room where it's at in this position, they'll be able to figure out how it all got here, who moved.

Speaker 1:          02:52:37       Jamie moved this over there and Brian picked that up and turn it on and they'll, they'll literally be able to calculate the past. There'll be able to buy what we have here by everything we have here and what we know. There'll be able to calculate the actions of the past madness. We're running out of time. That's what, yeah, he's holding his hand up. Okay. Well on the computer they hit grade cause at this point I'm just like, okay, that's madness. It is. I don't understand it. They'll be able to look at it. The ground itself, look at the, the content of the dirt, the, the pollution in the ocean. The carbon in the air, the distance between these two trees and the amount of pencils that are on your desk and they'll be able to figure out the past because computers will be so far advanced.

Speaker 1:          02:53:23       It just reminds me of that line. I can remember which woody Allen film where someone's said, how does he, how he lost his parents. How does the TV work? I don't, what do I know about the don't have the TV was, I can't even figure out how the can up and it works. Yeah. I just think like, you know the TV baffles me that stuff, you know? Yeah. Well it should. It should. And it's, it's only gonna get more and more baffling. We're stuck with these dumb monkey brains. Yes. That's the problem where the, the dumb monkeys that are sitting around here waiting for things to change and when things do change, we will be just as weird as some Australia pithiness. If you put them in a time machine from a million years ago and threw him into the fucking Burbank Mall, this thing would be running around going, what the fuck guys?

Speaker 1:          02:54:09       And this because things change because things grow and things evolve, including humans. We're just along for the ride. So I think the real key to human beings, and it's the most difficult aspect of life, is to get really good at this moment. Get really good at just existing in the moment and enjoying with that. It's fucking hard to do. Right? Yup. It's great. It's a great way of thinking about it because it just means that, um, you don't worry so much because you can, you know, there's stuff that you can understand and relate to and, and be, be good at and enjoy. I think that's totally right and there's some power and worry can't, you can't worry about worrying cause worry causes, preparation. Preparation causes you to cover your bases and remove a lot of paranoia because you relax. Like one of the best things you could ever do if you're worried about something as handle it, you know, you handle it, you deal with it, you don't have to worry about it anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:55:05       So I don't think there's anything wrong with worrying a little bit, but I think it's like all these other things that we've discussed. It's a balancing act. There's, there's, uh, there's, uh, don't go crazy and watch porn all day, but if you watch a little bit, I think you're going to be okay. You know, don't, don't get nutty and sit in front of the TV 24 hours a day, but watched game of Thrones every now and then, I don't think it's going to hurt you. You know what, dude? You get outside every now and then, but don't stay there when it gets cold. You need to get indoors. You know, there's the world's big, it's a lot of shit going on and it's simply a matter of there's so much happening and there's so much to take in and there's so much going on that there, there is not one good or bad.

Speaker 1:          02:55:44       There's just a bunch of different things happening all at once. Yeah. And that's why I totally agree with you that the more you can give people the freedom to experience and enjoy and it's kind of, you know, write their own story about how they, how they do stuff and not be told what to do by others, the better. Indeed. CROWDPAC there you go. Crowd pac.com. That is the website if a, if you're interested in that and the elections are today and shockingly little discussion both online and on the news about them. Um, but if your a, if you're curious, go to Crowdpac c r o d e p a c.com and uh, and get your voting guide. Get go there and click on it and entering all the information and find out what's going on. It's really, I, I, I did check this out. I think it's really pretty cool what you've done, clinical priorities.

Speaker 1:          02:56:39       It's, you know, it's really early days. This is the first little test version of it. We just doing it for California. So I'm sorry if people are listening outside California, we won't work so well for you. I should say that this is a test, but we'll be back for the midterm elections in the fall with them with a whole new set of things and data for politicians will have the country. Um, so September we'll be back with a much more, uh, developed and a much sort of bigger and better product and I think it's going to really shake things up a bit. That's the plan anyway. I think it will too. I think it will too. And we need to get you together with the young Turks. Yeah, I've got some great, I had checked that out after you mentioned the wolf pack thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:57:18       He's on the right track when it comes to that stuff too. Steve. Thank you very much. But a lot of fun. That was three hours, three hours, three hours.

That's the next podcast. Until then, go fuck yourself. No, don't do that. Be Nice. Be Nice to each other. Live in the moment. My friends enjoy it. Much love big kiss.

Speaker 6:          02:58:24       Hm

Speaker 7:          02:58:26       hmm.
