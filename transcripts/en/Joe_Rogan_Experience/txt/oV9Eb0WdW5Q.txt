Speaker 2:          00:04:46       the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 3:          00:04:49       Hey, Joe Rogan podcast by night.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       So the young man and targets you right now filled dimmers. Um, he, I heard about you on Twitter, on the Internet. People were contacting me about your, uh, your situation where you, um, you're an animal trainer, right?

Speaker 4:          00:05:10       I Wa I was an animal or an animal trainer. Why don't you tell us your story, tell us what, what got you to this point of controversy or that could take a while. Like how, where do you want to delve wherever it's interesting shit. Uh, well off the hop, let's just talk about how I became an animal trainer. Okay. I'm 22 years old, actually went to school for a broadcast engineering. Um, you know, I want, I had aspirations of recording bands and touring with bands, whatever it be, uh, as any confused 22 year old punk boy would be. And then sure as Shit one day at my dad and I were cruising around and he's given me the old, you got to get a job son. I'm like, Shit, because I paid a lot of money from education, which ultimately became a free download about six months later.

Speaker 4:          00:05:56       Like we're talking 2000, right. So and uh, saw an article in the paper you want to be a marine mammal trainers assistant. And I thought that's, that sounds like a great job. I can scrub buckets or do whatever it is to the people who are training these animals, but I didn't think I could get the job. Um, applied for the Gig and uh, you know, what size boots do you wear? Boom nine got this job. And I wasn't, you know, getting that marine mammals, trainers, assistant job wasn't, you know, you're going to go scrub buckets, everything. I mean there were obviously that it encompassed all of that, but I sort of training animals really quickly. Like right off the hop, right off the hop. They're teaching you how to do it and they're teaching her how to do it. You know. Now is there a science to train these things or is there, there's, they're like, like nice methods or more cruel methods.

Speaker 4:          00:06:49       Cause I've heard of some of the masses that you use to train orchids as kind of disturbing, you know, they lock them in pens together and get them really tightly grouped up where they can't do anything and they don't feed them unless they do their tricks. Yeah. That that exists in just about every application of animal training, but that's not the perspective that you exercise or that they train you when they train you to train animals. It's about positive reinforcement. So if an animal does something that's a desired behavior for instance, you reward them for that in that there's the subtle nuances of if they're not doing what it is you're asking, you don't reward them. So that's where, that's where the, you know, the, and then there's negative punishment. I mean there, there is all of that, all of that existed in training historically.

Speaker 4:          00:07:33       But trainers now and the art of training of training animals, it's more positive reinforcement based. So you learn all of that off the hop. But at the end of the day there's one, there's one variable and that's fish. So it's either reinforcement or ultimately deprivation. And it was all things that you learn and are effective tools. So you need both. You should train like a, an aura, an Orca, you develop a relationship with the orcas, the orcas learn really quickly, I want to do this because I'm being reinforced for doing. So. It's a simple as that. That's, so you sort of run with that, you develop that language. There becomes a, an understanding between, especially over the years as you grow this, this relationship, the animals know and the animals, the animals I work with every one of them. I'd never met a single animal that I wasn't incredibly like good natured, just really good and really wanted to please.

Speaker 4:          00:08:27       So it's not very difficult to train an Orca, especially when applying the positive reinforcement. So if that's the case and how does it happen that you, you, you hear stories about like these animals being corralled up in small cages with or small pens with a bunch of them like stuck right next to each other and how they deprive them of food for punishment. Like is that bullshit? No, no, that's absolutely not bullshit. That's a, how does that happen? I think what we're talking about is something that happened a lot like a long time ago. Rather it is what does system amalgamated or turned into, you know, the, the more of the positive reinforcement aspect. But when you look at that, you're, you're trying to suggest the negative reinforcement aspect of it where hey you're, you're being bad, so I'm going to shove you over here.

Speaker 4:          00:09:08       This would be more of a circumstance where you can't positively reinforce an animal for doing something because they're not doing anything that is desired by design of the positive reinforcement technique. So whatever's going on here, you're avoiding inadvertently by avoiding, you're not rewarding, you're not feeding your withholding food. So this is a lot of talk and hold on a second. This is a lot of talk to try to answer one simple question. Why did they put them in a pen like squished all next to each other? I'm really confused. While in what situation would they be? I mean they had at any fun. So are you saying they don't do that anymore? That's because what I've read about them treating, like one of the big things that people were complaining about was that they would pack all these animals into these pens and put them next to each other in these tanks and they really had no room to move and they want it biting each other sometimes.

Speaker 4:          00:09:56       Oh, tiny tanks. I mean all facilities have different sized tanks or options to mix or divide animals or whatever. So, and that they would deprive them of food if you are depriving the animal of food, that would work in the sense that if you had animals in one environment and you want them to go in another, a place where the animal didn't want to go, you can't reinforce that animal if it's not going through that gate. So the idea is you're going to try to coax that animal through positive sort of short, short steps. You know these, these approximations and you reinforce each approximation. Eventually they go in, you're reinforcing them, you're giving them that reward for going through, but if they're not going through, you can't reinforce him. So it's actually, it's deprivation in that sense. What does it feel like to train something that you know is probably misunderstood and really smart like a killer whale or an Orca?

Speaker 4:          00:10:44       They're probably pretty misunderstood by most people, don't you think? Absolutely. 100% there are super intelligent creatures, right? Like it's hard to it. I don't like to, it's hard to call them an animal just because you know there's definition, whatever that is of animal and there's a stark contrast between humans and animals in whatever it is. Whatever that definition is. When it comes to [inaudible] and intelligent beings, there's no contrast between humans and, and I want to say animals as a whole because they have best interests. They have, you know, they have objectives. I'm not sure that there is conscious of those objectives. Maybe they are. How do we know? Well we know about brain size and we know about how much activity's going on. And I see, I see what you're saying to a certain extent about some animals, but looking at rats eyes and tell me he's like thinking about poetry. Okay. Maybe his looking at dolphins eyes and there's a big difference. There's a big difference between making eye contact with the marine mammal. There's something weird about them. They're very smart. They're very smart. They're very smart in a weird way. Like where it's like what's going on in there? Like that seems like almost like a person in a weird outfit. Spiritual way for sure. Is that the most fucked up aspect

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       about places where they have them in tanks? Cause it seems to me that that's like we're going to watch slavery, we're going to watch slavery of an animal that we don't, we don't understand what they're saying. So we think it's okay to just lock them up. That's a perspective that your capable of exercising. But when people are sitting there in front of their TV and they watch that jingle come on or whatever and you know, seaworld jingle where I led a candidate jingle, hey, that's fun. They go there, they blocked out a lot of the things. They paid a lot of money to be there. They're there to be entertained, that there to be happy. They shut their brains off to a lot of things. You know, maybe there's an inclination for a second that's messed up right there, but I think that they, at the end of the day, they're looking to be entertained and they get that music and the splish splash.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       You got wet. Hey, I'm happy. I'm going home. Happy my kids happy. We'll do something weird about wanting animals to do our bidding. There's something weird about those dog shows. Those dog shows aren't just about how cute your dog is. Those dog shows us about your dog being just on fucking point listening to you every step of the way. Being completely trained stopped when you stopped prancing. When you tell it to prance, all that stupid shit. That doesn't mean anything like bears bouncing a fucking ball on the tip of their nose. That doesn't mean anything either, but if you can get me a band that can ride a bike and bounce a ball up on his head, I'm going to make you a millionaire is a bunch of assholes out there that want to see this stupid fucking bear, do some shit that any normal person can do.

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       It's, it's weird, right? It's an affinity for, for almost for that dominance to assert your dominance on something and people do it to humans every single day as well. But certainly with animals, when, I mean animals don't speak English, I don't speak any other language for that matter, but they do speak their own and they can't express to us like, Hey, like maybe let me Outta here. Well, they're speaking the language and that's something that is really hard for people to understand. There's a difference between some sounds that animals make that would indicate that there's some sort of communication going on and a pure language. Dolphins, whales, Orcas, they have a language like this. It's not as small as a few grunts and it's so complex and weird and it's so sound based, we can't even decipher it. We, we have ideas that they're saying the same thing, but there's dialects.

Speaker 2:          00:14:00       They're from different areas where they do it like it's so complex that it's like our human language just we don't understand it and we can't crack it. So because of that, because we can't hear their screams, we just put them in these fucking tanks. It's really dark because we don't consider them to be intelligent because they can't manipulate things with their fingers because they can't build housing. Let's just walk out. They can't walk out. They can't get out there, but in their world and the world of the ocean, you don't need thumbs. He don't need any of that. In fact, we would be like terribly designed for the ocean if we were forced to become marine animals and things would change radically and quickly. All right. The placement of our air hole is a fucking stupid place. The way your mouth works, a stupid, you can't really close it. Good can be fat. He can't be fat. Can't be lazy. You can't be lazy. You got to move

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       24 hours a day. You barely, you don't even really sleep right. Well they, they sleep while they're in motion. You almost wonder if just the pure instinct to survive and, and maybe limiting oneself language or species language isn't more genius than having such an elaborate language. Cause you almost wonder if we don't communicate as effectively as we could because we know too many damn words. Like, you know, how much language is expressed and how, how you see each other and how we, you know, well then all the things that we've invented that we have to name and then the interaction of those things in places that we've invented, like cities and airplanes and cars, all those things that we've invented. I'll take on a whole new school of vocabulary on their own. Yeah. It's fucking ridiculous. John Lennon said like, imagine a world with no borders, no nothing.

Speaker 5:          00:15:36       And I think he's imagining the land of the Orca is really know what they say Lando, but essentially he's envisioning an ocean. Yeah. But he also married Yoko Ono. That's, it was a silly bitch. You know, a lot of people are big John Lennon fans. They don't want to miss that. But come on son, you got to look at everything that guy says with a grain of salt. I showed my girlfriend like a video of Yoko Ono. She's like, I didn't even know Yoko Ono does that. The whole like all this screaming. She's like, oh, what's this amount? That's Yoko Ono. Strange. Um, yeah, that's not good. But the sound of Orcas is probably, you know, for a lot of people it sounds like Yoko ono underwater. It's pretty easy go. Ironically. You know, it's kind of does maybe John Lennon was, was onto something. He was, I think he just, he had a weakness there.

Speaker 5:          00:16:19       It was. We all have weakness. Yeah. Um, so like, do you think that there's gonna come a point in time where they will be able to solve and doll decipher dolphin language and realize like what you're doing is imprisoning humans? They're there. It's essentially just as bad as if we found a group of blue people. They were people, but they were blue. Put them in a cage. We couldn't understand a word they said. They would talk like dolphins, like make crazy noises that we couldn't decipher but clearly talking to each other and we just decided to put them in blue people world. You'd be rich quick. Yeah, I mean we would do that. Of course that would be a little harder to sell because they look closer to us because of fingers and shit. But if you could just realize that a dolphin is probably just like the Ma, the mind of a person or maybe even weirder, maybe even more intense and a lot of ways this cerebral, emotional, more emotional.

Speaker 5:          00:17:11       They're the basis of their language and their and their being. They're just so such a social animal and they have such like long and deep social structure, social dynamics, family bonds, so deep that at the end of the day it's like these guys, you almost have to wonder if they're more by far more intelligent and more like sympathetic than we are because that's where we lack is were were dicks. They're not dicks. One of the interesting things is that dolphins don't really kill people except for in captivity. And I've read something online, somebody wrote, but it turned out to be total bullshit. But it was kind of funny that a guy said that dolphins used to kill people up until World War II because in World War II, the fighter

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       pilots started using, not dolphins, but orcas started using a Orca as, as target practice. And the orcas realize, all right, we'd better not fuck with people. They got the under. So word got out and now they don't kill people anymore. It sounds hilarious. Uh, but it turned out to be bullshit. But it's fascinating. If it was true, but they're that smart did, the point is like they actually could do that. If they found out that people were shooting people, they would probably tell each other. They'd be like, hey man, you hear that? That sounds,

Speaker 6:          00:18:15       eh,

Speaker 4:          00:18:17       dive, go under the, um, I mean, it's, the relationship that we have with them is very bizarre and we're going to be incredibly embarrassed if we find out what they're actually saying. One day we realize what we've done. All these people go into slave world. You're going to slave world, you're going to watch slaves do flips. I've been privy to like probably some messages that I know would be beating the shit out of me even more than the shit kicking I've already taken since having left that Gig. So yeah. What do you mean? Well, the idea that if you're listening to it, if we decipher what the dolphins sang, I mean I've had to do some, I've, I've had to do some things with dolphins like you know, let's speak hypothetically just for a second. Okay. On my lawyer's advice. So let's assume that a green dolphin comes in and let's call it an elderly dolphin.

Speaker 4:          00:19:07       A real old male dolphin comes in, so he's just been captured via Jospin capture, just been captured, who knows, a month before he was out in the wild his whole life, his whole life and old man, wise, old man comes in with a group of about six, seven others, mostly young, really aesthetically pleasing animals. And this one just is not prepared to stomach the life of captivity. And so what do you resort to? You start force feeding them, right. So again, just hypothetically dropping a pool, the water's down to nothing. Again. Shit, ton of dolphins green so they're not trained. They, they're swimming around that crazy and you're having to go down there, grab a towel wrapped around its rostrum which is the end of their nose there. That face, open it up and start cramming like frozen fish in there. Oh my God. What message do you think that Dolphin was probably trying to tell me?

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       So imagine if I could like, I just imagine a point like, just to go back to what you said about decipher the language, I can't imagine what I'd be processing, you know, if like if they were, if they were able to communicate on a, a language to language understanding with humans. Yeah. That's dark shit and be tough. Yeah. Now that's part of your life. I mean that was part of my life, but that's like everybody does it. If you're, if you're, if you're a trainer like that is something that you're going to have to do something that's not even the worst of days. That's just part of your life. You like part of your life is he'd take a towel, you wrapping around the dolphins face, you open it up and you stuff frozen fish in there. Try to keep my life, start injecting them right in the back injections and no one ever says, hey, maybe we should let this guy go.

Speaker 4:          00:20:38       Well, when you're in Niagara Falls, Canada, there's really nowhere that you can let them go. I mean, I'm not really specific animals. The animals we brought in were from the Black Sea. Where's the Black Sea in Russia? Russia's where there's a lot of trade in Russia. I mean they've as we speak, have some wild caught or cause that they caught in the last like month or two and they're two of the two of which in fact are being sent to soap or to Moscow to be on display during the Sochi Olympics. Wow. Fuck. Wild caught. Yeah. Horrible mood and that. Those are slaves. Those are slaves. They really are. They're slaves that will do tricks that have to do tricks if they want to live. I mean, I don't want to say if they want to live, but yeah, that's what it boils down to. You're, you're tapping into their survival mode. You read this thing about workers that their cerebral cortex is 40% larger than a human beings.

Speaker 4:          00:21:25       Like that's something's going on in there. You know what, whether it's what we like to think of his consciousness or whether it's some sort of an alternate state that they only can appreciate because they live underwater, but whatever it is, there's talent once and it seems really fucking cruel and shortsighted that we locked them up. There's a scene in black fish where you see a group of boat, a pot of about five orcas, six orchids. They're hunting a seal and in it, this woman named Lori Marino who's a neuroscientist, she's saying it's conceivable or what we've, what we've come to learn is that they're able to exercise a mind as as one. It's a singular consciousness between the group it and in the scene, the seals sitting on a, on a little ice flow, a little tiny ice pad that orcas come in all five and simultaneously a boom like this dunk, this side of the iceberg and then the other and then the wave sort of goes over and they shoot the seal over and then you're talking some serious intelligence when you start talking collective conscious and as a, as a singular conscious, now you're talking.

Speaker 4:          00:22:29       So that's some deep shit right there. They plan that out in a way that a lot of people would never figure out simultaneously as one. And it, it appears as though one is leading the show, the restaurant's system shut down and they're just going in as a, as like an army of one. It's, yeah, and they're communicating while they're doing this, they're organizing this and communicating it that they understand that I had to shut it off, man. I had to shut it off as soon as they were talking about their dorsal fins collapsing because they don't use them because they're not out there fucking using them in swimming. And they're just upright. So I mean, all that weight of that cartilage is just going to, over time, it's going to peel that sucker. Right? Fucked up. I used to scratch candy. We had a big male, uh, this, this was a massive animal, smaller than Tillikum the one that's profiled in black face, but I used to scratch rate underneath that, that sort of curvature and just peel off the dead skin farm and he be just shaking like, yeah man, I'd be hitting it hard, pulling out like a handful of dead skin.

Speaker 4:          00:23:24       Wow. Pretty Rhonda there. Wow, that's crazy. But how would they normally get that? Would they rub it off on rocks? So they wouldn't have, they wouldn't accumulate that dead skin. I mean, they're, they're constantly swimming, constantly moving. So the weight of the water, the pressure that water would keep that dorsal fin nice and erect. Right. It's because they're all that surface resting. There's nowhere for them to swim. And I mean, there's not, the pools are never deepened. I think it doesn't properly accommodate them. So, and the people that work in these facilities, how would, how do they, how do they rationalize this? How do they, the first thing that needs to be stressed as these are not bad people, people, these are people that go into these situations, assuming that this is not only like a socially acceptable thing, this isn't us, this isn't just accept that this is encouraged and, and, and celebrate it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:05       I mean, seaworld was celebrated by the masses, if you will, up until the law, the release of blackfish prior to that, they control the message. So people see that and they're just like, oh my God, that's amazing. That's beautiful and amazing. So when you're a 22 year old punk boy kid, you're thinking, Hey, I want to, I want to go get a gig doing that. That's, that's the cat's ass job right there. You get the Gig and now you're working for someone while you're 22 years old, you need a paycheck and your parents had been pounding you down for your lifetime that you could got to go up there and you don't get a good job and work as hard as you can and everything else. So you're, you're working for someone who owns this facility and you believe you're doing what's, what's your, what's in the best interest of the animals.

Speaker 4:          00:24:47       You're there to care for the animals. So you don't see the, the shitty part. You don't think, wow, I'm doing this. I never put the animal there, the animals there. It's not just there, it's, it's great that it's there. People love that it's there. This is a, this is a job that people like really want to get, get the Gig, trying to do the right thing so it's not, it's not bad people. So then the rationalizing doesn't come until you there for a really long time when you have to really start rationalizing some of the decisions that are made. Once you get closer to the upper echelon, closer to the brass and you see the decisions that are being made, you're like Jesus, but shouldn't we be doing this instead? That's when you start questioning shit and I guess it takes a really good person at that point or the better part of the people cause we never managed to keep people at our facility there.

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       I mean we were going through a lot of good people. That door was revolving in and out. Do you think that as part of that is like being disenchanted? Part of it is like realizing what you're doing. Part of it is if you're there for the right reasons, you really give a shit about those animals and it beats the shit out of you that the decisions that are being made and you're the muscle of that decision, this isn't being made. You're the muscle to execute it. You're just like, whoa, wait a second. We don't have to do that. Like that we have to do is making the decisions. Well in my experience we don't have to say names. Just like, well, I mean I was, I worked for a facility that was micromanaged by one man who's been, who's been, who's owned it now for 52 years.

Speaker 4:          00:26:03       Oh, see who owns it? He owns it. He owns the slave plantation. I can't say that I hit a launch a lot at 1.2 $5 million suit against me if I say that. So you're going to, you said that I'm going to get a lawsuit for saying that. I think I should have brought you a disclaimer. Like I don't think I should get sued for saying it's labor. I think you should have to prove that it's not. Well, if you're a super intelligent animals locked up in swimming pools, uh, what are you doing? If you've got the slavery, if you've got the money to see this process through the court, then you can then impose that on him. But if you don't have the money to defend and you're like me getting attacked, um, so the, so it's basically one person's decisions and, and then all the people that really care about the animals are, but he owns the joint.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       He has all the cash he pays you, which gets you the beer, the food. But he makes the decisions. And does he make decisions? Like does he have a background in marine biology? Like does he make educated decisions or these financial decisions or like how to, how to like the crueler aspects of the job manifest itself. But the problem with, I say the problem, but with me it's, I worked at a very unique place that they're very few facilities where it's like one guy who owns it, who's been doing this as long as you have. It's hard to rationalize his decision making. I'm going to put a big asterisk next to his name. Maybe other people, I don't know. But at the end of the day, that's obviously there's a financial aspect of the decision making. Um, but that story about that dolphin open up his mouth and forced me.

Speaker 4:          00:27:29       That's the stuff of nightmares we have to treat harbor seals like that. I just think of what it must be like to be that animal, to be sucked out of your world at an elderly age and stuffed into this tank where you know you're never getting out. We're like, there's no escape hatch. You're not going to double o seven you way out of this and fucking figure out how to unjam me the door and make your way down the dock and jumping in the water and swim to freedom. Especially in Niagara Falls. Man, you're pretty landlocked aside from some freshwater, but dolphins are going to last long there. Yeah. I try to rationalize it now. It really was only until after I left. When I quit my job, I come out in, the first thing I did was I started petitioning the Ontario government. We need rules and regulations so that these animals can live at least in an environment that that is more accommodating to them.

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       I wanted more greater animal protection laws. This is, this was the, this was the avenue I went because still I was still disillusioned to the fact that, hey, wait a second. If you delve deeper to the day one of them landing in the pool or being in that in your possession, there's a history there. Go back there and see what's what's happened there. And suddenly the more I think about that, that's when you start taking the real shit kicking. Cause you're like Holy Holy Shit. Like this animal's been through a lot. It's been through fricking lot protecting it in captivity. That's not really serving this animal a lot of like you're not doing this animal a big service like you need. You need to abolish this all together. So I would say the campaign has changed, especially with blackfish coming up. Cause people know now like this.

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       It's not, not only not fun, it's just not fun. It's just disgustingly cruel. Like that's a whole lifetime of shit for an animal. That's again, if you, if you could relate to it instead of separate yourself from it, stop looking at it as an object. Be that animal for a second. Now try to be that animal for a lot longer than a second. You all of a sudden you start feeling like pretty bad and wonder why we would expect compassion from aliens. You know? I mean, think about what we can do to some of the most obvious intelligent animals on our planet that were different from, well guess what? The idea is something coming from another fucking planet that has fingers and eyes and a nose in front of its face and looks just like you. That's a fucking stretch. More. Most likely it's going to be just as bizarre to you as an Orca is to you.

Speaker 4:          00:29:37       And so if you look at the way we treat orchids, why the fuck would we ever expect anybody to be nice to us? I used to exercise the analogy of um, of aliens with the younger trainers all the time. I'd say, look, we're aliens to these animals. You need to make this animal's environment as comfortable as possible. Bearing in mind always we are aliens. Just, you know what I mean? That's part of relating to the animals, which is they're thinking like that. You're just like, wait a second. Like I got it to start being nicer. Because if an alien comes down, I don't want that. I don't want to be, it's a stupid thing to say like it's one of those who your talking about aliens gun people like automatically go goofy with it. But the reality is it's actually, it's the right analogy because we really are aliens in their world and we're obviously supposedly intelligent.

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       We're obviously intelligent enough to figure out how to get them when intelligent enough to how to figure out how to train them, put them in tents. We can put them in tanks rather have all these people come to see him. We're obviously intelligent, have to film them theirs. They can tell there's a lot of shit going on that they don't do but they've gotta be like, God you guys are dicks. Like why are you holding onto me? Like we don't hold onto it. We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't do that. I think we killed things but we don't hold onto them. I think that's when the frustration level start boiling for these animals. Cause when they're first there, when they first arrived, he was a green animal. If there, I mean the bottom line is, it depends if they're a good candidate for captivity, but they learned real fast that, okay, that's the hand that feeds me.

Speaker 4:          00:31:04       Like I wanna I wanna I want to develop this relationship, if you will, which is the relationship of like abiding by this person's rules, right? Then again, goodwill, the animals and the other ones that are just like the same for me. There, they're there, they're cutting out and there's nothing you can do. I mean, you pull blood from them, you check that blood. There's nothing wrong with them. This animal's not sick. Why isn't it eating? And then days later, why is this animal debt did not want to be in captivity. They just starved themselves to death. I've seen it so many times, wow. The will to live loss. And you're like, that was always the most frustrating thing for me. And you're gonna make me fucking cry. Every time I ever watched an animal lose its will. That was the most that that destroyed me, that destroyed me.

Speaker 4:          00:31:46       It's like, it's over. The will is gone. You're not going to find a cause of death here. They just stopped eating style. How does the the main guy deal with all this? How does the guy owns these joints? Let's hypothetically, okay, let's not even talk about any one person in particular, but there's a bunch of these things out there. There's the, there's these, these seaworld type places all over the world, right? Like I said, Marina, animal places, whatever you want to call them. The most difficult thing you can try to do is rationalize. Especially in in my particular experience is the decision making that's going on at there. You just can't. Anything that you think is a good idea is a bad one. Do you come and direct communication with the people that own the place? I did eventually. Of course I was there 12 years, so I mean I was by all means up there and the, have you ever been there when these ideas are expressed? Have you ever been in front of like any people that own these places and say, hey, you know what we're doing is really fucked up. I don't have a job

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       no more because it was the slamming of the fist that was going on when these decisions were being made. That ultimately led to me being like the slamming of the fist. What do you mean that decision's being made? You got to do this. Okay, so this is what we do. This is how we train them. Get Out of my office. Say No, lose your job. I was that. I was the asshole who was going to get fired real soon. It's a children's movie. It's like a movie. Yeah. It's like, you know what I mean? It's like some Whoville type shit where you know you, you, you see this evil thing being perpetrated by someone who's just in it for money and not thinking about the humanity of the whole thing. It's funny you mentioned that we, we had a Christmas show we were putting together and these, there's these brothers that do these animated shorts and Canada, you know, they're, they're pretty well known.

Speaker 5:          00:33:29       Anyways, they had produced this video and they gave it to us and you know, the colleagues were like, yeah, this should be great to show it during the Christmas show. Okay. Put it in. The cartoon was of this old man who went and stole a wild baby walrus from its mother and you don't want to know exactly how those that gets done. Of course, the, the cartoons, you know, less graphic, but then he grabs a polar bear and his ideas, he's going to have these two things dual and, and fight it out. Then basically the Mont, the mother Walrus comes back and the, and the mother, a polar bear and they, you know, they get the bad guy, but we showed that video during a Christmas show. I'm watching this going, shit. That reminds me of someone. Hypothetically, hypothetically. It's, it's very, it's very sad that we don't have laws stopping this.

Speaker 5:          00:34:14       I think that's what this fights a boat. I mean that's what, that's the stink. I started along a while back. I think there's something about the zoo too. I wrote a piece a long time ago about the zoo, about it being animal prison. I eat a pot cooking and went to the zoo once. Eddie Bravo, my friend Eddie, he ate five grams of mushrooms allegedly and went to the zoo once and he said it was the most depressing thing he's ever seen his life. He said it was so sad, like the reality of what the zoo is just was in escapable, the sadness of it all. He had to get out of there and I felt like that after I eat a pot cookies, I eat a pod cookie and I went to the zoo and I sat there. I, there's a bench across from the chimpanzee and closure at the La Zoo and I sat for like a half hour, 40 minutes just staring at this one chimp just trying to think about what his life is like, what is where, where the, the the wonder of the natural, the natural world living in the jungle, living off the land, doing what they've done for fucking a million years or whatever.

Speaker 5:          00:35:12       The chimpanzees have been around that the freedom and laughter and the, they would want around fucking each other and grabbing bananas and Shit. I mean they live like ultimately in almost an Adam and eve type paradise. It's utopia man. It is with chimpanzees. It's for Utopia. I mean, yeah, there's dangerous. Sure. This jaguars, they can suddenly start protecting animals from other animals. But not only that, we have that same problem. There's a fucking mountain line. They just photographed the Hollywood hills

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       this week. Jesus Christ. It's, that's a call. Call it, they caught it at one point in time. Yeah, we're cute. We caught, we catch fucking giant monsters and we release them. We were like, be free monster. We're in your neighborhood and we respect that. You have to wonder like it took, it took your buddy like five grams or shrooms and you had one of your pot cakes to, to be able to exercise that perspective of sort of like liberating yourself from all the bullshit, like the flashing lights, the neon disasters, everything else. And I think that's why people rationalize, cause they're always a nun data with everything so much that they can't just for a second sit down and stare at that animal's eyes just for a second. And if it scares you, don't turn away because the first thing people that are just, first thing I'll do is I just, I just exercise too much attention.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Then it's also, there's, there's the issue of it being there already and when it's their running, it's sanctioned and you see adults walking back and forth pushing strollers, it seems like it's okay. And I look, I'm a hypocrite because I take my kids to the zoo, they love the zoo. Then they're young and they, they enjoy looking at animals and it's fascinating to be there live and see a giraffe like whoa. And to feed the Giraffe, I get it. You know, I get it, but it's, it's probably better if we didn't have it. It's, it seems like a fucked up thing. And this is coming from a deer hunter. You know, I'd like hunting animals. I like eating animals. I've been a mediator my whole life. But I don't think you should lock them up. I think they should be free. I think the wild animals, you know, there they are.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       There's some, there's something magical and special about seeing something in the wild, something that's moving around living its life. There's something inherently sad about seeing something we took from the wild and then made it live in a city. It doesn't replicate that experience in any capacity. What's it now? Is it not replicated? Like we don't give a fuck. We're just saying we don't care what we, I know what you like, but getting there. I want to say we used to not give a fuck though. Do you think people were more aware now? I don't doubt that for a second. If there's a physical huge paradigm shift, like people are not interested in seeing that no more with everything. I think a lot of things, I think with life itself, I think what we're experiencing now because of the Internet is a reality that never existed before.

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       A way of communicating that we're never existing, that it never existed before. And I think the amount that it's changing us, it's happening so rapidly and it's so deep that we have a hard time understanding what's really going on. I think we're in the middle of a hurricane of information and it's changing every single aspect. It's changing things for the good and for the bad. It's changing things in weird ways. It's uh, there's a lot of confirmation bias because of it. A lot of people are grouping up on online find likeminded morons who believe the earth is hollow and that there's fucking a certain group of people that live in the middle of it. You could find a message board with those people will believe you and they'll, they'll go with you. There's just this weird aspects to this, but that it's select the inevitable aberrations and this fucking rolling tsunami of of ones and Zeros and information that's coming our way. I think on a whole, the larger like demographic of people,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       you know, not, not the, not the tiny pockets, but there's probably some relativity between the tiny pockets and the masses are pretty sick of it. Like you know, I don't know. Like I think they think about it for the most part. That's what I was going to say is like, because it's there because the zoos are already there. You don't think about it cause sea world's already there. You don't think about it. It's their adults are running it. See, hey, hi. How are you? I'm assuming there's rules. You assume there's rules and there's regulations and like, oh they must be doing something right because look, it's being celebrated like Holy Shit like that. That looks kind of small, but they must know something we don't. So it must be perfectly calm down to sea world guy, the director, he's so friendly. He's waving at everybody. He wouldn't be mean to the dolphins to get him to jump.

Speaker 4:          00:39:13       While you're not mean to the dolphin though, this is the difficult, like this is the thing. When you're, when you're there, you don't think you're being mean. You're being mean by plucking a moat. That's really fucking mean. But asking them to do the jump and training them to do the jump. You don't exercise that perspective that you're being mean. So I, I worked with a lot of the seaworld breasts that are in black fish and you know, it isn't until after you see what the, what they're saying in court, some of the things they're doing you just like, that guy was awesome. He was a nice guy, man. Like that guy's a dick. What kind of things in Cordy talking about well, lies of course lies allegedly lies or let's say, let's pretend these people that aren't even real people, there are two tranches that are on trial.

Speaker 4:          00:39:52       Um, what are they guilty of and what are they claiming? Well, there's your Angeles. I mean, even people at the end of the day, they're trying to keep their business very viable, keep the rules out the trenches, have an aunt business they run, they train aunts and they get these ants to do flips. Well, they pay people very little money to train them. They pay people very little money. They convinced those people who are legitimately good and animal caring. You know, people that care for animals that are, they're going to convince them that what they're doing, it's good. Pay Them. Very little put, you know, there's a system of oppression. There were, like I said before, this, that hammer, that fist comes down and you're, now you're the muscle. Like the idea is here, you don't like the idea, but you're the muscle to execute it or these profitable businesses.

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       Oh Shit. I thought if you knew what I was up against in Niagara Falls and I can fall, it's not a big place. If you knew what I was up against in Niagara Falls to be like, is it profitable? Like is it, did they yield a lot of influence? Um, at every level of government and everything else? Yeah, maybe. What did, what did you do that you got in trouble for? What happened? So I quit my job and I didn't get in trouble for that. Why'd you quit? Couldn't do it. You couldn't do it anymore. You just hit a breaking point. I hit a breaking point long before I quit. And so the quitting was like a mist. What was like the craziness after you go beyond that threshold of a breaking point. So yeah, I got out. So before you quit you are making stink, stink big stinks. What were you doing? I was trying to keep from keep what was going on from happen, from continuing. I was trying to stop, I was trying to fix an otherwise really big problem, like a glaringly evident that problem that everyone is seeing. Like we got a big problem here. Who's going to, who's going to fight to change this? You start looking around and

Speaker 4:          00:41:37       yeah, that's not happening. This avenue is not exercising it. This one pretends to be ready to exercise something, but

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       So then you got it. You just say it's very difficult for you to communicate this because of the fact that you have a lawsuit going on. So you're dancing around stuff a little bit. I got a dance a little bit. Yeah. When? Once the trailer? Yeah. Yeah. Let's watch a trailer. Okay. Hold on one sec.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:42:00       What does the trailer for explaining blackfish official trailer shit

Speaker 1:          00:42:07       the fuck out. When you look into their eyes, he knows somebody gets home. An animal that possesses great spiritual power not to be metal. Yes. Bye County sheriff's office.

Speaker 7:          00:42:28       We need to reform for the world.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:42:34       a whale

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       telecom. How is the one that went after her and dawn is the senior trainer here at Shampoos Stadium. She captured what it means to be a sea world trainer. That it made me realize what happened to her. Really could've happened to anyone. I've been expecting somebody to be killed by telecom. We weren't told much about it other than it was trainer. It didn't just happen. It's not a thing. Killer adventure. You have to go back to understand this speed. Boats and heard of the man and make could just pick out the young ones. This was the worst thing.

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       Oh. When Tillikum arrived at seaworld, he was twice as large as the next animal meat store. These whales, you don't want to call a module which was 20 feet across and 30 feet deep and the lights were all term. No, probably led to what I think is a psychosis. Oh Wales captivity, all psychologically traumatized. It's not just telecom. If you were in a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think you'd get a little psychotic? Dawn would tell you that it was her mistake they blamed for, that's just a bold face lies. I was just instructed to get rid of it. Dang street has a vested interest in spinning things that sells a lot of sham dolls. It sells a lot of tickets. Set the gate. There was no record of the Norco doing any harm. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:44:18       You should just watch that. They should play that for the judge and the judge who go, stop. This fucking case is over. This thing's not going to cart. It's a slap suit. It's a strategic lawsuit against public participation. He wants me broke. He wants me to not be able to get through this judicial process, which right off the hop is really expensive, but when you see something like black fish come out, that's got to support your cause tremendously. Uh, I like to think I'm an a can't lose situation. Like this thing has been building the craziest momentum off the hop. It was, I mean, that's a scary endeavor. Doing what we did, being where we are. That's scary shit. What does that mean? Doing what we did? What did you do? A newspaper called? They found out the Walrus guy quit his job. They want to know why you were the Walrus trainer, the Walrus, the walrus trainer among other things, among other things. They want to know why you pick up that phone and you're amidst the scariest, the scarier parts of depression and you're not touching that. You're not touching that. I got, I got things to process like, um, I'm not touching that. And then a situation, a scenario unfolds where suddenly you realize you have to touch that someone has to, and so you pick up the phone.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:38       And then 14 other people for that matter, wind up picking up the phone. As you know, these stories start to, as this investigation continues,

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:49       The decision I made different than than other people, for instance, and I can understand and appreciate why they had their reasons I do. Mine is to not use your face and image. I said, go ahead. It's, it's filled Merce, it's filled. Immerse. Who's talking to this newspaper right now? Go ahead. Something has to be done. Newspaper prints. Front page, shit gets crazy. It doesn't just last for a day or two. And what was the allegations? What did you, what did you accuse him of or what was the, what was the big revelation? Well,

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:26       The facility that I worked at, animals were suffering.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:30       Simple as that. Simple as suffering. Just basic reality. The reality of those facilities. Every animal suffers in those places. They suffer from a lack of freedom. Yes. Right? Yes. This one, there's an, this is an exceptional case. We had serious short staffing issues over the years. I mean, I watched that department go like this went from, they don't experience staff to like what's going on here? Like what do we, what are we down to? And then there was like a mechanical breakdown in a, the water disinfection units, a big one. Oh, the water was nasty. Oh, and instead of dumping the water, instead of addressing the issue over the course of the off season, I remembered week closed. You know, we're only a in operation for like five months out of the year. And then thereafter we're close to the public because it's so cold because it's so cold, so cold.

Speaker 4:          00:47:18       So then, so amidst that, you know, the water disinfection unit breaks in, let's say August or September. We closed in like October. Well now we're in November, December, January. It's steeped. We're opening in May. This is bad. And the resolve, just a little history. As far as the, the water disinfection unit goes, we're talking about an ozone machine. Ozone, the way it works, it works in conjunction with chlorine. It, it, it allows for you to use less chlorine to disinfect the water. Ozones out. Well, how are you gonna how are you going to treat the water in a purse in a, in a less than rational person thinking person's mind? You may think it's a good idea to put a shit ton of chlorine in and a lot and repeatedly in really scary doses when employees aren't around overnight. For instance. And this went on and this continued to go on and that's when I couldn't do it no more.

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       I can't do this. So you knew that these animals are basically being poisoned by all the chlorine, that there was something terrible, was serious damage done. Fuck, lots of serious damage done. Is there a movement at all to, to outlaw these things now after something like blackfish? So I petitioned the Ontario government to enact or to create stronger animal protection laws, which they just announced to throw in five and a half million dollars a year instead of half a million dollars to the Eos PCA to, to correct this issue. The OSP, the, the, uh, agency that, well, I don't have a lot of good things to say about them. I think we'll leave it at that for now. But I hate that there's an animal protection. I know at the thing and that they handle orcas and dolphins. Well, they, they don't though. They should. I mean, they shouldn't. It should be like we should, it should be the department of humanity.

Speaker 4:          00:49:06       You know, they should, people should be able to get together, take a look at one of those things, get close to them and go, okay, what are we doing here? This is where my efforts wet from animal protection and uh, you know, regulations and standards of care to abolishment. It's got to go right in Canada. You can't capture, uh, any whales in your own water. Can't do it, can't get a permit, is not gonna exist. You can buy from Russia, you could buy from Japan. Any of these drive, uh, hunts, uh, the, you know, similar to the orchids that are shipped to, to Russia. They w you can catch him in a wild, bring them in to ship them down. I'm trying to have that outlawed. Like, you should not be able to do that in Canada no more. And I'm working my ass off, made a big stink and we're still only this far.

Speaker 4:          00:49:52       They're this far being around the world and like it just, anytime pub people listening you're like not very far. Well, it doesn't take, it doesn't take long for a government. Someone else to step in and say, what are we talking about? Oh, we've got to talk about jobs, and then you're gone. You know, you're in the back seat of the bus again, way at the back and you're like, okay, I've got to start claw my way back up. How am I going to get, make a stink again? And then southern, like blackfish comes out. I saw this dude when telecom was as his name telecom till when Tillikum killed that lady. I'm the trainer that I saw this guy freaking out about it. Like this disgusting beast. They should kill this thing. It was, it was fascinating. He was a, I don't know where he was from.

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       It was from another country, but he was talking to his friend about it and it was interesting to watch that site. Some, some people's perspectives are so off like this. This is like some Parana in there that's eating. People like that thing is looking at fish's eyes like a Paranas eyes. You know, he buys, I'll be looking at a Budweiser bottle. They're fucking idiots. Everyone in blackfish said the same thing. They're like telecom was the nicest Orca ever. I knew candy big male. I knew Ike Tillikum son. We had till it comes soon until, see where we'll actually successfully sued marine land to have him remove and uh, we can, how do they do that? They know what they know. How do they do that? How do they separate them from their children? Ike Ike was an amazingly beautiful animal. Good natured. He was going to kill someone.

Speaker 5:          00:51:11       He was going to kill someone. Wow. No. Now is there like regulation on how small the the tanks can be? If we got nothing and Ken, if you, Hey, listen, if you're ever hard up, if let's say tomorrow, you're like, shit, I need it. I need a really high paying gig. Just come to Ontario, dig a hole. I know a couple of guys with the bacco. Well dig a hole. We'll fill it with whatever you want. I got the contacts in Russia, you'll have, you'll call them, you'll buy a couple of dolphins will throw him in there. Boom, you're money's made and you don't have to worry about anything. No regulatory bodies. There's no import laws. There is nothing. It's, it's the wild, wild west is there. Like that's incredible. Is there, are there new ones that are being made now? Like they're, they're making like a new, no often world.

Speaker 5:          00:51:56       Well, in Toronto they actually just opened the Ripley's aquarium. They have sharks, they've got other sharks. I don't give a fuck about sharp. They've got animals. But you have to sort of wonder like what's the environmental impact is of actually getting those shark. He started thinking there. You're like, well, that, that, that seems pretty shitty. Yeah. Well, no doubt. We're fucking the ocean up. There's no doubt about that. And I, I'm with you on that and I'm, you know, I'm even with you on the idea of like, I don't think, I don't really have a problem with sharks at an aquarium. I know, I see them swimming around, they get fed. I think they're stupid. They're dumb killing machines and it doesn't really bother me. My problem is with things that are thinking, but that exact perspective that you're exercising right now, we may very well find out otherwise in 50 years be like, Holy Shit, look what we're doing.

Speaker 5:          00:52:42       The sharks, like they're mad geniuses, we must find something. Who knows, right? Yeah, maybe. But it doesn't seem like there's any natural advantage to them being intelligent. They're basically just swing their steam machines. Yeah, they're all they're doing, I mean obviously I'm joking around, I don't think we should make sharks extinct. And I do think that the impact that we're having on all marine life is pretty profound. It very disturbing and not that disgust. I mean, occasionally you'll see an article online about the garbage patch in the Pacific and then the several other patches that they found all over the country, all over the world, rather, where there's these whirlpools generate these areas where there's just a massive con con condensed garbage and plastic and gyres. They're called Texas sized. Yeah. But you know what happens is filled with shit. Anyone decides to start reading up on that.

Speaker 5:          00:53:31       And then what happens is the right wing media sort of comes in and it's just like, no, no, no. I've heard these guys are all activists. Exactly. I've heard that and I've actually had conversations online with people about that with like, look, it's not that big a deal. It's not that big. It's you've got to realize the perspective of the oceans and norm. It's the size of Texas man. This is an area the size of Texas has little pieces of plastic floating around in silence. An expert, right, and it's like goop apparently. It's like a lot of the plastic is sort of dissolves this weird consistency and animals wind up eating it, opening up these animals and seeing plastic figurines like army figurines in them. Like that's pretty crazy. Albatrosses a lot of their mother, the mother Albatross doesn't know the plastic is and thinks it's some kind of food, so she feeds it to the babies and there was this one island that is a uninhabited by people, but it's a major island for these albatrosses and this photographer went over there and took all these photographs of albatrosses can hear that.

Speaker 5:          00:54:24       Obviously all these photographs of albatrosses with plastic inside of their bodies. Yeah, I saw that in the nests. Like so fucked. So weird. But if you're not there and you're the person that sees this and if you don't look away immediately as it scares you or caused us concern that how you're going to know you just let it go. You don't care. Well it's also the same thing as the zoo. It's key. It's always been there. You know, there's always been garbage in the ocean, whatever, whatever. It's not my responsibility to fix this. Someone out there is a real grownup. Someone out there is older than me and wiser and has the role of the head of the Department of fucking keeping fish alive and he's going to keep it together. That's the perspective. That's exercise. The second anyone even thinks about going to these places.

Speaker 5:          00:55:10       Oh, we're going to that place where the people who know what they're doing or doing that thing that we all love and that is awesome. So let them do their job fill. The guys are trying to keep the, wasn't for them. No one would even give a fuck about orchids. The Japanese would be killing them and making sandwiches with dolphins. They got away with that for a long time. They controlled the message. Now all of a sudden with you, like you say the binary digits, the information that you know, the information superhighway, we're all learning. Yeah. We're all learning. So what happened with you? So you get out of there, you, you, you do this, you do this story. You tell everybody what the fuck's going on. When is the lawsuit happened and what is the lawsuit? The lawsuit doesn't happen for a bit. The lawsuit first.

Speaker 5:          00:55:46       The, the first thing they do is they make it very difficult for they allegedly, I mean it's an, it's an obligation, but they allegedly make things very difficult for my girlfriend who's been working there for 12 years as well. She's actually Kiska the loan Orkos head trainer. Okay. And things start becoming really difficult for her. She still worked there? No, in the off season, they, they fired her fast. They had to, they had to, uh, it was costing them a lot of money for information to continue to be leaked. I assume that they probably thought it was coming from her, but there were a lot of people talking at this time because the story wasn't just one story that come out. When I had spoken to the media, this thing went on for like eight months

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       a year. They're still talking about, there's still stories coming out of this thing, uh, since the lawsuits, uh, former employees and certainly current deployed or not talking, but so first thing they did was made things exceptionally difficult for her and then they fired her and then they sued her. Then they waited awhile or they sued her for defamation because there was a video that was provided to, um, the newspaper and in the video there's a, the orcas tail is bleeding, it's bleeding. And in the news article, she as a former employee who had just been fired, said, I'm concerned for the killer whale because she's bleeding. And so they're suing her for defamation. Again, it's called a slap suit. They're not a 10th. Sue You for saying that you're concerned when you're a trainer. They could sue me for anything. It doesn't matter. It doesn't. The lawsuit is there. Slap suits. Again, they have, they're there. They don't have any real, like there's nothing tangible there and they could write a fiction story about you. You got to get a lawyer retain one that's five k off the hop. If you're lucky, then you got to submit a statement of defense. That's another couple of thousand dollars. Kickstarter. I got an Indiegogo. Well, I'm on my fourth Indiegogo, uh, fundraising campaign right now. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       How do, I know this is not an elaborate scheme between you and the owner of that place to just make Indiegogo money. Can you look up the video that you guys are pretending that you're a war? Maybe let's, can you just, just sucking saps into pain, Indiegogo money.

Speaker 4:          00:57:52       Just go on Youtube and put up like marine land animals suffering and we'll go to the video. You could, you can see, listen, I'm just fucking around and I know, I don't know. It might be worth to watch anyways. I don't know that you've seen it. I mean you don't want to see blackfish.

Speaker 2:          00:58:03       Honestly, I don't want to see anymore. It is pretty brutal. It's all the very depressed. Don't pull up any of that shit. I don't want to see it. I know what's going on and I think now the real conversation isn't like repeating the same images and watching the same videos or we don't need to go there. I think what we need to do now is figure out how we're going to stop these things from being legal because this is what I'm doing in Ontario at least. Right? Yeah. I think it needs to be done. I think the people that own these places, I know that they've made a living doing this for a long time and I believe some of them probably do have a real love for these animals, but people didn't need to stop. Everyone need to stop. The trainers need to stop. They need to stop. It's, it's dark. It's just too fucked up. You're, you're, you're in slaving intelligent animals.

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       It's tough to get to the trainers. They're young people who's going, who are going to get a kick ass gig. That's the Gig. I mean, again, paradigm shift. Up until a year ago, this was the case. Now, you know, with the, with the Toronto Star investigation in the marine land with blackfish, people are now just like, Whoa, like what that commercial said? It was awesome. Remember that jingle like that was awesome. Why is this job shitty? Why are these animals being tortured? Yeah. Now they know, but again, the, the industry control the information for so long. So Russia is still ganking them out of the water. We don't do that anymore. Uh, the states don't, you need a to import from anywhere. And because what happens is to, to apply for a permit, there's a period of like public, a opinion or whatever. They sort of write in and basically these agencies get the shit kicked out on.

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       Someone really needs to make a movie where a human gets kidnapped and taken to an alien fucking human world. That will be a fascinating movie. When he got taken to some alien version of seaworld and humans are doing fucking cartwheels and shit, I'd be the right time. It's a leap. Like that could totally be like some crazy avatar type movie where they would have meetings to decide when human is allowed to be transferred to another facility, removed them from their families, or are you going to have an incessant scene? Because that's what goes on. A lot of these facilities really with the trainers, not with the trainer stone. What are you saying? The animals. The animals. Of course there's not enough natural selection. There's not enough out there. You've got to get the killer whales. It's difficult to bring them in, so they just want to fuck in their daughters and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:00:16       They don't want to, but if you get them at the right time and they're frustrated enough, I imagine, I can't rationalize why medically candy would do that to the Osha, but that, that conceivably to happen so dark. That's so dark. Yeah, that was a tough one. Oh, it's so dark. It's just fucking torture all around. It's so crazy that no one recognizes that and it's because they'd been extracting money from this. This being sanctioned for a long time. It's generated a tremendous amount of money and they've gotten addicted to that money and they can't find another way to make money. They can't open up a barbecue shop. They can't fucking sell hats. I want to sell cowboy boots. Fuck this dolphin training. Know everybody keeps doing the same thing over and over again because it's always been a viable job. They reinvested the money in government lobbying.

Speaker 4:          01:01:00       They reinvest that money in controlling the message through the media. They reinvested the money, you know, making the right friends. And if you saw, if you knew, especially in the small community of Niagara Falls in Ontario, what the angles and the things that are happening, it's like, are you kidding me? Like I assumed I was up against some tough, I knew it was gonna be difficult to try to get these laws and it was not gonna be easy. I mean, who? Who passes laws, who lobbied to pass laws? These laws that are coming out are jokes, man. They're jokes. They don't address what was, what was the big stink a year ago when these stories come out? Like what? Wow, there's, oh, the laws that basically the Ontario government just celebrated the announcement because again, this was a big stink about when we had come out and we petitioned the Ontario government, um, they made a law or I'd rather, they said, we're going to create standards of care for marine mammals.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       We're going to enhance our animal protection. It sounds good. They announced all, the only thing they announced thus far is another announcement of, uh, standards of care to come, which are going to be, which are going to be weighed against the impact of communities. So suddenly taking care of a dolphin has something to do with whether or not Joe Schmo down the street gets a job from the facility around the corner. There's a relate, there's, that's relative somehow bullshit. But that's apparently coming. And again, we built in a long time for these fricking, you know, it's always announcements of announcements. Then they announced an influx of cash to the OSP, 5 million extra dollars a year to protect animals. Always Pca, Bung this thing up. The owner, allegedly the owner of marine land bought the land that the Osp ca operates out of. And I recall in my history seeing quite frequently the LSPC agents coming in and we're talking like what does that sound stand for?

Speaker 4:          01:02:37       Ontario Society of prevention of cruelty to animals. Okay, so if there's animal cruelty happening, you would assume that these are the people that are going to come in and say, Hey, stop that now and you know, write a fine or something. But well when their office is in the building on the land that was donated by the owner of the park, that becomes a bit of a conflict of interest cause I don't know that that that individual is being paid 10 bones and hour to drive around from facility to facility. If that job should have come a is going to turn around and be like, hey man, like we're shutting you down because that chlorine that's causing a animal's eyes to bleed, uh, skin to flake off all sorts, everything else that's cruel. There's just, it's very thin. The rules are not there. The other thing about the Ontario be seen, the offices are on seaworld properties that we were saying.

Speaker 4:          01:03:24       No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying in my case or hypothetically, the owner of mine, not hypothetically matter of factly, the owner of my, the facility that I worked at bought the land and donated it to the Osp ca of which there, uh, office, uh, uh, of which they operate out of. That's hilarious. It doesn't stop. It doesn't end there man. It doesn't, where's it end? Well, it ends with me fighting lawsuits. Right, right, right. When you say it doesn't end there, like what else? What other ways? That's hilarious. The fat. I mean, that's like heroin dealers donating money to the cops. Like, here, we're going to buy your fucking police station. Let us keep dealing heroin, please. So what happened with me? So basically the, the newspaper outlet, the media outlet that took our story and ran with it really, really beat the shit and exposed a lot of things.

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       Okay. Marine land hires this gentleman by the name of John Beatty. He's the former McGinty senior adviser. Mcginty was the, uh, was the prime minister or rather the premier of Ontario, this guy, the owner Marineland high or rather rather marine land. The corporation hires John Beatty, former advisor to the liberal government. A gentleman by the name of uh, Shit, I'm drawing a blank, but anyways, uh, hires this senior, uh, you know what I'm talking about if I'm consulting, whatever. So this guy comes out with a shit ton of spins, videos and everything else, and then he starts shaking the hands of all the friends and the liberal government. So when the announcement of these new rules come out, you're like, of course nothing's coming out. You just hired the premier's ex chief advisor. He knows all the fricking people. What are you talking about? Then you start looking at it at the local level of all the government, while the, the, the, the Ministry of Environment.

Speaker 4:          01:05:06       The minister is a friend of the owners as well. There's great deal of history everywhere, here, everywhere. So everything one by one can remember a lot of agencies went in there to it to investigate. They took a really long time sort of releasing their findings and everything sort of went by the wayside. Slowly but surely there's there throw a lawsuits around like like a candy at Halloween, but everything else is just sort of, because you know, the stink sort of mellowed out didn't it? You know, you make a stink now in a year. Well a lot of things are in the news now that are different for that matter. Mcginty drop like that stepped down. So I lost that here I had to uh, this premiere that was going to, yeah, we're going to do something real sad about this. Then he bails out. I'm like, okay, what happen to those laws we were working on?

Speaker 4:          01:05:51       Because you know, I was, I was going traveling back and forth to Queen's Park. I was speaking with the Minister of community safety. You know, she's the one responsible for the OSP. Ca Acts. She's going to change things and I'm talking to her, we're going to change things and I think we are, I really believe this. I can't believe I'm making a change and in the world here I get sued for doing that. I'm getting sued now I'm in a lawsuit. Holy Shit. Well she can't talk to me. Oh, that, that's in the courts now. Can't talk no more. And then everything's falling by the wayside. I'm like, Holy Shit. Like turns out like defending animals is a really scary thing to do. Well, it's not

Speaker 5:          01:06:20       really just defending animals. What you're doing is you're going up against a machine, you're going up against a machine that generates money and as a bunch of people that are profiting from it. Right. So what's happening? Big machine big. And at the end of the day it's all about it comes down to the monies. It comes down to the monies and these police facilities generate. Now when your situation start and when was black? Black fist was only released like a month ago or two, right? Uh, on CNN, like a month and change ago. Yeah. And when did your scenario fired? When it all caught up pass.

Speaker 4:          01:06:48       August 15th of last year was the day that our story come out. And again, it wasn't just me. We were like eight or nine people at that point that it kept building cause more stories would come out like, and then more people would come out until the lawsuit started dropping. Right. That's when people are like, what? And you, you don't plan on suing them back. Oh, I'm suing them back. What are you suing them back for? Well, defamation, number one, they really, well they released a video of me calling me an animal liberation army leading like they turned around and made me eat meat. I used to eat meat. I used to exclusively, I was a meat and potato guy pounded all day. Now I'm having a real tough time. Like I'll, I'll eat meat, but when I do, I feel guilt so it makes it less appetizing. I can't get off cheese. I'm off milk, you know, eating a hell of a lot healthier, exercising more, you know, different things happening and you try to clear your mind. When I processing this,

Speaker 5:          01:07:39       I have a friend who's a vegetarian, he eats eggs because eggs come from chickens. They just lay them. Then they're not, we have this idea that eggs going to become a chick. They're not the chickens lay eggs every day. Um, and he'll eat meat if somebody he know killed it if it's hunted, but he won't, he won't buy any factory bought me and you want, he says, I don't want to participate in that system. He's like, you don't have to, you can get organic eggs. There's nothing wrong with those eggs and you can get your protein from that. He just won't, he won't participate in the cheeseburger system. He won't participate in the factory farming system. And it's, it's basically the broad spectrum of human behavior, the fact that we can be almost saintly and beautiful and people can pick people up off the side of the road and, and help them along their way.

Speaker 5:          01:08:22       And then on the other hand, we could be the type of person that stuff's a thousand chickens and do a fucking 10 foot square room and has them stacked on top of each other, shitting on each other's heads and then just pull them out and cut their heads off. And you know they can't walk because we've engineered them to have these gigantic fucking breasts within a, you know, a year of being born. I don't think a lot of people know that it's when you turn your wins, when you open your eyes to that, if you're, if again it comes back to there's the truth, how much you want to delve into it. As soon as it gets scary, people tuck tail and run. But it's just we've got to figure out what the fuck makes the difference in the spectrum. What makes a person that goes out of their way not to step on a bug and what makes a person who has zero problem with stuff and a thousand chickens into a fucking closet?

Speaker 5:          01:09:04       Like what? What's the difference between those two individuals and how do you bridge that gap? How do you, how do you make it so that everybody who's walking around like number one, the number one thing that they're thinking of is don't, don't be cruel. Don't be evil and nasty. Don't, don't do something that would ultimately be looked on in Har if it was made public. That's essentially what a lot of factory farming is. It depends what perspective you're exercising and you're exercising. The perspective of person whose objective is to make a lot of money. I know the objective of a, a person whose objective is to understand where their food comes from. Well then most people are not, they're not going to eat factory farmed meats. No question. Yeah. Most people have zero idea how dark the whole situation is. The more I know, the less I, I went to a, um, uh, butchering house, a slaughterhouse I guess, uh, once for a fear factor stunt and dude, when, I mean I'm not a like a fucking woo kind of guy.

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       I think a lot of woo woo stuff is bullshit. But I felt that that place felt sad. You can feel it felt sad, like the air felt sad. Like it was a big pocket of death. My buddy worked for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and he had to go in there. He's a vegetarian. He's, Geez, I guess you'd call them a Vegan at this point. He walked in and he started telling me about hot dogs, but the bags that are collecting the stuff to make hot dogs. I'm like, they're so delicious though. I'm like, I'm like crowd a little mustard. I'm like, I can't imagine that you would do this. She's like, how to do it? Had to go in there. I had to see it. What's the, it was just checking how disgusting it was. That was his job was just go in there and inspect it. I mean whatever their regulations are for the kitten food inspection agency, he was going in and taking a look at their operation and deciding whether or not this was acceptable practices and whatever parameters that he's trying to, you know, determine.

Speaker 5:          01:10:45       So hot dogs are like all like kneecaps. It's pretty gross sticks and assholes and stuff. False ground up together. It's pretty shitty. I can think of tastier things that are less sort of disgusting, but when you get them really good ones, gourmet hot dogs, they suck too. Like when you get like the, those really nice ones that snap when you bite into them. I'm not going to turn around and try to be the guy get sued by the hot dogs in the street as well. That's the last thing I did. Now to those fucking hot dogs in New York, man, those dirty hot dogs is Joey Diaz

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       calls him those just setting up shop on a corner, boiling some water. I watched the guy and I dared him eat five like Toronto dogs like this. I couldn't believe he could do it. I think shortly after we actually put a cracker up to his mouth and open it in weight because we thought maybe a warm would come up because this was not right. There's not a big guy. He pounded those things. Couldn't believe Kobiashi guy. The guy wins those eating contest. He's not a big guy. I had to pay for those hot docs. Well, it's only five hotdogs, dude. He had to pay with this shits and farts. That's actually one has asked, almost felt like in an hour and a half late, clinching it tight like it's his assholes like a marathon runner and the last couple of miles he did from it. Get a pretty legendary story. Not that good.

Speaker 4:          01:11:54       It's not a good story. You Canadians are much more [inaudible], much kinder and what you judged to be a good story. The story is sucked out. A guy who ate hot dogs who gives a fuck. We're so kind. We open pits up, fill it up with whatever you want to call it, if you want to call it water. Everybody does that, right? That's the problem. Yeah. Well especially out in Europe right now and other places, I mean not the UK, they basically they, they enacted standards of care that were so difficult to abide by that it eradicated the entire industry in the UK, in the UK, the UK, and this is what I tried to hope. This is what I tried to get done here too. It's like, listen to dolphin can exist in captivity. If you can't give it a 200 foot pool, it's not economically viable or really probably possible to dig a pit that big.

Speaker 4:          01:12:36       So guess what? If you can't abide by it, you can't have dolphins. This is the aspirations. These were my aspirations. Um, then look at it. It's gonna happen, but I don't want to give up hope. I mean, it should be illegal and we can't really discuss it any further without repeating ourselves over and over and over and over again. The bottom line is they're smart. We should just talk about illegal, my loss. Who should be too, like I right now at the fact that we're talking now. I, it's conceivable that I come home too. I mean, I know I'm going to come home to great deal of really angry worded letters. Um, because of you talking on this podcast. Oh yeah. Oh Man. You should see the shit that goes on now. Who's saying sends you these angry letters? Well, my Lord deals with it, so he doesn't really tell him.

Speaker 4:          01:13:17       He just says these are from the people in the opposition lawyer versus lawyer camp. What do they think? They think that they could just keep doing this and just scare people away. It's trying to make me broke. Yeah, it, I mean, it's working. It cost me like when I get my bills, they're not small. These are like really big scary bills like these or I could, I could have bought half a house at this point, but instead pumping this money into defending against plotting to steal a walrus. I mean, that's a peculiar thing to, to, to defend against, but it doesn't matter what I'm defending against what it did. Is that something they're accusing you of? Oh yeah. Will you actually plotting to steal a walrus? Well, if you and I sat here and said, Oh man, we should steal that walrus. What do you think is that plotting to steal at Walrus?

Speaker 4:          01:13:55       I would say that's potty then maybe I'm guilty. But what they won't be able to produce is a refrigerated, uh, airplane cargo plane, a beach front house in the Arctic for her to live in this and that, like plotting to steal the Walrus is a bit of a stretch. Okay. Um, so you were caught having conversations where you're talking about, no, no, no, not in the least. So based talk about this. Oh, I can talk about this. Absolutely. Okay. I think I can, oh, there's smooshy there. I mean if you want to go, if you want to back things up under that man, how fucked is that picture? That picture Walrus is sitting on a concrete floor with, with her arm through, it's a her right? Yeah. With her arm through a fucking prison cage. That's so dark, man. So the, the story of smooshy is, you know, she come in from like wild caught 18 months of age, 200 pounds.

Speaker 4:          01:14:46       She's this big, he's a big pillow. Beautiful Amy. She's a baby. She's not good. She didn't come in alone. She comes up with some other animals, uh, walruses where they catch on Russia and the Black Sea. So she comes in and we start then now we've got to get blood from and we got to see if these animals are healthy. So the way you do it with an untrained animal, you throw a big net on him, physically jumped, grabbed them, the fet sticks a needle in their vet or train or someone and they go to take the blood out. Well, during this procedure there was another walrus there that we were doing the procedure on and here's smooshy who's, you know, climbing up on the other walrus. It's making things very difficult. He Mat, as you can imagine, these guys are like linebackers. So all I did was I put my hands in front of her face like this and she opened up her nostrils and I, I remember this vividly.

Speaker 4:          01:15:34       She took a big breath. She started to follow me. After that, I started to back up this animal follow me, big eyes staring at me, following me. I've never seen anything like this before. I thought it was like, this is going to be just a onetime thing. She just followed me because this just made her nervous. What had happened at 18 months of age and at that specific time was I had imprinted on her. That's what happens in the wild. You're a mother, Walrus, you shit out a calf that animal's going to tattoo to its brain, your smell, your sight, the sound, everything so that you can be identified in a herd of hundreds. This happened at 18 months of age. So she imprinted on you, just you imprinted on her because she was panicking. I think it has to have been, it was at that moment.

Speaker 4:          01:16:17       And no question because I know what the baby, while this was all going down, and you can imagine the stress of being caught only maybe months before separated from your mother or witnessing your mother die in a harvest of source. Jesus Christ. So this happens. So this animal I imprinted on her, well this is, this is an anomaly. This doesn't happen. This isn't, hey, here's food. We're like best friends now. Great. This is your mind, mommy. That's the relationship we have. It's crazy. Wow. Yeah, that's intense. So then when you start factoring in the fact that she's in the pool with a lot of crazy chlorine values and she's getting chemical burns and everything else. And I'm like, so you almost have a, a paternal relationship with this? Definitely have definitely have a personal hours. Wow, that's crazy. And all because of the fact they're not cleaning the water, she's getting sick.

Speaker 4:          01:17:13       Well there's more to it than that. She come in at 2004 so she's probably 10, a little over 10 years old now. Um, this relationship also turned into, created some problems. It manifested in like physical manifestations of stress. He developed this uncontrollable regurgitating issue where she doesn't keep her fish down. She pukes it up and it's from anxiety, from separation anxiety. I'm fast forwarding a bit from that moment of the imprint to now or, well, it's a prior to now of course. So there was, there was a lot of challenges that, that relationship post. So you try to train well, so I developed this system where the animal consumes fish and thereafter consumed Jello. I would teach her to eat the Gel and play with the Jello. So try to keep her from throwing up the, the nutrients that are keeping her from gaining weight and being healthy.

Speaker 4:          01:18:07       Right. So I tried to train all the other people on this, you know, tried to wean myself out a number of times. But again, so the relationship was a blessing in the fact that this is, this is amazing, this is crazy. And it was also an more so now like an absolute curse because giving a shit about an animal in that at that level. Like what you're saying that that parental, uh, relationship, that bond, that's tough man. Like to see what she's going through and then you start realizing like, I don't know what I can do to save her because she's going to die.

Speaker 4:          01:18:42       Wow. And she's back there at the same place where you used to work still. I can't be 100% positive. She's still alive right now. I did see a couple of videos in the summer and those videos were tough to watch cause she's still doing the same thing. They don't really use her in the show. She's well hidden in the back. No one sees her. They'll use her in the show sporadically, but it's difficult to use it because all she's doing is looking for me. That's all she ever does. She comes out and she looks for me. Here was this video that come out into summer. Sure. Shit, I'm seeing she's and she's skinnier. Fuck like what? What can I do? There's another thing that's important to remember. When I quit marine Len, we had an understanding I was to remain in this animal's life. I live a football throw away from this facility

Speaker 4:          01:19:37       I gave my two weeks. It's very clear understanding she needs me. Vets have expressed it. Everyone knows it. She needs me. That's the only way we could treat her medically is if I'm there for her to follow me out of the water to go over to do whatever various treatments we were able to do with her on account of that relationship. So we had this understanding and then I was actually called in a couple of days after I had quit to treat a dolphin because it was not a lot of experience that was remaining at the park to deal with this, so the relationship seemed legit. Okay, I can move on as long as I can keep her from dying. I don't want her to die. Right

Speaker 4:          01:20:20       then. Then I had a conversation with a guy, he had worked at marine land for like 30 plus years. He was like, he was up here to me. This guy was one of the nicest men I know and he was like, Phil, you just got to let go. Like you know, just, just take a recess, feeling a lot of anxiety about this whole thing. Then I'd resolved. You know what? I'm going to go. We ended the relationship amicably. Marine Lana die. I'm going to go visit smooshy. It's been a month. The longest I've ever not been in her life since her arrival in 2004 it was 10 days. She lost 30 pounds over that 10 days. This was a month. Now I'm going to see smooshy. So I show up to the park, I get to the security gate to gate that I walked through for 12 years.

Speaker 4:          01:21:04       Every day. No one bats an eye. Of course family here I'm being rejected at the door, like can't come in. And I'm like, what do mean it can't come in? And we have, we have that understanding. We have like I'm still taking care of smooshy. Okay, whatever. So I called my girlfriend who's worked at the time in the park, can you bring you one of my free passes I got to pay to get in? And the owner's son sees me, he grabs me by the shoulders, says no, no Phil, your like family here now you can come in. Well unbenounced to him, there's been some something that happened at the administration administrative end where Phil can't come in. The more it's time to, there was a lot of concern when I quit, but it was not good circumstances. You might let go on a podcast.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       I'm going to get sued for so much more. Nonetheless, I get in and people are really nervous, so I know what's going on. I run back to go see smooshy to the back. I say, I run. That'd be better for the movie. I don't think I ran, but I'm trying to say nonchalant, but walked back like we're smooshy, right? I go see her and she's lying on the pavement. Bone dry Waller says need water in the heat. They need ice. There's no ice and site and she's lost. This has been 30 days that I've been gone. She's lost.

Speaker 1:          01:22:26       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:22:26       Maybe hundreds of pounds. She's really amazing at it. Whoa. I'm looking at this like, are you, how much does she weigh total while she should wait it around 2000 pounds now, but she, at the time she weighed maybe 12 again, she was, she was a smaller animal and difficult to keep the weight on because that regurgitation issue, she was weighing in real thin at this point. I couldn't believe it when I saw her. I'm like, so first thing the vet does go get meds, she'll respond to me. So we give her her appetite, stimulants and antibiotic. Everything else. I'm trying to keep that straight face like, Huh, walk out. Like everything's cool. Right. That night my girlfriend comes home and she's like, you know when you get hurt you don't. When you're hurt, you're hurt by something, but you know what it is so you know that you're in a shitty place.

Speaker 1:          01:23:11       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:23:12       The real pain is when you're hurting so much that you don't know that you're hurting. You're just sort of milling to just sort of off the, you know you're not, you're not in a processing that she come home and she's like, Whoa, what's ups? Nothing's up. Right. Because on a few beers, whatever, wasn't till the next day that I was like, wow, like she might, she's going to die. I have to, I have to come to terms with this reality. This is fucked up.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       That's when the resolve for me said. I was like, fuck it. Use My name, use my face, get the story out. Now if I can get eyes on smooshy, they got to take better care of her. They got to do something. They can't. Not People are going to be paying attention now. That's where it all lies on. Smooshy if I got all eyes on smooshy, they have the cat let her die. But will she just die without you? I mean, if she's imprinted to you and you are her mother, if he, if, if she doesn't see you, will she, will she die without you? That separation anxiety again, I'd only ever been apart from her for 10 days. She lost 30 pounds. This her, that's her. That's an inside edition piece that was done years ago. Normous she's tiny. So that's a tiny walrus right there.

Speaker 4:          01:24:27       Well, even a tiny Waller's is enormous. My God, they're so big. This was a fluff piece that inside edition did look at the size of our mind. God, what a strange animal. And these are all from the Black Sea. She's from the black seat. Yeah. Where else would they live? Walruses um, I dunno, they had them in the Saint Lawrence in Ontario for a long while, but they were hunted out. So I dunno, I unfortunately, I only ever played a bleed, the marine mammal expert in life and he will eat them. Yeah. People eat them. Wow. Walrus. Yeah. Walruses that's so strange, man. The, the whole story is so sad and disheartening. It's so much more elaborate. There's so many little details that continue to go on. Like it's just, so this is her following me. She's calling for me here. So I'm hiding around the corner and you could see she's actually favoring her left flipper.

Speaker 4:          01:25:19       That's where she had the chemical burn. This is just prior to my quitting. Really like just months. But she had a chemical burn on her leg that was so bad. I mean her limp. Yeah. She's limping there because the chemical out, I'll look at that. She follow me anywhere. That animal got to experience a semblance of normality in the sense that I could take her out, walk her anywhere, walk around the park. She got the guilt she has got, she got to go in the snow. Right. These walruses captive. Walrus is such an indoor facilities. They're never going to see the snow unless you bring in the shovel full of snow and it lasts 15 minutes. So is it only Russia that's, that's ganking these animals out of the water right now that I know of. Again, I can't, I can't pretend to be an expert. And it was only ever an expert in pretend world for 12 years while I worked at marine and propagated the messages that I was fed. And now I can

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       admittedly say that I know absolutely very little about animals between black fish and the cove and you know, things that are starting to shed light on the treatment of these animals. How much of an impact do you know how much of an impact that cove has had on the Japanese? There's the heightened awareness, which you, I guess you can measure its impact of course. But politically there's a lot, there's a lot of posturing going on there. Japan wants to say that it's part of their culture. They don't touch that. But there's gotta be some financial gain. There is something, I don't know. I don't want, I can't weigh into that as far as black shit, black shit, black fish and everything here. Like, yeah. That awareness between the star investigation, black fish, everything else. Yeah. People are starting to give a shit now. Granted, it's nice to, it's nice to experience in the high levels of, you know, hey, we're riding the high, I'm on the Joe Rogan show.

Speaker 5:          01:26:52       This is great. Hey, people are contributing to my Indiegogo fund. Hey, that's great. Like we're going to get through this thing. There's a lot of Shitty freaking lows. So this black fish one you want to say, this is going to make for changes. Everything's going to be eradicated. Sea World's done. Look, problem solved. It ain't that easy in six months. No one's talking about this after it wins. Maybe a fricking Oscar. Who knows? But, and then that's it. I think it'll be out there for quite a while. I think it will be one of those documentaries that gets passed around on Netflix or what have you. As long as it makes its way on the internet and a downloadable form. That's a, that's a pretty disturbing documentary, man. This thing's a right hook. I mean just like the star investigation and realize it's a right hook so you know that it's going to have some sustained like influence and change some power.

Speaker 5:          01:27:34       There's enough of this going on right now that I think that people are, they're going to have to come to grips. You know, I, I was hoping that about factory farming too and I still am for the future. I think there's got to be come a point in time where there's so much information out there that we can get ahold of in relation to like how our food is being raised, how animals are being treated and how, again, the animals that don't even want to talk about is animals. The, these, these marine wizards, he's Org orcas and dolphins. There's something different. They're not just a regular animal. There's some weird superintelligent thing. I think you'd find the same with a lot of animals that were slaughtering and in slaughter houses too. But again, I don't want to pretend that I'm an XP and cows and takes, especially if they're really smart, really intelligent pigs, eat people, you know, a guy got whacked off and not whacked off, whacked out.

Speaker 5:          01:28:21       What is it called? [inaudible] and a Cecily. Um, uh, in, in somewhere in Italy. I don't know if was Sicily, but they uh, they threw him in a fucking pen. The pigs ate him alive. So it happened on a western Canada. Same thing. They found a farm and uh, that was in Vancouver, right? A serial killer that was throwing the hookers to the pigs, feeding them, you know. Yeah. They had to find like little pieces of this and pieces of that and like, hmm. They're thorough when they eat. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't mean you've got to turn around to hate him and like pound Bacon. The Bacon Sandwich big is delicious. You don't, Higgs are not going to live forever. I haven't eaten bacon a long time. Picon was definitely the thing that I wanted to wrap everything in Canada. I did. I backed, I wrapped ice cream. Bacon. That's delicious.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       Try it. I was curing bacon wrapped. I took an Eggo waffle. I put, I suppose you don't have to, it doesn't have to be an Eggo waffle and they put a waffle down. I put a ice cream bacon, another waffle. This, this is when I do know what you're doing by this story by not being a fat guy. You fat shaming. Oh Shit. Here we go. That's what I feel. I feel he's fat shaming by being able to say this, I can eat this. What about you? You fat fuck with his shitty metabolism. Just put one slice of Bacon instead of the eight I put and then put and I put the Maple Syrup, you know, and then I put a little, I can't remember like whip cream or something like pounding the same. I'm like, wow, bacon an ice cream. But now you're done no more.

Speaker 4:          01:29:38       You can just Guinea pigs because they're intelligent. Once you see what's going on there, you can't unsee it. You can pretend to unseat, but at night it reminds you, well, especially pigs that are in captivity, they're so sweet. Pigs in captivity are like really gentle souls. Pigs are strange animals, man. They, you know, I recently found out that pigs and wild boars are essentially the same animal, the exact same animal according to this guy, Steve Rinella, who knows a lot more about animals and I ever will. But he was saying that it's just, we don't know what that is. Yeah. What is it? I've heard that before. It's off. It's a funding page. It's the video. This one is not difficult to watch. It might be worth the watch though. But what I was saying is that pigs like wild pigs and domestic pigs are essentially the same animal.

Speaker 4:          01:30:26       And one of the weirdest things about pigs is when you take a pig, a domestic pig, when they're released into the wild, within three weeks, they start to morph. They started to physically change. Their tusks grow longer. Their nose, their snout grows along with their hair changes. It gets thicker and courser they did not come within three weeks. They start the metamorphosis and then become like wild boars starts to bother me when the conversation comes in. And the scientists, at least those that are sponsored by a bus or they're paid for by big money start saying, oh, it's really difficult. You can't re amalgamate an animal with its family. Can't put an of back in the wild. They're used to this. It can't do it. Listen, Orca is a kinetic, amazing machine. Well, here's the real question. How have they ever tried? They did try.

Speaker 4:          01:31:08       They tried with Keiko, uh, free Willy Orca and it was successful. This animal was taken into a sea pen and then it was eventually off on its own and it lived for a long time and he would forge for food. He interacted with other orcas. He got intimidated by those orchids. I mean it was probably a little bit of a lonely journey, but you've got to learn a great deal of, of his life in the wild is reintegration. And it was, it was a glaring success. He did eventually die. Uh, but nonetheless, I mean on all or, cause eventually they all die. A lot of, a lot of people like your your see will. People are going to be like, well he died. He died over there. Well, how long did he live? I can't remember exactly. Again, I can't, I can't pretend to be an expert. I read this, I'll propagate this and I'll tell you things, but I don't think it has to do with the longevity of how long you lived there as much as the quality of life, but that does sound like a scapegoat way of saying, well, he died early or

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       soon after buck. The wildest fucking harsh man. It's harsh for everything. Very few animals. You know what I was talking about deer earlier when you, you find a deer that's five years old, that's a fucking old deer. It's very rare that a deer gets to be five years old and it's not just because of hunters. It's because of predators and freezing to death, freezing to death. It's like the number one cause of death for a mule. Deer deer that live in Montana, they fucking freeze to death, man. Before the coyotes get them, before anything happens, like shit, it's cold as fuck and they're not going to make it so they have to fuck like crazy and shoot as many of them out there as possible and hopefully a couple of them will make it to next year and then they fucked like crazy and keep going.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       That's the only way or cause or different man they like. I would, I would imagine the ocean to be a pure utopia. Pure and imagining, right. I mean especially if they're in like Alaska, they're the top somewhere. They're top cheese. They don't worry about anything. They had dolphins that's lead anything. They do kill dolphins. It's Kinda fucked up. Fuck the ORCAS. They killed dolphins, but it's kind of fucked up. I mean it's really kind of, that's one, one of the weird things about life is that it's the, one of the major reasons why even Stephen Hawking's has said that if there were some sort of an alien invasion from an intelligent species from another galaxy or what have you, we really should be concerned because if we just look at the way we treat animals that are lesser than us, that we can control and look at the way every other animal from chimpanzees to monkeys to everything finds things in.

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       Either fucks it or eats it. Everything's slower, are dumber than it. It put it in prisons. It fucks or at eats and that's what we've done. That's what chimpanzees do. That's what dolphins do. Dolphins kill baby dolphins on a regular basis? I don't know about that. They do. They do come on the males, the males try to displace the cast for the females. They get a pregnant yet super common. Right? They're really horny though. These are like peak times and Horniness, right? It's okay to kill babies. There's a, there's a brief period where they're like, well I mean or cause in captivity are banging their daughters. Right. That's that peak of of Supreme Horny. This we don't know. That's a big difference between that we're talking about in the wild. That's one of the reasons why female dolphin promiscuity is so at such a high rate.

Speaker 2:          01:34:09       I think we have to get worried if a orchids grow legs because they're the ones that are going on motherfuckers for sure. I'm sure. Right? Fingers and legs. They figured out how to wait to get out of the water. We're done. My God. Hopefully I'm on their good side. Smart. An enormous, if they could live in Seattle where it rains all the time. Just run through the streets every time it was a rainstorm. You got to bolt on your doors. She's orchids are going to be running through the streets looking to fuck people up or cause they're nice though. I think that you could probably like it's the new shark Nedo like the new Godzilla like baby Godzilla or go running. Yeah. Every time it's raining everybody has a fucking bolt or door down. Cause orkis they only need like six inches of water and they start running. They just need to be wet. They don't even need a new water. They just need to be wet. They did develop pause on their arm, stretch out. They just go into cocoons and then they pop out with arms and legs. It's better learn how to do back flips for whatever you like to.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       Yeah, but we have gun and shit. I think it would be a slaughter. They'd run down the street. We just tagging them off, but how many of them are, they're really, we don't know what's common bringing it bitch, we don't know and the depths of the ocean. They, we got jet son, we've got jets, we can fly. We can fly and shoot hellfire missiles down at town. They're working on a factory down there to come bring it, come bring it a mental fuck us the whole time. Then all of a sudden we're like putting guns on ourselves. Probably are by being super sweet. That's how they're mentally fucking us by making us look like what piece of shits we really are. I'll give a shit now they're onto something. They know what they're doing. Yeah. Well I think, you know, as we said before, I think that the more the information gets out, the more the reality of the situation becomes into focus and not just for the protected few that knew before but couldn't do anything because you were financially beholden to the one person or people that own whatever organization contains these animals and imprisons them.

Speaker 5:          01:35:50       And the reality of the situation as it becomes more and more aware to you, you know, as you go from being this kid who's like got this great idea, like, wow, I can't believe I'm here. Hold on up. Killer whales TV. What a dream. Two years later, like, Holy Shit, I'm a part of an animal prison or not even an animal. I'm a part of an intelligent things prison. I can't feel a lot of guilt for being there. I didn't pluck them out of the ocean, so I feel like maybe, maybe I'm atoning for that guilt of like shit man, but doing a really good job in, in the facility and trying to care for the animals. It's hard to feel guilt for doing that. I don't think you should feel guilt. I don't think guilt any good. Right. I mean the people that are part of something or the ones that are paying at the gate, that's what needs to stop.

Speaker 5:          01:36:35       Yes. The only thing that guilt helps it. Guilt helps you realize you're doing something wrong, getting a bad feeling, you realize you're doing something wrong and hopefully correct it. That's the only thing that guilt really does. Other than that, you know you haven't guilt for working there, especially coming into it. No, not knowing. Being a young guy who had these idealistic visions of what it was like to work at a marine animals facility and trained killer whales and Shit and then you get there and you realize the reality of it. Like that's just a part of, you know, you realizing the world is complicated. It's just, that's your version of it. The overwhelming guilt was that I'm not doing anything to stop this. It wasn't an participating in this. It's I got to do something. Who's going to do something? I was going to do something.

Speaker 5:          01:37:18       Okay, fuck it. Use My name, use my face Sumi for millions. Get my girlfriend fired. We're going to live in cardboard boxes student. Great. Did you, what's like when you went into this, what was like, what's the worst case scenario? If you want, you just think about it. Do you just think about it? Like, did you like say, okay, what's the worst that this can do to me? What you wind up in jail when you wind up in prison where you wind up in debt, obviously. I wonder, yeah, I guess the anxiety was like subside of the great deal once the resolve was there, but that was only because I saw smooshing like take that out of the equation. I don't know that necessarily. I would have at least had as as much a hand in like allowing myself to, you know, be a part of investigation.

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       He uses the name and face of course, but that, that guilt and everything else that fog, you don't think rationally like, well maybe I should just back away and not try to, to change the status quo because hey, this could be at great risk. I mean, of course, you know, you're going to take a shit kicking, you know, you know, you know there's going to be a recourse. I don't care. I don't want smooshy to die. Right. You know, you've gotta put yourself in their shoes. It's like, what are you willing to do for this animal? And I hate to call it animal, but this, this being that you share this bond with, what do you, what lengths are you willing to go? I decided I'm willing to stick my neck out. Well, that's very admirable, man. It really is. You know, the, the whole mean you, you're doing what the hero does and the story, right?

Speaker 5:          01:38:41       And confronted with an inescapable truth. You Act and uh, you know, and especially emotionally in your case, you being so attached to this one animal, you know, literally it's mom to it. That's gotta be a really strange time, you know, to know that you're right and know that your instincts are correct and you're acting on the best interest of the animal, but it facing this intense amount of opposition. It's mean, it's classic hero story. I mean, I'm just trying to get the happy ending, man. You're obviously the good guy, good guy, and every one of those stories. I mean in that classic story, you're obviously the good guy. I don't know whether, I mean you might be crazy. You might've made most of this up. No fun up there. I've done that. [inaudible] telling me the shit. We're going to play the video man, relax this, this pacing man, he got, it's, this is an art to this as this is Hollywood man.

Speaker 5:          01:39:31       I would've, I know Hollywood. This is fucking Canoga Park sons is nowhere near Hollywood. It's a long ways from Chippewa and Niagara Falls. Well because it's warm out. It's just a bunch of people. Dude, you Canadians kind of get over that shit. Scary place. The states man and that, I mean all of a sudden you come in and you guys got like big roads and stuff. Is that what it is? That big roads coming out? Big Role. Our books and big word cards are shiny. They're not rusty either. It's amazing. I'm looking around going, wait, where's the rust? Because you're used to people that are traveling around with salt. I had a jeep ratchet that, yeah, when I lived in Boston, every car had fucking big rust holes and the quarter panels he could poke your finger through right where the wheel went. Yeah. Yeah. Don't be cheap if you're in a, if you're in Canada.

Speaker 5:          01:40:11       And what was the thing that I heard about jeeps recently? There was some sort of a, an issue about recalls that, did you hear about this? I didn't know. I was lucky to sell mine. Actually. I, I made a deal with a guy, he was like three k certified. I'm like, yeah, no problem. I look at certified for sure. I'd take it to the shop guys like k hole here, a whole here, this, that 4,000 of fixed. I'm like, Oh man, I'm in deep shit. And there there's a fuel tank. Recall for jeeps, Bentleys, Lamborghinis and Nissans. Oh, this is like, they're all being made by the same place. Um, no, no, obviously not. Right. Well, this is what's confusing. The recall, widespread recall jeeps to Lamborghini's. So serious range. Maybe they it was the same tank or something like that. I mean the type of tank I could see you don't need

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       like a high end tank to be in a Lamborghini, although it would be a very different shape. You know, the different shapes for different calls or just somebody who had brought this up and I wasn't aware of it. Some sort of a recall. Icer says the trailer hitches will protect the gas tanks which are mounted behind the rear axle and are vulnerable to rear impacts. Although Kreisler told the agency that a trailer hitch cannot and will not mitigate the risk of high energy rear car collisions, but would incrementally improve the performance in certain types of low speed impacts. Boy, that doesn't make me feel comfortable. The most hilarious shit. Those those Teslas, you know those Tesla ss, one of the drivers is like a big dolphin. A advocate. What? Ilan Musk the guy because she's a woman. Laelani Mun Munter there's a lot of people that own them now.

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       They're pretty common, but they've had three of them burst into flames. I heard about that. Yeah, I apparently, I mean it's a brilliant car. It's one, many car. The years it's like environmentally friendly. Well sort of. Well that's the, I think they're pushing that sort of sort of here's the issue. They're all this conflict minerals in every lithium ion battery when you're getting lithium ion batteries, if, unless you absolutely are completely sure of where that lithium was sourced. You're getting lithium from Afghanistan, you're getting lithium from the Congo, you're getting lithium from some really dark places where there's a lot of people that are running the show that are cunts and when you know when you, it's one of the things about cell phones, one of the darkest things about computers, the very minerals that are used to run your computer and your cell phones, those are being pulled out of the ground in certain places by essentially slaves.

Speaker 2:          01:42:27       They're being pulled out by little kids in some way. I mean maybe they've cleaned that up in some places because this stuff has been exposed, but the Congo is notorious for being like a really terrible place when it comes to human rights. Vice magazine has done several pieces on the Congo and you know how it, how it runs down there. Like I saw like tourism piece of vice magazine actually placed magazine wrote an article on marina and that still is the best damn article. I mean they're the shit man. Oh yeah, they're awesome. Oh, by the way, I had Eddie Wong and Shane Smith or coming back on together on the 18th. It's going to be a party in here and were told to bring booze. So I don't see what happens. But Eddie Wong and Shane Smith together, Shit could be epic. Yeah. They'd go everywhere and expose everything.

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       And you know what's beautiful about vices that they have. Here's another one. This is my favorite one though. The electric cars, uh, they, the Fisker Karma, those Fisker, you know, those things are, those are those really beautiful ones. They have a solar panel on the roof, so the solar panel actually charges up your radio and uh, like your dashboard and you're displaying everything like that. It's like a supplemental charge. Sure. Like, well, well they're really cool looking car, but they, uh, they park them on the docks and during the hurricane they fucking burst into flames when they got wet. I serious. Yes, yes. Yeah. They fucking burst into flames, man. You'd have that at least that tested like, well, how was it when it's wet? Yeah. I don't know. That's not good though. Like what happened to that Porsche? You know, the one that Brian or that guy from the movies died in?

Speaker 2:          01:44:03       Oh, the Carrera Gt Paul Walker died and that's a very dangerous car, isn't it? Yeah, it's a slippery car. Um, Walter Role, who is a world famous race car driver, like he's been the, the, the head test driver for Porsche forever. You could see Walter role. Um, you could see his, uh, his videos of him driving all over youtube. The guys who's super talented and incredibly good at driving race cars. And he got out of the career gt and he was like, that car scared me. This is a scary car. Too much power, too weird with its handling. I mean, it's a mid engine car. It's very dynamic, incredibly powerful. 500 horsepower, very, very light. And uh, he felt like at the limit he couldn't figure out, but he said they, they drove it in the wet one of the first times he drove it and he was terrified.

Speaker 2:          01:44:53       He said that the button, the car needed two buttons, one for the wet and one for the dry. There's been quite a few accidents in that car and including Jay Leno spun his out at Talladega. He has a, he has a Carrera gt, he has like, you know, a hundred fucking cars, but he had this Carerra gt spin out on him. Jay Leno knows how to drive fucking cars tire well as, as this guy who was driving the car that Paul Walker died and the guy was a race car driver. He wasn't just like a regular slow, he really knew how to drive cars. So I think it's one of those cars, it's just super powerful and like you have to really mind it. You have to be really careful of it. There's, you know, there's certain cars that they probably shouldn't exist. Like the Mustang has a car out now, Shelby gt 500 it has 670 fucking horsepower.

Speaker 2:          01:45:42       It's insane and I don't even think it has 11 inch wide tires. I mean they're not that wide and this fucking thing. I had the GT 500 from the previous years. It had 550 horsepower. It was ridiculous. I couldn't imagine that someone had that thing and said, do you know what? This fucking thing needs another hundred and 10 120 horsepower. See the problem I have with these cars and these these bikes is like if you could like change the unused horsepower though is probably you'll never use into like value these vehicles that are priced way. The hell up here. I really only worth like you could pay 12,000 bucks for a Mustang because the rest of the power that you'll never be able to use or explore doesn't exist. Like take it out of the equation, you know? Yeah. But who the fuck things like that. That's one of the cool things about those cars is that you have that power son.

Speaker 2:          01:46:31       Yes, you can. You get on the onramp, you accelerate to 60 miles an hour legally in three seconds. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's legal. Okay, so within those three seconds then there's value, but there's still so much unused potential. They're fun. You're thinking like an accountant and that's not what these cars are all about. Especially cars. Muscle cars are all about emotion. It's all about the sound of the rumble of the engine. Even if you're not going fast, like if you buy an old muscle car that those things are terrible. They drive like shit. They fucking handle horrible. Every corner you go around, there's no aerodynamics. The breaks are dog shit. Unless you upgrade everything to modern standards, you're dealing with a fucking disaster. But it'll put a big fat, stupid smile on your face when you drive one of the stuff. But these crotch rockets though, I mean your first gear, you're a half twist on the wrist and you're, you're already like, don't go through a school zone him.

Speaker 2:          01:47:18       He came and start this thing through a school zone without giving up on the back tire. Well, yeah, I mean they're ridiculous. The amount of power is ridiculous. Nobody needs it, but people like it. They like it. You know, California, it's even scarier. The bikes are even scarier than the cars because they're so light. It's such a small object that's hurling. I remember going through a school zone and it's like, I'm just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. On one of these I've Katherine, it was like a six or 900 something. One of them up, up, up. I looked down, it's like 70 clicks, kilometers an hour in Canada. Holy Shit. Like at least my license. If I'm caught doing this, I'm just going bump. I'm trying to be as nice as possible. Yeah. They're so fast and you're so tuned in. When you drive something that's that fast all the time. He's so tuned in to speed. You know? You're so tuned into that. All that crazy shit car becomes, it becomes when it becomes an extension of your body once you're in the zone. Right. You gotta know your shit though. Is that Jay Leno spinning out? Did he hit the wall? No, it looks, it looks like he hit something man, right? Yeah, he hit me. Holy Shit.

Speaker 8:          01:48:16       Yeah. Those are what caused the splitter. This,

Speaker 2:          01:48:24       they're fucking tricky cars, man. Just like that. Just let it go. Just let go. He was obviously turning. You can see he's turning,

Speaker 8:          01:48:30       it'll hit the wall

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       when you drive in a car like that, he's okay. He didn't hit the walls. That would have said no, I guess. No, I guess it, it's a half a million dollar car too, by the way. I say they're probably worried about the car too. Right? Well, when you're driving a car like that, the, the amount of traction that you have, there's so much power and you're dealing with the tires have to keep up with what the engine can do. Makes sense and you have to mitigate that. You have to be able to balance that out in a good race. Car driver knows where the limits of the tires are and also when you get onto a track, the tires aren't at their peak immediately. You might need five, six laps warm to warm up the tires so you get to get to the temperature of the tires is very critical to performance.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       Especially when you're dealing with like cop tires and these fat slicks that a lot of these race car drivers drive around on. So the whole deal is about putting heat into those tires and until you have that or if the conditions are bad or if it's rained within the last 48 hours, all those have big factors on the amount of traction that you have on that, not to think about and getting behind it. That's nice. Nice thing about the jeep. It's just bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup. Mean. Obviously we were just talking about race cars. Most cars, these things don't come into factor, but what does come into play is that the lessons learned from these cars, these cars going really fast around race tracks. People think it's ridiculous, but why would you need that? Why do you, you don't, you're right, absolutely shits and giggles.

Speaker 2:          01:49:51       This sport, it's for shits and giggles. It's a hobby. It's a pastime. But the lessons learned from these races are exactly why today's cars are so safe that today's cars handles so well. They're so aerodynamically sound there. There, there are zero to 60 times have dropped steadily every year. It's all because of the improvements that they made because the motor sports, like if you look at like Porsche has um, they have a Panamera, you know what that is? They have a four door car, they have a big, it's like a big like Mercedes looking thing, big spaceship looking thing. I've seen like the, I've seen like the, they've got to almost an SUV. Look at Porsche, that's a Cayenne. They have those cars that they have now. They fucking defy physics. These things are insane. When you drive one of them, the engineering involved in these 500 plus horsepower, twin turbo, 5,000 pound vehicles or whatever the fuck they way it's well over 4,000 pounds.

Speaker 2:          01:50:44       It's, it's shocking when you drive, you can't believe how they handle all that's from motor sports. All that's from the lessons they learned in engineering and trying things out, doing things like, you know, like 24 hour races, the little Oman's races and all the gt races that Porsche gets involved in. They learn all that. They learn from those mistakes. And how to improve those fast cars and then the apply those lessons to their regular cars, their consumer cars, and they also apply it more so or at least a great deal on the shits and giggles factor because that's what, that's where they're getting off. I mean, making these things big. It doesn't address a lot of people's like I'm never going to drive one of these things. Yeah, it's awesome that that guy could, I can't drive that. Well, they're getting, they're getting a Nunes insane levels.

Speaker 2:          01:51:26       Why don't just put wings on these things. They're flying. They can't, that's not legal yet, but when you get into, when you start talking about like a performance levels like zero to 60 levels, like just 10 20 years ago, if you get a car to zero to 60 in four seconds would be crazy. Like wow, zero to 60 in four seconds. You could get that in a Mustang gt. It costs 35 grand. I mean a regular car that you buy can Mustang gt almost a zero to 60 in four seconds. It might be like four or five at the most, half a second slower. It's crazy. The performance. They've got a [inaudible], a Porsche, um, uh, the turbo s the nine 11 turbo s the new one goes zero to 60 in 2.7 seconds. Where do you have to be in to take 2.7 seconds to get, I mean, that's great for fireman.

Speaker 2:          01:52:11       I don't want to say police necessarily, but you can't, obviously it's tough to get fire gear in a Porsche nine 11, but what's going to be, what's going to happen in a hundred years from now? Is it going to be zero to 60 instantly? Are we going to like warp thread? It's going to be at different means of transportation altogether. Really? Look what, yeah. Wormholes. Like you say, I dunno what transponders with the Pipi gone. Yeah. I guess if we never saw the internet coming, we're not going to see the next thing coming either. You know, evolution, everything's evolving. Where I'm holes in your car, you're going to press a button, you're going to show up in the office right now. The fastest way to get somewhere to keep shit at though all

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       got to work from home now boom, so you have a 60 I think the fact that you could send files through the mail, through email, you could send files through online. Drones are now going to start dropping shit off. You're not going to have to go to that many places anymore. I think actually physically going places. I think we're going to be trapped at home looking at monitors all day, talking to each other, face to face through these things. Can 99% of my friends already. Where do you think this, this whole controversy and lawsuit, where do you think this takes you? Do you, do you have like an end game here? Do you have like a an escape clause? Do you have like a way that you can so get out of this, it's a slap suit to strategic lawsuit against public participation. The idea is he launches the suit.

Speaker 4:          01:53:27       I shut the hell up. The suit goes nowhere. He had their backs at the hell off or he bleeds me dry phone. I got, I'm out of funds. I don't get a choice in the matter. I signed a piece of paper saying, I'm not going to bother you in more. I'm never going to talk. And if somebody wants to Google your whatever it is to Gogo, what does it save? smooshy.com save smooshy.com so I'll smooshy you should probably smell smoke a s M o. O. S. H. I. So this is the fourth campaign that we've, that I've launched. I've basically raised about $40,000 and then there was that Billy challenge that I think you spoke to Les Stroud a boat. Yes. Less speaks very highly of you, which is why you're here. Thanks les. Les is a great guy and he's, he's an awesome guy. He's my homeboy last one.

Speaker 4:          01:54:10       A long ways to try to help us. We won through less. We won $32,000 Canadian one day. I'm sitting there talking about initiating payment with the guy like, okay, we're flying this guy or this guy guy's being flown down. We're going to have a big presentation. Less is going to be there because you know, les was the celebrity that was sponsored to our charity and then a week later I'm reading that this Billy challenge his belly up and simple as that, but by no money, what? Like 32,000 bucks. I'm trying to support three lawsuits right now. Mine, my girlfriend, I'm confused. What happened? They disappeared. They don't exist. There's a website, the [inaudible] dot com you hit it. They've suspended operation. We're not getting paid. Oh, so they quit. They went under. They bailed in there. Something happened. Okay. We don't know what, but I tell you, that's a shitty day when you wake up.

Speaker 4:          01:54:57       I mean the emotion where you're like, shit, we're being supported big time. We just went $32,000 that's going to see me till next summer. Beautiful. Because the longer I can sustain this battle in these lawsuits, especially with the counter suits, there comes a point where the, with the power swings, he's trying to, they're trying to beat the snot out of us in every which way they can using money. If we have that money and we last so long, suddenly they have to start disclosing files in our lawsuits that they do not want to disclose. The objective is bleed 'em dry, drop the suit. They've done it this historically. That's the, that's the function of a slap suit. If I got the monies and I get so far, oh, oh, black fish, the movie, everything that was revealed in there was from the Osha versus seaworld, uh, trials.

Speaker 4:          01:55:42       All the stuff that see had to give, they have to provide video of orcas beating the snot out of trainers. Uh, you know, a bunch of all these things come out. It's the same thing with, with the, with marine land, they're going to have to open up files about the killer whales health. They're going to have to open up files and what a lot of things exonerating us. They're gonna have to show the water log histories, the, the newspaper. It has that. But nonetheless, they're going to have to disclose these things. They don't want to do that. Their objective is sue the shit out of us. Make us broke. Drop the suit. Go. That was the way of the nineties eighties seventies whatever. It's a new day and age. Suddenly there's a Streisand effect. You Sue me to shut me up, blows up the whole thing. It blows it right up.

Speaker 4:          01:56:18       Everyone's listening. People give a shit. I wind up getting enough money to see this thing through. He can't drop it. I got the counter suit while let's start opening books. You want to see, you want to have a look inside. Let's start opening books, you know, and it doesn't. Opening financial books, finding out how many profiting, medical records, water log history, how did, how much did you pay for those dolphins? Let's find out like whatever. I mean, there's a bunch of things that apply to the losses, but moreover there's also the question of, Hey, if you're a person that's going to turn around and say, I don't think animal abuse is cool and you wind up being sued, made, broke, wiped out, that's not a good precedence to send for people out there. It's not good for the human race. It's not good. It's precisely at, this is less about, I mean it's about animals primarily. Initially, this is social, social justice.

Speaker 2:          01:57:01       So what you're essentially doing is reaching more people than the people who have influenced, can reach with their money and their influence. They've collected a bunch of people that are controlling the regulations and enforcing the laws and they figured out a way to keep these people under their wing. But what you're doing by getting on this podcast, by starting your India Gogo count and fucking being one of the Gogo girls or whatever, what you're doing is spreading that passed their reach of control. He's got money. They only have a little bit of money though. They don't have that much money. How much money is, yeah, he's got a billion. He's got to have a lot more than me. This is a fucking 300 million people in this country. If you get $1 million of those people find out I sleep. How much money does he have? Really? And by the way, if you start fucking organizing a boycott of his property, that money goes away ultra fast. While the numbers are down bad, they fucking should be, man. It's a prison colony

Speaker 4:          01:57:51       at the monies. I sleep easy. Again. I took this thing on. This wasn't, hey, for the next 80 hours, every fucking week you're going to go petition the shit out of trying to get people's money. That sucks. Asking for people for money really sucks. What the hell else am I supposed to do? I've been pinned. I've been backed into a corner. I'm coming out swinging. I got to do what I can. It seems to be working. We're getting somewhere that anti slap legislation that was announced in Ontario that's coming. If that aunt anti slap comes sooner than later, we're in a race right now like anti slap, meaning that it stops these kinds of legal lawsuits that's happening. I think it's in it's second reading and Ontario legislation like, and this is all because of the lawsuits that were, that were launched against us. There's, there's a lot of attention, so suddenly they're getting nervous, so they're really pushing this agenda.

Speaker 4:          01:58:34       They're trying to, they're trying to get me to pony up for this motion to strike out everything. In our defense. Everything in our counterclaim lawyers are us. 15,000 bucks a pop. I got three lawyers. I'm trying to support mine, my case, my girlfriends and this nice man who worked for 12 years who spoke about the time the owner shot two pets, golden retrievers on his, on his, uh, on his property and marina property. They went and sued him for telling them, wait a minute, wait a minute. What did he do? It's deep. He allegedly, I was there that day. I can attest that a lot of things that happened, these dogs come running in these two pets. Golden retrievers, golden labs, golden retrievers. Well he doesn't want them there to more. They're running up and down the fence there bothering the deer. He shot the day here. Two shots. I come in to work. Someone's out there doing his thing. Phone rings. What's this guys name? John Holder. He's the one who shot these two golden retrievers allegedly. Whoa. So the guy who was very brave to say that and have other stories where he had to do some really had them do some really tough things is being sued as well. Whose dogs with these? The neighbors. One of the low, one of like two houses down, so the dog's just got out of the yard or something like that out of the yard. Barking started into the parking lot because the right across the street is the deer park. Gates Open. Dogs start in Shit. My dogs are gone.

Speaker 4:          01:59:58       Boom, boom. There's witnesses. Whoa. Well had these dogs at tag the deer where they just, oh well. I mean, I don't know. I wasn't there for that, but nonetheless, I mean, fuck you, don't you don't you just call the Osp, say come get these fucking dogs. The labs. You come grab me, go, come here buddy. They're the sweetest dogs on earth. Told you off the hop. Don't try to rationalize his thinking. Everything. It's a good idea is a bad dude. Golden labs are just the sweetest dogs ever. I've never met a single mean one in my life. That stories out there. The videos are a shitty poodles. Every golden lab I met wants to give you a kiss when you get close to it. Those things are gems there. They're beautiful dogs. That star investigation, if you go to this, the Toronto Star website and just look up Marineland, there's probably three dozen stories and that's in there.

Speaker 4:          02:00:38       Yeah, boom. He's how never get that web. Well, that's harsh shot neighbor's dogs. Yeah. Wow. Oh my God. I heard these stories. There's, there's a shit ton and it wasn't just the three of us that are being sued. It's a bunch of people. He's suing an activist for one point $5 million. This guy come out of nowhere. There's the dog. So that was the dogs. Oh my God. There's actually video of the dog. Very playful, beautiful freaking dogs. Their fucking pants. Well now they're dirt. Oh God. What an asshole. So what happened out of this? But he got sued. Yeah, but he's getting sued. Who's getting sued? So the night I was out of pocket $5,000 someone's going to retain a lawyer for this man. Who's going to do it. I'm looking around and shit. I buddy, you're talking not talking about it on whole or you're talking about your friend who got in trouble for this? Talking about the guy who right, who came out about this and then started to sleep easy at night. Decided to say look, cause he, he quit about six months before I did amidst really, I mean if you think the marine mammals got it tough, you should see the land animals at this place. It's real tough. Some really shitty things going on.

Speaker 2:          02:01:39       What do you mean land animals? Marine land has landed on his own. It's own entity, man. They have bears. What? Oh yeah, they have bears should read about the bears. That's a shitty story. I fucking hate bear captivity man. There's a video, Brian, I want you to pull this up. Bear kills man. And like eight seconds. There's a video that I, I refer to whenever anybody talks to me about bears being trained and people training bears and pull up the video. Brian have a bear, a kills man and fucking seven seconds or whatever it was. It was the bear from a movie. I forgot the move. I want to say the longest shot, but it wasn't the longest yard. It was like first and Tan or some fucking football movie or something like that. There was a bear in that movie. A trained bear is Baird worked in Hollywood and films and TV shows, his cousin or brother or something.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       He's having the guy stand there while he's trained. The bear cause happens for real and the bear just attacks the guy out of nowhere for no reason. He's a barrier. Just exactly launches. It's out. This is it right here. This is terrible. I can tell you right now, looking at that bear, I can tell you this. Trouble brewing. The guy's standing there and he's just doing nothing and the bear just decides to fuck him up and that's it. It should turn away. Turn away, Brian. I want to see him. Shit. That's the end. He ripped the guys, throw it out. The guy was dead in seconds. You can't fuck with bears, man. They do what? They want. Their bears. Same as killer whales, man. Same as any animal there. They're wild. It's not a golden lab. A golden lab is not a wild animal by any stretch of the imagination.

Speaker 4:          02:03:11       Two shotgun shots all took man. That the details in those stories. Uh, you know, when Jim quit, I was the day that those, uh, those, those dogs got shot. I actually got pissed at Jim because I was in the office with the vet. The vet gets a call. She's like, what? Oh my God. Puts the phone down. She like, fuck the owner of just shot two retrievers are golden last. I'm like, fuck. They're like, well, you know, Jim wanted to do this, but he didn't. I was like, fuck man. I was pissed at gym. In my mind, I'm like, Jim, quit. Surely after Jim was in a real tough spot. Jim Speaks brave as hell. Man, I'm so proud of this man. He's the nicest, gentle man you've ever met. Boom. He slapped to the fucking lawsuit. So while, who's going to pony up? I was out of pocket.

Speaker 4:          02:03:53       I start fundraising out of pockets are fundraising, but that's the idea. They keep launching suits. We can't keep up, but at some point, man can't keep launching them. Ontario govern paid attention. Can't do it. No more anti slap legislation. It's coming. But we're in a race. We're in a race because they're pushing these different things. There's an activist, as I was saying, and his name's Mike Garrett. He was, he read the star articles in the newspaper about everything that's going on. He's like, what the fuck starts holding the sign up there. Danny brings out a bull horn. Then he starts interacting with the owners. It's a video there. That's amazing. You want to see the owner of marine land? He uh, he starts like, he's actually threatened to stab the guy on video, which is crazy. And the fucking Susan, he sues him for a bunch of Shit.

Speaker 4:          02:04:30       That never happened. It's all bullshit. It's a slap suit. It's just, hey, if you keep talking and telling the truth about us, we're going to sue you to shut you up. Well, that's, now that's more so what I'm advocating for, this is a social justice issue. Now, you know, so I keep making a stink, but at the end of the line, there's always smooshy. I still have dreams, man. I still want to see what that animal, I know what she's going through. Of course I need to see her. So is this what's turning you into a vegetarian? No, it's, you know what it is? It's so on Twitter. On Facebook. Like people are following me. Right. And they're always, you know, I follow people or I got shit on Facebook and there's always these fricking images and I'm like, ah. Right. It keeps seeing him keep seeing him.

Speaker 4:          02:05:07       He can't, like I said, you can't unsee. You don't, it doesn't take long. You only got to watch 30 seconds of one video would be like off, off. I don't need that no more. That's, that's out. I like cheese. I have a real tough time getting away from cheese, like really old thin slice chai for cheese. They suffer like you would not imagine at the end. They do in the worst ways. Milk, milk. I'm off milk. Wait a minute. But what about natural organic milk where they just go in and milked the cow? I'd have to see it. I'd have to see it to know, but I know the milk that I was drinking and the gallons is done. I'm out. I see what you're saying. So the factory farmed milk, the way they get it on the standard, I don't know what percentage of what you buy at the store, but a great deal of it is cruel at you that you cannot imagine.

Speaker 4:          02:05:48       Ah, dude, why you bumming me out now? Welcome to my world. Every time I log into Facebook, boom, milk cows shitty. Especially now that you're connected to that. Well, all these people have befriended, they're all supporting and they're all doing their costs. You know, I wanna, I wanna help. I wanna see what we were talking about earlier about the broad spectrum of human behavior that people can be kind and sweet and people can be fucking murderous. Cons. There's, there's this spectrum and unfortunately that manifests itself in business as well. And the way we treat animals as far as factory farming and as far as running these marine animal facilities or zoo. Moreover, the, the people that are working at these places, yeah. They got to earn that of course. And not only that, they probably like you went into it with good intentions and along the way realize what it actually was.

Speaker 4:          02:06:32       You start when you, I mean, you got to, you got to pry open that third eye. You've got to sort of get yourself out of the, out of the element itself and look from a different perspective altogether cookie and go to the zoo. Uh, I would definitely advocate for that. Let's play that video and uh, I gotta take a leak. So let's play that video and I'll come back while, so you still have it? No. Why would you? You're going to see the dog video, the video that he was going to play earlier. Oh, this one.

Speaker 9:          02:07:02       The only way really to do Marineland or to do a story like Marine Le Pen is to have an insider or somebody who's just left and worked inside a long time. And I never thought that I would be able to get somebody. And then when I did, I thought that the story would probably, I would be on it a couple of weeks, maybe a month, it would be some digging. And we're almost a year later. It just kept growing into different stories and his different government departments got involved. It just went on and on. I mean there a period where either myself or, or with another photographer or with Liam Casey, we lived on the road between here and Niagara Falls in May of 2012 I got a phone call from someone who said that there was a lawyer who was talking to somebody who had worked at marine land and talk. This person had some issues with marine land and wondered if I wanted to talk to them. It was really difficult. And finally in the end he decided he would talk to us. And that was filled in Maris, the first whistle blower.

Speaker 10:         02:08:05       Over the course of my tenure at marine land, I was witness to things that people would never imagine a place like marine pen to be capable of.

Speaker 9:          02:08:16       In the end we were working with 15 whistleblowers and it was, um, they're feeling that problems that had existed with the water not being able to get the low levels raid had caused health problems in the animals. And also short staffing had caused problems

Speaker 11:         02:08:36       cause we didn't have the resources, we didn't have the people to get the animals to do these certain tree behaviors that we would otherwise want them to do. The first line of defense was to give him the drugs. I saw things that that resulted in death. You're basically hitting your head against the wall trying to make changes for the better for the animals. And one day I walked in and walked out, uh, just said, that's enough.

Speaker 9:          02:09:02       Oh there was a huge reaction from the public. I mean, a massive reaction. My email was jammed. I think we got something like 270,000 views on the video and the first day the OSP CIA issued orders against marine land on a number of Caribou mainland. Completed all orders from the, but what was also interesting is that the government reacted, the Minister Medlin mayor is bringing in a program one, it's her hope to license zoos and aquariums in Ontario because they're not at this time. The second thing will be special standards of care for marine mammals because there's nothing and the third will be greater powers, more money and greater responsibility and also hopefully Trent more transparency for the OSP. Ca Three of the trainers who spoke to me and have been sued, these are generally slap suits which are basically to to shut them down, but still this hootsuite for I think a million, 1,000,001.

Speaker 9:          02:10:05       They haven't gone to discovery or anything yet and I know they have a lot of supporters. When I did these stories and Liam and I worked together, we were writing about the animals. We had no desire and have no desire, just shut marine land down or anything. There's that Mr. Holder has been saying it butters. All we wanted to do is tell people, we went to marine land, we talked to people, we interviewed people who've worked there. We've looked at records, we've looked at video, and here's what's happening. That's all. And I hope that they're able to make them much better. Marineland

Speaker 5:          02:10:39       yeah, he sued, he sued the trial starts to really chat. Amazing. What'd he sued them for? Um, I don't know exactly their sort of tight lipped at that end. They don't, you know, that they're not going to reveal too much, but the matter of fact is, uh, the Toronto Star or any media, you know, they get a suit. Did you know, in the room of these places, demand an apology if there's been a mistake. Sometimes they just, you know, there's a little little money paid out. Something else starts fighting this completely. They're like, yeah, let's go. Let's do this. Well, we tweeted it. Uh, I just tweeted it about 10 minutes ago. Um, and uh, I'll tweet it again and we'll promote it on this podcast and, and try to get some people to contribute some money to help out your, your legal defense. And my thing is I don't need, I don't need a lot from you and he, a lot of you, she knew a lot of people don't we five bones, man, we can get through this thing.

Speaker 5:          02:11:27       And the other thing is, you know, there's reality TV out there and people obsess over it. They can't believe that this scripted bullshit. I mean, you know about it. I know about it. I was on the TV show white bone. I know about sort of the scripting and things you were on wipe out. I was on white folks. My friends show Mac units. I was going to say, because I think it was shortly after a fear factor that they went with the wipe out. Yeah. It's end them all. Yeah. He created it. Wild wild fear factor was going on, right? Yeah. Yeah. We've, we've been over there many times like that, that place where they filmed it in Argentina or an la? No, they only one. The one I see me when I did the Canadian version that they basically sent this to Argentina. Oh really?

Speaker 5:          02:12:03       Yeah. Yeah. They do like they do it all over the world now. Right. And bunch of different countries and they all go to Argentina. I think the states is the only one that has like a really amazing course. That course is awesome. It's evolved quite a bit. The one that Argentina is like, it's pretty bad ass like donkey Kong and shit. Just like metal rods everywhere like that. She's real. Yeah. It's nasty. It's a fallacy. It's a fall course. So you got mistreated. Much like the animals get mistreated. His fucking, that's the theme here on the show. Yeah. I won though. Oh, congratulations. Thanks. That's awesome. That's bad ass. I owe it all to smoosh. Yes. The only reason I was ever on the video, right. You were doing it to try to earn some money? No, just the, uh, back in 2008, that was like the meat immediate shitstorm that took off.

Speaker 5:          02:12:42       Like Jimmy Kimmel did a piece, like inside edition did a piece of, it was like a fluff piece of smoosh and i's relationship, but it took off. It was on the cover of CNN for awhile. And so I just sort of pieced all that together and applied to wipe out and was like, Hey, I'm this guy. And they were like, hey, you're on. It's okay. So I'll go do that and try to win money. Wow. Well listen man, I hope we help. I hope we helped raise awareness. I thank you. You did a great job of representing your position and representing the, the idea behind what you're trying to do and the situation that you find yourself in. And I think it's very admirable and I think, um, that, uh, I think you're going to get a lot of sport. I hope so, man. I really appreciate your letting me come out here and it was fascinating, man.

Speaker 5:          02:13:23       It was really interesting. I really appreciate you having the balls to do it. Well, balls, idiots. See Christmas, call it part of being a person, Ben. Then the future, they'll look back on it and say it's balls, but right now, whatever you just doing your thing, man. Tweet that shit man. I tweeted it already. Thanks man. And uh, we'll uh, we'll tweet it more in the upcoming weeks and uh, just get in contact with me and if you have more things you need to promote, we'll be happy and really happy to have you come on again and give us an update in a few months and tell us where things are at. Like I was saying reality TV or pay for this, I mean this, it's developing, it's staying on the front pages. So, well, you could get a reality TV show just because of this interview that's in the lawsuit.

Speaker 5:          02:13:59       I can't, you can't. Well, in the lawsuit and the lawsuit they're alleging, I'm really pissed off because why couldn't you get a reality show up? A couple of reality shows were proposed to me after wipe out, right? And in the lawsuit they're saying, oh, these reality shows, that's why he's really mad and making up these lies. And they went through all this shit up. That's how I became the Kanye west of animal training. They say that, but don't say that. Stop you just filled dimmers. Stop this Kanye West. Bullshit. That's gotta stop. It's gotta stop. It's stupid. Uh, but the, the, what I'm wondering when she was about is how could they stop you from doing a reality show? How can they prevent you from earning a living? How can they stop you from expressing yourself in any way that you choose to see more? So it's the sense that with all these lawsuits and no one wants to touch it, no one wants to touch anything.

Speaker 5:          02:14:41       Right? I think that's nonsense. People in America, I guarantee you will touch it. Hey, we had an article that was going on, a very big magazine, a very big man cause he was coming up, was going to tell the Fillon and smooshy story. This thing was going to be, I mean this was godsend. They manage to quash that it's gone. They won't do it because the lawsuits, there's dudes scrambling right now writing your name down. Trust me. This is a, this is with a in America, here's what matters on reality shows, ratings, how many people are watching. If a lot of people were watching it gets on TV. It's that simple, but it's the money generated doesn't support a lawsuit. Then what? I suppose Canada is a different story. I mean we're not talking about if the money generated from what? From a, from a reality show show, which you can start balancing port a lawsuit.

Speaker 5:          02:15:20       In what way? Well, I don't know if someone launched a TV company turns around and talks to me, hey, we want to talk about, we want to do a suit or a show about you fighting a marina marina. She gets immediately sue them, immediately sued them so that TVs coming like thing like that, like universal pictures or something like that is afraid of morale. I haven't got the call from them, but if they call, I suppose maybe they won't. But a lot of people have been scared. A lot of people have been scared. So you alleged that they've been scared off of doing other reality shows? There were, she were to say that there were two. Listen, not that maybe it's probably not a good thing. Well, we know that it's slapped litigation, so it's all bullshit anyways. I'm pretty sure they're done. Let's not bullshit is the cause.

Speaker 5:          02:15:54       It's a great cause and I think, uh, I think this and the movie blackfish has highlighted a real problem that we have is there's a real disconnect with the way we view these animal parks and I think they're fucked up. And I turned this man. Yeah, awareness is important and the conversation is important and I'm glad you got it out there. We lost that 32,000 bucks, but on the flip side, boom, I'm on the Joe Rogan show and blackfish come out. I'll trade that all day. There you go. Boom. Bitches respect. All right.
