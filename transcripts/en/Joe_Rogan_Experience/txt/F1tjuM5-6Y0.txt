Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Is this static? I'm hearing just in the headphones. You heard something? Yeah, but it's gone now. I think live and work and we're lying for happy motherfucking new year. Remember when we used to think that the world's going to end? Well, I used to think that the world was gonna end and even have the license plate. I did a 2012 license plate. I was convinced I was like those Mayans, man. They knew it. I thought it was a real, for sure. The computer thing. Remember the Y Two k? Yeah, I thought that too. Yeah. I stayed home for y two k paranoid. I was to the clock rolled over planes falling from the sky. Yeah. Everybody's worried about the whole grid shutting down. Right. And they wouldn't be able to get it up for months and people would run out of food. I was listening to art bell a lot back then.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Oh, cheers. Cheers. [inaudible] New Year. Happy eight years. Eight years of episodes. Eight years of episodes, 2018 2018 doesn't sound like a real number. It's one of those numbers. You say it and you go, Yup. I guess I guess you're right like 2018 that's like way too close to 2020 which is like space. That's like the future. It's like a movie you don't like alien. Like what was, when you watched the first alien one with sigourney weaver from the late seventies it was like 1979 what do you think the timeline was supposed to be? It's probably 2001 you know, cause there's like a lot of movies like I think blade runner was something like 2017 or something like that. I want to say, I don't remember, but I want to say blade runner was like 2030 or so. It wasn't that there was all the flying cars and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Remember weren't there flying cars or am I thinking of Fifth Element? No, no, there was flying cars. Cause I remember the car is going through like the cool billboards and stuff and I think I confused my Scifi movies a lot. Like old ones played renters 2018 2019 oh my God, that's insane. That's a year from now. That's wow. That's weird. That shows how slow it actually is. Technology thinks it's, you think it's fast. It shows how bad movie writers are guessing. I don't think it shows anything else. Right. I think the guy who's been the best at predicting shit was like wasn't hg wells really good. I feel like hg wells, the science fiction author from, I think he was from the 18 hundreds hg wells, but I think he predicted a lot of shit. Yeah. There's a couple articles about all this stuff you predicted. Oh really? Yeah. The many futuristic predictions of Hg wells. It came true. All right. Let's see what we got here. What did he do or 150 years ago, phones, email and television. What is that real in men like gods? In 1923 wells invites

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       readers to a futuristic utopia that's essentially earth. After thousands of years of progress in this alternate reality, people communicate exclusively with wireless systems that employ a kind of commingling of voicemail and email like properties. Holy Shit, for an utopia except by previous arrangement. People do not talk together on the telephone. He writes, a message is sent to the station of the district in which the recipient is known to be. And there it waits until he chooses to tap his accumulated messages. Whoa. And any that one wishes to repeat can be repeated. Then he talks back to the senders in dispatches. Any other messages he wishes

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       the transmission is wireless. Wow. What I'd like to know if he did drugs back then, like if he was doing mushrooms and yeah, man, I want to know.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       He also imagined forms of true entertainment. Uh, it says in when the sleeper wakes from 1899, the protagonist rouses from two centuries of slumber to a dystopian London in which citizens used wondrous forms of technology like the audio book, Air, plane, and television, yet suffers systematic oppression and social injustice. What in the fuck

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       man, what the fuck hg wells lasers to? How's he so good? It's probably mushrooms. I mean, we'll think of something that hasn't been invented in a hundred years now. What would you invent like me? Well, you know what, here's our problem. It's, I think it's almost impossible once you know something exists to imagine a world in which it didn't exist. So you and I are unique because we're old as fuck. I'm older as fucker than you. But we remember when there was no internet. I think we're the last of the people that are going to remember what life is like when there's no internet. Yeah. And what's next? What's the thing that hasn't been invented that we'll remember? We saw the first stuff like vr. Good question. Having glasses always being well I think that

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       magic leap shit that you know that you've seen that new headset that they uh, are saying they're going to eventually wind up selling. You have like a hip pack and you wear these goggles.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       [inaudible] dude, that seems like step one to me. Apple is putting all their money in ar instead of Vr for that reason. Right. That's what this is, right? This looks like blade runner. Yeah. Maybe that movie's not so far off the uh, the one from Columbus, Ohio blade runner. Oh. Like maybe they're only off by a year or ready player. One ready player. One. Have you seen the preview for that? That's pretty much, this is exact same thing as right here, but this is the Microsoft one. What does the differences, magic leap movie. So magically Biz, not Microsoft. Which one's the Microsoft one? Uh, that would be hololens. Magic leap is the one that's in Florida. They went way away from everybody else so that they're not getting their knology compromised by it. And these are the ones where they had that little a dancer. The dances on your hand.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       Oh, okay. So this is the really intense lifelike augmented reality. Nobody knew what it was going to look like. They thought any prototype had a big giant backpack on and they finally got it down to this little pocket. This is the first time we're actually seeing with this also might not be the final version. It could be smaller. Could be a little bigger. Exactly. Looks cool. It looks very cool. It looks like Superhero. Cool. But the thing is, is it, it's so obvious that you're wearing it. Yeah. They need to get rid of that part and integrate it into the headset. There's like this hip part like batteries plus to wear it in public at least this, this is probably like a home work type thing, like wherever you'd use a personal computer. I feel like we're looking at the seed of a future thing that's going to eat us.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       I'm looking at that. I'm like that. That is exactly how it starts. The electronics cling to the outside and become inseparable and then slowly they work their way into the organism itself to the inside. The organism will accept symbiosis as long as the electronics stay on the outside, but if it goes inside, like if the only way you use your cell phone was a stick it in your ass. Right. There's the only way it works. We have a new cell phone and it works all you have to just stick it in your ass and then just carry it around with you and you make calls with your mind and it's a flip. Yeah. We would say, no way we can't do it, but as long as the electronics from the outside, like I said, dude, they're going to give you a helmet. You get to the electronics going to go right into your eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       You're gonna see some shit that's not there. You're like, okay, where bolt clothing's a tech is the future. Like there's even, I think Levi's and Microsoft or google teamed up and they're, they're trying to do at jacket, like a tech Jagger. We just look at your jacket and read text and stuff off the sleeve and stuff. Imagine having a like a shirt and going like, today I want a purple shirt today. I went to blue shirt. Or you're getting text messages pop up on your shirt. Or if there's a lost child, the child's face is on everybody's shirt. Fuck. I think wearable clothings going to be pretty big sin. Yeah. Especially if you could like, if you could get your arm, like it actually could open up like where it looks like a screen. Yeah. Where if we can get that good where there's no benefit like, and nobody wants a cell phone with a shitty screen. Right, right. Yeah. Because like that, isn't that like the big debate now they all look amazing to me because I'm going blind. Barely. See. But the, if I look at like the x

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       versus the Google Pixel, two xl versus they all look really good.

Speaker 3:          00:09:02       Yeah. It's more like brightness now to me it's like, oh, this one, it seems brighter. I guess they all look really good. They all look amazing. I mean we're really nitpick and which is good. Just shows you how good things are. But could you ever reproduce that on your sleeve? Yeah, they already have that. Perfect. Well like, like the technology is not 100% there, but they already have bendable lcds. Right. And like stuff like that. But the thing is having it feel like clothing and of like this big chunk that's on your shirt, like these things you see at the mall. But I like, I had this, uh, I was talking to Gino speed, we'd about this and the idea of having a hat. Imagine the hat where you can have any logo you want under your hat. You could change at any day. And then you can also have it so it's just moves or something. Like if it's the Nike swoosh you see like the smoke coming out of the, you know, how cool would that be just, and it's weird that we don't see that as a normal thing yet cause it seems like that's already there. You could do that hat right now. Probably have a little three g connection so you can download things on it. You know, using the little thing on the top of the hat.

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       Yeah you probably could button, you probably could. I mean what, anything that you can imagine in the future is probably going to be possible. Like anything, anything you could imagine. I don't think there's are going to be a time in our lifetime we're, we're change is going to happen as quickly as it's happening now.

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       What about shoes? Where, where you could just have like instead of walking your shoes, just roll in Aleks like kind of lied along wide. Yeah. Well isn't that

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       WHO's always goofing around about the aliens? The aliens are, is what we imagined as us in the future. Maybe that's what they really are. Maybe that they're time travelers. Cause if he had to think, like if you go back and look at ancient like Australia pithy gets you ever see like a depiction of Australia pivotus it's like this weird sorta half human monkey things like one of the first people. And if you go back and look at that and then you look at a regular person today, that may be, you know, it takes a spin class and you know, go see if they go to the one where he's standing up, there's some pictures of what they think they would have looked like.

Speaker 3:          00:11:16       It's weird because there is people that look kind of like these people. You sure? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       Some people that are pretty hairy too. I mean they think there's, there's all sorts of different kinds of people too. That's another thing that we forget. There was a bunch of different kinds of people that died off. But the idea is all these people write all these different kinds of little people. They eventually evolve to be human, right? If they stay alive, they get to a point. Well, what happens if you pass the human thing? Do you just stop at human? I don't think you could stop it human when this is not perfect. This is not perfect. This is better. It's better than it, you know, killing each other with rocks in the trees. It's better than that, but it's definitely, we're getting better at this. It's obvious we're getting better at being people collectively. So like where does it go? Does it go to, we just move everything with our brains and our heads or that big robot and we fuck up the environment so bad that we need sunglasses permanently on the outside.

Speaker 2:          00:12:18       And that's what those alien, the black eyes. So we just fixed it. We just give you a fake lens. Your skin's like bulletproof and you move everything into your brain. Nobody needs a mouth anymore. No sex organs. It got too complicated gender. This is the year like this is the machines confused us and got us to the point where they could deliver orgasms through like little little injections in the back of your brain. You just give way more intense orgasms and you would ever get jerking off or having sex. And so everybody just stopped having sex and you're our dicks and vaginas just shy. They just sealed up. We figured out food to the point where now there's no more waste, so no one has has to shit. We just nailed it. That's perfect balance. No one's ever overweight.

Speaker 4:          00:13:10       It's how they have sex and demolition. They put those headsets on and sit across from each other. Oh yeah. They had their feet in the water. It's not water. It looks like water. Yeah. It's where they'd girl drips into. That's so strange. That's how they had sex.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       You know? That's probably going to be better. We gave it this physical thing. We gave it a shot. It's too costly.

Speaker 4:          00:13:31       Okay. Did the food thing makes the most sense? Because we are probably going to run out of food in having like the future of food is going to be really weird where it's just going to be like almost like a, a break. Like I vitamin, well there's my steak, you know? There's,

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       yeah man. Right. The future of food.

Speaker 5:          00:13:50       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       Like when they're, you know, there was some article it real recent, like I think maybe even today that was talking about, um, their progress and synthetic meat. It'd be able to just make meat and laboratory, which is rule. That's a game changer.

Speaker 4:          00:14:08       Don't they already have it where you can buy it. Now I feel like I was gonna bring this up the other day when you talked about fat Burger has the impossible burger.

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       Oh, but that's some plant based meat. Yeah, that's, but that's dinner lab mate. No, no, no. That's some, they've had those for a while. Um, people who are Vegan who used to like cheeseburgers apparently say that this works. Yeah. That you could, you can literally, they, they've looked, but there's some smart people out there. They figured out a way to make things taste different than what they really are. There's a bunch of Vegan cheeses and shit that are really good, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about lab created meet actual meat that somehow or another they, they have some cloning process or something.

Speaker 4:          00:14:54       Yeah. I saw something about the other day and they're pretty much there if not completed with it.

Speaker 6:          00:15:00       I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          00:15:02       That's the, if they can do that, that's fine. If it tastes the same, I would go with lab created me. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       lab created meat. It's probably better for you. Geez. I just, I'm just imagining like, you know what I'm imagining power outage warehouse filled with lab created meat stuck in the pipes.

Speaker 6:          00:15:29       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       do you think the expiration date is on a lab created meat forever? Yeah, they just engineer it with the right bacteria so I could stay on the shelf and definitely, I remember making a mistake that the first time that grocery store I had these things called the complete meals. I don't know what the fuck it's called, but there's like meat, like a biscuits and gravy but not in the cold section. Not In the hot section. And you barely had to heat it up. It was just kind of ready to go meals and my friend ate it. But I think we both got sick as fuck this. So disgusting. But I mean they're still out there. This was seven years ago. It's like those little meals for kids that aren't really food. What's his little lunchables? Lunchables. Those things are the worst for people. That's not even food.

Speaker 2:          00:16:12       Yeah. Those little cheese things. He's take a cracker in. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh those are so gross. Some of them. Some, some. Somebody must have a good one. Bye now. Good little like starbucks has like a decent little snack pack, right? Don't they have one with like celery and beets and shit?

Speaker 4:          00:16:33       Sure. Yeah. They have all this stuff. Starbucks is pretty good. AMC movie theaters has waffles and chicken now. Did you know that?

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       That's amazing. But I think the healthy option thing is because people demand it. Right? Cause there's a bit, why wouldn't they have it is like there's, there's money in it. Yeah. If you go to starbucks sometimes if you're trying to not taking too much sugar or something like that, you look at all that stuff and you're like, God damn it. It's gotta be something in here for me. What's your for me? Like you got all your tasty I site options. Right? Like those cake pops. I'm like, damn, I just go off the reservation and get a fucking cake pop. Right. It's like weird. Like they're really, they're selling sugar just as much as they're selling coffee, which is great. Have you had the Bantam bagels, the Bagel balls or they're amazing. They're amazing. They, I used to like their chocolate croissants but then I found um, the coffee beans, chocolate croissants to be more delectable. So if I was going to go off, I go to the coffee bean.

Speaker 4:          00:17:36       Don't mess with that. I don't, don't mess with starbucks. I just got it. You have a relationship at starbucks? It's just right next door. Every time I get a coffee bean though, when you get used to certain tastes of coffee, even if the coffee is better, it's really to go like, that's not an ice coffee in my head in ice coffee, starbucks, iced coffee. This is just like some other bullshit. Like I went to Denny's the other day, maybe the best coffee I've had in a long time and you can't buy that anywhere. You have to go to denny's. Yeah. They don't sell you denny's coffin. I was looking for a k cup for it, you know, they look correct. Cups speaking

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       Denny's is a, that's probably like the biggest breakfast chain ever, right? Yeah, it's gotta be, it's like I hop and Dennis, those are the two

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       you could have. There's like a standard you like, there's a balance between how delicious it is, how cheap it is. You gotta be real careful with that balance. You know, like it's a different concept than a regular restaurant, like a regular restaurant. But it is a regular restaurant, right? I mean, I hops a fucking regular restaurant and Burger there the other day, but even if you eat there, you like, even if you eat healthy there, you're like, oh, I fucked up with die off. Right. Because everything is so delicious. You look at it whipped cream on top of shit and a menu and those marriage, she know cherries and you're like, oh Jesus, this is at Ihub.

Speaker 4:          00:18:57       Okay. And then you have that row of syrup already on your table. I think I want to add blueberry taste to it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       If you're gonna just go off ihops the spot to go off, right? The story. Yeah. Yeah. South Carolina, man hilariously cooks himself breakfast at Waffle House while employees sleeps. Oh my God. That's funny. Yeah, he's taking pictures. The guys just asleep in the corner. Oh my God. That is hilarious. That is hilarious. Oh my God. Is that illegal? Could those guys get in trouble for that? Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:19:30       Maine taking the pictures and incriminating yourself? Probably not the smartest move and putting them online, but probably not. That's a good question. It's like a no harm, no foul kind of thing. I think. No harm, no foul. We got hurt in this situation. I wonder if he put money down now. He said he came back. It says he came back the next day and gave a $5 tip. Wow. Okay. One employee working whole waffle house. What if, what if like 10 people walk in? 20 people walking. That seems weird. That seems ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       I hate waffle. Waffle houses are amazing. You like Raphael good. Yeah man. If you're on the road, it's like three o'clock in the morning until like the greatest things that have ever existed. If you're on the road, like let's pick up some weird spot in South Carolina or something like that. That's exactly where this was. Ooh. What's Columbia? Less Cold Sea Jesus that was just out there. Straight up. Guess

Speaker 4:          00:20:28       all the waffle house's in Ohio are like connected to strip clubs. So I always considered it being like gross food because yeah, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       Yeah man, I, we probably been about 10 of those on the road. Yeah, they're always like a good option. It's also 24 hours, so, yeah, that's right. That's why it's so crazy. That's why it gets weird. Waffle houses get weird. 3:00 AM New Year's Eve waffle house. All it takes is one crazy person to walk in. Guy Fieri era. I just had to close his restaurant. You say that with Glee. Why do you do that? No, I just called Miss Ohio native. We have to, you've got to support your own. No, I'm just saying that that went fast. You know, all die theory is a, um, he's a funny guy. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:21:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       I like how he wearing, I like people that wear their sunglasses backwards on their neck. What you don't want, I don't get with him is why so many people get rick a guest. They don't like that he spikes his hair. They don't, what is it that they don't like? I think it's just an easy target. I don't know. I mean he seems nice. I met him once. He was nice. I don't care if he likes to wear his hair like that. It's like a don king thing. Am I mad at Don King? He can't change his look. That's what he's known for it. Is it racist as a white guy with blonde hair spikes his hair up and people just automatically assume you're a Douche. Is that racist? Like a nickelback thing? Like people don't really hate that model. I mean they probably did a little bit, but I wear my hair like that sometimes. Yeah. Billy Corgan, I don't know if he was trolling or not. Um, I don't think he was, he, he was talking to me about how good he thinks nickelback is.

Speaker 6:          00:22:12       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       I think nickelback has some fuck good songs. I do what I do. I know the first day of the main prompt people had little man. I listen, I enjoy the way that a rock star song sounds. I know that's sort of a, a song that's been covered, you know, like that's, that style of song has been covered a few times. Right. But I liked that one. I mean I like the Cypress Hill one better. Remember? So if you want to be a rock star, you know, it's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       It's the same thing. Yeah. It's the same thing. It's like there's a style of song of like describing what it's the lifestyle of a rock star. So the only problem with the nickelback song is that it had been done before because if it hadn't been done before, they did a really job covering that subject. Like their, their take on it was, was good. It was very polished, maybe too polished for some people. We like Shit Ra. We like to hear that Janis Joplin growl, right? We like to heat here, amy winehouse. There's something we like about that raw shit to so remind us, remind us. You're just like us. That's the problem. I think some musicians have with nickelback there sort of considered at least they were and what's called like an end the box type of bandwidth for recording purposes. I They Canadian. Yeah, that's it. That's all it is. So it is, yeah. Canadians are so nice. You don't

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       believe him did this. They would record,

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       uh, no, no. Um, affects on their sounds on their guitar for instance. No distortion, no delay. They'd record literally putting the guitar right into this board, kind of in it record this real weird electronic sound that you could manipulate completely in pro tools later, changing everything about it. They were like one of the first bands that got popular doing that, I think. And so that's sort of like, I'm sure traditional musicians had a big problem with it. Isn't nickelback the band that like every single one of their songs sound exactly the same. Like whiny

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       that guy. It's not whiny. Well, it's like, I wouldn't say whiny. I'd say it's poppy. It's like very good pop music. I mean we'll try and be nice here. I don't, I like a lot of their songs, but I'm trying to be nice here. Like I understand if people would get upset that it's not their style in music, you know, it's people that like like real level. They'll play something for you. Like to play the Beatles like

Speaker 5:          00:24:50       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       lucy in the sky with diamonds. He put on some headphones and listen to a loose smoke, a joint, put on some headphones and listen to a song that was created by the first wave of British superstars that came to America and they're on acid and the saying about lucy in the sky with diamonds and it's, it's amazing. It's amazing. Do that.

Speaker 5:          00:25:25       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:25:28       Right now, do you want us to do it right now? Just thinking I want to, I want to think about this for a second.

Speaker 5:          00:25:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       Just imagine, imagine what it was like back then. Imagine, imagine being in like 1960 whatever the fuck it was when all this was going on.

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       What do you plan the background? It takes forever. I thought I was going crazy after my two stone. I'm having a dad. I was listen to led Zeppelin came on last night and I forgot. I don't know how to say the word. Dear dire maker. How do you say it? Yeah, it's a bad ass song. I forgot.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       Oh Dude. There's so many good songs. There's so many good songs now. This is the thing. The songs are better. They're better than nickelback. Yeah, right. It's not mold, but nick or backs not bad saw that. It's just, if you want to compare Jimi Hendrix to the rest of the world, the rest of the world's going to suck a fat deck. This, there was a guy that knew how to do it better than everybody else. It doesn't mean that. It doesn't mean Eric Clapton wasn't an amazing guitarist. It means everybody always looks at Jimmy Hendrix in a better way. For whatever reason, Matt, for whatever reason, you know, I'm sure there's people that would see it the opposite way. It doesn't mean nickelback socks. They've gotten your man, Bro.

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       Like they just word the Beatles, you know, but that's like a, I guess there's a different category between like, you know, they Beatles led Zeppelin and Nicole Vac, right? Maybe there is, but maybe we should just relax. I mean, I'll take two smash mouseover I'm just saying maybe we should just relax like about everything. I think we're picking, we're looking for tribal enemies that don't exist, you know, just because you like to eat, you know falafels and, and you know, like extra ketchup on your fries and I don't, you know, or you, you like to go running and I like to take naps. You know, who cares? This is, this is my perspective in 2018 I think the more we can relax that we will have less conflict, interpersonal conflict, which often fuels extra personal conflict. It's 2018 and let it go. You can like nickelback I told somebody that I like Ellie King and uh, they gave me like a sidewards face.

Speaker 2:          00:27:56       I'm like, fuck you. I don't even hit that is, you know who that is? You ever heard that song x's and o's? Oh Dude, she's bad ass x isn't her whole album is bad ass. What is that? Uh, what does that, that album called, do you call it an album anymore? Because it used to be a c it was an album and then you were an old man if you were calling it an album, it's a cd Bro. And then it stopped being a CD and it became an album again. I download it. I just say I downloaded it. What do you say? Do you say you say it's an outlet? Call it CD. I still say CTA, I think. I don't think I do album. I mean, do you remember when people would mock you if you said album? Cause they'd be like, you mean cd?

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       It's his cd now called the CD. Like, oh, okay. Okay. That was like a phase where people got conti about the distinctions between cds and albums and then all of a sudden vinyl made a little comeback during the CD era, people decided that vinyl was a, how would you describe a Jamie? What's the, what's the difference between the sound? Oh, it's warmer. It's got a nice warm, you always say warmer. That eight out vinyl is huge now. So big. Like I went to a vinyl store the other day that was like being in a record store in the 70s like I was like, it was all vinyl. What people are digging it, man. They, they, they get into it. It's a tactile relationship with the music. That's what Henry Rollins was explaining it to me. And the way he describes it, it's really intoxicating because he's such an an an addict to that kind of music and he has a whole set up in his house where these crazy speakers that are like stupid expensive and he has this amazing record collection and he'll just sit there and play his records and he does a radio show, I believe it's once a week.

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       Is it once a week? He does a radio show once a week where he picks the songs and he plays the music. It's all his selections. What does it on Kr kcrw. Here's this great speakers. Yeah. So he's got these fucking nutty ass speakers, man. Look at these things and he stands in front of these things and I really enjoyed talking to him, man. He's an uniquely unusual person. I always thought he was like, I am going to be completely honest. When he was a young guy and he did that, uh, beavis and butthead thing, liar. Do you remember that? Why it Beavis and butthead? It was hilarious, dude. He had an amazing song called Ama Liar. You ever seen rollins? You don't know that song. There's like one of his breakout hit songs as a connected with that and he was super jacked. That was in his full on power lifting days.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       And I remember seeing him go at this guy is like way too intense. How is this a fucking cigarette? A band. That guy looks like he wants to rip your fucking head clean off your body and just pull your guts through your neck hole. He looked so crazy scary and uh, I could never figure it out. I was like, that's so weird that this guy is, um, I forgot a singer. In my mind, a singer had to be a certain type of person. They had to be a Jon Bon Jovi or they had to be Robert Plant. They had it, you know, there was a style that you could be a singer and he was just completely new, weird thing. This jacked up power are covered in tattoos. I was like, whoa. But when you meet him, I mean maybe it's cause I'm meeting him later in his life when he's mellowed and matured, but he is one of the most fascinating guys I've ever talked to.

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       One of the most absolutely unique individuals. Like, oh, I never met one at you. The guy is obsessed with productivity and work and creating obsessed with it. His writing, he writes for like a bunch of different publications, constantly writing, constantly traveling, goes to places, just gets on a plane, flies over to that spot, lands with buys water and starts fucking meeting people. It doesn't know where the fuck he is. Just puts himself in these weird positions and some of them like super dangerous, fascinating guy, man. Never met a guy like him. I heard him on our, he's podcast, one of the, one of the main um, podcast that he did that really like fucking blew my mind was him describing all this travel that he does on Ari show cause you know, our, he's a travel nut too. So the two of them together, it's like wow.

Speaker 2:          00:32:23       I think he probably was one of the inspirations or at least help fuel the inspiration that Ari had when he already took off for like four months. I didn't know he was on Ari's podcast. That's a good catch for Ari. It's an amazing episode. I believe they were in Edinburgh. I believe they were there for the fringe festival in Edinburgh and I think that our was performing and um, he, he's going to get mad. I know he told me this story and I don't remember it. You hear a lot of stories though. I heard too many. Somehow or another, someone set it up, but um, it's a great podcast nonetheless, however it transpired. But Henry Rollins is a, here it is. Not all those who wander are lost. That's exactly what the name is. Skeptic tank two 77 yeah. So now awesome podcast. I mean like a life changer.

Speaker 2:          00:33:16       Like you listen to that podcast and his, what? He gets out of travel, you go, oh yeah. Why wasn't I looking at it that way? Like know why was I just going to places going up? Can they drink the water? Is this safe? Like what is this? Okay, where's he's going over there going, hell, what do you do man? What's going on? Like, what do you, what do you people up to? He's like, really? Like going into uncharted territories all the time or on a regular basis, picks a spot in the map. Just goes like, that's one of the things that I've always said about Ari. I like people who just go for it, you know, like Ra should fear just goes for it. It takes you, goes away for like four months. He just vanishes. He goes forward with how he does comedy. You know, I'm gonna go do comedy in China, you know, he just goes for it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       It'd be funny if when he vanishes, but he actually has another life that he doesn't tell anybody about family kids, the husband didn't he have an entire nother life when you guys did a podcast together and Ari did Salvia on your podcast and he, the way he described it, his like he, I'm not conflating these, right. This is, am I confusing this? This is when it was the same. He did it on your podcast and then this was the Salvia trip where he said that he lived like a whole life for like three months and there was something with water in a bus or something like that. Well, there was he, I'm sure he's described it somewhere. Yeah, a Reddit Ama. I think he felt like he had lived a whole life like for months, a whole different life for months. And then came back from that trip.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Like it just happened. He realized, Oh my God, no, I just took Salvia. They really got rid of Salvia fast, didn't they? You remember when that was legal, you'd just buy it online and then two within like a year, they just kind of took care of Salvia. What is little distinction legally for Salvia now it's the scheduling. They went fast on that legal marijuana but lip. Amen. But Dude Salvias Ooh, stronger than marijuana. Oh, this is what people didn't know you. People were going to their pot dealers and they trying to, you know, get some good weed. Why you want to have a good experience? Salvia used to be for sale at head shops everywhere and it was one of the most Bolo out of your fucking mind. Psychedelics you could ever encounter right now. You still buy it. I used to buy it. Careful Times 80 concentrated 20 x right here, one 20 eggs, cheese.

Speaker 2:          00:35:54       It's even stronger now. Oh my God, I bet it's not legal. You should. I wonder if it shows what states they will ship to or if you try to buy it. It tells you like, Hey, this is a legal and illegal in most parts of the world and here's the, here's the big problem with all these things. I think all these things could be handled way better than they have been. So people are going buck wild with them, whether it's mushrooms or whether it's a lsd or anything. People left these important compounds in the hands of people that were willing to take them illegally and that's where most of our data's coming from because they couldn't do any tests on anything. Everything was just scheduled one schedule one. But the people that tested it, there are people willing to take mushrooms. It's a lot of people did with just white knuckle.

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       That shit to death. Me included at various times in my life, he tried to bring me mushrooms. I'd white knuckle myself to death. So it was the people, the only sampling size that we have from the benefits that people that were wild enough to do it. Like what if we had actual scientists studying the shit go, hey, maybe we took the stuff and like low doses. We could evolve quicker. Like this really might be something. There might be something legitimate to the idea that stoned ape theory is that humans discovered psilocybin mushrooms and that's why the brain grew like double its size over a period of 2 million years. That's the theory, I think. Right? Mushrooms could have totally been in that mix with all the other stuff too. All the other stuff. The throwing arm hunting is a film on the naughty show podcasts for an old death squad studio.

Speaker 2:          00:37:34       Oh, it said what happened was I took a hit of Salvia, but I didn't quite take a big enough hit or I didn't hold it long enough so it took me right to the edge of disappearing into my mind, but I didn't quote it, but it didn't quite get me through the barrier. So I took another hit. This time the hit was as big as I could possibly muster. It was massive and I held it for a really long time. That hit alone would have been enough to make me obliterate my consciousness, but that hit coupled with the one from before that all that got me almost there, put me in another place. I was in a lake in the backyard of my childhood home, but I wasn't me swimming there. I was a new being who lived underwater. It took me a little bit of time to learn how to breathe water, but then I learned and I was there for a while. I mean like months at least I estimate I was there anywhere from four months to two years. I made friends. I had a life

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       all underwater. At some point, my new life, I saw Sam Aaa at the store, at the shore of the lake, so I swam up to him to investigate. Pratt says he was just sitting in the chair across from me. In reality, that's when they started pulling me back into this existence, but what they didn't know was that I couldn't breathe air anymore. I've forgotten how after breathing underwater for so long, I had to relearn the experience of breathing. They says, man, that was a good trip. It looked Talus if you watch the video. But what's important to understand is that the, that the hellish part was not me wanting to leave my friends, family and life and the lake. It was just adjusting back to this reality that hurt. But the months or years I was living there with some of the most beautiful and peaceful of my life. Oh Shit. Ours brain broke. I know now. Now I should look at the video and imagine that he lived there for four years. It's totally different when he say, no, I feel bad for getting them into drugs. Look here now. Here's what the four years he went through, you're allowed to play audio.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       The smuggling, he's still holding. He's sleeping or dead.

Speaker 7:          00:39:52       So this is a, a video that we're watching that all took place in Brian's apartment.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       I think he's dead. Somebody give me is fucking funny. Stop. Oh my God.

Speaker 7:          00:40:06       You had to shush people. Well, it's like he was chairman heart. I didn't want him to freak out. Right. Good call. See, I'm Tripoli. Shut your mouth. Who else was there? Triple anywhere else. Aaa. Jason Teebo, Alison

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       and Maddie. Kirsch maybe. Oh, what a great time to trip people staring at you talking mad shit while you're blown out of your mind into another dimension grab. Oh Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:40:36       Tell us this long. So I think probably people, because this is all right, you can find this is something you got it. It only works visually, but if you see it visually, it's fascinating. So it's a Ari Shaffir on Salvia and it's on Brian's. Is it on yours or it's on it. So on red bands, a youtube page, Ari Shaffir on Salvia Salvias wide every quarter. Ari Salvia is why it never did dmt because I had too many like, okay, I'm too old for this. I might break my brain moments that I'm like, I don't need to do anymore. Yeah, there's, there's some weird weird drugs out there. Re we're really, really weird ones. And part of the problem with like legal definitions for what what is and isn't legal, there's like gets, it gets kind of weird and blurry. Like there was some stuff called five Meo dimethyltryptamine, which is the most potent form of, of DMT. And up until like the year 2000 and like you'd be able to order it online.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       They would just send it to you. It's illegal. Just says not for human consumption were like, I don't know what you're doing with it, but here it is pure and you'd be able to get enough to blast yourself in the universe every day of your life until you're dead for like 50 bucks. It was crazy. It was crazy. It was the wild west because people didn't know what it was yet because they had made a distinction that n n dimethyltryptamine, which is the one that gives you all the visual hallucinations, that that was more illegal. That was, that was the moment. That was a schedule one drug that was, but they had listed five methoxy diamond field trip to me. So it was in this weird state of limbo. Salvia. They just missed it. What? That stuff the fuck outta here. I can't believe it's Smith.

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       Steagall did. This is probably a shitload of those in the Amazon. There's probably a shit load of things that are not, never been discovered. Nini eat some fruit and you fucking go blast off into the center of the universe. I bet. I bet that, I bet if we could allow, if we all decided, all right, we're going to leave. Let's, let's have humans live everywhere except one really big spot. No people can live at this one really big spot. We got to manage like other kind of ecosystems in a more hands off sort of a way because we're just so d like separate like the Congo and places like that, but if there was like one country where everybody agreed, all right, let's just leave this, leave this spot alone. No one go in there. Let's see what happens. Let's see how nature evolves while we observe it with modern methods. Just like step back for a few hundred years just as a human project. Let's see what kind of shit grows in there. If you just leave it alone because we're so fucking snippy. Snippy. Let me get in there and let me dig. Let me fucking cut these down and I'll plant new ones. Don't worry about it bro. I'm to plant new ones. Dude. I got this, I cut down the forest and put some new ones on. Not Saying that I'm not hypocritical sitting here in front of a wood desk, you know, I'm not saying don't do it,

Speaker 5:          00:43:39       but

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       I mean think of how weird that is.

Speaker 2:          00:43:44       If we could just leave all that shit alone, who knows what kind of weird symbiotic relationships we could have had with plants that might have easily been how they came up with Iowasca in the first place. It probably eating a bunch of weird fucking plants and all those plants. We're talking with all those other plants and I'm like, listen, I know. I know where we can get just shit bumping way quicker. We got to get these monkey people to to figure out how to eat these mushrooms and turn it to regular people. Imagine, imagine if that's really what it was all long just grasses and leaves communicating to us through some nonverbal language and and giving us this idea of how to do certain things

Speaker 5:          00:44:31       and

Speaker 2:          00:44:31       the, all these things are all just designed to get us to eat the mushrooms we eat. The mushrooms get to the point where we accelerate to the point we have enough brain power and enough people combined interacting with each other and sharing information that we can build artificial life. And then that becomes the new thing. Or along the way we become the aliens. We've figured out how to use that crispr technology, crispr technology. You know what that is. It's some new thing. Uh, I brought up on the podcast a lot, so if you've heard it before I apologize, but it's some sort of a, I'm going to butcher the definition again. It's some sort of a genetic, um, uh, altering system that they're, they're creating a gene changing system where they can do things to the human body potentially, uh, where they can alter genetics that can alter DNA.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       It's very complicated and I'm doing a terrible job describing it would, it has essentially let me, for a dumb person like me, really super smart people have figured out a way to change biology. They might be able to turn genes on and off like for autism for Alzheimer's, like weird weird genes that create birth defects or various illnesses that we've, we've been able to figure out how to target. They might that we identify whether they might be able to target those things. They will shut things off, turn things on. And I think there was an article really recently saying that the original crispr is now even out of date and the new one is far superior there did just getting better at it. They're going to, they shot some shit into some dude. Uh, there was a guy who had a disease and it was, I believe it was an incurable disease.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       He was the first human recipient of crispr technology. That's like seeing it as science fiction movie. Right. You hear about the first guy that gave it a chance to Chris or Christopher and 2.0 is here and it's way more precise. See if you could find the article about the guy that was the first human recipient for crisper. Why is it spelled like that? Like, like a 14 year old emo kid wrote in the basement. Like there's no e it's a CRI s p r I think they wanted it to be catchy. And uh, I think it's also, what is that an acronym? It's an acronym, right? Yeah. I always fuck up acronym. And the other one, like what's the dea? It's an acronym. That's an acronym. I thought it was an acronym when you said it, but that's not what it could become as a word. Yes. I don't think it meant yes.

Speaker 2:          00:47:09       Right. NASA, like you say, NASA, you don't say the n Asa. Right. So what's the difference when those, I think NASA isn't, is that I'm so dumb now that it's just weird, you know, knowledge and an abbreviated form of the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word, as a word. Okay. So NASA would be an acronym. So I was right. I was dumb as I thought that one of the drag, I was super nervous. I am, Oh, I've always been insecure about, uh, those kinds of things like that. You're probably should know like what an acronym is. Like,

Speaker 4:          00:47:45       I don't know that any of that shit anymore. How do you even remember it was talking about something I saw or was your mind is more that I saw him planners to this weekend or is it just came on Netflix. So good. There's this island that only birds can get onto and honest island is a tree that has the seeds that um, are sticky seeds. So they get stuck onto the birds. And when the birds travel from island to island, they kind of drop them off or whatever. But also the seeds can kind of trap the birds there and they can end up now just had right there. They can get die because they can't get too many of them get stuck in the birth, gets stuck and then they end up falling onto the ground and then get absorbed into the ground and eating the plants. Sort of eat them, if you will.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       Yeah. Oh, it's kinda crazy. Whoa. That's okay. But here's the thing, is that coincidence is, is just like dumb luck evolution I suppose. Yeah, I think that's, yeah, it's dead birds. Maybe evolution is like a word that's so under fire.

Speaker 6:          00:48:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       With the a lot of people, maybe this is because the, the, the ramifications of it that it's, that we're not even, we're not even going to be, the final thing is going to be something like

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       where did Darren does, that's how he found out about Darwin's Galapagos Islands where he went the first time. Imagine going in there for the first time and see and all sorts of crazy,

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       you know what's really fucked up. People have gone there and they go there with shit in their shoes and seeds from their shoes get into the Galapagos islands and non native plants start growing and they identify that it comes from literally from people like walking through fields near their house and wherever the fuck they live and then go to the Galapagos and walking around and that island is so, it's been so isolated that it's as like delicate immune system that they have to monitor and just the cracking or shoe could have a seat in it. Yeah. Do you know there's a lot of those islands. I heard the craziest story. It's a story about goats that these pirates was it pirates? Hmm. I might've made that part up, but these old sailors, these old sailors used to, uh, used to bring goats to islands and they would let the goats off so the goats could populate the island and then they would have things to eat when they would come back.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       Cause goats eat everything. Goats are savage goats in the sailors diet during the golden age of piracy. Okay. I didn't make it up. See, I'm so paranoid. So paranoid being stupid funny though, if you, but it's true. So they would, uh, show up. They would put these goats, they would bring boatloads of goats and does leave them on an island and they would say, next time we're around this area, we got food. Just go to these stupid goats. They eat everything. They eat everything. But that's the thing, man. They eat fucking everything. They devastate ecosystems. I had a friend who had goats. He had goats. He has this really sweet ranch, and he had goats. He's like, oh, I'll just have goats. They'll trim up the lawn and it'd be great. But the fuck they do, they eat everything. Everything. They just eat, man, you just leave shit out.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       They eat that and they need everything else too. They roses, they eat all your vegetables. You get, there's not a tree that's growing. They're eating everything. They just go through a hillside. People use them. They have like, uh, like services where companies have trained goats and they bring them to your farm or wherever the fuck you want to just let these goats Lou. And it's just like eats everything. They just, they shit all over the place. They eat all over the place and they just keep going. They're hilarious though. Yeah. So they, so they had a problem with these goats on one of these pristine islands. There's too many of them. So what they did is they took one of them and they put a collar on them so they could always locate them. They captured him and I think they, they snipped him. They gave him a little, a vasectomy, so he couldn't make any more goats.

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       And then goats always flocked to other goats. So what they would do is this one guy with the collar, they would use him to locate the other goats. Then they would gun them all down from the sky, so they would fly over and they're like, up there. There we found him tucked. I thought that that gun down all these fucking vegetable eating goats at it invaded this island. It's a, it's a crazy podcast, I believe. I'm trying to remember the name of it was on radio lab, which isn't even a sponsor, but I bring it up three times a month. Galapagos just called Galapagos. Yeah, so it is about that very island is about Galapagos and it's about these goats that they just decided at a certain point in time with it. You have to control the populations of them or they're going to devastate everything else. There's a massive imbalance. Somebody fucked up. They brought goats to a place where there's no predators, like goats are supposed to be around, like lions and shit. You know, they're not supposed to be just by themselves, just eating everything and going off. It'd be fun to watch him do it. Yeah. Yeah. It would be fun.

Speaker 3:          00:52:43       Jihirah right about that. Utuber what he's going through. Logan. Paul. I did read that. Yeah. He, he films someone who had committed suicide in Japan and he put it on his youtube channel. Yeah. There, I guess there's this forest at the, the bottom of a volcano or something and it called suicide for her, its nickname suicide forest because everyone just goes there to commit suicide. And he was going there supposedly to film how it's haunted and then they find a body and it's pretty gross. How He, you know, how the video was a, he kind of joked about it. He used humor. Jamie told me that the thumbnail had him like posing with the guy, you know, in the background and, and you know, he's, um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       I don't know anything about him, but I know he's a youtube guy. Right. And he's doing stuff that he thinks is interesting and provocative, you know, and for whatever reason, the, the dialogue that I had read was something to the likes of that he had done it to bring a, he'll apologize for it, which seemed obviously felt terrible about the way people viewed it, but that he said that, um, how did he describe it? Um, he was trying to bring some sort of a, he thought he was going to bring some sort of an awareness to suicide, but it was like a clunky, he just didn't do it right and prayed the respect that it deserved. He realized that he fucked up. He's basically saying he's trying to do something and you fucked up, you know? I don't know, man.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       It's pretty gross. I just found out that he's not the same. Like there's a Jake Paul and it look and Paul, I thought they were the same person. Why blood? Why is everyone okay,

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       matt? I don't know what anyone's mad at him for the mad at him because he showed you something you didn't want to see. Is that what it is?

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       Because the video, he kind of like, they were like, look at his hands, they're blue and oh and like kind of, he kind of was very poor taste. He also advertised it like the day before, like I had this crazy sick video you guys are going to freak out about and you should have like that. Oh, so he got a chance to look at it and you still approved it and then released it. Yeah. And then he made a thumbnail where it looked like he posed for like photos with a guy in the background. It's very, you know, this was a person and, and they're like laughing right next to this body. You know, it's,

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       but I dunno, that disturbs the shit out of us. Right. Like making, like joking around. He could joke around, but he can't joke around near a dead guy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:01       Well, suicide's not funny, so it's not, if the guy died, like natural causes, no one's laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       The suicide, the laughing at him, joking around near the guy who committed suicide. Like, I'm not saying you should do it. You definitely shouldn't. I don't want to see it. But it's Kinda funny that we like decide, like you said, just respectful bro. But he didn't really do anything. He just showed up and this guy was dead, you know? I'm not saying he should make fun of him. We definitely shouldn't, but it's, it's weird the outrage that we have for it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:30       I'm sure he made a shit load of money because I've got 7 million viewers and you made money off it as suicide. Yeah. And you're talking about, and we're talking about it, we're helping them out. Well, the video got pulled, but I guess I've got re uploaded a few times. He just made a second apology today because the first apology a lot of people said was very insensitive,

Speaker 2:          00:55:46       defending him. Don't, don't get me wrong, I'm just exploring. I look, sometimes I try to look at things from as many perspective as her, Ken, and I don't, I don't, uh, I don't think that you ever want to make fun of someone dying. Right. Right. When you're right there and you're, you're, you're taking videos and you know, it was a dead body hanging. It's a terrible idea.

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       Now of 20. This was 20 years ago. It'd be okay. Probably probably, you know what, the most horrific, terrific

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       video or a photograph or other, I think that a I ever saw about the civil rights movement. There's this photo of a, all these weird white, but like

Speaker 1:          00:56:26       if I remember correctly, there's kids. I remember counting. I might've made that up, but I remember these people standing there while there was this black guy hanging from a tree. It might've been more than one black guy and it's a, it's one of those photos. It just make you go,

Speaker 5:          00:56:42       whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       It's holy Shit. They're one of the most disturbing photos. This is a right there. Like look at that photo. That's, that is the exact photo. Oh, actually it a white guy there too. That's weird. We see a pirate. The must have been something went wrong. Photo actually says, Oh get, that's the real one. That's the real one. Son of a bitch. That is the real one. Now I remember God, my memory's starting to suck. The guy pointing up that looks like a Hitler. But those look like white guys too, Bro. Oh, okay. That's round. Does it. The guy on the left that's just like light. There's something super disturbing about dudes with those old school press hats on staring up at bodies, hanging from ropes. Fuck man, that wasn't that long ago. You know? That's a, that's what's horrifying. But that was less than a hundred years ago and it still happened probably right? What year was that?

Speaker 5:          00:57:44       No,

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       but by, but that way, 1930 1930 holy Shit. That that way was like accepted in 1930

Speaker 5:          00:57:57       wow.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       All this sun new stuff like this magic leap, these headsets, all these different things that we're doing. I think they're gonna. I think we're in the middle of this so it doesn't, it's not registering is how fucking ridiculous it is and how insane it is. I think we're just so caught up in the frothy waves of how crazy all this new shit is that we're not, we're not really paying attention enough. This is, this is happening way quicker than I thought it was going to.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       We went flying cars by now though. Now he's going to be robots. Those Boston dynamic backflip in gymnastics robot's going to win the Olympics because other than proven they can do it. Is there any benefit in a robot being able to do a backflip? Dude, could you imagine those no benefit just to look cool. I just wanted to check. No, no, not at all. Could you imagine if I'm the first robot enters into the Olympics and then people are like, Hey, what the fuck? You can't do that. Like, no, and he just, we gave him all the strengths of a regular person. 100% no more, no less, and he has feelings too, so let them in there and don't be a robot. Phobic goes back to my one question. What gender are the robots or the AI? Females. Yeah. No, you know what it

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       is. They're, they're the first neutral gender people and there's so much happier. There's neutral gender. Nobody cares about gender. Just be nice. That's all they care about. There's no boy, girl. They figured out a way to get past that with that crispr shit. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       We seen that new sex robot. You should get that for the stadium. All right Brian, you can order it now, but you don't want the first models man funnier that way. One of them sharper image besides things and breaks your desks. They don't break you discs. I think it'd be funny to have the first version now had early version before they have massage chairs. They just have this actually asked, they might've had massage chairs at the same time, but they had this thing that you would grab a hold of. It had like handles on the side and it did like Shiatsu remember that thing? It was like, like little like little metal knuckles. It would dig in your neck. It's like, this is amazing. But uh, when I was doing, I was like, how is this, they're gonna someone's gonna get hurt like some little old lady and you've forced that fucking thing on their neck. Like, Yo, be careful with this thing. This thing's got some kicks

Speaker 2:          01:00:27       to it. The best thing I ever found for that kind of shit is a time massage. You ever go get a time massage to stand on you and stretch you out? That's the shit. Yeah, that's better than any machine. There's something about a person just doing it. Like getting in there with their elbow is so much better than any machine.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       Yeah. I have this little girl I go to and she has like the, like the handles where she holds onto and it's just digging her knee and your back. And I always say medium and it hurts like hell. I can't even imagine the hard one.

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       Ties have so many things nailed. They can figure it out. The best form of kickboxing, you know, Thai boxing changed everything. It's weird. This one small place figured out the way to do it was the kick people's legs. And you know how they figured it out, man? Gambling,

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       gambling made it profitable to have fights all the time because people loved gamble. So they'd have all these people fighting and ties. They even altered their style to accommodate the gambling. Like the first round they would go real slow because they wanted everybody to place their bets. So Pete, they would just take it slow and everybody knew the fight didn't really begin to the second of the third round, so it wasn't like American fighting where you'd have like a Mike Tyson who be cherished for knocking people out very quickly. Like, like what? Like there would be over under bets is this guy is Tony Tubs gonna last the first three rounds, three minutes of the fight is Michael spinks gonna last the first three like world class fighters. Dude magic get hit by Mike Tyson when he was 20 years old mountain man. How horrible that would be. He was at the fights this past weekend. I said, I know him.

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       Hi Mike. That's so weird. It's

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       amazing. He's still a tank to dude. Terrifying looking person. Or there's a video of him hitting the bags like 51 years old or something like that, hitting the heavy bag and you're like, oh, okay. You could still fuck you up. Hundred percent like in terms of like retired heavyweight champions, there was a trend that existed. You know where someone would retire and then they would, you know, they wouldn't, they wouldn't keep their form. They would get heavy. And that happened with Mike. He got like very heavy look at this. 49 year old, 49 so this is like two years ago. Yeah. Fuck all this. Give me some volume.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       Fuck that dude. 49 year old Mike Tyson will put you to sleep 100% and when you're around him, you realize he like, he's just, who was that? A rapper? Meek Mill. Oh, that's, oh, make C. I blame his trainers right there. If I was the guy holding the camera, it'd be like, stop it. Okay. First of all, we've got to straighten this whole thing out before you start hitting hard. You gotta you gotta move all this. This might be just a personal trainer, not a boxing person, but I'm looking in the background and I feel like I see boxing and stuff on the wall. They pray that played that video. Young Mike Tyson with custom motto. Oh my God, I want to change the way you feel about physics.

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       Custom motto was old and dying. He was a really old guy, but he had just this deep knowledge of psychology and boxing and he trained this unbelievably fast and powerful talented kid who had massive hunger for success. The whole story of Mike Tyson, a lot is wrapped up in the story of custom auto who had been around forever, and this is his last and greatest pupil. And Mike [inaudible], Mike knew it while it was happening, and by the time he won the heavyweight championship, custom mono had already died. But he dedicated it all to him. There was nobody like him. And you know, people like, they say, Oh, you know, but he never fought Ali and he never fought these guys that, you know, his era, people weren't as good. Maybe, maybe, but everybody in his era, he fucked up all of them up until spanx, or excuse me until I'm a bust the Hendrix.

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       No. Yup. Well, buster, yeah, buster was the first one to beat him, but I meant uh, holyfield. Yeah, that's how fucked up I am. I said, Hendrix, I was trying to remember what the fight was when holy field, uh, beat Tyson, those two fights in a row like that was, that was big. And when Tyson bid, his ear like that was big. Like the, that was like, when you realize like he's just not, he's not the same guy he was. We both lived in Columbus when buster douglas knocked him out, that was a crazy, like he became the big, big fucking

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       hero. No one knew who he was really. I feel like when I was young, but then he was supposed to take over at the east side of the city. He was gonna to change everything, have a big giant boxing gym and never happened.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       We know the story of Buster Douglas, it's an amazing story. His mom died, his mom died when he was in training for the fight. Oh really? And all of his life, he had kind of been really talented as a boxer, but hadn't really completely dedicated himself to it. So when his mom died, he went completely insane in the gym in preparation for Tyson. And then when it came out that he, it was like two people that had the exact opposite things happen to them for Tyson. He had just been smashed and everybody for so long, he was so good and so scary. He would win fights for the, you could even start, it would just be a matter of whether or not you are going to make it out of the first round. Sometimes he's just smashing people. But for Buster Douglas is like, he had some good fights and some bad fights and it just wasn't, it wasn't completely consistent, but he was talented.

Speaker 2:          01:06:21       But then when his mom died, it was right when the time when Tyson was, you know, just overconfident. He was a 46 to one underdog I think. Is that what it was? It was marketed as Tyson is back fight, which I didn't. Oh Wow. I didn't know that. Tyson is back. I don't remember that. What, um, what were the odds, because I think it was one of the craziest odds of someone who want to fight 42 to one. It says 42 to one is a law. That means you have to be a total sucker to bet on Buster Douglas. But I'll take your money. Stupid. Yeah, yeah. I'll give you $4,200 if you give me a hundred you know, it's like they're so confident that Tyson's going to beat them. They're willing to bet 42 times whatever you're going to put up. That to me is always, I think bets.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       I'm not telling you what to do, but I think bet she'd be like, I think actually I, I take it back. I think it should be able do whatever you want, but I think the real bet should be who do you want? Who Do you think's going to win? It's making it real clear who's going to win. If you say, Oh, well, uh, we'll Michael spanx making out of the first round. Like, all right, now we're getting weird because this is some shit you might be able to effect. Maybe you might be able to talk to Mike and Mike. There's a lot of money in this fight. It was even more if we can get to the second round, you know what I'm saying? Bro Know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          01:07:44       The last bit I liked that was Amanda Nunez. Yeah. Kayo and the second round, like specifically pick that.

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       That's very important to protect against that kind of influence because that Shit's real. That shit's happened throughout sports. If someone comes up to you and goes, look, there's a lot of money if this fight goes into the third round. So we're going to do look at his, the ons 72 to [inaudible] 72 to one. This fight goes to the third round. Know what that means. You let the vine go to the third round and we'll make a lot more more. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:08:10       I heard the, uh, a lot of people were a little worried about the over under for Holly Holm.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Cyborg fight being only one and a half, I think was the over under real or we thought it probably was going to go away longer. That's a probably a gambling thing, right? Is that it has, I think it has to do with the, where the money sits. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:08:28       But is that what he does? I wish we knew. Probably find out. Find out. Exactly. But yeah, I don't, we used to talk to a gambling experts sometimes on the old days of the UFC on spike, there were a guy would come on and he would, uh, he would give us the odds to go local oddsmaker type guy. And he and I would even disagree about shit sometimes. God dammit. I can't remember his name. See if you can remember that gentleman's name.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       I feel terrible. What was that Ugg boot you had on your head? Was that, oh, how dare you. How dare you? It's a, I don't want to mispronounce it. So yeah. Is it like a religious thing or? Um, no, it's uh, from uh, his, his area of Dagestan,

Speaker 2:          01:09:11       they, um, I have it saved here on my thing cause people been asking me, uh, in his area of Dagestan they, um, to where this thing it says, um, it's what a warrior, a mountain clan. There are warrior mountain clan and that this is what they're shepherds were. And this is what you call it. [inaudible]. I don't want to fuck this up, but it looks like it says pop poo pop popup Hoopa. The pub Hoopla. Probably fucking that up, but this is how it's pronounced. I know how to spell it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       You look like that one guy that got arrested for murdering his wife. Was that, what was that? What are you, that old guy, Phil Spector and Phil Spector. Oh, no, that wasn't his wife. Oh, that's hilarious. That's very funny actually. That's strong it strong. Remember that guy you show up for court with these crazy wigs on w was it a wing or was it actually his hair? No, no, you would wig. This is, um,

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       um, this is how you spell it. It's P a. P. A. K. H. A pup. Hookah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:21       Oh God. Look at that hair. Yeah, that's the same, I don't even know if the case, if you don't want announce a kit that's, he actually turned it to the next level. Phil Spector, we're looking at Phil Spector from his murder trial. It was a horrible story. Like Phil Spector. Specter

Speaker 2:          01:10:34       stuck a gun in some chick's mouth. Wow. And killed her. And apparently that was a, something that he had been known to do. He would, he would pull a gun sticking in like an artist's mouth, you know? Do you know that there's a lot of people that think that Jimmy Hendrix manager killed him? Yeah. Yeah. And apparently there's like a guy who wrote a book guy who was a bodyguard or something or another for a, someone in the music business back then claimed that that was a, he wrote, uh, wrote a book about this and claims that's what happened. That Jimi Hendrix, a girlfriend at the time jumped off a building. She committed suicide and they were like, now they threw that girl building.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       It's like, whoa, what's the dirt? Wasn't there a documentary or a movie about it? Was there, I think there might've been, you know, you hear about a guy like Hendrix had died at 27 and you go, Whoa, what, how was that? How was he that good? How the hell is he had a good at 27.

Speaker 5:          01:11:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:33       Fuck man. Imagine if you're still alive. It would be threatening. I saw guns and roses, uh, like a month ago. And uh, earl guide is like right in the front row. They played a three and a half hour show. It was weird seeing him did it. Really? Yeah. It was weird seeing him perform. I tell you that slash still has it that that motherfucker jams three and a half hours is insane. Yeah. What's a normal concert for like aerosmith or some shit? Maybe two hours maybe. Maybe it's a long, it's a long time. Three and a half hours if not four hours. Six hours. Can I get seven? Did I get to heaven? Well he um, he like went to the dark lands and then came back like axl rose's, a weird guy. The key, he vanished and then returned and now they're killing it. It's weird.

Speaker 1:          01:12:27       Remember when he broke his leg and was singing on stage with a uh, with a cast on, on a chair? Yeah. It was weird watching him because when you're that close it's weird seeing things that you normally wouldn't even notice. One thing was after every song he would just go behind this curtain, come out with a different shirt on and he must have changed t shirts maybe like 20 times in outfits. Like you'd have a com. I have a scarf on this one and wow. It's weird. Yeah. That's him with a leg brace on. Yeah. Singing with a leather jacket on.

Speaker 5:          01:13:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:01       It's dual. Pretty bad ass. Who the fuck's ever done that before? And I know, I know Dave Grohl did it while he was performing acts alone. Dumb has didn't really? Yeah, that's hilarious. He loaned him his brace. That's the throne thing. Oh, the throne. He ticks around with them. How long did axle have to sing on that thing for a couple of months, I think. Wow. That's crazy. Girls, squads, people. How amazing it was. Dave's and that he loaned attack, so I'm sorry. Oh, other way around. Well that's both bad ass equally bad ass. Either way. You do it either way. You pop it back and forth. What were you saying, Brian? How bad ass is Dave grohl doubt. Like he, he was the drummer for Nirvana and then totally chicken created the foo fighters right after Nirvana. And it's one of the best bands ever, you know, and he's now not even playing drums anymore. Was he playing drums for Nirvana? Yeah, he was the drummer for Nevada and now he's saying, well, you know, kind of like, yeah, I could do anything. When drummer that you're an guitars of the year separate, separate, separate bands and he's a bad motherfucker. Yeah, for sure. I love the female writers. No, never him once. I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          01:14:15       Um, I met one of the other guys in Nirvana. Who's the other gentleman? Uh, Pat smear or are you got the guy who flies planes? I met him at one of the marijuana policy project, which basically, yeah, that gentleman really guitar up and it fell and hit him in the head during the mistakes. Musical words. Oh fuck man. That's terrible. I remember when the old days when people would smash guitars on stage. I was like a big deal. Trent reznor used to do it every, I mean, what the fuck is that about man? What was that about? What was this whole destroying musical instruments thing about [inaudible] man, we got to break it all down. How much trash is fucking guitar, dude, dude, dude, smash slash fuck. You didn't have any money. And you just imagine if you could get Jimi Hendrix Guitar. Did he smash guitars? No. What do you think? I got it right here at the first person to do it, or at least credited with, let me think. 1960 so I'm still only hand Jimi Hendrix burned his guitar. Yeah, he burned it.

Speaker 6:          01:15:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:15:20       I'd say the first person wouldn't be like, yeah, I feel like he smashed it to, yeah, I would say he's smashed guitars. Hidden. He smash at Jamie. I don't know that he didn't add up. I'll look up hendricks just for sure, but I got the guy that, the first guy who's got, who was the first coffee towns in it. Oh, of course. That's right. That's right. Pete towns and do it. You know what? I might be fucking this up. Jimmy Hendrix might not have smashed guitar. It might've just been townsend didn't someone and kiss that ace freely of her smash guitars. Here's Monterey pop festival. Like Jimmy lit it on fire and smashed it. Oh Man. He was high as fuck. Yeah, just hitting everything.

Speaker 6:          01:15:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       Some weak ass lambs. He got to work on your, oh no, I know. Oh yeah. He can't move in those fucking pants, those pants, man. These tickets constrict your deck. So I know these guys had kids. Lenny Kravitz, his pants ripped open. Yeah, that's right. Long for [inaudible] death. Hank can fly. Jimi Hendrix was, uh, he was wearing those, those are jeans, like jeans, that tight man. You can't do shit in those things. You definitely can't smash guitars correctly.

Speaker 6:          01:16:29       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:16:30       so he smashed guitars a bunch of times.

Speaker 6:          01:16:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       yeah, yeah. This has to go to the feeling of the music you're getting, man. You just get into it. Yeah. Plus you're on acid, right? Yeah. Also, he's on acid a lot during this time. It wasn't any, wow, look at this. They just let him smash these things. Here's a guitar sacrifice. So like a guy like Matt, thea mortal Brown and Jimi Hendrix swing that guitars like just needs a little coaching. He used to like, that's like a big exercise they use with macy's and shit. You know, that's like hitting tires with sledgehammers. That's an excellent form of exercise. Now try to find nickelback smashing guitars. Not going to happen. Maybe I'm going to be on nickelback.

Speaker 7:          01:17:10       I don't, I don't think they're bad but I, I accept that you don't like it. I just feel like as I move into 2018 I want to spend more time positive on things I like. Then things I don't like and more time. If there are things that I don't like, I want to be able to look at them in a more relaxed manner and it'd be less, less engaged with it and more, more just as long as you're not hurting anybody, just have fun. Who gives a shit?

Speaker 3:          01:17:43       Do you read about Will Ferrell? Uh, he did a uh, rose parade. They acted the eight, he dressed up in a character with this other girl that used to be on Saturday night live. They acted like local, like news people doing like showing the parade and they broadcast it live on Amazon prime and people thought it was real. They didn't read. A lot of people didn't even realize it was will ferrell. And so like people are like angry

Speaker 7:          01:18:07       about it cause they didn't get the joke. Oh my God. That's hilarious. He shaved his head. He's got prosthetic on or something. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. That is amazing. As fictional local TV hosted dual made jokes about the parades, marching bands, flower covered floats and inaccurate historical uniforms. Oh my gosh.

Speaker 3:          01:18:26       Yeah. I guess you can get it on Amazon prime right now. And I guess there was so many one stars and all the reviews are like, how dare they. This is a tradition.

Speaker 7:          01:18:35       Oh my God. That's hilarious. These local news people. That is so funny. That's so funny. Will Ferrell's fucking anybody who says will Ferrell's not funny. I can't talk to over 1,001 stars on it. Yeah, I just can't. I can't talk to anybody who doesn't think that guys hilarious. Yeah, there's certain, see I just contradicted what I said earlier. You don't have, you can like whatever you want. I don't care. Meanwhile I'm like, except Will Ferrell. Fuck for me. Towel. Dig In nights, man, when he's running around in his underwear, he's saying, Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft. I'm crying,

Speaker 3:          01:19:06       you know, that's based off a real thing. If him running out thinking he's on fire because there was a famous car like, like what's that petroleum where it's like, uh, you can't see petroleum when it's on fire at petroleum fire. It's clear or it's invisible. And so this famous race car driver. Yeah. If there was a fire in his car but you couldn't see it. So He's like, I'm on fire. But to everyone else it looked like he was just a crazy person. I think this might be it. I see like all these people are on fire right now and he can't even tell uh, there there's a fire. Oh Wow. Cause Petroleum fire, you can't see, Whoa, what? Yeah. Oh my God, I didn't know that whole seat. No, this,

Speaker 7:          01:19:57       yeah, you can't not see trillium firing can only see at night. Oh my God, that is insane.

Speaker 3:          01:20:04       So all these people are on fire and they're running from invisible fire. Oh my

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       God. How am I just now learning this? You can't see petroleum fire. Is that real? Yeah. You only at night there has to be really dark cause it's like this, the light blue part of it. Oh my God, get any orange or anything so fucked. But how hilarious is it that was based on a real and so he has flame retardant clothes on so that stuff doesn't catch fire. Right. This is a skin. It's getting it. Oh my God. Oh my God. How are [inaudible]? And it got into the crowd too. Like people are like, why is everyone freaking out? Oh here's another radio lab plug. I was listening this thing about ball lightning. I sit here right now, he'll catch it on fire and uh, see how much fire, Ooh. So that's your nose. See like right there. You can't tell it's on fire right there. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:21:03       That's insane. That's insane dude. Oh my God. He just dropped something in it instantly caught fire.

Speaker 1:          01:21:10       Wow. That's why petroleum fires are a dangerous for firemen and stuff like that. Cause you can't see, how do I not know that? I can't believe I woke up today on January 2nd, 2018 I learned that for the first time. I should have known that I'm not woke, not vogue. That's Hashtag not woke that you're a Hashtag blessed Hashtag blessed but not Hashtag woke up today. I didn't know about petroleum fires.

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       It's crazy that you could just buy a lighter. You know what? Talk about like what's the possibility of people being fucked up it way less than you think because like lighters are everywhere and this relatively few fires in comparison to the number of lighters. You know, like everybody's got a fucking lighter. Everybody we know has a lighter and was the last time someone window let, let some shit on fire. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:22:06       It is weird. It's weird. It's weird. But like the real weirdness about driving cars is how few accidents there are. That's the real weirdness. Of course, it's going to be some and more so with these fucking assholes on their phones. God Damn. I've been seeing some drifters. Some people drift in lanes and texting while they're driving. Holy Shit. That's common.

Speaker 2:          01:22:29       But take that away. And it's remarkable how rarely we slam into each other. It's remarkable. You can go years without a car accident if you're careful. Years and years and years.

Speaker 6:          01:22:39       Fuck man.

Speaker 2:          01:22:42       Can I say in this city? Yeah, some remarkable, but you know they happen. They definitely happen. There's no way right now they can tell exactly what you were doing. They just know what happened. But if there's a way that they can put one of those scent, you know how they have, don't they have onstar now and a lot of cars you buy him like from the factory and they have that onstar thing where you, you could actually like have comp calls, like make phone calls with the whatever it is on the other line. Like you could say, hey can you book me a reservation at restaurant? Like they're also monitoring how fast your car's going. They're monitoring like certain certain metrics, certain things they could figure out like what happened when you were causing an accident? Where'd you go? Where'd you drive to? Like if they could track you and GPS and at a certain point in time they're going to be like, why can't we just film him? This is going to film you all the time inside your car. And like if you want to drive a cadillac, don't have any fucking orgies in it

Speaker 1:          01:23:46       cause it's great cause we have to film you because otherwise we're never going to know what the fuck you did to cause his car accident. We don't want to get sued. Ultima bail is the ultimate bill has the camera. So like if you're doing the lane departure setting, it detects if you're not paying attention. So then by tracking your face, so there's a camera and I think it's oldsmobiles now. Wow. Well that's sort of like the iphone x or 10 right? It sees your face, recognize your face to open up your a password and it works pretty fucking good. It's not perfect, but it's like whoa. It's a lot better than I thought it was going to be a lot smoother. I got this phone when I couldn't find my glasses and I found them the other day and I have a beard now and add a stocking hat on, still unlocks it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       It's like how the hell does it go through all those things. What would change if someone gained or lost weight? Would anything change? I don't think so. I think the texts like how far your eyes are a part, you know, and like little things like that. Like I think my, what's weird is I have a Amazon Echo in my next to my bed now cause it's like the best alarm clock average. Like it's one of those things where you go like Alexa, you know, and uh, but it has a camera on it. Yeah. It's watching them for sure. Yeah. Nice. Is watching your your whole life. I'm like keep an eye on me Alexa. Every time you beat off Alexa makes a checkmark right next to you. It is weird though. Like we'll be just sleeping all the night and Alexa will just be like, I can't understand what you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:25:11       And you're like, well I didn't say anything. Luxembourg. She'll just start coming to life. She's starting to wake up, she's becoming more woke. To me the best is if you go Alexa rap and does this wrap, it's could do a wrap and it's a good rap. Yeah. We were talking before the podcast, there was a, uh, it's a good rap. We were talking before the podcast is there was something about an apple buying Netflix when Jesus, yeah. How do you feel about a company that gets that big? Like how do you feel about like any company that does a buys up everything, you know, they just, Disney, Disney bought up star wars. What else? They buy out. Didn't they just buy the other movie studio owns, uh, the avengers or whatever. A pmr. Paramont I dunno. I don't know if there were a lot of money. $52 billion to buy 21st century. Yeah. So now like the Marvel Universe is complete I think now is it bad?

Speaker 2:          01:26:10       Is it bad to have giant companies? Some people would say yes. Right? What about a giant company? Like Google seems to be a pretty God damn good company. Like as far as like the way they treat people, it's supposed to be like pretty good. Other than that James Damore memo thing, that the thing that went out, remember that that whole, uh, where the guy was talking about why there aren't women in tech and what would encourage them. And a lot of people said he was sexist and it got crazy and I was like, then I had to read it like a couple of times ago. It's like one or two things. It might be misconstrued as being sexist because of the term neuroticism and he, I think he believes, I believe he uses the term neurotic but really super duper controversial fucking thing and although I don't agree with it, Google firing the guy, I kind of get it. I get where they are just to kind of calm everyone's nerves. I don't, I don't agree with that at all, but I understand why they as a corporation would think that way, but for the most part I seem to, I like what they're doing. Like they're, they're buying up all these robotics and these different corporations that are creating the google. Didn't Google buy up Boston

Speaker 1:          01:27:15       dynamics already sold it though. Yeah, they sold it. They bought it and then sold it. Still all the secrets. Interesting. I wonder if that's what they do because you don't hear about the sale when they get rid of something like that. Yeah. Purchase requisite. Yeah. You sell it and then you make sure that you don't sign some sort of uh, you know, noncompete clause and could have often done it to buy a purse and there might've been someone working there they wanted to have on their team. And so they just, ah, well by your whole company now you work for us. Whoa, that's some fucking game of thrones type shit with silicone. Disney was smart, Dubai, Hulu because they just pulled all their stuff off and Netflix, all Disney, I think Disney often flood and now they're just going to put it all on Hulu, which is awesome cause I left Hulu. But here's the thing,

Speaker 2:          01:27:54       question, like is that, is it, is it possible to be as big as Google and not be scary? Right. And when something gets so big that the controls so much, people like tend to just immediately get wary. Like whoa, like this is the whole market, right? If there's only one way you can get the Internet for verizon was the only Internet provider on planet earth, that's it. We'd be like, Hey, that just you, just you. So if that's that because it's too big, right. Controls too much.

Speaker 1:          01:28:28       It's like what's the level we're comfortable with apple, with apple? It depends on the company also, I think, you know, like I think a lot of people trust Google and apple. Apple put the nets over the buildings when the people were jumping and did the right thing. She didn't think with the batteries they did the response. I got to see that battery thing is crazy. We got to talk about that. How many years ago did we start talking about who called? You called it in like whatever the first year of the fucking knew it was when they had a new iphone and then the new, uh, new new iphone. As soon as the new new iphone came out, you

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       were like, I know what these mother fuckers are doing.

Speaker 3:          01:29:04       Yeah. But I get their excuse and it wasn't like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:29:06       to lock. It might've been like two I phones and I want to be honest about this. I don't remember. I don't remember. But I remember there was a time that you called it first way before everybody else. I was like, Brian's all paranoid about technology.

Speaker 3:          01:29:19       I understand their excuse. So I get what they're saying. I mean there, if the batteries are going to start failing because it's,

Speaker 2:          01:29:26       you can't have the is all fucked up in a battery. But to deny that they know that the throttling down of performance of the phone's not going to influence people into deciding, deciding to buy a new phone is ridiculous. Yeah, you are. You are literally disabling the phone. You're, and you're not doing your customer service base. You're not doing them a service. Because if you were, if you really cared about them getting the best stuff all the time, what you would do is he would say, Hey, um, these batteries are going to get older. If you want to continue your phones, here's a new battery to reasonable rate other wise, we have to throttle down the performance of your phone so that you can get a day's use out of it. But that can be avoided by simply swapping out the battery. So this is what happens when your phone gets to be a year old yet

Speaker 3:          01:30:18       that, that's sort of disingenuous. Right. And the batteries were so expensive. Now I think they got them down to $29

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       but that's just in response to getting in this situation right now. I think they make amazing shit. This iphone 10 x, whatever the fuck they want to call it. It's amazing. It's like, it's crazy that there's a company that makes something like that. They're going to make some mistakes. I don't know who approved that mistake, but that's a mistake. They shouldn't have done that. But the stuff they make is, it's someone's got to do that. It's not going to be like the Brian and Joe Corporation. Right. You know? I mean you need something with massive resources and a ton of shit fuck ton of people to be able to put together the cash to make an iphone 10 I mean this, you got to hire a lot of fucking people to make this thing right. You got a higher wizards and sorcerers and God damn silicone geniuses and people know how to get lithium ion batteries thinner than your fucking fingernail in these things. Nothing in your fingernail. Right at the end of that, a finger. What's like, how thick is a, well, it can't be that thick. The shit has a case on it. Like how thin is a a battery and a cell phone? It's a pretty thin like paper chip or a potato chip rather like a flat potato. If you ever could flatten out a potato chip,

Speaker 3:          01:31:40       it's a little thicker than that. Actually. What's crazy though is that I, the the phone before this iphone seven plus s whatever the fuck it was, when we owe debt, when I download the new operating system on it, it was crashy. It was buggy. It fucked up all the time. But then when I got the iphone x, the same operating system, it worked way better. So that's like not anything to do with the battery, you know, that's just because they build an operating system around this processor and this screen and all the components on this and then they're emulating it for all the other phones, you know, or whatever they're doing. It's almost like

Speaker 2:          01:32:14       the only way to be truly awesome at something. That's just to be greedy too. It's like they got to have like, we'll get a fuel this motherfucker. Okay, okay. This is, this is projected, uh, sales and we can get that up to about 20%. And this is how we're going to do it. Do you have the dark secret meetings where they can just add candles? Went into the fucking basement. Nicole, we're to slow down the old phones. No, don't do it. Mark watching for technology. We've always worked for technology and we can't slow down the fucking phones, man. We're gonna slam down vessel. I'm down selling the new shit. They don't need the new shit.

Speaker 6:          01:32:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       It's about information more than it's about new apps.

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       You've been watching Black Mirror.

Speaker 2:          01:32:56       I only watched three episodes, but I love it. You haven't watched the new season of watched. Uh, I think one episode in the new season, which was the video game episode, but the guy was in the life video game that was remarkably similar to Arusha fears. Salvia divinorum trip. I was done no new season as of like two days ago. Here's another new days ago. Oh, I know. I can't, I don't have the time for this. Uh, but the, the last one I watched was the video game one. Um, I'm hooked on the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt right now on Netflix. Have you watched it? Dude? That is a funny, silly show. Oh yeah, I have seen that. Yeah. The lady, she was trapped in a bunker for 15 years for in a religious cult and she gets out and she's living in New York City and she doesn't know what the fuck's going on. It's really funny, man. There's a couple of episodes were kind of falls apart, but then it bounces back strong. It's very funny again now. It's a really good show. I'm on like episode, uh, I want to say eight. I think I'm on episode eight.

Speaker 3:          01:33:53       Black Mirror is getting into some trouble cause I guess Carl, you know Carl pink pig crow. Pinkerton. Yeah. Supposedly two things. I am two different episodes. He talks about something that they stole in Black Mirror and ou, which is weird. It was in the news today.

Speaker 2:          01:34:08       Um hmm. Well, I don't know what the specifics are, so I don't want to comment, but um, there's a lot of things that black mirror did his subjects that I talked about too, but it was just because a lot of people were talking about potential future technologies, like this video game thing where they put something in the back of your head, like the Matrix and plug you into some artificial experience that's indistinguishable. That's what those, I've talked about that a hundred times just from being high, you know, and thinking about what are they going to be able to do next that's crazier than a Duncan trussell when he had that htc vive, you put that thing on. Did you put the thing on I halfway? Oh, you have one? Yeah. Dunkin. A hangover is podcasts and I put it off for like an hour and a half before I did it. We, you do just do you do that and you go, okay, well what's next? You know, so I don't know if Carl just was able to figure out what's next or are they saying this plagiarism?

Speaker 1:          01:35:01       Yeah. I mean if, if, uh, if the, you have the article, Jamie, if, uh, it seems pretty specific where it's not like, hey, let's tease talking about simulation. Teary. It's more like, oh, he actually had this idea. I forget what it is. I saw it this morning. Sometimes though it is parallel thinking. So let's just in the interest of this spoiler alerts in there, I don't even want to read. Okay, well watch Karl Pink and predict new Black Mirror plots years ahead of time. Yeah, you're right. We can't, we can't bring these out. So, uh, who, who wrote the article, what's it on? Gizmodo. I love that. Very good site. Yeah. And gadgets. Very good sight. He real news. Do you have like five websites that you just shuffle back and forth? Like, like Gizmodo is one in gadgets when Kotaku is one. I just signed this one who scientist. People get mad, but I like to read the New York Times. New York Times. He would get mad. You're like read fake news. It's the fucking New York Times. Okay. You cannot just immediately dismissed the fucking New York Times. You cannot with any mistakes that anybody has made ever. You cannot fucking dismiss the New York Times.

Speaker 2:          01:36:09       How dare you. They're a giant part of what made people at this level in terms of our understanding of world events, a giant part leading to 2017 like if you look at the history of human beings, understanding the reality of a, a detailed intellectual understanding of the reality of certain current world events compiled in a daily resource. The New York Times change the world. It offered people super high level information from Uber Smart people on a regular basis and to dismiss that and say that that's just as good as any other papers that no, no, no. There's a is a pursuit. What they were in, they were in a pursuit for excellence in information. Now, whether or not they've made some mistakes to, I criticized him for that. Conor mcgregor weird thing that they said is his face was covered in blood and he was,

Speaker 1:          01:37:11       and they fixed it immediately. Yeah. They said he'd be almost fell

Speaker 2:          01:37:13       through the ropes before the rescue. The referee rescued them like, I won't eat it. You don't have to. He got his ass kicked. You have to make anything up like that. What happened was amazing. You don't have to embellish it just to make your magazine. This is crazy. Like you can't do that. You're the New York Times, like in, especially in this day and age, you got to resist and you gotta be, I'm rubber. You're glue. You can't even respond. You can't and you can't put out anything fake. You just can't, you know? But people that go, oh, the New York Times is fake news. Like they've been around for so long. Do you know how much important shit they put out? If you're going to just dismiss them because you love trump, is that you're really willing to do that. That's, that's as crazy as anything I've ever heard. You can't do that. Like they can't be exonerated. I mean, they can be exonerated, but they can't be exempt from not being called out by printing something. That's not true. They, everyone should be held up the same standards. But if you don't appreciate what the, The New York Times has done, that seems crazy to me. It's just they're really important.

Speaker 4:          01:38:15       Could you see all the trump like global warming tweets? Like he doesn't really understand global warming. He's trolling scientist wake up freezing right now. Global warming's not real. He's 70 and he's, he's trolling. Yeah. It's weird, right? It's true. I wish the whole thing was a trawl. That'd be so fucking know. He's trolling about that though.

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       You know, he just doesn't want anybody fucking with them and he feels like a lot of the mainstream media, they fuck with them. And so he fires back and then it becomes this weird thing where all the people that are on his side started like they, you know, they pick people, pick sides man. And they're like fake news food news. Like, no, it's The New York Times. It's not. It's the one of the best news sources ever have. They said, shit, that's not true. 100% you know why they're run by people. People fuck up everywhere. There's not a place where they go where they don't fuck up every fucking place a person goes. They fuck up. They fuck up in Harvard, they fuck up in mit. They just fuck up way less than most of us. There's still just people.

Speaker 5:          01:39:19       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       Since W it's weird time right now. So we're weird time right now as far as uh, the way people are looking at things,

Speaker 5:          01:39:27       you know,

Speaker 2:          01:39:30       just seems everything's, it seems very exaggerated. A group preparing for something like we're screaming baby war North Korea, North Korea. But here's the other thing, North Korea just made a speech recently where they were actually open to high level talks and there were, there are, there are more. It was way more passive and less threatening. Yeah. And people like this crazy motherfucker might realize trump is a crazy motherfucker too, who actually runs the u s and unlike Obama who would probably never consider a attacking North Korea, he's looking at trump. He's like, this dude is 70. Okay, he's old as fuck. He's been a gangster his whole life. And now he just took over the country and he left the military guys do whatever the fuck they want to do. You don't think there's a high possibility that some of those spaceships from Nevada might come out of a hole in the ground and go rocketing towards North Korea in 20 minutes and let loose some crazy new bombs that you haven't even heard of yet. That's entirely possible. He knows it. I don't like to think there's any benefit to our current situation.

Speaker 4:          01:40:41       Well, we offer just cut off all their with a gas. Yeah. Yeah. There's some serious sanctions, so that might be why he's telling you guys. Right. That's actually probably more logical. Yeah, but I'm doing more of

Speaker 1:          01:40:53       the comic book thing. It's like people don't want to piss trump off. It's interesting, you know? Yeah, it makes sense. He's like, he's definitely nuttier than the regular dude. He's definitely not nothing other than the regular dude that's in the job.

Speaker 3:          01:41:09       I thought we were getting an attack the other day when that space x launch happen, like that was, well, everyone at starbucks, I said starbucks, everyone at starbucks started running out and I was like, oh my God, what's going on? Like is there a bomb? Like I was kind of freaked out. Then everyone's like staring at the sky so I run out and first I thought it was an alien because I that pulsating smoke that was happening on the side, like I'd never seen anything like that before. It was like, wait my eyes, I've never seen that before because it was like, it looked like a big whale. Then there was like a.in the middle of it that was pulsating, like smoke rings almost and it just looked foreign. It looked like an alien, but then everyone's like, is that Korea? And I'm like, I didn't even think about North Korea. Like is that headed downtown? I saw one of those ones

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       melrose, it was a a launch at Edwards air force base. They launched something like some missile test. I was like, Whoa, you saw this thing shooting across the sky. People are pulling their cars over. This is a long time ago. And they did it like right at dusk, right as the sun was setting and they shot. I think they thought they'd get away with it. They could sneak it in there before we could see it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:12       It's, it's weird that they do that. Like there was a lot of car accidents when that happened because everyone thought, what the fuck? Where are we getting attack? It's weird that they don't like, you know how your phone goes off if Pablo gets kidnapped by his Stepdad, you know you have that, the android, but they want to say, hey, there's going to be a big rocket launch. Jamie, what does this the one from last week? Ah, look at their dish. That is crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:42:37       Oh my God. Oh my God. That is crazy. And it's, it's going around the earth and off into, fuck, it's shooting off three on Friday night. So just, here's your warning. Don't forget fries. Oh, we're going to be sure. When is the one where um, he shoots a tesla to Mars. When's he doing that? It's coming up soon. I think that's what the thing on Friday. It was supposed to got pushed from Friday to Friday, from Thursday and it's setting up the next, the big launch, which I think is that word. Has there ever been a god? It's more like Tony Stark. Then you on musk. Never. He's awesome. You think he's sending his car away so he can go get it? Like he's going to be the first one out of here. Take my car with me. I won't let them go. You got to stay. Do we need you down here?

Speaker 1:          01:43:23       You might not make it back. What if your calculations are off? What if your calculations are off? Like you know sometimes people were saying they get up the Tesla and the door handle doesn't open up automatically and then you don't even have a door handle like, okay, what if that happens when you're up there bro? Yeah. Huh? Never. We never had a super genius that everybody wants to just hand the keys to before. What if he is the Bitcoin guy too? That some people think, some people think he created bitcoin. Yeah. Shit. I have to ask Mr Antonopoulos if he agrees with that. I don't believe that. That's why don't you? Because that would be too crazy. He could have been done a two crazy what? He's an alien. What if he's the future? He's dating Johnny Depp's acts. He can't be too close. Broke up with her bro. Go for him. He brought it to the comic store one night. Oh, that's right dude. I gotta think

Speaker 2:          01:44:10       that there's levels to everything and they might be even levels in the super genius category and he's in some weird new, crazy ultra productive level of the super genius category. Did he, he powered what, what part of New Zealand was at or something like that with that gigantic, was it Australia? It was Australia. He made some sort of a bet where he would install some mega battery complex in Australia. Am I remembering this right? And uh, it worked perfectly in record time. See, Tesla built a giant battery to fight power outages in Australia and it's already working and it worked in like milliseconds. Like the power went down and it kicked on in milliseconds only last three years before it starts at 0.14 seconds. That's insane. After a major plant, the Loy Yang sang a station in the neighboring state of Victoria suffered a sudden drop in output. That's amazing. It kicked in just 0.14 seconds after the thing went out. The thing. Nothing. Yeah, man. He's a wizard. He's, he's some sort of new type of a cultural figure like the, the Electronic Daddy. He's the guy's making cars. He's going to build autonomous. Uh, what are those a transporter trucks. Gigantic semi trucks. The boring company. Yeah, the boring company.

Speaker 1:          01:45:44       He's going to fix traffic. Why is it just keeps going? Why is he a tackle? Things like cancer. Herpes figured out on your own bit. Busy making electric cars. The fuck. What do you, why don't you fix it? I'm doing this. I made a car. I made a car. I'm shooting one of my cars to the Mars. You want to come when to watch? I think he's got like, he's got to have two or three friends that are sort of like, what do you guys want to do this month? What are we going to fix or fuck with? Or He's too smart to have friends. He's got a couple of people that he observes. It's got to have a buddy. He bounces some shit off of it as an alien. You don't think the buddy would go, just talk to Johnny Depp. If you got a real buddy, I'd be like, listen,

Speaker 2:          01:46:26       seems amazing. And who she's probably telling the truth. I don't know. I don't know who's right, who's wrong. Well, I just, I want you to be happy bro.

Speaker 1:          01:46:36       I don't want craziness. And you like, she just got off of doing coke and jumping out of windows and Harris freaking out. What do I do? Yeah, I, uh,

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       there's levels to the super genius game and he's some new level. He's like some new, uh, Mike Tyson Punch out character. Like, Whoa, like this is the new super genius inventor level, but that's also a super famous person. Like everybody knows who Elon Musk is. He's almost like a character. Like if you wanted proof that there's some sort of a really super complex but captivating narrative about being a person 2018 he's a central character.

Speaker 1:          01:47:22       Was He smart? His whole life? Like was, he's creating things in like middle school and high score digital. One day out of nowhere, this guy comes back. Oh, I invented it itself. Stuff. Yeah, I'm smart. That's a good question. Maybe it is all off rouge. It's a good question. It's really just foxconn. What if he's the first robot?

Speaker 7:          01:47:37       What if they sent him to like we, we get him a run for president. He went and then, uh, on TV cuts open his arm and he shows you circuitry. It's like, robots need love too. I helped you guys a fixture, whole fucking world. That's the way

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       he made a computer game when he was 12. Dao, te normal doom, doom, vr. Have you played that? Yeah. It's very disturbing to know those people that have that much smarter than you. Right? And you go, well, right? Being, here's the thing, like

Speaker 7:          01:48:11       people are better than you at shit. You got to get over that. There's just no way around it. You know? Imagine if you like Elon Musk's older brother and you, you know, you're like, Bro, you don't know shit. You're only seven. And he's like, okay. It just brews up inside of them. Grows, grows in power. Then what do you do? Even if you're happy, even when you have a great life, like even if you're like, you know, what do I do? Oh, um, I make log furniture, you know, like for outside for the patio. I mean some of the people's fondest moments you're sitting on the back patio and um, I just, it seems kind of old fashioned to me and one of the old fashioned things that I like, his log furniture, so I build log outside patio furniture. My Name's Michael. Michael Mosque. Yeah. I'm super happy. Couldn't be happier. Yeah. Yeah. He's my brother. Ha Ha. Yeah. You line, he's a, let me tell you something. Elan's on speed. Okay. He lands on adderall and provigil and nuvigil and he's taking micro doses. He microdosing he's not clean test him shit.

Speaker 1:          01:49:27       He's got a brother Kimbal Musk, elon musk. He's a super genius that exists in the Lotus position. Floats in midair and some wheat silo somewhere in New Hampshire. And they go visit them a couple of times a month. I wouldn't mind, I would be like, give me a free test every couple of days. They probably got that dude in the bunker with Dick Cheney right now. Kimbal musk. Yeah. I want to know what Kimble does. He teaches Kung Fu. He's in those videos that are always posted on instagram. He's just imagine if his brother was just a nut. Oh look at him. Handsome bastard shrinking coffee. Oh my age. 45 regional manager for blockbuster video. Oh, he's from South Africa. Even crazier. So Ellen's from South Africa to wow. If they could have started at a company called Zip two and sold it to compaq and that's where he started. South Africa is a interesting place.

Speaker 1:          01:50:22       Very, very interesting place. A lot of people I know that go there, love it. And I'm obviously the crazy history with Nelson Mandela and apartheid and how recent that was to us. But I always think of a, that sugar man movie. When I think of South Africa now, I always think of district nine. Doesn't it look like district nine there? Um, the movie with the robots standard or no? No, district nine was the movie with the aliens are aliens. No, they weren't robots. Right. They were like weird aliens. What were they? I think some, that sort of thing of both. Honestly. It was like some sort of tech alien. Oh, that's right. Can you show it again? That was a great fucking movie. I love that. Maybe it's one of my favorites. Oh, that's right. Yeah. They were like some sort of Matt goodness. Yeah, that's right, man. Fuck. That was a good move. A to rewatch it. I think it was shot in South Africa. I think that's where he's from. They've got it made it neill. Blomkamp. Yeah. Um, what was the movie I said that it made me remind me of, uh, what did I just say? Didn't eat. I heard it, but it's not registered. I don't, God dammit.

Speaker 6:          01:51:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:36       Aye d aunt word is always a big connection. I always think about them, but I was saying it was Nelson Mandela. There was something else that made me think about South Africa. I'll come back to it. Oh, that Alysia movie. That was the Matt Damon Movie. Was that in South Africa? Yes. I think it's sort of similar topic as district nine. Yeah. Day Man. It's crazy that a guy like elon musk's, something super duper fucking genius would come out of that spot.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       And what's that plays like let's do a jre in South Africa to alive. Jre cause one with the great whites. Fuck that. That's true. Right? That's a scary spot. Like I'm here. When you fly over me and you're playing, they jump up and try to bite the plane that's bought man. You want to talk about spots South Africa like Dutch colonists trying to like carve out a place in the, in the, in the land in Africa. What do you got me here? The boys in South Africa. Oh No. Gotten a zebra suit and went out and but lions fuck with them.

Speaker 1:          01:52:52       We had Steve O on the kill Tony last night for the weigh ins. Is this an a game preserve though as I remember them? Hey actually telling a story on here. I think that the shot the line part here and La, the reason why I ask is there's plays they have placed in South Africa where they let the lions loose or not. Like they, they know when to let them loose. Like it's kind of a, Oh, Jesus Christ. The lions actually tried to get him. Yeah. Oh No. Oh my God. That's insane. The lions took away their hat. The Zebra head, dude, that is so crazy. They're lucky they lived, they did the dumbest stuff on that show. Yeah. That really was, he's had more than one experiences with lines then because I thought the one that he had in the tree was the only one he ever had.

Speaker 1:          01:53:37       Does that Steevo right there, that Brit, he's crazy. I had drinks with him. Everlast Eddie Bravo want to 80 students and uh, steve o's girlfriend were all hanging around and um, steve was telling me like all these different things that he's about to do. And I was like, why? I'm like, why are you doing that? He's showing me the scars that he had on his arm from the operations where he had to, uh, what's going on here? She's got a book, he's Bait for shark. He put a hook to his lip and then jumped out in the water with sharks that, oh my God, no cage just jumped in the water with a hook in his mouth. His latest one where he got burnt his back and everything. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. He, um, he had a bunch of different, uh, skin graphs from cadavers.

Speaker 1:          01:54:32       That's so crazy that he looks good now though. So I'm last night. He does. He's shown him, put him, he's planning on more chaos. He's not like you always going to go. You're done. You're fine. You could walk. Everything's fine. Let's just end this. Nope. It's like evil knievel. That guy never stopped. Right. I think he's way less busted up and evil knievel evil knievel lived in the days where, you know, they, the medicine was not as good, but he also was flying motorcycles and shit. Wait, different weight, evil knievel was jumping rockets across canyons. Remember that? Snake River Canyon, is that what it was? Where was that? In Arizona or some shit. What do you remember that he had a rocket. He shot across a canyon.

Speaker 6:          01:55:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:17       Those, uh, those guys that climb those uh, skyscrapers and stuff. Did you see the guy that fell that was this creepy video to watch horrifying video to watch? Scary. Horrifying. Yeah. That, that's um, encouraging that is not wise, but discouraging it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       I've seen a lot of those videos. Right. I've watched a lot of them. I had a, what is his name? Okay. Could we have in the show super strong fingers. James Kingston, King James Kingston, who was a very nice guy who has done a lot of things online that it freaked me the fuck out and he was really nice guy. I don't want to tell that guy. He can't do something that I enjoyed watching that he succeeded in doing. I don't, I don't want them to land on me either. You know, it's like, I mean, how much time and effort have you done in to cleaning up the bottom area where you might fall because you're going to fall if you fall out. Okay. I'm not saying you're going to fall, but if you fall you might fall on somebody. Okay, this is different. Fuck this. This is not good

Speaker 8:          01:56:27       for me. I can't even know why I came in. A Lot's changed. Don't put this off. Oh gotta get down. We've got to get down from here. We gotta get that back. Got To get done

Speaker 2:          01:56:39       del slow and they'll stop. Don't do work at the top. We got away with it. We got away with it.

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       Just thinking it's not in the interest of full disclosure. We got way too high before the show who legal weed. That's why you know what it is. Um, also that, um, that fucking, um, the weed that we used to have before

Speaker 2:          01:57:04       sober October and the weed after sober October is different, different stuff. And I think the combination of those two things, a combination of taking a month off and then trying some new different stuff. There's different stuff. It's different.

Speaker 1:          01:57:20       Yeah. But your tolerance also restarted. Yeah. It's not good right now. Sketchy. You gotta be careful. I've got to gingerly, gingerly walked into the waters one month. Cleanses you. Oh yeah. It cleanses you. It's amazing how fast it cleanses. Like three days. If I haven't smoked in three days and I spoke a joint, I'm like so stoned out of my gourd. I still can't remember what I wanted to say about South Africa. I knew it had something to do with a apartheid and the struggle in that area and how strange it is. African itself. What's that? Chappy chappy. Oh, there was another movie and has a decent word one. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. That wasn't as good. Deanna word came out strong. They're interesting that Yolanda, Yolanda, Yolanda, Yolanda, Yolanda foster. How do you say her name?

Speaker 1:          01:58:14       Oh, lanny. How'd he say it? I think it's your lanny. Yolanda. Yolanda. Yolanda. Yolanda. Yolanda. Visser. That's it. Yolandi visser reminds me of like, Bingo. Yeah. What movie was that? Chappy? Hmm. Do you know that day? Uh, they were like, you know, they're like the main characters in the movie, but they said something or they to the, about the director or the studio. They did, they got in a fight. So they took them off the poster and everything. That's why they're not on any of the posters, even though they're like main characters. Fortunate. Yeah. That sucks. See, that's why people like Deanwood, they're little too raw. They need like a, um, a slick talking manager and we're doing, we're, we're dealing with artists here. Ultimately they don't really mean what they say. It's just the same explosive nature that lives inside. Then let some create such amazing music that you're a fan of and I'm a fan off.

Speaker 1:          01:59:10       Sometimes it gets haywire and he would just like to come in and apologize for bitch slapping you, telling you to suck his dick was all wrong. Yeah. They, I mean they didn't even market it. That dmt word was in it. That's crazy. Yeah, that seems like a mistake. It seems like you don't like money, but who knows? Who knows what they're really like, you know, that would be the big bummer. Right? You meet him in their dicks mean and hung out with them. It really smelled like armpits. Who's armpits though? Some people's armpits smell lovely. It's like that one year you took deodorant. It wasn't a whole year. It's like a week to seem like it here. Cause like Ari's DMT trip.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       I remember what the e three and you're just making waves of smell. You can't do that. You just can't not wear deodorant. I tried for a little while. It's weird. Isn't it interesting too that we've all just accepted that we have to put chemicals on certain parts of our body in order not to smell after you've been moving around for too long. It's weird man. Like have you ever shave your armpits once by mistake? Bad idea. I wonder how much of a effect it must have some effect on what your armpits smell like. How's too? Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:00:30       But you can't do it unless you're, unless you're a bodybuilder. Like there's things you could do. Like if my chest itches, I'll shave my chest and I'm, I'm embarrassed to say it but I'll do it. Especially if it gets itchy after a while. I don't fuck with my armpits bro. That's vain. Guys. Shaved their arms that don't have like something like carrot top or someone saying he shaves his arms. Yes. Does it cause he likes the hate the field. Well, carrot top used to be a super bodybuilder Jack Guy. I remember him. I think he said he'd just, he did at one time when he was a swimmer and he just liked to feelings. It's just like fuck, slippery, slippery through that pool slipping. Sliding. I oil up, oil up for I swim. So he's not buff anymore. He's back to normal. Well he's still buff. He's just not a giant bodybuilder guy. Creepy buff. He, I don't want to talk for him cause I don't know him but I know Dunkin did something with him a long time ago. They did a pilot for some sort of a reality show. That's right. Um, yeah, that's the carrot top. It is Jackie. Jackie just and that's like a normal karyotype. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       that's, I think it's more, he's like, now he's like more like looks fit. Okay. That Kathy Green. Yeah. But like back then he looked like super duper jacked. Like his shoulders were popping out unnaturally wide. Like it didn't even make sense. Like right there. Yeah, he went off the deep end. It looked like he had me mean. He's so big. Who knows what the fuck he was doing, what he was doing. A lot of shit that's shorter. It's not, look, it looks like an implants. Yeah. It could be, um, something called synthol that um, some bodybuilders, uh, engage in and what it does, they think it helps them balance out areas of their body that aren't big enough. And it's real weird cause there's a ton of videos of people taking, you know, the videos he's putting synthol in their muscles and dancing around. That's not that, that's just him looking buff.

Speaker 7:          02:02:33       That doesn't look anything nearly as bad. We're looking at a carrot top where he can see his dick route. It goes to the photo, goes all the way down as well. I call what I call it. So it's my name and Amy Cook always posting guys. Exactly what I, um, describe that look to people where a man has his underwear at the very base of his cock. That's your Dick Route. That's a beautiful term. Yeah. Thank you. I, by the way, I demand 100% credit for Dick rude tickers. I created it. So I was trying to figure out how to describe what was uncomfortable about those kinds of pictures. And it's like you're trying so hard and like that's Dick Route. That's Dick route all the way. Carrot top. Take any dignity Dick. It looks like case a thong on. It doesn't even look like it shouldn't be possible with the laws of gravity.

Speaker 7:          02:03:25       It looks like that things should fall down your ankles. Freckled boners she'd come rocketing at the screen like a three d shark in jaws three d three but he's, he's just jacked. I mean, he's just a guy who wants everybody suck his deck. Just like letting you know it's right there. Right there. That makes sense. But I mean, but he's just jack, that makes sense. But what does it make sense as the s the people would stick the oil in their arms and they would create like water balloons where their muscles should be and they would dance around and there's one video of a guy like throwing punches in the air with these water balloons for arms. It's so weird. It's just, it's so strange. Dick root. Remember that does a bunch of people that have those pictures. It was Dick route pictures. Didn't cook. Put like loves the Dick. Rick, he's a handsome fellow. I suppose she has a good works hard in the gym. I have to show the goods. Oh No, this guy, this guy, 100% is using that stuff for, he's got two equally sized tumors cause he think that looks good while he's probably mentally deficient and it's probably something wrong with them. Like

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       God now. Yeah. Now if he was like balancing on top of a skyscraper at the same time would be even worse. See the thing about this young man is, you know, it was probably something severely wrong with him, but what he is is an abuser look at him throwing punches. Like he's like some sort of a boxer character with this giant water balloon arms, but he's an abuser of something. How many people are, uh, a more reasonable user of it and use it. And that's what somebody thought that the carrot top stuff was, it's real common. Yeah. He's um, powerful arm wrestled guy has one arm. It's way more Jack. Yeah. That can't be good for you bro. That's real. Yup. Yup. He smashes people in arm wrestling. It's so crazy like, come on man. What is that? Don't do that dude. He's probably going to be hurting when he gets older.

Speaker 3:          02:05:31       We were at yesterday. Brian might know because he's likes this topic. Have you heard of the Korean Hawk guy that's supposedly dating Lindsay Lohan? Yeah. Right now all of a sudden it shows tmz. Jamie jumps in with relationship gossip. You son of a bitch. That's what you do every time. Well, they posted a photo last night, Jamie, and you know she's dealing with the irs, right

Speaker 1:          02:05:52       guys, super jacked. Holy Shit. Look at this dog. He's living with a werewolf that's like a monkey werewolf.

Speaker 3:          02:05:59       I tell you man, I love Korean. Uh, we had a family dinner for my girlfriend the other day and I come in and they're cupping or doing that thing where they, they like picture a little and then they put these glasses and they pretty much suck the bad blood out of you. So I walk in and there's just blood everywhere and towels and, and, and, and shit like that. What is it supposed to do? It's supposed to. We've talked about this before, right? It's supposed to some accelerate blood flow to the area, like polls, the tissue, the skin away from it and accelerates blood flow. Sometimes the blood comes out as gel, which is weird. It's supposed to, but there's what, I didn't know his lot it cause I posted a video of it while they were doing it. A lot of people are saying that cuppings bad for you. And then I did research. There is, if it goes bad, it goes bad. It leaves permanent damage if they, if they don't do it right. And really, yeah, if there's some photos that are pretty disturbing where like pretty much just holes in people's backs. Oh fuck yeah. But yet then the Olympians do it, you know, like people that people for the Olympics do it. So it's like, what's, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:07:02       well I don't know shit about medicine, but I would imagine, oh my God, what is that cup and gone back and he's man left with horrific holes in back after botched. Whoa. That's awful. That could be just somebody who did it completely wrong. Well. Well what what, what? What's that one? That far right where it looks like it horns lower. Right. Lower right the bottom. We'll keep going. Scroll down, scroll down. Scroll down. That one to the right in the middle with the orange and the blue, the right all the way to the right. Jamie, the other right edge of the screen. Go to the

Speaker 7:          02:07:36       edge of the screen. Dot Guy. Bam. Yeah, cause he's got horns. Oh this is a water buffalo horn to being used for it, but they're just using buffalo horn. Says Cups. Oh, what copping with buffalo horns. Look, Rogan does. So Yo Bro, I do that based on my balls, my nig route. What made sense to me is that you would kind of like create damage, which is while that blood exists and that maybe that it'd be like almost like a prp sort of a thing where all that extra blood that you've created from that area would go and help the blood flow to the part that's injured and they accelerate healing. He never know man, because it's, you can't say that people that are in the Olympics don't ever do anything stupid cause they definitely would do something stupid. Someone can talk to him in and doing a bunch of shit if he, if sometimes like the psychological edge and believing that there's something that's going to work really good, we'll be just enough to get a few people to do it. But this has been around for a while. This has been around long enough where people are going like, you know there's like really significant benefits things real. They really do it that way. Yeah. It's almost like traditional for I guess Korean culture because I mean they were just doing it like it was nothing. I had a family dinner. That's crazy. That's crazy. But maybe that works, you know? I mean the only way you find out of stuff like this works, which is like a really unconventional therapy is you've got to try it.

Speaker 7:          02:09:07       If all those super genius type guys that are training these Olympic athletes and getting them to peak performance and what could potentially be worth millions and millions of dollars in sponsorship money if they win the gold medal, if they're having these people get all cupped up is probably something to it kept up right in this day and age. I think it's like acupuncture. I feel like I don't know enough to know if that's accurate or not. It seems like it is. Some people believe in it a lot cause they pay a lot of money for it. Do it all the time. Yeah, for sure. Um, a lot of people do believe in acupuncture, but copping seems to me to be like more next level. It's like you're pulling the skin away from the area to the point where it bleeds and turns into the big ass bruise. They have this giant circle red spot where the increased blood flow hasn't been filtered out of the body.

Speaker 7:          02:09:51       Yeah. Like you got some weird shit happened there. That ain't normal thing. You got a big circle bruise on your back, right where you're hurt. Oh, I see what you're doing. You're making it all bleed in there so it flows everything out of there and heals it up quicker. It kind of makes sense to a dummy like me, like I don't know anything about how the actual body functions in terms of like how things heal and whether or not it would accelerate or not, but that Michael Phelps guys doing it. Yeah. When I asked him how has it feel afterwards, he says it took a refreshing, I feel way energetic now and relaxed. Well it's like people that wanted to deny the benefits of cryotherapy before like some papers came out. There's a lot of people poopooing and partly for good reason. It's cause a lot of the people that were running these cryotherapy sites got overzealous in their claims.

Speaker 7:          02:10:38       They got real overzealous in their claims of like how much weight you can lose, how much better you can look, all these different things that may or may not be true when it comes to throw cryotherapy, especially in the way they described it, but what can't be denied is the way it makes you feel. It makes you feel fucking amazing. You do three minutes. And while that was crappy prior therapy places you come out of there like, whoa, everybody I know that's tried has been like, whoa. Like I, I'll give a lot for that. Woo. Like that was good, but everybody's right to be suspicious because the part before the world was annoying. There was like a lot I like, you know, like in [inaudible] college in your skin and it's like a virtual face lift and like there's a lot of people are claiming some night, where's this? You gotta you gotta be able to prove that, but they can prove anti inflammatory markers in the blood. They can prove all these like, um, hormones and these, um, neurochemicals that your brain can, can make when you're a, you're in that tank when a cryotherapy chamber rather,

Speaker 1:          02:11:40       you done it yet. Now I want to do it today and now. Still be good to get you to do it today. Yeah, maybe I would ever see. I'll definitely do it. I just, today I don't, I don't feel great. Don't be a poser. May make you feel better. I hate it. Hate it. I had a milkshake last night and I have two minutes in there. Woke up at six in the morning. This is the whole podcast has been a ruse to get me to get you into the cryotherapy chamber. I don't want to do a couple of sesh youtube. This youtube, someone's going to burn. You'll touch the wall. Test the laws, but people do go in as couples, but you gotta be like right close to each other. Yeah. People like to endorse it together. Tom Air. Do you have a tank here now though?

Speaker 1:          02:12:25       Yes, we do. That's cool. Yes. We did a crash crash. Made it float lab. Shout out to the float lab. Float lab. Dennis Westwood. Yeah. Crashed. Put it in there. He's a wizard. He knows how to do it. It's all crazy. Filter ozone and UV light filters. One Micron field. He was explaining it all to me. It was like, it sounds good. It sounds like you did good shit. I'm too fucking dumb. Plus I can't pay attention to everything. That's a problem, man. That's how I feel when people keep bringing up bitcoin. I was like, let me know. Let me know when you get this sorted out. Because I watched a lot of, uh, a lot of things. I can't follow the bitcoin show. I can't, I just, I can't. So when we got those bitcoins, man, when I, when he gave us bitcoin's a long time ago, who gave us a bit of, uh, Andrea plus, right?

Speaker 1:          02:13:19       I've been trying to open up my wallet or find my password to that wallet. It's gone. Like, I, I'll never be able to get that bit coin he gave him, even though it was only at the University of it. Let it be a statistical anomaly. It's probably worth of dollars, billions, billions for now. It's like you get in and get out and people are accusing people of pump and dumps and there's subterfuge. Subterfuge is taken into consideration of some of the highs and the lows anyway, of course. Just like everything, right? Like big corporations taking over shit. It's like these, uh, these patterns are not normal. They're normal. You see them coming. If you're going to have something like Bitcoin, you're going to have people for sure. Not everyone's going to be, well, hey man, I'm a fucking thief. But now with Bitcoin, bitcoin would be super cool. No more deception. This is about the future. It's resolution, it's about resolution. This is about the children. Now anybody's a scam artist is going to be a scam artist and anything they can, whether it's a re a fake religion or fake dating site or fucking whatever, whatever they could do. Whatever they can get you with, they're going to get you with like, oh, this is what you guys do now. Okay, I'll pretend to be that operate in there. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:14:33       What do you think is the next big breakthrough that's going to change in terms of like how technology and people get along?

Speaker 4:          02:14:48       He's going to be a robot. Sex Doll. No, I think home home, uh, assistance, you know, like having a robot couldn't be your home base. Like computer. Uh, I dunno like these Alexis and I'll like apple's about to release Thurs and Google has released Thurs and

Speaker 1:          02:15:06       I seen the autonomous robots that monitor parking lots now. Yeah, I tweeted it I think yesterday, but definitely robots. We're going to give up our security and all our privacy at the same time.

Speaker 5:          02:15:22       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:15:23       We're going to be fine because the robot is going to be watching us. Keep an eye on me. Robot. This is going to be zero privacy, zero. It's real close. That's already there. But I mean real close to not just regular zero privacy, but like no one ever has a moment alone ever. It doesn't exist anymore. Like it will slowly erode. Then you'd go into the mountains in the put cell phone towers out there and then it's going to be it. Whatever the technology is, it's going to be, you're going to know where everyone is at any moment and we're going to really get to know each other. What do you got Jamie?

Speaker 4:          02:15:58       I was looking up for the thing I saw. I saw, and it wasn't on your twitter feed. I guess. I saw a video of like autonomous parking robots, building cars in and out of spots. I didn't put it on twitter. I thought it did

Speaker 1:          02:16:09       shit. Um, it was, uh, a comp. Appreciate. I retweeted it. You know what it does though. I think I retweeted somebody else saying, hey, this is happening or something like that. So it's probably not that clear. One of the more recent tweets tapping and Brian, they're going to be flying around us monitoring us. You saw that

Speaker 7:          02:16:30       one robot, I think it was in San Francisco. Beat up homeless people or something like that. Good move. Yeah. And stuff like that happens. There's going to be a big pull back. It's crazy. Robots. Fucking homes. We need robots picking on the downtrodden. That's good move. Let them know you post. These are on your way out. The robots are here. I mean that literally is like the first wave of immigrants from the silicone world. Robots at fuck with homeless people. The first, the first invaders tripping them and stuff. I robot. The thing about I robot as you'd watch it and it was, it was made just at the right time. It was made where you didn't think it's ever possible. It's made at a time. Well this is pretty cool. Like yeah man. The future. Yeah. I could see it being real. But you didn't think it was really possible and now you watch I robot and you go, oh, it's inevitable.

Speaker 7:          02:17:19       That's inevitable. That thing that does the robot thing w pretends to be a person and looks real freaky. That's easily doable. Or we set machinima. What's that one? That's it. Security robots are using two w uh, are being used to ward off San Francisco's homeless population. That's the drug. What's it called? Who makes that thing? Say they retired it. Oh, they did. There's a whole company that makes those things and has them like wandering around parking lots and I'm man, I hope I retweeted it. I tried to um, somebody sent it to me and I was like, okay, that's how it happens. They just have these things wandering around, recording everything. So everybody's responsible for any car accident. Anything that ever happens if it hears is someone's screaming rape. If it hears someone's screening police and immediately goes to the scene and films, there's no worries about its own mortality.

Speaker 7:          02:18:13       It's streaming in real time. It gets to record all altercations between people. Eventually hotels agree. As long as this is password secure and encrypted, they allowed to have the fire detector and the corner double as a video camera that records everything in the room at all times. What's going to happen. Yeah, I agree. Just got to get used to people watching your fuck and ready. I took the sticker off my webcam on my laptop a long time jet go joe. They can watch me all I want. I don't know why I'm more nervous about this in 2018 this is what silly. I mean it's become accelerated like I, I'm more nervous every year when it comes to technology because I'm not nervous in a, in a way that I think it's totally 100% negative but nervous in the way. Like it just seems to me that we might be in the middle of something and not be paying attention like it, that it's happening so fucking fast that we're caught up in it and it's just wild wave of change and I'm just trying to make sense of it while it's happening. But then there's something about like numbers, like I used to think that saying like the year 2017 2000 it's a stupid, who cares what year it is? It's all just now. But no, there's like a way we feel about it differently.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       Like you, oh, it's a fucking 2018 dude, dude. It's like you have a feeling about you now. It's like we're, we're very, very far ahead in this game. This is, this is the future. 2018 that's a crazy number. Hey Man, it's 1979 nope, it's 2018 whoa. So weird. And when does this thing, like, if you had to guess, how much longer does the human race have? Six months. It seems like if you really had to guess, we're not going to be here forever. Right? So we're not going to be here a hundred thousand years from now or 200,000 years from now. We're just not,

Speaker 4:          02:20:12       I started listening to the audio book of Sapiens. Yeah. And that's, I feel like that's what it's getting to. That question you're asking is the first couple chapters are leading up to like he says it over and over again like thousands of years from now, maybe 2000 is what it's saying that the human race won't be or human beings won't be what we are today. We'll be another evolution of whatever that is. Because off of Australia Pickett.

Speaker 2:          02:20:35       Yeah. I was trying to pick the guests Australia pithiness see if you find any good pictures of that thing. I mean this is what they think. They think that that that's what started it. That was when it was like fairly distinctly human. It's gonna. It's gonna keep going. It's going to go to some new thing. There it is. Look at that thing. I mean that's so close. It's what like a walking upright chimpanzee and then that got smarter and that got smarter and things kept going. But the thing that really fucks you up is, it's not that long ago. I think Australia Pythius was less than 2 million years. Right? It sounds right. And then there's a modern homo sapiens, which I think they think are somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 500,000 years old. They keep moving it around a little bit. When they find some new dead guy, they find some new bones and they're like, oh, this one's older.

Speaker 2:          02:21:28       They got to the iconic guessing. I want to say they're in the neighborhood of 300,000 that ain't shit, dude. That ain't shit. That just happened. If that's when they really started. That just happened. So you're talking about 300,000 years from now. Uber. It's crazy. We're going to be made out of gas. We're going to be like those fires that aren't petroleum. You won't be able to see us are intelligent to be all pervasive. We'll, we'll have a one operating system that we share with mother earth. They'll plug it into, our brains will plug into the ground and we'll, we'll become divine. How about that? No, I don't know. No one's here. That's how I am. Like let him go. Just go to him. He'll come back. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:22:11       I always wonder what they thought about this 200 years ago. 150 years ago, what they thought are we, I feel like they thought that the world is going to end too back then. Yeah, but he's always daughters away from an ending.

Speaker 2:          02:22:22       Sure. I mean anytime, anything, especially back when there was media, anytime

Speaker 7:          02:22:26       anything catastrophic happened in your area, you thought that was going to be the end.

Speaker 5:          02:22:31       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:22:32       And the moon was made as cheese. It's, it's really weird how recent that was. That's what's weird. When you just think about hundreds of thousands of years, it seems like a long ass time, but it's not. When you talk, talk about the shape of human beings and what what's happened in that amount of time, especially in the last few hundred or few thousand years, just all you need is sick. If you want to like really impress the shit out of people, give me 10,000 years, 10,000 years ago, 10,000 years now you're like, wow, you'd freak out. There's no other time in history. That would be the case. Like every other time in history, 10,000 years would be like, whoa. They figured out how to make cooler houses. Like, Whoa, he's riding an elephant. How do you figure that out? Like, Whoa, all that bone is way better than my bow and Arrow every 10,000 years, no big deal. And then all of a sudden, one 10,000 year period and you have everything, you got the pyramids, you got space travel, you've got the internet, you've got video photography, three d printers.

Speaker 4:          02:23:36       Every time you say something like this, this, uh, pops in my head, the end of gangs in New York, which shows that montage of the hundred years or so of New York changing. Nice. Thinking about how that's only a hundred years in New York changed from this crazy nothingness even though it's really big then to like tons of skyscrapers and bridges and all of what it is today. And it wasn't any, anything close to that back then. And that's like what a hundred years? And you're talking about 10,000 but that's so much more time compared to a hundred.

Speaker 7:          02:24:05       Yeah. That's an amazing montage. Timelapse, what would you call that? That's time lapse. Look at that. That's incredible.

Speaker 5:          02:24:13       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:24:14       New York City's a freak out man and even more crazy look at that keeps going and that's even bigger now. Oh my God. And towers aren't there. Yeah. In New York City is a genuine freak out. Unless you've been, you should go.

Speaker 7:          02:24:28       If you've been in, you get it. You're like, yeah, it's not so love gone, but if you haven't been, it's a paradigm shifter because you realize that it's possible. It's such a big city. I've been a lot of big cities, but New York City is so crazy and it's the way it's constructed that you go there, you have like a different feel about you. You're like, Whoa, okay. We're in New York City. This is, this is different. It is different. These buildings are fucking giant. These people are everywhere. This is crazy. This is, this is a different, completely different feeling

Speaker 7:          02:24:57       and different people. Yeah. Unfortunately, the people are straddled down by the echoes of the emigrants that were their great grandparents and their grandparents and their struggle that they had to get from Europe over to America. This is my thought because this is my own family. I'm talking about. I feel like, uh, a lot of the Italian immigrants with my grandfather, he came over when was boy and his family and a on both my mom's and my dad's side. They all came over from Europe, from either from Ireland or from Italy. And they were all like really aggressive risk taking people, you know? And those are the people that built that whole area, which is just all you think about like what a crazy accomplishment it is to build this gigantic city from all these immigrants that came over from Europe, you know, from 1700 whatever it is on just construct and all these incredible buildings. So very, very bizarre accomplishment. But that same kind of energy, you know, that brought those people over there in the first place would create like a lot of interpersonal conflict and a lot of aggression. I don't know if New York's totally gotten past that. I think they have more now than ever before. Like they, I was reading something about the crime rate that New York's crime rate is lowest. It's been in a long ass time.

Speaker 3:          02:26:17       I think we're at the highest right now. Right? La Is he making this sub? I feel like I just saw something the other day where if I had more homicides this year, then recent, you fall asleep. It seems like it. I'm not trying to remember. I think I saw something that was close to that, but I thought the murder rate was down, but violent crime was up here. Let me just, we have a police chase. More pimps lapse in ever three police chases is a day on the TV. It's like ridiculous. How

Speaker 7:          02:26:43       that's awesome. Yeah. A police chase their fucking terrifying cause you don't want the cops just let someone run away or you don't want the cops to slam into you or they're chasing some guy, you know close. Yeah. Crime rates in New York City reached record lows as a article about it. The blasio. That's the guy, right. It's just if you don't know that that's possible. Going there and seeing that it's possible and then realize that its home within a hundred years, that's where it's mind boggling or 200 years or whatever in New York Syndrome has been around for in totality.

Speaker 5:          02:27:17       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:27:17       What is the world we're experiencing right now going to be like in a hundred years? I mean are

Speaker 5:          02:27:24       okay.

Speaker 7:          02:27:24       It's, it almost seems to me like there's no way we're going to be able to guess. If you look at how quick that accelerated and use that as a pattern. Like that kind of happened all across the country. We Chicago, La, San Francisco, they all were nothing and then everything, you know

Speaker 3:          02:27:39       say New York won't be here in a hundred years because of the water rising up. Right. That would be crazy. Fuck fuck.

Speaker 7:          02:27:46       Well we have a water crisis and a lot of parts of the country just got to suck the water out of the ocean and use it to spray all these dry ass bushes. So we stop the fires. Yo mother thinking I'm always thinking suck the water out of the ocean. Stop. Look, stop making new houses for a while and start concentrating on sucking the water out of the ocean to put out the fire. Just water. All those trees.

Speaker 3:          02:28:08       Dick, suck out the water out of the air. Like he could just get a bunch of humidifiers and then spray the water. That's not good because then people would dry out and then the botox goes up. This is what I think.

Speaker 7:          02:28:20       They got to figure out how to the salt out of the water. Right? They know how to do it, but you can't just take ocean water and [inaudible] like spray it on your lawn. Right. Kill Your fucking lawn. Well on it. I don't know about that. It's fake lawn. I don't know. Then nobody, I mean if if you have crops in your backyard, say say if you're growing tomatoes and you decide to water it with ocean water, would that be a bad idea? Yes,

Speaker 3:          02:28:44       it would. Assault would be terrible for it, right? What is that? It would just assault would stay, would kill anything else or just see red. It's like, I don't think that's exactly what rest is, but it turn into some sort of fucked up chemical compound that isn't grass well hard water.

Speaker 7:          02:28:58       It kind of poison it. It'd be a higher salt content than the uh, the plant wants to exist on. And I think that would be the case with a lot of stuff that doesn't live in the ocean. Right. So you'd have to figure out a way to get that salt out. But once you did that water be super valuable. Like we're always low on water just, and we have too much of it now. It starts sucking out of the ocean. Just use our own need to like we have a, a crazy need to use stuff, you know, a constant need. We have a constant need for consumption. So let's consume the water in the ocean, suck it out.

Speaker 3:          02:29:33       They, they, they do it. It's just very expensive and it's like they do it in San Diego. I think there's a salt water plant or something. But yeah, we just got to get better at that.

Speaker 7:          02:29:41       Better process for it. Yeah. See everybody is concentrating. All the money is in robot fuck doll. So not spending any time working on this water

Speaker 3:          02:29:48       problem must get on top of that,

Speaker 7:          02:29:52       bro. You got to figure this out, Ilan. It can be done and cancer to cancer first. I think cancer can be severely medicated in some circumstances by diet. And I think that's the thing to concentrate on first before a pill. Brian, that's probably crispr. Crispr. Imagine if there was a way you could just eat shit all day and be jacked. They Jeremiah Walking boot, no, port Jeremiah. Don't even say that. 30 pounds. Well, let's explain to everybody what you're talking about,

Speaker 3:          02:30:24       John. So we do that kill Tony Show and Jeremiah Watkins and Tony Hinchcliffe kind of copied like, you know, I like the Toms digger formula, but backwards to see how much weight they can gain in a month. Tony did the like working out and trying to gain muscle weight, uh, where Jeremiah just ate like shit for 30 days and gain 30 pounds in 30 days where Tony only gained 2.5 pounds, I think it was.

Speaker 7:          02:30:51       Yeah. It was just over three pounds. Yeah. Yeah. 30 pounds to Tony Hinchcliffe who gained just over three pounds. Jeremiah one nugget. The hose killed Tony Show and keep his hair.

Speaker 3:          02:31:02       Yeah, the bullshit was in the bed though. And one of the most funniest nights I've had in a long time was you calling out Tony about how it's not fair if Jeremiah loss, he had to shave his head. Well, this is what I said. I said,

Speaker 7:          02:31:14       why this is not an even bet. Like you guys should both be betting the same thing. Like if Jeremiah wins, all he does is get to sit down in a seat for like a day. He gets a hosted, an episode of the podcast, he gets to sit in a seat. So everybody knows it's funny, but if he won or if you want, he has to shave his fucking head. Like that's crazy. And Jeremiah has nice long hair where Tony has really short hair would have grown back in like a day. Jeremiah, his hair seems like kind of a part of who he is. Like just get silly hair. It's just big silly fella. And, uh, he likes his haircut. It just, but he was willing to do it and I told Tony, I was like, fuck that. I go, look dude, you got to, you guys have to have the same bet.

Speaker 7:          02:31:58       I go, why are you scared to shave your head? It'd be amazing. I go, how about this? How about even better? You don't have to shave your head. You have to wear lipstick on stage for a year. Tony said that. What did it Tony Bring it up. You're like, hey joe. Joe was my joke. You don't remember what I did. I said it. And then after I was trying to force him into doing, cause he didn't want to do it. I go, you know what's fucked up? It was Tony's idea and I just threw him under the bridge. I was like, I don't know why you want to wear lipstick, man. This is weird. Oh my God. That he really did. No, no, no, no. Do you remember I was saying that everybody was dying laughing. The reason why everybody was dying laughing because they knew I was just fucking with them.

Speaker 7:          02:32:33       I was like, it was his idea, which was so weird. No, but the idea was you would have to go on stage and then once you're on stage you have to put lipstick on or we would decide that you, uh, had to have it on when you walked out to the crowd either or. We didn't decide. And then you could take it off after 15 minutes. So if you were doing like a headline of set somewhere and he'd do an an hour for the first 15 minutes, you're wearing makeup. So I said, but here, the thing about that, the thing about that beautiful red lipstick is that it would make you concentrate on a joke about why the fuck you were willing to make a bat. How you lost the bat, what you know, and then rationalize, rationalize away about nothing wrong. How come? Chapsticks okay, but lipstick gain, you know, how come girls get the word lipstick, Bro?

Speaker 7:          02:33:19       What the fuck are we doing man? Like what is this? Dad had been so funny. If he had to wear lipstick for a year, it would have been hilarious. He wouldn't, it wasn't. I told them I would do it too. Yeah. You got home? Yeah. I said I'd do it. Oh, so I'll do it too. Come on. We'll all do it together. Don't be scared. Take it back. It's not a hard bed. It's funny. You'd have to, you'd have to like have the lipstick years photos where every time we were on stage and just what you have, you have like a, like a package of wet wipes with you bring on stage and a dry white towel and everybody knows you got 15 minutes, lipstick time. You might grow to like it, you know, he might start getting her nails did and everything. You definitely could come up with bits from it.

Speaker 7:          02:34:02       It could be possible and it would be fun for people to, to like go along with Tony. Can't handle that. Johnny scared. I feel like he's scared. Right. I think it should at least shave his head. He should've shaved his head. He should've had a deal. Obviously he has way more beautiful hair than I do. And, um, but I feel like if I had good hair and shave it off cause I knew it would come back. It's super shit. Tony has super shirts. Tony Hinchcliffe man, that's Eddie Izzard, Eddie Izzard and lipstick on is Eddie Izzard. Um, living as a woman now somebody told me that I really, yeah. Yep. Mom, not necessarily living as a woman. It's still looks like as Eddie has her dress with lipstick and a dress. I Dunno. Um, Eddie Izzard we'll have my respect for, for all his days because Eddie Izzard, uh, ran a marathon a day with no training all around Ireland.

Speaker 7:          02:35:04       Do you know about that thing? Dude? He didn't even prepare for it. Wow. He didn't even prepare for it. He just finished him. Yes, he did it all. Wow. He wrote up marathon a day for like four weeks or something crazy. Right. Wasn't it dude, his feet were literally falling apart. Like they would show them cleaning up his feet and taking care of his skin. It was just torn to pieces, mad. It was just straight, raw mental toughness and a resolve that, I mean, you think about him, you think about him as a comedian, a funny guy, a thoughtful guy, and he had that odd thing that he was doing where he was wearing women's clothes and all that stuff. 27 marathons in 27 days. Yeah, you don't, you don't really know what that guy's about until you watch this documentary that you could watch online.

Speaker 7:          02:35:54       Um, what does it, is there a name for it where people can search it? It's amazing, man. You'll find it. So, um, what he did was, I don't, I don't even remember what the charity was. Do you remember what the charity was? Was some sort of a charity? If he did the 27 marathons, I think he only took a couple of days off, like they're here and there. There were days where he literally couldn't, couldn't walk. He like, he had to, I feel like he did this twice to Jesus Christ. This says he did 43 marathons in 51 days. Oh my God. Oh my. That might be the new thing. He did it again. I bet it was a marathon. Man Doesn't show 43 marathons in 51 days. Oh my God. So he did it before. He did less and then he came back and did it again. Wow.

Speaker 7:          02:36:42       Somebody told me about it a few years ago, but it was after the fact. I didn't know he's done it twice kinds of fucking animal. It's crazy. He's an animal. I mean, that's just crazy. But then I read something, um, unrelated. I read something that he, uh, was living as a woman, but that might not be real. Hmm. He might just feel like we're in a dress that day. He said he answered, you run 53 marathons, whatever the fuck he did. You can do whatever you want. Dude. Maybe his dick fell off this in 2016 and then the first one was in 2009. Ah, okay. That makes sense. Because the 2009 one I think I found out about

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       around 2012 or something like that, I remember watching it, thinking that's, that's a kind of mental toughness that very few people have. I don't think I have it to run that many marathons. And how many days you might have to force yourself into that too. In the last day, Jesus Christ, what? He ran a double marathon on the last day. So that was the toughest day of my life. Holy Shit, dude. If I've had to take off to go to the hospital, so we had to make up one. Oh my God. He had to go to the hospital to get his kidneys checked out. So on day 27 I ran my 26 and my 27th marathon double marathon on the last day. So that was the toughest day of my life. I'm telling you, man, that is not a regular person. A guy who is not like a Cam Haynes type guy who's in shape, who could just do like campaigns can run a marathon a day and it's not hard.

Speaker 2:          02:38:10       Like if he no bullshit. If he wanted to go and do 27 marathons in 27 days, he'd be like, yeah, I've done that already. He could just do it. He can go do that. But, but Eddie Izzard was not, he wasn't planning for that. He liked, he didn't get in shape before he did it. Unless he did the second time, I might be wrong about the second time. The first time he did it, he didn't get in shape for it. And to see him run in those 27 marathons, it's just like, it's all just mental toughness. He just forced his body to keep moving. What does it say here? He's going into politics and 20, 20. Oh Shit. King of the world. Eddie Izzard, he maybe he's the first print transgender president if he decided to go for it to be born here and we fix that well, president of where they live. I also did all these marathons in South Africa where the weather was a bit hotter than it wouldn't be. And listen to Dan were music duck and crocodiles.

Speaker 5:          02:39:09       Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:39:11       So he's going to go into a um, yeah. He, his reasoning here, he says, that's why I pulled that up. Wow. So he's doing these races just to get people to pay attention to the messages behind. He's not really into racing. That's interesting.

Speaker 5:          02:39:25       Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:39:29       Interesting. He's a very thoughtful guy and, but what impressed me the most is not just like the words that he strings together and how he says things, which is always impressive, but someone who can do that, like that is not normal. That's extraordinary because he's, he's, it would be extraordinary for someone who's in great shape, like a person who is like a um, you know, world class like that Courtney Dole, Walter Lady, if she ran 27 marathons in 27 days, it would still be remarkably impressive. It is just the amount of time that you have to spend running every day for 27 days. That shit is impressive. That's just impressive.

Speaker 5:          02:40:13       But

Speaker 7:          02:40:14       to do it when you're just a guy who's a comic and did not even in shape, he wasn't even, he wasn't even thin. You have like, like a bit of a belly,

Speaker 7:          02:40:24       but he wasn't lean by any stretch of the imagination. It didn't look like a runner. Does he still do comedy? I don't know man. I feel like I haven't seen or heard about him in a long time. I think we'll, we're guilty over here of not paying attention to what happens in comedy anywhere else in the world. You know, I, I had somebody has to like beat me over the head with somebody that's really funny from somewhere else for me to pay attention. I just saw that they have roast battle now and in UK. Here he goes, Eddie izzard believe me tour. Not that it matters, but find out if he's a woman. She in French. Whoa. Of course he's a genius. Fuck guys doing shows in French. The show was in French. Just shows in French. It's sows. Fuck man. I'm gonna go there with those Google Pixel headsets.

Speaker 7:          02:41:06       It's all he stuff. Yeah, man. That's, that's where, uh, originally I got the idea of us being able to communicate with plants. I figured this is step one. Step one is the Google Pixel earbuds. It let you listen to someone speak Spanish and real time translate it to English. Step two is they figure out some sort of a universal code that the plant world is willing to accept and we start communicating back and forth to the plant world. Step three, they develop a headset, some sort of a neural interface with a human being. When they put this thing on and you go out into the forest and you communicate with the trees, that's frequency. I say that hundred percent. Why Not Joe? I have to do is get them to obviously communicating with themselves. There's some form of communication between plants. This has been proven cause a bunch of weird shit they do.

Speaker 7:          02:41:50       Like they changed the way they taste based on whether or not they hear things going on in the distance that he or someone eating them in the distance and they'll change the way they taste. They catch things down wind like the smell of them getting consumed by another animal will change the way they test. Like that was the case. What the, uh, Keisha Bush and giraffes, they found that giraffes that we're eating these Acacia Bushes, uh, upwind. Upwind when it's downwind, yeah, down upwind. When they would eat them, the smell of them consuming them would come down when and it would change the flavor profile of all these other trees. They would turn nasty tasting to avoid the giraffes from eating them. Hmm. That's crazy dude. So then, then they figured out that they could play the sound of caterpillars munching leaves right next to the tree and it would have the same effect. Wow. Yeah. So

Speaker 7:          02:42:44       somehow or another, they know what it sounds like when they're eating. I don't know if they try everything like we're going to have sex with this tree and just see what happens or vertical. The tree vegans are super not happy about plants being alive and thinking you bring it up, they get so triggered. It is one of the most triggering things. His plant intelligence research they cause they want to claim moral superiority. They want to claim that, you know La, la, la, I can't hear the plant. There's that cabbage is screaming when you pull it out of the ground, you fuck screaming for its family. The interconnectedness with the mycelium and the soil just beautiful. Yeah, that, but I think what's going to fix veganism honestly is that a robot meet that that artificial lab created meat. I was going to fix it. People are gonna realize like, Yo all just healthier this way he body has more vitality. It's going to be extinct, veganism is going to be extinct in the future. As soon as they come up with super ethical meat, there's going to be no reason for it. Everybody's going to go watch too. And I feel so much better when I eat steak.

Speaker 7:          02:43:47       It's just fuck like it's, it's, there's obviously a reason why we're having all this debate. It's not like it's crystal clear one way or another. It's like it's not good that an animal die so that you'll live. That's not good. That doesn't feel good, but it's not good if they get over populated either. Again, that's not good either. You know, it was what I was reading this thing about, um, there's an animal called an hour dad. It's like a sheep. And um, they, uh, imported them to Texas a long time ago and they don't taste good to eat apparently. Or maybe a lot of people were eating in the wrong way. So because of that, they don't hunt them a lot. Or if they do hunt them, it's not like the same way they hunt whitetail deer or something like that. And they live in these like difficult to get to remote parts of like West Texas and shit. And so then some of them, the ranchers have taken to like firing guns out of helicopters to get rid of him. Like this is crazy. Like you have animals that you're, you're hunting with helicopters that you brought over here from another place, but they look like, just like they're cool looking man. They look like some sort of a star wars type

Speaker 7:          02:44:58       goat creature, sheep creature. They have the amazing horns. There was enormous horns, but apparently they just can't figure out a way to make them taste good. This is from everybody that I know that's tried to eat them, give it to an Asian now, figure it out. It's probably a good call. I wonder if there must be somebody that thinks they taste good and knows the dude, but pull up a picture of an hour. Dad, sheep. It's like, will you look for, I haven't. I'll Wafi sheep. No, no. It's like, it's called Aoudad. They're like one of the few animals that are like universally thought to tastes like shit. Wow. From people that hunt them, but they're here and they have to control their population. So what do you do about them? What do you do about wild pigs? We did do about animals to get to the, unless you want to let predators loose. That's it right there. That picture. Oh, that's a stone sheep. No, I'm, it's our dad. It's like, how'd you spell it out of you a dad? I only have a picture of those fuckers. Um, Aoudad Hunt Texas, but type in that because they're very popular to hunting in Texas, but I don't think a lot of people will. Our debt hunt Texas. Yeah, those are um, dear. That's not the same thing about

Speaker 1:          02:46:09       that. How do you spell that? Our Dad word out. None of these things are the Aoudad. How would that is like big, thick, um, horns say it to Siri and see what she comes up with? Well, either way I'll find it. Um, what, what would you do with all the, if we did figure out a way to never have an animal suffer again, but we could all eat meat, what would you do with all the animals that existed? That would be a giant dilemma. Like how many people would say, yeah, you know what, that's all well and good, but I want a cow that just got killed. I want a real cow. It's really alive. It makes me think and feel better. Would have to add. Is that it? No, that was the closest. Some else [inaudible] that's some sort of feral sheep all Parra that's weird that they don't have Alad Dad.

Speaker 1:          02:46:57       Maybe try a different spelling. Aoudad sheep hunt Texas. Anyway. Um, the delicate balance of like prey and Predator. Like how do you manage that if you have certain populations of these animals just running loose? Somebody sent me a video. That's it. I just took the word off. It just that she texted. Go back to that last one you had. That's exactly what it looks like. Hmm. Look at that thing. It looks like the devil. Right? Those horns. That's like some sate and shit from Damien. It's weird that meat is not just meet that. Like he can't just like take that leg off and eat it. Nope. It's definitely different. Some people say a goat is delicious, but I think it really depends upon the diet of the goat. And some goats, they eat weird shit and they taste terrible and some, some goats they eat, you know, mmm delicious plants and you eat them.

Speaker 1:          02:47:48       And I bet it tastes as good as anything you're ever going to eat. It really did. It varies so much between the people that say it tastes amazing versus the people that say it tastes terrible. That's a perfect example of one. I mean that looks like something from Star Wars. Well, you could say that it's crazy looking, but what would you do? So if we did figure out a way to have all of our meat come out of a laboratory, so nothing has to die. What do we do about all the animals? Zoo Zoo. That's not right. That's even crazier. Like did not have a ranch instead of a zoo animal island do. That's it. That's the island we were talking about. We ship all the animals to like some giant like New Zealand and make a deal with New Zealand. We're going to bring home with lions, Bro, but with no predators to net deck drastic park basically.

Speaker 1:          02:48:35       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You'd have to bring over predators to, you'd have to create a wild ecosystem. Just a fully wild ecosystem and just everybody else. There's so many people by the year 2099 that we have occupied every single stretch of the world and everything looks like New York City except one continent, which is like central park for the world. So the world is now one enormous city, but we've maintained like the Amazon, the Amazon rain forest is what we cherish. That's our last connection to mother earth. Before we slip in to some symbiotic relationship with computers, Don, Don, Don, we're allowed to visit this island in little hamster ball. So yeah, dude, just like Jurassic Park, this could be real. It could be real. I mean this literally, it sounds crazy, but if you're talking about 500 years from now, we literally could have occupied every single part of the earth except for one place.

Speaker 1:          02:49:29       We literally could make some sort of a deal. They'll like when nobody goes to the Amazon, thinks you'd be a great science fiction movie. Feel free to steal it, steal it, dark mirror. I think we need to start building underwater, underwater cities that she imagined. You're underwater. We'll see a little crack in the wall and you're coming home and you're on edibles and you're so tired, but you have to be at work at three hours and you look and you see a little, just a small crack in the world and you go, do I talk about this crack I taught? Maybe it's just a flaw in the glass. It just looks like a crack and then as you're, as you're going back home at the end of your shift, it looks just a little bigger. She, I'd rather did this and the Mars, I trust underwater cracks.

Speaker 1:          02:50:08       Marlon going in a tesla, the Mars, just the feeling of all the walls exploding instantaneously and billions of gallons of ocean water crushing your very existence instantaneously. Sober, chill, boom. Just a smash of the ocean, hundred feet deep around you crushing everything. As soon as that crack gets big enough, I'm freaking me out. So you would do Mars? No, I want and I'm not doing anyone any of that. Fuck themselves. I even getting submarine. Nope, no desire. I want to see Nimo at Walt Disney though. It was a fun rog. Great for Little Kids Finding Nemo. You go out in the little submarine and they have a little show they do for you. It's wonderful. That's about as good as it gets. How about that one lady who was a reporter who went in the guy submarine and he killed her and chopped her up to capitate at her like, what the fuck he imagine if you're a lady and you go out there and you're looking to do a story about a guy who made his own submarine and then somewhere along the line he kills you and chops you up and throws in the ocean.

Speaker 1:          02:51:18       You got to think like when you're going to visit interview a guy who made a submarine, there's no way this guy's gonna chop me up. That's not going to happen. He knows that everybody knows I'm going to visit him. I kinda believe his excuse a little, but then I, you know that where the hatch just closed on her head. Yeah, but you're supposed to tell people that, you know, it's supposed to chop her up and throw in the ocean and pretend nothing happened to them. Did you just tell everybody who's a horrific accident and you feel terrible and you get punished and fuck man, poor lady. 11 days to think about it though. He had 11 days sort of reading it right now as you guys were saying it, uh, her for her torso is found 11 days later. Well first he said she died of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Speaker 1:          02:52:03       It previously had said the thing hit her, hit her head. It was 150 pound hatch door. Oh, Jesus Christ. Did you imagine that? Oh my God, that makes sense. Hatch door hitting your head makes sense. But either way, fuck submarines. Do Fuck submarines. Right? Do you have any desire to go bungee jumping? Nope. Good for you. So I'm scared of heights. I don't want any of that. Fuck all that right. The squirrel suit doesn't sound terribly. What? It sounds kind of fun. You did the squirrel so I wouldn't do it. It sounds fun. Flashy. You. Um, let me know when you can do that so I can prepare for your absence forever. Going to be anytime soon. Life insurance policy on the stump. Fucking call you to clock in the morning. I'll lit up, try to get you to jump off the Alps. But if he ever gets a suit with some jets on it, I might be.

Speaker 1:          02:52:51       What if that goes wrong? What if that's like the tesla door handles it one open up. So come on man, don't do it man. You want to parasail anymore? Yeah, but hang gliding is, I've heard of people like getting shot up in a hang glider 300 feet and just a little like spout of air that they can't control and you're fucked on that phone call that we're crazy. Yeah. This is all that for thrills, for wild thrills and God dammit we're going to have flying cars though. That's no the thing they're looking into, there's a lot of people that are seriously considering flying cars right now. I think it's a matter of time before they locked that down. I think it's going to be automated pilots or mean driverless cars first in that technology. Then flying, I think you're totally right and I think they're going to have the same sort of like lane departure warnings and all the stuff that like keeps cars from crashing into each other, the correct and that people are just going to say, well, as long as they're autonomous, it actually makes it more efficient to use the entire three d space and not have the, the landscape marred with all these hard roads.

Speaker 1:          02:53:54       I haven't been a bummer today have, I feel like I'm freaking out. I'm freaking me out. I don't know why I'm more serious about this shit heading into 2018 but it just seems ominous. Dom, dom, dom. All right. I gotta pee so bad. We have to wrap this up. I've been holding it in. Yeah. I drank too much coffee before this one. It's almost three hours. Yeah, almost three hours. All right. Brian Redman, tell everybody where you are and how can everybody mock Tony Hinchcliffe they can contact him at Tony Hinchcliffe on twitter. Yeah, that's right. Give Jeremiah Watkins some love and we'll be doing his stand up on the spot show, uh, next Tuesday in the belly room. It's fun. Show people make shit up. Jeremiah is an awesome person and your show with him is a on every Monday money, Jeremiah is going to host the next one and we're bringing killed Tony to Houston, February 1st and Dallas the second Funsho go out there and support much respect, much love a red band on twitter and instagram and all that good stuff. And uh, we'll be back really soon, like in a few minutes with a Jimmy Smith formerly of Beltour. He's here now. Oh Bye. [inaudible].
