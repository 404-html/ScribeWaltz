Speaker 1:          00:00:00       We're live. All Right Jeff, thank you very much man. Appreciate you coming on here. It was very cool talking to you in Brazil and even though it was a very short conversation, I learned a lot and I got very fired up about this podcast. Awesome, man. Great to be here. Thanks for having me. Well, thank you. And thank you for all the stuff you've done it for folks who don't know, you're the guy who essentially took down Lance Armstrong or at least made the case or solidify. I mean, how would you describe it? Yeah, I mean I was involved in the investigation. Um, you know, it was a case run by the Department of Justice out of Los Angeles. I was one of the case agents on it, so I was associated with it. That's one of the things that's creepy about it is that the government was going after bike riders.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       It's like, wouldn't you think that they've got some really important shit to do? Like I think that bothered a lot of people about the baseball thing with barry bonds and with mark mcgwire and all that Sammy Sosa stuff. It's like, why is that the fucking congress involved? And it seems. Yeah. You know, uh, you know, on one hand these were laws that, you know, the agencies I was with was, we're tasked to investigate, uh, on the other hand in terms of importance, um, you know, I was on a personal level. I looked at the message that was being sent to youth not only this country but of the world and that it, it became a fact that in the mid to late nineties, steroid use was so pervasive in sports that kids are smart these days. You on the Internet, they know what's going on, that it really did see it trickling down to kids, you know, in high school.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       And at some point if you wanted to take that sport far enough, you ultimately had to make that decision, hey, do I want to keep going? And if I do, I'm gonna have to make a decision whether or not, you know, I'm going to use these things. So, um, I think, you know, the, I think about the number of conversations that probably happened around dinner table between parents and kids because of these cases, got to be in the hundreds of thousands if not millions. And that alone right there, you know, I think would justify the resources that were spent defendants in those cases always. I was always overblown in terms of the research, the resources that the government did spend doing it, you know, you heard often the barry bonds case was 50 slash $55,000,000 case. It really wasn't, um, you know, in that case involved not steroid use but lying in front of a grand jury.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       So it transcended spare steroid use. It was about lying and telling the truth and misusing the justice system. I've had agents all across the country on non-steroid related cases come up to me and say, hey, thanks, thanks for that case, because we can use as a, as an example when we go out and interview witnesses or witnesses come before a grand jury that, look, you need to tell the truth and if you don't look what can happen. You know, the government went after barry bonds or shouldn't, they will go after you and when that truth starts being told like that, the are legal justice system starts working. When it doesn't, it breaks down.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       So it wasn't $55,000,000. How much was actually spent around, you know, it's funny. A 49, 40 9:50, no, not even close. Some media outlet, uh, did a freedom of information request with the US Attorney's office in San Francisco who prosecuted the case. So this was after the case was done. So they put the dollar figures together with the trial costs and not, not, not necessarily, you know, the entire investigation. But the trial itself, I think it was less than $100,000. And the comment was, Jesus is the most cost efficient high profile trial that's probably ever happened. Um, but that's not a full account of all the money that was spent trying to bring them down. It's not that. And again, this wasn't trying to bring anybody down. This was a situation where he went before grand jury, uh, didn't tell the truth. Uh, his grand jury transcript, ironically enough, was leaked by the BALCO BALCO attorneys, defense attorneys, and so the public all of a sudden got to read exactly what he said in there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       Um, it was obvious that he at least was obstructing, if not outright, not telling the truth. Um, and so I think the Justice Department was faced with, what do we do now, what kind of message are we sending if we don't prosecute this guy, it sends a message that, you know, far transcends steroid use in sports. There's thousands of witnesses every day that appeared before grand juries. So it was almost a necessity to have to do it. It wasn't about steroids, but it was about steroids because the only reason why he was there was questioning him about steroids. So it essentially was, and it's not a lot of people feel like when it comes to like organized crime, like didn't they bust Al Capone on tax evasion? Like that's how a lot of people get caught. They get caught lying while they're in the middle of committing a crime.

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       But it's really about the original crime, wasn't it? Well, they did. I mean, that's why he was brought in there, but you know, when he was brought in, it was made very clear that, look, you got to tell us, accusing you for using steroids. He was given immunity, actually show them that long as you tell the truth, you're not targeting this thing, you're just a witness. So tell the truth. But he was never convicted for using steroids and wasn't he off the hook even as far as the investigation goes, like he never did any time and it was even penalized. Like how was he penalize other than having to go through trials and spend a lot of money? Yeah. I mean ultimately, you know, after he was convicted in the jury trial, the judge sentenced under house arrest. Um, but I tell you that he's got a sweet house.

Speaker 2:          00:05:28       It's not really that bad. Can you can watch TV when you're in the house arrest? I think you can, you know, it seems a little ridiculous. I like being at home, but I'll tell you, even in a situation like that, I tell people all the time and being under investigation to begin with going through a public trial with know potentially embarrassing things about you. That's rough. I wouldn't, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. And I was standing with the ultimate sentence was. But the most embarrassing thing was that he did what everybody knew he did, which was take steroids to get bigger. I mean that was the most embarrassing thing about it all right. And it wasn't anything else. It was like maybe there's some more things. So it was an ex girlfriends that were called it went on the stand in his ass.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       He got the thing that people have a problem with is that there's like legit problems in the world and they're chasing people for hitting a ball with a stick better. You know, like baseball is boring as shit. And the best part about baseball is when they hit home runs and people were saying, well these guys are doing something that makes them hit more home runs and it turns out that there's something involved science and chemicals and we don't like it. So we're going to come down on these people and we're going to spend a lot of taxpayers money. I'm going to bring these people before Congress and Joe Biden's going to get all goofy about it. That's how a lot of people felt about it. Well, I think anytime you, you could spend resources on something that's going to directly affect the youth of society and sending them a message about what is right and what is wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:06:56       You know, having grown up in a, in a sporting household myself, three daughters, which, you know, played sports growing up and I look at kind of what I went through and what my daughters have gone through in the life's lessons that you learn in sports that transcends sports and learn how to work under pressure, how to work as a team, how to individually succeed. There's so many great lessons to be learned, health aspects of being healthy and working out. All the sudden you introduce into that equation, number one, breaking the law, breaking the rules, and so there's, you know, the ethics to look at surrounding it. And number two, you know, ultimately there can be risks and health consequences with using these things, especially if you're young doing that. So, you know, again, going back to the message, I think that it's sent to our kids and two parents with where I think society was going back then with the pervasive use of, of drugs in sports.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       I think it was a positive one that's going to benefit people positively. And I think it did. It did have an impact. The landscape has changed in the last 10 or 15 years. Yeah, I think you're definitely right about that. And that is, that's the most compelling aspect of it as far as the argument for chasing it down is if kids are growing up and the kid says, Hey, I want to, I want to be a professional baseball player. How many people are going to tell that kid, look, you gotta take steroids if you want to get into a good college, if you want to get it, you know a bunch of recruiters looking at you, you got to start making some noise right now. And the way to do it is this stuff right here. Score that stuff in there. The amount of conversations I had with young athletes, baseball players, definitely cyclists where they talked about that moment that all their life growing up, you know, they aspired to be a professional and then they got to a certain point in baseball it was, you know, minor league, maybe triple a and cycling it was, hey about to get signed onto a protein going over to Europe and realizing, oh shit, to go any further.

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       I'm seeing what's going on around me here. I'm going to have to make that decision. I have had. I can't even count the number of athletes I've had sitting across the table from me recounting those days when those decisions were made that were bawling, like little babies. Talking about that. And I think a lot of it was guilt in terms of the decision that they ultimately did made, but just the pressure of, of coming to that moment either given up your lifelong dream or hey kid, if you want to go further, this is what you gotta do. And in some instances, you know, Kinda rebuffing that and not doing it. Then after year realizing, shit, I really do need to do this or I can't go any further. How many, many of those stories told to me, yeah, it is really crazy that sports like professional cycling especially. We talked about this

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       when I saw you in Brazil, that I had a buddy that was a professional cycler for awhile and he told me this was long before the Lance Armstrong stuff went down before he got caught. He said they're all doing it. He said, you can't compete at that high level. He said, not only that, but the doctor that he talked to said you could make an argument that it's actually more dangerous to compete in that sport without the drugs. And then I said, well, what kind of a fucking sport is this man? Like, this is crazy. Then after you and I had this conversation, I started looking into the Tour de France Times. We spoke about this briefly in Brazil, that the guy who was winning the Tour de France, I don't even know what his name is. He was breaking records that were set by guys that were on drugs and we were trying to figure out how the fuck that's possible.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       Yeah, it's a pit suspicious

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       a bit. I mean these are hyper human levels of performance and you know, he's beating guys that we know where the elite of the elite were also on steroids. We're also on EPO.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       Yeah, the cycling, I think we talked about this in terms of level of sophistication versus all the sports that I saw. Her drug use was prevalent, was by far at the top where they were investing in machines to bring along with them as they were competing and traveling to to test their blood every night to make sure that their levels were within reason. Wouldn't pop on a, on a drug test or a biological passport tests, um, biological passport, if I'm not mistaken. What that means is like say if we test you and we get your levels that we can test you on a regular basis and you have to stay within a consistent range. Is that the idea? Yeah, that's pretty much it. And it's something we're using in our UFC program. So you know, the more tests you have, the better you're able to read it, but over a longitudinal study of your blood and urine markers, a science and studies have shown you're going to have normal variances, you know, each human being will have a normal variants. How does that factor in with overtraining and a lot of these athletes are overtrained and that's a consistent aspect of mma camps as a guys are just really breaking themselves down, doing two and a days wrestling

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       strength and conditioning, kickboxing. It's just sometimes you see these guys testosterone levels, they come in, they're just racked and their mid camp. Yeah, that's definitely, you know, I'm not a scientist, but in talking to the scientists and read these, they take that into consideration. I think the overtraining you attend to see some of those variances on the lower side and that may be normal, but when they're reading these, you know these biological passports and you see some way on the lower side and then all of a sudden you see way one on the higher side then begins to raise questions about what's going on. Now a lot of times the biological passport will just lead to more intelligent testing or targeted testing may not necessarily be, hey, this person's definitely using, but based on these variances, something may be suspiciously going on here. Let's test this, this guy or girl, you know more hone in on suspicions like that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       And really the most accurate tests or blood tests is that the case blood are the most accurate. Correct. Do you. This is the other thing you were telling me about were in Brazil I thought was fascinating, was that there there, there's a new type of testosterone that they are making testosterone from Yams, right? Correct. That now they're doing it through animals. Yeah, they are, um, so, you know, one of the most accurate test now to use is called the carbon isotope ratio test and what that's able to do is differentiate between natural testosterone which all men and women have in their body and foreign testosterone because there's a different carbon atom in that testosterone because it's made from a plant instead of an animal. Um, there's now, at least in research supply companies, I don't think it's approved for use, but there's animal based testosterone floating around which has the potential to possibly defeat a carbon isotope ratio test because it has the same carbon atom as natural testosterone does.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       Is there any hesitation and talking about these things because you worry that you might educate cheaters? No, I don't think so. I think, you know, I've always found that, you know, your credibility rises when you're forthright about what's going on and because on the other side of things, um, you know, the sciences, you know, looking at these things and always coming up with new tests. I think something, that's fact. I just read it today. Um, and we do this in our program as well, is uh, there was in cycling, they will freeze samples both urine and blood and keep them for years at a time and cycling just recently went back and retested some of the frozen urine and blood from a few years ago for a new drug with shade, just develop a test for and they were able to catch a guy from a couple of years ago that had used it. We're going to do that in UFC as well. So even if, you know, there's a new drug out there that, you know, scientists, chemists are saying there's no test for potentially a couple of years down the line when there is a test for it, we'd have the ability to go back and that now maybe that

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       athletes no longer with the UFC are no longer competing at all anymore, but you know, they're still reputation and legacy at stake. Wow, that's crazy. So the UFC is going to have like a giant meat locker filled with old blood and p laboratories will have that. Wow, that's a, that's fascinating stuff. But doesn't that. Well, there's a chain of evidence issue with that isn't there? Which just sitting around in some sort of a lab somewhere. Yeah. There'll be secure freezers where there is a chain of custody that goes along with each sample. So outside that freezer will be guard this paperwork. No water laboratories are very secure laboratories. This. Yeah, I've tried to get in than before. It's tough. You're signing off your life to get in one of those things. But um, no. So there's, the chain of custody will be good going on indefinitely on those things.

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       So, so far as you know, this hasn't been approved where people haven't used this animal based testosterone yet. I believe it's being used now. You believe it is? Yeah. Um, there's also like wasn't an Alex Rodriguez. Is that who it was that was using a slow or quick release? Testosterone was, gets out of your system very quickly as short lifespan or short half life? Yeah. What was the deal with that stuff? It's just fast acting flax clearing testosterone. And I think, you know, the landscape on how drugs are used as changed over the last several years is tests, you know, got more accurate. And so the idea is you could take this, I think he was taking like gummies or lozenges, you know, take it at night and by morning time, you know, the testosterone could be clear your system. So you take it while you're sleeping to help you recover.

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       That's the idea behind it. Yeah. I think you see more along the lines of it's called microdosing. So small amounts where, um, you know, again, talking more of recovery versus building up massive muscles, which you saw maybe in the mid to late nineties, you saw these cartoonish figures out least on a baseball field. I think now it's evolved a little bit more where there's less amounts using more for recovery benefits. Now a guy like Jose Conseco, how much damage did he do when that guy or positive, you know, depending on how you're looking at it, when that guy came out with that book and explained what he did, what everybody he knew did. How, how illuminating was that to guys like you? Well, I mean you talked before about congressional hearings. I think his, you know, his book came out of the time when, you know, the balco case was kind of in the media and it probably caused those congressional hearings where Congress called baseball to the table and bud see, and you look now 10 years later and baseball is completely done a one 80. They, they lead sports in terms of, you know, anti-doping program, professional sports here. Well before our program came along. Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean they're testing program is, is pretty good. And compared to 10 years ago, do they, do the athletes look different? I don't follow baseball, but are they smaller guys now? I think so. I mean, I don't think you see, you know, the Mark Mcguire's

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       or the Jose Conseco Osers as prevalent as you did back then. Definitely look at the statistics. I mean those, those don't lie. You're not seeing 50, 60, 70 home runs anymore. You know? See, I'm torn. I'm torn on that because I think baseball socks and this. The only cool thing about it is when a guy wax a ball and sends it flying, I totally agree with you on the message that sends young people. I think there's a difference between that though and fighting and the difference between that and fighting clearly in my eyes is that when you are taking something and you're fighting, you can do more damage to an opponent and you kind of force your opponent to also do something if he wants to be on a level playing field. If we had a sport where it was just anything goes like the pride days now obviously we do.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       A lot of it is speculation and anecdotal evidence and and just people witness accounts from people that were there like in any. Anyway, who's been on my podcast before and talked about the pride contracts which openly stated we will not test you for steroids. That was in the contract and my own experiences with friends who went over there were there were telling them like you should take steroids. Like, uh, I have a buddy that would normally fight at 170 pounds, could even get down to 1:55. They were telling them to do steroids and get up to one 85. And he was like, what? Like he, you know, he couldn't believe it when he came back from Japan going do they told me to do steroids. And that was the wild west of the performance enhancing era where it seemed like a giant percentage of the people were on something.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       The difference being that when you're on something, if you're on EPO and testosterone and human growth hormone, all this thing and you're inside of a ring or cage, you can do more damage to your opponent. You can possibly land strikes that you would not be able to land and some of those strikes may or may not have a permanent effect on your opponent, so in a lot of people's eyes it's a much more dire and serious consequence. Then baseball, were you just hitting a ball with a stick? So in a lot of people's eyes and in my eyes, I think it's amazing that the UFC has taken this chance and done what they're doing because they really didn't have to do this. What they did is bringing a guy like you a board, you know I, I've talked to a lot of trainers nail. They raised their eyebrows and shook their heads like, oh, shit's going to be different now because they realized that this is.

Speaker 3:          00:20:07       This is a, a real big commitment to try to clean up MMA and a commitment that quite honestly, they really didn't have to do. They could have stuck with the Nevada state athletic commission protocol. The urine tests after fights, the occasional blood tests, if they wanted to do random tests on people they were suspicious of, but in a lot of people's eyes those tests were more of an intelligence test and they wore have, you know, a real honest to goodness anti-doping effort. Yeah, I'd agree with everything you just said. I'm, I'm often asked, hey, do you think steroid use in mma or the UFC is way off the chart compared to other sports? And my answer is I don't know yet.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I mean I've seen very pervasive use in other sports. I don't think it's unique to mma or UFC. What is unique is what you just talked about, the importance of it and that this isn't hitting a ball over the fence with a stick. This is two human beings getting into an octagon and trying to get the other to submit by inflicting pain and hurting them. And when you give someone, you know, an unfair and an artificially enhanced advantage over that other person, a man in terms of it just not being right. It's at a whole new level. Um, and yeah, I mean Dana and Lorenzo from the minute, you know, I had conversations with them before coming over here, jumped fully on to this and I think everybody realizes that, you know, from a business standpoint, especially short term this, this could hurt the UFC, but you know, in terms of longterm and short term health and safety of their fighters, which I'm telling you these guys are on board with. They care about their athletes. Um, I mean this speaks volumes of what they're doing. It's a big turnaround

Speaker 3:          00:21:56       also from just a few years ago where testosterone replacement therapy was sanctioned by the Nevada state athletic commission. That was a big issue that you were getting. I mean, there's no need to mention names, but I know a guy who was in his twenties who is on trt. It's like, what the fuck? If you're on testosterone replacement and you're in your twenties and you're competing in mma, you shouldn't be competing in mma if you've got a real problem. If you're at such a low level of testosterone. I'm one of the things that when I was trying to sort it out and make sense of it all, one of the things that I found most disturbing was my conversation with my friend Dr Mark Gordon, who's a famous for his work with traumatic brain injury, a lot of soldiers that have come back from getting blown up by an ids and the the impact that it has on the pituitary gland and how a lot of these guys have very low testosterone because of the impacts that they've taken and he's pretty adamant about it. He's like, if you have to take testosterone because you've been getting hit in the head too much, that the answer is not take testosterone. The answer is don't get hit in the head anymore like you. You shouldn't be like putting a patch on that and then getting right back into the octagon. If you are forced to take testosterone because of the head injuries, you shouldn't be competing anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       Yeah, I agree. I really, I can't believe how naive people were just a few years back to to allow that happen. It's just, it's amazing. How did it happen? I think just, you know, not being an educated, uh, just, just not around it enough. They didn't look into, you know, things as hard as they should have as my guest. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know either. Um, it was never approved by the Olympics. The Olympic Committee never approved. It did. They did not. I think in the history of therapeutic use exemption on the London or something, there's maybe one and I think it was literally, you know, someone

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       involved, I'm not sure, but say sailing that lost their testicles to testicular cancer and almost got to that level versus someone who, you know, urine test would show low testosterone on one or two occasions, which my understanding was alleged was being required for trt back in the day, which not only that is easy to manipulate. That's all they have to do is just be tired. Like literally all they have to do is workout really hard to a crazy workout, stay up all night, piss on in a bottle in the morning. And they're like, this poor guy got the testosterone, have a 90 year old man. But meanwhile they're manipulating it. And also it's a sign of steroid abuse because if you have taken steroids, you've wrecked your endocrine system and then you go in there and you take these tests and it shows that you're into consistent direct and like, wow, you need some steroids to fix that.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       It's crazy that that was. That was the protocol and this was a just a few years ago, we were dealing with several athletes that were competing at the highest levels of MMA and they were Jews to the tits. Yeah. And it's a good thing we're talking about being in the past because that, you know, it's not happening going forward. Our program does have a therapeutic use exemption, a possibility for athletes. So athletes can apply for certain medicines that maybe our band that an independent group that you saw to puts together a physicians and scientists will look at to determine if there really isn't a medical need. Like what would that be? Testosterone replacement theory will not be a therapy will not be one of those like adderall adderall. So someone recently, one of our fighters has some type of disease where they need medicine administered. The Niv, every month and ivy as we'll probably get to talking about here is a prohibited method under our system.

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       So they would apply for a cue saying, look, I'm using this ivy because I'd need this drug for this disease I have, so, you know, give me approval to use it and this board will look at it and determine whether or not that's needed. This is one athlete. Yeah. And this athlete needs at once a month. Yep. So when you do that, would you test them when they're not doing that drug? Whatever they need and then make sure that they haven't been using an IV bag then? Yeah, I mean that's, that's a difficult one to how you saw it is going to do it. Uh, I think they would go along with their normal testing protocol and that individual and whether or not it was, you know, hit that individual when they were using an ivy or not. If evidence of an ivy usage did come up, then they would go back and this could apply to any drug that is granted for therapeutic use exemption.

Speaker 2:          00:26:20       They then go back and look at that file for that athlete and say, Hey, looks like that athletes use Nivea all he was approved to use one under a therapeutic use exemption. Are you at liberty to say what the drug is that they have to take a. I don't remember what it was. Okay. Um, now what is the, what's the reason why they can't use an ivs to mask possible performance enhancing drugs? That's the primary reason. And I saw this, you know, we talked a little bit ago about cycling community. I saw it, you know, front and center in cycling and that they were using ivs of sailing solution to manipulate their biological passport, so to manipulate their blood level readings, which were being used to determine if they were blood doping. Um, it could also be used to flush the system. It, it dilutes blood in urine so that, you know, natural steroid steroid profiles are very hard to read after you've taken, you know, an ivy bag.

Speaker 2:          00:27:14       So that's the primary reason. Um, I think water also prohibits them for some health reasons. Um, those are many. I mean, that's, we can talk, I'm sure we're going to talk about it here, but those were on many different levels of health reasons. I think primarily, uh, you know, when an IV is administered, um, and I've talked to too many athletes that have had this happen, especially close to a competition, uh, there's a possibility of, of blown out of vain or having clotting after, you know, the [inaudible] taken out. If the idea is to rehydrate, it's much safer to do it orally. There could be some issues with, with ivy administration and a Dema, so swelling, so we're cells will not be able to get rid of fluid because they've got too much too quick. Um, I have heard of that. I have heard of that being an issue with ivy replacement and I think that was an issue with at least one UFC fighter.

Speaker 2:          00:28:08       I'm trying to remember the story, but I, I, God, I wish I could put a name to this story, but I know someone did have an issue with legal use of it back when it was approved where they got a Dema. Yeah, I, I, uh, I don't know of any current fight. I've talked to a few retired fighters who told me about problems that they had with that. I'm now, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the concern that a lot of people have is that a lot of these guys are cutting a tremendous amount of weight and some of them more than 20 pounds that cut that the day of the weigh ins, they weigh in looking like a skeleton and then 24 hours later they're supposed to engage in the most ferocious form of unarmed combat. We know of what would these guys normally would do is rehydrate with an ivy.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       They would go and they would have several bags of liquid put into their body and then they would just blow up like a balloon, come back in 24 hours later and you'd see them the next day. They didn't even look at it, the same person. They look so much bigger. I mean some guys, it was just freakish to see. You would see them rehydrated and you'd be like, Whoa, like what? How did this guy do this? They can't do that anymore. Now they have to drink the water and what are the issues with drinking the water and how hard is it going to be for these extreme weight cutting guys to rehydrate? Yeah, I mean, there there's many issues. First off, you know, studies show that orally rehydrating is better for you if you're, if you're mildly dehydrated. But what studies are they done by Gatorade? Who Does these studies? Uh, yeah, American

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       meal, now they're real American trainers association, a Sports Medicine Journal. There's many of them out there. Um, there's, there's two things that they, that they show consistently. Um, well, number one, it's obviously safer to put something through your mouth and you put it in the needle in your vein. Uh, number two, I thought was interesting is your perceived rate of exertion. So how hard do you feel you're working after rehydrating orally is less than if you rehydrate Viv. So, you know, the message we're trying to get out is, look, if you, if you rehydrate orally properly, UFC fighters, that next day you're going to feel a whole lot better when you're exerting yourself. And multiple studies have showed that, um, now that's mild dehydration, extreme dehydration, the studies do show that ivs are necessary. You probably should go to a hospital and get one if you're extremely dehydrated, that oral rehydration is not going to do it for you.

Speaker 1:          00:30:46       And in this, you know, in Wada's prohibited method policy, there is an exception to ivs where if you are administered to a hospital setting and given an ivy, it's okay. You don't need a therapeutic use exemption under our policy. You don't need to notify Usada the problem or the catch 22 there is, I think you need to notify the commission where you're fighting that you were administered to a hospital the day before your fight and they wouldn't let me not going to let you fight. Wow. So what it all comes down to, Joe, is our guys and girls need to get smarter about those weight cuts and should not be excessively dehydrating themselves the day before. Let me tell you one more thing. These studies are in their infancy of time. I'm talking to a lot of different scientists and physicians about this, but right now rehydration studies are showing that in 24 hours if you're dehydrated, seriously, you're likely not gonna fully rehydrate, whether it be orally or ivy in 24 hours, it's probably going to take more like 48 hours and the last thing to fully rehydrate is going to be the blood brain barrier, so that fluid around the head, the brain that's protecting it from hard shots.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       There's some science out there that shows that may take 72 hours to fully recover. Wow. So I mean really throw, you know, the ivy thing out the window. Even with Ivy Rehydration, you're still putting yourself in serious danger 24 hours later if you're severely dehydrated. Well, let's talk about this because your, your job as the VP of a. What is it, performance and what does the health and health and performance. What about zero way to stop weight cutting. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       look, ideally what we should do is match people up that are the same size and have them compete against other elite athletes that are the same size. Forget about all the way cutting nonsense. Let's just. What do you wait? You wait one 80. That's what you want. When you're at your optimum, you should be fighting guys that are also won 80. Let's find out who the best 180 pound person is. There's a real problem in the UFC with weight classes there. There's a giant jump in between them. There's one 85 and then there's two. Oh, five of you stand at 185 pound man next to a 205 pound man. You're dealing with 2016 ounce t-bones that's pushing that 205 pounds. Just think about the amount of mass and power that you can generate with the amount of weight they have. That extra 20 pounds. That's significant. The amount of more power that they could possibly generate, the amount of, you know, just the ability to pick you up when they maybe couldn't if they were just 20 pounds less. The ability to push out of a lock, to, to break out of a submission, to, to break out of a clench. That's significant and when you have these big giant gaps, it's encouraging people to make these extreme weight cuts because they want to be the big guy in the division.

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       I agree with you. I agree with you with all of that. Hopefully Viv ban and you know, kind of those statistics I was quoting earlier in those studies will have an effect on things and, and, and cause, you know, our athletes, um, trainers support to take a look at that. Uh, I can give you examples of ncaa wrestling in the late nineties had an issue with a bad issue with weight cutting and last three wrestlers in one year, two Saunas, plastic suits, things. When you say last they die, they died. Yeah. A NCA went to the extreme and band. She's most weight cutting practices. They banned plastic suits, Saunas, things like that. Um, they adapted and became much more safer. The Ivy ban went into effect after water past, I think 2012. And that effected severely Olympic boxing in Olympic wrestling. We're doing weight cuts, you know, similar to what an amazing experience now.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       But they, those sports have much smaller weight classes. True. I think they do. I think that every 10 pounds, right? Yeah. Um, well I mean, but there was, I think initially kind of similar to what we're talking about here. A Lot, a lot of pushback from the athletes about, you know, this isn't fair, this isn't right, this is going to be unsafe, adapted pretty quickly and it's become a thing of the past here. So I think, you know, in terms of what we're going and where we're going, I'm constantly just trying to be a sponge and absorb, you know, studies, science, medicine, pass it along to our fighters, pass it along internally with UFC. Um, and, you know, let's see where it goes. There's, as I said earlier, my position and I think the position of leadership is always

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       with a health and safety of our fighters, you know, at the forefront. Um, so it'd be an issue that, you know, personally I'll definitely always be looking at have you had the conversation with them whether or not there will be additional weight classes. I haven't talked about that specifically, but you know, have talked about what this issue of the Ib band's gonna mean and some of the statistics and stories that we're hearing about weight cutting, I'm definitely sharing that with, with everybody that I think that's hugely important, but there has to be some sort of an option for these people. And for someone who's like say Chris Weidman, Weidman's a big guy, I mean, he's very to the fact that he makes one 85 is shocking enough. I saw him when he cut weight on a short notice to make one 85 for Damien Maia and he looked like death.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       I mean he was on death's door when he weighed in and then the next day went out and won just by sheer toughness and will and skill and just the fact that he's that Kinda guy. But that's, that's because he cut a lot of weight. I mean, that's how he made that weight. And then then he fought the next day and he was definitely depleted. You could see in his performance. I mean, he won a decision against my, uh, buddy look sluggish. And you just push through just through sheer toughness. A guy like him was the champ at one 85. If all of a sudden weight cutting starts getting banned. I mean he's walking around. I, I'd have to guess at least 20 pounds heavier than that. At least. What does a guy like that too? He's the champion. If he can't make the one 85 weight class anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       So you just move up to two. Oh, five. Yeah, that's, that's an interesting tough question. I think, you know, these, these are the toughest guys and girls on the planet and just able to put themselves through unhuman, uh, pain and suffering both in the ring and I think through the weight cutting. Um, so, you know, I don't know the answer to that right now other than, you know, educate and share as much information. I'm not a big believer and throwing a million rules at people. I think you take things one step at a time. Let's see. With the [inaudible] band does, let's see, kind of what the education that we're providing our athletes does. And you know, all was reevaluated month to month, year to year. I just think that there should be some sort of an option for these guys. I mean the, the idea that they have a 20 pound weight jumped between one 85 and two.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       Oh five. And then there's a big one is two. Oh, five, two to 65. I mean that is fucking crazy. There's a lot of guys that are small heavyweights or just dehydrated light heavyweights and they have to figure out what to do about something like that. I really think the UFC needs many more weight classes and they've resisted that. They think it waters the sport down like it does with boxing. But I think it creates more champions and more champions creates the possibility of more champion versus champion fights. I just think that these, these gaps, if you're going to institute this no ivy thing and you're going to change the whole system of weight cutting, it got to give these people some options. Yeah, we'll see where it goes. It's not, you know, other than the ivs being used to defeat drug tests, which is in my past experience a new issue for me that, you know, I'm learning on a day to day basis.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       So, uh, what about athletes and camp? Are they allowed to use an Ivn camp? Like what if they have a particularly brutal day in the Hot Sun? They go run up hills and they come back and their doctor says, listen man, you're really fucking dehydrated. We would like to get an IV bag in you. Can they call you guys up and say, Hey, we have an athlete that, uh, he just did a two a day and didn't know, did hill sprints and we would really like to get this kid in ivy again, in a, in a hospital administration setting. They can do it. Don't even need to notify us. That may be an instance where they would want to do it because then they wouldn't have to tell, you know, the commission. Um, if there was no fight coming up soon, but wouldn't that be something that could potentially manipulate?

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       It could, but you know, they could manipulate. Yeah, but uh, their blood levels, absolutely, but you know, hey, it's a balancing act. If somebody is really truly that dehydrated and needs one, you know, even if it can be used to manipulate a blood test, if it's for their health and safety because there are so severely dehydrated, then you know, the policy is made to so as not to stop that. Now, uh, Andy Foster, who's the head of the California State Athletic Commission, has done a fantastic job here in California. I'm a big fan of this guy and he's just aggressively going after drug doping and tested a lot of people on the UFC card here. I believe he tested everyone. Um, and you just, who got popped, I think they gave him a three year period. That's, that's extreme. I mean that, that is sending a big, big message. Do you think that that's the kind of stuff that has to be done?

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       Like it has to be so extreme that if you have to have a few sacrificial lambs, were the rest of the athletes have to go, look, this is my fucking career. You know, if you want to really compete, this is the way you're going to have to do it. You, you can't take any chances because we're not talking about nine months anymore, which is not that bad for fighter because the reality is they're not going to fight more than once every six months anyway. So they get, you know, at an elite level. It's very rare that a guy like say a Vito Belfort fights more than once every six months at the most. You might fight three times a year. Right? So the guy takes a few extra months off. Not that big a deal. Three years. It's kind of the end of your career. Yeah, I agree with you 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:40:57       There needs to be the deterrent effect upfront and that's one of the reasons I think our policy is so strong. It's our policy first time is too, but if there's aggravating circumstances and that would be quantified as say somebody was found to take a steroid and did an ivy bag just before the test and we found out about that. That could be an aggravating circumstance and possibility of four years, which, you know, as we get out and educate our fighters. I, I, you know, I, I talk about those terms and I asked who thinks to definitely for is a career ender. Most of them heads bobbing up and down mean unless you're on the

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       absolute top of the UFC, you know, food chain for years, for years as you're done long past. I mean if you get popped at 34, then you come back, you 38, that's crazy. It's not going to happen. It's just not. I mean, if it does happen, you'll be severely diminished and the likelihood of you being mean, you're going to be off the sauce now too. Like you were probably doing something so your, your system has to recover, you know, you're. Then there's also the mental aspect for a lot of these guys. There's a lot of these fighters that were fighting enhanced for most of their career and they have this mental advantage of fighting, enhance where they know they're juiced up and it gives them all this confidence. Then all of a sudden you take that away and they just don't seem to be the same guys.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       Yeah. You know, it's really interesting on the mental side of things, and you know, I didn't. I learned this kind throughout my previous career. Talking to athletes is the mental effort that it takes to use drugs when you're under a good solid anti-doping system. Many athletes say, hey, despite the performance benefits I was getting from these drugs, I definitely felt stronger. Could go longer. What it took to figure out what drugs to take, how long they were going to clear my system, worry after I took a drug was shit or the tests is going to come tomorrow morning. That mental burden for a lot of these athletes far outweighed the physical enhancement they were getting. That's a good point. As an endless amount of stress, could you imagine? I mean our, our policy, you're going to be tested. The ability to be tested 365 days a year.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       You know, an athlete who would choose to use something that night, that athlete use something. Can you imagine like listening for that doorbell or that warnock all night long? All morning long. There was some athletes I talked to that had surveillance systems up where they would literally at night after taking a dose be looking at their television screens and shit's coming down. It's crazy now. A huge mental tasks and they can't hide either. Right. It's not like you could just go to palm beach and take a hotel room and camp out. You have to like let the UFC know where you are all the time. Yeah, so we have a whereabouts program and so that requires our athletes on a quarterly basis to fill out whereabouts, where they're going, where they can be located, where they're staying overnight, regularly scheduled activities that they have during the day so that if you saw to who's administrating our program, wants to go out and find that athlete they can do that now.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       Doesn't include. It doesn't include our involved. Twenty four slash seven. Whereabouts are athletes don't need to let you saw to know where they're going to be at all times if they're going out to a movie or the supermarket or something like that. It doesn't mean that it just means if you saw to, chooses on a day or night to go locate one of our athletes, they have an idea of where to go find them and can find them within a reasonable amount of time. I was having a conversation with a to keep this as vague as possible. Um, I was having a conversation with an athlete who was telling that he knew of

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       an athlete that was not clean. And then so this athlete decided to go overseas and train, just decided to like go hang out in some other country and train there for awhile. What do you do if someone says, you know, hey, I'm going to go train and Thailand. You guys going to go fly out to Thailand and, and test them.

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       It's one of the reasons we hired you, saw that you saw to, has partnerships with international, uh, anti-doping agencies all across the world. I mean, that's, that's their job. They're constantly going to conferences, they're going out and training collection officers from other international bodies. So they do, they have the ability to reach out anywhere in the world because our population of athletes is spread across the world and get a test taken or a sample taken from them at any time.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       Well, let's, let's just say like, I mean, I'm not, uh, not accusing anybody of anything but let's just say if you were an unscrupulous athlete and you had ties to maybe people who also do unscrupulous things and they had a reasonable amount of power in a certain country, um, and you could just go there and they kinda had deals with people and they, uh, they said, look, you know, we're, we're going to give you a blood sample and we're going to give you a urine sample, but we just like you to wait here for a moment and we'll just go in the other room and we come back with this stuff and they come back and they give it to these guys. It, are you getting like video tape of this happening? Are you making sure you're seeing the exact athlete put the exact blood in the exact thing, like how were you going to make sure that there's no fuckery, no shenanigans going on, especially in other countries?

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       Yeah. So there's a certain standard, no matter which country the collection's going onto a of how these, how these collections happen and the doping collection officer, the, the DCO has to physically witness the athlete providing the sample. Uh, whether it be urine or blood test, they have to.

Speaker 3:          00:46:28       How do you prove that they did that? Like if you're dealing with someone like I said in another country, how do you prove that this, uh, this commissioner guy actually was there?

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       Well, I mean these, you know, the Dcos are trained, uh, based on worldwide collection standards and um, you know, they're vetted before they're hired. I mean that, that could happen anywhere Joe could happen in this country or another country. Um, but I like, you know, Erika better than I like other countries, so like to talk shit about them. I think part of it will be, okay, so the laboratory gets these samples, you know, we're, I think we're doing 2,700 to 3000 tests a year. You start looking at samples, you know, from a particular country, whether it be the United States in a certain region or another country, and you start seeing suspicion in that sample. Um, you start seeing Aaron variances in the biological passport and collections done in another country versus when, you know, maybe they come here to the United States, things like that. So it's a constant detective game going on and there's,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       you know, things put in place for every conceivable situation to try to, to try to detect that it's his seems like, um, you're going to catch them. It just seems like there's only so much, so much wiggle room these guys have these days, but are there any things that are on your radar that could possibly be used to cheat that we're not aware of yet that most people aren't aware of? Like the testosterone that's being done with animals? I never heard about that before. Is there anything else like that that's going on right now? That's why I can't give you any specific example, but I will give the example of cyclists that just got caught for the drugs still in a clinical trial and what the anti-doping with that shows, what the anti-doping community has been doing is reaching out to the pharmaceutical industry and saying and querying, hey, any drugs that you have, you know, in clinical trial or to being developed, do you see any potential for athletic performance enhancing benefits?

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       And if the pharmaceutical industry. I said, yeah, you know, this particular drug was, it was called oxygen and a pill, so you take it and create more red blood cells similar to hipo but in an oral form. And so the pharmaceutical industry obviously told anti-doping, now this is coming out. Anti-Doping community was able to develop a test kind of secretly and use the test and caught somebody's oxygen in a pill. So it was called. Yup. Wow. So it's essentially the same thing as epo or works in a different way. My understanding essentially the same thing. It causes your body to produce more red blood cells which carry more oxygen and can replenish your muscles quicker. Now here's the rub on that. Okay. Obviously that's an illegal substance and it should be banned, but what about guys who trained at altitude? What about guys who, who sleeping altitude tense?

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Like I remember on one of the countdown shows, Bj Penn was sleeping in this crazy zip-up tent and one of the things he said, Bj Penn's accent, he goes, you know what? I'm sleeping in a plastic tent. Someone's getting their ass kicked because yes, the zip up this fucking tent to sleep in it to simulate that he's at 10,000 feet or these sleeping there. Um, there's all sorts of other things like a scent of you, you're aware of those altitudes machines that they use at very, the altitude. It's like A. I know I'm a Ian Mccall is a big fan of those. He said they have tremendous effects. A cryogenic chambers. I'm a huge fan of those. They have massive effects on inflammation, massive effects on the neo Pranav friend, a cold shock proteins, all these different things that help you heal and reduce inflammation and help you train more the.

Speaker 2:          00:50:08       If you could do what that could do in a pill form, it might be illegal, right? Yeah, and you know, I don't, I, I hear the argument of, Hey, isn't that cheating getting in an oxygen tent, but I don't buy off that. That's the same thing as taking a drug that manipulate the hormones and steroids in your body. I think what ego, I mean, isn't it exactly the same. I mean if you, if you take gpo doesn't do exactly the same thing as sleeping at altitude, but I think it does, but it does it in a quicker forum. You don't have to put forth the effort of sleeping in an oxygen tent every night for a period of weeks or months. It's instantaneous. I'm not on the side of EPO. Don't get me wrong. I don't think you should be allowed to take it. And I think as far as I know, the only fighter that has been popped for in the UFC was Ali bag off, which shows you how impressive Demetrius Johnson's cardio is.

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       He outworked that guy who was on epo at the time. But if, if he's taken that and that's illegal, but he gets the exact same benefit as someone who's sleeping in an oxygen tent, why is it more difficult? I just don't. Why is that legal? I don't think you get the same exact benefit. I think it's way more extreme. Um, and using the drug you can get your love. I mean, I've seen some hermatocrit levels of some athletes get up in the mid fifties, 60 years. What's a normal number of adequate levels? The amount of red blood cells per blood volume. Normal numbers are 42 percent, maybe on the high end, 47 or 48 percent. Um, I've seen them again in the mid fifties to sixties and we start talking about him. Adequate levels of those amounts. There's so many red blood cells per blood volume that your blood becomes thick.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       Tar like, and I think we saw this with cyclists in the mid nineties that just discovered epo and we're using it. They were dropping dead in their mid twenties because of having strokes because their blood became so thick that any small little blockage, the blood couldn't get through and stops circulating. You've got instances where they were setting their alarms in the middle of the night and to get up and drink water and do pushups and exercise to make sure that their blood was, was still flowing for fear of it slowing down and stopped flowing in the middle of the night. So you can extremely increase hematocrit levels via using drugs like this versus you know, training at oxygen and oxygen tents. I think maybe you can get up a little bit higher into that, that normal range and the 47 or 48 percent, but I haven't seen extremes of getting into mid fifties and sixties from that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:47       Yeah. My friend who was on the cycling team said that he would hear, they were, they would be on a tour, a sleeping in a bus, and you would hear guys get up in the middle of the night and hear their bike come off the rack and they'd go riding because they had to. Yeah, because their heart would start beating funky and they'd be like, Oh shit. And they. They literally are producing so much blood that they had to burn some of it off. That's terrifying. Yeah. I don't know if it's burning it off. It's just keeping it circulating internally, but also the fact that these are the same guys who are taking this stuff. I'm not the. The cyclists were obviously, but fighters, they would get hit. You're going to get hit, you're going to get a lot of bruising and bruising is essentially just internal bleeding. I mean that's

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       what you're getting. When you used to look at a guy's leg and he gets leg kicked a bunch and you see these big welts and black and blue all over his legs. That's blood. He's bleeding. It's clotting up inside of his leg. But he's bleeding and swelling when a guy's on epo, is there a more significant danger when when something like that's going on, if you are bleeding like that or if your a bruising?

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       Yeah, I think so. Again, I'm not a scientist, but common sense will show you if you had more, lot more red blood cells floating around that are, that are able to clot, then yeah, you're likely running that risk. It's just amazing what people are willing to risk just to win. It sure is. It's certainly, that's been a lesson that I'm just, I'm not surprised anymore. You know, there's, you see a lot informal questionnaires, interviews of athletes. If you could give up a couple of years in your life, you know, and there was a pill that would allow you to win an Olympic gold medal that you had to give up, you know, four or five years and your life would you. And typically you see the answers to that overwhelmingly. Yes. Um, and I think a lot of it is athletes are a little bit younger and their mid, early twenties feeling invincible at that time.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       Who's thinking about five years on the end of your life then, and I think, you know, a lot of the decision making of, of taking some of these performance enhancing drugs occurs then, um, were you feel young and invincible and who cares what you have to pay 20 or 30 years down the line, uh, for making a decision now. Yeah. And there's also a bunch of athletes that are putting money in the bank of medical technology and innovation and they're like, look, one day they going to fix this. Let me just take the shit now. And then five, 10 years from now, they'll just build me a new liver. Yeah, yeah. I'm a, you know, one thing, people were kind of surprised that this is my opinion. Uh, but I understand a lot of times why these decisions are made. There's such temptation financially. There's still, there's such incentive out there financially and a lot of these sports, um, there's such pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       I don't know what the word is, distrust of their competitors or teammates that they all feel that, that are using something. There's a lot of distrust of sports governing bodies that they really don't feel that they care because they're programs aren't solid at. So I've had, I've had so many of these athletes really surprised that I say, Hey, I understand why I made that decision. I get it. As opposed to, you know, well you do and you should never have done that. So you do the good cop. I do. I mean, I genuinely feel that. I like to think that I wouldn't make that decision, but health. I was in my early twenties, mid twenties. I don't know. I couldn't sit here and tell you that and if you're in the culture of, you know, you're in these camps and everyone in the camp is using you most likely would have a problem. If you weren't where people wouldn't trust you or

Speaker 3:          00:56:13       now they would be more likely to turn on you or you'd have a problem with training with these people. And there's A. There's this culture of comradery that comes with fight camps, especially where these

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       guys have to trust each other because they're beating the shit out of each other on a daily basis and they have to trust that they're hitting each other at 60, 70 percent, not 100 percent, and that they are trying to work and help each other. Have you had resistance from any camps in particular? No. Outwardly, no. It's all been positive. A lot of questioning on the ivy issue, so maybe quantify a little bit of resistance there in terms of the anti-doping. Overwhelmingly, hey, good for you guys. This is great and I don't know if that's some of that's lip service or not, but I'm guessing that even those athletes that have chosen in the past to use that, a lot of them are like, thank God I don't. This decisions now made for me. I don't have to be making this decision anymore. I'm now.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       There's something in place where I can trust that my sport really does care about me. I can trust that, hey, if my opponent is using, he's risking at least his career, you know, go down the tubes so I can begin to trust that who I'm fighting is clean or just being really stupid. We had this conversation in Brazil about Vituro Belfort's levels. Uh, when he was tested during this camp for Chris Weidman. Vito Belfort was a guy who was on testosterone replacement because he allegedly had low testosterone and you know, he was making it out like he was a martyr and he needed medicine because, you know, he was sick and he had an issue and even compared it to someone being a diabetic and needing insulin, you have to give them their insulin, which I thought was disingenuous and in a lot of ways is kind of a crazy thing to say when everybody knows.

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       It's not a mystery that he used to be 240 pounds and he's 19 years old. It's not a mystery that he was on testosterone replacement and looked like a fucking gorilla. And then during camp he tests three times higher than Weidman. Weidman's tests at 300 Vittorio test at 1200 and everybody was like, well, what the fuck is going on? You know, it wasn't a. What am I saying? The numbers, right? It was a four times higher or it was 900, 1200, 1200, right. I think I was right. Okay. So he's four times higher. Right. And he tells, you know, Weidman tells him, you know, I'm going to punish you. I know you were using in camp, I'm going to punish you. But you were saying that it's not necessarily the case and that when someone tests at 1200 through a urine test, explain that. How has. Yeah. And I actually relied on experts to kind of guide me through this, but urine results like that, uh, are depend on, I think it's called your excretion level. Different people excrete out in urine, different levels of testosterone depends a lot on your metabolism. One person could be a high excreta and one person could be a low Iq screener. It's not necessarily a representation of your true testosterone levels. We've talked about earlier. Blood tests would be

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       way more accurate. So why test him for urine at all? Well, I mean, I think the urine test is done because it's a little bit cheaper. They could initially look at the testosterone to epitestosterone ratio. That is a pretty true marker and you're in the amount of testosterone that you have to epitestosterone. The levels can barely vary depending on how you're excluding out, but that ratio, you know, we'll stay will be very accurate of what's in your body. Normal human has a one to one ratio. There are some variances on the positive and on the plus and negative side. And if you look at what vittores ratio was there, it was within normal range. Now you, but you allow up to four to one in Nevada. Is that still the case with the way the UFC has? This new program is still four to one because he was six to one at one point in time that was criticized and it was dropped down to four to one.

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       So that's gone out the window a little bit. Um, the ratio is looked at to determine whether or not you go to a more accurate backup tests called we talked about earlier, the carbon isotope ratio tests. So in all cases you know, if, if, if a test proves high over whatever the number is, three to one, four to one, six to one than the termination is usually made. Hey, let's go to the definitive test carbon isotope to determine whether or not that's foreign based testosterone and if it is foreign based testosterone, how much of a time, like once you get the test results, like say if you test a guy and his urine tests are kind of Funky, he's reading really high and then you decide to go to a blood test. If he's doing something like Alex Rodriguez was doing where it's like quick release or how would you describe it?

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       Quick, quick half live, what would you describe it? Yeah, fast acting fast. Ach Clearing, fast clearing. How would you, how would you mitigate that? So ask the question again. So you do the. So you do the one test and shows that he's got a very high level 1200. Um, and then you want to, you want to do a blood test, not necessarily you could go right to that same urine sample and do a different test or cir test on that. So it can be. So you don't do that. Ordinarily the carbon isotope is not done immediately in our, in our program. It will be, that will be as opposed to, you know, hey, let's do the testosterone epitestosterone ratio tests first. In some cases we'll go right to the Usada, we'll go right to the CIO, our test and bypass the t ratio. And that is because of the micro dosing issue.

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       So say like an Alex Rodriguez took a fast acting testosterone, didn't really manipulate his tat level too much if you were just doing that test would show a two or three to one maybe and in the past and say, okay, well he's good. He's under four to one or six to one. Um, where if a car test was done on that, they would have known right away that he was using. So under our program, oftentimes the cir tests will be done right away regardless of what the t ratio is. Okay. So if you are doing with Alex, Rodrigo was. Rodriguez was doing, even if he tests okay. Within his boundaries and normal levels, you can do a cir test and catch him even though it's out of a system. Well, no, no. If it's out of his system, it's out of his system. But if it's a four hour thing, that's true.

Speaker 1:          01:02:33       Is that actually the level. I mean, it really is gone for hours. I mean, that's what they say. I'd be a little bit hesitant if I was an athlete to depend on, you know, I had a drug test in five hours. It's, something's going to clear in four hours. They can detect pretty minute amounts, but my understanding is it does clear pretty quickly and you're going to ask guys in the middle of the night, uh, the side, it has the ability to do that. I don't think they're gonna, you know, make that routine. But if, again, this is all detective work, if they're looking at biological passports over time and see variances between mornings and evenings, they could get a tip or other information that's, you know, non science related. Just a tip from somebody that, hey, this is what's going on in this camp. They'd had the ability to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:18       Yes. I'm a tip. Has that happened before? Do you guys have tips from people like the fighters are using? There's a uh, so actually you saw it. It has a hotline or a tip line that's given dollar athletes, you know, here's something about something going on from somebody or a camp they can anonymously call and lead that. And you look back at, you look back at all of the major performance enhancing drug cases that have come out over the past 15 years. You look at Belko, you look at Biogenesis, uh, you look at Kirk Radomski, who in New York, mets, bat boy that was distributing to athletes. There's a bat boy. He was, he was a clubhouse attendant. The back boy was getting them dressed or was. Wow. How they catch him. Was He in jail now? Uh, he is, uh, he's a convicted felon. I think he's done with probation.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       Um, but all of those cases, all the major cases that have happened over the last decade, decade and a half all were a result of investigations not necessarily anti-doping side of things. And you sorta who we're using is aware of that. They actually have someone on their staff, former law enforcement who's investigator that will liaison and reach out to various law enforcement agencies both here in the United States and internationally so that say another case comes out and local law enforcement agency goes in and does a search warrant and they find, you know, list of UFC athletes of what drugs they were getting or being distributed. You saw it would have the ability hopefully to go to law enforcement said, hey, when you're done kind of with the criminal side of things here, can you give us, find a way to give us some of your evidence, use it here and uh, and use it that way. So again, Joe, we're just trying to. Our program has every resource available that we know of science wise, investigative lies to create that deterrent effect. So athlete, you may have found the newest, latest, greatest, greatest strug that they will never be a test for, but you're running

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       the risk of whoever's getting that for you at some point, you know, running along to some investigation and that information out and catching you on the back door. It's, it's definitely happened a lot in the past. And is that what happened with Bronco? It was. So Balco was a criminal investigation, uh, first, um, and what we did there was interfaced with anti-doping. So we discovered drugs in balco that were designer drugs that they were, weren't tests for, and through the back door went to anti doping and said, hey, here's what we've got. We're trying to figure out who palcos clients are, what they're using. If, when we bring them in, they're telling us the truth about what they've used. So the anti-doping side of thing was able to develop tests for these drugs, go out and test some of these athletes, both current samples provided and samples that were frozen and leftover from previous provisions and kept some of those athletes for the drugs they were using.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       They then pass that information back along to us so that when we go out and question athlete and they say, I, I didn't use anything we will to say you're full of shit now. When you say it was a criminal investigation first, what was the crime? So actually that was back in my days, I was a irs special agents. So it involved a financial crime and money laundering. So the taking of profits from Doug drug distribution and putting them back in the financial system. Oh right. Because they have to have some way to account for the money. Correct. Right. Because you're making all these might look good. How much does a guy like barry bonds pay for for steroids to a guy like Victor Conte, like how much does that work? He was interesting because he didn't pay anything. He paid in the form of giving. Advertise and it was really an ingenious plan instead of, you know, in exchange for what I'm giving you, you give me back money, do advertising for my supplement company, go in magazines and ads and say, Hey, you work with me and my supplements and they're the reason for your success, like cma and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:07:13       Who knows what the value of that was of that. Advertise for a guy bonds millions. It's really an engine. It was an ingenious plan. Money Laundering plan. I've had content here and Dana White fucking hates that guy, but I found them to be a pleasant individual. I didn't have a problem with him and he was very forthright. He was very honest about what he did and how he got away with it and what he thinks is going on right now. A lot of people are suspicious of him of course, because I mean he's now like working as an anti performance enhancing drugs advocate when he became famous for being a guy who provided performance enhancing drugs to athletes. It's a weird sort of turnaround late in life and people or they're suspicious and rightly so, but what he has, what he has done is at least illuminates what he was able to pull off.

Speaker 2:          01:08:07       Yeah. I'm asking about him often and I always say, Hey, I, I welcome anybody over to, to the good side. You believe him. I'm a firm believer in second chances. I think you have to have to take everything he says with a little bit of grain of salt. Um, I read something the other day that he still keeps a hand in kind of the dark world and that's where we learned about all this stuff. And if you're truly, if you're truly an anti-doping advocate and you know about things going on in the dark world and you're not exposing who those people are, then you're really not truly an anti-doping advocate, but a [inaudible] guy's a character. I mean, I enjoyed. He's one of those guys and in my former career you run into a lot of characters like that and I enjoy everything about those people.

Speaker 2:          01:08:50       It's just living life and running into characters like that. Whether in a good or bad way. Fun. You enjoy it because it's part of like the flavor of the Gig. Absolutely. And also because you're a pretty straight edge guy, you know, like people are living on the edge like that. It's always fun to see how the other side lives. I don't trust anybody with a fucking mustache like that. I'll tell you that when you get one of them little skinny mustaches, there's just very few people that I trust. Maybe a couple of black eyes, maybe some people of Puerto Rican descent and have a little skinny mustache, but I dunno content that you've seen his mustache. Yeah. It's a psalm about that mustache and makes me go, hmm. You know, I just hope at some point when, because he does. He's got a bit of a platform, you know, still a lot of tell you had them in here without mustache.

Speaker 2:          01:09:38       Get out of here dog. Come on son. I'm waiting for it. You know, he's been critical of me. I'm waiting for. I'm waiting for a thank you from him for him. Vocal to the good side. What's his criticism in A. I don't even know, don't listen to it, don't listen to it really good for you. Um, Aldo, Josie, although has said that he won't do the Ivy or that he won't listen to the band on Ivs, he's going to take it and he said they'll still let me fight. You know, what do you think about that? Actually, when we were in Brazil a couple of weeks ago, had a conversation with them about that and you said it was just one of those days where he was in a certain mood, uh, maybe a little bit joking, maybe a little bit pissed off about something else and said those things and said he shouldn't have.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       Doesn't believe those, you apologize for doing that. And uh, so I felt pretty good at conor mcgregor felt that way. Crawl inside that Dude's head and camped out, planted flags shit all over the place. I mean, that guy was dealing with some serious psychological warfare at a level that I don't think he had ever experienced before. It was. Connor is really good at that, isn't he? He's the best. He's the best. It's like he took Mohamad Ali and chill Sunnen and he rolled it up in this crazy Celtic warrior character. It just and just. And He's good. That's the thing. He's not just trash-talker, he's fucking dangerous. It's a once in a lifetime personality and he pulls it off consistently. He's always on his game. Well, the fact that it was willing to Bet Dana and Lorenzo, $3,000,000, it would knock Mendez out in the second round and he knocked Mendez out in the second round.

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       I mean, he's a fucking freak. He really is. He's a freak. I wonder if it, if it comes naturally or you sits. It sits around at night plotting these things out. So damn good at it. Well, he was always a very good fighter. I was a big fan of his when he was competing in Europe and you know, he's fighting in the UK and quite an actually I tweeted him way back in the day before he ever came to the UFC saying that I enjoy his fights and I hope he gets over here. And then boy, did he get over here. Jesus Christ. I mean that UFC wayans when he fought Mendez was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life of all the fights that have ever called all the weigh ins that I've ever been at. I have never seen anything like that in America.

Speaker 2:          01:11:54       And it was like we were in Dublin, so it's amazing. I'm, I'm four months into this, so I'm a Newbie, so I expect that now. Don't know. That was, that was a total outlier. I've never seen any expected. If he fights again though, in a bigger way in December when he fights, although Jesus Christ, that's going to be crazy if, although makes it to it without getting injured and he makes it to it without getting injured. Which is a big problem with this sport. You know, if you look at boxing matches, boxing matches that get arranged and how many of them actually come to fruition? It's most of them, most fights gets scheduled. They'd come and they, they actually, they come to pass with the UFC. It's, it's maybe 70 percent, you know, maybe 70 May. I mean, I might be wrong, but if I had to guess like big fights, 75 at the most, 25 percent of them fall out.

Speaker 2:          01:12:40       It seems like just. It's interesting, it's another, it's lagging behind a little bit, the anti-doping side, because that's taken up so much of my time, but it's another responsibility under my title is to try to provide our athletes reach out, provide them with other resources. In terms of training, rehabilitation. We've reached out to a couple of companies here domestically, exos, which there's a lot of training for NFL exos or out of what does that x o, s and what do they do? Their training facility? Yeah, so they, they are most widely known from taking shoot. If you look at most of the first round draft picks in the NFL, they've gone and trained at exos from, you know, their end of their last season in college through the combine and they've just instituted good nutrition, good training methods. We've contracted with them a couple months ago, sent a couple athletes down there.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       Um, I think Rashad Evans went down a forest, went down kind of from an internal perspective, look at things. I think Luke rockhold went down their cm, punk is retired. He is, and he went down there to look at experience week of training. So the idea is to get our athletes to train smarter, to listen to their bodies, to uh, you know, give them techniques and proper nutrition, things like that. So that as our guys are training smarter, listening to their bodies better, there will be less instances of getting injured. You know, coming up to big fights in the UFC is developing some sort of a performance

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       center, correct?

Speaker 1:          01:14:13       Correct. We are that, I think they're breaking ground pretty soon on that, but the idea would be through consulting with these other companies that had been in the business of training high level athletes to putting all these resources and tools and machines and space available to this state of the art world class facility that our athletes would have the ability to come to and train to come to an rehabilitate. Not only UFC athletes, but I think the idea is to make this place so state of the arts that we would welcome in athletes from other sports that, hey, this is the world class place to go to your training and learn how to do your training and a similar that as we're doing with our anti-doping program, hoping to lead the pack. The idea is to lead the pack in terms of how we teach our athletes that train.

Speaker 3:          01:15:05       Is there a consensus though on the correct way to train as far as strength and conditioning goes as far as like how much time to spend doing skill work versus how much time to spend during endurance work. There seems like there's a lot of debate and then there's a lot of athletes very as far as their needs, their style of fighting. Like how would you manage something like that?

Speaker 1:          01:15:29       Yeah. That's a tough one for me that I'm a be the first to admit. Just learning and coming up to speed. I mean, you probably know better and your involvement in mma and what it feels like to train in which you would need to do in your training to be able to ready to get into a real fight a month or a couple of weeks later. I'll turn that back around on you. What do you think in terms of how close to a fight these guys need to be going full speed so that when they get in that octagon, it's not a shock to the system like holy shit

Speaker 3:          01:15:56       going on? Well, it depends on who you ask because there's a lot of people that I respect that very wide wildly on how they approach things like you'll. You'll talk to one guy who's a strength and conditioning coach and he has this very specific idea of how you should train and then another guy who was also very well respected but completely different methodology. I'm a big fan of what Marv Marinovich was able to do with Bj Penn and the amount of work that he did with Bj's endurance. I think that Bj during that time was just one of the greatest of all time during the time we fought to Diego Sanchez and Sean Sherk and when Bj was in his prime and I know during the Diego Sanchez fight in particular was an absolutely brutal camp for him and he went and worked with him for only a couple of fights because it was so, so goddamn brutal, but a lot of people think and nick curse on who was a protege of Marinovich.

Speaker 3:          01:16:51       I've had him on the podcast. We discussed it pretty, pretty deep and he thinks and I liked the way he thinks. He believes that strength and conditioning during camp is everything and that's really what you should primarily focus on. That these guys already know how to fight and that really they should be putting almost all of their effort into conditioning. Getting their body to the point where their body can perform at an extremely high level for five rounds, five minutes each and that all the other skill work and everything like that should actually take a back seat to conditioning. Because what you're dealing with when you're dealing with a championship level fight like that is an athlete that's so finely tuned in skill wise already that really what you need to do is give them the horsepower and give him the gas tank and that also would, that also would do is it would prevent the really hard training that is breaking guys down like the really hard wrestling training that's breaking guys down.

Speaker 3:          01:17:44       Instead of doing that, you would just drill and instead of doing these hard sparring drills, you would just drill. Matter of fact, Tim Kennedy was just on the fighter and the kid podcast with Brian Kaylin and Brendan Schaub and Brendan texted me last night and said that Kennedy said he doesn't spar, said he just doesn't spark city moves around with guys and he just does strength and conditioning work and everything like that. He said, but the sparring, like if you take enough punishment fighting, so he's. He's of the mindset that you shouldn't be beating yourself up in the gym. So I think there's a lot of variation there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:16       Yeah, I agree. I think that's something that exos promotes, is that it depends on, you know, an athlete, individual to individual, some are, are different than others. One thing that they did tell us was they were just amazed and getting back to kind of the weight cutting thing that an athlete who's going to compete 24 hours later, it's putting their body through such extreme conditions just 24 hours before and the fact that that's going to have on your performance when you do an extreme cut and then put that weight back on. Um, and that, you know, during the off season when you don't have a fight scheduled and you're maybe even 20 pounds heavier than that, you know, the muscle memory of getting used to working out at that 20 pounds heavier than you're actually going to be fighting a doesn't seem to make a lot of common sense because you're fighting is a completely different feel and person and muscle mass. Um, that, that, that, you know, training wise doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. So I don't know, again, I'm new to all this and trying to be as a sponge and absorb everything and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:19:17       yeah, I've seen the horror stories. I've seen guys cut too much weight, just fight like shit. And I've seen guys that really blew their opportunity of being champion. The best example that I've ever used as Travis Luder, Travis Luder. It was one of the best American black belts in Brazilian Jujitsu, especially at the time. He was just extremely high level black belt, very, very technical, very strong and fought Anderson Silva. It didn't make weight, didn't make weight. And, and when I tell you that he was on fucking death's door, I've never, in all my years of watching fights, uh, watching weigh ins, seeing guys look dehydrated, I'd never seen anybody look as bad as him. His lips were cracked, like you could see like he'll like cracks in his lips. His lips had shrunken down and like his, his, like he was chapped, his face was completely sunk and scary and he was shuffling.

Speaker 3:          01:20:06       He Walk to the scale, he was shuffling and he didn't make the weight and he tried for like an hour and a half afterwards to try to make the weight still. The next day took Anderson Silva down, mounted him was on top of them and I'll tell you what, if travis was 100 percent right there, he would've submitted Anderson. Like Travis was submitting. Everybody who's was just kinda blood will like Charles Mccarthy who was a friend of mine, have train with them in the house. He said it was like rolling with Ricardo Laborio. He said his level was like super high level and blues chance and really never, never sort of reached the full potential after that. But that was, that was like the worst I've ever seen is like a guy who just blew his potential.

Speaker 1:          01:20:46       I'll tell you an interesting stat. I think it was the American Journal of Sports Medicine, so they had a, a dehydration rehydration study and they had certain percentages of dehydration and what that meant to a body, and I think it was seven percent or more, your cognitive skills decline immensely. And I think it was 15 percent dehydrated in the study. It's a death imminent death organs shut down 15 percent. Start doing the numbers, Joe, of what some of these cuts that you've heard about and seen. I heard one the other day, someone on the radio talking about an athlete that they had that was one 74 days before a way in and went down I think to 1:45 and do the math on knots. Assuming all that weight cut was water. I don't know if that's actually the case, but probably in where you're talking about your time, that's almost 15 percent.

Speaker 3:          01:21:38       Conor mcgregor when he fought Chad Mendez, he looked like a dead man. I mean you could see people were commenting and online. They like Jesus Christ, look at him. Can a guide like that? A guy like that who's fighting a guy like Mendez, Kennett guy like that in 24 hours orally rehydrate properly.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       Yeah. I don't know what the question of that. I mean, I think, I think our athletes are outliers. They are the toughest individual, you know, their genetic freaks to begin with. So you know, maybe this common science doesn't quite apply to them by the exact number, but I tell you, it's something we had, we had a meeting the other day with our operation staff and our fighters come in on Monday or Tuesday and the first thing I do is weigh a men just to kind of get an idea of hey, where they're looking at, they do a body or water company that I'm aware of, but I tell you I'm going to start being aware of kind of what these numbers are coming in versus you know, what, what the ultimate way it is. And again, just trying to be, you know, not trying to be the police but trying to be an advocate and maybe sit down with some of these fighters as a hey look, look what the studies show here, you know, look what you're subjecting yourself to. Maybe you can get away with it, you know, on the outside. But on the inside these things don't go away and you're probably doing, you know, lasting damage. Have you talked to any x fighters? I've talked to a few about that. Have ongoing kidney problems are probably going to have the rest of their life. Fibroid problems where their thyroid is all messed up from these extreme weight cuts. It's definitely there if you have to have

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       a statement. Yeah, it's devastating. And well, Daniel Cormier didn't make the Olympic team because was in. Didn't compete in the Olympics because of his kidneys shutting down. Um, it's a, it's a giant, giant problem. Um, it's just, it's awful and it doesn't. Here's the thing for a guy like, although when a guy like mcgregor, what really people want to see is what they want to see. Aldo fight mcgregor, right? They don't give a fuck if they weigh in at 1:45, then rehydrate backup to whatever the hell they weighed before that. That's nonsense. What they should do is figure out where are these guys are healthy, like, where are you healthy? Then we're going to see the best fight out of these guys. The problem is the title. The title is everything, right? You want to be. Chris Weidman is the UFC middleweight champion of the world. If Chris Weidman releases his title and says, look, I can't make the UFC one 85 pound limit anymore because of this new, um, and non ivy using policy, so I'm just going to drop the title Chris Weidman and could still have huge, super fights because he's Chris Weidman and everybody knows he's a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:24:06       So if he decided to fight at two, oh, five or whatever, people are going to line up. It doesn't matter if it's for the title, he's got a name. Rhonda Rousey has a name, connor has a name, but there's a lot of guys that just don't have a name. So for those guys, it's that, that, that title is critical. The difference between Robbie lawler fighting Carlos condit just in a fight and Robbie lawler fighting crime was kind of as a champion. It's too big goddamn difference. It's a big difference. And that's unfortunate because I think that this, the, the, the situation that they're in right now where they have to hit this specific weight class, I think we should match guys up based on their size and not based on weighing in 24 hours beforehand. At a very specific way, I think it's dangerous and I also think it's irrelevant.

Speaker 3:          01:24:50       I don't think it matters. I mean, I think there's advantages that guys would have if they were a more than a certain amount over their opponent or less than a certain amount of, you know, there's a way that you could mitigate that though. There's a way that you could figure out like what, what, what is the range of these guys could weigh in, but make sure that they are within the range of dehydration within the range of body composition and then they're not fucking with the numbers any. Let's find out what you actually weigh. What, what does Johnny Hendricks actually way, when he fights, when Johnny Hendricks is at his best, that's where Johnny Hendricks, you'd be fighting. What about Tyron Woodley all those guys and figure out where everybody belongs and then compete at that level. But everybody's competing for titles. You know, and I think that is part of the problem is the 1:55 pound title, the one 70 pound title.

Speaker 3:          01:25:36       But really what we want to see as the best fighters fighting against the best fighters. That's where the money's at. Yeah, I hear you. I don't think there's, you know, a simple answer to this. I think it's, you know, it's a process and steps and then all I can say is, and I already am beating this, but I'm going to be the squeaky wheel here that, you know, hopefully at some point squeaks enough that, you know, get some grease into this. And in terms of the fighters, hey, I have just one interest at mind. My one goal in one interest and that's looking out for their health short and longterm with everything we're doing with this anti doping program with the ivy ban. I mean it, it is. Ultimately, I, I challenge anyone to say that I don't have that, you know, at the forefront of what we're trying to do here.

Speaker 3:          01:26:18       I certainly think you do, but I just think that the ivy band, without some sort of weight class management is almost like counterintuitive. I think there has to be something that allows these guys who they've got like Weidman is worked so hard to get to the 185 pound title to all of a sudden he can't make it anymore because you can't use [inaudible]. It just seems ridiculous because you have a policy that he's too dehydrated and you check them and you find out what he's doing to get to one 85. Even though he's been doing his whole career. You guys step in and say, Hey, this is too dangerous and we're not gonna allow you to do it anymore. That's, you know, it's kind of crazy. If he's gotta move up 20 pounds. He's already talked about fighting Jon Jones statement he made recently and there's one thing I love about this guy said he wants to fight the best guys in the world and he says if Weidman or if John Jones rather comes back, he goes, I have to fight this guy because he's the best and I'm not leaving the sport until I fight Jon Jones and because he's the best at two, oh five.

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       And so he wants to do that, but I just think that, I think the, making the weight cut and making that way classes probably reducing his career and probably reducing a lot of these athletes' careers. They can do it, they get through it, but at what price and that price is, I'm sure cumulative. It has to be. Yeah, I hear everything you're saying Joe. Um, you know, I don't think I say as this program has been up and running now for a month, month and a half, I'm generally don't listen to me, man. They gotta listen to you. They think I'm crazy. You gotta you gotTa talk to them. Weight classes, more weight classes and all the people who support shut up dummies. Shut up. All of you. You don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:28:01       Just fucking sport is so filled with crazy people. They're willing to do anything to win. I mean, that's one of the, one of the things about the weight cut is that the amount of effort, that titanic effort that it takes to get down to some of these weight classes and rehydrate and compete against world class athlete, world class athletes and the toughest sport in the world. Twenty four hours later. It's just nuts. They're superhuman on so many levels, so many levels. The fighting skills, their ability to withstand pain. It's just incredible. The mental toughness to the mental toughness that it takes to go through those weight cuts and then compete 24 hours later. It's just insane. So we were talking earlier about the designer drugs that you're catching people on or these drugs that they're testing that they like. We were talking about the cyclist. Is there anything else that's like that that you may see coming up? Possibly. I mean I don't have anything for you here today, but there's

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       constantly drugs in clinical trial phase that could have an application to, you know, performance enhancement and how do you guys stay on top of that stuff? Like what is, what's the method of making sure that you're aware of every new thing that these guys are doing to try to get some sort of an advantage and when these things should be legal and illegal? Yeah. What's. I mean that's, that's the role of the anti-doping authorities and you saw to who we use and they constantly interact and interface with the pharmaceutical industry so that way they know these things run the pipeline. They can get a look at, hey, what's potentially performance enhancing or not? I think the pharmaceutical companies been pretty cooperative about it. I mean financially they could probably care less but you know, it doesn't look good. I think when they have a product like an EPO, which is a great drug for someone who has cancer, Rosa anemic and helps your body create red blood cells that you need to live great drug, but then you know, most of the press about it as athletes that are using it to cheat.

Speaker 1:          01:30:04       So I think it's good for our reputation standpoint for the pharmaceutical industry to, you know, get on top of these things and seeing what the application could be in and helping anti-doping with that. Is there a window where these guys are going to be able to use certain things that you guys haven't caught onto yet that are actually legal for them at a certain point, like some natural supplements perhaps that turn out to be like a little bit too effective. Like how do you make that distinction potentially and that that really lies with water. The world antidoping agency and they are constantly monitoring things. There's certain things, I forget what it was, we were talking last week, but they have things on their watch list so that something like you just talked about could be some type of legal supplement and they're taking a look at it and studying it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       What are the performance enhancing benefits? Does it have side effects were that, you know, if you had athlete and say hey, I don't want to risk myself to those side effects, so I don't want to use that. Even if it is legal, as somebody's gaining an unfair advantage because they're willing to risk, so side effects. So it's a constant monitoring process being done by the top level anti-doping authority, which is water. Now what about unintentional contamination? Anderson Silva just got through this big crazy trial in Vegas, which I'm sure you watched those in the front row. I was right behind him. What the hell was that about? The songs that kept playing I was hearing was disturbing on so many levels. So many explain to people what I'm talking about because for some they hear it from me. They're gonna think I'm kidding. Like explain what was going on. So they had a, they had a little conference call device, which they have actually a couple of scientists on the line for that were testifying about some of his tests and somebody out there was able to get the number and in the middle of the hearing was playing these songs. Uh, so let's say he was taught, he was testifying about the Cialis that he thought was cialis that he was using. And like a shaggy came on,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       salt and pepper song came on. Yeah, it was. Songs about sex kept coming on during the. It'll be such a zoo. The whole thing was just so ridiculous. Yeah. It wasn't good. It was great for people that were paying attention. I mean, the courtroom burst out in laughter. Yeah. But it's, I mean, sad somebodies career, reputation at stake in a bright. I mean, to me that's. I'm all about having a little humor injected into things, but I hated to see that. Um, I. well, I can't say I hated it. I, it was just too funny to me. I think the whole thing was odd in the first place. Um, the, the argument is for folks who hadn't heard that, that he was taking or the excuses that he was taking liquid cialis that was apparently made in the laboratory that also made steroids and that this liquid cialis was tainted unintentionally.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       Like you get a vat of stuff and you mix it all together and then you throw the new stuff and the next VAT and you haven't cleaned it. His story was it was liquid. Cialis from a friend that he recently got to know that came from Thailand in a blue on mark vial, which is crazy, but if you're gonna make something up, but you really make that up. I would lead, lend more credibility to that story because of the personal nature of taking it and maybe the embarrassing, the embarrassment around taking that. He have come in and said, hey, I used the protein powder and found something in it. Right. I would lend some credibility to that. Well, uh, you know, I had alluded to that on this show. I didn't, didn't express the exact nature of the issue, but I'd known about this for a long time.

Speaker 2:          01:33:38       I had heard about the liquid cialis excuse for a long time, but if I'm correct, he said that he had taken that same steroid, went while he was healing from his broken leg. I'm pretty sure that he had said that he had taken it before to heal his broken leg. And then when he was surprised was that he had tested negative during camp, but then positive after the fight and that's when they decided to check out the liquid cialis. I wasn't, I wasn't aware of of that. That didn't come up in the, in the here and yeah, that's my boss route and was critical of it boss route and was saying that he's changed his story more than once. And boss was saying that, that this is what he had said, that he had taken it to heal up his leg and then you know, then it was this new excuse with the liquid cialis. And if there's a lesson I learned over the years of seeing so many of these high profile athletes kind of get brought to the table and you know, their reputations kind of tarnished forever is come to the table and just be transparent and miss exactly. Transparency. That the public is very forgiving, very forgiving. Especially in a sport like this where most people believe that a large percentage of the athletes at one point in time have done something that at least now would not be legal, including testosterone replacement,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       which was legal just a little bit more than a year ago in Nevada. Which again, going back to what I said, the, the understanding of why things happen, my personal understanding of why athletes shows to go that route. I think most of the public will be like that. Hey, there wasn't much testing going on. You know, maybe a couple weeks out the night of the fight, um, you know, you were probably stupid if you weren't doing something based on your risk and your life every time you got in there. So definitely under those circumstances. Now under the new one here, and I don't think people should be as forgiving because everybody should know now how serious this is, that it's, you know, year round that there are serious consequences and the risk is far going to outweigh the reward. Hopefully. Now, as far as inadvertent contamination, as far as accidental dosing, you, if you buy something from some protein powder or vitamin that comes from some shop, you know and you don't know, you know, it's supposed to boost testosterone naturally or something like that, and then it turns out that steroids in it.

Speaker 1:          01:35:59       How often does that happen? Is that a real issue with athletes or is it a bullshit excuse they use to cover up the fact that it took steroids are real issue, so my career I just left to come to the UFC. I was with the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigation. We investigated the dietary sports supplement and industry and there's hundreds of products out there on the shelves with steroids over the counter with steroids and other substances which would cause our athletes to test positive for and as we're getting out and going out and educating our athletes, that is a huge portion of the education. It is that you have to be more than careful, extreme careful about what you take. Ultimately you're liable for everything that goes into your body. Hey, we'll be here and will be a resource for you to help kind of Wade through those issues and those, those landmines that are out there, but ultimately you're responsible for what goes in your body.

Speaker 1:          01:36:56       Now we have built in our policy mitigating factors that can reduce sanctions so that if somebody, you know, did test positive for steroids, they were able to show because they kept a sample of it. Um, they told us what the lot number with the bottle was. Someone went and got that off the shelf to ensure that hey, they didn't just spike the sample that they had, that there was that steroid in it, that there were other circumstances about, you know, occurrences like that, something like that could, could be grounds for a reduction and sanctioned to as low as, you know, maybe a public warning for the first time maybe. Um, but nevertheless there's still going to be some type of sanction and that'll be your first one. So that the next one that came about could, you know, double potential penalties. So it's tough issue, man.

Speaker 1:          01:37:43       One that I worry about a lot because all of our fighters take supplements. We're not going to get up there and say don't take supplements. Anybody I don't think that's realistic. And they say, hey, John, contradicting. If you think about the fact that all these athletes takes off elements, right, why are they taking supplements? Why gain in performance enhancing advantage? How much of an advantage that we're talking and talking supplements you're talking, you know, derivatives of food. I'm talking drugs here, but some of these derivatives of food had been known to enhance testosterone development or production. Theoretically, no, I haven't seen tests. Some of these natural testosterone boosters. Uh, you know, personally, I think a lot of it's Hocus pocus and just marketing and sales pitches. Well, the standard ones, things like creatine, we know that has an athletic advantage. There's a performance enhancing benefit of creatine, but creatines legal, right?

Speaker 1:          01:38:37       It is. Yep. So the amount is just small enough so that it's not, it's under the wire, it doesn't, it doesn't reach this steroid, like level where you guys have to step in and say. I guess that would be the reasoning why water has not prohibited Korea, 10 that, you know, in terms of the level of what it's really going to do for you. It's, it's minor is zero and avenue that fighters have where they can send you guys stuff that they're thinking about taking. And then you could test it like say if a guy is at, you know, some vitamin store or something like that and see some human growth hormone booster, that's all amino acids and totally natural. And I'm like, ah, I don't know man, can we, can they send it to you? Uh, now we don't have anything in place where they can send it to us.

Speaker 1:          01:39:18       That would be, you know, I'm sure we get inundated with things and be spending money. We could be spending on a testing on that. But what they do do is shoot. I get 20 to 30 a week, maybe emails from athletes about, hey, here's what I'm taking. Can I take this one? Um, that one. And typically what I do is for that to United States antidoping agency you saw to where they, uh, actually have, uh, a phd, a woman who's, she is probably the nation's expert on dietary supplements and she buys you Sato will buy on their own hundred or so a year and test them theirselves. They actually have a website that lists a lot of these that have tested positive for substances that would be a positive test under our program. So yeah, we're constantly answering questions, providing resource. But ultimately I tell everybody and they're disappointed that I say I could never give you 100 percent green light to take something.

Speaker 1:          01:40:19       I can't on the other side, say 100 percent, don't touch that one. I can give you red flags. But you know, even, you know, the most reputable company that sells, you know their vitamin in Costco, you don't know about that one bottle from that one batch. I gave you the horror story of all time. And it's in the, it's in the news, you can google it and read it. But there was a a vitamin company that had a vitamin B, I don't know if it was 12, I think it was manufactured in long island a couple of years back, and the guy that was manufacturing it on the run before vitamin took, did a run of a raw product that he got from some guy in the south. Ran that through the machine with instructions of how much to put in each capsule. Sent that off to the guy in the south.

Speaker 1:          01:41:05       The vitamin companies product is next on the machine. You didn't clean the machine off well enough, and that previous product had a designer, anabolic steroids, super drawl mythos drone, which is one of the most powerful anabolic steroids. It's orally taken. That got into the [inaudible]. The [inaudible] I'm sure I'm thinking it was maybe a. I mean it was a reputable retail store or it was sold a week or two later. Elderly people started presenting themselves at hospitals in this area. What was being sold with yellow eyes, yellow palms. Because they were ingesting a vitamin that had his very toxic steroid in it and they were getting sick from liver damage. Luckily that's the extreme, but there have been cases of and we talked and then we start talking to sports supplement and industry, which is, you know, testosterone boosters, maybe more edgy stuff. You see that happen way more often.

Speaker 1:          01:42:01       I invite you after it go on. You saw it aside. It's publicly available. A supplement for one one. They have listed all of the dietary supplements that they've bought this year and tested. I was just looking at it last night. I don't know if it's over 100, but it's probably more than 50 in there, which the public can still go out and buy a there on the shelves of stores and they contain, in many instances, anabolic steroids in all instances, compounds which would cause our athletes to test positive. Wow, that's crazy. There's that many of these things. Here it is right here. There it is. Supplement four, one one. Realize, recognize and reduce. So if you scroll down, Scroll Down Syndrome list, keep going, go, go back up a little bit. High risk list there on the left high risk supplement products. Are you going to have to enter? You can put my name in there baby. Put Joe's name and there you have to put it on. Were searching. I think the idea behind, Ya know, motherfucker, the idea behind that is actually a protection of the athlete so that if you went in there, um, and you put your name in and then later said, hey, I went and searched, you know, you saw it as site. Um, there will be a record of, of you haven't searched that.

Speaker 4:          01:43:13       All right, let's see what we got here. Okay, got it. What do we got? All these different.

Speaker 1:          01:43:24       You're scrolling down, but scroll the page down for. So we get a full screen. So there you go. Zero liquid and that stuff has got dag. A product contains a list of prohibited substance label lists a prohibited substance product contains prohibitive in testing revealed presence of one Andrew [inaudible] dial. And that stuff's illegal. Now though, isn't it interesting that those prohormones he used to be able to sell those? There is. It was a new law passed. It was late last year, early this year, the designer, anabolic steroid control act or Baska and it basically made it easier to quantify some of these designer drugs as steroids and took a whole bunch of known ones that weren't on the steroid. Yes. List yet and converted them to control Sepsis, but here we're still only at the aes on product name on the list. This is a crazy list. Look, look, all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:44:18       A lot of xander's teen dial up. Wow. This is amazing. Now. It used to be just a few years ago that you could basically. I mean I guess more than a decade ago now, but you could basically buy steroids from like GNC. I mean the stuff that they had was oral steroids. Yeah. Are there still some of these out there? They've just become more designers. Just look at the fucking list of prohibited substance in this Angel Dust Shit. Oh my God. Wow. Okay. Well we'll. We'll leave it to anybody who wants to look into this. I mean, our athletes, we're constantly directing them toward that. Obviously if it's on this list, don't take it, but there's hundreds of others that aren't on that list. They only have so much time and resources to buy these. They they could probably hire another two or three phds and by these full time and triple or quadruple that list.

Speaker 1:          01:45:06       That is mad. No, the industry that's crazy. So an athlete go into a vitamin store and just buying a bunch of these things off the counter. There's a very good possibility that he's going to get an actual steroids and I'd be very concerned and that's where we pass it along to them. They shouldn't be concerned. Now the story that you told about the [inaudible] is really disturbing because I would think that if they cleaned it at all, how would it be possible? These trace amounts would get into these people's vitamins to the point where they're getting sick from liver damage when it's toxic. Steroids, they obviously didn't do a good job and you know, clean it at all. It's exactly. You know, as a, so the dietary laws in here in the United States and you know, for foods and dietary supplements, there's no premarket review of a product, so you and I and I, in fact, I think the bells you had on last week as part of bigger, faster, stronger, did a little piece on what the dietary supplement industry is.

Speaker 1:          01:45:57       And I think he hired a couple people off the street to make supplements and showed you could put them right to the shop. That's accurate. So it's up to the FDA after the fact, after something's already been on the shelf after probably somebody's already got sick or hurt, unless you have somebody in the FDA being very proactive, which I'll tell you, coming from the FDA, they're not proactive. They're reactive agency, um, that typically either a complaint has to be made or somebody gets hurt before they go out and you know, enforce what the law is. That product shouldn't be at the show on the shelf. They need to do a much, much better job. And especially in my position now where I have this group of athletes, which I feel very fatherly over a, I would call on the FDA to, do, you know, a way better job than what I saw was happening on the inside. It's a huge organization, mostly regulatory. I was

Speaker 2:          01:46:49       on the criminal side, but they have a huge population of regulatory employees that they could be doing a much better job in managing and uh, and taking these products off the shelf. It just seems almost like there's no way to keep up with. And if there's that, I mean you looked at so many different supplements right there that just were the letter a and how many of them all told that they have on their list. Jamie, you can answer that. How many, uh, if you say it, is there a number that shows how many they have now? These were all even just tested this year. She's been doing that for a period of. Oh my God, that's so crazy. Wow. Cause you know, you'd heard about that before from athletes. We've all heard, you know, that he, he took a supplement and it turned out to have a banned substance in it and inadvertently tested positive for steroids and a lot of times you think they're full of shit and that's just their excuse.

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       But Wow, I'm looking at it a different way right now because of that. It's no doubt concerning. Now what about, is it possible that one of these things like an Hvac machine or, or altitude training, or is it possible that one of those things will eventually be so effective that you guys are going to have to think about banning that as well? I don't know. I mean we're, we're following the law prohibited lists and Wada prohibited methods. So it ultimately would be if, if water decided this, it would fall under our program and actually under our program, um, you know, I think we'd have the ability to evaluate it and determine whether or not we wanted to adopt it. We likely would, I mean, what is the gold standard and you know, they're not just arbitrarily throwing things out there that that wouldn't give someone an unfair advantage to put on their prohibited lists.

Speaker 2:          01:48:34       So we'd fall along likely. Now. One of the things that I really wanted to make sure I talked to you about because it was one that really raised my eyebrows when we're talking in Brazil is gene doping and it seems like we are at this very strange point when it comes to technology and innovation that there it's. I don't think they're more than a decade away from doing something very bizarre to human bodies where it might be undetectable or might be so prevalent that it might change the rules. If you, you're aware of crispr. Do you know about the innovation that they created in 2012 called Crispr? That allows them to much more efficiently manipulate genes and they're doing it mostly, you know, they're testing it in non viable embryos in China and they're doing it in all different animals and different things. But the idea being that within a certain amount of time, it's just undoubtedly going to be something that they experiment with with people. In fact, I have a friend who knows someone that was. They were traveling to the Middle East where in this one lab they were performing these tests

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       where they were going to make it so that you could determine. I mean this is all. A lot of it is. I'm in the preliminary stages and a lot of it is, it hasn't been totally proven that it's effective, but they're gonna be able to manipulate it. I call her think I'm going to build, manipulate sex, change the hair color, they're gonna, be able to do all sorts of different things to, to the baby in the embryonic stage to change what they are as adults. And the idea of creating a super athlete through genetic manipulation is not that far away.

Speaker 1:          01:50:23       It's crazy. You know, I know anti-doping when they get together many times during the year and have their conferences and bring together leading scientists. It's almost always, you know, one or two hour block on where gene doping is going, where it is now. When was it now I don't, I don't know the technicalities of where it is now, how close athletes are doing it, but God, man, you talk about taking a risk, one thing to take a drug, but when you're manipulating your gene, who knows, you know, and shoot one or two years, what that's gonna do to you. It feels like an x men movie though. Does that? It's like Jurassic Park, you know, or getting out of control real quick. I'm mostly that happening.

Speaker 3:          01:51:04       I'm talking about Wolverine Guy Heels like that and saying, yeah, yeah, I mean Jurassic Park Wolverine. Although I mean I just feel like there people are gonna be the first to take the leap. There's going to be someone or some government or

Speaker 1:          01:51:20       somebody who's going to be. It's going to be the bodybuilding community and every drug that I've seen used in athletics, performance, anti benefits, that is the community that always tries at first. Those guys are willing to risk anything. What does it get bigger or die trying? Kind of the motto that is very common, uh, saw it firsthand. They're willing to try and be the Guinea pig for anything and they'll still get a little bit bigger, die young. I do a lot of those guys. They're usually the ones that refine how the drugs are taken to determine, hey, this, even though it's, you know, marketed or promoted for this, actually we'll do this for you as well. And saw that firsthand where non bodybuilding athletes would rely on advice from them of how to do it and what the effects were. Well, they turn over again, saw that insulin, right? Yeah. Which is super dangerous, isn't it? No doubt that make you a diabetic real quick

Speaker 3:          01:52:19       myostatin inhibitors. That's something that I have been fascinated ever since I saw a photo of those whippets that have that genetic. It just an aberration in the whippets from breeding and they've been able to manipulate cows and pigs and, and cause it to happen now. And pigs I think are the latest ones. They've been able to do it to where they have double muscle. I've seen some of those photos and sane and they've been able to do it to mice and the fucked up thing about mice as they live longer, they have doubled their lifespan I think, and they look awesome. Beach, they look like Kevin Randleman mice. I mean, what is, what's going to happen when that stuff makes its way into mma? What do you do?

Speaker 1:          01:53:01       Yeah, I mean my guessing an anti doping is is you're going to at some point get to some type of gene testing and the ability to look at human genes and see if they'd been manipulated, manipulated or inhibited.

Speaker 3:          01:53:15       But what if someone has a natural manipulation? Like there's a boy that was born. I think it's been more than one person, but I know of one that was born in Germany that has that same issue that these cows have and these whippets have. And this young boy, there he is. Jesus fucking Christ. Is that real? That's not real. Oh, come on. Is that real way to scroll up? Scroll up. Don't hold on. How genetic engineering to make us look like. Bodybuilders naturally it. Just scroll down so it can hear what she. In past posts. We'll look into this because this might be bullshit because that's Chris Bell right there posing with that cow that's from bigger, stronger, faster. Find. Find out if. Because I know there was a young boy looked different than that because I looked like a kid with an adult arm. The other one looked like a kid that had like a six pack.

Speaker 3:          01:54:01       It was. It was really bizarre. He had really thick leg muscles and and they were saying that this child was born without that gene. I mean myostatin inhibitor gene and that this is something that's. It might be him. Yeah. Myostatin muscle. Her looks real like, look at that. That doesn't look real. That kid is fucking shredded. Look, get a six pack. That's nonsense. He looks like he's got a turtle shell grown out of his stomach. Jesus Christ. That kid is going to be a stud. So what do you do with a kid like that? If a kid like that, once it compete in the UFC, do you say, no, you're a mutant. You have to compete in the x games.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       Yeah. I don't know. I always liked seeing that, that genetic freak of nature that comes along. Everyone Herschel Walker or even like a babe ruth who was, had a boiler on him that was obviously strong as hell. So maybe one of these. He's one of those, those cool people that come along once every generation and everybody can get behind because I know in there knowing that that's real.

Speaker 3:          01:54:56       I Dunno. Well it's real, but it's also a genetic freak accident. I mean, he is definitely a real kid. I mean he didn't, he wasn't born as far as we know it wasn't created in a lab, but he has some sort of a freak advantage.

Speaker 1:          01:55:11       Like it wasn't. I mean Lebron James is a genetic freak accident. Izzy. I mean, one could argue that. Yeah, no, you absolutely can and you would be right, but he's not competing and fighting. I see that that is a little bit more extreme there. Uh, I don't know how you deal with that. I mean obviously he's going to be able to show through medical records that it's been that way. And all through his life and didn't just suddenly appear when he was 16 and did manipulate his jeans. So I mean I guess you can show that was his natural. I don't know. I don't know what the answer to that is. It seems like a for your job, it seems like there's like a window of time for you to enact change before all this crazy genetic shit starts rolling in from China and Russia and who knows where.

Speaker 1:          01:55:53       Not accusing China and Russia, but they have been known to do some funky things in the past. Yeah. You know, I worked at my last job, I worked at the Air Mail facility at San Francisco International Airport and part of that job was to monitor everything coming in from China and the stuff that came through there. And my primary focus was on drugs and raw product and compounds that we're putting into dietary supplements here. But the majority of bad stuff going into these supplements come in here. That's where it's coming from. From China. It is, Yep. They don't have a lot of rules over there. They don't. And that's why it's also scary than manufacturing standards over there aren't good so that they'll send something over to a US manufacturer here saying, Hey, here's what's in this product or this raw compound, and the US manufacturers take that at its word and really not know what's going into his product.

Speaker 1:          01:56:47       And that's why often you see supplements that don't have on the label. What's what's really in that and it's not cost effective for them to test every batch and every lot that comes in. So you see a lot of that as well. Well, I learned from the Sopranos that most of the shipping containers are coming to the United States don't get tested and true volume that comes in, it would be in pot, you'd have to hire a million or 2 million people to inspect everything. So they target things. I mean the intelligently target, you know, depending on what area is it comes from and what, you know, what is declared at. But no, there's the percentage of things that actually do get looked at and tested is, is pretty low. It's just kind of disturbing. It's just, it's amazing to consider that there's so many shipping containers that are coming in from somewhere like China, China on a daily basis and who knows what could be possibly in them.

Speaker 1:          01:57:39       Scary now as far as like what is prohibited in band right now, how many different things are prohibited in band? We could actually pull up. Water's got they're prohibited list available and that's one of the cool things about our policy is how transparent it is. Everything that we're doing, our rules, UFC rules are fighters can go look at their support personnel, can look at the public and go look at. They can look at the water prohibited lists, the water prohibited method. It's out there for everyone to see. Another thing that you know, a lot of people are surprised at this, but actually when we as our testing, we're testing now, but it goes forward and starts really in earnest. You cited will start posting who's tested and how many times they're tested by athlete name, by the end of this year of public and pull up the USADA UFC websites who ufc fighter a was tested eight times UFC fighter.

Speaker 1:          01:58:38       Be They were tested three times total transparency and that's done. Again, to go back to what we talked about earlier, trust and credibility of the system. It's, it's paramount. It's huge for us. For you to be able to say, we're not hiding anything here. It's all out in the open what we're doing. So that athlete, you know, if you don't really think you know what's going on or I think this has got here, it's all out there in the open for you. Take a look exactly what we're doing is. One of the things that people found disturbing about the Anderson Silva allegations was that it was revealed that he would never been tested outside of competition except this one time where we tested negative for most of our athletes fall under that same circumstance. Um, Nevada California started doing it too. It was probably the best, I think maybe New Jersey where they would do what we call enhanced testing where they would maybe take the top two or three fights on a card and go out for maybe six weeks.

Speaker 1:          01:59:35       That was the extent of any out of competition tests, you know, as we educate, we're going out to different gyms, we're educating the fight cards, uh, on the Wednesday before Saturday fight. We usually ask the question, hey, who's been tested other than, you know, a day of competition test. Very few hands go up, you know, maybe a couple per session. So yeah, I mean, in terms of, again, understanding why an athlete will do something, Hey, when you're not testing anybody, unless it's on the day of the fight, which is really just an Iq test as long as you're smart enough to know how fast a drug a clear your system, you could easily use drugs in the past and get off, um, you know, a week or two ahead of time, have them clear system and maintain the benefits of those drugs, most of them through the fight. So is it, is it any surprise, uh, y, you know, especially when you're risking your health and in some arguments your life when you're getting in that octagon, is it any surprise why a lot of athletes have made that under really?

Speaker 1:          02:00:37       No testing in the past, it's not to me, but a guy like Anderson Silva who's widely considered to be, if not the greatest of all time, one of the top two or three grants of all time. The fact that he was only tested once out of competition and failed. That's a, that's really disturbing to a lot of people. They go, well, you know, you're looking at these spectacular performances that he was able to have. Who knows what he was under or on when he pulled those off. Yeah, I mean, and not just, you know, taints the legacy. Looking at him individually. But yeah, you extrapolate that out with, you know, everybody in the sport that likely, you know, if he wasn't tested out of competition, how about the other 549 behind him if he's at the top of the game. So you extrapolate that out. It's scary.

Speaker 1:          02:01:21       Um, so a, we'll see. We'll see real quick here. I'm in. I think a lot of it though early on is, and then thank you for this platform today, but just getting the message out, being that deterrent effect upfront. You know, having those athletes and support look now saying, okay, the game's changed now. It's no longer, you're not going to be tested. You don't trust that your opponents. Now the game's changed that they're using every method and tool available. They're using blood, urine testing for specific drugs. They're looking at a biological passport. So if a specific drug doesn't show up, they could catch somebody that way. Hell, they're freezing our blood and urine that if the test isn't available today and maybe in a year or two and they'll go back and test that and then maybe if I'm not fighting, my legacy is, is done. Hopefully everybody's hearing all these things that we're doing a hearing me talk about experiences I've had with athletes in the past about how damn stressful it's going to be for a UFC athlete right now to use drugs and get away with it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       They are going to be thinking about that 24 slash seven. I guarantee you a shit who's coming tomorrow. Okay, how long do I got for this clears my system? Can I trust the person that's telling me that all this shit's going to be happening from now out in the hope would be being that determine up front, so the decisions made on the front end. Okay. It wasn't something that we can do now as opposed to all of a sudden dozens of positive tests on the back end. The hope is I can get out and do a good enough job of expressing how serious is going to be that that our population of fighter here that

Speaker 3:          02:02:52       now. What about the difference between in competition and the competition testing and as far as like what the penalties are for added competition testing and what about recreational drugs in competition? Not a competition. Testing like John Jones tested positive for cocaine and it was out of competition so he was still allowed to compete in. A lot of people were kind of critical of that and like how is that possible that you tested guy? He tests positive for a banned substance and yet he still allowed to compete. You don't even hear about it, but the results were known before he fought and they never went public.

Speaker 1:          02:03:27       Yeah, I mean a lot of different issues there. So let me one at a time. So first our UFC policy, so out of competition, the test for out of competition drugs, those drugs are, those substances will be your hard substances, your anabolic steroids, your human growth hormones, your blood doping type drugs, those are tested for both out and in. And those are tested 365 days a year in competition. And the definition of in competition under our policy is six hours before the weigh, in to six hours after the fight. During that period of time, the drugs tested will be your drugs, recreational drugs, marijuana stimulants, including cocaine, other drugs. So there's only really a, you know, a 48 hour so window that those will be tested for those recreational drugs are not tested for at a competition. And the John Jones situation that was in Nevada State Athletic Commission test, uh, they have the same rules at the time.

Speaker 1:          02:04:23       Drugs of abuse were to be tested for only in competition. My understand drugs of abuse, you mean recreational drugs? Racial drugs. Sorry. Yeah. Some. My understanding is somebody made a mistake and check the box to do recreational drugs and an attic competition collection. Oh, so he wasn't supposed to be tested for cocaine? Correct. Dave, you know, their policy was not to test for cocaine, marijuana, they're stimulants out of competition. It was a mistake of checking a box. So when it turns out positive, he's not punished for it because they weren't supposed to test for it in the first place. That's my understanding. Yep. Okay. Um, you know, it's unfortunate. I don't like when any mistakes are made like that. I think, you know, even though it was Nevada state athletic commission, it taints the entire anti-doping, you know, arena. I think anti-doping needs to be almost perfect because again, going back to that trust and credibility factor, regardless of who's doing it, when they make mistakes and anti-doping like a false positive.

Speaker 1:          02:05:25       I mean, to me, a false positive could never happened because no one would ever trust anything that's going on for a, you know, mistakes like that, collection errors where the collectors aren't going observing. If you have holes in the system and it gets out, does it matter who's doing it? I think it taints all of anti-doping and so that's one of the reasons we went to Usada is these guys have been in the business longer than anybody else. They're known as kind of the gold standard entity and all the world they are in that business. They've been doing it for 15 years. They know what all the pitfalls are and they expect themselves to be perfect and I think that's huge to lend that credibility and trust to our athletes. Nevada recently changed its levels of acceptable use of marijuana. They changed the levels of acceptable and metabolites in the system.

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       What is it at now and what you were discussing with me in Brazil, you were saying that you essentially would have to fight high in order to test positive. Yeah, likely. So Nevada adopted in terms of marijuana with the water standard was, and that's 150 nanograms per milliliter a, it probably doesn't mean much to most people. But to give you some perspective, it used to be 15 nanograms per milliliter. So they've increased it 10 times, 10 times. Exactly. Um, so you'd have to be under the influence while you're fighting. It's tough because that's, as we're out educating, the next question we get is, hey, how long would I, if I was a chronic smoker, how long would it have to be off it? It's tough to say each individual varies in terms of how they metabolize the fat content on your body may store it longer. So we can't give our athletes guidance like, hey, if you do it a week out or two days out, you're fine. I'm the only thing we can give them is just kind of what statistics have borne out. Um, you sought as tested all their Olympic athletes. Thousands now under this standard of 150 milligrams per milliliter over the last couple of years. They've had very few positive tests. Maybe, you know, a couple. Then along comes Nick Diaz

Speaker 2:          02:07:37       was under 150 nanogram per milliliter. Stays at that point he was under, but he's still tested positive. He was over. That was over when, I mean Andrea, he fell under. Oh, that standard. So what was, what was his test results? I don't know specifically what it was. Other than that, it would have been over 150. So he essentially fought high. Probably respect. Imagine that you're not just fighting Anderson Silva. You fighting them while you're stoned. Damn. Nick Diaz is a beast. I mean, I don't advise it, but I respect it kinda crazy though, right? That he could a fight in the UFC in the main event like that. Yeah. I don't know. I was uh, I was a basketball player in college basketball player and uh, you know, when I played, I had guys on my team that will get stone before practice. I'm dominate practice. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:30       People love it. A Jujitsu to Jujitsu. It's a huge part of the Jujitsu world. So many guys like you go to a lot of Jujitsu schools and you'll see the parking lot before, but he goes into train. Guys are smoking pot. It's very, very common because they feel like it puts them in a zone. My own personal experience I feel like it does puts me in a, in a zone. It makes me understand the techniques better because you look more of a sensitivity to training. Well, how about in the MMA world because you're worried about so many different things. A strike a take that you got so many things to worry about. I mean, do you find that you're focusing in on this one thing and you're not paying attention to? No, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you're not ready. This is. Yeah. What

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       I find, I find that it's not that good for learning things. I find that when you're learning something, especially like if you're drilling something, I find drilling is better done sober. Like I'm better off at learning things sober, but once something is committed to my nervous system, once I understand how to do the move, like there's certain positions, there are certain positions that did just fall into the way a Eddie Bravo is, describes it best. I love this analogy. It's like, you know when you tie your shoes, you don't even think about it. You just wish you just tie your shoes because you've tied your shoes every day for your whole life and it just becomes natural. There are certain positions where you find yourself sinking into submission. You don't even know what's happening until you've done it because you've done it so many times in drills that it just becomes automatic.

Speaker 3:          02:09:52       Those are enhanced by marijuana, but the learning part, I feel like sometimes you don't get all the finer details, but maybe that's me. Yeah. I think there's also the possibility that everybody has their own different way of experiencing marijuana. The biodiversity aspect of human beings. It's. Some people just don't like it at all. I have friends that just can't do it. They'll smoke a little pot and like, fuck. They just hate, it freaks them out, they don't like doing anything on it. And then other people, they like doing everything on it. So I don't know. I don't know what other folks feel, but for me I feel like I learn things better when I'm not high, but I feel like once I'm, once I understand

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       something, it just become, it's like a second nature thing, then I feel like I'm more tuned in if that makes any sense. That's interesting because there's the argument out there from a lot like why is that even band? That's not. How is marijuana performance enhancing? So it's interesting to hear you say that. I think it can be a performance enhancing drug. I really do. Oh, how bout, how bout deadening pits obviously used for pain relief. So what do you think about it? Could mask pain? Certainly could. It's certainly possible. It's definitely not even, it's not baseline. You're not, you're not sober. So the, the idea that anything that you could use that could possibly give you an advantage, I just know it gives you an advantage. Uses Jujitsu. I know it does. I know so many guys use it, so many guys roll with it like big name guys that that are high level Jujitsu competitors.

Speaker 2:          02:11:22       They train high every time and they love it and I just think you can't ignore that. I think that it's quite possible that there's an advantage to using it and then the pain relief aspect of it. Look, you can't fight on pain pills or and if you, if there was a pain blocker that allowed you to not feel impacts of strikes and he just went out there and fought and dealt with the consequences tomorrow when it wore off, that would be illegal for sure. Well, marijuana is absolutely used to help people with pain management. Absolutely. So I don't think it should be legal to compete with. I just think I. I think there's too many possibilities. I also don't think a lot of testing has been done on the performance enhancing aspects of marijuana, but what has been revealed recently is the benefits that ultra marathon runners experience with and marijuana that they can push through better put their mind in a different place and not.

Speaker 2:          02:12:14       Yeah. I took this on the hours and hours of monotony and I don't think you can ignore that. I think, uh, I think that's certainly something that should be considered and if you're going to ban a lot of different things, obviously I liked marijuana. I'm an enthusiastic, but I think that there's, there's absolutely potential that it could be a performance enhancing drug and a lot of ways I was people mocked me on that for a long time, but now that this, these new studies are coming out, especially with a ultra marathon runners, I feel vindicated. I feel vindicated for you. Thank you. Um, is there anything else we should cover? We pretty much nailed almost everything, the comprehensive aspect of the drug testing policy. The randomness, uh, I believe the top athletes are going to be tested five times a year randomly. So it's going. I, that's, I think if you look the average with our population versus how many tests that were contracted to do or that you saw this contractor to do with us, um, it'll average to that.

Speaker 2:          02:13:10       But you know, again, everybody will be able to go on and see starting soon here, who's tested by name, how many times, and you're not going to see across the board, five for everybody. Likely you're going to see 10 or a dozen per year for some people. Really. Maybe two or three. And is there a. sorry, it's not random testing. It's intelligent testing. You saw it as not going to say hey, we're going to roll the dice and whoever comes up, they're going to look at everything from tips they may get. How they'll even look at physical appearances of athletes. You know, does this athlete pass kind of the physical appearance, smell tests? And if they don't, hey maybe we need to test that person a little bit more. Physical appearance, smell, test. Really. So like, like what would you like? You look at a guy and you go, man, that guy just looks juiced.

Speaker 2:          02:13:57       He looks different. One, you've seen it. Yeah, but I don't know man. I mean, I've seen it on guys that have tested negative and I've seen guys that have been accused of things, but they've tested negative every time. I agree. I agree with Dos Anjos, heartfelt dos Anjos was a UFC lightweight champion when he beat Pettis and he beat Pettis in such a convincing way. Boy, there were so many people accusing that guy and being on performance enhancing drugs. But if you look at his body over the years really hasn't varied that much, a little bit from the first time he was in the UFC, but that was before he was on comprehensive strength and conditioning program. You look at him like over the last few years, he's pretty consistent, but yet once he wins the title, everybody starts pointing fingers at them. And if you look at him like pull up a picture of a Hoffeld dos Anjos UFC lightweight champion of the world, uh, when he is fighting and when he's in shape and he's fit.

Speaker 2:          02:14:47       Yeah. He looks like, like I would like to look like if you were on steroids, I would say that people would take steroids if they could look like this guy. Does he pass the smell test? Like see, see if you could find a picture of him where he's just looked jacked. So there's a picture of him over in the far left up there. That's him after he beat Pettis. But look there, there's like, no, that looks just like an athlete, but that looks okay. That's a perfect one. That's him. When he was fighting pedes I believe. Is that from the same fight? Okay. Look at that. He's fucking shredded. His six pack has a six pack. I mean, but not much different physically other than like a little bit less body fat. I mean he's a fucking Stud, you know? I mean that's why he's the champ.

Speaker 2:          02:15:39       Obviously there's a lot of hard work that goes into that, but when people look at him, you know, you say, well, that looks like a guy who, if, if someone didn't look like that and then they took something and look like that, you would say, well then the guys on steroids. But if he always looks like that, it's hard. It's hard to. I different. There's outliers, uh, you know, over those, that 15 year law enforcement career I had involved with all of these cases. I mean, I knew of many athletes who look like they did, who didn't release no evidence appeared of it. Many who didn't look like they did, did. Uh, this is strictly, you know, another tool to be used. It doesn't mean all the time that, you know, an athlete that doesn't pass the smell test will test positive. But a lot of the times it does, is, it, means, is a test doesn't

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       mean that person's all your positive because you look like you did. It's like, hey, you may be an extra test or two. And if I was at athlete, that was that freak, I'd say, Hey, yeah man touched me more because people were accusing me of it. So that'll be cool. At the end of the year, everybody will look at my stats on the webpage and see I was tested 10 times and no positive test for me here. So I'm hoping a lot of this is, it's going to be, you know, in terms of the whereabouts program, the amount of tests are athletes getting, it's going to be an inconvenience. But I'm hoping that there's a lot of acceptance and embracement of it that like hell yeah, not only is this the baddest sport in the world were the toughest dude, but we have the toughest anti-doping program and bring it on.

Speaker 1:          02:17:13       I'm hoping that there's a lot of that in the sentiment that I get is as we go out and talk is a lot of that. Um, maybe it's lip service, I don't know. But, um, I would like to think that, you know, little certainly become that. If it's not that right now, it will certainly become that. Is there any potential for manipulation by opponents calling into hotlines, accusing someone of something and having them task, giving false information, false tips. Sure. There always is. I can see her doing that. I dealt with that all the time. And in law enforcement, right? First Time, first thing a tip comes in, you have to evaluate who is this person? Are they an x wide for an ex husband? Okay. Hey, are they being sued by this? You know, evaluate that and you it do that too. Um, so does someone have to say who they are when they give a tip or can they leave anonymous today?

Speaker 1:          02:17:59       Can leave it anonymously. Funnels conor Mcgregor. I'd be calling that although hotline old day. I bet he just to fuck with them. You know, it's got to be guys that are going to do that. Right? The brogue might give it away. I don't know. Yeah, right. Uh, is full. Can shape but a guy like like say dose on Joe's, you know, like who has that appearance just looks absolutely shredded and is beating everybody is automatically going to be people that point fingers at a guy like that. Right? Potentially. Sure. Is there any other type of testing that they're working on on, on the pipeline that may perhaps be even more effective than what they're doing now? Oh sure. Yeah, sure. I mean, again, I'm not the scientist. I don't get too far in the weeds when the scientists and these conferences break off the middle, a little group or if ever I have a lot of it goes over my head.

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       I don't understand what they're talking about, but I mean there's really, really smart people that their profession and life is dedicated to this arena of anti-doping. Figuring out what's out there, figuring out if there's not a test for something, how to do it and develop it or some super intelligent people on that mission out there. So I'd be concerned if I was using anything that at some point someone's not going to come up with a test for it or tech. What it was, I would, you know, again, part of the stress that's going to be out there from someone who's still under this program chooses to do something that's going to be stressful. Yeah. I mean, this is really the gold standard program now, isn't it? I mean, in professional sports. Okay. So there's no other professional sport that has number one, a truly independent authority administering it.

Speaker 1:          02:19:38       And what that does is it shows you there's not going to be any business interest, um, in, you know, carrying out the program you saw doesn't give a shit if it's our number one earner, if they test positive, does that benefit them? They don't care. All they care about is clean sport. They don't care. There's gonna be no allegations of favoritism. You sought. It doesn't care who the athlete is, where, where they live, they're all about clean sport. Again, 365 day a year or two. Well, first off, no other professional sports have that independent nature. Olympic sports had that. They have independent agencies, but professional sports don't. That's huge. To begin with, 365 days a year. Testing. I mean, you look at the other professional sports here, at least in the United States, they can't say that I'm urine and blood tests, um, at any point blood by the way, we, a lot of concerns from athletes like, man, how much blood he taken from me, that's going to be a deterrent or that could affect my performance.

Speaker 1:          02:20:36       If you take blood from me, it's less than a tablespoon of blood really. So very little amount science shows will have no effect whatsoever on your performance even later that day. Um, you know, the biological passports huge. So even if you don't find a specific drug, you know, we can go over time and look at abnormal variances. Um, and so you throw all those things together and you know, in my experience, both dealing with sports here in the US and worldwide, there's no other organization that touches with this thing is now there's some sports that you could argue really, they just can't exist without performance enhancing drugs. Bodybuilding, of course, comes to the frontline. That's the first one that everybody thinks about. If bodybuilding instituted something like this to sport would change radically overnight. I mean you would see people shrink to the point where they didn't.

Speaker 1:          02:21:27       They bear no resemblance to Dorian Yates or green or any of these guys that were in their prime that were just these freaks that look, they didn't even look like real people. Yeah. Not agree with that. But what about pro football? Like those guys are fucking gigantic. How much of that is strength and conditioning programs? I mean, do you know how much of that is that they didn't have those strength and conditioning programs in the sixties and how much of it is steroids and growth hormone and. Yeah, it's, it's hard to say. I mean they, they do have, they have, and I know and I've worked with, they're people who are instituting their program. Their program is not administered at a, is not independently administered. It's them. It's in house, in house. So say if they have a star athlete, the test positive, they can kind of.

Speaker 1:          02:22:12       You don't know that. I don't think that's happening because you looked at, you looked at some of the athletes that have. And, uh, you know, I don't think that's happening, but you know, that question would always pose itself because that is the Fox guarding the hen house. They're not nearly as comprehensive. It's not. And you know, one thing that I've found in anti-doping programs, you could have the most solid program all the way around. If you have one little weakness in it. The tiniest weakness could be a loophole that you can drive a tractor trailer through. I'll give you a perfect example. Say a program has everything that we have a 365 day year testing. Say it's even, you know, you sought administering it and say in the collection process, during the season, the collector would call up somebody on the team or in the organization the night before and say, hey, I need a parking pass tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          02:23:06       Um, to get in, I'm going to be showing up that one little phone call. Despite all the strength, comprehensive strength could be, could be the weakness that would cause everybody to run through that employee is friends with somebody you know, the players on the team knows who's hot or not makes a call the night before. Hey Man, they're coming tomorrow. Don't show up tomorrow to the professional sports leagues. I don't think they do have a three strikes. Whereabouts, policy where if they're not there for a certain day, then that can be used against them. Or if they're not there for that day as a test said, oh, I'll just get that person later. Um, so little things like that can be manipulated to, to again, drive a truck for. What did you think about the vandelay Silva situation for people not aware of it? Vandelay Silva, they showed up for random drug test out of competition.

Speaker 1:          02:23:57       Um, he wasn't scheduled for a fight and just bolted. And when he bolted, they gave him a lifetime suspension. They said you're done. Your career is over you. You avoided a drug test. Um, what, what did you think about that? So first under our program, well we had this whereabouts where you get basically three strikes in a rolling 12 months and then there's a sanction that's if you know they just can't locate you or you didn't do a good enough job or using complete your whereabouts. If a tester comes to test, one of our athletes say out of Jim says, Hey, I'm here from Usada to test you and that athlete says, screw you and runs out the back door as a sanction right there, a penalty and potentially under our system with aggravating circumstances could be four years. That may be an aggravating circumstance where this guy or girl said, screw you, I'm not doing this thing and runs out the back door.

Speaker 1:          02:24:50       So that's four years on the first time his case that he had had one before and he had a positive before. That was the first one. It was this first one. Uh, well he, he obviously didn't test positive even then because he didn't test it all. But then he admitted that he was, in his words, he was taking some sort of a. It wasn't a steroid, I think it was a diuretic, it was saying because he had fluid build up something. It didn't make any sense to me. Um, but like Aldo, he avoided taking a drug test in Brazil. Correct. Uh, I mean, I don't know if that's the, that he avoided it. I mean, there was obviously, I think Nevada play, you know, publicly disclosed what was played out. They sent a collector here from the United States down there and showed up at the gym.

Speaker 1:          02:25:37       They disputed whether or not. Yeah. Who knows what happened. One thing, you know, I don't know exactly how everything went down there. One thing I can say is under our program, and that's one of the reasons we went to Usada. Usada needs to go to another country to do a collection like that. They reach out to the national authority of that country so that when somebody shows up on behalf of you saw or with Usada out of gym, you're not going to get an instance or you know, reasoning that, hey, we didn't know who this person was. There'll be credentialed. Every bone will know who they are. There'll be a representative from that, that nation there. I think they tested, although sample anyway, if I'm correct. And he tested negative, is that true? They did. Ultimately, I think it was the next day that he provided a sample, um, and that did test negative, but there was some issues about the day before or sample wasn't provided, um, because because it went 24 hours and he could have whatever he had could have cleaned out of a system that is, you know, that would be a concern.

Speaker 1:          02:26:38       Sure. What, uh, so they can test for human growth hormone now too, which was something that they couldn't ask for for a long time. They couldn't true. And there's also another test that came out for it, um, where they can run back a couple of weeks. It used to be with a blood test, she would have had to detect it within maybe 24 hours of its use. Um, there is now an isoform test, which isn't necessarily for the drug itself, but kind of like with the biological passport. If you take growth hormone, it will affect certain markers in you that will last over time, even if the drug is cleared your system, so it gives anti-doping that ability to reach back a couple of weeks and determine if it was used. So again, an evolving tool that you know, maybe some organization says, Oh, news tests two weeks, we can call back all those frozen sample that's go back and retest them and see that maybe it wasn't within 24 hours an athlete use but two weeks.

Speaker 1:          02:27:35       So that factor I think is always hanging out there for somebody who chooses to do, to use the substances band. Well Jeff, thank you very much for coming on here and then taking the time to explain all this stuff and thank you very much for this incredibly comprehensive effort to clean up the sport. I think it's awesome and I think what you're doing is just. It's very, it's very, it's very intriguing. It's inspiring and I think ultimately it's great for the sport. Appreciate it. Yeah. He wants to say no, I think I'm good, man. Thanks for having me on. Thanks for the platform. And Yeah, look forward to seeing you at a, an event soon. Absolutely. My pleasure, Jeff Novitsky. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back tomorrow with Jeff Ross and, uh, that's it. Enjoy your day. Thank you everybody. Bye. Bye. Two hours. Thirty five minutes.
