Speaker 1:          02:46          This girl, man, I was just a wished we had more time and she could tell me more crazy, more lucrative stories. How lucrative do you get? What's that? Um, stripper.

Speaker 1:          04:02          I uh, I retweeted Ian Edwards. Uh, his, uh, you know, he's a appear this weekend at the punchline. By the way, if you're in Sacramento, he's one of the funniest fucking dudes is working today. Fucking funny. Look good. He wrote me after I tweeted it to him. Oh thanks man. It's going to be lucrative. We're both laughing about it on the plane. We couldn't stop saying it. How lucrative do you get, cause I kept pretty low grid. I do. You mean lucrative?

Speaker 2:          04:35          It's really good to surround yourself with people who inspire you because they, they talk about having a cognitive model for behavior change. Like if you're trying to get better in some way, uh, if you can visual, if you know somebody who's already done it or doing positive things in their lives, it's, it requires less energy for your brain to imagine yourself doing it. Like if you're, if you, if you don't, if you're not trying to be anybody who's trying to get healthy or trying to get fit or whatever it is, you're, it's like, it's literally harder to imagine. And so it's like more exhausting for you to try to imagine yourself getting better. Whereas if you're surrounded by people who are doing it, it becomes familiar to your brain. There's all sorts of examples that your brain can call on. Um, it literally takes less energy for you to imagine yourself actually doing it.

Speaker 2:          05:18          And weirdly, they found at Stanford University using, uh, like avatars. If you can see an Avatar that is designed to look like you, like doing the sort of things you want to do, like you know, being really physically fit, like working out in the game world. If you just watch an avatar custom design to look like you doing that, it lowers the cognitive threshold for you to do it. And then you will do more in real life. You'll like, you know, you will work out more or you'll spend more time committed to those goals just by having watched this sort of mirror version of yourself having done it.

Speaker 1:          05:52          But he's that guy now that really is who he is. He's like all the time, four hours. You call

Speaker 3:          05:58          him up in the middle of the night. He's dice man. Yeah. He became that guy. Yeah. We uh, I opened up for him for like two, three years. He really, yeah, he picked me out of the comedy story. He came up to me and uh, at first he goes, um, you know what you should do. I said, what? When you go on stage, put a sack pants and then you'll be like the comedian who's just got a big cock and this is like, this is like my guy I looked up to and he's telling me. And then I actually went home that night, gone. Should I do, should I be cat gay? So, uh, anyway, we was just kind of beard, little friendship. And he asked me if I wanted to go to Las Vegas with him at the Stardust hotel and I'm like, call my parents. I go, I'm opening up for dice clay at the stone us.

Speaker 3:          06:57          My mom was like, you made it, you made it. Wow. So they all came out to see and I hung out with them on the road. And uh, the first time we played Vegas, I'm like, I can't believe I'm here. Wayne Newton theater.

We're going to furniture shopping today. I go, Huh. And Las Vegas. So we went furniture shopping because he had a house out there and he was furnishing his house. So we would go to furniture stores and he would told me, sit on the couch. That's it. When you think, say grand guy, it's better than anything. I got it at my house. It's fantastic. And we would go to eat.

Speaker 3:          07:47          I mean this was a process. We were laying on carpets. I just see if the carpet was comfortable and uh, I'm like, uh, okay. I guess this is what you, you do.
