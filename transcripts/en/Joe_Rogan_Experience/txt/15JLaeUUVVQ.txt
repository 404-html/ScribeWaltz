Speaker 1:          00:00:01       The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight, and if you go to Joe Rogan.net, click on the link for the flashlight. You will get 15 percent off the number one sex toy for men. Oh yeah. Is that me? That's me in the background and my own computer. The fuck is wrong with me after all these months of doing this. Still can't get it right. I shut the phone off though. I fucking swear to God. I did. Bert crashes in the House bitches experience the machine crisis spreading like herpes all across America. Dude, you're spreading.

Speaker 2:          00:00:40       You're a pilot and you're affected and you're taking me everywhere with him.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       No, no, no. It's impossible to make someone famous if they're not talented. You are extremely talented and hilarious and that's why you're becoming huge. But I'm fucking hearing you everywhere. I got a clip that opie and anthony sent me. Were they a thing?

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       But think about where that started from. It started for me, the one that had the couch here. We're telling you how to crazy. Drove out. Oop. And I was telling you, they're great guys and you're like, I'm scared of doing their show. I had this crazy dream when you go on Opiod, Anthony, and you can see opiod, like looking at his computer and he's like, sweet, you dream about me.

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       Tell me about your dreams. And I was like, God, God.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       But it was literally in this show is. So I was telling Brian, I sang it the, at the braves game yesterday, uh, did the seventh inning stretch. And I sit up on the dugout. Nice thing last year, right after the first season of birth. Concrete. And no one saying the national, no, no, no, no, no, the stretch take me out to the ballgame. So I get up on the thing black blasts you. When I did at my kids were there and my wife was their whole families there. And I got up and everyone just looked at me like, who the fuck's this guy? Last night, yesterday when I did it, the whole side knew who I was. And I'm telling you, so many people were yelling the machine. So fucking bizarre. Right? You're talking about every show. I do every show, I do. Not only do people give me joints and go, this is a present for the machine. Some chick gave me three. Vicodin was like, I thought the machine would like these. I was like, are you kidding me? Last night the most buckled down, uh, people in the front row is a guy and a girl just really like Range Rover buckhead type of people, you know. And she says, um, I said something and she goes, someone yells, let machine. And I said, I'll tell that story. And she said, powerful Bert Kreischer

Speaker 3:          00:02:35       talk to you on the phone. I just talked to him

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       and you had just said something like, you fucking kidding me. Like, it's bizarre because you cannot put a finger on who is, who is a fan of the podcast, you know, like it just doesn't make sense. Who is or who is it that has some old lady the airport telling me she loves it. So many people listen to this guy who traveled to handle any. My boss is like, I just want to catch you before you hop on the Rogan podcast. I'm like, Holy Shit. I was like, how many of you listened to. It's insane. I was telling you, and I will always say this, the last thing I'll say about this podcast before we talked about regular shit is I had to call you from New York when I was coming home from letterman because when I sat down in a letterman dressing room, all the stories, they were like, can you tell this time?

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       Remember the story you told them? Rogan's podcast can tell that. Okay, there are six stories I read before we about to go on letterman that are all pulled from literally pulled from this podcast and I went, Holy Shit. And I literally, I called my wife that morning and it was a surreal moment after you do Letterman, I'm driving to the airport and I'm telling her, I go, it's all fucking Rogan. Like it's, you know, that podcast is just such. It's such a different thing than is out in media. And she was like, you need to call him right fucking now. Like I'm not calling joe to tell him thank you. She goes, don't get that. Is your that is your ego talking. You just fucking call him and thank him, and I was like, fuck it. I was hungover,

Speaker 4:          00:03:56       done check. Talk to him like that. You got to do podcasts and started to institute the rape joke and a hard fuck session just to get that out of her system. Her let her know what the fuck did you just tell me to do? Oh, it's my ego, my ego. Just take that. You're going to inoculate her with some sperm. Clear her of all that nonsense, telling you what to do. Dude, that was the nicest thing ever. You know you. You're such a thoughtful guy and you're such a friendly guy and a happy guy and that's why all these good things are happening to you, man. But there's very few people would have called and left such a nice little email like that. It was very heartwarming, man. You're a cool motherfucker was like I said, there's no way it wouldn't have helped you if you weren't already hilarious. It's just we, you know, people found out about you, but it's you. It's not us. Excellent. It's been been trying to work that tell a story. Machine age, ages so hard. It's not, it's not like, dude, that's your. Get her done. Don't even have to tell the story, man. You're the fucking machine, you know, just inform them that you're the machine now. Just let them know and then that's your. Get her done because I'm the machine.

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       Oh, Jean shirts yet? No, no. Uh, those, those guys that are making that documentary or making machine shirts. Uh, I am the machine washing. Yeah. You heard about this documentary, they're trying to follow him around for a month and raising money or I send you a tweet and what is the, what is it would explain it. So there's A. Oh shit. I should've had it fucking. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:05:32       Let me find the tweet. Go to kickstarter.com. Ask Bert. Oh, I bet. I'm sure I did send it to you that. Hold on a second. It's on kickstarter.com and see twitter's deal. But deletes your messages. If you leave them on there too long, you don't. They don't keep them meat, which means someone's probably reading your shit. So the oldest one I got from you is, it's something about you, uh, doing that, a thing that you had to do in Florida? Yeah. Yeah. Well, not anymore. The uh, so, so the

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       first time we did this, the first time I did this podcast with this guy, these two editors in this place called big boss isn't here the production company. We're listening to it and you were like, you should do a show, you should write a book called exit strategies because all the crazy shit that happens on stage to me. So and I. and because of that I've just welcomed it and it's gotten even fucking crazier. Like the Thursday night on stage I had three black guys onstage and we were trying to write a racist white joke, like a joke that would hurt white people's feelings because I've never heard one and I've never heard a joke. Like what do you call a white guy standing in front of a judge? The lawyer I guess like there's no like great racist joke. So we were trying to write one and then these guys.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       And I came to the opinion that only white couples have a hard time getting pregnant. Like that's the big, that's our tragedy. But you never hear like, oh, licorice and right. Were having a hard time conceiving so he can. They were like, we don't know. One black couple has ever had a hard time because even so we tried to write a hurtful white joke, but we just couldn't find the right rhythm anyway. So all these women who have already done it by now, no. The closest we could find were Polish jokes. That's it. Yeah. Polish jokes are effective, but you have to be Polish. That's gonna suck. If you're the one race, that's automatically considered to be kind of a knucklehead race. Yeah. How rude. Well, you know how the Polish people got that right? It was probably because they were illegal immigrants, right? Nope. What it was doing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:16       The Germans rolled through Poland, the Polish, we're really proud and they brought in and tanks and the police came up and started hitting the tanks with sticks. And the Germans are like, are you fucking kidding me? Just and killed. We just killed them off and they're like, these guys are fucking fighting with sticks. But they were proud they were defending their country. So then that started the rolling of Polish jokes. Even put ski came along in the eighties. Who's uh, you know, I haven't put. Ski was a fucking very famous pro wrestler. Polish power. I haven't put ski. It was a little short guy, but he was fucking super yolked. Seriously? Yeah. Polish power. I haven't put ski. Yeah, it was a tank. No, I don't. Anyway, so. No, I don't remember this. No, no, no. That's how Polish no racist joke for wiping. Anyway. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       So that's what we were doing on stage and then we end up doing a shot of Tequila and then we're all, we all get off and then with these guys heard me on this podcast and said, man, your shit wild. So wild on the road and all these stores were crazy. Let's see if we can try to capture lightning in a bottle, will follow you for a month on the road and just document it and see if we can find some good stories that happened. Should should've fucking fuck came this weekend. It was chaos this weekend. But, but so then they, they made this proposal, put it on kickstarter. It's on kickstarter. Brian, can you find it? If you just type in kickstarter and then go and then in the search type and burt you'll find it and every dollar you donate you get something back. Whether it's a credit in the movie, like a thank you in the movie.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       A personal workout session in my man cave. Like a tee shirt. He's got a man cave without alligator hands and everything for the whole fucking man cave. You got a man cave in your house? Oh, it's the best thing that's ever happened to life. Wow. Oh, remember you when you show me your, your, uh, your, uh, garage Mahal. The Gym. Yeah. And I was like, Oh, I think I'm getting a man. Man-Cave I gotta fuck it, man cave. So after that you got out. Did you make it yourself? Diy Networks? Tony started Uzzah. Jason Cameron came to my house, a man cave. My Shit. Wow. The best thing that has ever happened in my life. When does it air? It's already here. It's already here, but if you have ever had something so positive happening in your life and like a week that you're like, I'm totally dying, I'm going to die in St Louis.

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       No, I'm going to die before that happens. I'll never get to see the. Because it was so cool. I was so excited for it. So yeah, but. So what exactly did they do? The A to 60. Someone's going to come rob me, but to 60. Don't give out your address. Flat screen. Three d TV's a keg rater, a wine refrigerator, a thousand cigar humidor. All 200 year old reclaimed lumber on the inside from a barn in Indiana. They, uh, a desk in there as a back of a corvette. It's kind of cheesy, but it looks cool, like, you know, and they fucking polished. Then they, then they sealed up the one part, the old entrance. It was a door and they open up a wall to the backyard and put in these humongous, a fucking open like French doors. 10 foot French doors that open up to the backyard, put fill. The whole backyard was 1700 square feet of pavers. Gave me a fire pit. I mean you're just supposed to make the man cave. And they were like and Tony's Goossen and Jason and I got along and they're like, fuck it. Let's call out. It's like a hundred grand. They dropped on this fucking mannequin.

Speaker 3:          00:10:23       It makes my shit. It's like when you see me, like when you see me naked,

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       I've outgrown my Dick, my Dick. Smaller than my waist. More. They should be all my body. That's what my house looks like compared to my man cave. A big guy with a little tiny dick. It's wow. That's fucking awesome. Just increased the value of your house. Probably we won't be able to for that shit. Yeah. No, but it's the best thing that we only hang out with Medicaid, but I'm going to go inside anymore. Do you have to pay more taxes when your house is worth more? Even if you already own it? Yeah, I think so. That's what they told us. They were like, is that true? Is that like people are people at old houses? I thought as if he's getting it appraised or if he sold it. I didn't know if it will. If you just added to it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:10       Finances were exactly. Men Boys, Lego my thing. He just call Santa Claus with free hug coupon cat pictures and heard those guys like cats with Brian. Brian. He's just talking about 10 different things. Oh, is crazy. I go, do you have add? And he goes, yeah, yeah, maybe. Maybe, maybe it doesn't matter. I'm highest fucking shit right now. Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       We did a podcast this morning with a grower and he was with a grower. Yeah. So let's do some dangerous characters. Those growers to grow marijuana. It's not easy. I tried in New York. Did you? Yup. I grew up plant on my, on my fire escape, and I was just like, I was just water it and I'll get some sun. It will be perfect. And then so then growing. It's one thing. Then you got to drive the shit out. Like you've got to drive much. How big did it get about the. About the size of my hand. Whoa. The buds. No, no, no. You know, let's just ballpark it and just say it was marijuana. I'm not even sure what I grew up. I definitely smoked it and I definitely grew it and I dried it and we got high, but I don't know, it didn't look like the kind of weed you buy. So it was just shit weed. You fucked up really bad read.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       Well I think it's like anything else. You got to really look into it. You know, I have a good friend who is a professional grower and has been forever and went to jail time. Mccormick has been on the podcast before todd's been. He's a, he's a legit grower though. You know what I mean? I mean he grows for, you know, to Spencer's.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       It's so difficult. Right. It's like I felt you just plant a seed. You gotta Let. Well you can. I mean it does. It's. It is wild. Yeah. But it can grow on its own. Yeah. But they would. This was when I was working at Barnes and noble when we grew it, so I brought up with good on the basement, read books on marijuana growing and you have to like put it in, you have to put it in. I'm like a moist towelettes in the refrigerator and let the stems like let us start seeding and then plant it like you can't just bury it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       No, because people throwing the fucking weed out the window when they were being chased by cops and the grows because of the seeds take into the side of the road

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       grows if there's definitely a pop liquid or my parents stopped because there are tons of seeds under. There are so many factors. You have to have parasites. We got parasites. It's like little little bugs one time and they just killed our whole crop. Something in our house. Yeah, and there's a lot of shit you have to worry about growing, but yeah, that also then you have the miracle bugs that just.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       It's not to me, it's not like in this, in this day and age, it's like the only way I would do it, the only for, the only reason was because like they say that about mushrooms as well, that when you grow them that you develop a relationship with them, like they connect with you because you're nurturing them and taking care of them and then when you actually finally eat it, it gives you even more of a high real. It's almost. Yeah, because it's almost like they say like there's a difference between going hunting and buying a steak at the grocery store. There's a whole process that skipped when you buy the steak at the grocery store, so you just become this sort of non thankful gelatinous fucking Slob who just say you don't have to be able to get that thing. That thing is already provided for you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       Were you the person talking about eating only like eating only like deers and like running me, it means so much sense. I was on a plane piss drunk listening to that and I was like, fuck that. I was my own personal theory

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       thing that things are difficult to catch. I probably way better for you. Yeah, that makes sense. Because you got to be clever to catch them. You got to be clever to catch a deer. You're going to be clever to catch a fish, you know? That's why they're really good for you. There is so filled with nutrients in there. They know that that's why they're running like crazy. The reason why they're running like fast and cows are just kind of wandering in excuse cows or retards and are supposed to take them out and you know, deer are two. They're just faster.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       Maybe if that that's suppose to be a challenge because you're not supposed to eat it though. Kind of like a. like a snake has crazy colors and it to warn you off. If it had thumbs you, it would be eating you. That's all. You have to realize. I've had snake snake, I bet to make red rattlesnake rattlesnake every. I had. I had one when we did the extra we did. They had a smorgasbord of, of crazy animals like lion and tiger, and it was just fucking. Oh, I see

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       growing your own shit, man. I think there's something to that. I think there's something to that because if you talk to a guy that's, you know, like that's gone hunting and they'll talk to you about eating the food that you caught yourself, whether it's a fucking rattlesnake or this whole shows on it about where they go. And you know, when people go and sustain themselves off the land, like there was that guy that was on your network. Um, but wild within Don wildman did the wildest thing. I don't remember his name. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that still going on? Is that they cancel it? No, but I want that dog that he went hunting boars with. That's the fucking dog. Oh, the dogs that logged they show is this show was really hardcore and they, those dogs attack people though this dog hits attack people less than those dogs.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       Are you shitting my most pits or not? Their dog aggressive number. Then there are people, aggressive dreams. Are they. Because my dog, I used to have a pit that was a Hawaiian boar hunting. I want the Doggos Argentinos. Yeah, those are the dangerous ones. Those are those ones that bite people don't like the size of a great Dane, but the body of a pit, huge pit bulls is what they are and they use them for hunting bores. They hold onto the board and then this guy comes along on fucking the travel channel and stabs him to death with a knife. That's how they killed the bore. They grab it and then you come along and slice it's fucking throat right there. I mean it is down and gritty. And I watched that show and I was like, wow, what a show. This is like this show. I mean we used to have a show. It's a fucking good God damn show. Why did they cancel it?

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       You know, it's the same shit that happens with everything good. What it is, it's too much right up front for everyone. So what they'll do now, I guarantee you tlcl do a show called boar hunting and that'll be the show. That's how these, like I did what I did when we did birth conquer, we went a cafetiere scrabbling where you put your hand on. Oh yeah, yeah. If I catch a fish called noodling, noodling catfish, grappling dog in whatever redneck plays you're in, they have a different name for it. Grappling, grappling, Eman Gary a shit. Fuck. Yeah, because you're doing it with rednecks. Who you never think they felt the whole plant through. The guys like Greg. He goes, he's go on and shelby, I will hand back in Uganda and Rwanda and you're going to nibble now when you feel a nipple, you better hold on that day as a and not a alligator snapping turtle or a beaver.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       I was like, there's a fucking. There could be an alligator in there. Like there could be. I was like, how can we get something other than my fucking hand in there? Something that we don't want. I want my hand and then they just like, don't be a pussy boy. Oh my God, man. Let me tell you something. When that fish bites on God, you feel like a fucking warrior. Like, oh cause it, cause it's, it's, it's go time, like I'm waving at you, just, it's like Flash Gordon, you got your hand in a hole and you're and you're underwater and you're waving your arm and back in a hole and you can hear the thump. It thumps when it starts rolling and you're like, and you can hear it under water, right? Because it took fucking 50 pound catfish and then all of a sudden he goes, you won't feel to nibble. I was like, yeah, fuck a car door slamming on my hand, just Bam. And I pull a 50 pound kapish out of a 20 pound hole. It's like pulling a kindergarten round, a whole just like, what the fuck is it? It's massive. And then I panicked. I just dropped it. I go get him.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Then they started, they go, what the fuck is you doing? Get up on it. And I was like, I have no fucking idea to get. Um. So did you still have it? It was flipping around. It was, there were three girls there because it's, the whole pitch was that they do it with girls and the girls definitely do it. The girls definitely catch catfish, but the dudes like set it up, you can totally tell the dudes are setting it up and uh, and then the catfish whereby a boat dock, a ramp where a boat goes in and so the catfish, I throw it and it became a boise and it went over to the dock and he started swimming up the boat, ramp up the boat ramp. So I just run and just jumped all over you. A fumble lands on the catfish and just like all my body weight grabbed it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       And then a lot of them have spines to be really careful. I wish I had thought that whole thing through and stab, you know. No, I was totally fine. Oh my God. And I've been stabbed by campus, but if you see their spines, yeah, I used to fish a lot when I was a kid. Really uncertain cat fish when you catch them, when you pick them up, man, get stabbed by their dorsal fins. Know there's pictures of it online if you want to see how big the catfish was. It was, it was monster and I just dove on it and then, and then, then I was like, I was a fucking liberal because liberal bent again because they were like, I was. I was like, you know, I'm all excited. I'm jazz, I'm talking to the other redneck. And I'm like, Oh man, that was fucking intense.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       Like, that's so crazy. Like what fucking makes her bite my what makes it bite my hand? And he goes, well she protecting her babies and I was like, what? He's like, there's babies in that hole. That's why she's protecting her babies. And I went, I just pulled a fucking mom away from her kids and I started thinking like, like what if someone just lifted my wife away from my children and they were just sitting in a hole going, does anyone know how to make a grilled cheese? Like just fucking panicking. You're a Dick Burke. So then so then I get down, I get down on the thing and I were trying to run water through it skills. I'm just pushing it back and forth like I'm fucking just so that's how you keep it alive, keep it alive, and then I just let it go and he just went and he goes, what the fuck did you do?

Speaker 2:          00:20:44       I was like, she got away. I didn't mean for it to happen. He was like, Oh, you lied. You have fucking told her that. I was like, I can't let. I can't let that happen. I'm jumping off a fucking God damn bridge. Extra catfish. Went back there and ate dollars. Kids so stressed out. We ended up catching for the entire days. We ended up back there. A bunch of them just slaughtered their babies and now there's a catfish, a show the show. So that was what my whole point of saying that is that that's how that works is that you'll, you'll, they'll see something really good like that guy and then I guarantee you that I take that back. There is a fucking show. It's called Hoggin. There is a fucking show. I just heard about this. There was a show called hog and it's all about a feral hogs and I could tell you in two seconds because the production company that I was at birth, the conquerors does birth, conquer, produces hoggin. Well, we don't realize

Speaker 5:          00:21:36       is out here in the city. We don't realize out here with the white man what the, what the real fucking problem is with the white man. Was that a real. What I mean with the, uh, the urban man as I should have said,

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       city, city, urban, using the correct term. The person living in a city, urban, white, urban, urbanized is white people. Fuck organs. Our special is so fucking good. Okay, let's start. Sorry, you threw me completely off track. Let's talk about urbanites. Excellent. Um, what was I saying? Well, we don't understand.

Speaker 5:          00:22:13       Oh, that how big of a fucking problem. Wild hogs are wild hogs to people that live in rural areas. There are fucking huge problem, man, because there's not a lot of people chasing after him. So they're constantly breeding and they're smart as fuck. And they hide from people and they destroy entire farms. They just fuck up crops. They just come in and there's not shit you can do about them, so you can hunt them all year round. There's no bag limit on them because at this point they are literally an infestation like we're lucky we don't live there. Could you imagine if you went outside and you're fucking backyard and there's wild pigs, big ones.

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       Fucking tusks. Hundreds of pounds took out the king on game of thrones. Was a fucking pig sending. Well Watch the game was going to hog hunting and they got them to drunk in the hall. Gordon and Toro to stomach. So he died. Yeah. Those fucking things are obese. I had a friend, James App, Thorpe, who used to hunt them and I don't know why you can't just shoot them with a bone arrow or something and get close to them. Oh really? The dogs find them down. The

Speaker 5:          00:23:14       dog's grabbed them and bite them and hold them down. My, my pit that I to have frank, he was a hog hunting dog from Hawaii. He was so crazy. Craziest dog I've ever had. Really? And yeah, he was a great dog with people, but he was so animal aggressive, like a never seen anything like this and killed two of my cats. He just, he was always like, cats would fuck with him. He'd be fine with them and then they would piss in the corner or something. He would just decide, all right, I'm going to kill one of your fucking cats. It would just go kill one. It was, it was no joke. My. He would only do it.

Speaker 6:          00:23:45       I don't mean to be laughing, but it's just.

Speaker 5:          00:23:48       He would only do it when I wasn't around. That's the crazy thing in front of Eddie Bravo and once in front of my wife. That's what burt, you keep on saying you went to this crazy dog that's. You don't want those dogs, Bro. Trust me. You might want to talk to him and just get a nice dog wars in my house. I've had dogs killed dogs, but you don't. Yeah. You don't know what that's like. Do you come home and one of your female pitts has killed the other female pit or killed her dead in your living room? And I got to clean up the blood. Yeah, dude, he's not a joke. The those animals or they look cool because you and I are both 15 year old boys at heart, so like fucking look at that fucking animal on that. Dude, I want to have that.

Speaker 5:          00:24:26       They're very dangerous and people get on me all the time because I say this shit. I see this as a guy owned pits for 10 years. I still love pits. I think they're amazing dogs. They're so fucking intelligent because the cruel nature of dog fighting. Because the way it's set up, they only allowed the purest of the bloodline to survive. They kill off the ones that quit to kill off the ones that don't want to fight to kill off the ones that don't show absolute courage and no human aggression. They're not supposed to ever be aggressive to humans. The only attack dogs. And that's way that way men can get in there and separate the dogs as they're fighting. So what you develop is this super loyal, loving wants to please you has this incredible drive like no other dog. The driver pitbulls insane. They will jump up and hold onto a tire with their jaw for an hour.

Speaker 5:          00:25:17       Just hang there. Their drive is so different than any other dog, and until you've appreciated that you, you really, you don't. You don't know why people love those dogs so much, but they're dangerous fact. They're dangerous with dogs. They're dangerous with little people. They're dangerous with old people. My dog did not like old people, so one of my biggest fears was that old people would come by my fence and he'd go, it wasn't like, you know, hey, better back the fuck away from the fence. It's like, I've got this. I got this. It was like his prey drive sense that this person was no longer a person anymore. There was so weak and so old that his killer instinct, like that's what you go after. That's what a killer animal goes after. They see a weakness like hyenas. You can raise hyenas as a pet, but if you show any signs of weakness, like if you limp in front of a Hyena, you better hope that fucking has got a muzzle on or you better hope that things got a muzzle on because it won't be able to protect it. We're one people to help itself. It won't be able to help itself even though you've raised it your whole life. If a hygienist sees you limping the lock on you with those fucking crazy eyes and the strongest snapping jaws known to mankind in the mammal world at least, and they just take a big chunk out of your asshole. That's your pet hyena that you want to do. You want this cooler, cool. 200

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       pound beast, but you fucked up and went and played tennis and you gotTa Limp and you came home with me and it just eats you.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       It would be so. You need that. Start watching dogs. One one to really know about animals. I've been researching dogs for the better part of every single weekend. I'm on the road. All I do,

Speaker 5:          00:27:02       my pal Bryan County, and I talk about this all the time because we've all, we've had pit bulls or whole life and I've called Brian in the middle of dog fights and his dogs fighting one of his dogs. It's just his, his, his ex girlfriend's dog was this amazing dog, was also this crazy pit bull that was constantly getting in fights. They get in fights, man. Period. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. It's very hard to stop that shit and it's not just the bureau, it's not just the boys, the girls, the girl dogs are hyper aggressive. There

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       were your parents. Were your parents like you buy them as puppies?

Speaker 5:          00:27:31       Two of them, what will. One of them is a puppy and two of them I rescued two of them you rescue and they were both very different, but both very fucked up. One of them was a full, full grown two year old female and she had mange all over her body and I saw her. I found her friend. A friend found her and then I came to he. They called me and said, we found this dog, you know, are you still interested in adopting a dog? And I saw her and she was just. She had the sweetness eyes and covered in mange and I was like, oh my God, I have to save this dog. It was just like, this dog was like, I don't know what to do. Hey, I'm just a nice dog. I'm a sweetheart. And she was the sweetest dog. She was. So. Except if she thought you were trying to take too much attention from me or accept. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Any dog she would fucking snap them and bite them in the face and fucking grabbed. It was a weird thing, man. They have this incredible desire for human attention and approval.

Speaker 2:          00:28:21       All right. Then we'll just get a friendly dog. Man. I want. Here's what I want. I want the other. I was telling you guys, this is when we walked in for the morning or the night. My doorbell rang in the middle of the night. I'm home. The one night I'm home in the, in the week the doorbell rings. Both girls are in bed with me and lands in the girls room and I start panicking thinking this is how it goes down. That ring the doorbell. You go to the door, you turn off the alarm, you opened the door. That's what a soccer would do. Not Me because I'm fucking. Because I'm already five steps ahead of them. So I take the girls in the, in the bedroom with Leanne, I go everyone out the fucking window. I'm going to stop whatever is happening, but you guys out the window out the back door, go to the corner of Laurel Canyon and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:29:00       this is before even go to the door before

Speaker 2:          00:29:02       I go to the fucking door because I'm like four in the morning. Get a gun, a doorbell for we, we haven't gotten. We haven't gotten the doorbell. Four in the morning. What the fuck? There's no, no good is coming out of that. There's nothing good. No one's like, hey, I broke down. We live in a fucking busy intersection like we're a block away. So I just fuck in. I start panicking. Leanne, as I'm in talking to Leanne, I hear the doorbell go again and I'm like, uh, now I'm like, you will you ever get like, where your asshole just goes wide, like wide open like hall, and you're like, oh fuck. And I go, do you hear it? And she goes, it's the girls music, the girls music's playing. That's not the doorbell is the music. So I'm like, okay. So it wasn't the fucking doorbell, but then I thought to myself,

Speaker 4:          00:29:44       so I'm not crazy. So then I'm like, fuck it. I want a beast in my house that is willing to give its life for my family. I want somebody that is going to. I got an alarm system and I got a gun. No, no, no. That's a good idea to have a dog. I just don't recommend pitbulls. I don't need to impress a canary in recommending those, those, those dogs that, those are the dogs that uh, that actor killed a man who, who's the guy who was in pulp fiction? The black dude with a shaved head. What the fuck's his name? Names. Yeah, thing. Graham's had a let's find. Let's find the article so we know.

Speaker 7:          00:30:19       Yeah, my dogs the best guard dog. So if he starts barking, that means there's somebody around my house and it's all in its brief because there's a Pekinese. It was a, uh, that's what it was bred for as an alarm system dog.

Speaker 4:          00:30:29       Yeah. Is this going to alarm dogs? Kill worker at ving? Rhames home or a 40 year old man was mauled to death by as many as four dogs at the home of ving rhames before,

Speaker 7:          00:30:42       before Joe's dogs went crazy and went crazy. He used to have me babysit his dogs when he was out of town, so I'd bring my girlfriend at the time and we'd go there to feed the dog. And one time she's like feeding the dog and the dog like bitter in the hand. But it was kind of like a, was that a playful bite or fight? But I was so scared. Every time I would go to his house because of that, you can tell some dogs you just can't trust. That's why I'm surprised that little guy in that TV show pit boss. I'm surprised I didn't even alive shop was hanging out with lions. Yeah, I mean there's dogs are the size of him. Yeah, and he's like, no, they're just good. They can take an Rv. He rescued a dog that was all fucked up and beat up from dogfights the other day in an alley and it was just him and his dog that had open wounds that just got done with a fucking.

Speaker 7:          00:31:24       They've staged that show. There's so much stage. At one time they were like, they were like good that he showed up and there was a pit bull in a dumpster and I was like, you know that some pa was like, how close are they? Why don't you have to put a pebble in the dumpster? Shows. Definitely fake like 90 percent of that 90 percent of all those fucking show. I can't even sit through half of them anymore. When you watch the setup, like you're like, well like hulk Hogan walks in and he's like, well my agent just called, looks like we're going into the Bermuda this weekend. And they're like, but I have these friends. I'm like, fucking seriously. I watched, I watched the, uh, the new. What's uh, what's the girl had the new Paris Hilton one on its own. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:03       What's owns that? Oprah's Oprah's network. Has a Paris Hilton Shell for real. Paris Hilton's got to say that to him. Paris whole gun. Show this to me. You're going to be doing. Whereas hold on, let's finish this job. I show and then leave the newsletter this month she'll gets. Oh, Paris Hilton. Huge Joe. Oprah Winfrey Fan. Sorry. Show from combining them. People think I'm not really Oprah Winfrey, Oprah Winfrey. I think that if I was an old woman who didn't get any deck, I think she was God show Oprah. If I was a 40 year old women,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       slightly overweight trying to find, you know, sense in my life and religion that didn't work out for me. But I just, Oprah speaks to means, you know, I think she's doing the right thing. Paris blames oxygen for new shows.

Speaker 2:          00:32:53       Oh, it's a good show. It was not a good show, but it's like so staged, like so stage

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       blaming. She Paris is furious that the show didn't premier at the time. It was supposed to listen to this, she worked her tail off doing promotion and publicity for the show and then because of a technical mistake that show aired in a completely different time and a lot of markets,

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       uh, every fucking TV show on cable,

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       she's getting pissy because.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       Because the way to network the cable networks work is you premier on the East Coast at 8:00. Well then that means on the west coast, your premieres at 5:00 and then your, is that like 6:00? It doesn't work. Normal. All the ratings were fucked up for all those networks because the way cable setup, she's just stupid because you do, she never paid attention to it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:43       Now stupid. When did they start dividing shows up where they would show like, you know, lost at 6:00 PM on the east coast, but 9:00 PM, you know what I mean? Like when did, when did they do that? Did they use to do it? Like where, you know, they, they, the whole country aired cbs at the same time. So people had to watch lost at six PM and La, is that right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       No, no, no, no. If you have direct tv then then you will be able to see the premiere at 5:00.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Of course, of course, but what I'm saying is when did they start switching it up? When did they start having to broadcasts? I think they did that for awhile. Yeah. Did they always have to feel that they had an east coast and the west coast? I think so because after awhile they'd probably, they probably figured out like when do people want to watch TV? They get home from work at five ish, six, eight, seven ish. Eight ish is good. Eight to 10 inches good and then we're tired and we got to go to bed or you're a Weirdo and you hate your life and your staff and you watch late night. I don't think they know

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       at all what they're doing. Anyone who's programming television, it has to be demand. They need to switch it to no way to figure out what do you like? Do you really think anyone saw jersey shore are going to be a hit now? There's

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       like people that know, look, look, we just. UFC just signed a deal at Fox and we had, I had a fucking suit, like a retard. I look like such a monkey's Fox or Fx, Fox, fx and fuel. So a Fox TV is gonna have the big fights. Fx is going to have the ultimate fighter and a bunch of fight nights and fuel's going to have some programming on, on as well. And a no brainer, but it's sorta been good. Those guys, no fucking sports like when you see like all the mines comparing notes and trying to figure out the best way to market things and push things. Like there's a level of like they're, these guys know how to push shows. They know how to promote shows, you know, how to make things happen. But you're right, there's a lot of people that are doing that don't know what the fuck they're doing, especially executives when it comes to, in my opinion, creative issues where it comes to like see like comedies and things along those lines when you have editors or you have rather, um, executives that are interjecting their ideas. It almost is never good for the funny. Almost never, so they fucked that up, but it's for sports. I think they know exactly what the fuck they're doing. You know what I mean? It's like they can affect the outcome. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       Course you're not going to you. There's no way for an executive to throws to sense into an MMA fight.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       They can't help themselves. Man. Their ego is so fucking strong ego that gets you to the position to be a high level executive. Your Ego, your shelf fucking right. You're so. No, you're fucking right. You know you're right. And so it's so hard for them to like just let you make a show because until that show is south park where they just leave it alone because it's a monster and comedy central. A guarantee. They south park probably doesn't even lead comedy central. Call them

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       probably. You don't have my number. You don't get my numbers stupid. Yeah. It's quite like you don't get my number dummy just on Tuesday. I'm going to send a package to you and it will have the new episode and we'll do this every week. That's Louis ck show show. His deal is earned as a speculation. It's just, it's like the rumor mill, but that he doesn't make a ton of money but they aren't allowed to touch his show. That's amazing. And everyone needed for sure. He has to pass it by them. No, I know. He throws it back.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       Things that they have, they've seen him do. They've accepted that. He didn't think they were going to accept. Oh really? Yeah. He did an article where he's talking about. It was like, really? We can do this. We can get away with this.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       That's the. It's the fucking ultimate. I love x now. That's one of my favorite channels because they have a lot of good shows now. They have the Philadelphia show. They have there that Louis show and last night I was watching the Louis show and deduct Stan hope episode. Awesome episode, but I was also watching him talk about masturbation. He was using the word calm. He was talking in great detail, but she likes to masturbate and stuff and they're like, this is awesome. Fx letting him say I love when people talk about. There was no sensory. No, there was there, it was great seeing cable now embracing that like, hey, we're just not going to touch these show. Well, you know, it doesn't have to. The FCC doesn't regulate them. We don't

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       realize that. Most people don't realize that. You see hpo you think that the reason why hbo has swears is because Hbo the. Oh, you pay for it, so it's okay. Yeah. But no, it's okay. Through all of cable. Yeah. They're just losing their belts though. These channels are loosening their belts and seat. The realizing because the Internet that people have different sensibilities. It's just the same people that are listening to this podcast are also watching blank on TV. They're also watching football. They're also watching baseball. You know, I think people are realizing now that people's sensibilities are a lot broader.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       It's the advertisers is who's taking it away from him. Like I think, I think our, I don't want to fucking to show, but I think I heard a

Speaker 1:          00:38:23       um, uh, the league

Speaker 2:          00:38:27       fucking rent as easy as easy saying they're gonna do whatever the fuck they want. It's just how much are you willing to lose from advertisers for gain, you know, it's, have to find the right advertisers,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       you know, I mean like the UFC had a hard time finding the proper advertises for while, but then they got bud light and then they get Harley Davidson and you know, it's now it becomes, you know, it becomes something that's easy to, to, to, to connect with, you know, it's successful. It's one something is not successful yet. That's when it gets weird. Like South Park thing. Dude, think of some of these shit they've done on south park. Think of when they had the whore off, would that gay guy and Paris Hilton and he shoved pair of silver in his asshole. You never that never seen south to sound park. It's never seen. South South Park is, it is an American gem. It's, what's the word I'm looking for? It's a treasure. It's a cultural treasure that shows a cultural treasure. I don't watch it as much as I should, but it's fucking

Speaker 2:          00:39:25       brilliant of art. I only know. I can only speak from American Justice League or team team America, whatever it was fucking made me laugh. My team, America world police, the funniest fucking thing of all time. One of the funniest movies of all time. It's exactly what South Park is. Yeah, but I never got into. I never got it

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       did genius. It's genius. It's the best comedy as far as that kind of like silly animation type shit that's ever been created ever. In my opinion. I don't think anybody can fuck with them. I mean the simpsons obviously are brilliant and there's a lot of formulas, but there's still have the simpsons.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       I can't watch family guy either. Oh, I love that. I live alone. If you opened me up, it's bleeds playing the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       It bothers me that South Park likes this shit on family guy so much. Sometimes it hurts my feelings and I like family guy. Family guy is stupid. I agree. It's not as good as South Park. It's different, but it's very short attention span. I could just sit there and just be taken away on this little silly journey. You know? It's a good show, man. Family guy is a good show.

Speaker 2:          00:40:23       I don't know. I haven't seen American dad either. I want what I like is that moment when you realize the brilliance, like the first time you were watching family guy, I was like, what's this? And then the joke hit and you're like, oh fuck, that's. So I remember when someone was, uh, I think that thing was someone was choking in the front yard and Peter ran out and, and Brian and the dogs sitting there and Peter runs out and he goes, don't worry, I know how to do this. I can do the Heimlich maneuver. I read it in a book. And Brian Goes, Peter, you sure you read it in a book, are you sure? Just wasn't nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       And I heard that and I just started laughing so fucking hard. And this wasn't nothing, nothing. That's such a weird bug in live.

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       So I tried to get Leanne to my wife to watch family guy and she, she'd sit there and watch it with me and just didn't get it. And then the one time where Peter fell and skinned his knee

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       for like five minutes anyway. And then all of a sudden my wife just starts laughing hysterically and she goes, looks at me. She's like, how long is he going to do that for it? I was like, that's a funny joke. That's what he's

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       done is brilliant. I love those moments where you fucking get it. You know, like the, we're just clicks in your head and you go, oh, that's funny shit. Like I want those all the time. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Mcfarland's a cool dude too, man. I met him. I did a voice on a. I Guess I did myself on, on wasn't buried meet. No, they parodied me on American Dad, but on family guy came in and actually did the voice and he was so nice. He was so cool. What's it like to be buried? Parodied? It was weird. Well, it didn't sound anything like me. It was like I pulled up in a car and I was drinking and I was like talking about strippers or something, which I guess is how they thought of me, which is kind of funny. What if he had really hit home and it really touched. What if it was me last night it was drinking. I was looking for strippers and my accent did sound anything like me either. It's just, it's just a bad accident. I would love it if no one's ever been able to do an impression of me. You know, there's certain guys that you can imitate their voice, like, like anyone can do an arnold schwartzenegger

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       pressure. I wish I could do impressions right now. I totally. Let's try to do it joe real quick. You can't do it. I always. Jeffrey.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       Jeff Richardson was convinced that he could. Jeff Bridges was convinced that he could do it for a while.

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       He was good at. He's good at it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       Yes. He couldn't do me though. He didn't have it. I'm sure someone out there could, but he couldn't. Yeah. Morris a and maybe not. No.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       Joe's. Joe's got a 50 year old woman in like, hey. Yeah. Hi here. Checked out. Take time to tell you about all fucking Duncan trussell's. Can we just take a second? Okay. Appreciate Duncan King. Obsessed with him. He. I could listen. I listened to him on this and they're not assessed with him the way he talks. I want to talk.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       He's a. he's one of my favorite human beings. He's a fascinating guy. I listen to this audio. I'm Ron Bennington's interviewing Penn Jillette and it was so good. It was such a good interview that I had an email pen right afterwards and just tell him. I'm like, dude, you like, he is such an interesting guy and he was talking about so many cool things. It was really a fun interview man, but one of the things that he said was that the person who's in the room, when you come up with something, the person who's in the room when you're bouncing an idea around the person you're bouncing with has an effect on that idea. The person you're in, the conversation where it's like if you'd come up with the most brilliant idea and his thing was that the people that are like say if you came up with an idea for something, the people that were in the room with you should claim half of that, that that project. Totally because you would not have come up with that project, you weren't in their presence and I'm like, that is so true. And Duncan trussell's the perfect example for that, both with him and with me because Duncan has always said that like he never goes as deep into the rabbit hole as he does when he's on this show

Speaker 2:          00:44:28       is lavender lavender hour is nothing. This show it's nothing. It's. It is. It's a lot. It's a lot lighter. But man, when he's talking to you, you guys go into some deep shit where I am. Sometimes they'll give me panic attacks.

Speaker 5:          00:44:43       He's given me some very interesting insight on the possibilities, you know, and a lot of people say, well it's just fucking stupid hippie. What if, what if talk, you know, and that is a lot of it, but there are, I'm not sure what this is and I don't think you are either. I think you can pretend that you're sure because it makes you feel better at night and you can, you can pretend that everything that you can't, you can't hit with a hammer isn't real and it's just your imagination. It's just what? What the fuck is consciousness, man? What is this? What is life? What is this idea that, oh, I'm going to call Bert Kreischer and asked him to come over to my house and burt somehow or another navigates his way through space and time and arrives at my doorstep and us friends get to communicate and we're talking into some fucking thing that takes all of our voice and all the shit that we say and throws it through some Internet and breaks it down to ones and Zeros where it's then interpreted by other people's computers in real time. What the fuck is this? Don't tell me you know what this is. This is the bizarreness. If life wasn't real, it would be the craziest psychedelic trip ever. It's almost like when a real psychedelic trip is something you're not used to, something you're not just throws you off, but life itself isn't the most uber bizarre thing ever.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       It would seem more plausible to say you would have many lives in different parallels and you could travel through time then to say to someone that we could talk to you from this room into a cave like that. You can send more voices, like if you'd said pitched everything to the cave men and you're like, what's going to be more plausible? Three guys can then talk and it'll just travel around the country and everyone can hear them talk or you just have another life. They'll be like, oh, fuck another life. Definitely, definitely one of another life. I'm definitely. I'm deaf. I completely believe in time travel.

Speaker 5:          00:46:40       Well, you know, they've actually shown like recently the most recent studies say that the speed of light cannot be bypassed, can't, can't surpass the speed of light. So they believe that time travel will be in fact impossible. But that's just

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       bullshit. Fuck your dog. What else do you want to buy? A dog knows whether or not they're correct. We won't find out for a long time. Bird crusher. Hopefully you and I will be alive though. Hopefully if we take our vitamins and eat. While I want to do those brain pills, some guy, I'll give you a bottom. Some guy that's amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:47:28       People, look, people think it's nuts,

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       but I can tell you 100 percent that vitamins have enhanced my, my, my feeling, the way I, the way my body feels and enhance my energy. I believe they give me a call. My body feels clear. It feels like it's less needy. It feels like it's more filled. When when your body is filled with nutrients and you're eating healthy, it works better. I really truly believe that. We know that people died of scurvy because they didn't get enough vitamin C, we know that essential nutrients are very important part of keeping the body vibrant and healthy and when I eat well and I've been eating really healthy lately, I've been drinking this vitamix thing every morning and drinking these blended Kale milkshakes and not milkshakes. It's just, it's just blended Kale and cucumbers and smoothies. Smoothies and I feel really good and because I'm giving my body all this healthy stuff, it feels like it works better.

Speaker 7:          00:48:26       When I take these Alpha brain pills, what they are is nutrients that are supposed to enhance cerebral function. Now, is that a fact? Man? I don't. I don't fucking know and shit. I can't tell you exactly what mean. Cognitive function is a very hard thing to to. Unless you're testing someone, you know, what are you going to do? You're going to make them perform tasks and then they're going to give him these pills and see if they can perform the tasks. I guess it'd be you got to factor in all sorts of other things into account. How do I know that this guy isn't stressed out? How do I know that he's not tired? How do I know that? I'll take it for a month and I'll test, but you know what I'm saying. I'm doing tests. It's like you, you. That's. There's other variables in this person's life, so you'd have to do a lot of tests, but the idea behind them is very sound and that idea is that nutrients can enhance cognitive function and I think they can and I think that these pills do and I know for a fact that I am feeling good during the day.

Speaker 7:          00:49:21       I feel like I have even energy and I'm having dreams man my dreams or a stray psycho with my grandparents yesterday it felt like it was real shit. Do you realize their dreams in the middle of them? No, because I'm doing that all the time, but the detail was amazing. Like I, I was remembering this old photo of my grandfather I saw a long time ago and he had the exact same suit on the St Pants on. I saw this photo once at my mom's house, but my mom, I was telling my mom about it. She sent me the photo. I'm like, that's exactly what I saw my grandfather wearing and the dream to the exact detail. Well, what is it about remembering the dreams? Because that's the most shocking. There's two shocking things that these pills have done for me is for us to remember one, remembering dreams and to being lucid in the middle of a dream. I stayed in a dream. I was in a dream and I stayed in the dream. I said, oh, well this is just a fucking dream, and I just. I didn't even go lucid, like I didn't try to control it or move around. I just let the dream play out, but I realized it was a dream and I still didn't wake up. I have a. that's a rare thing. Pills, just for that. Dreams. I have dreams. I have fucking crazy

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       dreams, but I am totally lucid inside my dreams. Dreams that I'm reading something and I'll go. I'll be to go. Wow, that's so funny that I'm reading something because nothing's there in the dream. I'll think this. Nothing's there in my mind is making up these words, but I'm still reading them. That's so interesting. I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walked into his potel room and there were four dudes, but fucking

Speaker 3:          00:50:47       right, and I just hear me who they were.

Speaker 4:          00:50:52       Be One of the best sentences ever created. I had a dream that I was with Elvis and we walked into his dressing room. There was four dudes, but fucking dot, dot, dot. Now hear me out.

Speaker 3:          00:51:04       It gets weird or they're throwing up in Burger King Cups just walking each other and then I. When I say this, I fucking just shut the door and I looked at Elvis. I go, what the fuck's going on in your room? He said to me, what's your Dream Baby? Oh Shit. I wake up, I wake up. I'm like, wake up, check my. Make sure it's. I'm like, well, you don't really put me out. You don't really put me out. Not that the guys were both fucking right. That they didn't know it was the product placement. Like what the fuck did Burger King do to get it? How the fuck? What if they figured it out yet? You

Speaker 4:          00:51:48       just don't know that there is way to interject advertising into your dreams in the future. Right now it's like I got chrysler stream about the Elvis and the butt. Fucking ha ha. No, no, no, but what is. There's a possibility that someone could insert a product to a dream, right? They could give you a cheeseburger and that cheeseburger with some experimental thing that would make you think about burger king in a dream and see a burger and a dream. Do it. You can do it. It's going Geico and shit. Yes, in the future, but that doesn't make any sense because donald duck noises. It's Geico. You have to eat something to have this happen to you. We're. We're missing the whole packet. We're stumbling on something very brilliant right now. Well, the idea is a possibility, but it's like, you know, 100 years in the future, but 100 years, if you're drinking booze here, one of the rare booze pod test, these guys, these pussies, that drinking corona lights, I got a heineken like a man tall tomboy.

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       What if you could bring your wife's brain by talking to her while she slept? Well, people think that you can do that. People think that you can hypnotize people while they're sleeping and they believe they can do that. You know, hypnosis guys believed that they can control all sorts of behavior by putting people under, so if you are already under and they started talking to you, if a guy can really hypnotize you, that's the book that those comics cannot be human. They can't do it too. You know the kids with anyone. I don't believe. No, no, no. You're wrong. You're wrong. One hundred percent do it for Santos was a good friend of mine. He was already to hit the test in a Bosch and say, good friend of mine, a good friend. That was

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       a front. I know, but I shouldn't say like, you're a good friend of mine. I would call you a good friend. I love you. You're a great guy. Good friend of mine. This guy is just a guy that I worked with, but he was a very nice guy and he was. The only reason why I say this, if this was. If he was alive, I would have stuck with a very good friend of mine and one of the reasons why I said is he gave me one of my first headlining gigs. He actually booked some clubs back in Boston and when I was making the transition between being a middle act on the road and a headlight and really I wasn't a headliner as a joke, I was like, goddamn amateur. Really just amateur. The people are paying money to. It's only been doing it a few years, but um, he was one of the few guys that gave me one of the first guys to give me a headline and getting.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       But he had a real hypnosis act. It was legit. We've talked about it on the podcast before. It just wouldn't work with you and it wouldn't work in the eye. We think about things too much because there are people out there waiting to be led and it's very strange because it almost seems like some invasion with the body snatchers, invasion of the body snatchers type shit. There's some people that are on a different frequency than Uri and you can talk to those people and you can get them to believe that they're having sex with Madonna onstage. And then the orgasm. This guy I saw guy orgasm and his pants. Yeah. He talks to 100 percent, paid some money for them. I'd pay money to someone. I used to work at stitches comedy Club in Boston and this guy, Frank Santos would come in every week and he would do like, you know, he had a Gig, like maybe it was a Tuesday night or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       Everyone would feel the way Boston was in the old days in the golden days of comedy. Everyone had a night of the week, you know, like Wednesday night would be Kevin Knox tonight at Nick's comedy stop and one of the nights was Frank Santos night. So Frank Santos would come by and we would sit in the back and watch because it took comics a while for it to go from you just start working at the club. What is this are already did hypnosis to, okay, Frank Santos is onstage, let's go watch. Because that, that. And that was the natural progression. Once you realized it was real, we would always, if I was outside the room and I knew that Frank Santos was on the stage, I had to get in the room to see what he was going to do because he really could get people to believe that they were having sex and he was the r rated hypnotist.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       So it was always, you know, you got your, your, your lines, and it was weird because this weird voice because you barely could understand it because I wrote those words together. Whereas it was together, wasn't it? Okay. Yeah, it was a boobies are on top of you right now. This is where your boobies, you've got big boobies on top of, you know, you're very happy, very happy and boobies. Boobies. And I'm telling you, these morons really do get hypnotized and I think it is just easily. There are some people that their brains work different than you and I. You

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       know what? I'll tell you what I can tell when I've. Because lately I've been playing with fire a little bit on stage. By the way. I just want to say this. I tweeted the link to that documentary if you want to donate. That's what I was trying to fucking time documentary. Just it's on my twitter so if you want to donate, you get Internet savvy bird again, gonna retweet things with the whatever you donate, you get extras with it and it should be an interesting documentary. So thank you joe. So we uh, but so I don't know if it's because of the first time we talked and then you were saying like you, I don't know if you were into it, but then lately I've just been playing with fire on stage to see how far you can take it. And it's bizarre. I don't know if it's hypnotism.

Speaker 2:          00:56:50       It definitely is inhibited them, but there are personalities that you can read from stage and you go that personal play with me, you know what I mean? I'll bring them up. Like I brought these. Blockchain might not have ever been as playful either until they met you and they just this people that are just willing to go with it. Right, right. I did a, I was in Miami and I brought a black chick and a Puerto Rican checkup on stage and I had them cut the lights off and I said, when you said that you were a little urban, and the lady said, did you notice it? I notice them on staying mobile phase and uh, and uh, and I had them cut the lights and I said, let's, let's Improv a threesome. So let's like, let's just cut the lights cut. So it's pitch black so the audience doesn't see anything.

Speaker 2:          00:57:34       The audience can't see anything. It's just, it's like now it's like a radio show. So I go, Oh wow, that's a great idea. So I go, the winters, what are they saying? What the father with the waiters are fucking when at this point when you have a black ticket to Puerto Rican hot onstage with a white guy who let's three, the waiters are fucking just watching. So I go, I go, all right ladies, I'm going to go into the bathroom and shaved my balls. You guys meet each other and then I give them the mic and I walked to the corner of the stage and these fucking chicks have murdered it. They were like, they were like, how big do you think is digs going to be the one girl's back not that big. I bet. And then like I said, well you going to do to him and it's just going back and forth and I'm sitting in the corner stage one, it's fucking magic.

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       I'm not having nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with it. But these girls who come out of their shells and then I walked back in and I go, ladies, I, uh, have shaved my balls, I want you to take a look. And then they start making fun of my Dick and it's just fucking craziness. But, but I do believe you can read people because I, when I said I don't know if I, maybe I just, because I would never do that with a white person. I bought it. Just bring a Puerto Ricans and blacks on stage. You wouldn't try and white people. Like they wouldn't do that. White people have a tendency to try to be funny and they and sometimes because they've listened to my show and it's sometimes I'll say like edgy shit about race because I've taken liberties. They then feel like they can and they'll drop an f bomb or oh, it makes me so on. Urban people are hilarious. I was at this hotel watching them swim, the other,

Speaker 3:          00:59:02       you know, and he just, we just trumped line of the day, urban hotel watching them swim. I can't wait to hear where this is going. It's a special new vacation to the story. That's all I want to know is I want to have a cigarette.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       They just sat there and made me laugh for 30 minutes. Just watching them swim and having fun. They're pushing each other in and stuff like that. It was hilarious. One girl had her phone on and she was trying to hold her phone up above water so it wouldn't get wet. And she's like, well, you better get this phone for me. She threw it

Speaker 3:          00:59:41       country old lady in a kid in the face. She threw it and hit her on

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       kid in the face like she was throwing it out of her friend and it hit her kid. If the kid starts crying and it's the sister, the kid through that kid that was crying into the pool and I guess that kid can't swim. She's like, throw that kid and it was just nonsense. It was 30 minutes.

Speaker 5:          01:00:05       Just stuck with the accent.

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       Mom and beverly hillbillies to Old Lady, a squid delayed all the grandmothers in the corner going through the white guy just watching those swim and you were just sitting there taking notes. It was beautiful. I was in Atlanta, was the big hair festival this weekend. Have you seen the movie good hair? No. It's the best movie ever. Not Best Movie Chris Rock movie. It's so good. You learn so much about black women about it's. It's, it's an eyeopening movie and I really believe every white man, she'll watch it because you realize how much white men and black women have in common about hair. We all have issues with our fucking hair. I was sitting next to Vivica Fox on a plane one time and we just ended up talking about the stuff. Sometimes I'll use a sprint. What's a super millionaires? I sprinkle it in my hair and like I use that to will call you.

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       You use. I was like, I was like, I use like Fox were exchanging Vivica functions. Like you got to use two colors. It makes it look more natural. Like, oh thank you. So, but that whole hair convention was happening in Atlanta. There was a hair convention. Hair convention. Black women have a hard when it comes to hair, if they can't like sleep, just go to bed. They're going to like sleep sitting up like what the fuck are you talking about? A black woman with a thing of hair, like a good hairstyle. You can't just fucking go to bed. They'll sleep sitting up. This movie's amazing. So yes, and first of all, I mean I'm making generalizations right now that I don't want them to sound racist or I want them to sound like I watched a movie about this and I'm. And I maybe didn't pay attention all that well, but they get all their hair from Indian people. Like in the middle. It can be you mean? Yeah. And weeds are expensive as shit. And the brothers got to pay for that shit. Like the.

Speaker 5:          01:01:53       It is weird that we have decided that white girl, that black women have to have white girl hair. Yeah. It's so fucking crazy. Black eyes are allowed to have black hair. He for a while they didn't like sugar ray Robinson. These to have a conch. These to like put some chemicals in their hair to straighten their hair out. And guys like black guys would comb their hair like a white guy.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Have you seen beyonce lately? She has blonde hair now. If you look at her album, like from whatever five years ago.

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       And you look at our album now, it looks like Micheal Jackson, black and white. She's now like gold skin, blonde hair. She looks like a white person now. And then you look at her old album and it looks like she's swimming in a pool and she thinks she's lightening your skin. It it seems like at orange sheet or their photoshopping fuck out everything to photoshop crazy photoshopping her because she does not look black.

Speaker 4:          01:02:46       Get on. I can't blackface, black girl hair. One thing again, they have black hair. You know, why does it have to be.

Speaker 7:          01:02:51       Be like some do, but I think. I think, I mean it's just totally outright better. We've got to be so brutal man. Have you seen the feathers, Dick? Have you seen the feathers? There's this new trend now. Girls are wearing fucking feathers. Like they're fucking egos and shit. It's the dumbest shit ever. Like I keep saying this. How many feathers?

Speaker 3:          01:03:15       It's got attacked by a Falcon Philly and she had a raccoon tail. I guess that's popular right now. We this raccoon tail from your film?

Speaker 7:          01:03:30       Yeah. Kids are wearing these raccoon tails. Like they're animals. Like they're fucking Mario brothers. Like the raccoons. They have raccoon tails and then this girl had a raccoon tail and feathers in her hair. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:03:40       They're like on their way to being a furry but not quite there yet. Baby-Step furries was just wearing raccoon tails. There's some people that just one little thing will help them feel a little bit better man. And if it's a raccoon tail I say, put that thing on. Don't shoot yourself in the head. Get yourself through this. If you need to fucking raccoon tail to make you feel happy, then put it on. Son. What are you? Uh, are you a Fox? You are a man. Police were to have a nice day. I would love to see you in the chimps. Don't have tails. Foxtown. Champs tone. That tells the animal on the chimp. What'd you get? A little chimp? Nope. Just like a little nub of a tail that they would wear a prosthetic asshole that swells in estrus. I wouldn't be willing to do that, but I think that's only for the female. I think the female, her butthole, her nether regions death swell and become enlarged. And the gorge and I tell the mail chimp knows it's time to get freaky.

Speaker 3:          01:04:32       He got caught watching dogs. Fuck on youtube videos watching dogs. Fuck. You've caught yourself watching like four minutes to dogs. Fuck

Speaker 7:          01:04:45       playlist off dog. Fucking playlist on Youtube. You just fucking said it there and get stoned and watch a bunch of dogs. Fuck man. It's kind of funny that we can't watch people. Fuck, you know, you put people fucking on Youtube. They'll pull that shit right off. Did they just pull Tripoli's all if his whole entire youtube account they pulled the whole entire time once because he had this thing called master tents theater where it was girls with like eyeballs glued onto their boobs and it looked like their like their faces and stuff like that and they pulled it from that and just just through long. You don't show the nipple

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       though. They ain't do that. I guess not. And that other girl nipple, you can shut down to youtube type in breastfeeding. It was a seven year old soccer tit. Well, you know that's funny because youtube was very rarely pulled down any of my videos, but one they pulled down was one that I put said Joe Rogan drinks piss. I saw that video. I saw that video and I trained. I put it back up under the title of urine therapy and they let it go through. Go through. Yeah, that's, I don't know if I can drink my own piss [inaudible] right now. We get it. What in your eye? I looked at him. I said, come on, let's do it right now. And he had a sparkle in your eye. Like, Oh yeah, we're doing this marriage. Yeah. There was a moment, man, where you realize we just entered into that chaotic world that you're so comfortable with you.

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       You loved that world, man. You locked onto that. You locked onto that moment. That's why you could do that. So. Well, age man, because I. because I just can't say it. I have a hard time when we were at the know you like chaos, love and enjoy it. This guy, the at the, at the braves game ball. That's going to fucking go everywhere. No, I think you're a skier. At the braves game, gay beer came running up to me. We're in the porch, the chophouse at the end and the back end, the outfield. He comes running and he's like machine and I go, hey man. And he goes, oh, fuck him up. We got to do a shot right now. It's the middle of afternoon, I a Sunday show and I'm like, I can't man, and he goes, come on some machine and I go, all right, let's fucking do it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:48       And that my friends go, I just watched you fold so fucking quick. I was like, well, you said to machine. I mean, how do I not like we're brothers now. You and I both have that same issue too, that your party guys too. We're both chaos people. I mean there's a thousand videos of me is screaming at people on Youtube and and audiences and hecklers and stuff. When I was in Milwaukee, the show, it was a, it was a great audience. Let me just. It was a weird thing and then it got crazy and people yelling things out left and right, but before that there they're laughing and everything. They're like a great crowd. There's just a few crazy drunk knuckleheads and it eventually wound up being like one of these question and answer type things where you know, people, people are yelling things out. I'm talking to them, but people like that and you know what they like about it.

Speaker 4:          01:07:38       They like when they have, they know that you brought these girls out of the audience there onstage with you and you're off in the corner shaving your balls. They know that this is just coming out of nowhere. That's what I know, but it. But it makes it, it makes it like. I almost feel like it's a, it's like shooting heroin, like doing standard smoking, heroin. Then you get someone on stage and you have this real fucking moment where you got three gangbangers dicks out and they're fucking real talk. Mother fucker is the three. Oh five. And you're like, do you have guys had their dicks out on stage? Yeah, I told you that one time. Yeah. Explain that again. What happened? I was in Miami. Miami's my crazy fucking place. I've, I, it just chaos happens in Miami. Yeah. Miami, if you want to starve to death, open up a bookstore in Miami.

Speaker 3:          01:08:24       Fucking jokes are so good. How does that work that you say that? No, you. If you want to start done. It was like, where's he going with this? And then you switch it. My brain starts going, oh, time to giggle. What does, how does that work? It's time to Giggle, but other night. Let's fuck. Let's put it on

Speaker 4:          01:08:42       Carola's reading glasses and see if we can solve this with Adam Carolla here. Yeah, man. I get fucking a-listers here. I've got an issue. My eyes are really bad. He needs reading glasses really bad. But. But like there was this thing where he's like looking at the receipt. Like, what's this say right here? Well, I can't see in low light in the highlight conditions is absolute true and highlight conditions. My, my eyes were great, but in low light conditions have a really hard time reading now. I think it looks great. I think that's going to be your new style. You're going to be one of those guys like random problems. My problem is that my eyes and Adam crawls eyes are in the same state of deterioration. Yeah. I thought it was a big guy. Wow. This is so much better, right? Yeah. You need. It might do. You could just get Oakley a rims and then just tell me what those. Uh, Linda. No, you don't. You don't want to wear them so sad. You've got to get the ones that flip up and fold up like old congressmen have. Yeah, I can read this easily, but not. It's not as clear. My Dad has these glasses. They're magical. They go one side as far sided. One side is normal, so yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       if he ever wants to read something in the 30 some magic, there's a man named Harry Potter and lives in the castle and he solved the problem of vision. The warlock lenscrafters gave it to. I wonder men, the first dude to come up with glasses, man. He must've been a goddamn wizard. Who's the first guy that got girls to swallow? That shit's been going on since the stone age. There's no one who could hold claim to that. There's probably a few charlatans from the 15 hundreds. I was the first. No, no, no, no. The cave man bitches were sucking dicks and swollen loads. Loads contain nutrients. Back then you had to learn hard to stay alive. GNC, you drank your piercing. He swallowed other people's loads. Whatever. You don't like it, but I just want to be healthy. It's tapioca pudding son, Alphacam

Speaker 4:          01:10:43       baby. Oh, Alpha Alpha nails with my Alphacam. So you noticed with those pills, those pills. I, I, you know what, there's a lot of people online that are like crying about it because they will know no one who's known as Tegan is crying about it. Right? Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Guy I met loves it. He don't want to believe that there's something that you can take that can actually enhance brain function. Like this would be like the biggest thing that ever happened. Neuroscience, we're not talking about some limitless pill that you take and all of a sudden you're super genius, but we're talking about is you when you

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       don't. You have moments where you feel at your best. Yeah. Yeah. Did you? But it's at your best. You're not on steroids. You're not on limitless. You not on some craziest, but it's you at your best and those moments are hard to attain and I think they have a lot to do with rest and nutrition. I think you at your best has to do with what your body is processing. What is it? Processing good foods and vegetables and vitamins and everything is smooth and easy. It's got everything. It's required and when you do that, things work

Speaker 2:          01:11:42       better. I started, I started not drinking on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, Friday, Saturday. I blow it out a bit on stage. Definitely not drinking on Thursday. Going up on stage too much. Is that going to bed, getting a good night's sleep, working out Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday workout every single day. Eat healthy at the clubs and then whatever I can get around the club, around the hotel. I did it. I'm grant funding. I did it one weekend but, but, but I felt good. I felt really good and I thought I started thinking, you know, that there is something to that. Because this last weekend in Atlanta, I was on a bender, a drink every morning. I drank every morning on radio. I drank every, every evening on stage. I spent the whole night out all night and then every day like my friends would come down and we'd go drinking or Jesus.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       It was, it was a bender. Didn't drink pedialyte. No. You know what, man, I wonder if I'm dehydrated as fuck. Of course you will. Yeah. Just start drinking fucking a coconut water coconut water right now. Uh, well. Don't want to interrupt my beers. The um, the. Yeah, I started doing that. And then. And then you don't want any drink on flights or drink complains heavily. I drank. I tried to slow down today because I was like drink. It's panic but. And that helps you know, fix it. But I was like, I don't wanna be a mess when I show up at your house and just be like fucking. I was hoping you were going to be a mess. Trust me when I say that. I'm a good mess. I'm a fun math madness. Yeah. There's some people that I would say you're drinking. Um, let's do this tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow. Did, but you're not that guy. Do you know what? My Dad gave me a pony a

Speaker 3:          01:13:30       me softly and show you where to go back to the old family field. Richard Dawson. Did

Speaker 2:          01:13:55       you. You sent me that shit about Andy Dick by the way. What the fuck was going on? Tell me exactly what happened was I was watching it on the plane so I didn't really get the whole thing, but andy was on. Greg Fitzsimmons only said he was a Jew and they off on that, kept going

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       on about hook nose Jew and calling them a hook known to look. Andy is obviously in a tail spin right now. He's in a downward spiral, you know, he keeps getting. He got sober when he was on our show who was sober and then afterwards he got arrested.

Speaker 7:          01:14:27       Did Ab maybe got arrested? I mean maybe he was. Yeah. You don't think he was so. But you think he was cooking up? I don't think. I don't know what he was and I don't want to say he was, but I do know he has the biggest, a urinary track infection I've ever seen. Then because he keeps. He went to the back of my four times. He could've been doing something there. He maybe he did that for confidence. Who's worried about, you know, he had talked to a lot of shit about me and then all of sudden is going to be on a podcast and he also, because he also, the only reason I ever think this is because I noticed that he went to the bathroom four times, but that also that he was saying he was sober, but then people at the comedy store is like, dude, he was blacking out here last year, last night when you told him

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       me that about that, that people did at the comedy store. Psalm all fucked up. You know, Andy and I have a lot of history and uh, I understand Andy in a way that very few people do. And I, I, when I, when I say that I honestly loved the guy and I wish them the best. I honestly do. I really do. And he's a, he's a good person and his best moments, you know, he's just crazy as fuck. And he blames me for a lot of, like his bad times when he was on news radio and he's like, he is so angry. He was so mean to me. He doesn't realize he was constantly pushing my buttons. He was constantly fucking with me and he was doing it because it's just in his nature. He had a, an insane childhood and I don't know the full details, but I know it was not good and you know, because of that he's, you know, become this incredibly talented, gifted, sort of a needy cat. And uh, our, our relationship has always been very strange, you know, like he literally bang on my trailer door, opened it up and he had his dick in his hand,

Speaker 7:          01:16:04       but you do understand. Friend was in the, in the room and he's like, can you guys fuck? And he's like, try, I mean it was fucking serious. But you do understand that even though when he was on the show that might've been like to you, but that was in lot of people's opinions, the best fucking duo ever watching you and gather. It's probably one of the best things I've ever seen in my whole entire life.

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       Interesting. When we did the show and we did the show, we had this weird love hate relationship. Like Andy could make me laugh harder than anybody. Man, when we did scenes together, I would have to redo things like three or four times because I couldn't stop cracking up. I couldn't help myself. We had this one where there was pencils. I had pencils in my hand and one of them was obviously way longer than the other one, which is the longest one is like the attack and it gets in my face and he's like, it's just studying it and I couldn't stop laughing. He's fucking brilliant. Oh

Speaker 7:          01:16:57       Man. I remember falling in love with that show. He's not that guy anymore. He's now he's Andy at 50 or whatever. It is. So sad. What did he say? I mean, what's that look? Here's the root of it. Forget all

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       the words that came out. What's the intention behind it? The intention behind it is to lash out at Howard stern so that Howard stern in turn lashes back and maybe there's room for reconciliation and all this is just giant sums of attention. If it was money, it would be a financial downpour. It's attention. That's what it is, and he probably doesn't even realize it when he's saying it, but Howard starting to do anything to him and he's, you know,

Speaker 7:          01:17:37       what did I mean? Did he owe money? Oh No, no. Howard stern doesn't know a fucking say human.

Speaker 2:          01:17:43       He called him when Charlie Sheen was one the show and wanted to like put his, he just wanted attention when Charlie Sheen was darn electronic, Jane or Charlie Sheen was there and uh, and Howard wouldn't take the call and he said something like, Andy's, you know, why are we going to take listen to him? He's living in a fucking trailer in the back of his house. He is or whatever. And then Andy got upset, lashed out at, at Howard all greg show. And I heard Howard talk about it and I really, it really was like, you know, it almost sounded like Michael Richards when he tried to like, you know, the nigger thing, almost bain, but it's super sad. I don't even want to say it's sad. It's just because I don't want, I wouldn't want to put that energy out there, but it is because man Andy was, was so fucking talented.

Speaker 7:          01:18:32       He still towns, he's just crazy. Some layers. It still cracks me up. I don't care if he's sober. He's still cracks me up. He's not doing good right now. That's what the problem is. If he was doing good, if he was on a sitcom right now and he's making

Speaker 1:          01:18:43       tons of cash and you know, and he could fuck off and then pull it back together again, he'd be okay. The problem is right now he's not on st and he's in. He's in a bad place. It's not good and so he's lashing out with Howard Stern.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       I think the lesson is don't ever tell people you're quitting drinking. Just quote

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       he was he, he did it and then he would say, you know, I'm not saying it's forever.

Speaker 7:          01:19:03       I don't know though. His response, like Howard Stern's response to it. That kind of freaked me out because it's like, dude, why are you going off on, what was it? Thirty minutes, 40 minutes. You immediately snapped and now like this guy that you obviously know it's fucked up, you're fucking destroying him in 30 minutes and like him and robin just like Kinda tore andy apart. Like I was like, you have to understand where Andy is right now. And like, like you pretty much exposed yourself and just saying like, all right, you don't give a shit about this dude. So even if you have some qualms with this guy, you just pretty much just expose yourself as like thinking this guy is the worst person in the room. At least that's what I got from it. I don't understand what you're saying. He just, he just, he, he, he like, he really focused on what Andy said about being a Jew or being like a Jew Hook, nose, Jew or whatever he like. And if you look at old school, Howard Stern, Howard stern was the first person to like make fun of blacks. Make Fun of fucking Italians. Make Fun. Like, like Howard used to be like this risky guy and he focused so much on like being called a Jew, like, like it, like it seemed like the whole thing was because of that, like some anger at. Okay. You know what I'm talking about? Like kind of misordered knowing you're talking about. But honestly

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       when I was hearing that I was the, first of all, I was like, this is so low level. This is such a low level move to ses at Julie's a hook, nose Jew. I was like, come on man, this is like, this is, this is just more on shit. And it's like you're, you're, you're just going after this stuff that he goes after about himself and you're going after it and you're saying he's got a sore spot. They're like, what is this? It's just idiotic because what it is. But his reaction to it, you gotta realize Howard Stern is an old school dude. You know, he's older than us, man. He's been around a long time, pre internet and he grew up in a fucking black community man. So you know, that kind of racist or calling them a Jew, calling them a Jew is. It doesn't feel good man.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       It feels fucking shitty and it feels like something that he has to defend. And when he says that, if anybody, if this guy did this rant about any other ethnicity, if he did this rant about black people, he would be all over the fucking news. People would be talking about let's blackball hamlet's never hire him again because he's running off at the mouth about Jews. Nobody cares. Because the presumption is that Jews run show business anyway. Oh poor, you know, $500. Millionaire, Howard Stern. It gets called a Jew, you know? Oh, you're going to be okay. You know, that's the presumption. You don't know when you really. I agree with Howard though. I think, you know, you got to point it out. If this was, if he was talking to my gaze and he wasn't gay, but he was gay. So if he is gay, wouldn't you know, Andy talked about gays, that they'd be like, whatever, you know what I mean? But he had sort of gay gay style sometimes at times every day being in the podcasts and it him sitting next to me and going, oh, so attracted to you

Speaker 4:          01:21:49       going back. No fucking way. No Way. Never do that. You never. No, no, no. That's it. There's nothing good about killing him with my hands. Fuck. He always scared for you go to jail. There's no follow up to that interview. No, I'm just saying that you thought the interview was really awful. No, no, no, no. It was uncomfortable for me, but I didn't think it was an interesting,

Speaker 1:          01:22:15       very funny. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And he's hilarious. Look, if Andy and I, you know, if this is a true story, this is a true statement. Rather if a sitcom came up and they said we want to do a sitcom with you and andy and we're pretty sure we've got andy under control and Andy is talking to a therapist and he's on this new thing that's called Zoloft, Tinian

Speaker 4:          01:22:35       fucking insights. A lot of Zoloft. And apparently it's totally leveled them out, but he's funnier than ever. And they let her.

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       I smoke pot. He's only allowed to smoke pot. I'd be like, wow, okay. What network?

Speaker 4:          01:22:48       I swear to God, man, I loved working with that guy. But if he said all those things, what about

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       Howard that he said about me? It wouldn't hurt me as much as it hurt Howard or make me as man because I know who he is. I know you can't trick me with a bunch of noise that comes out of your mouth. I know where it all comes from. I know. I know the fiber of his being in these crazy. He's crazy as fuck. You know, and he didn't know what he really means by all this. As he feels abandoned, he's got nothing going on. And so he lashes out and he says fucked up shit like that. But that's really what it is. So when, when Howard got all mad and you know, and, and freaked out about it, I saw his point, but I also saw a point where someone needs to be right next to Howard going, dude, not about this guy, this guy to go over this, get out. Because he was going off about like, you know, number one in the market, have you try going into a market and become number one, why all these comedians on Corolla? Yeah. He was going off about why these comedians are jealous of me. Why know? Why do they say things about me? Look,

Speaker 5:          01:23:45       here's the deal. Like if you walk around my house, man, you'll see lenny bruce all over the place you've been. You've seen these posters that have happened. I don't want to sit around listening to lenny. Bruce. Okay. I don't, I don't. It's not like I listen to them every day, but in my mind, the only way I would've ever gotten to do what I'm doing with my life is if there was some bad mother fucker from the sixties, some crazy Jew named lenny bruce and this motherfucker was such a bad ass and a risk taker. It didn't. He got arrested. They put them in jail for saying certain words. He was a guy who got on stage in front of a bunch of people in a mixed audience and started calling. Where are the niggers were the negatives? Whereas a nigger over here, we've got a Nigga over there.

Speaker 5:          01:24:29       We've got a Nigga over here, we have a Nigga, we gotta, we gotta jude. We got kick. Here's a kite. We gotta go over here. Really? He would. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was with a spic dirty spic right there. That's like, here's a SPEC. Here's a walk. We got New Guinea wop. We've got a Jew, a giddy up. We got two niggas. Are you saying? He said, and he said that he had this whole bit about. If you say that enough, then it's not going to hurt a little kid's feelings. It won't be so shocking. Will take away the power from this stupid word. He was the first guy to use a joke about. There's two jokes that I've heard that people ripped off. They probably didn't even realize they ripped off, but they were lenny bruce jokes. One of them was he goes, being a homosexual is illegal.

Speaker 5:          01:25:10       Dig. So what would happen is when the see someone, they arrest you, they put you in jail, but men want to have sex with you mean we can't. In our. In our context of our society in 2011, our, our level of social evolution, we're far beyond where we were in the sixties, but this guy in the sixties was fucking revolutionary and so that's why I have posters of money, bruises all over my house. If you want to talk about radio, there's only one guy you want to talk about and that's Howard stern and that is a fact. I don't give a fuck what you say. That guy is revolutionary. He's the one guy who stepped in when everybody was doing the same stupid shit and he took chances. He did crazy shit. He, he went deep and dark and it's not because he really means all the things that he's saying he wants to putting

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       on a show, extreme entertainment, extreme and attainment, but in doing so, you put out a lot of you. You take a lot of chances, you expose yourself and you become very sensitive and through all of his attacks, I think he's become more sensitive because I don't think that Howard stern of 10, 15 years ago would have reacted the way he reacted to any deck. Now I think he would mock Andy Dick because I think, I don't want to say he was correcting who is incorrect, but if Andy says something about me like that, I would have it on and I would start laughing and say I need to call

Speaker 4:          01:26:36       Dick. Well, life counselor was thinking, what do I need to do to get my life in order? Well, I'm a hook. No Jew is fix the sandy. You know, like, what the fuck are you trying to say? Not only that, here's a guy living in a shed who's giving this advice out, which just makes it even more ironic. That's marriage. Do you think that's him? Him and Howard death.

Speaker 1:          01:26:55       Who the fuck do I know? I'm not wanting to come. I don't know him that well. If I knew him that well, it do a show more often. I don't know him that well. She's older. Yeah. Once you get older, you're going to extreme human being, man. He's an extreme example of what's possible. There's in any sport, man, you know, but it's, oh Michael Jordan's a douche bag. But you know what, Michael Jordan can dunk from fucking half court, so shut the fuck up here. We don't know why that guy's a Douche bag and I'm not. I'm not giving him a free pass. I'm not giving anyone a free pass, but excellent examples of human beings in any form that doesn't. They don't come balanced. Okay? For someone to reach the highest heights and set the standards in a way that have not been set before, whether it's through comedy or music or radio or anything, that person, that fucking purse, that pioneer way at the front of the line, running through barriers, that guy's not going to be balanced because if it was balanced, you wouldn't have the energy to get there.

Speaker 1:          01:27:49       The way you have the energy to get there is that you are imbalanced. So you've got to respect that man. You know, and then you have to grade things on a curve and you should judge people based on their accomplishments almost as much as you judge them based on their personality to personality is what's most important. If you want to be around them for sure you know, you don't want someone to around you that wants to be the king of the world and once you know all the conversations to be about him, but he got to realize that in order to start some giant mega corporation in order to, you know, to be the guy at the head of Halliburton when you really have to be that guy. There's this, it's not possible without.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       You can't, it's not, not as. You can't just, I, you know, I say that sometimes about nine. None of this is really downplaying it, but about standup in order to want to stand in front of a group of strangers for an hour and speak something fucked up with you. Dude. I say it on stage. I do a whole bit about it. How ridiculous it is that here I am, I'm saying, well, I want a job where I'm the only one who gets to talk for an hour in front of a bunch of people. You're right there. You're right there. This is not like the Internet. Like right now we've isolated this situation where there's only three of us in my office and we're hanging out talking, but when you're on stage, man, I'll do that shit in front of a thousand people, 2000 people, even there's 2000 people in the audience. I'm talking and they don't give a shit.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       The weirdest scenario in the world is my friends. I went out with a bunch of friends. All my friends are single and Atlanta. Single and fucking rich as fuck. Like these criminals. Do. They know they own bars. Like my one buddy owns a bunch of bars called Tin Lizzy's because they owned bars. They're all just wealthy. They're just single guys who have nothing but disposable income, but what are there? The reason why I'm asking that because the reason why they're single. A lot of people in the bar business or fucking single. Yeah, I know. I think he got into the bar business because he's single not. You know what I mean? I don't think has any. I don't think there's any. He wanted to make money, but he also was like, fuck, it's a great way to meet chicks. He opened like one of the biggest parts of Atlanta back in like, like when email just started, he owned a bar and he got everyone's email addresses and so now he's locked down Atlanta. There was a dude who wrote a post on the underground forum about

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       this chick that he dated that was in a bar. She was so she worked in a, as a waitress in a bar and that over the years he watched her change over the years of being in that environment and constantly being around party pitbulls and constantly being around the light and the nightlife that he watched her change and I'm like, man, that is got to be one of the most depressing things in the world. Do you being in love with a chick, you're living with her and watching her change because she's around all these rich guys that are trying to stick their dick under her. So every night they're dancing. The Devil's dance. They got fucking fired, redness, a Ferrari, and after a while there, even though she loves her man, there is a real resentment that builds up. Why can't the man that I love provided me with the Ferrari?

Speaker 1:          01:30:35       Why can't the man that I love giving me this House that this guy could give me if I just took that evil Dick, that dirty, scaly, scratchy for covered cock, like a little wolverine. Dick's, Dick's inside of just a monster man, some fucking horrible person that just wants to get money and money and money dancing the dance, and every night she sees these guys dancing, dance, throwing thousand dollars, tips her way and she didn't. Come on baby. Any night I'll take you away from this. You don't look at it. I'm looking at settle down. I'm looking to get out of this game. Private jets. I'm looking to get out of this game. Yeah man. This dudes that will show up at nightclubs especially, you know Miami. Miami's a Goddamn joke. This dude's flying in on private planes from all over the world. Just to be a baller in Miami. There's a few spots in the world where it's like, it's a clutch move to show up and be a baller, you know, where people will fly in the super elite, ultra billionaire type characters that, you know, we'll fly in during conn and France.

Speaker 2:          01:31:39       I want to be, don't, don't you kind of want to try it once, but like just be, I want to be the guy that rolls in on a private jet. Like I was with my friends and I was watching them. They're all, they're all, they're all fucking liquid. No kids, no nothing. No. Don't worry about anything and end this whole time I'm a news stand up. They've been spitting game of bitches. So this, this

Speaker 4:          01:32:01       gentleman known as the urban influence. Whole time I've been doing this comedy thing. They've been spitting game at bitches. They're game is soul time. You got married and had this whole time. So like we all went out to the. One of my buddies bars and Mike and I watched them operate with women in watching a pro on stage. Yeah. But do you know what dude? That's all nonsense. You know they have card tricks. You're Bert Kreischer. You're a fucking comedian. You know what I'm saying? Do you understand that they can't be jealous and these guys are good at bullshitting. They have to bullshit. All you have to do is go, ladies, I'm onstage. Where's the shot's cut? Two or three hours later, you hotel room, one girl locked onto your balls like one of those land in the bottom of a shark and the other ones suck it on your shaft and you squirt while you throw your arms up in the air and victory right here.

Speaker 4:          01:32:54       One of the girls go, powerful burt Chrysler, Chrysler. Yeah, exactly. Fuck your friends in their bars. You're Bert Kreischer. If you were single dude, you'd be doing damage right now, son. You would be doing. Oh, you didn't have the little babies and the wife and the whole, the whole package. And he went out there and like the whole pack. Look, I love the whole package so people don't believe that I. You know, you don't think that you would, but you do. It's like being. It's like, it's like almost like being an alcoholic or a Christian, but you can only connect. Like I tried to tell my friends like how great it is and they just don't see this guy. I'm, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. It's not for everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:33:31       You know? I, I used to hate when people who had kids would say that the only way to live a fulfilled life is to have children, but I think that's preposterous and I still do.

Speaker 4:          01:33:41       Do you believe it's the only way to fucking. I haven't touched this one here. Take this one. It's not the only way. It's ridiculous. Why don't you just suck on that before it spills all over my goddamn table. Son. You got to. You're on your own iphone. Their fellow. No, this is yours. I think crusher. Sloppy drunk. No, I just, um, you know what's so funny is my iphone. You Fuck? Igor taught me how to. What's a foreign bottle like that? What's a fun off the side? That's where you going to tell me no ego. I told you that last week. Didn't the side of the table. No beer bottle of beer bottle robin to get a Napkin. Oh, don't worry about it dude. Okay, grab that towel off

Speaker 1:          01:34:22       the wall. Grab the towel. Just don't lose the blue angels photo. That shit's important man. Best wishes from the blue angels. February 22nd, 1999. Folks. I flew in an f 18, seven and a half g's. I had a whole bit about it. I did. And one of my specials back in the design was true, man. I was incredible. You realize how fast those fucking things go. You can't even wrap your head around it, man. Who we were. Um, and these guys were started. Man. These fucking dudes. Who are these, these fighter pilots. I can't be over a certain height because you have to, uh, maximize the amount of g force you can take. You should be short. So you can do that. The hooking thing where you hold onto the thing or just what the fuck that what you're doing is as you're hitting that, Geez, you're doing what's called hooking and you're holding onto the handle and to go on this and what you're doing is forcing blood into your brain because the pressure of the g force is literally pushing the blood out of your brain.

Speaker 2:          01:35:25       I think that would make me black out.

Speaker 1:          01:35:27       It course it was. That's it does make you. But will that keeps you alive under, under normal conditions. Maybe that would make you black enough. I don't think it will, but the, the, the pressure is with trying to get you to blackout and the hooking is what makes you stay alive. And uh, we were um, we were flying in his fucking fat and we did some crazy drills. Man, were we, one time we hit, we went to, we went to five and he goes, you cool with five? I can handle five and went to six. You know, you're cool with sex. I go, I did it. I did. I did it. He's like, Oh, I'm going to take this up. I'm gonna take this out, and we went to seven and a half g's, but he was hooking to. That's what it was freaky to. He was going through this. Then you could. You could see consciousness like an elevator door. You could see there was darkness on either side

Speaker 2:          01:36:12       side. Getting choked out. Yeah, exactly. He's choked me out. That fucking freaked me out. You watch it go close and then it's almost like you're dancing. You're head's on the. You're. You're buried. Your body's buried your head bay and you're dancing. There's a whole world underneath you to stairs that go down and then you got them back up and you're like, Hey, what happened?

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       Well, you get a little tiny dose of psychedelic is what happens when you get choked out. You have little dreams. Have Weird things. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       Have you ever been choked out? No. Check yourself. Never been choked. Unconscious Joe. No. Never told me to do it too. You know, I've done it lot. It's a tap. I'm not stupid. I know when I'm going out, when I'm going out, I just tapped. But it could happen. It could happen tonight. I'm going to class tonight. I get choked unconscious tonight and happens all the time. Oh Man. He ain't get choked out or. Yeah, let's. Yeah, let's do that. You should do Jujitsu, man. I've been thinking about it. Fuck yeah man. A lot of my head of one of my friends who got the the laughing skull and Atlanta's is massively into Jujitsu and he's like, you know, it calms me down a, a lot of energy and angry energy. And he goes, the other day a guy got really pissed about his bar tab at the club and he got my face and he's like, I just didn't like.

Speaker 2:          01:37:19       There was no anger towards him. I was just like, listen man, we're fine. You know, like he, he's like, it centered me. I've been thinking about it. My problem is I'm not around anywhere. I don't know it on the road. I'd be, I'd be at the brand new. I'd be the fucking punching bag. Every. Yeah. Every day. Yeah. It's good for you. Good for you to get your ass kicked. Really? Yeah. It's good for you to know how easy it is for man. Kick your ass to eyes, good for you, good for you to get destroyed, as good for you to get mounted.

Speaker 1:          01:37:46       Triangle choked and shit. It's good because you realize how easy it is for someone to do that to you because most people have no idea they walked through this world. Having no idea how

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       summer Marcello Garcia character could just fucking take your life anytime he wanted to and not just take your life. How about this? How about taking my life? What I've been doing Jujitsu, for instance, 96 and that little dude from Brazil get struggled the fuck out of me one day he wants and that's a reality and I'm almost a black belt. I'm like high level and there's a lot of people have choked out. I can choke out some good people, man, and that guy could just tap me anytime he wants. So for me to be like almost a black belt, I might as well have never done Jujitsu. I'll just be able to hold them off for a little is gonna get me. It's inevitable that that's the kind of reality that exists for most people. If you know Jujitsu for most people, if you're in some sort of a street altercation with someone and you get a hold of them, that's why you have to do so.

Speaker 5:          01:38:39       I have to do hang on because you know what? In class in class, you're going 100 percent, 100 percent. Yeah. You know why? Because you don't hit each other. You're trying to choke and grappling and grappling. You're allowed to go 100 percent. Doesn't mean you heard it. Your, your partners. If you have a lock, if you have a choke you, you put it to a certain position and you can just hold it and let it go, but the point is it takes 100 percent of your effort to get to that position and that's exactly what's going to come up in a fight and a fight. It's going to be 100 percent effort except you're used to doing 100 percent effort three, four nights a week, three, four nights a week. I go in, there's grown men and they're going to try to kill me with their bare hands and I'm going to try to kill them and then we're going to slap hands and we hugged and I said, thanks brother, and we move onto the next guy and you go to the next one. The next one, he's tap hands you. You go at your slap hands and said, everybody does and any lockup and this is the goal. I'm going to try to get you to tap and what you're saying when you tap is you could have just killed me and then you're gonna. Try to do the same thing to me and if you get me, it's something I'm going to have to tap and I'm not going to want to, but I'm going to have to because very important. You don't want to die.

Speaker 2:          01:39:38       I thought opportunity right there, just do it. Hence Hensville. Henzel gracie. Benzos told me he was like, come on out to the the place and I will see, will teach you Jujitsu. Sure. Why don't you do it. I was like, I know. After I did the thing I said that was really cool. I felt really grounded when I got dunks. I got beaten up a couple times and once you get your ass beat, but you know it's not. There's no malice and you don't have to go home to your little sister and she looks at you and goes what happened? And you're like, like

Speaker 5:          01:40:07       it's a game. And the game is using your body to dominate another person's body with technique and leverage.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       I want to do it. I want to do it because there I have so many anxieties of just k. it's the reason I want to get a fucking massive dog. It's the reason I want to fucking live in Montana. The reason I want to buy a shotgun, every. Everything. I'm in Iowa, it's like I just, the reason I drink on planes, it's, I just, I'm afraid like, like you're afraid of a fight on a plane. Uh, today. Yeah. Fucking guy.

Speaker 5:          01:40:39       How many, by the way before we get started, how many fucking fight stories I've ever been started by this fucking thing?

Speaker 2:          01:40:44       Got that statement. So fucking things that like what you got in a fight to fucking guy like that statement. This fucking guy is probably number one. All time. Maybe the most appearances ever. Fox Story. Start this fucking guy. This guy had his jumpsuit on. He had two jackets on, right? So I'm watching him and then, uh, and he kept going to the bathroom. He went to the bathroom like five times while I went. Once I kept watching him, I was like, what the fuck she doing in the bathroom? So then I go in and after it goes in, like the fifth time I go into and it smells like Bengay, like really fucking, like really, uh, intense and I go and then I'd watch them going like five more times. And the one time he goes to the bathroom, I just walk up and I look at him and I go, what are you doing in the bathroom?

Speaker 2:          01:41:39       And the guy was like, so you're on top of this guy's bathroom shit. Fuck you. Where you like, you think you're a cop of deodorant? I don't. You know what? Here's the thing is I don't, I don't know what he thought I was. It wasn't deodorant. I realized, I think I realized what it was. I think he was smoking something a cigarette or those or the fake cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes cause it, it smelled like, like menthol in the back of exactly what he's figured it out. But when I said, what are you doing in there? He. He was like, oh no, no, I'm gonna go to the bathroom and went okay. But I didn't want. I didn't know if he knew who I was, but I was thinking if I could have fucking fight this guy. I was like, how's this going down? He might've thought that you were like, oh, martial arts. Exactly what I was thinking. I was like, I don't want them to think anything because I'm like the least suspecting Air Marshall. I just want him to know. He told me.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       He just gave us crazy eyes, but he told me he wants to go and then I realized he was smoking one of those cigarettes in there probably it was sketches of sketchy and he had like, and here's what the way my crazy brain thinks is he had those eyepatch patches that you put on to sleep on a plane. He had those like on his head, like a pair of sunglasses like up here. And I was like, in my head I start going crazy and I'm like, he's a, he's a fucking, it's a plant. He's got those because they told him and terrorists class who make it look like you're going to take a nap. Like, no, this guy get the neck thing. Oh, I'm not going to blow up the plane. So I just kept walking. So you're really paranoid enough to think that people are.

Speaker 2:          01:43:06       You're watching people's bathroom behavior or something. Have you ever thought it's just like knocking yourself out and sleeping the whole time. Like that's what I wanted them to take the laptop to watch a movie on your account. I definitely listened to the podcast with you and a Ra. Do you write on planes over? Who are you? That guy that stands up in the middle of the island. It looks at everybody acts like they're getting something out of the front, but then you're just checking everybody out like, no, no, this today was a special occasion. I know. Normally freak out on planes. Today was a special occasion because he was going to the bathroom so much. I went, something's going on the fucking bathroom. Like I was just in my head. I was like, he's fucking dude. There's something going on in the bathroom and I'm the only person that noticing.

Speaker 2:          01:43:43       He went to the. When he was smoking a cigarette, that's what he was doing. He was smoking with a cigarette. Can you can't ride on a plane? You said? No, because I'm. I'm a fucking mess. I can't. I want. If you're listening to this and you can fucking fix my flying, you fucking do it. I hate it. I hate that. I. I can't listen to your podcast when you do them on planes. Really fucking give me a call. I have another one I have to give you. We did a 20 minute when me and Joey, so there's a bonus bonus footage coming ladies, Joan, but I can't. I can't listen to them. Like even just gives me anxiety. You guys give me anxiety. I don't know man. I wish I could figure it out because we're on a plane and you're going to put all this sudden. I'm telling them no, no, no. If I want to play, I'll never fucking listen to that one. Want to noise reduction? Apple plain bucket.

Speaker 2:          01:44:25       Eavesdropping on you and Tom Behind me. Now he can't even listen to you on a plane at home. Like if I can't listen to it, it gives me anxiety. Wow. When you're at home and you listen to our podcast on the planet, me, anxiety me. Am I the first guy to do podcasts? And I'm playing. That'd be awesome. If I were you molested by a plane as a young child. No question. My first lesson on my first plane trip ever, my dad is uh, my, my dad is a great man, but he was not prepared to have you say my dad is a great man, but soft things, there's a list of them things that he, uh, that he did did as a parent that maybe I wouldn't have done. Like number one. Like I remember when I was in first grade, I came home, I was real problems.

Speaker 2:          01:45:08       Like Dad, I'm the fastest kid in my class. And he was like, well, you're not faster than me. I was like, Dad, I'm pretty fucking fast. I didn't say fuck, but I was like, I'm pretty fast. And he was like, really? I was like, yeah. He goes, let's go outside and race. I said, alright. So we got outside, I pull my knee socks up to my knees, I get my little startup position that almost went to the Olympics for track. So we go and he's like on your mark, get set, go and I take off and I got the lead and all of a sudden he blows by me and he's running backwards. He's like, looks at me, and he goes, you'll never beat me at anything like fucking first grade dad. So when I took my, I took a plane flight to Pennsylvania. I remember, uh, the catcher for the, uh, for the Yankees, uh, was named, um, Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:45:50       It's escaping me, but he died in a plane crash and I remember saying to them, a god, I can't believe he. He died in a plane crash. And my dad goes, yeah, like, what was it, like a special plane flight? I was a kid and taking my first plane flight. And he goes, nope. Sometimes planes go down. And I was like, like the one I go on. And he goes, yeah, let's go. They go down. I was like, Oh fuck. And then I got on the plane and we started taking off and I looked at my, my dad was on the plane with me and my mom and my sister were taken off. I remember looking at my mom growing, we're high enough right now, I don't want to this. And then he kept going and go, stop going higher. I start yelling. How old were you?

Speaker 2:          01:46:23       Like fucking probably, I want to say first grade, first grade. I had like a number of traumatic things. I watched the dude light himself on fire. Yeah. Fuck yes. This kid John, my end with the crazy part of this is my uncle John was staying with us. This kid John took me and corky gains down the street. It was like a redneck neighborhood. And he goes, uh, you guys want to see a magic trick? And we're like, hey. So he goes, watch this. So he dips a leaf in a, in a, uh, in a butter jar, butter tub of solution and then light sitting in lights on fire. The butter thing is obviously gasoline going like, wow, that's amazing. And he was, I can do it again. And so he did it again when I go and he goes, watch this. And He poured a little bit and he lit it and then the thing exploded and they caught him on fire and he went like, so I go taking off, running to my house and I run into my house screaming. John's on fire. John's on fire. My uncle John is sleeping on the couch thinking he's on fire. He's like pissed all over the couch, but I saw that happen and it fucking traumatized me. What happened to the kid? Quirky gains. Oh, quirky games rolled in dog shit like two days later. But John John, he has pants. My mom came down and my mom was like,

Speaker 4:          01:47:34       okay. And he was like two days late. It seems like crazy by the way. Crazy right now is drunk. No, I'm not drunk. I'm stone. So many drinks. Have you had your not stone sober? You've had at least three beers. Three Beers. Joe, do you think your stone sober? I Bet I could do a field sobriety test. Oh, field sobriety. You blow into a breathalyzer sign. You're got to be locked up in the pokey government. Drunk is little bit different things. Your government drunk. Well, let's. Okay, let's be fair right now. We're all. Jeremiah started drinking

Speaker 2:          01:48:05       at eight in the morning. Cal earn or east coast?

Speaker 4:          01:48:09       Yeah. We just won the moment. You talked about that other dude, Roland and dog shit. Oh, I thought you were asking what? I'm going to coordinate gains. So you saw a guy get lit on fire, but nothing happened to him. He's his pants. His pants were on fire. My mom, that's it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:24       Are you kidding? He's like, yeah, yeah. He was crying. He was like, I'm fine. I'm upon nothing happened. Don't tell my mom, and then we just went home. I never really hung out with that kid ever again. Wow. I had a bunch

Speaker 4:          01:48:33       of traumatic shit. Dude, that ain't that big a deal, but do you ever look at got lit on fire and didn't even get hurt? Fuck that guy guys to enroll you into a judo class. Now that I'm saying that I'm hearing what I'm saying, real hardships in childhood. I saw my dad beat the fuck out of my mother because she brought home hamburger. Are you serious? Beat the fuck out of her. Does that ever creep up in your foster with an open hand? Is Palm strike during the face? Knocked her down. Blood was coming out of her nose. Screamed at, or do you ever buy extra hamburger when you're at the store? Because it never stopped me from enjoying the hamburgers. I didn't allow it to. I fought through it, but that's nothing. No, I just had a Douche bag for a dad. That's nothing. You know, there's people that have had real shit happened to them. A few real things happening. That was nothing that got lit his pants on fire a little posy. My Shit's not real. Now that you tell your story, not the worst thing, you just need more dramatic shift in your life to think about. So you wouldn't think about little shit. No lifting. Where a martial art

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       comes into place, martial arts is so difficult and so hard to do and you get nervous before every class that it literally allows you to look at other things as like their minor. Now you control these. They're nothing. They're not that big a deal. Like a lot of people, they break a bone or something like that and it's like a really traumatic thing. I haven't had like a gang of surgeries do it. I've had my nose fixed. Both my knees fixed. It's, I've got a lot of shit done, you know, because things are always breaking because you're getting them Yankton, twisted and torked and but because you get used to that, you have a higher threshold for uncomfort, a higher threshold for, for dealing with traumatic situation.

Speaker 2:          01:50:26       So you think ultimately if I started getting into Jujitsu, my fear of flying would disappear. Yes, because I would be feeling fear of flying is your fear of everything

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       got connected and your fear of getting mounted by another man. We tried to choke you unconscious. You're going to get past that. As you get past that, you'll get better at this whole flying thing too. That's what I believe. It's a vehicle. All martial arts are vehicles for your human potential. If you're not trying to be a professional fighter, they're trying to advance your human potential. I mean, it's nice to have something to defend yourself, but just get rich and hires and bodyguards if that's all you're looking for, you know, but, but per personal sovereignty for your ability to be able to push your body to a certain limit past that, limit past the limit of what you thought you were capable of, that's all shit as you chug

Speaker 2:          01:51:12       the capable of that. But if you ever look at the ratio of people that died in plane accidents, like car, I don't have a fucking plan look ratio. People that jump out of planes and die is so uncomfortably I, oh, it's like 70 people a year. There's only a few people like really high. And that was fucking panic. Did you get to touch Rachel? Rachel Ray, right? You get to touch her boobs on the way down or anything. I fucking freaked her out.

Speaker 1:          01:51:40       Imagine if you died and at the moment you die. The moment you both, neither one of your parachute's hit the ground or neither one of your parachute's expand. You both hit the ground screaming and as on impact, you immediately burst into another dimension both completely naked, floating in space and you're banging Rachel Ray. Yeah. From behind that, and then it's pure ecstasy. It's like you're on ecstasy and Viagra and and and almost pot to maybe even mushrooms and your banging Rachel Ray floating through space way. He imagined that that's what death.

Speaker 2:          01:52:15       I would love to Bang Rachael Ray and heaven and you're like, and you're like, God dammit. I was scared of this. I was scared of this. I Love Rachel Ray. Oh, I see what you're saying. As you hit the ground is awesome. Hot on the network. That's a great rate statement. When you said, Oh, I see what you're saying. The fuck you did. Russian Shaker network. That's really sexy. Which is that her name? Her. So sorry. Hot. So I walked up. I, we were in A. I'm in the admiral's Club at, at lax and I see her and she works for food network and that's like how he throws it in there or not. I was at lax and I saw he was in the admiral's club, was the first class lounge I was flying to do letterman and I saw her and now we're both, uh, owned by scripts, both our networks and so I said that I see her but I've been drinking because I'm about to fly and I just, and our flights being delayed and everyone's kind of sitting around and I just looked at her and I go, um, we're owned by the same people.

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       She has no idea who the fuck I am. I'm just saying we're owned by the same people. And she said, excuse me. I'm like, I go like, look at it. I go on Bertha car,

Speaker 3:          01:53:39       no, my birthday because I'm drunk and I'm trying to relate to God. Give me one of those. She goes,

Speaker 2:          01:53:56       she goes, I'm sorry. And I go, I go, I'm on travel channel. I'm on travel channel. And she goes, yeah, and then. And she, yeah. She's like, are you? Yeah, I'm on travel channel. Did you're on food network? She goes, what do you mean? I go script scripts onto both of us. She goes, they don't own me, and I was like, no, I meant like they own our networks and we're on the. I got, my name's Bert. I'm sorry I should have started this differently. She goes, okay. I just walked away and then our plane got delayed and she drove home. She drove home or playing out the lady and she fucking drove home and uh, and did not fly with me. Wow. That sucks. Rachel Ray. No know ray. That was the original. Raised my, my girl. We're going to Mexico in September. If you were single, Rachel Ray was finger, would you try to fuck her?

Speaker 2:          01:54:43       She just nodded. Rachel's to podcasts. It's mostly primarily audio. So that's a little extra treat for the youth stream viewers. Rachel is, I will say this, I will say this candidly, she's married, I'm married and I don't think there's any sexual attraction that she has towards me. I'm, I'll put that out there. But man, she's so sexy. Like there's something very powerful about her, like she just handles herself with so much, like, like, like, uh, like initiative, like the way she talks to you keep popping those beers. I've been while you're talking, she's just, she's just, she's awesome. I have, I have a great time with her. Just makes me giggle and I fucking, I love her. I think she's hot. She's hot. Yeah. I like that. I would like rate and take her on a date and never spending more than 40 bucks, 30 minutes fucking home run. But she's achieved on those websites. Are you serious? Well, you're on the website on another one, but I came on in defending myself. Wait, what did they say about

Speaker 7:          01:55:44       you?

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Oh, it wasn't even me. It was actually a friend of mine and it was in Providence, Rhode Island. The, the, uh, the cameramen were, uh, in town and this lady was really retarded.

Speaker 7:          01:55:53       You're the guy from survivor.

Speaker 1:          01:55:55       I said, no, no, no, no. I'm kind of, I'm the guy from fear factor. She goes, oh, okay. Like, disappointed. Like I said, something wrong or I corrected her, upset at me that I corrected her and like it was, it was real weird and she came up to me and she wanted to take a picture of the membership. Terrible stinky breath and I, I agreed to take a picture of it. Okay. Thank you. Nice to meet you. And I said, nice to meet you and that's it. I left and then she wrote some whole thing about me being a shitty temper and that was really, really rude. Was Not even true. I didn't even buy anything.

Speaker 7:          01:56:24       Came in. They were already there. I just came in and sat down and by the way, forever by the law,

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       be as generous as humanly possible.

Speaker 7:          01:56:31       Sometimes he tips. I'm like, Joe, I, I, you know, understand that that's like your bills. $20. And he just tipped 100. That's ridiculous. Yeah. But I

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       love it. They feel good. You know, if someone's waiting on you and they get that, it's okay.

Speaker 7:          01:56:44       Wait tables where you start going out to eat and go, hey, can I just wait my question? Nick Lodge, do you feel obliged? Because, uh, because you would, it's safe to say that all your friends, uh, don't make as much money as you. Do you feel obliged that you have to pick up the tip, the tab every time?

Speaker 1:          01:57:03       I do have most of the time because the way I say it is, you know, you can get into this who deserves it or you know, who's is it fair or what is money to you could, what's a dollar to you? It was $5 to you, you know, when I was doing like fear factor, especially money became very strange. You know, it becomes very strange when you have a lot of it, you know, because then it's like, why would you look if you pay $5 for your meal, then you have to think, okay, now I have 20 bucks left for the day. If I'm paying $5 for a meal, I don't think about it at all, so let's just let me pay for it. And then that way we don't have to think about it. And it's like the best allocation of resources is how I looked at it. It's the way I looked at as like I'll pay for the tab every time simply because it's easy for me to pay the tab. Like it doesn't bother me at all. Like if there's $100 missing from my account or not, it's not gonna hurt me. It's not gonna change the way I feel.

Speaker 7:          01:57:54       Yeah. But you know, it sucks being friends with joe is that, that gets to. I mean the first in six months I knew Joe, I always felt like I was like, no, no, here's $20. But then I gave up on that. You just have to give up. But then I'll find myself like feeling bad about it, like all the time. So it'd be like at starbucks? No, no, let me get this coffee. No, no, no, no. Seriously, like it does drive me crazy because I feel like, uh, I mean every time you go out to eat especially were on the road, it's just like you're always picking up the bill. It makes me almost not want to eat like normal. Like normally I would go to like a restaurant, be like, all right, I want the steak, I want an appetizer, but then when I'm like, all right, Joe's going to take that so silly. It's so silly. Whatever the fuck you want to eat, I know, but it still gets to you after.

Speaker 1:          01:58:39       He's a strange thing. You know? It's, it's real strange when it becomes a like a dividing thing between people and it can really easily where people don't feel like you're doing your part or they're paying too much or I think probably more fights between human beings or financial more than anything just excite you at all. Excite me. I like having it because it takes care of problems. The good thing about money is you can need things or want things or you know, want free time or money takes care. All that shit. If you. If you have to fix your roof, you got a hole in your roof. Oh Shit. Well when you have money, it's just a matter of calling a roof guy and having them come over and fix your roof. When you don't have money, it becomes very stressful and it's a fucking nightmare. You think, man, I'm barely paying my rent. How am I going to come up with the extra two grand to fix this roof? You know, it becomes a real issue. I like having it because of that, but I'm not like, not big on. I'm not a flashy person and I'm not. I like cars. That's about it, but I don't, you know, I'm not in a showy person. Some people get really addicted to like keeping up with the Joneses and that becomes, that becomes a real problem.

Speaker 2:          01:59:48       We're not, but it's my, my wife grew up in a trailer so we're not the family.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       Yeah. But you could get that way when you get really rich, you know, if this birth to conquer goes into seasons 16 and you know, the fucking travel channel has you and they're big. You're big giant fucking face on the corner of like advertisements in a birth to conquer entering the [inaudible] 16 season and then all of a sudden you're living in Beverly Hills.

Speaker 2:          02:00:10       Oh, I'm already fucking fucked up. I'm fine. Oh yeah. In what way? I'm fucked up in the whole, like the prospect of fame, I mean fame, fame, and I'm definitely not famous, but like, man, I don't even want to say this because it's like telling a secret about your soul. So, okay, just don't judge me. Just hear me as a friend. So I'm with my friends and uh, this, I feel dirty even saying this. So I'm with my friends who are all, have a ton of money. Not that that matters, but they're all in great shape. They're all in the driving range rovers and they own bars and respite and mad came and gave. My buddy has a best pickup line. He goes up to this hot groaning goes, who does everyone tell you you look like? And she's like, Gwenyth paltrow. And he was like, I was gonna say missy Elliott. And he walks away, right? Girls like, fucking all over his shit. Just insulting or right. Anyway. Anyway. Anyway, anyway, Douche bag guy, you guys said it's good.

Speaker 1:          02:01:11       And those lines like that, that's a substitute for personnel.

Speaker 2:          02:01:14       So anyway, so if I was a chicken, hate your friend. Okay. So anyway, a bunch of hot chicks were like rolling up around us and, and, and they're, and they're like, and everyone's having a good time and in my head because I'm this fucking father of two who's just sitting there, I hear my brain go, um, I hope someone recognizes us. Like I hope I get recognized. Like really? Yeah, because I might in a weird way, my ego's fucked up because I know that the girls for no,

Speaker 1:          02:01:43       so no one is banging you. You're going home alone. So like the only satisfaction you can get out of this is one of the girls going, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          02:01:50       Exactly. So I catch myself doing that and I go, oh, what the fuck is that? Did you ask them to listen to the podcast? So I didn't understand a thing. And then I'm sitting there and heard the machine and I'm watching and I'm, and everything's going down and I go, this is, this is unhealthy behavior right now. What's going on is unhealthy. And then as soon as I said, this girl comes up and goes, I got to get a picture with you. And then my, I'm like, okay, I'm done, I don't need to fuck anyone tonight. I'm done. I got recognized like it's, Oh, it's, yeah, but that. But that is, it's, it's addictive. This shit, the, the, the idea of getting recognized or being acknowledged for your work is so self gratifying. It's like, it's almost like masturbating. It's, it feels good and it's shallow, it's so fucking empty. Shallow. But in a weird way I can totally see how people get fucked up on it. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:02:41       shallow and maybe what you do is get pete, that's, it's been a long time. And uh, it's been a normal thing for me to get recognized for more than a decade. So since fear factor was to get, you know, look, the way I always say it is, it's a bunch of people being nice to you. That's what it is. People go, does it ever get annoying? Does it ever get tired? It's just a bunch of people being nice to you. It's cool. But I think it's very important to not understand where it was, you know, the chain. It's addictive. It feels good. It's very important to like put it all into perspective, you know, and it's good to be recognized for your stuff and it's good to do good stuff that people like, you know, the beautiful thing about seeing, you know, you, you run into someone out in public is most of the time they're going to enjoy what you've done. You know, most of the time if someone comes up to you, it's like they appreciate what you've done. And so you've given them something already and you already, you really, even though you don't even know it, you have a relationship with this person.

Speaker 2:          02:03:40       Yeah. No, no, no, no. Okay. No, in all fairness. Uh, so, but how did it feel when Bourdain, who you, who you're a fan of comes up to you and is like, I'd love to do your project,

Speaker 1:          02:03:52       one of sitting next to each other, just completely randomly really at a, at a restaurant in Vegas. Oh, seriously, totally. Seriously. I literally, he was as close as you are to me. So I sat down and he reached up and he said, hey, you know, uh, I, I keep getting asked to things in life, one to go fuck myself and to, to do your podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:04:12       Are you serious? Yeah, that's what I said now. Okay. Be Honest. So your heart flutter totally same shit. I think that's the same shit ultimately. So. So. Oh God, I'm obsessed with bordain.

Speaker 1:          02:04:27       Yeah, he's a great guy. Yeah. I enjoyed talking to him and he actually came to my show at the, uh, the Mandalay Bay theater and I was really any tweeted how funny it was. He was like, I mean, I, I love to this tweet. It said saw Joe Rogan dive. Very, very funny. You know, I said we're going to have great things to talk about in the podcast, like interests and stuff. That's what you said in the tweet. And I remember reading that going, wow, I feel like I live in some sort of a fucking fantasy land. Some sort of a strange world that's not real. Fuck Dane,

Speaker 4:          02:04:53       man, I enjoy that guy. He does not. He does not. He's not. He would not tweet something he didn't feel and, and, and he is a judge. He's not a guy that if he didn't think it was funny, he would have never tweeted it. And the fact that getting like three various holy Fuck Vegas

Speaker 1:          02:05:11       man in Vegas during the night before the UFC and it was me, Joey Diaz.

Speaker 4:          02:05:16       Hey, who else did you get to meet? Joey does. Doug Benson.

Speaker 1:          02:05:19       George sucralose was there and I just, yeah, Joey Diaz went out and crushed it. We just let it fly. Those, those fucking Vegas shows are fun as shit man. When that place fills up and that, that Mandalay Bay theaters like 1600 people, it's huge. It's fucking awesome to man. And so bordain being the audience was like, it was really weird because I'm getting, I'm, I'm used to being around like, you know, Chuck Liddell and Rashad Evans and fucking Leo Machida and Bj Penn and like some of the best fighters in the world where a lot of people would freak, you know, I see them like pj, what's up? You know, it's like they're my friends, you know? To me it's like normal. It's like meeting meeting you, but you know, for me to be around and do like Anthony Bourdain, it's like this is a different world. He's a guy from the show

Speaker 4:          02:06:04       problems, lb side first world problems. First world problems is when he talks about veganism,

Speaker 1:          02:06:12       vegans and vegetarian and he's like, this is a first world option, you know, and that's what I've always felt when people would go off about vegetables and they're like, you need to be a vegan animal. Cruelty. And I agree animal cruelty is fucked up, but I don't agree. You shouldn't kill animals. You can go fuck yourself or what are they going to live forever and cure cancer if they stay alive. This is ridiculous. And guess what? They'd kill you too. There's a lot of shit that would kill you and maybe maybe me live in, you know, I just, I just don't know. I don't agree with that. So I don't hear very many people say that. So when bordain started saying that the vegetarianism is a first world problem, like, yes, thank you. So the people in the world, they need to kill things to sustain themselves. For Real. It's like there's no options. It's not like whether or not you choose to not eat pig. Like that's the only animal we have. Stupid.

Speaker 4:          02:06:59       Eat The fucking peg is. Are you going to get bored? Eight on September 11th had really American 11. Are you fucking kidding me? September 11th, 2011, nine. 11 food. Not 11 food hot dogs, Bro. Anything American? Would it be awkward if I just showed up? Now it's like you want to come in. You ever hung out with them? Never even met the guy. Really great guy. Great on his show. Bring Rachel Ray. You would be awesome on his show. Where did you grow up? Terrible. Tampa. Maybe you could take him tampon. Show what's up to eat and Tampa clubs. I'm not kidding, man. For Real. If you have strip clubs that serve Nachos, Anthony Bordain will go there and eat the Nachos. Actually, they're quite delightful and he would sit there and eat Nachos at your strip club. Dude, he eats. Or street food. Have you even watched the show?

Speaker 4:          02:07:56       Love Him. I talked to the president of travel to the other day. My man needs treat fruit or renee called me. She goes, you need to watch anthony show and just watch it because she called him Tony. She's like, because what he's doing is perfect. It is. It is fucking perfect. It is his voice. It is his personality. He doesn't do two or three takes of anything. It is fucking bear and he does it. Personality driven. It is personality driven. When I said to him, when I met him, I said, someone, when you first started doing that show, they must have just left you completely alone. He was totally. He goes, they just let you do whatever you do. You like your show. It's obvious that no one had a hand in this like this is. It's so clear that there haven't been meddling executives to checking the way he does his narratives.

Speaker 4:          02:08:42       No, not 100 percent sense. This podcast, this podcast is so pure like that. You listened to it and you go, it's a Ah. It's almost like, like watch it, like Doug Fan hope we called it the quickening. Like it just, it just happens and you're like, oh fuck. Like this podcast that we've been on today, it's so bizarre because I've laughed. Hardy Shit. I've fought hardest shit I've felt I've never enjoyed. Out of the three ones I've done, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. Doing like this has been just fucking because we're hammered. Bready clink, clink, clink, clink.

Speaker 4:          02:09:23       Rachel Ray Skater over. Would you fuck her first? When did you make her cook for you first and then fucker her. You fuck her then make or cook for you? I'll cook for her. Really? Fuck Ya. And then he'd be tired. You went in, put her leg and outstanding performance together. Here's a question for you. Joe. Do you get, if you get stuff, do you have to wait 30 minutes? Like, like pull style before you have sex? Because I've noticed lately it depends on whether it be generous. Sometimes I just want it like I know that the kids are awake and so I, I can't, I can get it off with a quickie quickie, quickie boom and then I'll fall off the bed and go into a coma. When I get those freebies, what I'm going to have to make her come. That's awesome. That's all the time. So when you have kids, but then sometimes you get a sneak one in real quick and I've been told this joke on stage. You have to balance it out. You have to make them come to. Yeah. Well yeah. No, I go, I'll go. I'll go down on her. Yeah, it's very important, but I'm not willing to listen to them. Oh, go down on her. The way you said that was like my uncle used to take us fishing.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       You have to go away to Vietnam. You stepped back, Shane Garner. I was, I was having sexual needs one extra level. You know my dad, my dad gave me the speed and your dad gave you speak. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Hear me out. My Dad, my dad is on this. He's, he doesn't call it speed. He calls it digests. I tell you this, Brian Daddy's medicine. He calls it, a doctor gave it to him for him to lose weight and so my dad gave me like six of them. It's a weird. He's going to eat to lose weight. Yes. They give you the speed and then it's not like a ton of speed. It's not like. But it's, it definitely curbs your appetite and definitely are on speed. But he gave me six. He's like, buddy, I'm concerned about your weight. Let's just jump.

Speaker 2:          02:11:21       Started a diet with these. So he gave me six of them. So I took one and then the second I took it I was like, this is fucking speed. I called my dad. I go, dad, it's speed. You got to stop because it's speed. And he's like, buddy, doctors aren't gonna prescribe the speed I was, it's like adderall. It's like it's anything but A. First of all I didn't need a fucking thing. I eat a grape and I appealed it. And how many, how long, how many hours? Like 12 hours. Just didn't need it. I was, oh and I wrote like crazy. Like I'm working on a book and I just put up like, oh, you're so in the zone, but it. But you know, it's, I know it's unhealthy. What is it like the come now? What's the come down like a not there. No, no.

Speaker 2:          02:12:08       Come down. So you took adderall. It's basically adderall. It's, it's, but it's an, it's an APP. It's specifically an appetite suppressant. What it is is. Do you remember phen phen? Yes. It is the second of the fence. I know a girl who lost a fuck load of weight on phen phen. Phen phen was a mood inhibitor and a speed, a mood inhibitor. Serotonin. It would induce your serotonin. It was like one of those things. First phen was like a zoloft and the second one, I fucking hate that. I am talking right now and I'm really not sure. Joe. I don't know. I'm just kind of speculating. This is my, this is. I'll just give you my research. The first fan was like a mood inhibitor. The second one was speed, like agora fennel hall or something. And what my dad is taking is the second of the two friends.

Speaker 2:          02:12:55       And so he gave some to me and he's like, buddy, you just gotta jump started dying man. It fucking works. Really? Yes. And then you don't come down. It's just. I mean it's just, you just get tired at the end of the day. On the pills on you. Give me one. I have one left on you right now. Snorting. Really? Just it triple it up. Yeah. So we can. So you can go fucking fight some guys and Brian and I can drive back to la. It might have a heart attack. This stuff's rolling on speed. But there's a doctor in Tampa that that prescribes it to all my friends. All my friends have lost a ton of weight. Of course they're all going to be dead in a decade, you know? But it's like so low grade, it doesn't feel like my dad's, my dad's cardiologist knows he's on it and my dad's cardiologist is better for you to take that and lose the weight because that's better for your body then to the fat than to be fat. So it get you down to my dad lost and my dad. Now this motherfucker is eating 500 calories a day. Five hundred horrible. Eddie's taken female urine. What? Like he's taken. We all do that. But what?

Speaker 2:          02:14:00       Ryan, this is your best podcast I've ever been on. Brian, you are murdering it today. Much better when he's hammered. No, he's taken this female female get drunk everyday. This female urine drip under his tongue. He's got a hold of me in a minute. Once. Just fucking come on. Dog. Female urine drip. Call Your Dad. This is ridiculous by the way. His Dad, uh, we called his dad last time. What was the for a soft softball. Oh, he broke his. Yeah. This is my dad's house. This is crazy. I'm broke. Uh, I was playing a baseball game when I got hit their mouth and I got 26 teeth, knocked out 2016. And my dad, my dad pulled me. I have 32, 82. Well you lost all your teeth. All of these are from when you're looking at from a softball, baseball, baseball, women's softball. That's incredible.

Speaker 2:          02:14:47       How long did it take before they put the teeth back? Uh, they will. They started that that day, like they started healing and putting in caps and crowns and posts and everything that day. But um, but I, this is totally true. Totally fake teeth. One hundred percent fake. No. Yeah, like everything you're seeing all the way to the gold ones. Yeah. Wow. So crazy. Listen to this. So my dad, I, this happened, my dad was my coach and I was like, oh, my teeth run home plate. I was catching my teeth won't fucking plate. And I was like, oh. And he was like, buddy, take off the couches, catcher gear, go to shortstop. And I was like, what? He's like, you gotta finish eating a real, lose a game. I was like, the fuck you talking about. And he was like, come on, let's go man up over and shortstop. He made all his teeth, got knocked out. I was a child. My Dad is a really great guy. I'm making him sound horrible. But, but he said, well, just douchey. No, he's just, he's he, let's call them. Find out about the speed or the women's urine friend. The name of it to is. Does your dad feel bad about doing that to you as a child? You know, he was just a different guy. It was a different time. That's a different time. Like he was running marathons. He was. Sounds like you could.

Speaker 2:          02:16:06       Oh No, I'm sorry. I doubt my house, my house, my old house. I got home. Sorry. I meant to my mom and dad. God, that fucking scared me. I was just like, oh my parents are like scares you bro. Yeah. Why is this scared when we start smoking some weed? No, when he did, when he did the, uh, when he did the, the, the noise of me hitting the ground and going into the next dimension. You saw me jump.

Speaker 1:          02:19:00       Wow. That doesn't sound like enough,

Speaker 9:          02:19:02       but he really doesn't eat 500 calories a day because he told Dave that he cheats and space under a thousand and that's why he's last week.

Speaker 7:          02:19:09       Thousand. Sounds reasonable. 500. Sounds crazy, right? Mom, I'm going to let you go. I love you.

Speaker 9:          02:19:15       Love you too sweetie. Bye.

Speaker 7:          02:19:16       5,000 calories is too little too though. I mean like, like if you're only doing 500 calories, what is he eating? His chicken. I did it one day with him when I was. It's a half a chicken

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       breast and a handful of Broccoli and that's one meal and the next one is another handful of Broccoli and another half a chicken breast and you're allowed a bread stick that's so extreme. The urine stuff gets you. It's like a testosterone thing. It starts sort of jasmine, you and he gets like B, 12 shots and he goes to this doctor

Speaker 3:          02:19:49       all the time and yeah. Pissed or whatever. I've never worked for the news. Yeah. You to be more specific. They invaded Sam B. Twelve shots. The fucking pregnant. Piss on. You know, he's on speed. Was he got sentenced to use this? She say placenta. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:20:17       Yeah. Have something to do with placenta. I get my Puente students at GSA in Glendale. It's cheaper in Glendale. Yeah, Glendale. Really? I don't know. There's just more in Glendale. Glendale. Yeah. I just got your uh, laptop. What? I just understood your laptop. Oh, it's snow white. Still waiting in the apple laptop broke just now. The crusher. Quite hammered. I'm not. I'm first of all, I'm the suburbs. One in the whole room. That's impossible. No 100 percent. Impossible or possible sound possible? It's totally possible. The person that says that the service person in the room is rarely sobers person in the room. Let's do a protest. All right. Let's. Do you want to do a google it? Sober tests if you had a Dui? Never will. Listen, I could do those things when I'm drunk. Uh, would you eat Rachel Ray's ass? No. Why are we doing Rachel Ray? I would say

Speaker 3:          02:21:12       it's over time. It's totally going to lose Brian. So Brian is sober. He's been cleared. Please leave the room. You are cleared me to left.

Speaker 2:          02:21:26       This is like fucking heads up. Poker. I'm all in. I'm all in with my liver. You're all in and you're stuttering. Okay. Congratulations. By the way, on the hurricane this weekend, you will not be get having a show with Carlson. Celia Mysia. Joe, you've been getting this wrong so many years. It's been a whole lot of weight lately, so maybe he needs to be called them Sia. Yeah. Maybe he's turned over a new leaf. Yeah. Maybe or all. He's probably into Jujitsu. Married woman's hearing

Speaker 3:          02:22:00       isn't a woman's urine. HCG, the Glendale. And you've got to get the good pregnant woman's during the Mexican shit. That's the strong stuff. Just a touch of Jalapeno in it. Squirted into your mouth. You just. The weight just sheds. Appeals. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       My favorite podcast ever. I think it's my favorite. I just want to do it sober one again. All right, now listen, we can. You just drank. The last one we did drunk was Doug Stanhope. That was like a great fucking. Why don't you come back? We needed that. We love to man before he shoots himself. Oh, that's just the show. Doug's good. No, it's sad watching that. Although if he kills himself, you know, hunter s Thompson style, when he decides that his body's falling apart, I wouldn't be surprised. But I think that's probably a really logical way to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:22:55       Have you heard his podcast with Tom Rhodes? Here's a hope. He did a podcast with Tom Rhodes. Really? Uh, it's, I, I just stumbled on it because I was going through this, uh, Tom Rhodes phase and I, and I found it. He, they date it is the most beautiful ending of a podcast I've ever heard. They talk about taking mushrooms together and then thinking the earth who's going to spend them off and Tom Rhodes starts going, yeah, and this song was playing in the background and Doug was like, it was, and then I decided I didn't have the wherewithal to to get up and use the restrooms, urinated in my pants and Bingo. Took my pants and change me and Tom Rhodes, he goes, who was one of those beautiful moments? And then they start singing together together. They start singing the song and it picks up in the background and it's the most awesome moment I've ever heard and I was like, it's so beautiful.

Speaker 2:          02:23:46       If you just go. If you googled the podcast and you just hear, don't listen to the whole thing because Tom Roses sometimes Tom Rhodes sometime mean I liked tom rose, but like he tells doug, he goes, Doug, what's going on with the stand up? And Doug's has been drinking again and he's on an ambient in this podcast. And so. And he, he's been drinking a lot. So he says at the beginning, don't miss anything. I'm saying because I don't know what I'm fucking saying tonight. And then Doug says he was dealt with standup. Doug goes, I'm fucking done. I hate it. I've done everything I'm doing. I'm just rewriting the same jokes. I'm a shill. If I could just quit this and fucking never come back, I'd do it tomorrow. And then silent Tom goes, so what do you like about my standup?

Speaker 4:          02:24:30       It was a fake question. It's clear that there, but just so fucking hammered in this podcast and if you add that, that's how we should end today. We should all sing a song together about my standup. That's the name of the song. Are you guys in key? I did. Um, I did mushrooms with Doug the day the war broke out the very day of we did, you know, it was breaking out. We knew it was broken out, so we decided to go out to the desert to do drugs. We went to a yawn, Irvin's house. My man who was on this podcast, we've ever done that. Dan's a good guy. Didn't work out, but listen to thinking it was Aubrey Plaza. I told Brian that, who's the girl from 30 rock? Mark Marin

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       had interviewed. I'll reply to you interviewed the Aubrey Marcus. I just saw Aubrey and read the description on Marin's and I go to 30 rock chick. I want to hear how I want to hear how joe deals with it before I go to Marin. It's only here the jove version first because that'll be a little different. It's going to be all gossip. Celebrity gossip. Marin. I want to hear how joe deals with it and I hear it and it's operating. That's a dude. I go, oh, that must be the dude from from parks and recreation. And he's like, yeah, I changed my name. I did all this Iowaska and I'm like, fuck, there's couple of balls. He's on NBC talking about going to Iowasca. It's fucking driven as balls. NBC. He's on parks and recreation. Oh, that's funny. You thought it was the whole podcast. I'm like, man, this guy is a deep motherfucker and then I go to Marin's and it's a chick. I go, oh, fucking different offerings. But what you're saying about mushrooms and you and hope that we did it,

Speaker 1:          02:26:12       data war broke out. We knew that the war with the United States was going to war on this particular day. So we drove out to the desert with this dude lived. We got blitzkrieg on machines. We took a couple different kinds. We started out with the Amanita [inaudible] area and then we moved our way into psilocybe cubensis.

Speaker 2:          02:26:30       Wait, there's different mushrooms. Oh yeah, yeah. The ammunition and Endeca. Endeca. What's, what's the ones that grow on a cow? Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       Those are [inaudible] cubensis mushrooms. But there's different kinds of cubensis mushrooms. There's a bunch of different species of psychedelic mushrooms, including some that have no history or known history of human use, their psychedelic chemicals that people that we don't even believe that people discovered like a Hawaiian baby. Woodrow. Um, there's a, I believe there's no evidence of human use of that until I really recently. And it contains the same chemical compounds as Lsd, a believer. I'm, yeah. I'm, I'm might be a little off on that. Lysergic acid. I know it's something to do with that and there, but either way it's a very strong psychedelic compound, but there's almost no history of human use, so it was like one of those weird things where people might have missed that one, you know? No, I can't do psychedelics anymore. No. Why do you say that? Because I know my brain the last time I keep saying that, but let me tell you something that anybody tells me. I know my brain is the number one candidate for a psychedelic experience because you say that you can't do psychedelics, but you know your brain. What I. What I hear is my ego has tricked me into this position who are have stood my ground and I'm terrified of anything really truly frightening and revolutionary, so I'm going to operate by clearly defined, predetermined pattern of behavior that I find acceptable and I'm going to stick to that whenever anybody brings it up and then everybody brings it up. I'm going to say, well, I know my brain,

Speaker 2:          02:28:00       and the last time you did it, you did it before a show. You can't. You can't do shrooms in the show and didn't get work on a show, and I was watching shadow people in the crowds and he's scared of shadow people. Every time we shrooms, he. I can't. I know. I mean I could, I could, I could theoretically eat mushrooms if it was the right moment. The right time. Could 100 percent. No, but it would definitely need to be during the day, like couldn't do it at night. I'd never been able to do it at night.

Speaker 1:          02:28:23       Heightened states of tension that are appropriate. You know, it's understandable if you're at war, if you're, you know, you're hunting, gathering your fucking chasing a deer, but heightened stakes for no reason which you seem to acquire. Yeah. I don't know how to deal with them. To me, you look at the natural balance of a human being. Genetically we have the same DNA as fucking people that live 10,000 years ago that were throwing pointed sticks at running animals. We have the same Goddamn DNA yet we have these bodies that we don't exercise. We don't push them, we don't make them do things and I think there's a great deal of, of, of human tension and stress and and and imbalanced that comes from not taking care of your body, that your body misfires and sends chemical signals that don't make sense and it's confused and doesn't know how to handle itself and it's insecure and it's fucked up and it's weird because you don't understand it. Exactly. And that makes your body. Did it fucks with you, it deceives you, it throws you bad signal.

Speaker 2:          02:29:27       I'm afraid I'm afraid because when like my brain already fires by itself, like it just starts saying things and I, and I think we're comedy. My comedy comes from at least and I'm afraid when like now I get to a point, this is where I was last time is we took some mushrooms and I realized that the second I took them that I'm a father and I was like, what the fuck am I doing? I can't get off the grid the way I did in college. I can't just hop off the grid, disappeared for six hours, have a fun adventure down the itch and Tuck me like I'm a father who's fucking with not only my livelihood but the livelihood of my children, like if I do pull a trigger in my head and I can't come back if something fucks up in my head, I have now ruined life for too long and that, that thought is what fucked me up for the night. And then one of my buddies like, fucking just get as drunk as you possibly can. I was like, alright, that's what we'll do. So. But that. And it was a fun night. I had a great night after that when I was like, fuck it, I'll just keep drinking. That's my biggest. That's my, that's where my head. It lives when it comes to psychedelics,

Speaker 1:          02:30:28       will you talk to the wrong dude? See if you were talking to me.

Speaker 2:          02:30:32       Oh, I see. Okay. You're the kind of person that I would be. I would be fine. Um, I would, if I was going to do mushrooms again, I would definitely want you to do it with you.

Speaker 4:          02:30:43       Even if you're not going to be okay, it's eventually going to be okay. I wouldn't remember that. Remember, I wouldn't even know what. You're not going to be. Okay. You're eventually going to be okay because this is temporary. Even if you're not going to be okay, you're going to be okay. I just want to get your deprivation tank. You can do it. Why wouldn't you do drugs with me? Because I think you would freak me the fuck out. Well, just it'd be way too intense and you would scare the fuck out of me. Like it'd be too intense for me. Joey Diaz was scared. The fuck could not do mushrooms to Joe and say, Oh, I cannot deal with Joey. Just all of a sudden snapping and yelling me for no reason. Which by the way, red already got mad at Brian when he was on acid. Serious? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:31:26       Uh, oh yeah. I said at the UFC, but he got he. Joe, you know, I'm starting to think that I just don't mix well at Jewish people.

Speaker 4:          02:31:34       Oh a great way to end or Hollywood. Andy Dick on the line now.

Speaker 2:          02:31:47       Just kidding. No, I mean he's always mad at me, I always rubbed me the wrong way and it's, it's like, because it already is a certain people that I always get along with and then there's people like Laurie who is already is already like, and I will, you know, you know, are a million ways better than I do, but I will definitely say that Ari is a different type of human being. He told me the other day, Tom Scott calls me. He goes, someone's telling that Tracy Morgan story that's working with already this weekend. I said, shut up. I go, what had already said already say to him. He goes, oh, nothing. I go, wait. So ours is working with a guy that was telling the Tracy Morgan story and he's saying some other celebrities tell him this, but it really happened to me. This art is working with the guy for fucking six shows.

Speaker 2:          02:32:27       Who is this guy? It's a black comic and he told the whole weekend, I don't know the name because fucking he doesn't know his name. He worked with already the whole weekend and told this story on stage. Fucking sad. He doesn't remember. He goes, I forget, you know, I was trying to work some fuzzy. I was pretty high. They had good. We'd like, it was just typical bar that I go, I go, how do you not like, I love like if that, if someone was telling a story of or Joe's or yours, the onstage, I would be texting you tomorrow. But rhs was like, well that's fucked up.

Speaker 1:          02:33:01       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:33:01       Right. People don't drink, don't know how good food is because right now I've had a couple of periods right now. I've had a couple of beers and I'm looking at the clock and I know in 10 minutes [inaudible] in culver city closes. We can't really make it unless we leave right now.

Speaker 1:          02:33:21       Now the only way to get a real sausage sub sausage with fucking sausage. Tomato sauce. Sausage and peppers in culver city. Cavaradossi? No, not culver city. Um, did I say culver city?

Speaker 2:          02:33:32       He did, yeah, he did. I guess he was drunk.

Speaker 1:          02:33:36       What's his name? Is M A, a c might be chatsworth. No. Huh?

Speaker 4:          02:33:45       Canoga Park. Canoga Park. That's what it is

Speaker 1:          02:33:50       though. Unfortunately. I'm fuck up. That's blues man. Dudes, you don't know. That's one of the things I love about bordain that eats treat food. He'd fucking fried sausage peppers on the side of the highway

Speaker 2:          02:34:02       and he doesn't. I get terrified sometimes that I go, Oh man, I don't like you ever seen those. It's always fucking terrified about something. You get terrified about everything. I wanted to stop. I want it. You wanted to start? I wanted to stop, but I just like worried though that if it stops the you're not going to be fun anymore. They wanted to put me on pills. They said I had social anxiety disorder. I was like, I don't fucking, I don't like that shit. And they were like, well we want to get you on a mood stabilizer. Like one of those mood stable as a cola broke pill. Yeah, take away what makes you interesting? Yeah. It's the thing that like my brain works a certain way. I'm cool with that. My Wife's school that my kids are cool with it. My friend circle that, if you don't know me, it may be weird, but I get it and I, I fuck around and I, you know, I will test the boundaries of my mind, but I definitely wouldn't. I don't know. It's good. Your brain is

Speaker 1:          02:34:51       good. This is different. You know, this, I believe that there's a bunch different components and ingredients that all put together to make everything including society and human beings and people have to be different. There has to be different kinds of people and you know, and too much society wants to take people that really don't have problems. They're just. I mean everybody has problems but they're just fucking different and society wants to curve their edges and, and, and, and straighten their curves and make them, you know, something that fits. Yeah. No, and that's, that's unfortunate man, because the most brilliant people, the most fun people in my life, the Doug stand hopes and the Joey Diaz is and the burke crushers and you know, all these people. This life is richer because I know people like that.

Speaker 2:          02:35:40       I liked the spontaneity. All I keep thinking the whole time, let's drink some pis like that's all that because of the. Because we talked about. I wonder how bad it is. Like I'm just in the right mood. Bad. Did you get your money? No, I don't want to drink your pitch. Why not? And you want me to go get some glasses? Come on and bring it forward. Drink. Yeah, we'll just trying to close. Brian. Scared. There's no reason
