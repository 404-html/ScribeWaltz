Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Four three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Mr. Baker, our ancestor. Real good. I'm doing well. Thanks for [inaudible]. What's going on, man? What are you doing in town? Uh, just, uh, was in town, one of the, uh, some, uh, work on a sizzle reel for a show, a new show. Can you talk about that? You tell people what it is? Well, it's actually two of them are one I can talk about. I can tease it a little bit. Um, the marketing department I guess has to approve everything that's said. Um, it started out, it's going to be on the discovery network, I think a science channel and it was starting to main filming in February and we'll should be finished by the end of March. So standby. But it's started with a discussion about, um, hidden budgets in the Defense Department. Like dark art stuff. Yeah, it's good. The show's going to be called black files. Ah, and the UFO type shit.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Well, there's gonna be some of that, a song, but, but from a, you know, not from a, you know, did they lie land, did they not? It's, it's, well really actually kind of tearing into, uh, some of the programs that were funded by, you know, hidden money, uh, in the Defense Department. And do they do that? Well, I mean if you take like the CIA for example, uh, the agency's budget is hidden inside. It's not hidden, but it's placed inside the Defense Department and it's, and it's classified piece of information obviously. Cause a lot of the defense department gets a certain budget. The CIA gets a piece of that, but nobody's allowed to know how much or where it's spent. Right. Cause obviously, you know, the Russians, the Chinese, whomever would like to know, you know, how much money is a sent over to the agency so that they can get a sense of a size, resources, capabilities, that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Uh, so that's where the, the show concept started. You know, what, what does that money spent on both in the old days and now. So it's a, it's, it kind of spans, you know, historical operations and events and activities and special units. And it comes up to the present time and says, you know, whereas, you know, money being devoted now for new technology or new programs, new operations, new intelligence, gathering efforts, whatever it might be. So it's, yeah, I think it's, it's got a lot of promise, you know, hopefully people tune in and find that interesting. Uh, well people are always curious about where the money goes. Yeah, yeah. And you know, I am like, who oversees it? Who gets, who gets to decide like what gets spent on what and how much money goes where. And I do actually, no, I do, that's my job.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Um, it's a good question. I, you know, that's, I think a lot of people would be surprised at the amount that we're talking about it. And it's not just, it's not, the intelligence community is also in the military obviously. Um, can you discuss the actual numbers or could you discuss the numbers that they use to have a, we'll be able to discuss the numbers that went into past operations, but anything that's currently classified, obviously it's not going to touch on. But we've been working hard and the has been working very hard to get excellent access. You know, where possible and get cooperation where possible. Uh, it's going to be a fairly immersive effort. So that's the benefit of the even divulging any of this information. Like why would they cooperate? Why wouldn't they say, Hey, shut the fuck up. Yeah. Well, and, and, and, and frankly they should and they have and they will, but not necessarily with the agency, but with other departments.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       And certainly within the military there's some information out there that's accessible. There's some ability to get them to cooperate on, on certain, again, declassified operations that just haven't come to light. I look a lot of Shit's been declassified over the years that's just never been looked at or talked about. You know, somebody maybe gets a wild hair up their ass and this is says, I want to look into this program. And then they start peeling it back. It's not that it's classified, it's just nobody's ever bothered to dig into that information, wants it is a declassified. So, you know, it's, it's gonna be a lot of fun. A lot of travel, uh, some great people working on the program. But, you know, apparently I have to, uh, keep it pretty much at that until the marketing department says, okay, here's what you can say. So eventually you'll be able to spill the beans and tell us everything.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       That's exactly. So like if they're making something like the b 52, like if they're making a stealth bomber, if they're making some spaceship looking thing, like you're talking to this insane amount of money in research and development and the budget of these things and they have to keep all that under wraps. Yeah. Shit. Yeah. I mean, look, you go back to the old days of, um, of the youtube program. You have to program was developed, it designed, built, maintained, flown by the CIA all those years ago. Right now, that was a massive effort and a lot of money and it was done under budget and it was done on time. Um, in part because I think, you know, things were a little bit easier back then and we weren't all pissing on each other up on Capitol Hill Been, uh, yeah, there's so it's, it's, it's programs like that that I think will surprise people when they find out both who was running it, who was responsible.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Um, and to the degree possible, you know, what did it cost us and you know, who was involved and, and to what degree did it lead to something else that we're doing now. So anyway, there's, there's a lot of, a lot of, you know, threads to pull on. I think it should be a lot of, a lot of fun. So there's constantly projects that are in development that people, other than the people that need to know, the general public has no idea. Like that's always the, the, the purse, the people on the outside, folks like myself, you look at the, he'd go, well, why don't we kind of, Shit they have that they don't tell us about like that's what you always want. Like, what kind of invisibility cloak, what kind of crazy, you know, that would be good if dark matter weapons, what are they doing?

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       Yeah, no it's it and it's, it's true. I mean you get these incredibly smart people and it, but it comes down to it. It's as simple as as somebody gets an idea, they're sitting around a table. It's not unlike going out with your buddies and drinking and thinking and I'll come with somebody comes up with some dumb ass idea. The next thing you know it, it turns into a TV show or something. But it's, uh, it's, it's not unlike that. A lot of smart guys sitting around a table thinking, well here's the problem. How do we resolve it? And the key is to do it creatively, right? They come up with it. Cause if you get a bunch of engineers around a table, you hope that they're not at all approaching it from the same point of view. Right? It's like with an operation. If you've got that, you've got a high value target out there and you've got to figure out how to get, get access, get to them. You want ideas coming in from all directions, so you don't want it. You don't want to squelch creativity. And believe it or not, I mean the Intel community and the military, they've been enormously creative over the years in developing new technologies and developing operational ideas and methodologies. So it's what we're trying to do is shed some light on that. Well, I would imagine there's a certain

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       no amount of, I don't want to use the word fun, but that's really the right word. Like some of it's gotta be fun to develop this stuff and implement it and go out and get bad guys with it and to see your project come to fruition and actually have a positive effect on the world.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       Absolutely. Yeah. I mean if you, it really is, it's, it's that simply because you know, an operations anyway, you know, you, you engage in something out there in, in some place around the world, wherever it may be. And you know, you realize as you're walking away that, you know, they're not a lot of people doing this at this moment on the planet. Right? I mean, so, so the operational activity itself is enormously entertaining as long as it goes right. Uh, but it's also the buildup. It's all that homework that gets you there, right? It's, it's like that takedown and bin Laden. We didn't just happen to get lucky and rock up on his doorstep right in the bottom bud. That was eight or nine years of fucking hard work. Right? Heavy lifting, chasing down countless bad leads and doing enormous amounts of surveillance, street work and tracking down assets and doing, I mean just it just the hard, hard work that eventually allowed the, you know, all those guys from the teams to land and do their job.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       What's interesting to me too is that the guy who was writing the book about all this stuff and talking about, you know, the man who shot bin Ladin Dot guy's persona non grata in the community. Like you talked to the other seals, they're like, you don't, you don't do that right now. You don't do that. You know, you don't write books about that. You don't talk about that and do it for a short term gain. You know, you make some profit off of it, but you lose the brothership,

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       you lose a, yeah, exactly. You, you're, you're kind of on the outs in the club and, but I will say this, the reason why I think, uh, the Horse got out of the barn on, on that whole issue of, of guys writing books or getting out there and talking about specific operations is because senior commanders and end senior people, right. People that came out of the top levels of government, uh, started writing their memoirs, you know, started revisiting history while they were, it was their watch and coming up with, you know, their explanations for history. And I think all the guys below, you know, junior ranks and street level operators, they looked at that and thought, well, what the fuck? If they can do it, why not me? And because you've gotta set the tone from the top. And I think that's where it got it. Got All know, kind of sideways. Plus when you have someone who you has a crazy

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       story like Marcus Luttrell and it becomes an amazing movie. It also, it does help the community, right? Because it gets a bunch of people that are really interested in becoming a seal. It gets people to appreciate the, the unbelievable sacrifice and hard work that's involved.

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       Yeah. I think that's, I think that there is an upside, right? Yeah. There's an upside to it, but I think it's a fine balance. Right. What point do you go over that line? So you're right in the sense that, you know, we'd see that with a w whom have with the FBI or dea, you know, they got out there and put their thumbprint on some TV shows, right? Because I think it kind of, it expanded in part a awareness of, of what they do. I'm sure it helped their recruitment. Um, and so the seals are no different. But at the same time, uh, you know, you sign a piece of paper at the very beginning that says you're going to keep your Yap shut and, and it's one thing to come out with from whatever unit or whatever team or whatever organization and say, I'm going to write a, I don't know about my time in, and it's not a look at sources and methods. Not Look at operations. It's not that it's more of, you know, this is what happened during my time. And I think there's, I'm not explaining it very well, but I think there's a way you can do that without screwing the pooch. But I think that, uh, I think the seals got overexposed and I think a lot of the guys, uh, resent that. And so, but again, you're right there, there was some upsides

Speaker 2:          00:10:19       to it. Well, there's upside to some of the stores, right? Like I've definitely these upside to Marcus Luttrell store cause it's just so incredible. He question here about it. But I think that there's also, it's important to maintain that honor. It's a more important to maintain that, that bond of silence, you know, that you guys, you know, they're doing something that is probably one of the most dangerous and one of the most in terms of special operations, one of the most significant in, in, in all of military in this country.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       But yeah, I think it's the old school guys, the old school operators out of the teams are definitely like, yeah, just, you know, shut your pie hole. Don't talk about this, the newer guys again, because they came up in a different time. I mean information flows all around as much easier and quicker than it did in the seventies and eighties and you know, early nineties. But nowadays people are just used to reading everything as soon as it happens and creates a different mindset. So the younger guys in there, they don't necessarily view it the same way.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       Think about it until the Dick Marchenko books came out. And those were long time as long time ago. Yeah. That's when I really was like, wow, I can't wear regular clothes. I mean, I mean, I think I was like probably 18 or 19 when those books were out. And I remember thinking, what is, this is crazy wear long hair. And they dress like hippies. It just normal and go out and invade,

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       go ahead and fade. And it's just, they invading hippies, but you know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       get, I mean, Marchenko was famous for wanting his guys to get drunk together to before, like big things. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Well it's that, it's that idea of team building, Camaraderie and however you do it. Uh, but there was, there was that sense that we do it and it's off the radar and it's not talked about. And we take pride in that. But again, I'll go back to the same thing if, if, uh, if you don't, I'm like Bob Gates, you know, by gates writes a book, you know, I'm a former director of the agency and he's a brilliant guy, great guy. But he writes a book and you know, and then you get somebody else, maybe Mike Morrell writes a book. And so from, you know, inside the CIA, you got a lot of officers going, well, she had, maybe when I get out I'll write a book because what I'm doing is pretty damn interesting. And there's no laws against that. Well, there, yeah, there are [inaudible] and you know, anybody who, uh, reveal sources and methods, anybody who, who, uh, who breaks their agreements in terms of the proper handling, which is a lifetime agreement of, of classified information, they're supposed to be consequences.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       And sometimes there are, and sometimes if you're senior enough, maybe there's not. Uh, but uh, yeah, you, you know, you sign a piece of paper at the very beginning. I'll never forget that. I read it and on it and I said, okay, go ahead. There was, it says keep your Yap Shit. I mean I don't want to over simplify it, but it says [inaudible] are being given the responsibility of handling a extremely sensitive information and information that, that if released can easily result in the loss of life. I mean it's as simple as that essentially. And your obligation is to shut your mouth and not talk about sources and methods and things that you know better not to talk about. And, but I think that that kind of the drip, drip, drip, right, of the books and the things that come out and the, and the anonymous sources look at New York Times can write a in a tire front page article based on nothing but anonymous sources nowadays never used to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       Right. You know, editors would sit there and go, well, you know, you've got to get yourself some additional sources and that we can discuss so people can put it in context. Nowadays, that's not the case. Why do you think that is? You know, I think Chris, I dunno, we're part of it is low standards. Yeah. I think lower standards. I think competition, um, I think the desire to get information out there quickly because every journalist is now, uh, playing beat the clock with everybody who's got a smartphone, right? Fancies themselves a blogger or a journalist on twitter or whatever. So they're all, they're all doing this. And I think it's just this idea, right? That says, uh, it reminds me of me. I had a meeting with, uh, with, uh, my company diligence for all your information and security needs. And it was with a major multinational corporation and I was meeting with their head of security and some other folks and they do a lot of work overseas and some very difficult places and the competition that they face in their sectors, huge.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       And so we went in there and we thought this would be great. There's a lot of things we can do for them in terms of gathering information, preventing them from making mistakes as they're going into a new market. All of these things. And the bottom line was they said, they looked at me and he said, Nah, you know what? Competition's so fierce. We're just going to go in. If we make mistakes, we'll clean it up later. And they were willing to do that. It's, it's like acceptable lost credit card fraud loss, you know, for mastercard or whomever. They're willing to accept millions and millions and millions of dollars as an acceptable loss for, for the cost of doing business. And so it's a little bit like that. I think with journalism, they, they're willing to just throw shit out there and hey, if they have to make a retraction fine.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       But it compromises the way a person like myself views the news. I mean, look, I hate to quote trump, but when he, he's like parents that fake news term over and over again. You, if you are a person who's, or an organization is being accused of lying, it seems to me you should really dot your i's and cross your t's from then on out. I mean, you're being accused of lying by the president and I think irresponsibly accused. I mean the way he does it, he does it to avoid questions that make them uncomfortable. I mean, and as the president, I just don't think you should be able to do that. You can't point to someone from CNN and you're fake news. Like what does it serves 12 right? It serves no purpose for the press that I agree with you on a preset. I so much of what this administration does is a self inflicted wound.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       Right. And, and part of it is, is, is, is that they're just crap at messaging. Part of it is this idea that, you know, he just says what's on his mind and he does, right. It's almost like he's got tourettes, but I think he views it as a strength. He views it as a reason why he got elected. And a lot of people out there think, yeah, that's his, his base. You know, the people that are really behind them no matter what. I think they view it as part of his charm as well. And the problem is he does release classified information sometimes. Yeah. We've had that problem with, uh, several administrations. They just don't know what to not say. Well, I think part of it again is, uh, yeah, there's, there's a, a laxness that's developed over the years and I don't know why.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       Right? Because, you know, I mean, I think about all the various security issues we face. And look, we've been at war for 17 years, right? Since nine 11 and all these things that have been happening to us, you would think that we'd be pretty buttoned up. But now every administration has had its moment where it's let slip. And whether it was the press secretary of whether it was somebody rushing to the podium, it was somebody on Capitol Hill. I mean, they're famous for it up there, you know, congressmen and congresswomen or senators all in the, in, in, in a rush to get in front of the camera to talk about something and then, you know, shit happens. Thanks. Get out that they shouldn't. So I think it's, it all kind of contributes to this mentality that we started off talking about with, with the seals were, you know, why are we in this point where people are writing books and maybe getting outside the box?

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       And I think it's just because, yeah, it's this constant drip and lowering of standards like you mentioned, I think, and it's a, I don't think we walk that dog bag. I don't, you know, it just the way it is now, you're not in the agency anymore, but I'm sure you stay tight with people that are still there. What, what is the attitude now with this administration? Like what they're doing with like the way he attacks the FBI and way, like, it just seems, it seems so reckless. Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a unusual, I mean that, look, I, there's, here's the way I feel, but I didn't vote for, for president. I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton. I think either of them than the best we could do when a country of over 300 million people, and we've talked about this before, that it was you or I that did what Hillary did.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       We'd be in jail. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so, um, but as far as you know, what the, the, the current mood inside the agency as, I mean, if you talk to some former folks, they, you know, they, they'll say, ah, morale is awful. It was terrible. And then, you know, they just, you know, hating life because there's not, I don't find that, I find that, um, the, frankly they're just more focused on operational concerns and priorities and tasking than anything else. Everybody's got a personal opinion. Right. But I do think that the agency has proven itself over the years at being better at pushing that down and understanding. And in part because it's a smaller organization, right then most of them then almost all of them and, but he's, he's not, he doesn't go after the CIA. Right. It's only going after the FBI. He's got the FBI.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       I mean, he's, you know, he's questioned, he's done. He's done some things in terms of questioning CIA analysis and, uh, and, and, uh, you know, some of the advice and guidance that they provided. But that again, you sort of look at and go, hey, look, we're feeding this into the NSC, the National Security Council. You guys, you know, that's, that's, that's an editorial process. At that point, you guys are going to have to make your decisions. Um, uh, you know, have, people are going to say, I'm just saying this because I'm subjective and I, you know, I'm providing top cover for the agency, but for the most part, they just focus on getting shit done. And we also have the benefit of big focused overseas. So we're not like the bureau is, you know, and it's a domestic organization, right? So they, you know, they're drawn in, the agency's got the advantage of, look, we're having to deal with crap over there and not here.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       So now, what did you think when he said that we're going to pull out of Syria? Well, first of all, yeah, yeah, they just had that, uh, we've, we've lost some servicemen up in northern Syria today. Um, today as a result of a bombing up there. Yeah, Isis has taken credit for it. So there, there was a, uh, patrol and we, and we've got roughly 2000 personnel in Syria. And for the most part, what are they doing there where they're providing a guidance training. Um, they're assisting with targeting, uh, uh, and because the, the air power is incredibly important over there right now. And so we are, uh, our personnel are, uh, very much involved in selection of identification of targets, uh, for the air campaign. And, um, so we have these 2000 troops here. President says he's going to withdraw and then then some of the members of administration started walking that dog back, right.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       And saying, man, I know it may not happen right away, but yeah, they just, there was just a, a routine patrol. Uh, if there this never really such thing as a routine patrol, but there's a patrol, um, and it got hit. Uh, the military is not releasing a lot of details because they haven't finished notifying next to kin, but, um, numbers so far indicate possibly for service, um, uh, lost. Um, and that's going to refocus, I think Congress and hopefully the White House on what the hell is going on. The problem I've got with it is in terms of withdrawing, look, we could stay there forever and not accomplish the task, right? If the task is to finally defeat whatever that means, uh, radical Islamic jihadists, uh, Isis, uh, that shit's never going to happen. Not In our lifetimes. We're not going to get rid of that mentality that, that ideology, uh, the sort of what seems to be sometimes a bottomless well of recruits that they can draw on their ability to morph into something else as al Qaeda did, um, over, depending on how successful we are in a campaign against them, they're like, you know, again, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's like, you know, step on roaches over here and they pop up over here.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       So I think it's the, the, the, the biggest problem I've got is, is that if we leave, we're not, we're not. Um, you know, it's not like we're engaged in firefights everyday with isis over there. Right. We've left that to our allies and our allies in most part up there in the north of Syria are the Kurds. The Kurds have been our allies in one way or another in that part of the world for a long time now. And it played a very important role and we have not been particularly honorable over the, over the years in terms of how sometimes we deal with them. If we walk out, if we leave, then uh, Irwin, you know, the head of Turkey, I guarantee you we'll be in there in short order to kill as many of them as possible because that's just what the Turkish authorities are going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       They honestly, uh, that they couldn't be happier with the announcement that we're going to leave because that opens the door for them to think, go in there and from their perspective, stamp out the Kurdish alliance that have been our allies. We're the only thing our presence at small presence, you know, not minimizing it, but it, you know, 2000 troops has been what's prevented them from doing that. So that's, that's the number one issue I've got. The other is, I have no idea why any president or vice president or anybody in the government ever, not this is administration or any administration ever thinks it's a, it's a good idea to say we've defeated the enemy. Uh, when we're talking about radical Islam, we've seen it over and over again from previous administration, from the Bush administration. Every time they say, you know, we were, we've done it, mission accomplished, mission accomplished though we'd be, we'd beaten al Qaeda, we beat nicest. That's it. There's no upside to saying that. Shut the fuck up. Stop saying things like that. It's again, it's a self inflicted wound at the, because now what's happening in the media is not focused on the fact that we've lost servicemen. They're focused on, well, just, uh, just the other day the president said, we defeated Isis and the vice president today said the same thing. Now look what's happened. There's no benefit to saying that. And, and, and it's not going to happen anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       So the goal of being over there is to assist our allies, but also to make sure that these radical factions don't become more powerful. And then eventually affect us and attack us. And so we can keep an eye on what they're planning, what they're doing. Is that, is that an accurate

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       yeah, it is. It, it, it's, it's, it's exactly it. I mean, if you look at the reason we went into Afghanistan, right? If we go back all those years, Holy Shit. Uh, and that was because the Taliban allowed, um, al Qaeda to establish a beachhead in there for training and for communications and for finance and for plotting and planning attacks outside of Afghanistan against us and our allies. That's why we went in there, aside from just seeking revenge, obviously was to route that out. We then stayed, you know, thinking somehow we were going to turn the tide of history and create some pseudo federal democracy. Right? So that didn't, that didn't work. But the reason now for being in Syria is yes, we, we have done a very solid job of beating back isis, removing their territory and degrading their ability to operate. But we haven't stamped them out.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       We haven't defeated them yet. They're still there. And so we've been providing the support and the, again in the form of, uh, weapons, hardware, gear of resources, training, and most importantly a comp, uh, combat air operations, air assaults. And, um, that's been critically important. If we leave, I have no doubt that isis will find some way to rejuvenate, maybe not in its current form, but, and maybe not in the same exact locations, but they don't work. Cause that's what they do. They just, they just find a way to adapt. And we already know what's happened in the past when we, when we left Iraq, we saw what happened with the rise of Isis. So, you know, I do I want to stay there forever. Absolutely not. But both sides can make a valid argument. One for staying, one for leaving my, I think the best argument for staying in the, in it certainly is short and midterm, is to ensure that ertl on doesn't slaughter a bunch of Kurtz who have been working with us. Uh, honorably. Um, you know, I don't know how else to say that. So we'll see what happens. I, the

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       best argument to stay is to protect the people that helped us to protect our allies. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not in our best interest is in the best interest of our commitment and agreement with them.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       Well, is it in our national security interests do to stay in Syria, for example? Right. There was this, that has so many levels to this thing, and I'm sure right now everybody's listening going off. Fuck Sake. He's not going to disappear down a rabbit hole. But, but uh, yes, I am. Uh, eh. For a while there, there was this, this, this idea, this was ridiculous pie in the sky thought that we were going to get the Russians out of Syria, that we're going to fucking happen. Russian said the only port for their Black Sea fleet as in Syria, you know, w w they've been there for decades and decades along with Iran. We're net, it's not gonna happen unless we want to go to war with Russia to kick them out of Syria. That's not in our best interest. So is it in our national security interest to keep troops there to fight and try to minimize Russian involvement in Syria?

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       I don't think so because we're not going to shift them off that dime without going directly at them. Right. It's in their best interest to stay and every nation accidents own best interest. Are we going to shift Iran? Are we going to keep Iran from forming too late for that? They've already got a beachhead there that they're not going to give up. And so you've got to set those issues aside and say, well, what the hell are we doing there? Oh we, oh we there simply because we have to, you know, finish the fight against Isis. Well, you know, at some point you gotta say, you know, I guess I wouldn't say that we've, we're, we've defeated them, but I think we would say, yeah, we've degraded them sufficiently that we can, we can now operate from elsewhere and then we can operate from forward basis and in other locations where we're currently based. Great. But again, I keep coming back to the same thing that, you know, we've, we've worked with the Kurds. Is this in our national security interest? Well, no, I guess it's not, but there's something that tells me it's the right thing to do and maybe sometimes that's enough, you know, that we should, we should not let [inaudible] have his way

Speaker 2:          00:28:34       and also longterm wouldn't it be in our best interest to honor our commitment and make sure that we protect our allies so that in the future other allies would be more willing to cooperate with us because they understand that once we're committed, we're fully committed and we stay and we stand for something. Yeah. So what's the benefit of getting out? Like the people that see, think we should get out? Like when trump said he wanted to pull out, like what's his thinking

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       runs particularly deep? I think it just, I think it's, you know, uh, during the campaign he talked about, you know, stopping the endless wars. That's very popular concept right now. Again, nobody wants to, I mean, what the hell? I mean, and so it will be interesting to see, you know, what today's sad event does up on Capitol Hill, you know, do they, do they rethink their, the, the withdrawal or do they accelerate it?

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       Well, like when they had the buildup in Iraq and it was highly criticized but then it was very effective, like it did do what they intended it to do. Right. And it did knock back the enemy. If they decided to ramp it up worldwide, would that be a solution to any of this or is the opposite, is it better to actually ramp up our defenses domestically and just stay the fuck away from all of these people?

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       Yeah. Um, well eventually you can only, I mean you can only do so much I think on the domestic front. Um, and then, uh, you know, if, if they gained sufficient ability and strength, we've seen that from past attacks, I think then, then they'll come after you, they'll come after us. And that's just the way I suppose that's going to work. But I don't disagree with the notion because it is hard pressed. I look, I wouldn't have stayed in Afghanistan. Frankly, I don't care whether they've increased their literacy rate by 2% are built another road or whatever. It doesn't matter. They don't, they don't know what the hell we're trying to sell them. Right. So I don't, uh, I'm not against the notion of getting out, but this one's a tough one. I guess that's what I'm saying is, is that the Syria issue is, I'm real conflicted on because of the Kurds and what they've done on our behalf in the past and how they've suffered and knowing, uh, going years and years back, you know, having dealt with that issue, uh, two and a half decades ago, a long time ago with the Turks and the Kurds, knowing how vicious that could be a, and I don't trust her to want as far as I could throw him on a window.

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       So, you know, I think there's a problem there that we need to, we need to make sure we've talked through thoroughly before we just say, sure, let's get them out of there. You know, what the hell, you know, we shouldn't have them there. And we shouldn't be there, but like everything else, so it's, it's, it's complicated. You would like to think that what they're having conversations like this up on Capitol Hill, you know, between the, the parties, uh, Republicans or the Dems, but I don't think they are,

Speaker 2:          00:31:23       that's what was concerning me. What concerns me is, especially a guy like trump, if trump is the guy who was decided we're going to pull out a Syria, like, wow, how does he have enough time to carefully consider that as well as all the other things that are on his plate. And when someone runs for president, save someone's campaigning and they say, you know what, I support a non interventional as foreign policy. I'm going to get us out of these, these wars. I'm going to get there doing this based on a limited amount of information. Like it's not like the CIA or the FBI or anybody briefs them as they're running for president. They don't have clearance. Right, right,

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       right. Until you become the party nominee, right.

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       When you're the party nominee, then do you get a discussion?

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       Get you get some access, right. It's not your stone out the president. Right. But you are given some ability to get a more intensive briefings. Yeah. Yeah. But it's not, it's not to the degree that the president,

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       so someone like Hillary, she was already secretary of State Charlie. She already knew pretty much

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       these things. Yeah. Yeah. She had, yeah. She, she was very switched on, very informed. She would just an awful candidate. Yeah. Sorry. Um, I, you know, so I think that um, look, I, there's certain things that this administration is doing foreign policy wise that I think are good. It makes sense. Um, there were other things that I think, you know, you just leave you scratching your head. Um, but that's like every administration. I guess my point is we've gotten away from that ability, right. I have conversations, I go out to dinner with folks that, you know, on the, on the, on the hard left and when you talk to them, they fully believe, fully believe that president trump is a Russian puppet, a wedding asset of Putin who is just doing Putin's bidding. And they honestly honestly believe that and nothing is going to shift them off that position too.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       When you have a, you know, that sort of frame of reference, you don't have the ability to look at anything rationally and say, yeah, okay, I like this policy related to China. It's about time we call them out and say that you obviously have not been a fair trading partner. That's something that every administration has agreed to but has never done anything about. So you would think that everybody will be able to say, hmm, makes sense. Yeah, I like it. Everybody should be able to say the immigration, you know, system here in the, in the states is somewhat dysfunctional. It needs fixing. Everybody's talked about that and yet they can't do it because they've got this, this mindset that, that that prevents them from having any sort of conversation, any sort of rational discussion that could lead to some compromise that could then advance the ball and make this government more functional. So,

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       so where we're at right now is, uh, today is day, what are the shutdown? 26th I think that would just be so 800,000 American workers that work for the government are not getting paid. So there are a month out many of these people paycheck to paycheck. They don't have medical necessities, they don't have food. People are happening to our rationale off their, their, their insulin. If they're diabetic. I mean I'm hearing these horror horror stories, the lines at the airport or around the fucking block. It's, it's chaos. And it seems like there's no end in sight. And it seems like trump has just content to, to sell, hold this position. Well, I think both sides are content to hold their position. That seems fucking crazy to me. It is crazy. It's absolutely crazy. If you think about it. And it's not just 800,000 I don't know the exact numbers, but think about all the, the contractors, I think when all the government contractors, right, I stay in, I don't think they're good

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       paid. Yeah. Right. And so this has, and, and you know, the administration has admitted that, look, we initially underestimated the impact of, of a longer term shutdown. And so they understand that. And the Democrats, you know, talk about it every minute about how this is a terrible crisis. And so you would think that if both sides feel that way, uh, then get something done and looked at the Democrats that they've approved in the past, recent past, many of these Democrats voted for fencing barriers, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. But we're lost in semantics and because the president's so hated by this, you know, this, this, this group that, you know, they've seized on this term wall. If he had started his campaign by saying we need to improve our border security and, uh, find fixes to an immigration system that is both fair and secure and efficient. If he had gone with that, it's a word he bumper sticker. But if he had gone with that and we'd have a different conversation right now, we would, but maybe would have a different president as well. Yeah. That's okay. That's a good point.

Speaker 3:          00:36:12       There's something about that build that wall that's like the dopes. We're like, Whoa, get it John. It's a wall. Still simple. Build a wall. Oh yeah. Look her castle build a wall. It seems so, uh, it's, it's such a visual.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       No, you're right. That's, and that's, you know, that's where I miss out. I, I'm way off on the, in terms of being clever about politics, but I,

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       well, how to rope in rubes. Yeah, I should, I should get better at that. But he's got that down boy. I didn't even know the people that voted for him. The people that are like real mag supporters, I didn't even know they existed in the numbers. They exist. It's like he uncovered a rock. Like you flipped a rock over and there was an ant colony of rubes in there. And just the sheer numbers, it's like, whoa, there's the top patio. Right. It's a mixed bag.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       You've got a lot of people very, you know, cause it's, I, I don't buy the idea that it's all just a bunch of crackers or a bunch of idiots. There's a, it's a, it's a, it's a real range of people. There's, there's that group of people that were just tired of being told they're idiots and they came out in force. Right. You can't tell, you can't talk down to people. This is for the Democrats. You can't keep talking down to people and expect at some point, then I can punch in the nose.

Speaker 3:          00:37:26       That's right. Well, they're still doing that now. And there's still a there, there, there was some congressmen recently that was talked about all the people that supported trump and he was talking about them all being losers and alcoholics and illiterate. And I'm like, man, you're talking about half the country, right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       No lesson learned, right? No, absolutely. No self awareness. And uh, and that's, you know, that's the story of, of, you know, every election I think going forward is, you know, you've, you've got the urban centers and you've got everybody else and everybody else feels as if they're getting kicked in the ass. And so I, but, but yeah, at the same time, you think, look, we should be able to do better. We should. I, again, certain policies that they've got great, but every day, another tweet that seems a little dysfunctional every day, you know, some misstep every day, some self inflicted wound, um, shouldn't happen. Not in a country. This size, not, not where we've got this much talent and skill and capability. So I don't know what 20 is going to bring, but it's, we got to, we're in for a hell of a ride between, um, you know, look at all the shit that's happening.

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       Yeah. This seems like it might be one of the bigger moves on the chessboard though. This government shutdown, like how this gets resolved one way or another and who comes out, at least the, the visual is the optics are that they're the winner. Yeah. That's, it seems very critical because if the Democrats win and somehow or another he abandons his idea for a wall, abandons the billions of dollars that he's been asking for for this wall that gives them momentum. We kicked his ass with that wall and we're going to kick his ass and 20, 20

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       exactly what they're thinking. That is, that is exactly what they're discussing in the war room when Nancy Pelosi keeps them all in lockstep and she's done a good job so far of keeping the dams in line. Um, and that's why they wanted her back in, at least the old guard wanted it back in because that's what she does. Well, aside from fundraising, so I, you know, I have a feeling that, look, he's asking for whatever, five point $7 billion in the scheme of things. That's a drop in the bucket and Schumer and Pelosi in a wide variety of other people, including the previous president and all voted in the past for additional funding for border security, including fencing and barriers. But they aren't, they're not going to budge off of this. So what the hell does that mean? Does that mean he's, he's being pushed into a corner where he has no option but to declare a national emergency and use funds elsewhere so that he can say, I finally got it done and looked at demos, didn't do anything. Uh, who knows? But you're, I think you're absolutely right. Whoever's perceived as the winner out of this, you know, ridiculous situation. Uh, yeah, they're going to beat that drum all the way to 2020.

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       One of the things they've been saying too about the wall is that they want to keep drugs from coming in, uh, illegal drugs. But from this El Chapo trial, we're learning how the biggest drug dealer in Mexico got his drugs and they didn't use, they didn't get it through the wall. They brought it in through mostly boats.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       Yeah. It's usually not, um, just meals, you know, individuals carton into cross some, you know, broken part of the, of the border. They brought it

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       cars in hidden compartments. They brought it in through boats. I mean, they're, they're, you know, they basically have some people spilling the beans as to how the exact operation was, was functional and it didn't seem to involve people carrying it over the border on backpack.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       Now when it goes months, uh, El Chapo is a lieutenants, is a, as a cooperating witness and he's now, he's now claiming that the former president of Mexico and UNESCO was given $100 million at the outset of his term, I think it was 2012 when he started as president. So when he was president lacked, he'd already won. But he had his wedding to take the seat. According to this, this Colombian trafficker who was working with Guzman with chapel, a pinion eto reached out to him, possibly there was campaign manager. However, the story goes, my friend and he, and he asked for 250 million and chapel, you know, came back with a negotiated position. It says 100 million, which was then according to this, again, the guy's a Colombian trafficker. It, you know, how legitimate is he, you know, uh, then, you know, the money was transferred to opinion at tdot. Uh, and you know, opinion at all. Those people are saying, that's ridiculous. Look, we were the ones who tracked him down, you know, even though we escaped, you know, 48 times or whatever, he escaped. And, uh, but there's always been this, this talk about how chopos arrests were orchestrated, right? But, and that, so that the, the, the military, the police were involved somehow that there was a coordinated effort. And, uh, there's always been that underlying rumor, you know, is it possible anything's possible.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       But if he did get $100 million, you would think El Chapo would be free. Jesus Christ if $100 million and get your free. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       Right. Yeah, I know. And you would, yeah. You would assume that, you know, what's the upside for Chapo to, to not talk about it now. Right. Um, but uh, you know, who knows?

Speaker 3:          00:42:30       It's, it's a precedent to mean where's he doesn't have tax returns. They could look at, it seems like a lot of cash.

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       Hey, moved it. Just moved it off shore immediately. Apparently it was according to this witness or to this cooperating witness, the money was delivered. Uh, this may be the part of the story that doesn't hold up. It was delivered to his campaign plane or something in his campaign manager took control of it and then they whisked it away.

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       What are they going to know? Hole in the ground somewhere. It takes out a little at a time. Keep everybody on that hush hush. I was looking at that. What's that crazy lady's name? Laura loomer, the lady Nancy Pelosi's fence. She, uh, camped out on her, her yard. You know what made me think like, how fucks Nancy Pelosi, you own that house. Where's she getting all that cash? Yeah. What's her net worth now? A couple of hundred million. Really? I forget if I mean to do what she in business. She came from a hardcore political family and Baltimore I think, and there's so much dirty money she's been doing. She's 100 million. I was waiting on us. She's worth 100 million estimated, but that's like, I don't know if it's a one of those online at work. Where does she get her money from? Oh, you gotta be Shit. You know what? Maybe she's good at. Just scrounge Jamie keeping her a per diem. Yeah, that's what I mean. What is the, what's her national set annual salary? Well, she just started getting it for this job. Wouldn't it be a 450 grams?

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Wow. No, no, that's, that's the net worth of five. Which net worth or a median net worth now? This person's okay. Congress person. So it can't be anything higher than an sis something. So it's probably not more than a hundred

Speaker 3:          00:44:15       it's all her good work. She did with the Clinton Foundation. Oh, speaker of the house gets (220) 300-0200 grand. She's worth $100 million. What in the holy fuck is that? How has that, and she does have a big wall around it. Please. Yeah. Not enough to keep. Laura loomer

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       is not an athlete. Steve's right over that son of a mess. It's not like she's a park core athlete. Fuck. Did she get over that? I show up with some, uh, illegals, illegal immigrants or whatever, undocumented workers, whatever issues. She changed herself to twitter. I know she did that to that broad. That's right. She's going hard for attention. It's, it's very interesting when these, uh, these people just try so hard to make it into the news. Well, they're looking for a contributor slot. They're looking for on one network or another. I think that's what they're doing. You have to nowadays, I think that that, I think, at least my theory is anyway, if you want to be a paid contributor for a network, no, it doesn't matter which network. You'll got to stake out a position. Uh, that involves some crazy, right? You've got to be like you how they get be all in for president trump or you gotta be all out if you, if you live in the center, that ain't happening.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Right? Nobody wants to hear from anybody in the middle because that Shit's not picking up the ratings at all. So no one wants reasonable middle right now? No. No. The only time that I think reasonable, middle, whatever workout as if the two ends are so fucked up and they're fighting so hard on the opposite ends. Like someone's like, God, surely it's got to be a reasonable middle and then someone comes along. It's almost like the people gotta be screaming for it, but right now it doesn't seem like people are screaming for no sensible centrist position. It's like a world war one trench warfare, right. I mean that's, that's the way it is with the government shut down right now and I'll close. He's sitting over here in the mud and president trump's sitting over here in the mud and nobody's given any ground and they're just, they're just occasionally taking a shot at each other.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       Throwing a hand grenade and nobody is making any, any movement. So I, you know, again, how do they shut the, or how do they stop the shutdown? You can't, if you're not talking, if you're not, if there's, if there's no effort, it's not going to happen. So everybody's looking at this right now and thinking, you know, where's it go? It's affecting the markets. It makes us look like morons. Uh, I mean, not that others aren't. I mean, look at, look at Britain, right? With the brexit thing. Look at France with the yellow vests. Look at the, you know, Germany's having a tissue. So, Eh, you know, everybody's having some, some, some problems, but you know, we didn't need to add to the noise. John Stossel had an interesting video that he put out where he's saying, what this does actually highlight is that there's a lot of things that the government does.

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       It really should probably be privatized and we wouldn't have these issues. Does that, I mean, it kind of made sense to me, but I don't know a lot. Yeah, no, I, I'm, I'm a small government person. At the end of the day, I think, you know, there's certain things that we need to rely on the government for a, and one of them would be of course, national security, terrific. You know, collection of federal taxes. Okay, fine that day they're going to do that regardless. Uh, but otherwise just stand on my kitchen. Right, right. Don't, don't, you know, and so, and that's why I've always been surprised me mean the Republican's problem I got with them is, you know, you can't sit around and argue for small government and then try to tell people what to do with their bodies or who can get married and who can't get married. Who the fuck cares?

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       I right. Just don't, don't hurt people. Be a good person. Get on with it. I don't need to celebrate your lifestyle, but just do it. I really don't care. I don't expect you to care about my lifestyle. I don't care about yours. But the Republicans have always stuck their nose in this and you can't, you can't make that argument for, for wanting small government. And if you just want to step into people's bedrooms all the time, it doesn't make any sense. And I think the only reason why they do it is because it gets people excited that they get to run to, to, to vote for them. I think when they take these positions, it's not like these are really having an effect on their lives or at some moral stand that they must take because God wants them to do it. I think they do it because they think that it's going to get, it's going to shift the pole one way or another.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       Yeah. And it's going to get people excited about them possibly making some sort of a difference that they feel is going to significantly affect their position. But do you ever get to the point, I mean, I don't know whether that's going to happen, but you would think that you've got the people on the hard right and the hard left, they're not going to shift. Right. That's not going to happen. You're not going to move those people. So like everybody always talks about decisions are made by that small group in the center. So at what point did the group in the center find it? Put their hands up and go, you guys are all fucked up. Right. How about a third party that's legitimate, not a libertarian party because that's right. It hasn't been working out. Um, but something that creates a little bit of a different dynamic and we're never going to get term limits.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       So that's, you know, tilting at windmills, but maybe, you know, maybe we get that multiparty thing go on that. Ha again. Okay. It's pie in the sky. Well, crap. Closest we ever got to it was Ross Perot, right? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. And he was, so, it was a piece of work, but when he took out a whole, he took a block of time, I believe it was a half an hour on national television. He bought the time to explain how you're getting fucked. Yeah. And explained taxes and explain all these different things. And people are like, wait, what? That's how it works. It's good tv. If you can go back and find it. It's, it's Ross Perot was good tv. I'll show you what I'm doing here. Well. Yeah, I see. That's all that's all fucked up. And here's where again, fuck yeah. A shit. Hey, we talked about, remember the last time we talked about Huawei?

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       Yes. And it hasn't gone away. No, it hasn't gotten the way sees good. Someone just got arrested yesterday. Two people, two people. Uh, so, uh, so backstory, fascinating. This is fascinating. So I, this is, this is an area I could definitely disappear down to Chinese espionage, right? They go on forever. Uh, once again I say, you know, I talk about are there certain things that the current administration is doing that I like? One of them is the way that they're dealing with China right now. And yes, the trade issue is buffeting the market somewhat and causing some instability. But again, previous administration, the Bush administration clinic, lots of, lots of prep from former presidents. They all acknowledged that China pub privately was not a fair trading partner. This administration's at least trying to call them out and calling them out on the, on the, in the cyber issue too, uh, on their, on their theft of intellectual property.

Speaker 1:          00:50:35       So anyway, wowway, um, supposedly owned by the founder and however many employees, you know, I think Huawei is by the way, uh, the number one telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world. And they're the number two seller of smartphones, right? They, they're, they're, they're a bigger seller of smartphones and apple. So at Samsung, Huawei, apple, uh, for this. And so supposedly the company's owned by the founder and his daughter is the chief operating officer, chief financial officer, one of those. She was arrested up in Canada, um, and she was arrested at the request of the u s she's up there on bail right now, waiting extradition hearing. And the reason was because supposedly she lied about wally's dealings with Iran and they were busting sanctions by dealing and providing certain types of equipment to Iran. Now, uh, this, this, this past week we've had a hallway employee who's now been fired by Huawei in Poland, uh, arrested for espionage.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       And along with him is a member of the Polish intelligence service, right. Who, uh, retired now and was now working for a French telecommunications company, but was arrested also for a espionage related to a and unrelated to this individual who up until just recently it was working for wallet, Huawei Claims Innocence and says, well, we have no idea. And the founder just came out and gave this big speech and said, I would never let the Chinese authorities tell me what to do. And now we'd certainly never spy on anybody using quallies capabilities and technology. And people are probably thinking, what the fuck are you talking about? This for? A Huawei embeds their telecommunications equipment throughout the world, right? So it's in, uh, uh, our allies, uh, military operations, which then are connected to ours, right. In terms of communications and transfer of intelligence and information. Um, they're everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       And they chose Poland. They've been in Poland for about 10 years. Poland is a very important NATO ally. So I, I'm, I'm taking a long time, I realized to explain this, but what I'm trying to say is nothing happens by happenstance, right? The Chinese don't operate that way. So the Chinese authorities sometime ago, years ago, looked at it and went, yeah, this makes sense, right? We've got Huawei, which by the way, the founder is a former military, uh, people's Liberation Army engineer. Um, he, um, they, they, they looked at this and they thought Poland, uh, that would be a good beachhead for us, right? Because there are a key element of NATO, so let's go to Poland. So they started a burrowing into Poland striking deals and you know, they're basically the most important foreign relationship now a corporation inside a Poland and they're fully embedded and they've had access to at this point to NATO communications.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       And now the arrest of these two individuals. And people will still, despite this and despite their past, despite their, their, their theft of information from everybody from us steel to, uh, to Alcoa, to Lockheed Martin to dupont, all the times that they've been stealing information, people will still go wide. You know, I don't, I don't believe it. I don't, that doesn't make any sense. I don't see why the Chinese would act that way. And I don't see why we're being so harsh on them. You know, this tariff thing is a bad idea. My point being, you got to call them out. They're not going to necessarily change their behavior, but you got to raise public awareness, make uh, our allies understanding where that's what we're doing right now. We're saying you've gotta, you've gotta put the brakes on this, build a firewall, use other companies, telecommunications equipment.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       Because you know, the fact that we're tied in with our allies, with Poland and with Canada and you know, that gives them access to us. So for someone on the outside, look myself was trying to look at this. And you, you say that while stealing stuff like stealing stuff from us steel, how are they doing that? Well, they, I mean the u s steel, admittedly that was, that was a pla, that was the People's Liberation Army, a third department operation against dupont and, and also against us steel and others. So that was a little bit different. I, I conflated the two. But Huawei, one of the things that they do is by having access, uh, and, and embedding their equipment in your communications infrastructure, that gives them the ability then to, uh, in, in a simple way to tap in, right? It's just a package intercept information, right?

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Basically. So you have communication. So imagine we're trading information through NATO, uh, channels, right? All they need is that one in, right? That's it. It's like everything else. It's like fishing, right? It's just like, you know, when, when hackers just an individual hacker sitting in somebody's basement, you know, he just needs that one avenue. He needs to get one s. It's just, just click on that email that gives me the pathway in. So when, when Huawei is able to embed their technology into Polish communications, and we're now connected because of our NATO alliance, that gives them access to us, France, whomever. And you know, it's not as if it just happened. It's not as if Huawei from a business perspective says, you know, I bet we could sell some of our equipment and Poland. Wouldn't that be good? The guy who was arrested, the Huawei person who was arrested was responsible for, uh, the provision of telecommunication equipment to government facilities. That was his job. And the guy, the Polish guy, one of his last jobs with the Intel service was, uh, communications.

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       So I guess what I'm saying is none of this shit happens in a bubble and it's all, it's all very well mapped out. The Chinese have a very long view on things and they are very good at developing operations like this and so they've been very successful. Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll see. But it's, it's, I'm glad that the current administration at least is calling them out. I don't believe it's necessarily going to change their behavior, you know, and we'll, we'll probably get some sort of deal where they'll claim to look just a couple of years ago, they agree with President Obama to stop their cyber shenanigans and they didn't, so they just changed the way that they did it. You know, that's, that's the world we live in. But I think it is important to make a stand. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       Yeah. There's some of that the tech people are saying that they think it's preposterous. When they were talking about the ban on android phones, some of the tech people say that doesn't make any sense, but what you're saying is it goes far beyond the actual phones itself. And it's really the, the mission of the actual company itself.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       Yeah. I'm saying that, that there is no way that Huawei and, and other important Chinese companies are solely privately owned and, or have the ability to tell the Chinese authorities that they will not spy on their behalf. It just not happen. It's just not happening. You have to, you have to go a long ways, uh, to come up with that sort of naive viewpoint that says that a Chinese company is going to put its foot down until present g absolutely not. We will not do anything to harm another nation's country or a company horse. Shit they've spent, they've spent generations now decades, uh, jumpstarting their industry and moving up the food chain on the global economy by hoovering up everything possible out there. So if someone like a

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       tech wizard got ahold of one of their routers, can have they been able to detect something in there that doesn't belong or some sort of a back door or some sort of a way that they could tap in. It's like if you were, you know, you were apple and you were sending data to Raytheon or whatever and you're going back and forth, they could tap in through that as it had been proven that there's a device like that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       Yeah. A former NSA director Mcconnell back in, uh, 2015, I think early 2015 came out and NSA came out with an official statement and it said every major US corporation of any consequence has been, um, uh, attacked and exploited by Chinese. And we have never, ever not found Chinese malware within their systems. Wow. That was ever four years

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       malware being software. Right, right, right. Is there anything in the hardware itself?

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       Uh, yes. In, in, in a sense that, um, yes, in, in a sense of like, I'm trying to remember the name of it, but not doing very good job. Um, if you have, uh, access to or understanding of physical hardware, then you can, uh, affect easier, you can affect a physical control of systems. Right. So, uh, stuxnet, remember, I don't know if you remember, stuxnet was exactly, it was an attack on Iran. Um, the shut down their nuclear program, right, exactly. To, uh, essentially what it did was it took over control of some centrifuges over spawn. Them they heated about broke and it was a virus. And it was, it was an piece of software that was able to impact the, the, you know, physical equipment. Uh, it took control of those systems, um, because in part, uh, whoever perpetrated it had much better understanding of that gear.

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       Right. Or had access to that gear. And that's a, that's an important part of, of this. And it's happened several times since then. And I'm, you know, I'm not disclosing anything because it's all it's been written about. I'm sure it'll be a movie at some point, but, um, that is, uh, that's a concern. I'm far more worried about a company like Huawei with, it's a integration into, uh, allied, um, our allies, uh, telecommunications systems than I am about sort of the individual sale of phones. And you know what that means, that look, you know, Amazon and all the others are gathering more data on the average American then, you know, uh, US government or anybody else's government is doing it at this point. Let me ask you this, cause this is something that just came up and we were trying to figure out with nonsense or not.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       My friend Adam was here the other day and we're talking about Toyota trucks and he didn't Google Toyota trucks just discussing it. And he said since then his mentions had been filled with these little advertisements for Toyota trucks. How's that work? Um, you know how you talk to Siri? Yes. Yeah. Um, it, it's, it's simple voice rec recognition. It, it's, it's a carry over from the old days of you know, optical readers and how, you know, we all thought it was incredible that you could take a piece of paper, put into a system and it would like take that information that was on that piece of paper and now it was on a database that you could access and manipulate. And so, you know, voice recognition is no different in the sense that, so if, if, if for example, if I had this switched on and it happens to people on the, I'm sure all the time walking around their house, they'll say something and all of a sudden Alexa will come on and go, oh, I couldn't find a result for that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       But do you want to listen to Ella Fitzgerald or whatever? It's always on. It's always listening, right? And you can do that with anything like this TV right here if you want it to. A few, if I knew that TV was going to go into the office of the deputy foreign minister of a country hostile to our interests, I could turn that thing into a receiver, obviously. Right. And if I could get my hands on that before delivery, that's a wonderful thing. Now I've got this in there and it's like the old days when you would have to go in on a, an entry operation and you know, you silent drills and put a, uh, you know, a device in the wall. Now, you know, we've delivered a TV now I get, I get it, you know, video too. Hey, good for me. So that Shit's always on, you know, in a sense.

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       And um, so a regular phone that you get if you just buy an iphone and you have Siri turned on so we could say, Hey Siri, and it turns on that phone is always listening to you. Well, uh, then now we're getting in over my head, but it could be, I mean, it is, is it possible? Is it, is it capable of doing that? Yes. Could you do that? Um, uh, as an intentional operation? Sure. Um, is it happening because apple wants to do it and they want to get better understanding of consumer preferences and things? I have no idea that that's above my pay grade. But I will say from an operational perspective, sure. Yeah. You from an operational perspective, right. But like it would kind of be scandalous if we found out that apple is listen to everything that you say and then they're sending them information to these companies and then they're trying to sell you whatever you were bringing it up.

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       But it's one, it's really, if you think about it, it's only one step above what they do anyway, which is, I mean, if I go in here and I searched Toyota, right? You know, I'm an, I'm in the same situation. I'm fucking inundated with Toyota mentions right after. So, you know, it's, it's like the next iteration of that. And I suspect that people would, you know, that some folks would be outraged, but I'll bet people would just live with it. Right. We seem to be willing to give up a lot of shit, you know, as long as we don't think that governments doing it right. If it's, if it's google, if it's Google in somebody, we seem to be fine with it. But if it's like, fuck it, if it's at NSA, then now our best, but that's not who's fucking making jack off of these things.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       Right? Right. So it's Amazon, Google and all these companies that are using it to sell your data to make a lot of money. Anyway. What do you got Jamie? Centers call for investigation of T-mobile, sprint, verizon and att and t for selling location data. Phone companies know where you are. Lawmakers want them to stop selling that information until they could figure out how to tax it. That seems, what do they sell in that location? Data for? They want to know how many people are in certain areas. Is that the idea? Is that the APP is telling you where anyone could, you can buy that information and find anybody's a location. But look, they do these things now where there's a billboard, they'll put a billboard up in a, in a, in a square, right? Um, and you'll walk by and the billboard has the ability to see where the eyeballs are, right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       So you'll look and they'll say, oh yeah, it's looking at me that bill boys looking at me. So that's a success, right? I've scored a hit or a view and that was the old days. It was like, you know how you know, how many clicks or how many fields where it's got a camera. There's a, there's a ability for that billboard to sense. And again, this, I go overboard if I start talking technical and someone will call me out and say, well, that's not exactly how it works. But uh, in simplistic terms, yeah, it's a, it's an ability to monitor, um, pedestrian traffic to understand, you know, uh, people's interests and to further refine so that they can sell a shit better.

Speaker 3:          01:05:21       Mac, your outdoor advertising interactive, this is putting your phone directly up to it. This, this is like you committing that Ooh, there, but there is also what he's talking about to this, what he started with. This guy's talking about, what's his name again? Who Was it? So this you walk up to a phone that's in the photo, you hold your phone up to it, it sends a signal to your phone. It seems like it's always Samsung knows it. Only Samsung phones. Maybe just a galaxy. Add this advertisement. I have a song for you. These are galaxy ads, but if you can do a one way transaction, that transaction can be two away easily, obviously. Right. And it has to be to some degree because there has to be an exchange of, of, you know, sort of a handshake. So I didn't know that billboards are staring at you though. Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's a new, pretty crazy shit. Look, I mean, this you can tracking now understanding where people are,

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       right? As an example, uh, you know, it used to be putting a beacon, right? Investigations, you know, you put a beacon on a car, right? And you'd, and it was a little clumsy, but it got better and better as you go along. You know, now it's now it's, it's, uh, it's, it's pretty remarkable, but you can also think about the electronics that exist in a, in a current vehicle and a new vehicle. Um, you can, every one of those has a unique signature. So whether it's the tire pressure, uh, indicators, you know, how you get in your car and it says your left front tire is low. Right? Well, that's a particular signal. If I know that signal for that car, I'll bet I can find that car. Right. And it's like, it's the same with all the other electronics that exist within a vehicle. Um, or just in the shit that we carry around. They've all got some kind of signature. So I, but again, I think most people are willing to give up a surprising amount of privacy for whatever reason. Maybe because they're getting accustomed to it and they're not shocked by shooting.

Speaker 3:          01:07:05       Jamie, what were you saying today that somebody made a slip up about phone calls? That the thing you were saying about the, um, the different data that they've collected. You were just telling me before the show about the what? The some investigation. That was it that the thing that I was just talking about. We find anybody's phone. No, you were saying that through the emails and phone up phone calls and the guide fucked up by saying phone calls. I'm having a brain a he just told me before the show. But then thinking about a lot of stuff, smoking a lot of stuff. I got a lot of shit on my mind right to brain with that. Now I'm still thinking about that hallway thing we were talking about right before. If you remember it. No big deal. I think it had something to do with the Mueller investigation. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think wins that can end fuck that guy. It's just that means he would scare the shit out of me if he was looking at my life. Cause it seems like that guy takes his time, but about two years of worth of time. One thing I've got, I remember it was the national security adviser on CNN last night. He was talking about Bill Barr is,

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       um, the access to information he would already have and, and it'll also be gaining, I guess by becoming the Attorney General. They were discussing whether he will, um, uh, to share all the information coming out. They wanted them to commit to doing that. And it was just sort of saying, I can't commit because I don't know what's in there yet. And they were just sort of like giving their both their sides. I'm like, well, he could know what he would know, what he will know. That's all I was sort of saying. And he sorta cut himself off of sharing about how much information this guy might have access to. It sort of, it seemed like it. And he was, the former national security advisor, I believe was all that was.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       So one of the things that everybody was scared of was that the NSA was building some gigantic place somewhere outside of Salt Lake where they would store every single phone call that you ever made, every single email. Yeah. Uh, it, that's, that there was that whole stink at one point about, uh, what they were actually holding on to, right. The collection of information and there was some misreporting about how they've actually got your phone calls, what would, they've got us, they've got number and duration of call. Right? I mean that's, that's the key pieces of information that they've got. Um, could they at some point, you know, suddenly decide you're a target of interest and so we won't, we will start collecting on your calls. Yeah. But was the NSA gathering everybody's phone conversations now, but it used to be a thing that you would have to wire tap somebody.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       Like if you're going after the mob, they had a dad install a bug, but they don't have to do that anymore. No. Oh No, no, no, no. I mean tech technology now it's, I mean, I remember the old days of, of, uh, operations, right? I mean, if we wanted to do a, we're overseas, it's compounded incredibly, it's May really difficult to do observation posts and listening posts and everything overseas, right. Cause it's not your turf. And so you've got to come up with a, I'm an air tight plan, but it was the same way. You still had to get physical access, right to phone lines. He had that yet the clip off and you had to, you know, then you have to figure out where am I putting the, the gear, where am I going to put the batteries? How am I going to store this shit?

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       And then you got listened to it, right? And you've got to, you start, what happens is it starts collecting like this. You start getting mountains, so tapes, right? And you're not getting it real time, which is a problem. But nowadays, no, it's entirely different. Um, but I think, you know, if, if we, if we look at today's concerns, right? If we look at what are people worried about, what should they be worried about? Um, I know that privacy always comes up. People always talk about it. And I guess I keep going back to my same point, which was I, I don't see people with pitchforks and the torches going down a complainant, Jeff Bezos that, you know, Amazon's collecting massive amounts of data or you know, t mobile and sprint and all of these are our mapping our locations as we move around. I just don't see it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       I mean, that probably raised nobody's interest for the most part. You know, that article that you just pulled up. Um, and I, you know, I guess in part it's because we become kind of used to it become accustomed to it, so, so fine. But, you know, what should we be worried about? Well, I'll tell you what we should boy up mostly is a state sponsored activity by countries whose interests almost never aligned with ours now would include, China certainly includes Russia, was Iran. The, the shit that they're doing. China has a policy, um, information domination, right? Which means they've determined that the next war, the next modern large scale war is going to be one by whoever has control over information. So where are they putting all their resources? China knows that they're not going to build a military that's going to be able to reach around the globe for the most part.

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       Although they're, you know, they're beefing up their resources. What are they doing? It's cyber and it's space, right? So I know a lot of people were, were kicking the president in the ass and laughing about space for us because it is funny, right? But the uniforms would be amazing. But they, they talk about this, but China honestly believes and it's putting their resources into cyber and to space. And what does that mean, wolf? They're anti satellite technology that they've been developing and working on and continue to work on. The whole point of that is to take control of communications and surveillance abilities, whether it's ours or allies in the event of something major that happens. So they would have the ability to shut off our silence. No, and if you do that, then what does that mean? Well, it means you're blind, right? And will suddenly walking around with compasses and maps, you know, trying to shoot an asthma, then figuring out where the hell, you know, the target is.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       So China is currently developing that or they have developed something that they're working on it now. Yeah. They're working on now developed. They developed some of it. They're, they're working to get the next generation. It's like every nation that has the resources and ability understands that and is doing the same. It's not like we're not, what is their excuse was they should, but they don't have an excuse. They just, they understand they have the right to do it. I mean, it's not like they, they, you know, right. As long as it don't use it right. And in an illegal way, they have the right to develop the tech. It's like there's no treaty that says you can't develop anti satellite technology. Right. There's, there's, there's the start treaties. There's the nuclear, you know, conventions that we have with Russia, which isn't a whole nother interesting topic because we're now arguing with the Russians over over, uh, the, the latest nuke agreement that took place some time ago.

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       Uh, it's, uh, coming up for renewal sometime soon, your a year or two years from now. And the Russians had been cheating on a previous agreement. And so we're know now they tried to say we're cheating on the new one. And so that's an interesting thing to be watching. But the point being is that there's conventions that try to control the, the numbers for warheads or for delivery mechanisms, missiles or, or, or, uh, submarines, whatever bombers, but not for this new world. Cyberspace. The Pentagon's still trying to figure out what, uh, you know, a war, uh, means in cyberspace, right. You know, how do you respond? What do you know, what, what's the threshold, you know, and then what's an appropriate response? Um, and so, well, maybe we'll get there. Maybe we'll start having these discussions and create treaties that will allow that. But right now, from China's perspective, again, not to beat on China, but I'm much more concerned about China for our national security.

Speaker 1:          01:14:22       There are a much bigger concern than Russia is. Russia is punching above its weight and potent, you know, Putin's a Dick, no doubt about it. Right? And they've doing what they always do, which is metal and democracy. That's been their methodology for ever since they've been around. But you know that that's small potatoes. They got the GDP of a small European country, you know, and when the oil prices, you know, are in the toilet, they really are sucking wind. So yeah, we gotta be concerned with Russia and understand that their interests were never aligned with ours. You know, for the most part may be, we tried to imagine they were with Syria and isis and everything, but Russia is only interested there was maintaining their leverage and increasing it and not, not losing their military foothold there. That was their primary interest. We mirror our values and we mirror our interest on other countries.

Speaker 1:          01:15:11       And so we imagined that somehow we're all in this fight against Isis together. Oh Shit. You know, so, so yeah, China's a much bigger issue and we, and we should be focused on that and to some degree this administration is, so that's where I say, look, you can't just keep complaining and bitching and moaning because you don't like president trump. There are certain things that are going on that you should be willing to say that. Okay, that makes sense. Maybe I don't like the messenger, but that part of it makes sense. Is it his personal life? I mean it was it because of his dealings with China from the business world that he understands it better, that he's more concerned with the, the imbalance of the, the trade. I think what happened was what do, I know this is speculation, so hey, but I suspect that what happened was he came into it, um, focused on the trade imbalance.

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       Right. And as he was sitting there and talking about the trade balance, more of the conversation from the National Security Council and from the agency and others in terms of saying, well, yeah, this is part of the reason why and this is the long longterm effects of, of their theft of intellectual property. This is why in part they've been successful in these areas. So I think there was probably more and more discussion talking about, uh, their, uh, economic espionage and theft of Ip and that became then an issue for him. Um, but I think initially, and still to this day, I think the big issue is just he wants to try to create a win in terms of the trade imbalance. Russia seems to us here domestically leaks, speaking from, for myself, when, when I think about it, and I think about the, the narrative that's been sort of delivered to us said, Russia is this military danger.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       We're worried about Putin taking over other countries. We're worried about Putin's power, the way he kills dissidence, the way he kills political opponents and journalists, we think about China. And even with the walway arrests were like, Eh, no one seems to be concerned. It doesn't seem to light any bulbs over here. Now you're right. I don't know why that is, except, you know, Putin is more like a thug and he's a visual. Right, right. And also, I mean, look, I, you know, he's, he's been very clear about wanting to try to rebuild the Soviet Union. So whether it's Crimea and the annexation of that, or where they're taking over eastern Ukraine, um, you know, or, or maintaining a position at Georgia, whatever it is. Uh, you know, certainly, uh, you know, his attacks or the FSB is attacks overseas against, you know, dissidents and others. Um, yeah, he's just more in your face.

Speaker 1:          01:17:46       He's like Tony Soprano. Right, right. So you can look at that. China's always been, you know, sort of this thing, right. And she look, China's fantastic. The history is amazing. You know, the places are incredible. I think it's, you know, we should be trading with China. We should be doing a huge amount of business with China. We should clear the decks and try to agree. We can level the playing field, but we should also be pragmatic and realize what they do in terms of their theft of Ip. And so, you know, because that again, that probably won't change, but yeah, we absolutely should be dealing with China all the time. But I think that they've always kind of been viewed more in more of a sophisticated fashion, maybe because Putin has just sort of in your face. Um, and he's, you know, he's good at it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       He's very successful. He says he's a smart son of a bitch, but he's, I think he's pretty easy to read, right? He's, he's thuggish and, um, he, you know, he longs for those days of the Soviet Union. So we should understand that everything he does is because of that is because he's, he, he would love to rebuild the Soviet Union. And so we shouldn't be surprised by any sort of aggressive move that he makes against his, his neighbors. And we should always push back. Um, and to be fair, this administration, not to beat their drum, but the actions they've taken against Russia, despite the fact that you've got people calling him a puppet of Putin, how are more significant than the previous administration took? Like, what has he done the sanctions against, uh, you know, key individuals and companies within Russia as an example. Those are the toughest sanctions have been placed on Russia ever.

Speaker 1:          01:19:24       Um, the provision of weapons and a, and assistance to the Ukrainians, right? That was something the previous administration said, no, not going to do that. You know, cause we don't, we don't want any blow back. Um, that's, that's a good thing, right? That should be done. Um, pushing back against them on the, on the 2011 nuke a deal. Right. And, or sorry, on the, on the previous, on the start deal prior to the 2011 deal and calling them out and saying, look, you're cheating on this and you, you know, you gotta be held accountable. I mean, there's certain things there that, that makes sense then that don't add up if you talk to somebody who says, well, he's an absolute puppet, and you say, well, okay, he's a puppet, so why is he doing certain that seem counter to Russian interests? And they'll say, well, because he's smart and he's like, he doesn't want to get caught out.

Speaker 1:          01:20:14       I ain't see it's, he's playing, he's playing long game here, you know, and he's, and, and, and I'm thinking, okay, I, you know, maybe, maybe, who knows? But, uh, I haven't, I haven't strapped on my tin foil hat yet to get to that point. So I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, that seems like a complicated one. If they have some compromising information about them, that was always the fear, right? Is that they knew something or maybe it was business dealings. Maybe it was people peeing on him or, yeah. So I'll get that if they had, if they did not. And again, anything I can help in today's world, anything's possible. Right. And I wish we had somebody else in there who was more elegant and eloquent and sophisticated and anybody stand out? Uh, not right now. No, I don't think anybody's going to challenge it from the Republican side.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       And on the democratic side, I think they're going to get 18 to 20 you know, potential candidates and there and beat in their own. Right. So it could be a, it could be a real, you know, a slug fest and as they're trying to establish someone who's a viable candidate, kind of like what the Republicans did. Right. And we ended up with, you know, we ended up with president trump. And you know how the Democrats, if they're not careful, you can end up with the same thing. Look, they're talking about Joe Biden. I, Joe Biden's an excellent cat. Right? So 150 years old, it's 150 years old and he lost twice before. But everybody loves the person that's on the bench, right, right. Until they get in the game. And so, you know, who knows where they're going to go with that. But um, you know, could they had this idea that they've got compromising information on them?

Speaker 1:          01:21:42       Um, here's, uh, here's what I think is that if Mueller has figured this out right, and he's been quiet about it, and then the most remarkable thing about this investigation will be that nobody leaked. Right? Because you can't keep a secret in Washington. And so the fact that for two years now, we don't have like that, that, that bullet, you know, that they think they are going to come up with some point. My inclination is to think that, you know, Molly's gonna Finish this investigation issue some findings and nobody's going to be happy, right? Cause there won't be a bullet. And so the left won't be happy. The right won't be happy because he'll still be pointing out the fact that there was, you know, a lot of, you know, stupid moves on the campaigns part and that there was, uh, inappropriate activity by, you know, people like manafort and others.

Speaker 1:          01:22:32       Uh, but, uh, do I think there's gonna be some smoking gun? I don't, I don't think so because, and my reason for saying that is because I've never known Washington not be able to keep or to, to be able to keep a secret. This is the one, like, Mueller ever done one of these things before though. He seems uniquely calculated. Yeah. He's, he's done this before and um, and he has, he's like, look, he's a very smart guy and a very seasoned, a operator investigator. Uh, and he's got good people working for him and it's absolutely correct to let them go with this and just let him finish it up. Right. But when is that going to be? Who knows? Right, right. Nobody had, they've been talking about, oh, he's going to wrap it up next week, or it's going to wrap it up this week. He's going to know. He's not, you know, he'll, you know, he's thinking he's going to wrap it up. Who knows? This literally could go onto in the eye, it's going to have to end before probably end of this year. I don't think even he's gonna want to for political calculations, let it go into, to close to 20, 20 in the election. Right. So regardless, even though I don't think he's a particularly political individual, I think he's going to see the wisdom of wrapping it up before then. Um, and then letting the chips fall wherever they do.

Speaker 2:          01:23:36       What's astonishing to me is how anytime something does come out on trump, it just seems to slide right off. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       Yeah. All that is true. That is true. Because I think what's happening is they're just throwing everything out there every day. Right. And it much like, you know, our willingness to give up privacy because we keep hearing about another hack or another lake or we know that Amazon's doing this or that. I think w, you know, it's that constant drum beat and that mudslinging and I think the dems haven't done themselves any favors. So the resistance movement of what do we want to call it? Um, because I think people are just immune to it and it's hardened the trump's base to think, you know, he's under attack every minute, right. So I gotta support them harder. Um, yeah. But uh, you know, who do you think's going to end up in, in the race? I mean, who's got the best chance?

Speaker 2:          01:24:23       It's a good question. I mean, on the left hand side, the, my real fear is that Hillary is going to run again. Sorry, I almost did one of those TV spit takes. It's possible. Well, that lady is crazy. You know, one of the things that she said in one of the more recent interviews, she said, I'd like to be president. I'd like to be president. Just what do you want to put it on your resume? What the fuck does that mean? I think I could do a great job and turning this country around. I have the leadership ability to really affect a change. No, no, no. I'd like to be president,

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       Eh, I got some time I could do that. I'm scared of them. Yeah. Well, you know what, and you're right. She May, but I, I do think there's going to be so much pressure on her from the party to just say, no, you can't. I think she's going to look at that and go, I, there's no chance I can rally the apparatus around me like I did the last time. And because of that, um, because even she can't run without the machine. Right. I mean, that's it. They've got to figure that out. So

Speaker 2:          01:25:22       I just wonder if she has so many people that owe her favors and she's so deeply entrenched in the world that she could somehow, or another muster up enough support to give it one more shot. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       possible. I mean, yeah, but then you're talking about hurry it all the way to two. What to to, uh, Kamala Harris, cory booker, Tulsi Gabbert Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi.

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       Gabbard Castro is a veteran. Young makes a lot of sense. Very smart, articulate. I think she has a real legitimate chance of getting people excited about a real future. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       Yeah. I would not, uh, you know, I think it's, it's time we're close. We're getting to that point where we'll, uh, you know, we end up with a female president and hey, good for us. Right? I got no problems. You know, there's, I think it would actually, you know, I think it would turn the ship in a nice direction, right. As long as the policies are good, I don't care who it is, as long as we're not, you know, veering off into, uh, you know, sort of socialist policy, you know, land and thinking somehow we're going to all going to end up with a universal basic income. You know, I got a guy coming on and talking about that. Andrew Yang. It

Speaker 2:          01:26:31       describe universal basic income and what the benefits would be. The reason being that they're worried that automation is going to kill a gigantic percent is of jobs in manufacturing, fast food, um, medical field trucks, all these different things that universal basic income might actually be something that we need it certain point in time because so many jobs will go away and go away so rapidly. Do you think that uh, kills motivation? That's a good question. What I thought was maybe, but maybe if the motivation is not just to survive, but the motivation to succeed and do well, it would get people to do what they actually want to do for a living or chase down what they actually want to do and get them motivated to, to have a better life, not just motivated to live, follow their passion. Yes. It's, it's hard because when you give people things for nothing, right?

Speaker 2:          01:27:30       You generally do kill their motivation. I mean, you look neat. Look no further than trust fund kids. Right, right. Yeah. I guess I, that's, that's a great example. Most people would go towards, you know, welfare, but I think you're right on the other end of the spectrum. To me, trust fund kids. I've seen this list lists way they approach life, you know, they just laissez faire just, I just think that it's really hard for people to want something better when they have enough. They're good. Yeah. Everything's good. They don't have to do anything. And you don't have to motivate yourself to do anything to get that money.

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       Mani. Yeah. I don't understand the, the, the, the, the logistics behind it, you know, in terms of how it gets paid, the actual numbers. But the, the part that I, that worries me is this issue of, of motivation and ensuring that then, you know, everybody's willing to unmask the sofa and, and do something productive. Right. And it's not just, we can't be like a, a nation of people following their passion because their passion is, is completely unpredicted or may make making dream catchers, pottery loved pottery month. Dream catchers too. I got one in my truck. Um, and really what are you doing? I got a hula girl on the dashboard of my truck, which is getting a new engine, by the way. Even as we speak, I had to turn off the wagon here. It's a grand wagon here. The old wood paneled Greg Wagon here. Yeah. The year that they made at

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       91 and still drive one of those things. Yeah, absolutely. It's a great car and uh, and but I have to, I had to rebuild the engine some that works good. Like a new one because this thing is great. Look that the kids can climb all around it. I can drive to the drive in theater and they can, they put a back the hatchback and they'd just sit there and I do live in the 50s actually. Yeah. Yeah. That with the little clip on speaker that can bend. It is fantastic. You have not a long time. Is that what you have? I got the blue. It's blue with a sand interior fucking wizard that decided to go with those wood panels on the side. It's fantastic. And then how did that, how did everybody wake up and decide that that sucks? Yeah. I have a while. I tell you something. It's a great suit, great vehicle. And it's also, nobody gets anywhere near me cause that fucker is made of of all steel. Yeah, they're heavy. And that son of a bitch will plow through anything, but it's just a great car and the dog loves it. And I can fit all the gloves and the fishing. Yeah, you put the fishing poles in there. It's all good.

Speaker 3:          01:30:17       No, you're kidding. No, I'm lucky if I, if I have breaks, but don't you want to call with brakes? Eh, Eh, it's big enough when you work in security for too long, you're like, there's no security now. Fuck Outta here. Just nice seat belt doesn't work. But I've been meaning to fix it. You have a seatbelt. The receiver is broken and we're clicks in. Yeah, exactly. And I've been meaning to get that fixed cars and being, when you don't have your seat belt on and like good luck. No, it doesn't talk to me at all. And you know what else? Nobody can track me in that car that, you know what attracted me and that son of a bitch. So you just leave your phone at home and you're fucking, you're good. I'm good man. I'm all pick red boner. I met a burner. Hello phone.

Speaker 3:          01:31:08       I can fit my boner in there too, which is Kinda just burner phones come with boners Trenton, a burner phone barter. You got a boner and then, yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a great, it's a great vehicle. Like I said, my kids love it. Mugsy and scooter and Sluggo juicing that you got it because you can't track you with it. And also they can't. Let me ask you this. This is a tough one. I want to ask you to conspiracy one's, but this one's a tough one. Michael Hastings, you know his case. Do you know story? Yeah. Yeah. What do you think happened there? Well, let's, let's explain what happened. What, who he was, he was a journalist. He was embedded in, was it in Iraq during the, during the war. He was writing a story for the role for rolling stone. And he was writing about which general was it?

Speaker 2:          01:32:02       Crystal. Crystal, crystal and stay on the crystal. Yeah. So he wrote this story and apparently while this happened, the Iceland volcano went off. So they, they suspended air travel. So he was stuck there far longer than he was supposed to be and people got comfortable with this guy being around. Right. And so they behave the way they behave. They made some jokes about things. He apparently made some jokes about Obama. This guy put this, Michael Hastings put all this stuff and rolling stone. Um, it wound up being a huge scandal. Mcchrystal had to step down and there was a lot of people that hated that guy and a lot of people loved mcchrystal and he was a highly respected general. Yeah, absolutely. He had a step down from his position and next thing you know, x amount of time later, this guy drives his car 150 miles an hour into a tree.

Speaker 2:          01:33:00       It blows up. The engine goes flying the whole deal. Uh, the conspiracy theory was that there was a way, cause he had a brand new Mercedes, there was a way that they could take over the controls of your vehicle, the acceleration, the braking steering, and they could do all this remotely. If they put something in your car, like we were talking about, if you could get ahold of this television, you could turn that television to a receiver. Right. Do you think that is possible that someone could have gotten a hold of his car and made him suicide himself?

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       Uh, two parts to it. Uh, one is, is it possible that you can take control of a vehicle, a modern vehicle? Yes. Not, not that, not that, not the woody, not the woody. Yes, we call it. Um, but, uh, uh, so yes, it's absolutely possible that you can take those is no two ways about acceleration, steering everything. Yeah. If you've got, and, and, um, and I mean, think about people should think about it. They think about the, the Onstar or think about the ability for your car to send data, uh, to the, to the vehicle manufacturer. Right? Right. To tell them, you know, what's going on with your vehicle. Um, that's a, that's a handshake operation, right? Once you do that, that that means there's an exchange of information. What does that mean? Well, that means you can access, can you access that information? Sure, of course you can.

Speaker 1:          01:34:21       Does that mean you can then take physical controls short? That's it's, it's an, it's just another iteration of the exchange of information, right? Software can take control of physical systems so that, yeah. So the first part is yes. Is it possible that that car could have been taken over shore? Uh, do I think that's what happened? I have no idea. I really don't. But, um, it's, it's, it's certainly a possibility. I mean, when I hear people talk about, you know, certain conspiracy theories, I looked at it and go, there's just no fucking way that can happen. Like what one, one d say no fucking one. Uh, actually I have a hard

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       time thinking of one. Um, uh, I liked it, the theory that with every burner phone you get a boner. That's, I just, I can't imagine that could happen. But it sounds good. I think I'm good. Misunderstood. What I'm saying is you get the burner phone because you have a boner already trying to get rid of it. Oh, I didn't see the owner. Yeah, I got the priorities. So until you secretary to get a burner phone to meet her at the old hotel, how the, Oh man. Just like Jeff Bezos and he's $70 billion down the down the toilet. Oh yeah. That's, how did they get his text messages? That's a good fucking cybersecurity. Yeah. They got his text messages to his mistress. Yeah. Who knows how that happened. So it, unless maybe she maybe meaning Mrs Bayzos, maybe she hired a, uh, you know, some dodgy investigator to come up with that.

Speaker 3:          01:35:56       Well, I noticed that it was an iphone. No visit an iphone. And he had an I pad and she had the password to the IPAD. She could get all those messages. Yeah. Yeah. But it's a, that, what do they live? They live in Washington, right? State of Washington. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I guess that's communal, I think. Yeah. She, well, they started the company together. She helped him. Yeah. So that's a wrap. But you know, whatever, 70 billion. Yeah. It's rough to give away 70 billion. But let's be completely honest. If you're, if you have $70 billion and you notice whether you have 70 or a hundred. Yeah, yeah. All kind of, you might be an asshole. You know the difference? Yeah. How the fuck do you even feel it? If she takes 70 billion? This is lifestyle change cause you have to get rid of one of his jets.

Speaker 3:          01:36:45       Like what happened? He's got to give up cable. Does he have a bionic smaller ring for his mistress? But she's not even a is apparently they were separated. We're not going to get his girlfriend. Oh Geez. Really? Yeah. Okay. So they're saying he was cheating on his wife, but he wasn't really because they were separated. Yeah. You would think that that's fair game, but I'm sure that it's anyway, it's going to be costly. She's so hot. Oh, she's so cool. Mrs Bayzos or one? The new one. Oh. Oh, I think they're friends. I think she and Mrs Bayzos. We're friends. They're friends. Yeah. It's all going to be very amicable. They fucking circle. They know what they're doing. Coyotes, man doing, they just take their time, their patient wolves. I think he's, I think it's, it's interesting because I think he, um, he's changed if you look at Bayzos over the years, right?

Speaker 3:          01:37:33       Yeah. And you look at the way he is now just as physical appearance. You can just, you can just tell that that money, yeah. Money probably hired a personal trainer too, but he's got the money, but he's gonna probably have to let them go now. Can't afford that shit anymore. I lost 70 billion. Well, the smart thing would honestly be to, for him to give away half. Don't even duke it out with lawyers. I don't take too long. But he, no prenup agreement. There's no prenuptial Koala. It's understood that Ms. Sanchez has sent text messages to a friend showing off for a new relationship with the billionaire and the friends sent them to the inquirer. Water con you fucking dumb ass. Oh Damn. She's hot though. She looks like that actress. I can't remember her name. Yeah, the one on modern family. Yes. Yeah, I could see what she sees at him. He's like, yeah, he's, he's uh, you know, it's the thin neck in relationship with the large head chicks. Love that. Jeff, you're still, he loved that look. Yes. Such a man. And he sent her like naked selfies too. Ah, no, not him too.

Speaker 3:          01:38:37       I think you did. What is that? You don't, why did dudes think that women want to look at their junk? Right? I mean, I know. I just don't, I don't get that part of it. I don't get what makes you think unless you really been drinking that you're going to go, you know what? I'll bet she really wants to see my, my balls. Girls do. Some girls are crazy good ones. Damn. She's hot buttons. Warren Sanchez has been the romantic relationship with jet blue. She's hot since April, 2018 or Sunday long. So it's a long term thing. June, July. That's enough. He's probably shot so many loads. Wow. He's in love now. Yeah. Amazing. Do a Donald Trump had something to say about it. What do you say? So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozos being taken down by a competitor who's reporting I understand is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.

Speaker 3:          01:39:32       Hopefully the paypal soon be placed in a better, more responsible hands. Yeah, he wants, he watched it off. He wants her to get it. He wants Bayzos to not have the Washington Post, which is highly critical. The president, while the inquirer has been known to kill stores, critical, the president. Oh, so the enquirer got ahold of the story. I get it, but you know it was, I'll bet Jeff Bezos in president's mind. I'll bet is his opinion went up when he saw that picture of Sanchez probably. I'll bet he was like, but then you probably read the text messages and like, ah, amateur, come on. Come on. What are you telling her that uh, what, what are you going to do? Jump right out of the frying pan. Get right back into the fire. How about you go to fucking Ibiza and dance on the couch with a hundred of those broads?

Speaker 3:          01:40:17       Take a little time off is what you're saying. Jeff needs a, it needs a coach. Isn't that interesting how dude's do I think by wealthy dude seem to do that more than others. They seem to go straight from one relationship immediately into another one. Whereas I think that the average dude I think is doing what you're thinking, which is like, yeah, I'm gonna take some time down. Well the average dude also isn't running a gigantic multinational corporation like Amazon. The thing about that is the amount of time that that guy has to dedicate to his job, it's gotta be just unfathomable. I mean, I can't imagine what, what is involved and that guy's day to day activity and he seems ruthless as fuck and very hands on. So how did, he probably doesn't have time to go to a visa if the average guy had anywhere close to a hundred billion dollars though.

Speaker 3:          01:41:04       Oh, they just bail. Should everyday be strip clubs cash out to yeah, no more showing up at the office. Cash out. Cash me out and keep going. Catch me now I do podcasts. I keep showing it. I wouldn't have any ads, no ads, and be like, ah, I'm good. That'd be nice. I'm going to give you guys this shift for free. I looked at the overheads expensive. I need I just fucking building. And it's an amazing building, by the way, Internet. Thank you. Have you ever showed it? I mean, if you'd like displayed it right at the gym you've got is fantastic. Yeah. I so put some pictures of it up, but yeah. You know what, man? For me it's important because I'm not busy like Jeff Bezos, but I'm fucking busy. I need to get all my shit done in one spot, so on when I can.

Speaker 3:          01:41:50       I come here early, banging out a workout in the morning. I get my fucking sauna in float float in a sauna here. I didn't know. I didn't know the a tank. Yeah. Yeah. I've got a sauna. It's, it's for me, it's nice. I can get everything done in one spot. It actually saves me money just because the amount of time that I have now. I, by the way, uh, I did not say it at the outset, but I should say that show you didn't Boise, Boise, Idaho. It's a beautiful place. Uh, telling me that was fucking brilliant. Thank you. That's show was fantastic. Fun. People were talking about that for a lot of long time afterwards. It was, and it was a great crowd. Does a giant ass place. Yeah, it was fun. It was really good time. I mean, is it for people listening? It was a massive, it's a Taco bell arena, which is the best venue in, in, in the city.

Speaker 3:          01:42:35       It's a big venue and there was lines just blocks and blocks and blocks before they opened the doors and even after they opened doors because there was so many people. Boise is a great town, man. I was, I had heard how good it was. That was my first time ever go in there and I was blown away. The people were super friendly. It's gorgeous there. Everything is clean. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want anybody to move in. People are moving in. I think I we talked about that. Yeah. Before the show started, was it Wall Street Journal wrote an article saying it's, it is sometime ago, a couple of months ago or whenever it's saying it's fastest growing city in the, in the country. Once you go, there you go. Okay. Like if you brought your wife there and he said, look, this is what we're going to move here.

Speaker 3:          01:43:12       She was like, we got a lot of people from California coming up there. Of course say that much. Yeah. And some good friends of mine who is living down on the beach right now, uh, they, they seriously looking at it. They've been looking at property and think you maybe wolves, uh, with coyotes and the wolves. No, well, no, we haven't seen them. We got them, but we haven't seen. But we've got, we had a coyote in our neighborhood for quite awhile. He kind of became famous and they're, they're good looking coyotes. You know, east coast, they're, yeah, they're, they're like skinny and frail. They looked like Wiley Coyote. But out here, out west a up there, they're well fed. Well, you have so much wildlife. Yeah. Yeah. You know, Idaho has an incredible mule deer population. Do you have amazing El Population? Elk Hunting

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       is, yeah. Oh, it's beautiful. Yeah. Decided to go off the grid. That's one of my prime spots. Not telling nobody. I'll tell you. Let me know. I'm going to pave the way, man. It's so, it's, yeah, it's, it's a good spot. Um, and uh, and I, I got to stop talking about it too, because I get a lot of shit for saying nice things about it, but I can't, I can't help it. It's a zero sum. Yeah. Unheralded spots in this country. And I think that's most certainly one of them. Yeah. There's a, there's a gang of other ones too though, you know, and it's, it's really the west in the west, like the, these areas that just don't have the gigantic populations but have everything else. Gorgeous scenery and the mountain air and just God damn. Yeah. The fishing is, that's the other thing.

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       Oh my God. I'm sure. Fly Fishing and my oldest boy, uh, scooters is a really gotten into fly fishing and he's got a great mindset for it. Right. You know, he just, he's, he's one of those guys, he could be out there for a few hours, not catch anything and still have a great time. And really you've got other kids, like my, my two younger kids, you know, they just, they want a dynamite fish. Right. Right. They just want to get the fucking fish and get on with it. And so they don't, they're not going to fly fish at anytime soon, but scooters all about it. And uh, yeah, not to, uh, not to bang on about that, but basically all the wildlife activities or all the outdoor activities. Yeah. We got more river frontage, more river mileage than any state except for Alaska. Really? Yeah. Uh, we got more and the, and so the Whitewater is fantastic.

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       It's great rafting up there. The climbing's fantastic mountain biking. I mean, we'd jump on our bikes, we can be up in the foothills in literally about seven minutes and then spend the afternoon and not see anybody. I mean, it's crazy. And we live right in the center of town basically. And it's, you know, so anyway, yeah. Talk Dad, don't tell him about, oh, I've got a note from a, and go from mugsy my, my youngest boys teacher, he's like seven years old and he's not like seven years old. He has seven years old. It's like, Hey, he's approximately somewhere in the range. Yeah, yeah. I tried to hide his actual age for security reasons. And so anyway, we got a note from his teacher sang, happened a little bit of trouble finishing his assignments on time and he just kind of wanted to check in with you to see how to motivate them.

Speaker 1:          01:46:04       And this was just yesterday and I got this message as did my absolutely fantastic wife. And uh, so we had a funny conversation about, well, how do we respond to that? I mean like, he's seven years old, but all of it working for a living. How do you motivate them to cut and paste faster or something? But, so I, you know, all I could think of was food, right? Like my retriever, he, you know, he's food motivated my dog. And so I'm figuring, you know, monk, he's the same way. You know, you give them a cupcake and he'll finish that assignment. So I had no idea I was really stymied, you know, because I think, I know we all, you know, I mean our kids are, you know, like everybody else, you always feel your kids, hey great kids are smart and everything, but you know, and I, so I give

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       her, I give the teacher a lot of credit, you know, for being focused like that. But at the same time I stepped back and I looked at, I go and it's okay if he wants to slack off a little bit, he's 77 exactly. How do we have this obsession with getting kids to the bus? Or like I was a, I have a friend who's going to put their kid in a Waldorf school and we were talking about that and I guess they don't even teach him to read until the third grade. And my wife was like, get the fuck Outta here with that because my youngest daughter's in the third grade, she reads great. I mean we read every night, she reads perfectly. And I'm like, imagine if she hadn't even started learning how to read yet that, that, that and that, that's what opens up everything else.

Speaker 3:          01:47:30       You can't, you can't delay it. That part of it. And, but yeah. So yeah, I know we finish every evening with they, the kids have to read. Right. Get on, you know, finished reading too. That's the other thing. Like I don't think it's a bad thing to have kids read, but what I do, what does you heard it here? First verse, she'll taking a country writer. She'll stand on reading. I support it. What does concern me though is homework, cause uh, you know, my 10 year old, sometimes she cries, she's got so much home and she's like, we're all day to school and no have to do two hours of women. There's probably got activities to sports activities and so that consumes gymnastics bunch of other shit too. It's these kids, they want these kids to grow up to become hugely successful. And you know, they, they push him so hard and everybody in the community is this, is this, when you're in these wealthy communities too.

Speaker 3:          01:48:28       That's the other thing is all these other people, they all, everybody's working so hard. They want their kids to work so hard to like Jesus. I'm not, I'm, I'm in this weird spot where I'm an, I'm an an insider outsider. It's cause I'm in there and I kind of work hard. You work hard shit. What are you doing? Kind of work hard. It's not really work. None of it's, I have fucking scam this system. I got three fake jobs. I got three fake jobs. UFC fake job, standup comedy, fake ass job, podcasting. Definitely a fake job. I got three fake jobs. They're twins is the toughest. The toughest is right now.

Speaker 3:          01:49:11       I don't know what's the toughest, uh, probably uh, stand up. Stand up is the hardest to pull off. How long did you, let me ask you this, how long did it take for like the set that you did up in Boise, which was was fantastic. How long did that run? I didn't, I was laughing my ass off so I didn't, I don't, I did an hour and we'd go like an hour and 15 minutes and that took me, that was what, when I went up to boise was a couple months before a film my special. So that was the end of my run. So what I do is I develop an act for like a year. I tour with it for a year and then at the end of that tour I film a special, okay. So it takes me two years to put together where it's I fucking hammer that Samurai sword down, Polish it, and it's live performance, you know, it's fucking weird.

Speaker 3:          01:49:52       Sometimes one night a bit kills the other bit. T night it comes out a little clunky. You never sure how to do it. It's, it's a constant thing of an evolving it and moving it and changing it. Do you ever just drop something? Yeah, I mean that's all the time it's been working and then you go and you think, fuck it, I don't want to do it anymore. Yeah, yeah. You have to be enthusiastic. Yeah. Like in the beginning of Standup, you treat your jokes like their tools. Like uh oh this is a phillips head. I need a phillips head screwdriver. I'll fit that in there. And then after a while you realize like, okay, let me do what I like. I'm going to talk about shit that I like. And then you have, and then you realize, well the art form is trying to figure out how to make ideas funny.

Speaker 3:          01:50:32       And then then it becomes, if these ideas are funny to me, I've got to figure out a way to get them funded for other people. But if they're not funny to me, I'm not interested. And then so what are you doing here? You put something together and then you test it out on the kids are, and homer, no, don't have to tell you. No, no. You take it to like a small place, right? I take it to clubs. I go to the Ice House and the comedy store and the Improv and I, I go to these local places in La and I might do, like last night I did three shows and uh, I'll, I'll do that all the time. I'll do that. I'll do four shows, I'll do one show at the Improv, three at the comedy store. I do that all the time. How long did the shows h I mean, each, each sets our, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:51:10       Half hour, sometimes less. Sometimes must be exhausting. I mean, in a way, talk about how it's a fake job, but yeah, I mean, you gotta get up in front of people. You don't know what the reaction's going to be. That's the best job that I do, but also the most work. But it's the best out of the fake jobs that I have. That's the best fake job because it's the most fun. Like, you know, the Boise thing was like 11,000 people. If you crush in front of 11,000 people, that feeling is just, when you hear the roar, like you hit a punchline, you hear the roar of the crowd. It's like there's nothing like that. Nothing like that in the world. That was, it was, uh, again, anybody get a chance to go see, go see a show. Cause this one's just go see my netflix specials so you can see that thing now you have to pay more for Netflix now.

Speaker 3:          01:51:55       Yeah. What is it like 10 bucks? Yeah, 17% more. I think they're going to charge. Really? Yeah, they can. Yeah. Good. I have so much good shit though. Like if you want to just waste your life and sit in front of the TV, it's crazy. Like when we were kids, maybe that's your passion. So you get that universal basic income. And my following my passion means I got to sit and watch every episode of uh, Andy Fart under the sheets. And there's a lot of people doing that right now. I don't know if that's bad is, I mean, yes it is, but then doesn't that open the door for the, the people that aren't going to be like that? Like look, less people out there really actually trying to get ahead. I think the people that are going to try to succeed are always going to try to succeed. I think that's true and I think so. I think that's, maybe that's an argument against it also, which is said like, I don't think it's going to unlock a whole treasure trove of innovators. Right? If suddenly

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       you give people money and say, okay, you don't have to go, uh, poor coffee or, or flip burgers or you know, uh, clean up that road or whatever you're going to do for a living, you can follow your passion. I don't think we're going to find some exponential increase in the number of people inventing the wheel. I just think that it's just going to be a lot more people farden under the blankets or something. I don't know. They might be right, but the only good that I think could come out of it as a less people were in abject poverty and less people were desperate. So it might reduce crime. You might have lazy people, but you might also have less people that are inclined to steal things or do something that's illegal because their basic needs are taken care of. That's valid point. I read something that's, it stunned me.

Speaker 1:          01:53:30       It was, it was on a plane flying to, uh, to La. Um, and I read an article about this does strike right. The teachers here in Los Angeles, big strike, Los Angeles unified a school authority or whatever it's called, and it was just before they, they went on strike. But it talked about the problems at the school district has, and I don't know whether this statistic is right. I read it numerous times because I was so surprised by it. 80% of the, uh, families that use the Los Angeles public school system are at the poverty level or below. And that means of course, also that they rely on the free meal assistance, right. That the schools provide, which is kind of what was the point of the story was like, the schools are closed right now. And so, you know, kids aren't getting a chance to eat because they, that's their only chance to get to eat.

Speaker 1:          01:54:23       Right. But that number was stunning. That's crazy. Right? Uh, so I don't, I, I meant to look into it and do more research to see whether the article is actually correct or not, but hey, it was in the newspaper, so it must be true, right? I Dunno about that. Anyway. Uh, yeah, he's a disturbing number. It's a very disturbing number. But it also talked about how 12%, I think 12% of all kids that go to high school here in Los Angeles then go on to college, 12%. And uh, it was a similar number that never get out of high school and it's even worse than a place like New York City public schools. So I guess the point being is a public school system is, is it's dog shit in the larger urban centers. It's got some real problems. And I think a lot of those people that are the really sad things, a lot of those people that are at the poverty line or below work hard, it's not a lack of motivation and said, just don't have opportunities.

Speaker 1:          01:55:14       They don't know what to do. That not doing it the right way. They don't have guidance. They never learned correctly when they were young, single parent. They've, what's the two or three jobs? Um, and no, but I love California has got all sorts of interesting issues. I mean, there's, uh, you know, talking to some folks and they said, uh, a quarter of the nation's homeless people live here in California. 25% of the nation's homeless people live in California and a place to live. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, he's raised in the last few days. Most of the times it's beautiful weather. Hey, can't complain about the weather anyway, but it is crazy. And, and it also talks about how a lot of those people, they work, but they're homeless, right? The cost of housing. And so you've got people that have a job but they're living in their cars, right?

Speaker 1:          01:55:59       Because they can't afford housing, whether it's in San Francisco or Los Angeles. Insanity. Yeah. That is, that place is insanity. So your point about the basic universal income, I take that point. I see what that, you know, if it was possible to pay for it and uh, and again, you know, kind of do this thing where you, you're monitoring this issue of motivation so you're not creating another follow on generation of just complete slack acids. Then I think that's it. That's a really valid point. I, my concern would be people that didn't appreciate it and people that felt entitled, like they felt like someone owed them that money. You're going to have that. I mean this is the, this is the biggest problem that people have with socialism and socialist attitudes that some of these kids that are coming up right now, they look at what they call income inequality, what they don't look at his effort inequality.

Speaker 1:          01:56:50       Like some people put in more fucking work and are smarter. They've figured their way through the game better than you have been doing it for 50 years or whatever they brain. Right. I couldn't agree with him more in the sense that I, I never begrudged anybody. I never got pissed off with a rich person because they were rich. Right. I think it, hey, that's good. I'd like to be rich. Right. Right. So I might want to talk and find out, hey, how'd you do it? Or how'd you do it? And yeah, it's a system sometimes, you know, set up so that once you have some money, you can get more money. Well, of course the fuck it is. Yeah. I mean, I, if I have some money, I can invest that money and make more money if I'm smart about it, if I do it right.

Speaker 1:          01:57:30       Yeah. If you do it right. But I absolutely, I don't, and I don't begrudge the idea that's it. So that's part of it is also fairly steeped in the idea that, you know, we're living in a very, uh, unique country. Right. And I do worry sometimes that people don't, you know, I, I, you know, even family and I've got some friends and others who were just constantly pissing and moaning about this place. And I'm thinking, I spent almost all my life over and shit holes around the world and I, there is no other place I would rather be as a country. And I know that's, you know, it's jingoistic or whatever. But uh, honest to God, I still believe, and if you go someplace and you've talked to somebody in some fifth world, they will also have, my experience has been any way, uh, maybe you're listening in, your experience is different, but that's the way it works is that they'll think if I go to America, if I can get to America and I work hard, I can, I can be successful. And that I think is still true. And that's what I worry about with entitlements and thinks that that make kill that belief. And you're right, incoming inequality. Yeah, no, that's, but it's your right, you work harder now. It doesn't always happen, but life's not supposed to be fair. It's, well, it's maybe it's supposed to be fair, but it's not fair. So

Speaker 2:          01:58:41       sorry, I was just supposed to be life. It's definitely not fair. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, I, I completely see your point and I, and I agree with it. I think that the real concern is that people don't appreciate already how great they have and what incredible opportunity they have. And if we increase w w we give them more benefits with less effort than you're going to develop more of this attitude that we find disturbing, which is people that don't have an appreciation for literally the greatest experiment in self government, the world has ever known. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:59:13       yeah. No, I, I, but I think also that there's, there's parts of it that need to be looked at. Like there's, it, there's an interesting study about, uh, uh, about college and graduation rates from college for, um, for, uh, disadvantaged folks. You know, and that was again, why they made it easier for tuition assistance. Right? So the idea was we want to expand the college ability for everybody, which is a great idea. Right? But what they found was they expanded the, the, the, the, the college opportunity for everybody. But over the past decade, decade and a half, fewer people from the lower income, uh, uh, categories have been graduating. Right? So you've, what you've done is you said, come on in. It's like, you know, it's like a special operators, right? If, if, if you lower the bar, right? Right. Um, and this is where I'm going to get in trouble probably.

Speaker 1:          02:00:07       I'll talk about the marines and you know, allowing women into combat elements. I know, oh my God, well what did they do? Well, you lower the bar. [inaudible] you make it, you know? Okay, well not enough of them could get through the course. So I'm going to change the regulations. And so if you change the regulations, what they found, where the college was, if you, if you increase that pool of people going, it doesn't mean that they're going to be successful. Right? And now what you've done is you've kind of saddle them with some college debt and they didn't graduate. So they're still earning what a high school graduate earns and the system doesn't work. And so I think sometimes just the idea of throwing money at the problem or, or, or it doesn't, it's not helpful if we don't think it through and then assess the results. So, but yeah, that, that, that whole marine experiment, I think

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       they're, they're catching it laid in the chain and I think it's good to give people the opportunity to succeed and to advance themselves. But if you really want to address it as a systemic problem, you got to get to the root of it, which is these unbelievably horrible neighborhoods and these, these toxic environments that these kids are growing up and being abused and being scared and bullied and terrible piss poor education, you know, first through all the way up to high school. That's, I mean, that's really where you have to address it. I mean, addressing, adjust at the college level and giving them the opportunity to get into college and making it easier for them. It doesn't negate the terrible foundation that's been laid by their life.

Speaker 1:          02:01:36       But yeah, and I think we had this idea that college should be for everybody. Right. And that's okay. That's great. And that's, I think that's where the, you know, people like Cortez and Bernie Sanders and others with their idea of free tuition, you know, they're thinking, okay, well look at Europe. You know, there's some countries in Europe have free tuition and hey, it's, you know, it's relatively prosperous and there's nothing wrong with that. But at the same time, you know, I think we, we don't, we, we don't assess the cost and the overall efficiency of an idea sometimes. And so we just assume and open it up, let everybody go and somehow this is going to work right. To our advantage and honest got answer is no, you know, I think somebody is better off sometimes, you know, go into, you know, becoming a plumber, you know, maybe, maybe not honorable living.

Speaker 1:          02:02:25       It's a living great. Yeah. To create living. One of the happiest guys I know is my plumber in Boise. That guy is, I mean, he's got it knocked right. He's always out for hunting season and you know, he'll call, I'll say, look, I gotta, I gotta Lick, right? I'm a if my ceilings about the cave. And he goes, well, I'm going hunting and sorry, he's just got, he's got his own schedule. Right. But he's got a great job and there's nothing wrong with that. But I think we developed this idea. So like homeownership, everybody should own a home when we saw with that took us, right? Yeah. When you lower the requirements and suddenly we're all, you know, it's blown up and we're fucked. But anyway, uh, what do I know? What do I, what's the,

Speaker 2:          02:03:04       what do I know either, but I see your points and I know, I know what you're saying. I think that one thing to disturb the shit out of me, his student loans, I mean you w one of the worst ways to prepare a kid for the futures to saddle them down with a quarter million dollars worth of debt by the time they graduate from college right now. Absolutely. And then they get a $50,000 a year job and they're like, what in the, and they're doing well with a $50,000 a year job. That's a great job to get out of college and in you just look at the debt that you have and you're like, what the fuck is this? How am I going to pay this shit?

Speaker 1:          02:03:35       Yeah. No, I know. And we have sold a student's a bill. A good yes. And, and, and you know, some of it. Okay. Some of it's on them, right? Some of it, you know, the older students are the ones who are willing to take out this loan and then suddenly they're using the money for something else. Okay, fine. There's individual responsibility. But no, I agree with you that there's student loan debt is a, is a major issue. We occasionally that the Capitol Hill talks about it, but not really. I told, I told my daughter, who's a fantastic person and I said, you know, the biggest gift you're getting is getting out of college without any, any debt. That's, you know, so you know, dad's not going to buy you your own wagon here.

Speaker 2:          02:04:10       You got to pick out your tuition and that's it. That's it. That's the best I can. That's a gigantic headstart for kids. I mean, it sounds so fucked up, but it's true. To not be in debt is gigantic. Look, they're giving kids credit cards and their frontal lobes aren't even developed yet. They're doing all kinds of wacky. They're like, wow, I'll figure it out. But you ain't figuring out shit. He never figured out things up till now. And the idea that you're going to get magically smarter over the next months while you owe

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       all this money is crazy. Right? You kids oldest have a phone yet for security purposes or what is this? What do you got here? Jamie? Student loan clock. Oh my God, what is, I can't even figure out what that is. One point 6 trillion try got really good at go. Oh, so what is this website that people can go to? This college debt.com I just typed in student loan. Holy Shit. Look at that. That is an insane amount of money on a second. Something like that. Is that what it is like I'm just kind of guessing off what I'm seeing. Yeah, it's an insane amount of money. So you just made that number up. You just just stop at whatever. No, I don't look at credit cards. Auto loans. Is that the credit cards and auto loans for us? All of us Americans are students. And then those, it's all credit card debt. When I just looked at two on another page that had a clock at that, it's just the same number. It said it's not including the interest on the federal loans. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:05:38       So you look at that and you think, okay, no wonder it's a, it's a popular idea of saying you've got to write down student loans, you've got to get free tuition going on and do all these things again. You know, can the country pay for it? I don't. I don't think so. Should we be talking about it? Absolutely. She'll be looking for other alternatives and other options. Yeah. But you know, I think it's, it's, uh, you know, we're not even willing to address the issue of social security and Medicare and trying to deal with entitlement to say currently exist, which we know, you know, are going to bankrupt us at some point. Right. We know that it's not, it's not a mystery and we can't deal with that. So how are we going to deal with these other issues? Well, that's the question I had about a guy

Speaker 3:          02:06:17       trump who doesn't seem to like to pay attention to things. How the hell is one person supposed to be in the director of all these various aspects of our world?

Speaker 1:          02:06:29       Yeah, no, I, I, I've heard that, uh, you know, uh, from, uh, what's the name of the economist, uh, uh, uh, can't remember his name, but it went very, very smart guy, very smart economist who was talking about this and saying, this is what we expect of a president. Think about all these things the president has to be cognizant of and, and, and supposedly capable of digesting a lot of information and making decisions on a very number of things. And obviously, yeah, you delegate and you're fine. But it is an interesting system and it is interesting how, you know, I mean right now there's a lot of people that don't have faith in the current president to make, you know, some of your basic decisions, uh, previous administration, there are a lot of people that was convinced he could understand anything, right? I mean, he was capable of all of it. So I don't think the job itself is too big. And I just think that the way that we, uh, go through the selection process has slowly over a period of time, you know, gone downhill and is kind of resulted in what we're doing right now. Part of it's the, the bullshit primary process, you know, and the way that we do the initial selection, there's, there's, you know, there's

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       a lot of things I suppose. Sure. The fact that you have to be registered as a Democrat or Republican to vote in the primaries and all those things, and then, you know, it was just everything. Like the, the whole thing is a big mess. But on the flip side, here's what's crazy. Trump doesn't seem to be aging. Everybody. I really think it says age is so hard. They age so hard because they're paying attention to everything and they have real concern. Well, yeah, that seems to be just like I've fucking water on a duck's back. Well, you know, maybe he's, he's going to outlive with salt. Maybe he's figured out how to avoid the stress.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       Yeah. Oh, you remember what prison Obama looked like when he finally walked out office or Bill Clinton? I saw Bill Clinton not too long ago. We went down a little rock. And you saw him? Yeah, he was at an event that we were relatively small dinner and chasing pussy.

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       Yeah. I'm not saying he touched me inappropriately, but you know, want to know where I got my burner phone. Have to be a fly on the room. Oh, fly on the wall in a room with that. I,

Speaker 1:          02:08:38       I will say this much about him. He was, uh, we started talking. I thought it was just going to go up and shake his hand and say, you know, hey ms president, you know, good to see you. Because I always liked the guy. Right. And okay. You know, uh, aside from his obvious, you know, issue and the problem we had in terms of his ability to, to, uh, to, to govern and the fact that he's a, he's a smart son of a bitch. Um, and he, uh, I just found him, uh, you know, capable of the job, right? I just like it did with President Bush and you know, they were good aspects of president. [inaudible] I thought I have a dog in the hunt, right? I mean, I'd rather see the results in the person. But anyway, talking to President Clinton, he, uh, we started talking and he immediately went to a, an old, uh, agency, uh, operation and old thing that had happened during his time when he was president to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          02:09:29       And you could tell that he, I mean, he had retained a tremendous amount of information. Right. And we were talking and we ended up talking for 15 minutes or so, just kind of about this particular incident. And he was kind of curious and he wanted to, you know, and he wanted to recount some of the thought process that they were going through. And, and I found it really interesting in the sense that that was a, it was a surprisingly deep conversation, right. For any, and he's curious and I always thought that was the most important quality for anybody who gets in that job is he's, they have to be curious, right? They have to be inquisitive and, um, you know, on the scale of, you know, presidents, where does the current president, you know, exist in, in the curiosity scale? I don't know. But I think that's probably not his strong suit.

Speaker 1:          02:10:14       So maybe that's one of the reasons why he's not aging. It's because he, he's, you know, he's not asking that fourth or fifth question that leads you to the point where you go, Huh, that's a pretty fucked up situation now we got to worry about that one. So maybe it is, you know, water off the back and he's, and he's, uh, he's figured out a way to deal with stress. Well, the, on the plus side, he seems to be making business owners happy. It seems at least ones that aren't affected by the sanctions against China because a, there's like steel manufacturing and a lot of other companies that are very upset by, yeah. Yeah. Well I think it's, it's the regulations that, that they've done that they haven't really touted, uh, in terms of deregulating, some of the things that make us like the previous administration, you know, a lot of good points, but some bad points.

Speaker 1:          02:10:56       One of the bad points was a sort of, um, the, uh, hamstringing of industry through a overregulation on everything. Right? And so lifting some of that on, you know, there's this, you can argue whether, you know, you want bigger government and less government, but you can't argue with the fact that it did unleashed a industry and business more than the previous administration. So that's a good thing. Um, but yeah, look at all the other concerns. I mean, now we're talking about a global slowdown because China's numbers are looking soft. Germany's looking soft. What does that mean? Everybody's worried about brexit. So there's, there's a lot of things for people to be focused on, you know. Um, and I worry sometimes that all we do here in the states, it's kind of like chasing the next shiny ball, a tin foil. Cause we're all a bunch of raccoons, right?

Speaker 1:          02:11:42       We have such a short attention span for everything. And, uh, anyway, what am I saying? I don't know. Sorry. Right. Everybody's like, well, he was talking about attention span. The last thing I'm going to definitely want to talk to you about, it's one of the things that trump brought up recently is the JFK case and releasing some of the files and they wanted to redact the information that pertained to the people that were still alive. Now I want to know what, what, I don't know what you could say, but what do you think about the JFK case? Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone? Um, I can see

Speaker 1:          02:12:28       of all the, of all the sort of incidents of all, I don't mean to minimize it or minimize it by calling it an incident, but of all those situations, the Kennedy assassination and Mlk, Martin Luther King's assassination, those are the two that I understand more than anything else. Why they've linkerd, why people don't believe the shit that they've seen and why they, why they have concerns about it. Uh, Martin Luther King more than Kennedy. I believe that there was something there that we still don't understand in terms of who else was responsible and who organize that and who, who assisted in that. Right. I just think of those two. That's the one I've got bigger questions on the Kennedy assassination. I think that, uh, I think that Oswald pulled the trigger. I think in his mind, uh, the reason he was doing it was for the greater good of, of communism and to, uh, boost his image with the Soviets and, and, uh, w with the Cuban regime.

Speaker 1:          02:13:30       Um, do I think that he had assistance? Um, I don't know. I don't think so, but I could be swayed from that with, with better evidence than I've seen. But, um, I understand why people are so dug in on it. Right. Because I mean, look, it was a massive event, right? It was a massive event, but Oswald had sufficient training. You did not have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out. It was a different era and we don't understand it in today's terms, but when you get right in that position and look out that window and look at the shot that was taken and you know, what was involved in that, I was not, uh, you know, you've shot, you know, you've, uh, this sounds terrible, but you know, you know, anybody who's hunted, you know, has taken a more difficult shot in that.

Speaker 1:          02:14:16       Yeah. Um, so that part of it and, and his motivation and his past ties to the Soviets. Do I think the Soviets were pulling the trigger on it too? I think the mafia, we're pulling the trigger. I, I haven't seen anything that convinces me that that was the case. I think that Oswald felt like he was doing it for them or he was just, he was going to prove himself in that regard. But, uh, again, I, I understand why people are dug in the mlk one, Martin Luther King. I just, um, I think that, I don't think he acted alone. What makes you think that? Um, I think that, look, he was a loser, a two bit criminal, right? Who was constantly getting picked up for the shift that he was doing and ending up in jail. But he was a mess, right? There was nothing clever about him.

Speaker 1:          02:15:06       And then leading up to the assassination, he cleaned up his act. Suddenly he went from looking like a two bit, you know, criminal and all to a college professor basically. And he had cash. He was able to, you know, purchase a vehicle and he kind of went off the grid for a while. He went onto this drive, right? And sort of stayed off the grid. And he behaved in a way that he hadn't up until, you know, months before this thing took place. And then he ended up in Europe, you know, and, um, I just, uh, something tells me that he had, um, uh, assistance in some fashion. I don't know who right or whatever, but I just, that's the one that more than than any, any others that I've looked at, you know, makes me step back and go, no, we don't, we don't know the whole story here.

Speaker 1:          02:15:59       Um, the Kennedy thing, I, you know, again, maybe there's something out there that we just haven't turned over a, that's always a possibility. But, um, yeah, mlk I think is a, is that's the one that's most disturbing. That's interesting. I don't know enough about the mlk murder. I need to go look into that now. Especially if you think that something was going on. Look at his behavior. Um, what the hell was his name again? James Earl. Ray. James Earl Ray and I, I've talked to his brother. I've interviewed his brother, um, for what, uh, for a show, a series where we did a, uh, kind of, uh, investigative look into this. Um, and, um, I, there is, if you, if, if, if all you do when you're, when you're looking at this is to look at Ray's behavior in that year leading up to the assassination. Um, that's the, that's the interesting for me, that's the most interesting part.

Speaker 1:          02:16:57       I mean, put it in context with everything he did up until that point, which was, he was basically, again, just a two big criminal, couldn't stay out of jail and then you get this and you get this change in behavior and this change in the parents in this, you know, sudden ability to, you know, be, uh, something that he wasn't up until that point, I guess everybody can change. But that was, that was the most striking part for me. Um, there's no obvious source of income? No, no, just, just, uh, just to, you know, just again, just a penny. Any criminal basically. And, um, there was plenty of information. It wasn't like he couldn't have gathered if you say, well, no, he acted on his own. Well, okay. Yeah. Was there information? Ah, yes. The leading right up until the day before there was talk about, oh, you know, there were news reports showing a king at the Lorraine Motel. Um, and you know, coming in and out of the room, you know, that he was staying in and so it wasn't as if, you know, you couldn't gather that information on your own, you know, but it was again, it was that behavior leading up to it. And I'm not a conspiracy guy at all. Right. I've seen too much shit to, you know, to think that, you know, every conspiracy home water. So, um, but this one, it was disturbing in that regard. What that's worth,

Speaker 3:          02:18:08       right? Yeah. You should look into it and we'll talk about next time. See what you think. Cause I, I'd really be interested in, I think, I don't think we're going to this show that we're gonna get ready to do here. Start filming in next month is not going to be looking into things like that. What is it? What is it called? It's got to be called black files. They may change the number or the name just before we go on there. But um, you know, I really enjoyed the shows that I did in the past. American declassified with the, they're looking into

Speaker 1:          02:18:31       conspiracies. I've really enjoyed it. I really thought it was fascinating and I get why people feel that way.

Speaker 3:          02:18:38       Yeah. Kennedy for sure when they're on the outside. The Kennedy wanted, to me the bullet is the most disturbing thing. Yeah, the pool would that just showed up on Connolly's Gurney. Oh look where we found. We found this spot and it's not distorted and supposedly went through two people and shattered bone. That magic bullet. The magic bullet yet it's just, I don't buy it. And I don't think that that bullet came from there. That's probably the most of all things. So cause we looked at the, the grassy knoll issue and the possibility of spot hitting other kids from the other side. Yeah. The fuck out of here. I've got bullet doesn't pull it drives me crazy. It does that there's more pieces of the bullet fragments in connally's body. When you look at the look at the x rays of Conley's bodies that show bullet fragments, there's little pieces, they found a little tiny pieces of metal in his body from the bullet fragments. Huh. But you don't see that missing from the bullet. It's bullshit. Yeah. The bullet, the bullet thing is, is, and, and I, you know, again, there's, there's

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       elements of it that you look at, but collectively I just, you know, and again, maybe there's something else out there. Maybe there is and we just haven't uncovered it or maybe this will prompt, you know, some additional information. Who knows? But, um, yeah. Anyway, it's, it's fascinating shit. But uh, I do get it because it's so, it was such a seminal moment. Right. And nobody wants to think that something that bad, that horrific. And that's something that could sort of shatter the country in that fashion. It could be done by one, one guy, Mike Lee Harvey Oswald or John Hinckley. Hinckley. Yeah, yeah, exactly. We just let him out. Yeah. Not for good, right? Not for good. I think it was on a release program of Fuck Outta here for life. Get the fuck outta here forever. I don't care how, how well you've been behaving for 20 years.

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       We've been locked up in a mental, Simon, he shot the president. Get the fuck Outta here. It's like what is wrong with people? Yeah. I, it's, it's that whole idea. He's done his time. He's done this time. Yeah. He's, he's been, uh, he's been rehabilitated. And, uh, and that's always that argument. Is Prison for incarceration or is it for rehabilitation? As for us, for us, shot the president. Get in the cage. Hey, can I say one thing? Yes, please. Oh, we finished up, uh, uh, this is sort of a, a bump for a buddy of mine who's in Boise, just wrote his first book. If anybody's out there and they're looking for a book to read. Um, uh, his name is andrew cousins and, uh, he's a former operator who, you know, knows his shit and it's his first attempt at a fiction novel. It's called a failed state and it's set in Afghanistan and also here in the U S and a couple of other places, Turkey and Germany and elsewhere. Uh, interesting rate. A lot of technical information in there. It's a, it's a fiction novel, but he's dumped a lot of information in there, so it's clear he knows what he's talking about, but it's worth, it's, it's, it's worth a peak. If anybody's looking for something to read, look, just you looking out for his buddy. Yeah, he's a good guy. Well, hey brother, great to see you again. Thank you very much. Good luck where you show. I appreciate that. Come on again after it's over. I'll do it. Thank you everybody.

Speaker 5:          02:21:38       Thanks. [inaudible].
