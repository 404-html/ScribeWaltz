Speaker 1:          00:00          I was out there, have the answer, a real solid answer for the tail summons for. Isn't that weird that Bj would, would not have a guard like that, that he wouldn't have this Ninja assassin guard? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you know why? Because he didn't. I and I, and I would say this, I mean I've told this to Bj, tell him like, you know what, if you stay at 55, there's really no reason to master any kind of guard. Just get back up. You're fucking ever be better than everybody standing up. Nobody at 55 can take you down. Even big wrestlers can't take you down. I even thought he doesn't need a. He doesn't really need to focus on his car. I thought he didn't need to develop an. I really didn't even know it was interested in the rubber guard and he fucks with it a little bit, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:41          But he, I'm sure he felt like no one's going to put me on my fucking back, but maybe now, now that he knows like shit, these fighters are getting so much better and there's so many wrestlers out there, you really have to have the answer for Chael Sonnen and for like Frankie Edgar and framing. Yeah, for these elite wrestling. What he did to Florian, he took him down and got on top. When they talk about your garden, the only answer for, for the elite wrestler, and they're all, they're all over the top 10 of every UFC weight division. The only aunts or one of the only. There's only a couple of answers and one of them is having a. When they talk about your guard, they don't say that. It's just a man. He's got an okay guard at a decent guard. They have to say, your guard is a fucking amazing, like don't go in his garden.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Your Garden has to be like Ryan Hall. Your guard has to be Shinier Yolk. You don't want to fucking be in your flag raid like Anthony Pettis and Shane Roller. When Anthony Pettis slapped on that trial, exactly. You have to have a super dangerous car. If they are not. If people don't talk about your guard like it's amazing and it's fucking crazy wicked, and they. It's one of the best guards in your division, then you're not good enough. You don't have the answer for the elite wrestler most of the time. Sometimes you throw up a, a, a, you know a pop triangle and it lands like Anderson Silva made it work in the fifth round. I'm Chris Leben made that pop triangle work and you know the Nogueira style of triangle at work that works. It does work, but not at the highest rate. You know there's, there's a lot of the things that you could do as well to add to that already game, you know, to those Nogueira triangles, you could mix it all up.

Speaker 1:          02:16          There's a lot of things you can do. Just look at what Shinya Aoki has done. Look at what Dustin Hayzlett has done. Look at what Matt Horwitz has done. Just pay attention. It's out there. You can watch it on youtube. You can do it too. You need to have the answer for the elite wrestler and man, having a crazy wicked guard can be the answer. What is the image name? Tony and I ran into James. Tony, it's amazing that you lived in. You know, I was pulling for him at first. Well, I thought that box. I thought that these MMA guys really didn't know these. When you're a boxer in you're that high rate of a boxer, you know, you really don't know. These guys get hit and their hands and that the timing of this shit. But when I watched the countdown was when I was like, he didn't work.

Speaker 1:          03:04          He didn't work. He got a great opportunity to represent boxing, but he didn't work. You don't think you've worked out. I lost a lot of weight. He lost 15 pounds a month. Okay. If you're rolling, Eddie, student law 60 in a couple months. If you're really fucking roll. Let's say you take this guy on, you got four months, the first month or you're doing with them. You're not working his hands. They're already there. So you're basically working and getting up and just rolling little things. Just surviving on my back right there. All those things are bad. You know what? I used to go to judo when I was a kid. I was skinny as shit because the hardest thing about judo is flipping. It's every time you get up and down, you get up and down. 50 Times a day that you get skinny. This guy didn't do that.

Speaker 1:          03:45          He got some guy from the FBI to come in and train them. You know what the fuck? They go, Oh, you know I'm in. I'm in. I'm in Hollywood with Ladell. I'm rolling. I'm rolling with Einstein. I'm learning the basics. How to Bro? What? How much can I learn? And four months to get me out of a mess. That's what I'm learning. He didn't know any better. You didn't know. He didn't know where. He got a guy from the FBI that God knows that they fucking paid up. One was the guy who trained him to Kenpo videos of him online, like Campo with guys that come behind him and cut his legs and stuff and the guy was trained, James Tony that's on the underground. I say James. Tony actually doing it. Well, I mean he, you know, he looked the guy set up a program for him, but what does the guy know for real?

Speaker 1:          04:25          You know, what he really needed to do is go to Colorado Springs and train at the Olympic training center. He needed to get a guy who's a fucking Jujitsu master to come with them. Okay, these guys are going to take you down. He going to do your best to stop, to take down. Then once they get you taken down, then you're going to work at guard. That's what you need to get down and try to submit those bureau a motherfucking daily basis. When I watch the countdown show, what was very clear to me is that the guys who was working out with, we're letting him do things for the camera and that it was. They weren't elite grapplers. They were letting him do things like, I was like, ah. It was a demonstration, like anytime you change roles all over, like, ah, I can't believe he's doing this.

Speaker 1:          05:04          It's like they were like letting him do it. They're putting on a show and letting james throw them around. I was like, this is silly. I'm like, he might not know anything about grappling. There was this dude that found Hobby Vasquez back at my first king of the cage show in 2000. He comes out in claims, he's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt. He's this French karate guy, and he thought back then he just started like, you could just say shit like that. And so he said, I'll take the. He said he's been training Jujitsu 12 years and he's a black belt under hoists gracie. That's what he was telling Carrie trouble cock. And Terry's got, I think we've got a live one here. He calls the police Gracie Academy. They never heard of the guy. The guy's bullshitting. He's trying to scare harvey into going to the ground with them.

Speaker 1:          05:39          And Hobby was a purple belt. But uh, did Matt destroyer on the local southern California scene, he would've gone to Santa Santa Cruz as well and smash. He was the fucking destroyer of the purple belts division and there wasn't very many browns and blacks at that point and he was going to go against this guy who claimed to be a black belt dude habit. Took them down and like the guy had no training dude, zero has used, just laid flat on his back and he tap really crooked hobby powder in them a couple of times. He just kept and it was over. It's like, what the fuck was that? That's an interesting story, but a much more interesting story is the other guy that we know that claim to be a Brazilian jujitsu black belt that really didn't know anything that turned out to be a murderer.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Yes. Yeah. There was a dude we knew his, his fake name was Raphael Tory. But his real name, what was his real name? Damn, I don't remember. But he told people he, uh, he taught karate karate his whole life and he taught karate and he told people he was a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu, but this Guy Eddie was hanging around with this guy. He was doing Brazilian. He said it was a website, right? He was. No, he was a writer. He was probably one of the most popular journalists back down on the underground. I mean Ralph El Toro was all over the underground. It was 2000. It was still in the dark ages, so it wasn't easy for a guy to bust up and he was on speed all the time. I didn't know this until years later. So he would work hard. She would always have shit and pride loved them.

Speaker 1:          07:00          He always had reports. He always had interviews. He was always, oh dude, he was probably one of the top three riders in Alabama. And I remember he was very productive and he would do. He was doing his version of Gonzo journalism for MMA, like asking MMA fighters if they like anal sex. I just like being real crazy. That was my shift. So it turned out that this dude wasn't really a black belt at all and um, we, we, you know, it wasn't half Brazilian. Yeah. It was like, it was all crazy. We were driving and Eddie had this confrontation with them on the phone. To make a long story short, homeboy winds up killing some dudes strangling him to death. The husband of this chick that he's banging and he winds up going to jail for it. When he was, he was a murderer. He, he, he got this guy insurance.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Medicaid. Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, the wife of this guy that he strangled, you know, so they, they decided to set this up and he choked the guy to death until the guy with a real naked choice. How ironic is it? That is black belt wasn't legit, but he killed someone with a rear naked choke. A Guy, poor guy killed in a trained at all and probably didn't even see it coming. I just jumped up and choke the shit out of him. Can You Imagine Matt Madman, your fucking wife as banging some other dude? That dude comes to your house and kills you. It didn't go to his house, he's lured him into Jim and I testified on that trial. Did you really had to go to court and just finger, um, and they called me. They called me. The cops called me because I called Gerald wants and when I was talking to Gerald on the phone, the phone was being tapped and Gerald and I are talking about, you know, his, uh, possibility to him fight in the UFC who is, you want to fight this Napa and Rafael Torres name comes up and I'm like, what's going on with that dude?

Speaker 1:          08:45          And so Jerald was being tapped and he was talking all these different people about it. And then, you know, the, everybody that he talked to on the phone, they had to talk to the cops. But I didn't really know anything. I didn't know the guy. I just knew the guys ready. Fortunately I want to fucking go to court about that. Yeah. So what'd you have to say? Yeah, that guy's a fake. He's a liar. Basically. I forget the questions they made me ask, but I hung out with that. Like he was always brought in on whatever show I was commentating, whether it was king of the cage or pride or even a too hot to handle. He was always the reporter who's going to blow up the handle was in Holland, right? Boss Man, boss Dude. And he was, he was so busy. He was so amped up on speed.

Speaker 1:          09:29          He always had articles and to blow up shows you bring Rafael Torah and they'll blow it all up. All over the Internet. Right? Always on speed. Huh? How'd you find out? He was always on speed. It came out later on the trial. Do you know I'm already took a uh, what is it called? Adderall. Took an adderall. Says is the fucking greatest thing ever for getting things done. He said it just cleaned out. The speed did. Yeah. But what is it? Why is it speed can help you get organized? How does that work? How does it give you fucking energy? What the fuck? You feel like you could do anything? You just want to paint the fucking house. You want to go to college? It's to fucking Louisiana. You know what I mean? Is it bad for you? Is it bad for you? Come on. It's gotta be it's gotTa be right.

Speaker 1:          10:08          What comes up must come down. Right? Anything that speeds you out. It's got to be bad. That's like super, but it's not just super speeds you out. It makes me like really organized. Robert told me once, he took one accidentally and he said he just started organizing all of his notes. Just that's what happens when you add speed to think that you could use that though as a tool if you could really make sure you didn't do too much of it and didn't fuck up your whole system and short circuit everything like every now and then when you knew that the problem as you come down so hard that you want more to come down from adderall. I don't know about adderall but anything speeding usually goes up. Comes down hard on it every day. Are you, what does he say? Buddies. He said he loves it and it helps them organize.

Speaker 1:          10:47          Helps them work and he's pretty fucking ambitious. He's, he's a hard worker, but he said he was just really listless and couldn't get anything going on and you know, and they got them on the adderall and then pam just couldn't focus and concentrate on things. He just had a hard time committing to things and concentrating. Maybe it works different than speed because speed somehow I don't know how it works really well by Athena speed and that's the fuel of the capitalist society and I mean look, we're the, we're the, we're the people who drink coffee everyday. We have a, in every union contract they have to negotiate a time where you could take a drug. There's a fucking coffee break, you know, and union contracts have coffee break time. What does the coffee break cover? Break was your work. It's fucking 11:00 AM. It's not quite launched yet.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Coffee truck pulls up and you get a chance to take fucking five slash 10 minutes off and fuel up on some, some stimulants. It's good for the company. You come back, I'll jazz and charged and you feel better. You work harder, you feel better, and you feel like you got another little break. You know, that's, that's union things is one thing they figured out that was smart. You know, look, everybody doesn't have to be a slave. Like people will like go against unions. The unions fuck up business and they don't work hard and they make too much money and blah blah blah. They make work easier and that's good. All right. It's not good to have people work like fucking slaves. You know? Wouldn't it be better if they got a little bit less done? But everybody was more happy when that'd be better. They get a nice coffee break and get to relax for an hour for lunch where they don't feel like they're getting tortured all day.

Speaker 1:          12:07          You know? Maybe if they got some shit to do during lunch, they can go somewhere and fucking pay a bill or you know, pick up the fucking thing that they were supposed to buy fast. Do those hours go by God damn that our break our breaking shit. Talking about coffee break is a smoke break. Get outta here. Josie. Twenty $100.
