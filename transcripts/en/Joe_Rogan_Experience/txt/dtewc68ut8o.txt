Well it helps your brain function better. It's like you know you drink a little cup of coffee you get a little pick me up. Yeah I mean you can think a little better. At least I can Alpha Brain is it's like that nutrients that may enhance your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters just helps your brain flow. There's a lot of controversial science behind all this. I use it and I use it because it's effective and I've been using it for years.

Speaker 5:          00:02:08       I started using it and I'll give another plug to him because he's gonna be on the podcast eventually Bill Roman asked his neuro one was the first neutral pick that I ever tried and he concocted this combination of nutrients to help himself after he had he developed a few concussions from football.

Speaker 6:          00:02:25       I know he's actually said if he didn't see stars he didn't think he was hit right. Jesus Christ. Every day it's like being in a car accident.

Speaker 7:          00:02:33       Tumble car expansion and you're a big football fan right. You're real aware of.

Speaker 8:          00:02:38       I was in Denver and we were doing some big comedy central Romanesque he was. They said well I said when I'm in L.A. interview Romanesque ask is said no you know I said I do like and I go in and lunch. He's sitting there at a table of eight alone the rest of the place is packed. Whoa yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:02:55       I don't mean to interrupt you but I just. That's intense.

Speaker 10:         00:02:58       I mean I but I am curious to know how scary. It's like now that fucking guy by himself.

Speaker 6:          00:03:05       He was the one that spit in the guy's face on Monday night football and then they said it was a racial thing. I'm thinking no it's not a racial thing. He's just a nut. Yeah he wasn't doing anything.

Speaker 5:          00:03:13       He's just a fucking gangster on a grid of his stuff. Neuro one is the first nootropics I've ever tried. If you're in shit now for brain go to on it Doc comments. Oh and I t use the code name Rogan and save yourself 10 percent of any and all orders. We also have kettle bells. And finally and they are the best quality kettle bells that we could find there. Made by York and we're selling them as cheap as we can sell them. They're excellent. You only need to buy them once for an entire lifetime's worth of use and they're in my opinion. They're my favorite workout piece of equipment. I don't hardly do anything other than I do some bench press stuff. I do some a lot of chin ups and bodyweight squats and stuff like that but almost everything else I do is kettle bells because it's just such an effective workout.

Speaker 5:          00:03:58       For like real body functional strength. There's a lot of videos that are available on how to use kettle bells will eventually probably sell them on on our site too. We'll probably see if maybe we can buy some from Steve Maxwell because I think in my opinion he's like one of the greatest kettlebell instructors alive. And I've had the good pleasure of being trained by him a couple of times so I can vouch for his staff. All of his videos are excellent. They're awesome. You can find them from Amazon and a bunch of different places but any Steve Maxwell video on kettlebell is you can't go wrong. Another one is extreme care about cardio workout that drag indoor cells. I fucking love that video too. We don't have anything to do with any of these videos but I'm just telling you if you want to buy some kettle bells. That's what I recommend go to on it.

Speaker 11:         00:04:42       Use the code name Rogan save yourself 10 percent off any and all orders the great Tom my rares here.

Speaker 12:         00:04:47       International Comedy Dick slang for my world to the Joe Rogan Experience. By. Joe Rogan podcast by. Oh powerful my rare.

Speaker 13:         00:05:03       Show you know we're always doing the Irish against each other. Yeah. Why is that. Why don't you go. We've been doing that for folks decades.

Speaker 6:          00:05:09       Well I went to Ireland right. I got to Ireland. Unbelievable. I mean it was like I thought I told you over the phone but I go in and I'm in Galway. Tomorrow. For fuck's sake we heard you with Joe Rogan we love the show. What key it goes. I started doing martial arts because a Joe you really have an effect around the world. This beautiful Galway Kilkenny. This isn't even Dublin.

Speaker 11:         00:05:32       Well you know what. I don't think men are represented fairly in the media. I don't think there's enough actual you know guys that are telling you what's what's really going on from their honest perspective. As someone that you can relate to. You know I think a lot of people are full of shit and I think a lot of men could use a martial arts training. It's good for you.

Speaker 6:          00:05:51       I think martial arts and comedy is a great great mix. It does work.

Speaker 11:         00:05:55       Yeah it seems like it wouldn't but it really does work. You know when I was when I was a martial arts guy only and I got into comedy I was almost embarrassed of being like having something to do with martial arts cause it seemed so do she. It doesn't seem like that would like that would be funny at all.

Speaker 6:          00:06:08       Joe even people that beat the shit that other people want to have a laugh they want to relax. Oh.

Speaker 5:          00:06:15       Yeah. Comedy is great for your martial arts. Great for you everybody and it's beautiful when I hear it stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          00:06:22       Somebody is always great. I got such a kick out of it. I mean it happened every night. Every night. Guys came because they heard me on the podcast. That's awesome. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:06:32       That's awesome. I get people sending me pictures of their kale shakes that drink kale shakes every morning. So I got a lot of people doing this. Kevin James got me on know Kevin James lost 80 pounds for this movie where he played an Indian a fighter. Yeah and looked fuckin fantastic his fucking face became thin. We always told me how strong he was. He's an animal. Kevin James loves to eat. He eats like a motherfucker. But physically that guy is a he's a bear dude. He's a big boned head. He hits hard. He's a big scary motherfucker and he you know he really could have been a fighter if he ever chose to go down that path. He has like serious power like especially in his hands. But he he hit mitts with Mark Dela granny and I was watch him hit them. It's like he's like a real athlete even though he's a guy.

Speaker 11:         00:07:16       So he lost all this weight and he looks so good I was so blown away I was like What the fuck did you do. And he said the most important thing is everything I switch to an all vegetable diet. Everything was vegetables. Everyday he didn't eat any animal products at all. And he did this for a long time. He went back to it eventually but he would have a kale shake every morning. And the idea was you you have this thing called a Vita makes you throw Kale Cucumber celery pears and then I throw ginger and garlic in there and borrow it and it tastes like ass. I mean it's barely eatable. You just sort of. Every time I do it it's like a little victory like there. I just get it. I got to that next. The next day I win again. You know every time I do it I feel like I win. But we had that good but I was just saying. But nutrient wise it's like incredibly dense. It opens up your bowels your shit comes out like like it's just a lubed up in on a right. You know one of those water slides and that's so it's like it's like your body feels like weight healthier water slides should till.

Speaker 4:          00:08:16       I've always wondered shit so spectacular my shit's when I have these you will get in white people tell you what are your shit things. I don't wish I did. I wish people could have if I could like record it and then play it back for you you could feel how great it feels when I see so Joy a Christmas you effortlessly pours out of my ass. And that's something to be back with the show. My shit's entirely green your kid it goes right through me entirely green. It's crazy. It's like man how clean is my asshole my asshole is like vegetable fresh Marchioness. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:08:46       So it's that's all I learned from Kevin and that's like people send me these pictures now all the time they're kale shakes like that. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         00:08:52       Like all the time on Twitter you know one with the dinner. You my kill suit to go with dinner at the Palm that night. Yeah. At the steak house. Yeah. Great point. I know this. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:09:01       Kevin was in a great mood talking lamp and as soon as the food came he was going to make him fucking look up by going his last meal.

Speaker 11:         00:09:08       Well that's when Kevin had gotten back to eating again. And that was because he had really like Christine he's all in and nothing. He's like Yeah he's kind of like me in a lot of ways. He's we're very similar and one of the ways is that we do crazy about things. You know he'll get crazy about golf and he's like FUCK HIM want to play golf all day every year. Well that's yeah you're like that in pool.

Speaker 4:          00:09:26       Yeah. And I got a real problem and starting a bottom up after three hours. Joe I'm tired.

Speaker 7:          00:09:31       I played a woman the other day and we only played a race to five. It was I kind of was such a tease I wasn't even warmed up yet it was how I can for me pool is like three or four hour experiment experience.

Speaker 6:          00:09:42       You have that long time. Like I said I said Do you have the marathon runner and I have a sprinter mentality like when I'm on stage if I'm doing really well I can't wait to get the fuck out because I'm doing really well. I went for 45 minutes I'm out of there. Bing bang boom. But like you love to be up there for a couple hours Yeah and it's great.

Speaker 11:         00:10:02       I mean I think only if I can maintain that energy and I've never seen you not. Well I think it's also you have to factor in the audience's energy so I don't do shows as long as I used to do. I've done some stupid like two and a half hour shows. And the problem often is people don't want to hear you talk for two and a half hours after a while they're bored. It's like and then the end of it it was always it always came like this. Question and answer section right. And if that felt to me like what I was doing was I was having this killer hour and 10 minutes a comedy and then I was ending it with like an hour of mediocrity and I was like This is like the question answered sometimes would be awesome but sometimes it would just sort of become a and yell fast.

Speaker 6:          00:10:39       People yelling shit and just become gross and well some of that you know the Dave Dave Chappelle thing with the five hours. Yes. I said to the I think it was up to seven. Okay whatever but some ridiculous and I said to the booker of the club I said that he did material. She goes it was all new material. This isn't one I don't believe that. So I asked the staff that go for material. He asked one guy where it was from three times the guy says I'm still from Pittsburgh.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       That's hilarious.

Speaker 7:          00:11:07       Well you know if people are willing to just sit there and you just sit around talking heads that still stand up you know it's like your standup is your You're a craftsman. When you go up there you've got jokes you got punch lines you got setups you got. You can't wait to get to them because they're killer.

Speaker 6:          00:11:25       But I have no idea how to write I swear to God. I mean I'm true. I don't I don't have any idea how to write a joke because it has to come out. In its own way. I don't know how to like mathematically you remember Rita Rudner. People like that are like joke technicians right. And I know you do know how to write a joke or you just say funny thing.

Speaker 11:         00:11:45       I just write what I do as I write and I write blogs like blog entries and then in the in writing about something since there's no pressure to be funny. Then I get the ideas for jokes out of that or I have ideas and I'll slowly work them out on stage. I do a bunch of different ways. Sometimes I don't have anything written. It's just this idea that's been fucking with me and then I go on stage and I try it one way and then I say well it was that that idea was misinterpreted and I'll try it another way the next time until eventually I get it.

Speaker 6:          00:12:13       I had dreams last two weeks of shit that was killing and my dream that we playing pool.

Speaker 16:         00:12:21       Oh yeah. That's another one since then.

Speaker 6:          00:12:23       But I was having this dream about organic alcohol. What was the one that you told me we were playing pool our relief pitcher.

Speaker 17:         00:12:30       Yes yes. I had this dream like and fucking 70000 people. And what's up with relief pitchers. I mean you know it's a relief if they get off. And I was like like such stupid non joke I know I'm fucking like it was a part of me that I think I knew I was asleep and I thought I can't wait to wake up to write this down oh no it's nothing it's nothing it was funny it was so funny it's funny and you were killing me.

Speaker 16:         00:12:53       It was real out of my fucking thought throngs of people I know I've done that before.

Speaker 18:         00:12:57       I know I've had dreams where I was killing on stage I could remember God is the best stuff I've ever written and I couldn't wait to write it down and I woke up like were you talking do you ever wake up laughing Joe.

Speaker 6:          00:13:07       Sometimes yeah I had a dream when I was first moved to New York and my dream was I had a job and was involved I had to sit and shoot to see how long scientists would stand around with these charts see how long it took soup to cool and it was chicken gumbo soup right. And I remember sitting in the soup was like fuck I. And then I sit down and I turn to the camera. There's a camera in my dream and I go 8 eight dollars an hour sitting in soup out bag and a big. Then I moved to New York and then the rest is history.

Speaker 11:         00:13:37       That's hilarious. I think if you laugh a lot and you used to laugh in a line it's more likely to get a laugh in dreams.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       Yeah I would have bought Chrysler just sits there and laugh like nonstop in his dream. I'll tell you why.

Speaker 5:          00:13:48       Is a happy motherfucker right now. That guy is that guy I've never met anybody who's like more thankful for like his success in life things that are going well in his life and so happy. He's such a happy nice guy.

Speaker 6:          00:14:00       I always wondered about guys who were always depressed like Marc Maron. Yeah I got a love more but Marc was one of those guys that was always so depressed.

Speaker 19:         00:14:08       Now he's successful and he's got a really nice girlfriend goes it's bother you guys I don't know what to do what my feelings because I'm so used these so used to be miserable.

Speaker 7:          00:14:17       It's gonna be careful man because all that is really bad for you all the years of and that's not like woo woo that's like that's real. New Years of harboring resentment and bad feelings and selfishness like that. All that negativity that fucks with you and keeps you from sleeping seems better to me though I'm sure it is. I'm sure he is I mean he's a smart guy he knows. I mean he's been one of the things is he doing a podcast where you read it very. Very openly bare your soul.

Speaker 14:         00:14:47       Yeah I mean he like when he does these like monologues where he talks about things in the beginning of his know his podcast he's being he's very honest about all of his transgressions and thoughts about him in the past and all sorts of different things. So I think it's like super therapeutic in a way to do something like that. Like you can really get over your shit when you broadcast it. Yeah you know and I I think I think we all have a tendency. It's so easy to go towards the negative. It's just so dangerous. It's so dangerous to think that that's the more profound way to think it's so it's so fucking stupid for you.

Speaker 6:          00:15:23       I never really let somebody else's success diminish me.

Speaker 11:         00:15:26       I just thought you never have. You've never been a jealous guy ever get anybody.

Speaker 6:          00:15:30       Somebody said one time about Eddie Murphy. Does it bother you that it would. Eddie Murphy. Do me. He's tremendously talented. It's not like if he didn't do 48 hours I would've.

Speaker 7:          00:15:40       Well you know I love he's loved about you Dom and not just that you were a great comic but you really loved standup comedy. Like there wasn't. There's always everyone had this idea at some point time in comedy that. You do. I mean not everyone but a lot of people in Hollywood you did you put together an act and then you got a sitcom and then you got a sitcom and then you went from a sitcom to a movie career and that's dealing with it do it and anyway else is not fun but you were like I like being a comic.

Speaker 6:          00:16:06       I'm kind of making plenty of money. I got a nice car and I live in a nice house like What the fuck you want for my need.

Speaker 13:         00:16:12       What do you want from me.

Speaker 15:         00:16:13       What else. Yeah. Well one guy says to me goes what else you got coming up every day this is like the deli man. What else what else. Another. That's all you got.

Speaker 9:          00:16:22       And I said them Look I like it. Nickelodeon really cool. They've got a movie and we're going to series because you got anything big coming up.

Speaker 18:         00:16:30       The first thing you've got coming up at Jiffy Lube a new muffler. I don't bother. I don't judge other people's career. It's a funny thing though. People will talk shit I've seen so many people talk shit on Twitter about random people's careers like whatever happened to our IP to this guy's career. Like who the fuck are you. Like Woody. What why is that. What is that weird free shot that's you know that's a bizarre thing.

Speaker 6:          00:16:52       Sportswriters who couldn't make their grade school football teams are critiquing guys like Roman Polanski critiquing guys that were great players you never played they never played anything well I'd critique fighters on there.

Speaker 7:          00:17:04       My fight kickboxing and taekwondo but I'm never following them I may fight. All I do is yeah but you wouldn't believe you if it came up when you were coming up it would have you would have fought them. Yeah I would have and I'd probably be a pig probably a mess right now. Right about now physically on there.

Speaker 6:          00:17:19       Forget the fight that I came to see you and the mother and the sister would sit next to me they're gonna get knocked down that's when reality hits you. When you sit next to the relatives.

Speaker 7:          00:17:28       Yeah well especially if they get badly cowed and so there's a visceral fear that comes from people getting badly killed because it looks like they're done. Guy gets head kicked or something. You remember with that fight in Vegas and the guy got hit and the ref caught him too. He was so light you remember it was Felix Trinidad. Really. Yeah yeah. We saw Felix Trinidad I forget who was fighting but it was when Trinidad was really coming up. It was when he was like I think it was a welterweight fight. Yeah. Caught him on the left hook bam dropped him.

Speaker 6:          00:17:59       Felix Trinidad had a wicked left and the ref caught up to one the ref called the guy before he hit the ground up to lead the back of his head. Then just the front of his head was.

Speaker 7:          00:18:07       Yeah we saw a couple great fights in Vegas. I don't remember who else we saw fight there but I mean we saw a couple good fights there. Boxing live is weird like you know I'm used to it at the UFC because I'm the voice of it. Yeah it's weird when you're sitting there and you don't hear any commentary. Yes watching guys just fucking get the shit kicked out of each other. Yeah. What you've seen is just the sounds of it s wet the blood. Yeah the impact sounds and the O's of the audience. Oh yeah. Oh shit.

Speaker 6:          00:18:34       I told you what I realized after seeing that stuff when I and I want to do it again you know I loved it but I love violence. I do. I love but. I just don't like fake violence so I don't like violent movies because I don't like that I don't like seeing somebody like Joe Pesci be able to beat some 25 year old stud because he's the star. Right. Right. Right. I don't buy that shit. Get out of here. You know it's like yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:18:55       You know Joe Pesci almost got beat up by the bouncer at the Laugh Factory. You know that story.

Speaker 15:         00:19:00       Yeah that was red. Red was the mulatto guy.

Speaker 7:          00:19:03       He looked like a human wall. Well this was a different story then because I'm talking about Ken big hand the rapper.

Speaker 6:          00:19:09       Well it was Ken. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:19:10       I thought was red because the one where he says you ain't never did it and I'm just saying no movie motherfucker. Anyways he was oh it was a. Yeah. You remember Kendra. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:19:20       Ken was a big fuckin do. Yeah. He's a football player and a rapper and apparently something happened and Joe Pesci got it. He tried to go crazy with them and got yelled at out of town. And Ken was like this fucking movie bit. And he got fired. Can't get fired. Did he get fired for that. Really. Wow that's sad. That makes me sad. Jamie Masada.

Speaker 10:         00:19:42       You'll have to come on the podcast and busters by it's only business body. I want you to come on that. What am I going to do about the body. That guy scream you scream at this guy's fucking movie star. People that see the podcast as saying who's the Mexican with you. It's good.

Speaker 7:          00:20:00       He's a crazy story. Jamie Masada the owner of the Laugh Factory was a dishwasher at the Comedy Store. Yeah. He decided to pull the other some money and start his own fucking business.

Speaker 3:          00:20:08       Kind of money did he get together.

Speaker 6:          00:21:25       I gotta do it. I'm starting to reach the depths of alcoholism.

Speaker 7:          00:21:28       I have for real. Yeah yeah well we talked about the whole Xanax thing. You can try marijuana Dominick. I think I do. I think you do. And I'm like I don't like smoke. I think you well you don't have to. You can eat it.

I always wanted to take a couple of hit various ailments. Well good luck maybe next time you do the podcast we'll plan it out. So I'm driving. You know to worry about driving anywhere and we'll bake you out on air okay. What do you think. Good pose. I get paranoid. Well that's very likely. That's very likely. But how much does it take to get you high. I'm just a little bit. Yeah. This is a really strong weed. You know they keep talking about that in the news and we've talked about this on the podcast before. There's the numbers of you know what the THC is so high that this is not your father's marijuana. It's totally true. It's fucking really strong weed now but it's still not going to hurt you. So I'm gonna kill you. How long does it take to weed out dangerous. It just freaks you out. You could take hours depending on your body. She's that's the only thing I don't like getting stuck in something. Yeah. If I don't like it. Well could be an issue. Stan hope that he doesn't like it.

Speaker 6:          00:22:43       Stanley Hey Tweed really sad like alcohol like anything down. Yeah. Did I tell you that when I'm being best friends is prosecuting the Sandusky case. Oh my God. And I knew about this like over a year and a half ago but they didn't. They had been big gathering up evidence and it's really interesting. I mean it's we were doing like roleplaying and trying to see what Sandusky would stay if he took the stand. His wife's on the stand today.

Speaker 9:          00:23:07       Well imagine. That's crazy. Oh my God. And like we're doing things like why would 10 kids you know embarrassed themselves that come out. Well I don't know. Maybe they misremembered it. I love that misremember what bullshit.

Speaker 7:          00:23:21       But it's so scary. The whole story is so scary because they protected him. Yeah they protected that guy. You know when when people freaked out when everybody went on a goddamn rampage cause Joe Paterno got fired. I wonder what information they had.

Speaker 6:          00:23:36       You know I mean Joe when you just go to the cops. Oh yeah. Well why would you go for the chain of command what is this Nazi Germany. I don't understand. I don't understand what coming down. I understand what happened and what why. What they said happened was he went to and another assistant coach went to his father and then they went to paternal paternal somebody else. I would've gone to the cops right away if I see somebody hurting a kid. Bam.

Speaker 7:          00:24:01       And then how do you not beat him to death right there on the spot. Yeah. You know that's gotta be an instinct too much. Who'd want to beat him to death. That guy's raping a boy. The whole thing is just so creepy if it really happened the way they're saying it happened. I mean I'm assuming at this point in time that he's he's guilty.

Speaker 4:          00:24:19       I just know that I not. Why would all these kids come in. Yeah you're right. No we have simply they didn't come from the same.

Speaker 7:          00:24:24       I'm not I would certainly not argue and I just you know for the sake of being fair the whole thing is fucking horrifying. It's so terrifying it's so terrifying that they had this monster and protected. Then they if that's really the case. Yeah that's so scary to me as well. Catholic Catholic Church type stuff. How else could they not know. I mean how could they not know.

Speaker 6:          00:24:47       The Catholic Church type stuff is fucking horrifying. We used to have a priest that molested us when I was a summer in summer camp. Really. You never got me because I was such a nut. I was always a light sleeper and afraid of the dark like a real man I would have a flashlight on under my under my sheets. So every night I slept real late you know. But he. And we knew about it and nobody said anything because he was a priest. Oh my God. And then they just had a whole thing about him. Even though he's dead they condemned his actions and stuff. And the Philly papers recently. What did he d to do. He would just like you know jerk off kids in their sleep or wouldn't play with them or whatever. God I don't think he. I don't think he did any of the Sandusky type level stuff because it was mostly a sleep thing. It's amazing when you find out how many of them. Oh my God. Yeah. Well apparently the whole. Not having sex thing.

Speaker 7:          00:25:36       Abstinence thing doesn't work. Well now is it not work like it's who is signing up for that. It's not like you go to a different heaven than me. All I have to do is be a good guy and follow God's word and I go to heaven to run and you don't get pussy. I get to fuck my wife and I don't get it. That's ridiculous. Yeah that's that's no net no natural person. Now I mean the something wrong with you is bad for your prostate. Not to come it is your prostate cancer. Yeah it's terrible.

Speaker 14:         00:26:00       And not only is it terrible like how how could an organization exist that has this many people to fuck kids could you imagine they just start it up tomorrow. Yeah the Catholic Church started up tomorrow and all of sudden you know there was no Catholic Church and then all suddenly said listen we just found this new religion. It's it's we're really sure this is what Jesus really meant.

Speaker 4:          00:26:20       And they just started fucking kids 20 percent of us kids director right away people would stop it they would go What the fuck are you doing. You can't you can't do this. That's

Speaker 6:          00:26:28       . You know with the shifting of the people was just as bad as some of the horrible they're putting a predator in a new area. Well that was Ratzinger. The guy was the pope right now. He was in charge of that shit. You know what he said. Yeah he said something about why did they cause Ireland. The churches are empty and they said Why. You know with so much molestation he said it's a mystery. What the fuck. What kind of answer is that. Like everything's a mystery.

Speaker 7:          00:26:53       It's a mystery. It's not a Miss Universe smarty Irish people are fucking smart. Yeah. That's why are smart they are smart. Smart as fuck. I love doing stand up there. There they are they're rowdy smart people. They're not they're not buying your bullshit. You can only fuck their kids for so long. The rest of world has to catch up.

Speaker 4:          00:27:09       That's right. Ireland's figured it out. Yeah. You can't fuck our kids.

Speaker 9:          00:27:13       That's all I was going to Kilkenny more than any of the other Americans. You know. I really know a lot of people are so far going to the grocery store next to the hotel and this Asian guy Cosby dumber and dumber and it goes to an Asian guy with an Irish accent.

Speaker 15:         00:27:28       It's half Irish have a I can't do it. He says it makes me want to try it. I think it makes me sad because done. This on me. We all don't. You'll come back again next year all right. I thought how fucking nice is that. Like a thousand miles away from my house. I've got a friend. Yeah. Give me a sandwich you know like. Thanks a lot Mr a free sandwich but it's really really cool of them.

Speaker 7:          00:27:52       What is cool when you go to a place and you develop like friends that you see like once a year. Oh yeah it is nice. That's nice aspects of the road.

Speaker 6:          00:27:59       Absolutely. I mean a little town Kilkenny walking down a street. Don't worry. Damn I heard I hit the USA Today for you I know you like the sports there. Because they're asked they don't like basketball they don't like they like soccer and hurling and Irish you know them hurling hurling is not it's not throwing up and it's like fucking rugby with sticks. Such a. Oh it's a crazy game.

Speaker 4:          00:28:22       Oh my God. Dude I've never heard that throw that shit up going rougher side side of lacrosse.

Speaker 6:          00:28:28       Irish people are savages. They're fun. I'll take you know I did Joe tell him to have a problem with drinking. I actually told the audience I give up. You win.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       I came here thinking I was an alcoholic.

Speaker 4:          00:28:39       I realized I'm a moderate social drinker people win. I've never met people less understandable that were speaking English than Northern Ireland. Oh yeah. Because they don't move their mouth like a ventriloquist. Oh my God look at this fucking game.

Speaker 7:          00:28:56       What are they doing. This is called hurling. Huh. Yeah.

Speaker 18:         00:29:02       The Kilkenny cats are the local team so they are why they must hit the fuck out of each other with those. Oh yeah. Oh my. And now shapes Nick look at oh this is crazy they're smashing a meaning each other three thousand years of sporting heritage. A lot of crazy ass came to beat the fuck out of each other with these sticks. Oh my God.

Speaker 6:          00:29:23       Oh and they run right into the full clip and that's why they think American football is such pussies because they have so much equipment.

Speaker 7:          00:29:31       This is this is the craziest game ever. I did not know this existed. How can I be alive for this long. There's no rules. This guy just grabbed the ball threw it up in the air and then hit it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       You say no rules or new rules no rules. These guys are animals.

Speaker 6:          00:29:49       How long. How long have you known about this. Since I've been going there you know I used to wear their shirt when I could still fit into it and when I was a mature Boy I hate seeing that look at me. The image I have no idea that I look like that. It's like a cat without whiskers that thinks they can get through any small space. I have no idea how bloated I am. My eyes look like they're half open. They say my doctor caustically only said to me I mean Craig Ferguson because he uses his old kind of language because say I'm it Ferguson You look like a Chinaman. I said who says Chinaman.

Speaker 7:          00:30:22       Yeah last time you were here you were talking I tell you I knew it well.

Speaker 20:         00:30:25       You said you were looking like an Inuit so you develop as cool like and I could still even that that look I could still get women because of my act. Thank God for my act powerful down my Rara. Were you just in Atlanta. I'm in Atlanta. I was in Atlanta this week. I went Great Priceline and and I'm in Atlantic City on the 30th and 30th of June at the Tropicana. Oh nice. I was telling my friend McGettigan that tickets available for that.

Speaker 7:          00:30:53       How do people get those tickets.

Speaker 6:          00:30:54       I guess just call the Tropicana box office post on my friend McGettigan who's doing the the Sandusky trial is there any way he could plug my date Lanark season. How can I do that I simply you know you go open with the ladies general jury your honor the spin Sandusky has caused so much pain to so many people.

Speaker 4:          00:31:12       Unlike comedian Dom rare who be at the trial on June 30th 8:00 o'clock. Tickets available would be hilarious. Could you imagine if you actually did. Yes. Holy shit. Talk about taking the credibility away from a trial. Yeah. I might fuck up the whole trial. They might they might get you he might get off.

Speaker 6:          00:31:29       They can't really joke around. Turns out I was reading some of the opening statements to me and somebody said What was he reading it for you to punch it up. I don't know. Just give it a bounce it off somebody I'm not.

Speaker 7:          00:31:40       But the point is that he's the prosecutor. Yeah he's the prosecutor can I send him all my positive energy. Get that motherfucker. He's there. Get him. He's a genius man. It's amazing that a guy like Sandusky is still alive. You know what all the negative show has done. How is his body still holding up. How is this though.

Speaker 6:          00:31:57       How about when he waves to people like he's running for office. He gets it. He's smiling and shit. I could see a psychotic he is. I mean if anybody else accused if you're innocent or accused of all this you'd be out of your fucking mind.

Speaker 7:          00:32:10       It's so weird to even think about it since it's so sick and gross. This is so few things in life that disturb people more than someone taking advantage of children. Oh I know that the whole futures that kids futures fuck you poising that kid's mind. That's the one thing in prison. They say that child molesters get their ass kicked. Yeah of course because a lot of people out there a lot of people to torture victims you know as children they can they said I love when people go I hope they do that to him in jail but it's gonna to fuck him.

Speaker 6:          00:32:42       They look at stretched out Grace. Oh.

Speaker 7:          00:32:45       I think they're going to kill him if he goes in general population. Yeah. They beat him to death. Sixty nine now right. Yeah. Yeah. And then they put him if they put him in you know silent solitary in isolation. I mean it seems like they're just going to convict him. I mean it just it seems like the evidence is pretty overwhelming.

Speaker 6:          00:33:02       I mean really the problem is with these kind of trials it has to be a hundred percent. It can't be a hung jury if one person is not sure then they have to do a retrial.

Speaker 7:          00:33:10       This one seems so crazy though it almost knee requires a second case it requires him to be guilty and then you to go back to the whole school and everyone involved you fucked in you see well that's gonna come down after this.

Speaker 6:          00:33:22       The president the guys who resign are gonna. Yeah. They have their day in court. Most paternal is dead right. Did he die. Yeah. He died. That killed them too. I mean he had cancer but I mean he would have he would have fought it. He just was of course a beaten man. I mean what a terrible position to be in. You know I didn't have it all those years at an incredible success and he was king of Nittany Valley you know Penn State and then boom fuck man. It just shows you the Santa fucking movie.

Speaker 7:          00:33:50       And movie. This world is strange it operates it's fucking strange and you know they're famous for their linebackers.

Speaker 6:          00:33:58       They call the linebacker you and he you know who was the coach the linebackers. Sandusky asking. You know he was a nice. He was an aura of revered revered revered revered coach. Don't let him turn into Irwin Corey remember.

Speaker 7:          00:34:13       I feel he was rabid. Wow that's nuts. Well there's a lot of guys who do really good at coaching because they really like men. Makes sense right. Yeah well. Well you know he's really looking out for him. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:34:27       People put themselves in situations like that's what's scary about it. Some people really do love kids and they love to see them successful. I mean I was a great fourth grade teacher because I fucking love the kids. I told them my son I don't care. I just do it you know. I want you to be happy. I self-esteem you learn this shit. Great. I said but let me tell you you're never gonna be in this. Some of this math is such bullshit.

Speaker 9:          00:34:49       I said you're not going to be in a bind go Man if I only knew the Pythagorean theorem I get that it is charming and it's better they have they're happy right. You know I just learned it's past marks because I don't wanna get in trouble. But basically I want you to go to the gym. Have fun in life. You know.

Speaker 18:         00:35:04       A good teacher. That's a great advice if you don't want be mathematicians for the rest of this year. Mastery issues are going to come out anyway. Kids that are a eggheads who are brilliant at it you know you just shouldn't force kids like that like me who had nothing. Is it possible to teach really complex things that just make it fun.

Speaker 6:          00:35:23       Yeah yeah. The only thing they couldn't understand. I could never get through to the kids was the relativity of up and down. Now there's no absolute up or down it's relative to a point because we're in the universe. Yeah. I mean like you know we're you know like people go Well that's it. They don't understand how people in Australia are not upside down. Right. Right. And I could never explain that. It was from a relative point but they're only nine 10 years old. Right.

Speaker 21:         00:35:46       Well it is hard to grasp the whole organic spaceship thing. Oh yeah. That we were all floating in here and we will we're looking for land looking for property Dom looking to settle down put a house down in this primary. Now there's nothing permanent stupid. The whole earth is a convertible. Yeah it's flying through the universe or a convertible that can be easily hit by another convertible. Yeah. They and it happens. That's the whole theory about the moon's creation. The most recent theory is that there was earth one and Earth one was like a fiery fuckin ball of flame or whatever the fuck it was different. I don't what it was about it was different than Earth 2 but it got hit by another planet. And that created the moon and changed the whole orbit of Earth and changed the atmosphere and that's the reason why everything exists today. I mean the reason why we're able to sustain life because our temperature is remarkably consistent because of the fact that we have a moon you know is it. Yeah. I don't know how it stays within a couple degrees. Yeah. That's part of it. Part of it is the moon. The moon keeps our orbit really steady somewhere or another like its gravity interactions. I don't understand it.

Speaker 18:         00:36:51       I don't understand gravity I mean we're supposed to understand what makes things float in space what makes things stick to those things. I used to have a fear when I went to the beach that I would be sucked up into the air and gravity wouldn't work just for me.

Speaker 16:         00:37:04       I saw it just that day. All of a sudden I'm going Fuck gravity. Thanks a lot. I can't get there.

Speaker 7:          00:37:09       Gravity is a crazy thing to wrap your head around that there's stuff floating when you get outside of the gravity of the Earth so you pass a certain distance from the earth where it no longer pulls on you you can float. Yeah like the earth has not that far. Not that far. So a few hundred miles right. I mean I mean I mean 30 miles or something. Yeah I think it's yeah just as soon as you get out of there. How many miles is making things up there. Three hundred miles is like space shuttle. That's like that's what the space. Oh it's the space shuttle. They go to like 250 300 miles. They go like somewhere around one man's crazy and then they you know obviously that's where the space station is you can float around up there but I don't know like at what height you can start floating.

Speaker 4:          00:37:50       When you come crashing to your death and what high can you just float around that causes. That's a real fine line man.

Speaker 6:          00:37:57       I was doing a roast with who's the first man on the moon Neil Armstrong. Armstrong I think was the owner of Jones was one of those guys. Buzz Buzz Aldrin Buzz Aldrin. I was a member of the Friars Club. Really I did a roast and I remember saying like What the fuck could scare you. You've been to the moon right. And I imagined sitting in a ship going boys were off to the moon today. If you really went to the moon to do it a second was it a Disney film. Joe are you telling us that nobody ever really went to the moon.

Speaker 7:          00:38:28       I think it's very possible that people went to the moon. It's also very possible they faked the whole thing. Well if they did it was like a best orgasm ever. They did a good job. They got us all excited. People think I'm retarded for taking this in their right I am retarded it's not retarded and how special. Thank you. Like uh like what is your name special so special.

Speaker 22:         00:38:52       Who does that song like to have a touch. Oh yeah.

Speaker 23:         00:38:58       Patton fuck the pretenders. Oh no. No not the pretenders.

Speaker 7:          00:39:06       Yeah I think it wasn't pretend it wasn't. It was. Fuck I can't remember them now. What was Tom Petty's band the Heartbreakers Heartbreakers. What I think he was a pretender heartbreaker. Yes I used to work with him when the old Garry Shandling Show. Well really I. Tom Petty is a Beatle songs together. I remember when I was a kid. I was about 13 years old and this girl was telling me how cute she thought Tom Petty was. And I'll never forget that sounds like Tom Petty. Chrissy Hines Chrissy Hines thank you. And I was like Tom Petty is such a bad motherfucker that this girls they think he's cute.

Speaker 6:          00:39:39       Well because he's like cute ugly because he's talented that's so true. It's the advantage of being a man. You think any guy goes Susan Boyle. And loud bang her. We get all the fucking awards she's won.

Speaker 7:          00:39:51       Well there's a few dudes out there that will marry you know famous famous monsters. There's a few girls that'll do that. That'll pick up like a good looking guy. It's kind of lost. Yeah. Yes that happens. That does happen. You get in limbo. This girls at us powerful women that have him both. I've seen that shit but it's not as common now. Not even close. Not even close. The women will genuinely legitimately be attracted to some like really successful gross guys. Thank you. I appreciate the garb for ourselves set me up it wasn't. I know you had something to say about the subject. It's a weird thing. Thank God we're meant to be a woman. Yes. Much more difficult really difficult.

Speaker 9:          00:40:34       I mean the whole thing about makeup and getting ready.

Speaker 7:          00:40:38       Oh I was out of fucking. I was on my own I want to say where it was. I ran into a woman that was very hot in the 1970s and now she's uh you know now she's get along in her age and she's got all this plastic surgery and shit. And it was so weird to see some famous person I wanna say your name not Joan Rivers. I won't say it now wasn't Joan Joan Rivers looks like a cat now like a space cat. This looks like an alien. Sounds scary. It's weird option. Yeah and I wonder if what she's doing that that's permanent. Can you can you know it's permanent. Yeah it's permanent. You can't like relax and stop stop doing what you're doing that makes your face like that. No I remember I work with somebody who I love who I did.

Speaker 9:          00:41:22       I don't want to really go into it but she had had plastic surgery and kept denying it. Yeah when she smiled her when she left her face didn't move. She'd go.

The crowds are amazing and we've got some great fans smart. I'm saying they're smart because they laugh at us.

Speaker 11:         00:45:09       Well we're super lucky. You know I don't know why we pulled it off somehow or another but it's it's by. Its by its by what those guys in Ireland were saying it's fine just.

Speaker 7:          00:45:20       Telling people you know what's helped you. Telling people what you're what you're really into. Stop pretending. Everybody tell the goddamn truth. My nephew is 20 and he he's never been more excited about me being on anything. Since Hey Arnold.

Speaker 6:          00:45:34       Right. When he was a kid it's like you know cause they don't really relate to it like everybody loves Raymond and Seinfeld and all they don't relate to any of those credits they would love this they live like you with the top.

Speaker 15:         00:45:44       You know I am a guy who's funny and may have me the American Medical Association. See I've got to have a good act. Joe thank you for your therapy.

Speaker 7:          00:45:58       Well that's awesome. Well if anything we could do to to you know make this world a little bit better places. Help the young man help the young men that are coming up to give him some sort of fucking perspective that's different than the one they're getting every day either at work or at school or in the media getting this perspective that you have to be some asshole doesn't exist. Yeah some guy who doesn't exist you have to fuckin you know you have to abide by their silly laws of political correctness. He can't tell the truth he can't. He can't be honest about what you like. You know it's it's a fucking terrible place where people have to live in and just as shitty state of despair all the time. It's not necessary.

Speaker 6:          00:46:39       I like to watch two women sometimes I get a little lazy. How do you like what you do.

Speaker 7:          00:46:44       Well like a video. Well it doesn't really do it for me. No no I don't. I mean I guess if they were right there in real life I really was gonna watch. I've only seen it once in real life. I've seen a couple of times but once that was like a video where they were actually making a video and it was like one of the most sexless things I've ever seen. Oh you saw filming it. Yeah. Yeah it was real weird. It was. They were they were doing one of the dudes who is a writer for news radio was a porno writer.

Speaker 18:         00:47:14       Oh yeah. No writer. He's. You think you're gonna score.

Speaker 7:          00:47:18       He dated a bunch of girls that were in the business and it was this is a long time ago. It's like we're talking about like ninety.

Speaker 24:         00:47:26       Four I guess somewhere and then and he broke up with his girl because they were out at dinner and this is when reality set into him.

Speaker 7:          00:47:37       They were out at dinner and she was like just like really tired and she wasn't and it was like What's matter is I say something like Oh no it's just how did you know with this guy all day and so scarred she still can hate that and all he could think of was I can't wait till Friday. How does that even fit in right to the world that I'm living in. How is it that the woman I love is taken taken Dick in her ass all day and where I know.

Speaker 9:          00:48:02       Like what. Yeah it's not quite the job I remember we were at the Riviera Steve Shaw Report was there and you know he did want to go up by me. He did what he had. Steve is very faithful to his wife and you know Steve right. Yeah sure. And he. He tells me you want to go and watch them chew porn or up in the penthouse. I'll get chipped. I said Yeah I got. I go in and this girl's peeing on this other girl. I go wow this is romantic. Where are they in the tub or something. Yeah. And then that night we had. We went up there and me and Sophie Sophie wanted to see my girlfriend you know. And the girls needed so much attention when they weren't getting attention as one girl lays down on the piano it's because you want to see my trick.

Speaker 6:          00:48:41       And she put a you know this is a cigar holder. Like a little capsule that they put cigars in like a metal thing. She put it inside of her and she popped it out but she shot it so hard it fucking hurt the girls.

Speaker 16:         00:48:54       Farhad You stay in there. Go go go go. Do you imagine the block left a permanent mark. What happened to you. I don't wanna talk about it.

Speaker 7:          00:49:06       Oh shit. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 9:          00:49:10       Yeah. But you're right about having the wife and you know a husband and wife and when one of them does porn and the other doesn't and both the US weird is weird.

Speaker 7:          00:49:18       So this dude took me to the set and these girls were doing it and it was Jill Kelley and Janine sadly did say you know who both the fan. They're both beautiful Janine is really yeah. And this was back in the day. She only had no she had any tattoos. Maybe she had a couple but now she's like fully sleeved and shit. Oh yeah I know. Yeah it's weird but. And they were just two girls like each other out. So I was like this is just so strange it feels so that the music and the whole the whole thing while watching the camera you know circle them and seeing the lights and the guy with the boom mike. I was like This is so odd. It just seems so strange. Anybody got the gum. It was just real close. Well it's almost like clinical or something yeah. Of course it didn't seem like you know like if these are two girls and they would just sit on the couch and all a sudden one girl just started eating the girls acid below. Well what the fuck. Like you'd be nervous right. Like what is happening here. This is crazy. But to watch it like to go and like it's sort of orchestrated an action. OK. You know I want two fingers now. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Spit on it spit on.

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       Player s. Frazier. I was at the I was at the magic castle and a friend of mine and this one of the dancers from the shirt tour came in who I knew four years ago.

Speaker 9:          00:50:37       So I can just say that because there's so many of them and we go back to my house and we're by the pool table. And Kristie you know my old girlfriend comes out and I shouldn't say her name. Well it doesn't matter it's not her last name. Still love you. And she has puke breast and she took her bra off and just had a T-shirt on there sticking straight out and the girl just casually walks over to her lips and starts sucking it.

Speaker 19:         00:51:03       Oh and me and my friend Ali would just like they're like holy shit. And you know. I mean.

Speaker 6:          00:51:12       Russell Peters always does that joke about like acting like he's gonna jerk you up as a joke. We say we take care you date tough guy. And I mean that is just so odd. And it was sexy to a point and then one of the girls wanted to go down the other one. That's right Julie line.

Speaker 7:          00:51:27       Imagine if there was so as many like really openly bisexual men as there were openly bisexual just different it's different. Well it's different because it's bullshit because a lot of them aren't really bisexual. Some of them are.

Speaker 12:         00:51:39       For sure you are just a lot of women a.. I'm saying they're fake and not an act for us now.

Speaker 7:          00:51:45       Zee Don't break my family and there's no stigma attached to it. No social stigma. You know some girls genuinely like girls of course but there's a lot of fake lesbians out there. We all know that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       I know the girls are in the porn that our girls are all real.

Speaker 25:         00:51:59       I mean yeah yeah I mean all that although a lot of them. Yeah. Not all those girls you can't say most of us. I mean if they if they're not gay they tell you.

Speaker 21:         00:52:06       Well I'm not talking about girls that are like into hardcore sex either. I'm talking about girls like making out with girls in bars and chilling out. Well they don't actually do anything.

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       Oh yeah. Yes a lot of that going on when they're doing a fashion.

Speaker 6:          00:52:16       Well you ever hear of lugs lugs lugs. It's a phrase in high school and college girls use it's lesbian until graduation. No. Yeah. And like a lot some girls too.
