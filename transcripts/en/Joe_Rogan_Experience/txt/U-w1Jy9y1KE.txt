Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Yeah. How's that? Is that it? Is that for real?

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       I always wondered when I was a little kid, why do American Indian songs sound so like, like what is that?

Speaker 3:          00:00:15       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       And then I realize they're high as fuck cause when you're high as fuck then it seems like it sounds kind of cool. Jesus dude. Sounding really cool right now. Rogan. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:28       Yay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       What though? The rattling sound that you hear Lacey gentleman is an actual bottle of Alpha brain.

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       Oh, do not. Well you also hear my fucking laptop in the background because I'm retarded. This is, this is Outbrain. This is what I take before I do anything cause I'm an Alpha brain junky. Ladies and gentlemen, I take the shit before I do standup. I'm not lying about this by the way. I take this before I do any podcasts, any UFC. I've done you fcs before without him and I panic a panic. I got to go with extra red bull and me and Mike Goldberg make fucking, we have races to see who can get to the bathroom first. Rebel goes right through you. I said, double stack it. This is not a red bull type feeling. If you're wondering what Alpha brain is, it's essentially nutrients that enhance your ability, your, your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters. It's all different nutrients that have been shown to have a positive effect on brain function.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       It is a very controversial subject. Um, I've, I've looked at both ends of it. I've talked to people who think it's a placebo. I believe that everybody's body works completely differently. I know that some people can eat peanuts and have a great old time and other people eat them and they're fucking dead. I don't understand that. But what I do understand is what benefits mean and what has been shown to benefit people and what, what has a long history of human use. And that's all the ingredients inside Alpha brain. To go and check this out, go to [inaudible] dot com it's o, n, n, I, t, and all of it is explained to you. And the way, the only reason why I would be in business with anybody, and this is this includes Tang, which we, you know, we're in business with sometimes or audible or you know, any of the alien where any of the people that we, we, we talk about on the show, even that we don't get money from like h two o or a c two o rather see, oh yeah, water.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Does he give us any money? Those kinds of, she bitches a c two oh, coconut water. It's fucking delicious. They're great. Grillo's pickles. They're fucking the most delicious pickles on earth. I, if, if I tell you it's because it's true to me. I believe it 100% there's news. I've been wrong about shit before. Trust me. But I'll tell you that too. If I am wrong, I'll absolutely fucking telling you I'm wrong. Alphabet. I'm not wrong about the fucking dreams that you have. First of all, that's, I would take it just for the dreams. If you'd take it and then go to bed, you have the most intense graphic dreams. They're intense and they're, they're very lucid man. And I don't know what it is, but it's not bad for you. That's all you have to worry. It's all just nutrients. There's nothing crazy in there.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       There's no pharmaceutical drugs is nothing to addictive. Can tell you about a story about one of the dreams. I gave something to my Russian housekeeper and she took them and she went back to a lot via 1965 and spoke to her grandfather. Whoa. In the dream, the lucid dream. And she came back the next day and she's like playing with the fuck Jesus Christ. He's lucid. Dreams are no joke. They don't know. They don't always happen though. I've taken it before and had nothing. I've had no dreams. Um, I don't, I don't understand the process behind her dream. It was so intense that you inside your dream found out a way to delete it so you won't remember it, baby. Yeah. Well that's, you know, that's the mechanism behind dimethyltryptamine. The mechanism behind dimethyltryptamine is the same mechanism behind a dreams, which is really weird. How, you know, how you can wake up and you're like, fuck, what a dream I had, man.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       We were on roller skates, we were running from Godzilla and it was my cousin who I grew up with, but I haven't seen him since I was 13 he's like, why didn't you call me? And I felt fucking guilty. Meanwhile Godzilla's chasing us and you could remember it. But then if I came up to you like a half an hour later and I said, tell me what that dream again. You'd be like, well fucking train mas it again. Shit. What happened? Hate. Fuck. It's weird. It's like your brain erases it. It's like whatever it is is based on something that the brain is already really good at getting rid of. And that DMT DMT, which is a crazy psychedelic drug that your brain makes. And it's also, you know, available in plant form. But the idea is that when you are, you're dreaming intense dreams at what's going on is your brain is producing dimethyltryptamine, your brain is producing this hallucinogen and nobody really understands what it's about.

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       And some people actually believe that, you know, there's an old term called sleep on it. You know, if you have, you have something that's bothering you, sleep on it, and maybe you come up with a good decision in the morning. A lot of the reasons for that term is because you really do think about things that are troubling you and while you're sleeping and if you are tripping, if that is what's happening when you're sleeping, if we're all growing through a DMT trip, that is a race by the time we wake up, which is a distinct possibility considering the weirdness of dreams and what, what are they, the ones that seem really real, what are, what are these, these are obviously hallucinations, like really intense hallucinations but in a much more controlled form then like say a DMT state. Well it could just be, it's a low level of DMT experiences, certain um, eastern religions which believe that the life we're living now is actually just the dream at your highest self is having, which I find very interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       It's just as likely as being alive, being alive. It's pretty fucking bizarre. Being able to measure things so you're fucking eyeballs and figure out where things are. All of that is, it's weird as shit, man. Being a human is weird as shit is fucking crazy. Dreams are weird. It's weird that you shut off every night. It's weird to for eight hours. We just accept that we're going to just normal and you look forward to it. Everybody's scared to die. No one's scared to take naps. Just fucking shut. Right. I used to go to sleep as a kid. I'd be like, Oh shit. Here it comes. I don't know why Alpha brain gives you a of, so you can send me with tenure

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       with us, but it does. It gives you crazy fucking dreams. Shroom tech support is another great product from on it. It's my favorite product as far as like a athletic performance. It's based on a quarter steps. Mushroom, plenty of data out there after interested in googling it. Um, the quarter zips mushroom is also the same mushroom that makes fucking ants that like makes them zombies and makes their heads explode. Different strain of different strain folks. It comes out. You don't have to worry about that. You ever seen that? Yeah. There's a branch of the quarter steps mushrooms that infects these uh, ants. Fascinating shit man. And it turns a turns. The ants and the like, these Zombie ants and the other ants have to get the body when these things die and get them whey the fuck away from the ant hill because they explode out spores, which they affect all these other ants.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       What are you saying? Welcome to the call for. Okay, listen, I'm not saying that it's not the same. It's not the same thing. Imagine if that's how we're doing. Your honor would say they're doing mine control in the form mushroom mind control. It's not that folks. That's what it was, man motivators. Aubrey brands, 29 year old dude had it all figured out. We're going to have fucking for flashlights in the future. His hands. Listen folks, I don't listen to that guy. He's crazy. But we also have kettle bells, which are recently in and battle ropes. That's all. Everything we sell is the highest quality shit possible. You can't get any better. And we tried to sell it to you as cheap as possible and make the deal as easy as possible. With all the nutritional supplements. There's a 100% money back guarantee in the first 30 pills.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       You don't have to send them back and just say this stuff socks, because nobody wants to rip you off and we're only selling you the best shit and I guarantee you if you start using it, you're going to appreciate the effects of it and you're gonna or you're some fucking weird or the candy peanuts. I don't know. I don't know what your deal man. Go to [inaudible] dot com use the code name Brogan and you'll save yourself 10% off the supplements and you will save nothing off battle ropes and kettlebells cause them shits is expensive and don't use the code name London real on this show. Wait for our show. Yeah, if you use the code named Lyndon Real, do you get something? You get like 10% of us and then Joe offsets in the parking lot later going off through the words that keep on code cock block. It is a coupon code, cock block exercise.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       It would be if we were all like go on some sort of a percentage of sales basis. That's why you would want to use the word olive garden. Fuck you. Get, they charge you more. They say that son of a bitch charge him double. We were told we were told to olive garden before Brian did new percent you, they charge you more. Do you, can I get a call? I'll keep on code that charges $10 more on your order, but it just donates the death squad. That would be hilarious. Yeah. That is the other thing. We're sponsored by desk squad. Dot. TV is Brian's site or Brian makes these ridiculous cat tee shirts that, I see it all my shows now

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       that that is a, that those are all his designs and the money goes to Brian to support his death squad podcast network and you're like, what the fuck is a desk squad? It's a very vague in strange, strange topic, but we got Kevin Tomorrow. Yes, Kevin prayer come a part of it. The desk that squad is, it's just a nickname that was given to us a long, long time ago and it's now sort of branched out into Brian's podcasts and, and it's still like, it's a family, you know, that's what really desk what represents to all of us. You know, when we, when we talk about if we put death squad under a post and it's Joey is and Ari and Brian and Dunkin are all on a show together, you know, that's, that's what we call it desk. While here it's family. It's just like the hall of Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       It's like subliminal the motherfucker. He entered into my mind with an olive garden commercial olive garden, will you please pay this fuck olive garden? What do we, what do we have to do? And he's gotten them saying it. Brody Stevens is recommending the olive garden on the fucking Chelsea handler's show you sons of bitches get off your ass and sponsor this kid. He's the number one olive garden. Support it in the country. Essentially. I don't understand it, but I also don't understand that just for men commercial where the fucking baby has a beard and drives a car. I don't understand that. There's a lot of shit. I don't understand. Have you seen that commercial? We'll talk about that. Listen, you know how it was in London. London real is here. Strap the fuck in. We're fixing to get shit. Pop and desk. Squad. Dot TV for the tee shirts. Stickers represent a desk squad all over the country that you guys were there in North Carolina and I saw you in Toronto. All you fucking freaks. Alright. Cue The music. Sun Experience.

Speaker 4:          00:10:40       Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast. Gentlemen,

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       welcome. Welcome. Thank you to be, it's awesome to be so good to have you guys here. Um, uh, I, uh, saw you guys on youtube a while back. Uh, I don't remember what the f I just, just say that the gentleman, Brian and nick, who's Brian who's name, I'm Brian Rose from London real. These guys are, uh, one of the coolest up and coming podcast that I've had a chance to listen to and uh, really, uh, is fucking right up our alley. The stuff you guys talk about, the people that you have on, you know, you had shock filet on, you had uh, you had Graham Hancock on fresco. You mean, did I say, I'm sorry, which one is Jack Valet? No frescoes in 96 year old frescoes. The Venus project and a project guy. Yeah, sorry, Mr. Shock. Uh, but you've had a, you know, you had Graham Hancock on, you guys have had some just right up our alley guests.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       It's really, uh, it's, it's beautiful to see that there's more out there that there's people that are doing this in London. You know, there's people that are doing this in Toronto. I ran into a lot of people in Toronto that have podcasts and it's essentially, it's all the same thing. It's like, you know, you get together and you go, women, I would like to talk about some shit that I don't see talked about in the mainstream news. Like there's all this nonsense in the news about celebrities or about parts of the world that really don't even have anything to do with our day to day lives, but there's all these other weird subjects that aren't getting covered. You know, there's so much, it's fascinating things about like what, wait, what? What's going on with the psychedelics? Like what is this? What? What are they here for? What's this all about?

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Because this, can this be a debate for intelligent people to sit down and talk or does it immediately get derided and, and, and reduced to some silliness to some, oh yeah. What were you going to take a loosen a Jones? Yeah. Why don't you just fucking, why don't you get up in the morning and put a tie on like a gentlemen, you know, to Hancock about that. As soon as I mentioned I Wasco or anything, everyone's eyes just glaze over and they're like, oh, you're one of those guys. Yeah. They think you're a crazy person. If you want to talk about altered states of consciousness, you're a crazy person in California too. Yeah. Well, it's a little better here. It's a little better here. Um, this is the most progressive spot in the country, I think as far as like the ideas of, I have a feeling about humans in America and the, it's not that there's not amazing people on the east coast.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       There's amazing people all throughout the country, but I think there's a, there's a prevailing attitude of the, the region. Like people always talk about liberals in California. Well, the reason why is because like in the east coast is where all the people first landed, right? That's where all the people from Europe are like, Fuck Europe or so done. There's a new spot. They can't fuck with you. We're going to make our own laws. And that got all crazy and conti and people just decided to keep going. And a lot of people kept going and they just kept going. They eventually on fucking horses with wooden wheels got all the way to the other side and we're like, fuck, we can't go any further. All right, let's stop. People complain when the transatlantic flight is delayed by 30 minutes. And then it was what would the ancestors went through, right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Yeah. They had to eat each other. Man Eat each other and the milestone with eight each other. That sound, that's no joke, man. It was a scary time for human beings and I think there was a lot of times where, you know, people would start out and not make it. They would try and a scary time for human beings though, Joe, and this is a scary game. We're all playing, right? It is. It's the same scary game we were playing when I was in high school, when I was in high school, was about the Soviets. It was always, you were talking about that recently. People Forget. I mean, I used to go to sleep at night, really worried about nuclear war. How old are you? I'm 41 you ever see that movie? The day after it was on, I was like 10 or 12 it was his whole television movie about basically a nuclear war and the end of it, I mean, I stood up.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       I was up for days. I don't remember that one in particular, but I bet I saw it. I've seen so many of them. I've seen so many apocalyptic mad max type movies where the, for some reason, you know, I am legend type shit goes down and we just, you think America needs an enemy. Like do we need someone to kind of always be the bad guy? Well, we're not real. So when you say it, does America need an enemy? America's not even real. It's, there's just a bunch of humans and they did decide to call it American act as a group, but it's pretty obvious at this point that it's, that's not real. It's us. That's real. It's humans and he might as well be you guys when you hear your Americans, it's like, what? What is America? It's just a fucking spot. It's just a spot.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       And the idea that this spot acts as one unit and, and, and we should all go along with what the spots doing. That's fucking completely ridiculous because we don't get a say it's, and what they're doing is completely contrary to what most of the people in this country would want to get done. So what we have is like a fake country and we have a really a dictatorship. That's run by money and it's just run with a loose grip. It's not run with a dog collar around your neck, so you constantly feel oppressed. It's run with a loose grip of corruption. It's a loose grip of corruption and entanglement where there's no way to get into the system where a guy like Gary Johnson, who's the only one left running for president who makes any fucking sense. The Libertarian candidate can't even get into the debates because they won't treat them seriously because the media is really fake.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       The media is really bought and sold and it's a news program. It's a news program where they pick and choose what aspects of the news, what angle of the news instead of giving you all the information and anything that has anything to do with criticizing America or anything that shows American a bad light is all got to be reviewed before it's put on air. It shows, you know, while I was watching you while you were giving that speech, I just really felt that you really want people to wake up. You rarely odd tarnation wake up to, they can't operate like this. They don't have to. The news doesn't have to operate like this. The government doesn't have to operate like this. The corporations don't have to operate like this. No one's saying you can't do business. What we're saying is business doesn't mean you have to fucking rob people.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       Business doesn't mean you have to use lobbyists to influence policy so that you can pollute rivers. Business doesn't mean that you can store nuclear waste in the middle of the fucking desert because you don't know how to get rid of it. You're not supposed to do any of that stuff until you know how to get rid of it. Don't make it. You know, we should really probably shouldn't even be on fucking nuclear power because we've had several major incidents over the past 100 years. 100 years ain't shit when it comes to how long the fucking earth is and how long radioactive material lasts. So if you're having nuclear, if they've put together these power plants that if something goes wrong, that spot is poison for 100,000 years. You cannot live there anymore. And then even after a hundred thousand years, who's going to be that first of fucking move back there?

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       If we've keep an any sort of accurate records whatsoever, who the fuck is going to be the first person to move back to where there was a nuclear disaster and power plants imploded? No one, no one's going to do that. So that spots ruined essentially for longer than humans have is existed. That's, that's how long we've ruined Chernobyl. That's how long we've ruined Fukushima. We're ruining the spots. I, and it's, there's a lot of power plants, man, hundreds of them all over the place and they could all equal a spot where one day you can't go anywhere near them. We're, we're assuming we're going to be able to keep the power on indefinitely and Cooley's fucking things off. That's why they've built them. Yeah. But it's in human nature to only change our behavior when something really bad happens. It's just the way it is.

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       Right. What's fascinating, it's a, it's just an aspect of denial, you know, it's in, that's how corporations work. The reason what corporations are able to get away with the shit they do bribe politicians and and and, and influence, literally wore and murder is because they act as a group that's just trying to get zeroes and ones, they're just trying to get money so they don't look at things in terms of like their moral value. They look, they look at things in terms of is this good for our stockholders? Is this good for our business? Can we make a profit here? Can we get over there? And when you have companies where you know, you get a guy like Dick Cheney who's the fucking head of a company called Halliburton that fix his shit up after it gets blown up and then this guy becomes the vice president and just starts blowing shit up and then giving these contracts with the company that he used to run.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       That is one of the craziest things that's ever happened in front of human beings. W there was, it was essentially a jacking on television live publicly and government sanctioned where they jacked a whole country and jack the American people to and made us give money to these corporations that would fix shit that we blow up and even build shit that's not necessary. Have you talked to people that are over there? They'll tell you that they just have like a certain amount of money they're supposed to spend and they have a certain amount of projects that they can build a desalinization plant that people like, we don't fucking need this. Like we're building it. You know you need it, you want it. It doesn't matter. We were building a desalinization plant cause we've got the contract for it and there's just billions of dollars is going over their billions and billions.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       Neil degrasse Tyson had a speech where he was talking about that we have the capability now we have the knowledge and the knowhow to build a telescope that literally can go back and look at the beginnings of time. Like we can build a telescope that is just infinitely more powerful than anything that exists today would cost about $10 million, $10 billion to, you know, it sounds like an incredible amount of money until you find out how much money to spend in Iraq. And they spent 10 million billion dollars every few days. I was just constant of of species must have a really a really negative comma because we have so much potential, but we just seem to channel it in the wrong direction. And maybe, maybe it's not us. Maybe it's just a comma that we're burning through. We have to go through all this shit. It's not us, it's just the look.

Speaker 1:          00:20:30       The business of running countries has not changed. Although the access to information has changed radically. So the understanding of what a country really is, it's changed radically. But the business of running countries has not changed to same thing that they did during the Roman empire they're doing today. They're just doing it through a loose series of guidelines. But it's really clear that they're robbing country's resources, controlling people's militaries, attacking people mercilessly, putting fear and terror. And you want to talk about Orwellian, we have fucking robots that we operate with remote control from the other side of the planet that shoot missiles from the sky that kill people like that is bananas. The fact that that's one of the major ways that we rocket. In 2012 we literally sent fucking Darth Vader spaceships that shoot rockets from the sky. That is the, that's insane. Do you ever get concerned that you might have or you might face repercussions from the US government one way or another for the views you're promoting their show?

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       Well, no, because I just, it's everything that I'm saying is all obvious. It's all right out there in the open. It's not, I mean like if you want to look at the Halliburton thing, it's not like that fucking Rogan. He gave up the goods on Halliburton. Everybody knows that Halliburton has a completely corrupt, the, the, the, the relationship that Halliburton to the United States is completely corrupt. Just by virtue of the fact that they got no bid contracts, these enormous, enormous contracts. Like that's not the taxpayer is being looked after. That's not the government being frugal or being conservative with money. That's a relationship between someone who influenced either directly with money or indirectly by getting their former CEO to run the country. I think the idea of a corporation has a good thing. I just think we need to regulate the fuck out of him.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       It they have to, they have to have a good mind. I mean from a just a limited liability corporate standpoint. I mean you do believe that there is a reason for them because otherwise if you couldn't, she couldn't invest in on it and then otherwise they might come and take your car away. I think it's unlimited lives. I think. I believe, I believe in paying taxes. I pay my taxes. I never cheat on my taxes. I pay a lot of money in taxes. I pay, I believe in, I believe in state taxes too. I mean, I think I pay state taxes in California. I know a lot of people that move to Nevada strictly because they don't have to pay state taxes and stuff. I don't mind paying for things. I don't mind government. I think it all can be done correctly and but it's all going to be done.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       It sounds Corny as fuck, but it's all going to be done with love. It can't be done with fear and it's all being done with fear. The whole way the world is being done is being done with fear and it's everybody's like, fuck you, I'm going to Nuku. If there were people that would be the most ridiculous people ever. If I ran an Israel with people, you'd want to kill the both of them. You'd be like, well, you to just shut the fuck up. My God. You bickering cunts. You next door neighbors who just, you're a fucking baby. You're a baby. This one asshole has a cartoon bomb he's using in a UN speech to show when it gets to here, that's one we're in trouble like I, it's a bomb like showing Iran's nuclear capabilities. If you've seen this now is this, let's pull this up. Brian's doing Netanyahu. That mother fucker, that's silly bitch Netanyahu, who's the the, what does the prime minister of Israel. He's showing like when we have to attack Iran, he's got this nuclear bomb and it's like get

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       to a certain point and that's when you got to attack. They're just, I mean, they're insecure over there and they're like pawns in a little chess game that had all the big powers are playing in the same zero Yahoo, Yahoo, Yahoo. Yeah. Netanyahu bomb cartoon joint Israeli Palestinian podcast. I think it would just need him talk. It's, yeah, that's, that's the, that's the, the, the conflict to end all conflicts. That's the conflict that's going been going on forever. It's like it's never going to end that whole Middle Eastern coffee. Look at that. Look at that picture. Okay. That's, is that the most ridiculous shit ever? He's like, well, this is it. When I'm in a job said it's childish and I agree with them in a job. How about that dude who says no Iranian gaze? He doesn't believe in gay marriage. She's, I believe, who knows what the Holocaust gyre is really said. Is he a holocaust? Jesus Christ. Meanwhile, I believe in him when it's his taste tasting cartoons is excellent. At least you're honest. It just, it seems like, you know, so

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       if, if, if, if corporations and governments all sort of have this diffusion of responsibility and even though we're in America, all the things that go on that we don't agree with, like drone attacks and all the shit, you know, it all, it becomes a matter of how much of an impact does that have on the rack, the whole rest of the population. And if it only has a minor impact on the rest of the population, a lot of times he can get away with it. And that's the situation that we're in right now. We know that too. In order to change things, who would require a major overhaul and it would be really difficult for a lot of people. I mean, the government is comprised of a huge amount of, of human beings. There's a lot of people that essentially are completely unnecessary. If we had a real Justin true government, they're really not necessarily, I don't really believe in conspiracies.

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       I think it's just people have these positions where they had these great jobs and they're collecting money as a contractor. Halliburton and whites. Why change things? Yeah, there's a lot of that, but there's also conspiring. We know they conspired with Enron and essentially Halliburton was, they were allowed to conspire Halliburton's clear conspiracy. But we also know a lot about government conspiracy from the past. That's not just like ideas and thoughts, but stuff that actually has been proven to have happened. Like the Gulf of Tonkin. They'll, they'll, you know, the, the, the idea that they got us into a war in Vietnam with like a fake story. They've got the operation Northwoods operation dirty trick, which is where they were going to blow John Glenn was going to be the first person into orbit and if anything happened to his, his space shuttle, his, uh, his rocket, they were going to blame it on. The Cubans were going to blow up like some fucking, it was a reason to attack Cuba. We were like, look, it's a win win. If John Glenn makes it, he's the first guy in space, you know, if it doesn't make it, we blame it on, the Cubans would go fuck him up. And that was, that was the plan. And this is not a conspiracy. This is like this is written document. Do you think the government

Speaker 5:          00:26:43       needs some secrecy? Otherwise there's no diplomacy. I mean you can't have a policy but it means Obama can announced the night before he's going to go in and and you know assassinate and that has to be some kind of, I don't, first of all, I don't believe they did really loud. No Dude's good debt. I've talked about people. If I had to say, I would probably say that more than anything else that Joe blow is fishing. I've talked to dudes who are in special forces type jobs and they were like, that guy's been dead forever. They're like those guys. But I dunno what the fuck happened. And dudes were laughing about it. Like was tell him, write that story. Nope, didn't sound right to anybody in any other country either. Because you hear about that guy that wrote that book that's like a national best seller that he was one of the guys.

Speaker 5:          00:27:26       His story differs from the government versus he said it would be like if it was really weird, his beard was completely black. When they came in and like there was no gray hairs and stuff. Like would he be really just for meaning his beard? Well, he might, Brendan Walsh does. I think it looks sexy as fuck on Brendan. I would say I would support it. And why not do you don't do it? Who Cares? You know? Uh, but, uh, I don't, who cares? I don't care if they, I don't think, you know, the whole reason why, oh, that guy existed is because we do it the only way a guy like, uh, Osama bin Ladin or any of these radical guys ever exists is there's gotta be some great empire to oppose and it's not a great empire of altruism is trying to help people all over the world and trying to enhance the lives of people and, and clean up their areas and make money in, in, in helping countries instead of making money and just robbing their resources and then taking out their military, taking out their collapse, it will collapse.

Speaker 5:          00:28:27       That's the problem. We don't have to have an empire. See, that's the problem. They're all empires do collapse because they're run by cons. You can't run an empire, not be a con. Well, we not, we need is civilization. We don't need an empire anymore. All these, these, these organizations, they're not, they're not necessary. What we need to figure out is how natural resources can be distributed equally to all nations. And that sounds fucked up. But that's reality is otherwise everyone's just going to go where the resources are and they're going to argue about this a lot. I mean, I think, I'd like to believe that that's the case, that we could have a free society of a fairer society. But, um, I think Brian, you believe that like human nature just, it's never going to happen, right? I mean, I have a lot of thoughts about human nature.

Speaker 5:          00:29:12       I think humans are inherently lazy. And if we had like a socialist system, a lot of people wouldn't do anything. So I think capitalism doesn't motivate people to a certain extent. Of course it can go a little too far. Certainly Kenton's corporation start acting in their own interest and they become really big and it certainly is a great motivating factor. I believe you should be rewarded for your efforts. I mean, I believe that in many of the ideas that go behind capitalism, where I think we fuck up is with shit like the stock market, things that can be manipulated where you can on. I got to talk to you about derivatives. I got to drop some time attempts. You all right. So, um, I actually spent some time in Boston. I spent four years at Mit, I think around the same time you were there.

Speaker 5:          00:29:50       Oh, I don't know if I will. I don't want too many comedy clubs when I was there and was fucking awesome town if it wasn't so cold. Especially Cambridge. What a great place. Right across from the necco wafer factory on two. So three masses. So you'd worked in, do you understand the riveter? Which I got a mechanical engineering degree, but I went straight to Wall Street afterwards and worked in banking. And then for the last 10 years I worked in London and the credit derivative industry, but worst of all derivatives. So what is it? It's your gambling. Ghanaians and driven as I was. I was thinking about how I could talk about this and I hear you talk about it all the time. So I figure I must be frustrating. Like this room [inaudible] I have friends that'll talk about Jujitsu, you know like coy hoists.

Speaker 5:          00:30:29       Gracie, when he'd do just grab them, we're just reach over and grab the neck. I'm like no, he did it. And it could be worse. It could have friends. You can have friends that took about comfort ride, right? Oh No, I had a guy, this is the worst shot out I could ever give anyone. But he said to me when he popped up with a chat when he was like tried to talk to Joe about cooking food cause I think yes, some negative ideas and I was like, look dude, I don't really believe in [inaudible] through myself, so it's going to be tough for me to convince him. We just, you know, it's not that Kung Fu doesn't work, it's just, it's definitely not the best way to go. It's that simple. There's a lot of stuff that works, you know, if you back for someone in the face, I mean it, it, it's not going to feel good.

Speaker 5:          00:31:05       It's not gonna feel good to get back fist in the face, but it's not as good as you fucking overhand, right. Somebody, it's just not qualifiers. It's, it's not that it doesn't work, it's just, it doesn't work on the right people. You know, you can probably knock out an 86 year old grandmother with the white crane dancing tiger technique, but tried on an MMA fighter. It's not going to happen. Well, it's also the way they practice it a lot, the way a lot of people are practicing it. I'm like, oh my God. Like you're, you're, you're, you're being silly. It's like you're strong, a punch and then you're pretending that if you threw that punch, what I would do is that what you step right here and then I would attack your organs like this with a claw motion. We would, come on, we just had, I'm Roger, could I do that?

Speaker 5:          00:31:42       That guy's got a punch you again and again and again. He's going to kick you in the Dick. It's going to be a lot of shit happening. You're not gonna have time to get off that claw claw to the liver. We just had Roger Gracie in the studio on Friday and he was talking about, we were rubbishing off Kung Fu and karate, something bad. We're going to get some hate. But he was talking about the Kata and have you get good at the cocktail. You get your belt. And he was like, but in Jujitsu you spa and you haven't test, you can put a choke on someone, but what about if he doesn't want you to put it on? And he just was kind of breaking down some of the core differences. Yeah, there's a big difference. I have a black belt in taekwondo as well in taekwondo.

Speaker 5:          00:32:14       There was guys that were black belts that weren't that good. They just weren't that good. They had been around a long time. They'd take their forms and they, they did okay and sparring, but the reality is they weren't really black belts. They'd never reached that expert level. Like they could get mugged. Someone can kick their ass like they really weren't adept at fighting. Do you know what I find is very interesting Joe, which you might appreciate these. If you look at some of those more ridiculous martial arts. Um, you see a guy like 45 or 55, you see digital guy at that age, he stopped, he still rolls. He's like he's in shape, you know, but you see one of these guys and without fail, every single 45 year old plus traditional martial artist is the guy who's got like a slouch and a beer belly and you can see he hasn't done a pushup for like 15 years.

Speaker 5:          00:32:57       You know what I mean? Yeah. Those like Uci Rue guys and the weirdest thing poisons. They want to be called by some weird title as well. You said it was in the face. He pulled up like some weapons on Facebook. There are any tall guy with a backpack and you're like, look at his face. It's not a Jujitsu black cause he didn't have the lines on his face like all those hard because he doesn't take himself. He just hides behind, like he gets his belt where it gets a certificate and he says, okay, that's me. I'm this grand master. And then all the little students bow to him because I think he's got mystical powers, but at the end of the day he's not progressing. He's not progressing in his art and just makes my blood boil man. For those who don't know what nick is, her Jujitsu black belt.

Speaker 5:          00:33:33       Yeah, there's, that's what Jujitsu is all about, exposing reality and there's a lot of martial arts that are about putting on a show. It's really kind of completely contrary to Jujitsu. It's why in taekwondo had a big impact on me as a child because in doing something that was difficult in taekwondo, it was like the first character forming thing that I did as as a person. But there's a lot of cult aspects to it. You know, the bowing and the calling, the, you know, the instructor sir, and always bowing to them. They were just like this. None of that shit's in Jujitsu. The respect is all like real, legitimate, natural, friendly respect. Like John John Machado. I have a black president and John Jack as well. And John Jack is, he's not just like a great Jujitsu coach. He's like everyone's friend. He's like a really nice guy. So he's very informal, but it's no one ever like disrespects him or no one ever takes advantage of that, that friendliness and thinks that you know, that they would be a better fighter than him or they can kick his ass sparring or something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:34:40       Yeah. But karate guys will always have to put on not, and I don't want, I don't want to say always because a lot of, um, it's just, uh, it's, it's done correctly and it is a discipline and it's all about, you know, maintaining, you know, the, the, the, the, the sort of, uh, the, the, the mindset of the Zen martial arts practitioner. There's a lot of people that are legit about it, but there's also a lot of people that they just want to put up a fucking dog and pony show so that you don't challenge them and test them and then they develop a fucking job. I got a great story for you. We'll get back to derivatives. Don't worry, I'll leave it at that. So when I first started grappling and Cape Town, it was right before the, just off the first year I've seen it was just starting to be understood about functional martial arts. And um, if you're the guys at the club where I trained, they were, they were going around, they just wanted to learn. So they going to every martial arts club they could go, they could find and just just testing the instructor and seeing what they could learn from him. That's what they get to Ninjitsu

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       school. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:35:40       is that, by the way, what is Ninja too? It's what I want him to learn. When I was a kid and I looked at martial arts magazines, I was trying to pick out martial arts to learn before I practice anything. I was like, it'd be pretty good to be an engine. I just alcohol. But I needed something where you could get a black belt. That's one of the reasons I wanted karate first. I wanted to get a black buddy. Get it. You don't even know who's the best ones and they all dress the same I need about Matt.

Speaker 6:          00:36:02       So, um, so they get to this Ninjitsu school and they say to the guy, you know, we'd, we'd, um, we'd like to spar with, you'd like to see your system and what you can do. So you said you will wait until after the class. And so they were like, okay. They stuck around and watch them walk on their hands, whatever it is you do and you do to class. And then at the end of the class, the instructor said, he said, students, we have a challenge. And what he did is he took out a blind fold. You Walk to the center of the Mat and he knelt down, crossed his arm, we'll put the blindfold on Christ his arms and then said to them, my buddy, he said, attack me. I sweat. I couldn't make this up

Speaker 5:          00:36:40       again though.

Speaker 6:          00:36:46       For my buddy looked around the room looking for a camera. He was like, this has gotta be like some kind of joke. And then he just kind of ran rod to the back of him and put on a rear naked choke and this guy like squealed and didn't know what was going on and eventually like the guy let him go. And that was, that was the end of Ninjitsu for our training.

Speaker 5:          00:37:01       Yes. Well it was really nice about it cause he could have just punted him in the face. It's nice that he had kick fucking shogun style 2004 no it's dead. He decided to choke him and that's a very nice guy cause he couldn't just run up and just need the fuck out of his face. Or what was your modem right? Yeah he's silly. Mitch what do you do at attack me? Oh my God, you're crazy. There's a lot of dudes who got mad at me online. A lot of these black dudes that do Kung Fu in New York cause there's like a whole culture like from the warriors that kind of there. But those guys fit. Most of it's fake Kung Fu. When I say fake Kung Fu, it's like a lot of their doing. They're making shit up. Like, what if you did like this? Oh man, you can't do like that.

Speaker 5:          00:37:43       Look at how much you've got exposed like this area. I'm attacking your knee here silent like you got, you got problems here. I've got a tiger cloth to the side of your neck. Your whole side of your neck is wide open. Like they talk to them completely. I like watching. I laughed my ass off at him. Look, these guys want to believe that they're real martial artists and they're really mad at me like, and the guy was like, come on son. You tell me if I hit you in the facial, the monkey pod, they wouldn't hurt. Yeah, yeah. If you, if I let you hit me in the face of the monkey part would probably be hurt. But the crazy, that's not what I'm saying here. What I'm saying is you're, you're practicing some nonsense kid. All right.

Speaker 6:          00:38:18       But we all have aspects of our life in which we're deluding ourselves. You know what I mean? Just probably kind of identify them like, oh, for them it's martial arts. For us. It may be you, I don't know, relationships or whatever.

Speaker 5:          00:38:27       Yeah. People love to dilute themselves. It's way easier than facing the insignificance of your reality in this crazy picture of the whole unit. It's a mechanism for

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       the brain. The ego's therefore to give you a reason to stay alive until you can get enlightened enough that you no longer need the ego to appreciate this existence, but the ego is there to keep you alive. You're super special when you're a fucking a 10 year old, you know your ego sense. That makes so much sense. It's just a, it's an engine to push you forward and then from there it's all about getting enlightened to the point. We no longer need the ego, the ego to enjoy the existence, but that doesn't happen in the way that joy does. So you just, you can do it. I did it. I mean, I'm not perfect, but I'm, I'm, I'm certainly way more evolved than I was when I was a younger person, but what was that? Through training or through psychedelics or both? All of the above.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       Jujitsu for sure. Helped Jujitsu, how I'm been doing Jujitsu since [inaudible] 96 and I think just getting constantly fucking strangled and going at it until your heart's going to explode in your chest and you're trying not to tap. But you know, you got to realize you've got to tap and then you've got to go again because there's still four minutes left in the round and you're fucking, you know, you're going out and you develop these intense relationships with people because you understand their character. You know, you see dudes that break, you see dudes that will never break. You know, guys that are so tough to tap and the, and you know guys who are above monster out of the gate but then they run out of gas. You know, that's me.

Speaker 6:          00:39:51       No, that's even one level up. It's like I'm in Jiu Jitsu instructor and then, um, I dunno if all digits instructors have it. I'd love to hear some from some of the others. But you know when all your students are watching and it's like that young tough 20 year old kid and he's the top purple belt and you're like, and you're tired and you've got to carrying an injury or something, you know, you got to put it on the line of these buckets aren't going to respect you anymore. It's true. It's difficult.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Have An, you know what the reality is, there's a lot of instructors out there with Marcello Garcia comes to their school, they're going to get tapped so they have to, they have to figure out what to do here. Do I just let everybody know? Yeah, Marcella can tap me and this is how watch me get treated like a baby. You know? I mean, a lot of people have a real issue with that and then there's a lot of dudes that say, you know, okay, now I'm an instructor. Like I have to make sure I'm lifting weights. You know, I have to, I have to be bigger and stronger. Like Eddie Bravo talks about that. Like, he's, he fights for his life when he's in, in those classes because Eddie's at such a high level right now, especially his guard. His guard is fucking so nasty. I rolled with a lot of dudes, but he's one of the few guys, him and Danny, then one of the few guys that consistently catch me from their guard and the, that's how fucking hard to catch someone from the chairman. I got a role with you. Yeah, seriously do. Maybe Thursday, Thursday. Cool. Um, but uh, yeah, come to 10th planet. I loved how you guys. Um, I think that, uh, when you, when you do that on a regular basis and you tap, you tap people, you get tapped you to strain. Yuh Yuh Yuh Yuh Yuh Yuh blow through all the energy that you have in, in a, in a, in an endeavor, especially one that's so primal. Jujutsu so life, death, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       even though you can do it and no one gets hurt, it's the craziest thing, man. You don't have this, this theory, that Jitsu. Um, I reckon you would know more about someone after a 10 minute Jujitsu match than a 10 minute conversation, 10 hour conversation character be 10 fucking years. You know, there's certain dudes where you tap them once and then they're done. You own them. You could just run right through them. Even if they're not tired, they just start giving stuff up. You know, you see it, you see like, and you're like, come on man, pull your arm back. You know, put your arm, Tuck yourself, you've got to protect yourself is get that leg, that leg and you'll start walking through it. You don't want them to break. You want them to like to build up and you know, you want them to like offer legitimate resistance.

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       And that's what sparring supposed to be about. That happened to me in Brazil. I went down as a white belt and I was training Gracie Baha and like all week I was getting my ass tapped out as a white belt and then Friday was no gay day and I showed up obviously with no bell. And I started rolling with this one dude and I tapped him like six times and I think he just didn't know who I was. And after that first time, after that first happy it was over. Yeah, it can happen. And then there's dudes are like, I remember this guy man, this guy just started doing Jujitsu. He was as crazy Armenian dude. I mean he had just started, he was just learning techniques and he would spar with anybody and this fucking guy just would not tap. He would fight to the death and watching him roll with people.

Speaker 5:          00:42:56       I'm like, check this motherfucker out. Like you would think he was done and he would just die. I just fucking struggling flat. And he wasn't strong and he wasn't big. He was just fucking proud. It's shit and bound and determined not to tap. Not necessarily the best way to go about it. And he had to get over that. You gave us some respect. I'll fuck. Yeah. Well I remember watching him because it was one of his first classes and you know, it's really, it's fascinating to me. Fascinating to me watching people just start Jujitsu. You know, the, the Jujitsu digital guys were the modern day jet I nights. Yeah. You know, like Hixon would be like the Yoda equivalent. Do you know what I mean? It's like, it's, it's kind of cool when you think about it that way. We have people who take ourselves to the limit.

Speaker 5:          00:43:40       Do you know what I mean? And that's why there's such a comradery between Digi two guys. You know what I mean? Like you know so much about it. You do to guy when you shake his hand. Yeah. Yeah. I think, um, I think you have to ha, I always talk about how well like Jujitsu guys have control of their ego and it's like, it was very rare you run into Jujutsu guys completely out of control. So many of our early guests were actually Jujitsu guys cause it was who we knew for London real. And I'm like, it must have had eight of them and the guys and they were all just these cool, grounded, pretty humble. Dude's still smart, still excelling in their field, but they were just, I don't know how they get their checked on a regular basis. That's what it is, man. It's getting checked on a regular basis. It's, it's huge. It's so important. It's what I said about the ego, your ego. It leads you to victory. It leads you to, to want the glory and the accolades, but ultimately a fucks you. If you fight with your ego, everybody knows

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that you know you'll, you'll lose your composure, you'll get crazy. Especially if you start getting tagged, you'll instead of fighting smart, you'll just fucking flail back. You'll try to attack back, which is oftentimes the total wrong approach. Like you have to do the right thing technically, so you have to, if you, if you're going to do the right thing, technically you have to be in complete control. Your Ego, you can't even let that factor into the process. Look at it as a game.

Speaker 6:          00:44:55       You can sense that. I mean his presence, he is, we interviewed him on our show the other day and one of the things I brought up was I've known him for almost 10 years and Joe, I swear to God, I've never seen him lose his cool. He is the most zen person on the planet or the one Muslim person I know. And um, it goes hand in hand with good Jujitsu. Like I noticed the calmer I'm getting as a human being, maybe it's good to the aging of meditation, the better my Jiu Jitsu is, the more I'm in touch with reality when I'm like sparring with someone. And uh, I find that interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       I do as well. I think Jujitsu is an excellent part of daily life for a man especially. And I think it's just one aspect. The other is our nutrition philosophy, thought conversation, conversation with others. You know, I know this, this podcast for sure. You know, people talk about how much this podcast has helped them. What's helped me too because it's helped me really review a lot of the ideas that I have in my head and my, my take on things. And, and really, uh, in, in, in projecting it out to other people and or broadcasting it out to people. You, you also are forced to sort of take a real account of all your thoughts and it's sort of like teaching Jujitsu, which your game better. He learned by teaching. If you teach Jujitsu, man, you're going to empathize, right? Yeah. My friend Brent, perfect example was always like a decent purple belt. Always a, you know, but he, he wasn't like the best guy and man, he started fucking teaching, he's a black belt now but he started teaching and when he was teaching within a year, his game went up so many notches. Like all of a sudden he was dangerous as fung. All of a sudden every time you rolled with them he was snatching Camorra's you're like, oh, this is like he's doing this perfect like we had the tech is technique became so sharp.

Speaker 6:          00:46:39       Do you know why that is? I actually find out the other day because I noticed that as well when I started teaching full time. I've got, I've got quite a lot better and we have, I don't know if I'm using the correct term, but this specific kind of neuron in our brain that fires when we see someone doing something, it's, I think it's called an empathy neuron. And so when you're a teacher, you watch your students in a, I don't know about your process when you teach them a bit. For me, I watch what they do and I kind of, in my mind I overlay what it should look like. There's like a mental video overlay and then eventually I'll show them what to do and they'll do it correctly. And it's kind of like me doing the technique again. Does that make sense? Yes. So, um, I guess that's what's happening when you watch someone else doing something or if you just involved in the process, that's where you can get better watching fight video's.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       Absolutely. Yeah. And having knowledge of what to do already in your head, like having especially patterns. Like the other day I was in, I,

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       I had this guy in side control and he tried to get up to one knee and as he tried to get up to one knee, I took us back and it was all in one second. The whole thing was like, you know it all just like, you know, it happens. Like you, you, you couldn't think if even if you were like an athletic person, you wouldn't be able to do it like that because you know what, what's happening is your mind is being bypassed. Your Buddy, my parents first coach always said to me, he used to say, your body knows what to do but your mind gets in the way. And that's when that happens for me is the most beautiful. So crazy. Cause it happens and it's really is like magic. It's like all the sudden you got this dude's back. Gosh, you know, it's like, and, and, and especially if you freak a guy out, like he's like, Holy Shit, I just got to get my back like that.

Speaker 5:          00:48:14       Like Marcello's my favorite example of that, when you watch like Marcels arm drag to back, there's a moment where these guys can't even believe this motherfucker got their back so quick. Like how did he do that? You know, my buddy, my friend Alexis, um, he's a high level black ball now. This is one of those guys a little bit, a little bit skinny, you know like so, but he's reasonably his leg but he's not like an Olympian, you know, so he's, he's quite a fragile guys light. It's like 150, hundred and 60 pounds and he, he's so God damn technical like he is literary like, like a surgeon wielding the scalpel. And he told me he went to train with Marcello and he said, he said to me, nick, I swear to God it felt like that man was reading my mind. Every move I did.

Speaker 5:          00:48:59       He knew if I went to put my hand down to get my balance, cause it off balance me, he had grabbed my hand and then he had no, I'd reached to counter with the other hand and he'd read, have already have something queued up. She said it was like reading my mind. He robbing him. Yeah. No, I've never rolled with him. So I mean, just think like for a high level blackball to say that about my solo. Isn't that exciting? We can all one day get perhaps close to that level. Yeah. The best guys I wrote with John Jacques Machado, a role with him pretty regularly. I've rolled with Eddie Bravo a bunch of times of course. And uh, he's, which, and Denny Denny proper goals was one of Eddie's black belts. He's got a nasty guard and he's on small dude. He's only about 160 pounds and he's still, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:49:37       And he's still contact me from the guard regularly. He's wicked. Yeah, there's a lot. He's got a, Eddie's got a lot of guys that just have stupid guards should get keys and other ones. This dude. And he's, you know, 135 pounds. What do you enjoy? You like her card or a pastor or what's your style? I've changed much more over the years and tried to be much more guard oriented and half guard oriented and earn, earn top position. You know, because I, most of my game, most of my submissions were from the top and I realize that's unrealistic. Maricio um, I mean, he's a seventh, he's a red and a red and white, red and black belt. So I mean this guy is legit. And he said to me, I said, when I was up quite a bit younger, I said like, man, you know, Merito I thought about it like I don't want to play on my back because if I'm on my backup, just trying to get to the top anyway, so why don't I just go straight to top?

Speaker 5:          00:50:29       And he said, you know, Nick, when you get older you'll see you'll need your God, you'll need it. Cause it's, there's much more energy conservation when you're on your back. And, um, I didn't think about it, but all I get, you know, I kind of see that, I know what he was talking about. I like to earn it, you know, that's what Eddie, he says if you're going to attack someone from the top, you should earn that position. So I always start off from guard a 10th planet. Well I've been injured, I've been injured for five months. I fucked my backup. And what I tried to do was I tried to just like a lightly role and he's like an asshole. Even though I knew it was injured, I was like, I just like roll with like guys, no, go hard. And then I fucked it up way worse.

Speaker 5:          00:51:07       And the one day where I tried to look rolled light set me back three months. Then I came back and I only trained for a couple of days and I popped it out again. But it was much more mild this time. It was, it just a bad muscle tear and a, it's in my back. It's where a year like in between your shoulder blades, like that's where I tore the muscle is just really weird. It was a Jujitsu thing. Are you gonna be rolling to, you're like 65 do you think? Or later you'd be like Helio Gracie till the wheels fall off rolling until the wheels fall off. I mean, I've got to say it was nice during the five months that I was off where I didn't, I was, it wasn't always tweaked. It was always like my elbow, like I should have tapped from that and I muscled out of it or my neck got tweaked or it's always something I don't know about you.

Speaker 5:          00:51:52       But um, for me, and I'm sure from a few other GC guys, you know, when you, when you get to the end of a hard week of training and you're just fucked, everything hurts. And you've got that like bone tiredness. Yeah, yeah. I used to like fight against it, but now I kind of get off on that. Do you know what I mean? I feel like in my body I'm alive. Do you know what I'm saying? Well, you also feel like you've, you've earned relaxation. You've actually done something incredibly difficult. Like I had a great role last night and, uh, I came home, this is my third time back from the injury and I'm like, I'm finally like pretty sure that it's, it's, if it's not 100%, it's definitely 90%. So I'm feeling great and it was just fucking exhausted and I just plopped down on the couch and watch TV, but I didn't feel guilty at all about watching TV.

Speaker 5:          00:52:34       You know, it's like I did something pretty fucking, I put forth some serious effort and I don't feel like I can enjoy like bullshit, like fucking off, like watching TV or something, unless I've done something hard. I feel like you should reward yourself with bullshit like, but it's all a matter of managing it. You know? It's like, I like to, I like to watch TV or watch a movie after I've written for a few hours, you know, or I just like, okay, I did my work. I can just shut off now, man, I can't do it. Joe, you know, just telling Brian the other day I sold my playstation in my TV. I just, I realized I don't want it in my house anymore man because you know, it sounds a bit strange but I always feel kind of empty after watching TV or, and it's not porn, um, or playing video games. I don't feel like I've grown as a person. I feel like it was just like, like a vegetable, you know? And I'm happy to have it at the house while there's a very different feeling that get from playing video

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       games than I get from doing other things that are difficult. Like pool, I played pool, which is also a lot of people would say is a waste of time. You know? Like they always say that if someone is good at pool, it's a glorious results of a misspent youth. You know, that's what you did. That's what people describe like a really good pool player. But I feel that pool in a lot of ways is a lot like Jujitsu cause it's a lot, a lot about managing your nerves. It's a lot about control of your body. It's a lot about concentration. It's not as fast paced, but it's, it's pretty intense when you play high level pool. And so to me it's not just a game, it's also, there's a lot of exercise going on there. There's a lot of exercise of control and composure and then you know, in striking the ball in judging how hard to hit it, you'll, you'll literally are judging how much energy you release, your like controlling the effort. And it's very important because you can't hit everything full blast. It's not like, you know, boxing, we, he tried to knock somebody out in the first round. You could just get away with all power punches. You have to have a real good sense of how likely or how hard you need to hit that ball and you need to be able to control that ball with the levels level sticks. So you need to figure out how to drive through it level. As you're coming down. There's a lot of thinking and weirdness going on.

Speaker 6:          00:54:40       If you look at it like if I'm from a big, big picture perspective, there's some philosophy Alan Watts. And he says, yeah, I think he was around in the 60s, the 70s. And he was saying how, um, you'll get these wealthy people who they'll buy a huge boat and then they wonder why it doesn't make them happy. And it's because pleasure comes from the acquisition, the process of acquiring a skill. It doesn't come from like a material object. And um, that made a lot of sense to me. You know, that's why like when you go and you'd get on the mat, like now I find digits is the most fun now that I'm a black belt because I've acquired that skill and I can just enjoy it. I'm not, I'm not trying too hard to get better. I'm just enjoying my skill and getting pleasure from it. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:19       Yeah. Like, you know, when you, when you have a good role, like say you get in there with a good purple belt or something like that, someone was real scrappy and you'd go and you're countering each other and you attack and counter each other and then you finally know, catch a dude with something and it's like, man, you earn that shit. You know, it's a, this, there's something beautiful about pulling off a technique on an unwilling participant. You know, when you've, you've figured out a way to bypass his defenses and you get in and, and it's a fascinating game of intellect and that's what people don't understand. It's not just a physical thing. There's certainly physical aspects to it. Especially I feel them now because I'm just getting back into Jujitsu shape. Cause even if you work out, it's not the same. The only thing that comes closest kettlebells, there's especially a kettlebell workout called extreme kettlebell cardio workout. It's company called dragon door sells it. And this, this motherfucker puts you through hell. I mean, it's a light light kettlebell too. He does it with a 35 pound kettle bell. And I would've never believed that someone could give me a good workout with a little pussy ass 35 pound weigh in my bitch. Like where's the 70s son? Let me show you what the fuck is up. But if I'm sure, how long was

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       it? God, it's 20 minutes. 45 minutes man. And by the end of 45 minutes, 45 minutes with like a minute break here and there in between sets it's Ruth, the less it's ruthless, your fucking legs want to die. It's like they're going to break. You feel like you're going to step and your muscle is just going to fall off your leg. Like you've, you've ripped it all apart. If you get through that 45 minutes without Kettlebell, congratulations. You're a beast. Yeah. Brian's a big show coming up. Well before I ask a trip, like Brian's like I gotta do my Kettlebell workout in the morning because it puts you in a good mood and tried to get in the right zone. It puts those endorphins going, man. It, it fires up your system, you know, gets your testosterone production up that when you're doing like re like they always say that the best exercises for putting on mass or a full body exercises like dead lifts traditionally squats, things along those lines where your whole body has to move as a unit far more effective for putting on like real size and functional strength and like say just bench press or just curls or something along those, you know, if you look at someone who is primary supplemental training outside, did you too is um, bodybuilding.

Speaker 5:          00:57:28       You can see they just don't move, right? It's not the way the human body was designed to move through space. You know that like they're all luck through the chest and shoulders and there's no like horizontal movement in their hips. There's only linear movement. Cause if you think about you're pushing like 400 pounds on a leg press, it's a very, your muscles and your tendons, your ligaments and your bones get used to working in a very specific direction. There's no like balance and a, and flexibility in it. So I got a question about Aubrey when he's on here and talking about all his crazy, like he boga I remember you and Brian were listening to him talking about Yoga and you're like, I don't ever want to do stuff like that. And when he talks about Iowasca is that stuff that you guys just are like, never, I never want to touch that stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:58:05       Oh, do, I'll ask in a heartbeat. I'm not worried about Iowasca I'm again seems, uh, I think it would be great for someone who had real serious personality issues, substance addiction, substance abuse issues. I don't have those. So I am, Hancock was talking about the boat and he's like, I don't want to do it again. The closest I have to a substance abuse issue is coffee. I love coffee. It's a powerful, you're IOWASCA coffee. Oh. Oh. Will ask it at somebody's died the other day from the supposedly, yeah, but they don't know if the IOWASCA killed him. Pete. Yeah. Some of the showman could have killed them. The sham cause the showman buried him. So who knows if he died during a ceremony or you know, he might've been an asshole, somebody about to kill them. You really legit. Sharman like, like an old school. Yeah. He was in some movie before that and like, yeah. And like a legit movie. And then apparently this kid's dead. So it's writing that drag off. Now. One guy dies me while he smoked cigarettes. Hilarious cigarettes kill 500,000 people a year in this country alone. And he's like, well, it's fucking Iowasca killed one asshole in Peru. Iowasca the drug that he said, it makes you feel like you're dying in the home. Have. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck that drug. I think we both said fuck

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       that drug. I think, I think it's very beneficial for certain people. I, I have a friend, my friend Ed who runs a center down in Mexico, um, uh, ed class, one of the Lloyd Irvin's black belts, um, great guy. And he's, um, he's, his whole life changed because of Ibogaine. He took it and went down and he had an issue with pain pills. He had got an injury. And like a lot of guys that get injured and the doctor prescribing something, especially if you fuck up your back. It happened to someone I know very, very well. It was a construction worker hurt his back. Strong opiate, isn't it? It's terrifying. It's very terrifying that it's so readily available that doctors will prescribe it so easily and that they're trusting you to have control that giving you all these pills all at once. It's not like you go to the doctor and every day he dispenses you a new one and it says, listen, I'll give you, you want to get on Oxycontin, I will give it to you, but you got to come to me.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       I give you one. No, he used a whole bottle of 90 fucking pills. If you want to take four at a time, you can take four at a time. No one's going to stop you. So it's weird that we're in London. We don't have that readily accessible opiate prescriptions. We have an incredibly hypocritical society, especially in Florida, Florida. They would have done documentaries on it. Um, that show 'em the vanguard had the, uh, the oxycontin express. It was a show dedicated just to oxycontin where they showed that Florida, they have these ridiculous laws where you, I think they're trying to change that now probably because of vanguard probably because of that oxycontin express show, but they have these things called pain management centers. So say you come in and you say, Hey, uh, you know, I hurt my back and uh, really it's fucking painful.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       I can't even sleep. And like, okay, well I'm going write you a prescription for pain pills. And then you take it and you shut that door and you open the next door, the same building. They're connected and that's the pharmacy and they have your pain pills and it's all they have is that continue to exist because there's corruption. And by the way, Florida is also the state that has recently come under fire for hiring police officers to pretend to be high school students, to get kids to sell him pot. They hired a 25 year old woman who was hot. She was attractive to make friends with a 17 year old boy who was an honor roll student. This kid tested negative, by the way, does it didn't have any pot in his system, didn't do drugs, didn't have a, didn't have a record smug kit.

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       Just a kid. Yeah, just a kid. And she made friends with them and then got him to sell her weed and then they had, they had him arrested and she coerced him. I mean she's 25 years old. She's a woman. Okay. And she's dealing with a boy and she's attractive. First of all, that's completely unfair. The attractive woman have a massive amount of power. [inaudible] oh boy. Ashley, over 17 years, especially in attractive, attractive 25 year old woman. I mean that's a real woman and he smells that when a boy would smell that and the affection for that woman would be like super special. So you know what's funny is sickness. But when I was younger, like my fantasy

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       was an older woman. Then the older you get it kind of switches around that are all, as you get older and younger fantasies. Younger woman threw him for a loop and he was like, oh, I just didn't know if you were done. I thought you were going to keep going. Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. It's, that's a weird thing. But some dudes know there's like the whole MILF market and porn. So goods are into like this really dirty look and 40 year olds just fucking savage, just cock monsters as four year old fucking with Mascara of sweat nude, all that.

Speaker 5:          01:02:53       A lot of those videos dudes are into that now. It's women who just want to get gorilla fucked. Older women are just, they know what they want. That's like a whole market dirty milk. What's pretty you pretty freaky mocket as well. What's this movie called? Samsara recently. The SQL to Berakah and um, you know it says a bunch of long shots with no dialogue and they showed this. It was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. The sex doll factory and then they juxtapose that shot with one of those strip clubs slash brothels in Thailand and to make a point. And it, it showed you just how similar the whole thing is the sex industry. I mean, do you know what I mean? Selling sex dolls and selling human beings is pretty much the same, the same thing. And in that case, that's, that's fascinating to are you guys, you guys move into Wester?

Speaker 5:          01:03:39       No, it was talking about here too. And you always talk about like what you want to do with that squad and with the podcast and I'm like, well, you know, I think you said recently you would like feel a responsibility to kind of like take this to another level and stuff. I'm just wondering what you meant by that. Well, um, the, the only thing we're doing differently is one, I have a new studio that I'm opening up. It's closer to where I live. Um, and it's a completely independent thing. It's not connected to a comedy club and it's got a lot of space. So the idea is that we can have it set up the way I would like to have it set up where, you know, have a nice cameras and monitors on the wall. But you're not getting rid of red band, right?

Speaker 5:          01:04:15       No. I've had this motherfucker with me for 10 years. I'm not going anywhere. He's Brian's one of my best friends. I mean, he's not just a, and he's a weird motherfucker, but you don't, you don't get some weird dude. He's into Hitler cats. That's just, that's, it's hard to find. Hard to find. So he's an important element. So he's going to be placed where like people hang out or is it going to get studio? Oh, Brian's going to be with me this weekend, by the way. Um, we're going to be in Phoenix at stand up alive and it's going to be fucking crazy. Folks. Uh, Joey Diaz is there a, he won't be there on Sunday, but he's there Friday and Saturday. Um, and Ari Shaffir is going to be there on Friday. Brendan Walsh going to be in on Saturday. Brian's going to be there the whole week. We're going to have a fucking blast. But we haven't been a Phoenix. Uh, it's been a couple of years. One of my favorite places like that in Texas. It's a cool town. Did you hear they bought the other bus? Yeah, they bought the Tempe Improv too. Good for them. You still get nervous? I get excited, right? Yeah. Not Nervous. I'm looking forward to doing it. I just, it's a, it's important. So I get excited. I wouldn't say nervous with that

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       implies like fear. It's not a fear thing. It's like, it's an excitement. Like, uh, you have to be heightened. You definitely, you can't like go up nonchalant. Me People want to be entertained. They want to be it. They want it to feel the intensity of the performance. They want to feel the focus. They want to be entertained, so you have to be up for it. So it's an exciting thing. It's not a nerve. But if I didn't do my job though, I would feel fucking nervous. Like if I haven't been writing, I don't know what to say. And, uh, you know, there's, there's, there's a weird fear that comes with trying new shit and fucking around with new bits, especially if not convinced. Like sometimes I'll have a bit and uh, I'll start out with it and I'm like, man, this bit is this my fucking suck, this pit my suck.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       This might have been just one of those stone ramblings. And then I'll do it on stage and I'll find a path and all of a sudden it becomes a monster. It's like onstage, it'll become alive and the have to take that chance. Sometimes there's two aspects to writing. One aspect is the physical act of sitting in front of a keyboard, writing in silence by myself. There's that for sure. That's a very important aspect of it. But the other aspect of it is telling the story in front of people, telling the bit in front of people because then the motherfucker just comes alive then. Then I know like I was going to say it a certain way, but in the moment I got another one. I don't need that part. I need to edit that part out and just get right to this part. Boom, boom.

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       And it's a matter of editing on stage. It's one of the few art forms that you must have an audience to create. You have to, I cannot create, I can, sorry, I can start the process on my own, but I can't create the audience without any audience. We'll do any, oh well, I mean hopefully a good one. But, um, I can't create the standup. I can't, it can't become its full form without the crown. It's impossible. I used their energy. That's part of the equation, right? Yeah. It's a part of the reaction is part of it. The feel I get from him, the intangibles, like as I'm saying it, the, where I know the timing lies and it's, it's so, it would be impossible to describe such a specialized skill. It's a weird skill. It's a, it's, it's, it's see, cause it's not, it's not what everybody thinks it is, man.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       It's not just your, you know, you're saying things and people are considering what you're saying and they're laughing. Ha Ha. There's a little bit of that. But there's also some weird fucking connection, some hypnosis thing that's going on between the audience. Yeah, and as an audience member, I feel it as well. Like when I watch someone who I think is really hilarious, like a, when I saw Stan hope recently or when I saw a Joey Diaz the other day, like when someone is really killing and you're locked into their bit, it's, there's a, there's, there's this weird sort of a connection and the you as a performer, you feel that and then when you're coming up with new shit, it's like you've, you'll feel where it goes and where, and they also feel when you're faking it and you feel when it's forced, you feel like all these deals and you know what they feel, you know what the audience feels.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       It's like you're conducting this here. It's really a pure art form. It's a fucking weird art form. It's typically a hard comedy course. And I did five minutes in London and so it was chippy. I mean I know a lot of people hate on comedy courses. I know Marin hates on comedy courses, but he shouldn't, you know, because it gets people in the door and it gets them out of their shell. Right? Yeah. If you don't know anything about standup, if you're not a standup comedian, you know what you, why not take a course to get you to force yourself on stage? You know the real problem with courses is a lot of them are run by the losers. That's the problem, but you need a funny guy to teach you or do you need the guy really to get you on stage and then so you can learn yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       You're not going to get real comedy advice from somebody who sucks. Yeah. I don't think it's okay. They can't do it. Yeah. There was a bunch of people that wrote books on comedy and they were like, you know, I remember as a young professional when I had just started getting paid to do gigs, people would just laugh at these books, but a horrible, the comic who actually wrote the book was, but what a book does do. Even though I agree with that in certain ways it does get you interested in the conversation. It does. Like you might like go to the bookstore and say how to be a standup comic man, I need a fucking find a book on how to be a comic. And then that book might be step one taking class might be stepped to 10 years from now. You might be Mark Marin, you know, you might be a Mark Marin, you know, you might be a real professional comedian.

Speaker 1:          01:09:28       It's just a matter of taking those steps. And so the good thing that a comedy class does is that allows you to fuck around and get on stage and see if this is something that you're actually interested in. And, and, and just think about the process of it. And by the way, when you're in a bad comedy class, listening to idiots tell you how to do, you might be like, this guy's an idiot and that might help your comedy. Like that might help you understand that there's a lot of people out there that do it terrible. Don't do what this guy's doing. Don't hack it up up there. Don't make it so obvious. Don't insult me as a person is watching, you know, like you might feel insulted and that actually might benefit you in an educational sort of a way. Just kind of been sucked every week in front of these people and we all bonded at the end cause like he's 12 strangers and it's like, if you can't make 12 random people in London laughed and most likely you're not going to make a comedy audience laugh.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       And we just got up there. I would just say, oh by the way, tomorrow night we have a show here. We have a show here at the, uh, at the ice house. Um, Joey Diaz and I were on the phone today. It's like, what are we doing tomorrow, dog? And I go, what do you want to do? Is we've got to do a fucking show. We've got to do a fucking show. We can't come in cold the Phoenix cause like, we're not coming in cold to Phoenix dog. We got to give these motherfuckers are Valerie's house a show. So I said, all right. All right, we're going to do a show, sell down. Is it like breathing for you guys? You guys got to be on stage, um, weekly. Well, Joey is, um, you know, Joey's a guy who, no matter what, Joey's always doing three, four sets a week.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       He's always hopping around doing it. He loves it. It's one of the reasons why he's so good, so comfortable and natural up there. And it's just also what he loves. He's a real stand up, you know, he's a, he's a black belt in standup comedy. He loves it. He loves it. It's the same thing. So for him it's like, he knows that we're going to have these huge crowds. It's Phoenix, the club is like 600 seats. So it's, it's, and it's almost sold out. So it's going to be nuts. Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday and one show on. So Joey's just fucking ramping up right now. He's fucking shadowbox. And in his house we invited him on London Real, but then he told us he doesn't have a passport, so can't go to London. Yeah, yeah. That sucks. That's too bad because a, that would be awesome to have him on.

Speaker 1:          01:11:26       It would, yeah. You guys could experience the love you. Um, can you tell is someone who's like, um, you're like a belt and some comedy as well. So can you tell when you meet your, when you meet a new colleague appeared, can you tell if they're a natural or if there's someone who had average talent and really polished it to a high degree, you could tell if they're a douchebag and if there a douchebag, they're probably not going to be that good. There's something I'm telling you it's going to be fake. They're going to be clunky. And then there's some people you meet and they're just so open. There's so like, and you're like, Whoa, I gotta see what this guy does on stage. You know what I mean? Like some people you meet them and they're, they're just really there and centered and engage in you and you're like, oh, this is a sharp motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       Like what's going on when he's talking to you? Yeah. You know? And then there's other guys that are like really quiet and then they get on stage and there a mother fucker. You know, you never know. It's, it's people's personalities or strange. There's some people that are completely different on stage and they are offstage. It's weird. You know, in some people they're really fucking funny on stage and then offstage they just, you know, kinda quiet, reserved, you know it's very strange. It's like they get it all out in their onstage antics. This, there's that too. There's a lot of different types of comedy. The most taxing and exhausting is the always on fucking one liner guy who's always trying to like say like the next funny thing. But you guys do crack jokes when you guys are hanging out. Yeah, but only the ones that work.

Speaker 1:          01:12:50       Okay. You've got to know what's your, it's the same thing we were talking about being a black belt. It's like you got to know what is actually funny and you've got to know what is just annoying to listen to. You know, what is just you jerking off into the wind and what is actually something that's relative, like something that relevant, something, something relevant to bring up. Something that you're actually contributing to the conversation. You, you took the term like one of the things that Brian's really good at, and I wanna encourage this, but I have to give him his props. He'll say some shit that I would have never fucking thought up and I would have never said. And he'll interject them in weird spots and it just like, it takes the conversation. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it takes it to a place that you probably would have never gone on your own.

Speaker 1:          01:13:35       And that's what's fun in having a conversation. What's fun and having a conversation. And what's fun in, in watching a standup comedian is someone who can take shit to places where you know, you might not have gone, but the relevant, they're relevant places. So it's like you allow them to think for you for a brief moment. You know, you allow that. And when someone, when they're, they're awkward and Clunky, you know, like you can't think for me stupid like, what are you doing here? You're bullshitting me. It's like, so when you say that someone's exhausting, cause they're always joke yucking it up. Like they don't understand how they're being perceived

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       there. There's a disconnect between what they're projecting and what they're imagining their projecting or how they're being received and what, how they're imagining their being received. There's a disconnect there and that that's a, that's just like the karate guy who still thinks he's a master and he's got a gut now, but he wants everybody to be terrified of him and he really does believe somewhere in the back of his head that he could fucking handle multiple attackers. You know, he's, he's bullshitting. That's the scariest thing in life is when you're confronted with, when your delusions are shown to, you know what I mean? Thank you. The Mac and then he'd just get the story and that's why I told you not to eat that cookie. This motherfucker was trying to give you have no cookies and you don't want to fuck with these edibles, man, edibles, edibles will put you in a bad place.

Speaker 5:          01:14:54       Miss you're ready foot. It's very confronting. You know? It's like, it just confronts you with all the weird shit that you've been pushed into the back of your head and it's like, I was Scott then. Well, have you ever seen the information on the difference between consuming marijuana? Can you talk about anyone? Other cannabinoids change on the first pass through the liver, right? Yeah. And the first pass through the liver becomes 11 hydroxy metabolite, which is this intense psychedelic drug, which is five times more psychoactive than THC. So for a portion of marijuana, like say what's in a pot brown, it just, if you smoked it would fucking get you high shit. But if you eat it like it's almost uncomfortable. It's like so self examine a Tory and so intensely, you know, probing to all aspects of your fears and an unconscious thoughts. That's why you do it on a plane.

Speaker 6:          01:15:47       You know what I was saying? I was in that I about five years ago and someone gave me a, Ronnie had never had one before and he picked me up in the morning. So this is for you. We want to wear to universal studios, which had never been to before. So I ate this thing on an empty stomach and um, I got really paranoid and I chicken out on the Shrek ride, man. Like I literally, I lost it. I said, I gotta get Outta here. There were all these mirrors on the walls wailing and quote Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. I'm scared of Shrek rise. That's a new meme now. That's a meme on the Rogan board. Brazilian Jujitsu. Black belt. Scared of Shrek, right? Yeah. Man

Speaker 5:          01:16:28       needs a motherfucker sign nothing. Nothing. There's a lot of people say it makes you paranoid. And I, I believe that a certain amount of paranoia is very important. I really think it's not paranoia. I think it's just sent me, how dare you. That ringtone? Yeah. Yeah. I don't change ringtones, bitch. I don't want to hear your music either. If you one of those dudes, it's got some fucking latest. Does Green Day have a latest song. They might have a bad ass ring too. They enjoy you sexy bitch. Um, both sex hand the fuck were we talking? I don't know, but I've got to drop some financial science on you. I had an appointment though. You've planned your ring tone. Oh, that's Kinda cool. If you get forgot that it certainly wasn't worth talking about. I was talking too much shit obviously.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       All right, so my job from long science here. Yeah, it sure. Can we have it of science? Yeah. I kind of look Trump a little bit. So I know you're always talking about the crazy derivatives and how there's too many amount there and it's betting on like fake stuff. Well, what I talk about is that I really, I'm a fucking idiot. I don't really understand it. So if I'm saying it, I'm just repeating some shit I heard online. Fair enough. So, so I'll just like real break it down. Like the oldest form of derivative is like, it's, it's like what the Egyptians you steal when they used to like grow some cotton and like they'd got, they'd know that they'd like sell it for a future price and if they got a certain price they would plant the crops. And if they didn't then they wouldn't.

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       So that was like the oldest form and then it kinda got crazy with this credit derivatives and stuff. And it's more just like technology is the way I look at it. Like an Ipad, you could say as bad if you like load porn on it and give it to an eight year old. But in theory it's not bad stuff. Uh, the problem is is when it gets a little unregulated and crazy. Well, a, I see your point and I think that what you're saying is probably correct, but I think that if you want to have a fair society and the society, that makes sense. I don't think you can have things when it comes to money and finances. I don't think you can have things that can be manipulated in any way, shape or form or things that are based at all on confidence or perceptions of how something is doing.

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       So when I look at the stock apples down in over the iPhone, it was a lump and perceived as a little fork on and we thought it was apple stock goes down. What are you even saying? What the fuck are you even saying? What kind of crazy world we live in, where there's people, the regular people who are gambling for and against a company falling apart, are doing well. And that's a part of our society and that's a part of our economy. That's crazy. Every time you buy something and you're kind of gambling, when you buy your house and wherever you live, you actually were thinking it'll, it'll probably be a good investment as opposed to if you bought a house in Tiawana than it may be wouldn't. So every decision you make with your money is kind of a bit sure. If I was saying that you should never gamble, that would make sense.

Speaker 1:          01:19:08       But that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is you can't gamble on shit that you're not even a part of and that can't be a giant part of the economy. You like when you, when you're buying stock and selling stock and trading stock and things are going up and down, the Dow is down seven points today. What the fuck are you even talking about? You've got a shit system. If the Dow is down that if it's that fluctuating up and down based on some stupid fucking build it gets passed or some lack of cower. Iran has been rattling their sabers, the Dow is down, you know, it's, that's a nonsense system. Humans are all about confidence, right? If it, if someone's, if, sure. But our economy shouldn't be based on such a weird, you know, a theorial sort of a feeling like the idea that you know, whether or not people believe that apples on the ride.

Speaker 1:          01:19:56       What about blackberry? Why the fuck are block bar now? They were on top of the world at one point in time. So it just seems like nonsense. It seems like piece of gold should equal one donkey. Okay. Back to the old school until we figure out how to have a, I mean, what was the guy's name? The young joc fresco talks about resource based economy. That's the only thing that makes sense. Economies based on numbers and derivatives and finances and stocks and bonds and why do you even saying, I just don't know how we're going to get there without having a complete bloodbath. How are we going to get to a better version of government without a complete, you only say the Internet and that's the only option we have right now. Right. I think that's, I think the Internet is eventually going to be the governing of the world, the governing of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:20:40       It's going to lead to the governing of the world through the people. I think it's only inevitable as long as people continue to have more and more access to information and more and more power to distribute that information like we do right now. And that's one of the scariest things about these tightening up bills when the bill, you know, when they're trying to stop the passing these cyber terrorism bills and these sweeping legislation that allows the government to come in and shut down websites and, and deem, you know, enemies of the state, certain wet, like wikileaks is an enemy of the state. Now, Julian Assan, Julian Assange is deemed an enemy of the state. They've decided he's as bad. It's al Qaeda. He's meanwhile, all he's done is tell the truth. Always done is distributed information that the government didn't want distributed. So they decided that this guy's a fucking terrorist.

Speaker 1:          01:21:24       Are you going to carry, I think it's nonsense. I mean, as I get older, I think it's more and more nonsense and I think it's a silly system. If Gary Johnson can't debate, okay, what you got is you gotta rig system. You've got a giant crazy rig fake system. And if I pretend that I'm a part of this stupid electorial college and, and hop on board, it's nonsense. College is still crazy, right? Every aspect of it is nuts. Lobbyists are nuts. The ability to donate corporation's ability to donate limitless amounts of money. That's nuts. That's just this term, this latest super pacs and all that. That's nuts. It's weird watching it from London. It's really weird because it seems like a big joke with Romney and Obama and it shows like a big guy. Myself Draconian Mitt Romney on Facebook last night. Joe, good for her. It was like a nice guy.

Speaker 1:          01:22:12       I liked him too. It doesn't mean that would vote for him and even if you vote for him, I think it's been pretty obvious with Obama that it's not that easy. Um, and what Obama's done. Everybody thought that Obama was going to be this great savior, this country, and it's going to, you know, I mean, I remember her, this woman who was a like all happy when he won it and now I know that my mortgage is going to be paid and now I know that I was listening to her say it was like, Whoa, you want to talk about some high expectations for someone who's going to come in and you think he's going to fix this incredibly fucking entangled corrupt system, not of his hands, Matt fix it, but he let some shit get past that. I would have never thought that the National Defense Authorization Act, which allows the military to break up civil descent they met, allows the military to be used on US civilians.

Speaker 1:          01:22:57       It allows people to be held without authorization. It allows to be w without rather representation, without any recourse. You can't, you can't have a trial. They can just hold you indefinitely as long as everyone is terrifying. It's terrifying. They would ask for that. Here's why. It's not like things have gone horribly bad in this country. It's not like there's riots in the streets every day and people are assassinating government leaders and there's bomb blowing up and buildings everywhere and we have resorted to like some sort of arcane law that we're going to have to put into place until we can calm things down. We've got to control the, no, it's not that, but cool. Walk down the street Pasadena. It's beautiful out here, man. Get on the highway. There's a few. Too many cars. People are civil. You know, you've got hours and hours of bumper to bumper traffic and the worst thing is somebody might blow the horn and stick a finger out at somebody.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       No one's cutting people's heads off with swords. You know, it's, it's not necessary to pass these crazy Orwellian laws. But what it makes me think is that they can see the writing on the wall and they know that this form of running governments, it's no longer valid. It doesn't work. It's ridiculous. We, we understand your influence, we understand why you're making these decisions. We see where the money comes from now. It's all readily available. It's not like we're living in 1930 and I have to read the Hearst newspapers to find out what the information is, you know, is going to be about this upcoming election. You can find out anything about anybody. It's, it's, it's really different now and it's not saying that we don't need a government. We certainly need to government. It's not saying we shouldn't have corporations. Of course we should have corporations.

Speaker 1:          01:24:25       I, there's a lot of corporations that I think are great. I think Apple's great. I think Porsche is great. I think I like their products. I think you know what I mean? I, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just we can't allow money to supersede humanity and that's what they've done. They've allowed the idea of doing their stockholders justice and making as much money as possible. They've allowed that to supersede humanity and when you have businesses where their entire function is to supersede humanity, you can see that and you can, you can measure that, that we need to stop that. That needs to be closed down. They got to stop it for themselves because they're all having fucking horrible Karma from that, you know? And yeah, that's gotta be best comparable man. If you, have you thought about having politicians on the show? A few.

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       We've got a guy that young David Seaman, he's coming back again when the couple of weeks want to come on your show or we go, why don't we get one, two, maybe Gary Johnson would, but he's, you know, he's legit. You know, I spoke to Ron. Paul had a chance to speak to him on the tonight show. I never asked him to come on the podcast because I thought it would be ridiculous. Siemens comes in. He wouldn't come on. Yeah, he's coming on again. But you have problem with that. No, I said Siemens. How dare you fucking child. There you go. That's what you're talking. Exactly like the needle off the records of my manchild barking in the distance to put your credit Joe. So this is our one year anniversary pretty much since for you guys to show. Yeah. And I mean obviously it was, it was pretty much after watching your show.

Speaker 1:          01:25:50       I mean the splitscreen was pretty much an owed. He used to shoot it I think at your house, right? Yeah. Well we started doing it because of, uh, Anthony coolio. Really. He was the big push. I mean, when, uh, we went to, um, uh, the Anthony show and Anthony has a show called live from the compound and he was the, he actually has a fucking six set up. He has a green screen and a broadcast desk and really high end microphones. And Him and his buddies would get drunk and do a show. And we were like, me and Brian were like, Dad looks fun. Is it video as well? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So we started doing it all. It'll be three years for us in December. We started doing it on just on a Ustream, on a, on a, on a laptop. And you guys were on sofas, right?

Speaker 1:          01:26:28       And then, yeah, we didn't in my house just chilling at my house. We were bored when you're infected us over in London, you know. Well, you know, like I said, we were infected first. We've come up with this idea called global real. And we want to, we want to facilitate the setting up of like some of the things in real in every major city in the world or anybody who wants to just do a podcast. We've talked to some guys actually in Victoria, British Columbia. There's a guy over there, Eric Faust, and we talked to him recently on Skype and he's like, I want to do a podcast. I'm like, just do it. You know, if you want some help, let's do it. And he's like, I want to call it Victoria real with your permission. And I was like, dude, that's awesome. I know the name, you know, but I was like, this is not another London real. You're good. Right. We'll have to bust. This is up.

Speaker 1:          01:27:08       There can't be enough podcasts right now. I don't that I, I, you know, there's a lot of people that feel like the other people that are doing podcasts or somehow or another, the competition. I don't feel that at all. I never have. I feel like there's 300 million fucking human beings just in this country and hundreds of millions worldwide that also listen to anything English. I think this is a huge audience for everybody and I, I don't think that it has to be us against them. I, I'm inspired by other comedians just like I'm inspired by other podcasts, but I'm a big, I'm a big believer in the way to be successful in the way to feel good is to help other people, to help other people do things mentality though. Yeah. That's one of the first signs of an enlightened human being as he knows is enough for everyone.

Speaker 1:          01:27:55       He doesn't have to claw and scrape and say, this is mine. You know? And once you start sending that energy out into the universe to experience becomes very, very different. Right. I think my standup comedy, all of it has benefited from that. My life has benefited from it. I'm just to, I think you have to be a generous person. I'm like, I'll regularly go to a coffee shop and leave like a hundred dollar tip. I just, I think you've got to do that. I think I leave like a little happiness bombs. Like I always joke a joke about it. Like my friend Duncan and I were we a eight at this barbecue place and uh, you know, a tip, the waiter a hundred bucks and he didn't even know it. But with laughs, thanks. Bye. And I'm like, get out of there. Like I love the fact that dude's going to open up the thing and see a hundred bucks, motherfucker just give me 100 bucks and you're gone mad and I'm gone. So happiness bomb, you know, it's uh, and I think that that sort of mentality, I've also put that to stand up, you know, and all of us would do that already does that, Duncan does that. Brian does that. Joey Diaz does that, you know, we're the first guys to tell you about someone that we think is great and someone that we'd love something you should check out and uh, it's aided all of us. You know what you get, what'd you give you get back

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       10 times, right? That's a little bit, yeah, I think so. Man. I've, you know, there's a lot of comics who bring guys on the road with them that are terrible so they don't show them up. I've always been of the mindset that I should bring the funniest human beings that are available so that the shows better and it makes me laugh like I don't, I'm not, it's not going to make me less funny. Like that idea is crazy to me. Like there's a lot of people that actually want the person who's on in front of them to not be funny because then it makes them look better. And I think that's that mean if you, if that's the worst way of thinking ever. Because that's your, so your, your sense of what it's funny or what's funny about you is so delicate that no one else can also be funny.

Speaker 5:          01:29:41       Like that's crazy. Like sometimes you're funny but you're only funny if someone before you sucks. That doesn't even make sense. It's a hold of the wrong mentality. Same thing. It's a lack of that abundance mentality and a lack of the real idea that human beings are inexorably connected, that we're connected by energy. And that we're connected by intent and then we're, we're connected by the, the thoughts that we put out there and the thoughts that we received from, from other people. There's, it's not, it's not this woo woo thing. This is a real exchange of energy. And I've been impressed by the power of a conversation. Like we get on on the air once a week and we have an hour conversation with someone who we think is important and that's why we put them in the center of the screen. We want to feature these people to the world, whether it's Simon Powell with a siliciden solution or you know, an MMA fighter or somebody and say, check this dude out.

Speaker 5:          01:30:31       But it's, it's had a big effect on me. I mean, I've grown so much as a person this last year, it's probably been the best year of my life and this is like 10 years in financial markets and making money and doing this. But like this last year I've changed the most I can drink Iowasca two years ago I would have been the dude that glazes over. When you talk about psychedelics and like, oh, you're one of those fucks. No, and now I'm doing it. And like he made you, what made you uh, have a, an an altering of that idea? You know, I walked away from that job because I, I dunno, I think a lot of times as young males were sold this kind of, this, this capitalist promise, when you go to school, you make the money, you get the girl, you have the car and you, and you're happy.

Speaker 5:          01:31:09       And I'm a, a lot of our viewers, I ain't got the same way that like these guys in their mid twenties that think they're playing the game and they're like, okay, then we're all my rewards. And they're like, I'm not happy with this anymore. And I think I got there, I was doing this day in, day out job and it was quote unquote successful and I had all the trappings and then I was just like, I wasn't happy. So I just walked away from it. Scared as hell wouldn't it with nothing to do for six months. I was like literally not doing much. And Nick and I would meet in the west end and walk around London for like three hours and I was listening to your podcast and we walk and we talk about philosophy and women in finance and perspectives. And at the end I'd be like, nick, that would've made a fucking good punk if we had just recorded it, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:31:49       And then Nick's like, let's do it. Let's do it, let's do it. And then um, there like arrived at Brian's house. I thought it was going to be us like talking into garageband and fines up this huge studio and there's a microphone in my face and that's awesome. It was cool. And we got the cameras. I thought the video was super important because I listen to audio podcasts before, but you need to seek guys faces. And I always say for our guests, people need to see at least the first five minutes because they need to see if their account or not or if there are a Douche. And you can tell after five minutes of looking at someone, I think you can say, okay, I like this guy's vibe. And then you can listen if you want. You can tell from listening to, you know, I was listening to the opiate Anthony Show and there was a guy on, I was like, man, this guy sounds like a cunt to me.

Speaker 5:          01:32:29       Like they're being nice to the guy, but I'm like this guy sounds like a douche bag. So I asked a friend and knew him. He goes, oh, it's a piece of shit. I go, oh thank you. I go cause I was like, this guy is playing these guys. I was like, there's something about this guy that is so disingenuous. And as soon as I asked my friend, I knew it was like, oh he's a piece of shit, a fucking hate that guy. I was like, thank you just by listening, by listening man. But I agree with you about the video, but the reality is the majority of our listeners are audio only more than 70% I think. Is it really 90% yeah. We have a big butt. I say I was more like 60% I'd say. Well between Stitcher, which is, are you guys on stage, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          01:33:08       It's cool. It's a cool service. Don't tell bill burr. Stitcher is a one, one great way that we're distributed through smart phones. But now there's the, you know the iPhone app on the new iPhones, they have a podcast app and we have our own podcast APP. You can find the Joe Rogan experience podcast APP. It's free. Um, but the audio version is where people like listen to it on the train or in their car or the gym or whatever. I think that's much more, more prevalent. Very few assholes are sitting in front of the computer watching. I usually watch the first few minutes just to take a look at the guests and then I switched to audio. We got gifts by the way. Might as well drop these guys, these things on you guys. You have gifts for us. How dare you. I know, huh? Hopefully you brought batteries for you and that's for you, right Ben?

Speaker 5:          01:33:53       Oh, no way. Brian, did you say that with a gay accent? You son of a bitch and that's some crazy ass London real now it's actually some posters. I didn't have any wrapping paper that going on at Sun. We've got to get wrapping paper. That's kind of cool, right? Swabbed wrapping paper, face mess. Come on dude. You can put that up to the camp squad wrapping paper. I'm telling Ya, this guy, whoever you where that came with the higher primate tattoo, this guy had the dopest fucking one of my tee shirt designs on his shoulder. The Sheba one. Uh, he had it done on the shoulder by this wicked tattoo artists, whoever you were, you've solved fucking son of a bitch. That was a bad ass tattoo dude. You've got pride gloves for me. He goes, are some originals where they used? No, that was uh, I went to pride I think is no five at Japan and never been used. So, and then Robin's got the classic English pride gloves are actually better, better than the gloves that the UFC uses in one way. Is that the, the padding goes more over the end of the fingers and it kind of keeps you curled. I feel like there were less. I pokes and pride. Do you feel that? But I can remember. I don't remember a single eye poking pride is awesome. That was

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       fun. It was awesome. I still love it. It's cool. It was such a crazy time. Those fights were nuts, man. Like there's no other organization that would have put on minute Toro versus Bob Sapp. It was a great fight. That was craziness, man. I mean it was like they were almost superheroes. Don't know what we're talking about. Minotauro is this guy who's like the original Jujitsu heavyweight, the original guy, the first guy really to come along, start submitting high end guys from his back. Nobody did that before. Minute Toro and he fought this guy named Bob Sapp Bush. Literally 370 pounds all muscle. He was fucking ridiculous and it was a crazy fight where Bob's sab pile drived Minataro at one point in time, Meta time was more than a hundred pounds lighter than a more than a hundred I think he's probably 150 pounds lighter than them. It was craziness and he slapped the arm by arm and arm bar at the end and caught him in an arm bar.

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       Spoiler alert, sorry. As proper upset. Probably couldn't extend his arm more than that. So it was ridiculous. Bob Sat was so big, he didn't look real. He made so much money in Japan endorsing products and stuff. He made millions of it then. Yeah. But then the market kind of fell apart from what I understand. We're going to get ensign anyway on the podcast. Last time instance in America have him, yeah, he's great. Went into Fukushima until the good stuff. That was one intense dude. That guy is the real deal. And he uh, you know, he was there during the whole, like the height of pride and he was also there when it, when it dropped off. So He'd probably be the one that could tell you what the fuck really happened when he comes on the podcast. Maybe we'll get it from him. And James Thompson, he was in involved as production, right?

Speaker 1:          01:36:37       Yeah, the Colossus. Yeah, he's on my, met my message board now and he's, uh, he writes a lot of blogs. He's actually a very good writer. Okay. Really interesting cat. You know, cause he's this big scary looking motherfucker but he's actually a really wealth, well thought out, well spoken guy. And he sent us a message the other day, he sent me Mr. Smith Facebook and I was like, I can't be the same. James Thompson, he's a great guy, man. Cool. Hi James, I'm going to get back to you. Like I said, he's on, he's on my message board all the time. He's a great guy. MMA guys are cool dudes. Yeah, it's, I think it's along the same lines when we talked about with Jujitsu. The only difference with them and May of course is that you have to consider thank you very much for his gloves by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:37:15       You were awesome man. You have to consider with MMA, um, the, the, the potential for longterm damage to your mind. You just have to consider that. And so these guys always have that sort of hanging over their head. And I think that's one of the reasons why you really can't enjoy it. Like you can enjoy Jujitsu, like Jujitsu. Even when you, you, you tap somebody, you don't feel bad because you get tapped to everybody taps you just, just part of the whole game. It's like he needs to learn that, you know, you can't put your arm there if the guy's a got your back and he's got the, you know, he needs to learn what he did wrong in that position because you see, it's not like if you got hydro in that position, you've could have tapped him or you know, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       It's like it's a lesson for everybody. So you don't even feel bad about delivering the lesson because if you're trying to get good at Jujitsu, ultimately you should welcome getting tapped because it exposes you. You're your true weaknesses, otherwise you're really not going to know. And the only way to get better is to see those weaknesses, shore up those holes and move forward. So someone who taps, he was actually helping you. And that's, that aspect doesn't exist in kickboxing, kickboxing man. You only have a certain ratatat tat that you could take to your head. You only, you'll have a certain number man. And when you deliver, especially when you deliver on a sparring partner, there's part of you that knows that you just did some damage. When you uncork a right hand on someone, you see their eyes roll back in their knees buckle. You know, you just fucked that guy's consciousness up for us to live smarter these days.

Speaker 1:          01:38:39       I know Mac, Dan was here talking about that. Do you think a lot of fighters have had that new philosophy of I'm going to train smarter, not harder. I think some of them have certainly. Um, but some of them don't have as a access to the most tactical trainers. You know, there's some trainers, like there's this, the Matt Hume's of the world who have you watched their fighters. There are fighters are so obviously well trained, very obviously technical Winkle. John's fighters are also very similar. Like you, there are super obviously, well technically trained. You Watch cowboy Cerrone move, you know, you watch, um, what Jon Jones is learning. He's, these guys are learning very good technique and the only way to truly do that is to be taught by someone who is at the front of the game. Someone who really knows what the fuck is up. Someone who has a super technical standup game and knows how to, to move a fighter through progression, challenged them and test them and, but, but not have them get mall, not have them get beat up and figure out a way to balance all that out because it takes one bad punch and like, yeah, you'll never be the same fighter again.

Speaker 1:          01:39:44       Yeah. I've seen guys that especially kicks, I've seen guys that got kicked in the head and we're never the same and that is, that is 100% real, especially, um, like, like there's certain kicks like wheel kicks and things along those lines where there's an insane amount of power. Like if you look at Lens on your head, right? Edson Barboza versus Terry Edom, fine. We're, we're Edson Barboza Knock Terry at, I'm out with the wheel kick in Brazil. I mean, it was walkin nasty. I mean the heel connected right to the jaw, the consciousness was gone instantly. He fell down like he was dead. Those kind of knockouts, man. How many of those you got in your life? I mean, do you have five? Do you have a number? Like five and after that you'll never be the same person. Is it one? Is it two? Is it three? We really don't know because it varies per person.

Speaker 1:          01:40:32       Do you see these guys fade sometimes? I mean, you're in their weekend and week out commentating as you have C's. Do you ever see that? You know that Terry Adam Guy and you're like, wait a second, he's not moving in the same way. He used to no question about it. You could see it in their, their speech patterns. Some guys, a lot of, you know, look, the underground is a mixed martial arts forum that I frequent. Uh, mixed martial arts are com the best, in my opinion, the best mixed martial arts website on the world. And uh, shut up bitch. And one of, one of the things, uh, have you been, haven't been to share it. They're good to their old school. It's a great website too. There's just a few too many cons on the board. They're just a little better at squashing. Cantinas I, although I here, I shouldn't say that cause I hear shirt docs gotten a lot better about it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:16       Anyway. My point is like they're, they're ruthless because they're hiding behind an anonymous screen names, but sometimes they're accurate and every now and then they'll put up a video and said, is, does so-and-so seem to have brain damage? And then you listen to when you're like, wow, that guy is struggling. Like there's certain, like there was a video with Paul Williams recently where he was, um, you know Paul, you'll Williams the boxer who got knocked out by Sergio Martinez with vicious one punch knockout. And then he was in a motorcycle accident, which left him paralyzed and they interviewed him in the motorcycle and I was listening to his labored speech and I was like, Ooh, that doesn't sound good. So horrible man. Yeah, I met, I would, while it didn't mean it, but I was right behind Terry Adams or a Terry. I'm Norris rather when he was talking to a fan once and uh, I was a huge Terry Norris fan when I was a kid.

Speaker 1:          01:42:00       He was like one of my favorite boxers and Terry Norris was a standing there talking to this dude and I couldn't believe it was real. I thought he was hammered drunk or something. I thought they only, this cannot be real. This cannot be how this guy talks now. And so I like inched over clothes and listen to their conversation and oh my God, it was so sad. It was the saddest fucking thing to me because being a big fan of this guy and watching his fight so many times, he was, you know, this really wild dude. And he, he got knocked out a few times and he was one of those guys. It was either, it was either he would kill or be killed, you know, and uh, he got knocked out by some Badass dudes like Julian Jackson knocked him out, like fucking scary knockouts and to see him when he was younger than me at the time.

Speaker 1:          01:42:47       And to see him slurring his words like that scared the fucking shit out of me, man. Just scare the shit out of me. You've seen Meldrick Taylor lately. Have you seen that horrific, horrific Meldrick Taylor was one of the best boxers, you know, to ever come out of the Olympics and his early professional days, he was fucking wizard. He was so fast and he had one really, really brutal fight with Julio. Cesar Chavez. Never the same again. And then Terry Norris knocked him out. A few guys knocked him out, but he's still fighting. And they had an interview with him recently on Hbo when they showed him when he was younger talking and then they showed him today. And it's horrendous. It's, it's, that is a real reality of combat sports. Do you, do you think the UFC is safe enough now or do you think in 10 years we're going to start seeing blow back?

Speaker 1:          01:43:31       And is there any way the other way around that, I mean, humans want to see combat sports, right? Well look, here's what safe. You've got to get out before you have irreparable damage. That's what safe guys have done it. There's guys who have retired and they're, they're fine and healthy. Look, Marvin Hagler is apparently in great, great health and you know, he was a great boxer but he never got knocked. It never got fucked up, you know, and Hagler new after the sugar ray Leonard fight. All right, I'm done. Cause it never came back. Rocky Marciano did the same thing, got out before he got really fucked up. [inaudible] was fine in his later years before he died in a plane crash. But you, you can figure out when, but you have to be, you have to be really smart and it's hard to do. And it's also, you have to have something that excites you.

Speaker 1:          01:44:13       Like fighting does cause these guys, it's not like you can fight and all sudden you can't fight anymore. It's, you can fight and you fight just a little less good than you used to and it fucks with your head and you're like, you know what man, I just need to change my training up. I need to incorporate some fucking swimming or something. You know? And you'll try to do that and then you get knocked out again and you're like, wow, I was winning that first round until I got caught. You know? And then then like Jens Pulver is still going, still going at it. And you guys still good enough to stay in the game but only just only just, and those, those knockouts, those all become ticket wholes, wholes in your ticket to chunk where your ticket gets punched over and over again. And how many you got?

Speaker 1:          01:44:50       Who knows? I mean Allister's has been stopped a bunch of times, but you look at him now, he's better than ever. Overeem. Yeah. Over Ian's been stopped. But Peter Arts, Peter Hertz has been stopped a gang of times. Still beat semis felt two years ago in the k one Grand Prix. So it's like some guys, they can get stopped a bunch of times and still be okay and other guys not. And I don't have the drawer right at the end of the day, no one can tell you, no one can tell. You know, some guys like Mark Hunt can take a fucking ferocious shot, you know? And then there's other guys who just, they can't take that much punishment. They're built differently. They, they, for whatever it's worth, who knows what it is. It was some person as a glass jaw, the other guy's got an iron draw. How much of it is psychological?

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       How much of it is physical? It's hard to tell. It's a combination of both, I'm sure. But it, it's not a safe sport. It's, uh, it's, it's safe as we can make it, but the fighters all realize that there's a certain amount of risk involved. You're going to get injured, you're going to get broken bones, you're going to get torn ligaments are going to get concussions. You're going to have that in mixed martial arts. There's no way around that. So in that sense, it's as safe as we can make it, but it's a dangerous sport. So they have to think about that and they have to train with that in mind and they have to understand when it's time to not do it anymore. Yeah, me off, someone says, oh, the ref shouldn't have stopped the fight. It's like, man, always err on the side of caution when it's someone's brain in jeopardy.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       You know what I mean? Uh, I think some guys, you got to let them try to get at like Frankie Edgar, perfect example. How do you stop that guys? Flights early. When you see like that first round back, was it gray Maynard two fights in a row. You see that and you go, how could you stop that guys fight is you gotta you gotta look at the individual and his ability to bounce back from punishment and you gotta get up. Gotta give him the opportunity to win. And Frankie's proven time and time again that he can do that. So in that sense, the referee has to be an expert in, in fighters, particular styles and their ability to endure punishment. It's not the best way to, to compete. But with a guy like Frankie Edgar, it's also one of his weapons, one of his weapons is that he's incredible shape and that he recovers quickly and you know, he can wear a guy out because of that.

Speaker 1:          01:46:55       He can do drag a guy into sub crazy fucking firefight where you know he's got a thousand bullets and the other guy might only have 400 so you know, he might think, oh, I've got 400 bullets, this guy's fucking dead. Meanwhile, he could keep going man, and like, you know, the fourth round with gray Maynard when he knocked him out and it's like, God damn, he's still going. He's still going at the same clip he was going in the first round and gray couldn't manage that at that point and his in his career. What's it like behind the scenes at UFC? I mean, what, what would, what would we be surprised at? Something you just notice all the time when you're calling those fights in the UFC. I don't know man. You know, it's, it's, it's a weird job. It's a weird, it's a weird job.

Speaker 1:          01:47:32       Even for me, it's hard to believe that it is my job. Like whenever I do it, it's hard to believe. I put on the headphones and they talked to me in the booth. I'm like, what's up? What's up? What's up? You're ready to do this. Let's do this. Goldie and I touched knuckles and the first fight, we're going to start in five, four tr charter, the music plays and the lights go on. You're like, wow, I guess this is my job. It's not hard to imagine there. They're paying you to do that even seem real. It doesn't seem real. It doesn't seem that I'm the one who's, who represents the, the, the, the techniques and I'm the one who explains to people what to look for and what's going on. It's, it's very strange. So even while I'm doing it, I'm doing it to the best of my abilities.

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       And the best of my knowledge, it's still bizarre is fuck, I have a hard time believing it's really happening while I'm doing it. I always tell people were like you and Goldberg, like I'm the Goldberg. Cause like I got a bunch of questions. I gotta ask Hancock for example. And then Nick's kind of like the play by play flow. He just like, if he's feeling something, he just asked that question and then I'm like, okay, I gotta get to these things. I got to say the fighter does this, it does this next week on Fox, you can watch this show. Yeah, yeah. That's Goldberg's move. Yeah, it's, it's a difficult job. He doesn't get nearly as much credit as he deserves. He's really good at that. He's really smooth. People just get upset that he's not a martial artist. But the bottom line is you really have to be an actual martial artist to do martial arts commentary.

Speaker 1:          01:48:51       There is no way around it. You can't fake it. You can't not know how to take someone's back and explain how he's got to take us back. You can't, if you see someone who's doing something, you know what? I'll see someone occasionally, I'm like, you can't let go of that under hook. I'm like, if this guy, let's go with that under hook, this motherfucker is going to take us back. Like especially a guy like honey, ya, ya or someone is like a super high level guy like honey. Yah, Yah. One of his recent fights, he got site control on this guy and as soon as he reached back, I'm like, oh, he's going north south choke. And I called it like several steps ahead. But with a god like honey, you can see it like I know what he's gonna do. You can't let him wrap his arm around your neck and you let him reach back with that left arm.

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       You might as well just go to sleep and just take a nap cause he's gonna choke you. And that's step one of a three step process. You're not gonna be able to stop because once he got step one, he's he's basis set and you're done and you know you, you got to know that there's no way you can know that without doing that. Listen to the early or the commentary in the early year of CS. It's hysterical because these guys were like boxing commentators and something that they just had no idea. Right. You got it. You got to, the hardest part to me is the ground game because there's so much varied. There's a lot of variables in standup for sure. There's, it's not that standup is easy, but there's infinite variables on the ground and you have to understand the, the, the various different styles of attacking different positions.

Speaker 1:          01:50:13       Like everybody's got there at like some guys, they'll go side control on a guy and face towards the feet and they'll, they'll be like, guys will try to get a gun at twister or tried to get someone's back. And then there's other guys that go judo style and they're going to look for, you know, the, the, the mounted crucifix. They're going to look to ground and pound or they're going to look for a scarf whole or some, some kind of like mark home. Mark Coleman did that to Dan Severen. It was like when the first submissions in the UFC heavyweight division, when he won the title, you, you, you, you have to see all those, you have to understand those, you have to have been strangled. You have to, you have to get somebody with it. You have to fight it off. You have to. If you don't, you're not going to be able to explain to people what this guy's doing wrong or what he needs to do or what.

Speaker 1:          01:50:53       And that's what makes it more exciting when, when a guy is doing, like Jimmy Smith is really good at it from Bella tour with Jimmy Smith, if a guy's got someone's back, he's like, he's got, he's got to defend with his right arm while he's attacking with his leg, you know, he'll, he'll explain to people and if you're a person who's a, an amateur or someone who has nothing to do with martial arts, you can watch it and fall on, oh, I see what that guy's doing. He's right. He's going to choke that guy. Oh yeah. Yeah. And the other guy, he's saying he's got out, got to get his leg Frey, otherwise it's going to get you. Oh, I see. Yeah. He's holding him with his legs and it, it, it, it adds to the excitement. And that's, you can't be a sports guy and do that.

Speaker 1:          01:51:28       You have to be a martial artist. And that note, Joe, what's your favorite submission? Chokes the color or no, no, no, no, no, no. I hate that. I do. Yeah. I have a black belt under John Jackson Hole, but I don't fucking use it. I use over hooks and under hooks. I, I believe that if your game is gay oriented, the, the good thing about the gies defense, the good thing about the Biggie is you must be tactical in your defense. You have to be tactical in your tax can't because a guy gets a hold of your collar or a guy gets a hold of your sleeve. There's a lot of shit they could do to you. We, if you were slippery, and with Nokia you can just muscle out of it, but you have to use technique and you have to do it the right way with a g.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       So in that way, looking at good, you're like a doss and Bravo. But I think that, um, or rear nakeds and gay teens. But I think that the beautiful thing about a g is if you're fighting a guy who's got a coat on, you know some guys got a leather jacket on who's talking shit like, oh you have to do is grab his collar and he's dead and what's happening? All you have to do is get a hand. He won't even know what you're doing. He'll be trying to punch you and you just reach into his college. You know what I find interesting, I'm an, I don't know if you remember there was that scientists, there was a a group of islands that had different monkey tribes on and what was happening is when one monk in one on and learn one, learn

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       how to pick a certain Manana, we'll open a certain fruit. Then all the other monkeys learned it and it's a similar thing with Jujitsu, like suddenly like you'll just see this new choke in the game that you've never seen before and then in three months everyone knows it. It's such an interesting thing. Darcy's came along now way that's made me think of it kick that Anderson Silva Front kick after they started doing everybody. Well that was so dramatic. That was something that everybody saw. But what I think what you're saying is that it's just like spreads through schools because people just figure it out at the same time because they watched you two photos sometimes. Well there's also one technique, like there'll be like a new technique that like one of them was attacking from the half guard. One of the things that opened up the Darce was at a lot of people were attacking from the half guard and they were going with a double underhooks attack.

Speaker 5:          01:53:31       And when they're going with a double under hooks attack, a lot of guys were sneaking their arms in and then all of a sudden it became Anaconda, chokes, Doris chokes. It became, that's what people were going for it because you subset of God basically. Yeah. And it was basically to, to deal with under hooks that a guy, you know, if, so if you're in a guys, you're on the side of a guy, like maybe in half guard and a guy's like has a really strong under hook. If you, you know that if you get your arm under his under hook and passes neck and connect your arms together, now he's in a bit of trouble. You just put yourself in a dangerous situation. Like you're trying to be very offensive budding, allowing me to wizard, you're underhooking pass by your neck, now you've allowed me to control your neck, now I've got a position on you.

Speaker 5:          01:54:11       And now especially if you go Japanese Necktie, which is one of the new moves that a lot of guys are doing now and said, I've never even heard of that and we're got to show it to you as the shit. He's way more high. It's way more percentage, way more high percentage than a, than a Doris. Let me ask your question cause you control the guy's head check question about London and, and what you think of London. Well, he, I think he was going to, I was cut him off on the show. I'm always like, no, it's hard to do that right here. We have an hour. You're rude to like, to like, uh, you know, to cut people off, but you know, you're not meaning to, it's just like you have a thought and if you don't say come on down to the scapes and it gets away from you.

Speaker 5:          01:54:44       Cause the conversation derivatives I have, I have, I have two dude. I'm sorry. I'll never forgive myself. So the first one is, um, do you think if you go to a time machine and traveled a hundred years into the future and then walk into a Jujitsu Academy, do you think you'd still be able to hang? Like I'd get killed? Do you think so? I'm pretty sure. My interesting. Yeah. Unless, unless a, they were fucking terrible like fuck ups from white belts. Yeah, I guess so. But I think black belts, well, black belts, they're really good black belts. I'm not, you know, I'm a week black belt, like objectively, like I'm strong, don't get me wrong, I'm a have strong Jujitsu. But as far as like high end black belt guys, I used to get tapped, you know, it's just, it's just reality. You know, I'm not a world champion. I remember the time to put into that too. In order. I have much more potential. I mean, if I really had the time to train five days a week and get a strength and conditioning, I think I could jump my game up big. I think my, my mind is way more ahead of my body. It's just, I don't have the time to do it. I don't know when it's time to put in the numbers

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       in between having a family and doing standup, doing a podcast and traveling for the UFC, it's hard to try to train as much as I can. And when I train, I do. I give 100% but he's still writing a book or, yeah. Yeah. I just got to do you feel like you need to get a book out of, you know, um, I would like to do it. I have a, I have a lot of shit already written and I will eventually put it out. But right now I'm concentrating on my new studio and my standup special, which is going to be out at the end of the month and the end of October. Is that already in the can? It's, yeah, it's already in the can. It's just a matter of the website getting built, which is, it takes a lot longer than you think to have a nice website made. So that's being made.

Speaker 1:          01:56:19       And then, um, just to get the infrastructure in place to share it. It, I, I found out somewhere along the line that when I do too many things at the same time, I don't have any fun and joy. Everything suffers. A family and everything. Yeah. Well I won't let that suffer. So the things that suffer or other aspects of my career, so I limit the amount of shit that I do. So once this standup specials out and I can not think about that, boom. Then I'm diving full into writing. I'm writing the book because I already have the, I have to balance it out with writing standup, which right now is more important because my special is about to drop and I have a whole new hour that I've basically put together between the time I did the special and now what do you want from your stand up like in five years from now?

Speaker 1:          01:57:00       I mean do you want to see like bigger audiences or do you ever have goals like that? No, no. I'm, I'm super happy with the way. If, if nothing changed at all then the other than the way it is right now. If it just maintained a, I'd be the happiest person on earth. I have the greatest audiences in the history of that. The the art form. It's the craziest thing ever. I wish you guys could come to see some of these crowds because they're crazy and it's mostly podcast fans. It's mostly people who don't just resonate with the idea of comedy, but resonate with the idea that there's someone out there that's also confused by all this and there's someone out there that's being honest about all of it and those people. I've, I've, I've sort of found a, found a huge amount of them because of this podcast and I don't, I don't desire anything more than that.

Speaker 1:          01:57:42       It's already the, just having all the people come up to me after shows. All the people that tell me they've lost weight and all the people that told me they've got their shit together, that they've, they're living their life like they're the hero in their own story. It's a great way, and it should be like the blockbuster moment in the movie every day. You should be saving the girl. You shouldn't be that. You could, you could be, you could literally do what the hero would do, you know? And it doesn't mean, you know, rescue babies had a burning buildings. It means don't be a cunt. Figured out a way to get your shit together. Don't, don't be someone who's just slacking off and jerking off while behind you is a mountain of work to do, you know, get, get, get your stuff done, do it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:19       Do it. Do be someone who you admire. And that's something that I, I had to learn on my own slowly over a long period of time. But in reiterating that on the podcast, just like in teaching Jujitsu, it's become like very concrete in my head. You know, I'm have another very deep and meaningful question of I want your input on it. In fact, me and my Jujitsu buddies debate about the solar, the time, and some of them want your, your, your input, which is, um, what do you think would win in a fight out of a silverback gorilla and a bangle? Tiger, tiger, tiger themselves. Show that gorilla. Come on man. See I say gorilla man. He can rip a car, tire and half with his bare hands. Right? That shit with that Tiger's got your back and choking giant. I refuse. I don't think the tiger would fuck with the gorilla because it's not going to be easy.

Speaker 1:          01:59:06       I think it's going to be a struggle. That's why gorillas nest on the ground, you know, gorillas don't give a fuck. They're there 500 pounds and they're five foot four natural predators. They, they're so strong. I mean, we can't even wrap our heads around how strongly are, because chimps are strong as fuck. And gorillas would rape a chimp with their little one inch Dick. You know, gorillas have tiny decks and know that because they're so dominant, they don't have any pressure from other males. And the women, the female gorillas are so in line with how everything's supposed to be. They're not sluts at all. Female chimps are whores. They will fuck anybody comes around and mail chimp's know this. Some mail chimps have giant testicles. And the reason why they have giant testicles is they always gotta be ready to go with a big fat load for one of these dirty bitches.

Speaker 1:          01:59:48       That's a part of the show that's a part of the chimp world. All animals that live in promiscuous societies, all, they all have large testicles, including human beings. There's a direct correlation between the size of a man's testicles. And the promise cues. You have the women in your environment. When you going to Africa on Safari, I know you always said you're scared of Africa. This is a real safari dude. You Go Botswana. Yeah, but you know when you go dude, you go to these wildlife sort of containment areas where you know everybody gets in Africa, you can go to propose Botswana, you can go by line. There was a whole fucking story recently about a these two female lions that broke into a house and pulled a guy out of the shower. He was showering, he was naked, showering and he got killed by two female.

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       Let's do all that. They do all the hunting and nails. Just sit around. Could you wrap your head around it so you're not trying to Africa. So He da, he da and you hear something. You open the fucking curtain. There's two lions in the bathroom with you, two female lions and they just put the beaten on you, sign, rip you to shreds and drag you out. Okay, what's the best way to go? Africa. Africa can suck my Dick. Okay. I'm not going to wear all the scary animals live bears. So Joe, if you have to choose a way to die, like would you rather be in the, in the water with a great white or no, you're not going to want, if me into a fucking heart attack. I'm fucking scared of all of them, man. I'm scared of tigers. I'm scared of sharks. I'm scared of everything dude.

Speaker 1:          02:01:27       Sound scared of all that shit, Joe, by the way, that the ancient alien documentary, amazing thing that you tweeted talk. Did you watch the whole thing? I watched, I watched all three hours. Yeah, I should. I should give that guy props. Um, there's a, a video that I tweeted yesterday, today is October the second and if you go to the October, the first feed, I tweeted this video where this guy, he must have like massive autism because this guy went and debunked every single point that ancient aliens has ever put forth about how humans could have never built this. This is impossible. He fucking stomped a dirty mud hole in every fucking show that they've ever done. And he did it. It's over three hours long. It's on youtube and there's no question, no question, no question. And you're like, okay, yeah, it's so good.

Speaker 1:          02:02:23       It said, just go to ancient aliens debunked and you want full movie fixed audio. That's the version. The other one had a little weird glitch in the audio, but it's still, it's still, you can still watch it. It's still excellent. And it's called the guy's youtube name is what does it, verse by verse bt. That's it. It's one word verse by verse bt that his, his uh, his youtube page and it's a brilliant job. Whoever this guy is, thank you very much. Because what you did is you cleared up so much confusion and for me there was a lot of stuff that I really didn't understand. There's still some stuff that hasn't been explained. There's a, some of the things about Puma Puma coup and the way they, uh, they move stones and fit them in. I think it's very interesting that you know, that this guy was able to find so many pieces of evidence that point to how they did certain things and explain how they built obelisks and giant stones and, and show ones that were in the process of being made when they abandoned.

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       So you can clearly see how they did it. Fascinating. And also yet some brilliant insight on the construction of the pyramids that I had never heard before about the theory of the internal ramp because the question has always been like how they, how they placed the stones, how did they move them into place? And uh, they actually did some sort of a, um, uh, like an x ray of the, uh, with some radio wave graph of the pyramid and you can actually see the internal ramp and they didn't understand what that was when they first made this, uh, this reading of the, the actual structure of the pyramid of Giza until this internal ramp theory came into play. And this guy examines the internal ramp theory and shows all the evidence for it, including areas of the pyramid where at certain points you could actually go in through the side of the pyramid, there's a hole and you can go in and see where there's all this space in there and most likely that's how it was built.

Speaker 1:          02:04:20       What does Graham Hancock saying? That's what I want to know. Either way this, listen, listen, this, this, um, ancient aliens debunking. What it does is explain how all these things were done. Would, it doesn't explain is how they figured this out. Would, it doesn't explain is what kind of intense mathematics were involved in the equations of 2 million, 300,000 stones each. What each of them cut so perfectly that they meet exactly in a point at the top. It's amazing. I mean when it doesn't explain why they did these things, it doesn't explain that and it doesn't explain where they got the knowledge from. It explains how they did it and how they did it was, it was certainly, it took a long time. It certainly was incredibly difficult and certainly required master craftsmen and builders and skillful labor. But the knowledge to construct it is, which really fascinating because that is what Graham Hancock points to is that is not that he doesn't believe that this was a like aliens came down and gave people information like the ancient aliens guys do.

Speaker 1:          02:05:24       What he believes is what's bad backed by real evidence. And that evidence is that there was a very sophisticated culture that existed all over the world, somewhere around 10,000 BC. And that's something probably happened to those people. And we had to start a lot of things over again. And coincidentally this time period that Graham Hancock points too, which is about 10,000 plus BC, is the exact same time period that the most recent discoveries of glass impact glass from meteor showers has been discovered at the same layer of dirt all over the world. So scientists are absolutely convinced, and this is fairly recently, that there was incredibly destructive meteor showers around 12,000 years ago and they found these in France. They found this glass in the Middle East and when they do soil samples, it's all on the same, I believe it's called the same Strada. I think that's how they describe it.

Speaker 1:          02:06:24       The same area where they know, you know, they're the way to do the calculation stuff, how, how old it is. And when they do a carbon testing on that area and they believe that somewhere 12,000 years ago, that's when the ending the, and the ice age ended. That's when all this mass extinction, it's all around the same time of woolly mammoths and Saber Tooth Tigers. It's all on the same sort of area. Um, and they could all be v could all coincide. So what we have in ancient Egypt is not simply an amazing culture that in 2,500 BC built the pyramids. It might very well be that 10,000 BC they built the Sphinx and 10,000 BC, they had massive stone structures already in place. Back when we thought that people were just hunter gatherers. That's this, that's the basis of Graham Hancock's thoughts on it. And every day he's being proven correct.

Speaker 1:          02:07:16       The more people discover about ancient civilizations, the more Graham Hancock is correct. We have a, sure we were an all of the amazing, just a lovely human being to just a great guy, you know, just exudes it, you know, he's like the perfect representative in my opinion of what can be accomplished through psychedelics and thinking and, and, and just his, his take on his own work and his take on, you know, the, the, the, the difficulty in trying to express these very controversial ideas. It's amazing to be honest, I don't know if you've watched the show with us, but he talked about the 24 years that he was smoke cannabis and how the Iowasca told him and he just dropped that right on us and the episode and just like, man, I have a lot of respect for someone who can just be that honest about themselves.

Speaker 1:          02:08:05       That's the kind of guy you want running your country men. I just, yeah, he's no longer a writer or an archeologist. He was like a, it was a great match. Mine is a great man and he changed the way I looked at history. That book fingerprints of the Gods changed the way I look at history and I'm pretty convinced now, especially due to the most recent geological evidence and to discoveries of things like to go Beckley Tempe, which is this 14,000 year old massive compound of huge nine foot tall stone columns. This is really an excuse. It's a 19 I think it might be 19 foot tall stone columns, but what it is still amazing because 14,000 years ago people were supposed to be hunter gathering. It wasn't supposed to be any sort of civilization like this. We're supposed to live in fucking teepees and Shit, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:08:50       Then he's showing that there's these huge stone structures by the way, which they've only uncovered less than 4% of I believe, because it's a painstaking process of uncovering because you know they've got to do it with toothbrushes and shit. They've got a sift through the sand and find bone fragments and pottery fragments and things along those lines. But what they do know about gold Beckley Tempe is that it was covered up 14,000 years ago. Covered up, purposely covered up. They literally buried a whole fucking city, 14,000 originally made intentionally. They did intentionally. They know they did because the type of landfill that they use, the type they used a type of, they filled in the area. They're convinced of this. They've, you know, I don't know how they can figure that out, but they were pretty much in agreement go to those sites. I mean, you don't want to go to the pyramids.

Speaker 1:          02:09:41       And Chuck been to teaching Eatsa. That's the only place I've ever been to South America. Mexico, Mexico. Yeah. It's near Cancun. Fucking amazing man. It's amazing. It's incredible. It's feels, feels different when you're there. You can feel there's something about it Reiki beyond freaky. Just to think that you're walking in this area. And as I'm looking around, I remember she was standing there, um, and just thinking that at one point in time this was like, this was a football field and they were playing that crazy game where they kick this ball through a hole which devolve to, uh, they believe that they might have played it with human heads at one point in time. And just the one area where they have, uh, the sacrificial altar where they would kill someone and cut their heart out and throw the heart down the stairs. I mean, they had it, you could go there, you could touch that altar, you could walk up this stone staircase.

Speaker 1:          02:10:31       There's a few really negative when you're like, feels, it's like they, these guys went dark. Hancock's new book is about as new fictional pieces about that whole period. And he said, oh my gosh, she's talked about it on the show. And we were like, yeah, it talks about 80,000 people being slaughtered in four days for ceremonial purposes. And he was, I was just like, Oh God. I was terrified. He was actually at paypal, they slaughtered in four days. And he said, just the rivers of blood and that the human sacrifice, I guess they would fatten people up in pens for days and weeks on end in order to sacrifice for like a brand new monument and just the concept of you being, they're fattened up with your family when you know you're just going to be, have just db used to have your heart pulled out of your body and the shown and then human beings are capable of some fucked up shit.

Speaker 1:          02:11:15       And the crazy thing is it's like how did they go from the people that were so incredibly sophisticated that they built these structures that were aligned to the cosmos and when they were aligned to the directly correlate, a lot of them do with constellations. Like they understood the alignment of certain stars. They understood the prediction of lunar eclipses like a thousand years in the future. They had figured out. So they had this incredible knowledge of astronomy and they, they had figured out and recorded a lot of like really incredible shit. And yet they were killing 80,000 fucking people and a couple of days and light and dark boys go together. Right. Is that what it is? I mean is, I feel like it's, I, I've been talking about this lately on stage too, about the real problem with the nuclear bombs at the guy who pressed the button, never didn't build it, doesn't understand it, didn't create it, didn't invent nuclear explosions, didn't figure out how to split the atom, didn't construct the whole piece.

Speaker 1:          02:12:11       He does it. He's come along and presses this button, almost Oppenheimer who worked on them and it hadn't project in New Mexico. He was, had big moral dilemmas about creating the atom bomb. I mean, and he later died from cancer, I think it was from throat cancer, from being radio acted when he was working on it. But he was really troubled his whole life. Yeah. Well do you remember what he said? He said when they tested the first nuclear bomb, the very first explosion he quoted the Bhagavad Gita said, I am, I am become death destroyer of worlds. So he said like at the first, cause he knew what he had done. He's like, Oh shit, he's got up some since calm one. Could it just slacked off for probably a few nights of work and not created it? Well, see the thing who, the people who can create it would not be the people who created it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:58       The people who can create it with a few people that go, you know, if you, if you just understand how atoms work, if you've got in there and split this and did this and that, you could do, you shouldn't do it, but if you did, well you could do is to puck and have the incredible destructive power. Don't do it. But if you wanted to do it, that's what you would do. It's like the warrior or the the general, the military man who would drop a fucking atomic bomb on a building on a city is way too fucking stupid to ever figure out how to make that thing. It's like the mentality to figure out how to make an atomic is completely different than the fatality that you would just drop one out of a plane that's a different job. If he had a nuclear bomb, would would launch it on Israel or do you think even augmented, God knows, I don't want to be the guy that does this disruptive.

Speaker 1:          02:13:43       I think. I think that when you have nuclear power or any sort of mass destructive power, it's a lot like the military equivalent of winning the lottery. You didn't really earn that. You just have it. You just have it and you're going to spend it and you, you're going to spend it with no regard. You're going to spend it and not knowing the consequences. You're, you're, you're a child with a grownup toy. You, you haven't developed this thing. You've just, you've just got access to it the same way. Some asshole who doesn't really understand cars can somehow or another just go into a Chevy dealership and buy a corvette Zr one with 648 horsepower and just fucking stomp on it and slam it right into a tree. That moron should have never had access to that kind of power or never have access to that kind of ability to move so quickly with his own decision making.

Speaker 1:          02:14:36       He can decide whether or not to run the red lights and whether or not to just drive his car right into a fucking mall parking lot and smash into cars. You can, you can do anything you want when you have a a corvette, you die. But if you could choose to just drive into traffic if you're fucking crazy. There's something weird about our ability in, in contrast to what we understand or what we've earned, the power that we've earned. Like if you build a bow and Arrow, okay, if you're a tribesmen, you're out there in the woods, you build a bone hour, you craft it and you develop your aim and then you use it and you hunt and kill an animal. I mean, that is, that's fair trade. I mean, you've really like, you've earned all of those steps. You've vasculature and all of those, but if you drop a nuclear bomb in a lake and then start pulling out fish, we've got all the fish we need.

Speaker 1:          02:15:28       You know, you're just some fucking asshole when the nuclear bomb like you, you, you can't build one of those on your own. On a similar note, like that's why, um, I've been told the best, the best, uh, war leaders are the best. Generals are the ones who've come up through the ranks because they've seen combat. They know what it means to send people onto a battlefield. Where's the guy who just went to west point and never fired a shot in his life? It's easy for him to say like, send in the troops because he doesn't know the direct consequences of that. Right. I think that's one of the reasons why they like people that get into office that aren't like Wesley Clark or like John Mccain, people that, that, you know, essentially their chicken hawks, guys like George Bush, guys like Dick Cheney, the ones who are the biggest warmongers. So the ones who never experienced it personally, you know, I think a guy like John Mccain would be far more reluctant to use a military strategy knowing that there's boys out there that it could, it could have been just like him, you know, a guy like a guy like Wesley Clark was Cerner certainly be far more reluctant to take, uh, you

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       know, the lives of these young soldiers for granted because at one point in time that was him. Colin Powell was really good about that in the first Iraqi invasion because he had spent so long in Vietnam and he'd seen the mission creep there and like have it lasted forever and ever and he was really adamant. It's just, let's go in and get the hell out. What's mission creep, Brian? It's when you don't have a defined, uh, outcome of a mission, you were not like, we're going to go in and do x, y, and zed. We're going to go in and wait until there's peace or we're going to defeat terrorism. And it's like there's no, there's no specific, uh, and to that, to that mission that's happening in Afghanistan, it's happened in Iraq and yeah. Yeah. That's the idea that we're slowly and, you know, empowering our basis out there and building up.

Speaker 5:          02:17:09       And that's what we're doing right now with Iran. You know, what we're doing with Iran, those are slowly moving battleships into that area. And you know, it's, it's getting pretty scary events. A crazy unique case. There's a website I want you to check out some time called strapped for.com STI, e t, f, O, r. And they're really big into this thing called geopolitics, which is basically every nation is built on kind of their geography as well. And they just talk about how it racks built up in a very mountainous way. And it's in no one's interest to go in there cause it's such a mess to do that. And I hope we don't anyways cause we don't really have any business doing that. Uh, no. Sorry. Ran. Yeah, of course I ran. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. We don't have business doing it. It's nuts. They certainly shouldn't develop nuclear arms.

Speaker 5:          02:17:46       Who knows if they even are, who knows what they're even, they even are trying, you know, it, it, I, I assume they probably are, but it could be propaganda. It could be just one of those things where we just need that, that area, that path to bring our oil through. You know? And that's what, that's what supposedly what this whole fucking thing is about. And it's a great Trump card. I mean North Korea has used this threat of a nuclear device to keep them alive for like 20 years and they keep bargaining. They're like, we're going to bargain this month. And then they don't. And but it's kept him kind of relevant just having this one weapon. So I think that's why countries want it. The whole world's a mess. I mean it's a bit frustrating and we've more podcasts. Yeah, well believe it or not, that sounds stupid, right?

Speaker 5:          02:18:28       Like boy, how grandiose are way we think we're going to change the world. The only way you can change the world is to influence young people so that the young people go through the ranks, don't imitate all the crusty old fuck heads that had been running things and these archaic ways because that's just the way things always were done and communication is super important. Communication and access to information. It was, this is a different world. This is not a world where you can bullshit people quite as easily. Like if your idea is we're going to the Iranian public and they listen to your podcast and similarly maybe if there was a crazy uranium podcasts and we could listen to their leaders, I just think communicating would get us at least in the right direction. Well, I bet my podcast does reach a lot of our rains and I bet there's a lot of Iranians who have their own podcast just like London Real, you know? I think I got to assume that, that this is not going to stop here. This well. I think what's going on with podcasts and with, especially with the, just the free ability to distribute information and to communicate, not even distribute information, but just even a talk on

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       the Internet to discuss things, to do review things. It's never existed like this before. There's never been a time in human history where a guy could be doing something like my podcast in La and you guys in London could be listening to it when you're going jogging. I mean with her, where the fuck is that better part emails from people in Denmark then we Taiwan to, yeah, and it's five years ago we could have done that. It's cheap. It's not hard to do. It's not like we had to spend billions of dollars and put satellites in orbit and figured out how to, you know, figure out how to get our message to people and goes over on a fucking horseback and you know, you gotta, you gotta decipher it. You gotta hire a local guy who speaks to the Lang. No, it's, it's, it's fucking easy as shit, man.

Speaker 1:          02:20:08       It's really easy and this is not going to change. I think that, I know what the crazy thing is, is the Internet was originally the Department of Defense Project and now it's going to, it's going to bite them in the air, but it's not, it's still, we need them still. We just don't need them as a daddy. Okay. No Man needs another man. As a fucking Daddy, you know, what we need is camaraderie and we need community. We need the government to rethink what they really are. They are one of us there. We're all in this together. It's not like the Stanford prison studies where they, you know, took college kids and they had, some of them become guards and someone become prisoners and he immediately see corruption and abuse. It doesn't have to be prisoners and guards. It shouldn't be, but that's what it is. We have a government that's set up that's not a part of our community.

Speaker 1:          02:20:58       That's not one of us. We have instead people that are trying to tell us what to do or the or, we'll lock you up and they suck at what they do. They suck. They're incompetent and they're shitty at their job. So they like to hide. They'll like to hide information. They'd like to make it really hard for you to get ahold of anything that shows that they suck at their job and when you bust them suck at their job and you need to distribute that information, you become an enemy of the state. Like wikileaks. I mean stop and think about what we cause has done. Wiki leaks in releasing that collateral murder video. Let people know how calloused war can make regular good Americans and turn soldiers into people that don't care. Don't care that innocent people got gunned down in the street and that make jokes and talk lightly about machine gunning vans filled with people, including children.

Speaker 1:          02:21:46       I mean this is, this is fact. You watch that video, it makes you feel bad for the guys who are shooting. It makes you feel bad for the people on the ground. The whole thing makes you feel bad because the whole thing is just off. It's just wrong and crazy and not what we want. When we think about the United States of America in a proud way, we think of ourselves as being the, you know, a noble country, a country filled with people that uh, are rugged individual is that figured out a way to escape from the monarchy of England and come over here and do it on our own. And this time we're going to have freedom and we're going to, we're going to have the constitution and we're going to make sure that we have rules in place so

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       the corruption can, and then you see just massive amounts of corruption. Where there 40, 50 years ago, I mean, we had a guest, well, we had the, okay, I guess we had a guest on two weeks ago and we talked about Islam. He's a Muslim guy who lives in Britain. He's from Pakistan, and he was like, Brian, when I grew up in the early eighties late seventies I was like, we had all these wonderful ideas of what the u s it was something good. Maybe we were also anti-soviet at the time, I don't know, also didn't have the Internet. That's a big part of it that we didn't know. No one knew about it, didn't know what we were doing. Operation Northwoods man, that was in the 1960s in the 1960s they were going to blow up airplanes and they were going to throw a bombs and attack a Guantanamo Bay and they were going to blame it on Cubans.

Speaker 5:          02:23:06       So we'd go to war with Cuba and that's a, that's a fact. The freedom of Information Act has released all the documents. It wasn't a pipe dream. It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but do we have a less favorable view globally now American than say 30 years ago? Yes, because of the Internet and because of the Iraq war, the Iraq war and Afghanistan and the subsequent damage. And then of course in other countries with the drone attacks, you know, and look, I don't know how much of a threat alcaide it is. I don't understand. I'm not, I'm not privy to that information. They don't let us, you know, we're not a, we don't get access to Todd. I don't know how many different attacks on America they've, they've caught it at a second successful attack since nine 11 which is crazy. It's crazy. But it's also crazy that anybody wants to attack us in the first place.

Speaker 5:          02:23:50       Why they met and would George Bush the only nonsense we ever got us, they hate our freedom. And you're like, you motherfucker. That's it. That doesn't a, it doesn't. I always wonder if America as a sovereign entity, if it was actually attacked, which has never really been on its own soil except for nine 11 but that was okay to building. All right, Hawaii. All right guys, you're killing me. What everyone von together or is that you said earlier, is it a nation that's not, that's fragmented. I mean, if the way is Louisiana got attack would be la people feel like, well fuck you guys. Or would you get drafted and sign your kids up to go and die to defend those borders? Well, after nine 11 what happened here was everywhere you go you would see flags, American flags, like within the first couple months after nine 11 everyone's car had a flag on Manhattan too.

Speaker 5:          02:24:35       I was there. It was nuts, man. Especially in New York where everyone's an asshole. Yeah. Can you talk about it? Cause it's the one place where people are just, but they were friendly all of a sudden. Weird in a creepy way. It was weird. It was real weird. I remember going to New York, we went maybe a year after September 11th and it was still like reverberating. It was the ripples and aftershocks of nine 11 people were way nicer than they'd ever been before. Way more friendly way, way more humble, way more respectful for law enforcement and firefighters. They were really respectful, but it's not human. Fred on the global scale for us to pull together as a species. You know, maybe an asteroid does need to hit the earth and a quarter of the population has to die so we all go fuck and hell, we need each other. We got to stop being con through each other. It's unfortunate that in this model of civilization it doesn't like there's any other

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       way for us to learn other than shit falling apart. It's not like we can just look at things and say, hey listen, obviously we're doing this wrong and we're going to have to figure out how to do it right and one in the process of figuring out how to do things right. There's a lot of shit that's going to go away and one of the things is people who have billions of dollars, you're not going to have billions of dollars anymore because it's not, your money is nonsense. Okay? Your money is basically a bunch of fucking things that are in a bank somewhere. And instead what we got to seek to do is we've got to seek to have a resource based economy, a real resource based economy. Then we've got to figure out who owns these resources and how should these resources really be distributed. Sued should shump somebody be able to camp in front of a diamond hole in the earth and say, this is my fucking hall.

Speaker 1:          02:26:07       These are mine diamonds. It's like Jeremy Frescoes long lost son. Do you really own those diamonds? Do you really own that gold really owned that oil? Well like who's who's to say that these resources or yours, should it not be that the resources are what powers our economy? Should it not be that the resources instead or what powers our government and that no one really owns them. And then they're distributed to all the people that claim the earth as their home. And that sounds co Raisie hippie nonsense socialist. But the reality is you shouldn't be able to fucking build a giant machine and park at 10 miles off Louisiana in the middle of the ocean and just suck billions of dollars out of the earth and then not give any of that back and then say, this is ours. We'd get all it was sucking all your, you're draining the earth like a giant mosquito bat vampire though.

Speaker 1:          02:27:01       Accountability when you put it that not only know con accountability, you're making money off the earth, billions of dollars and you're making it off the earth in international waters or you're making it a national waters. Are you making it in a bay or who the fuck is, why is that yours? Like what's yours? Cause you, you, you got a contract to build this giant sucking machine and where's that money going? That's a lot of money. You can control a lot of shit with that money. You're making billions and billions and billions of dollars off of oil money, man. You know what kind of fucking power you have to by lobbyists. You know what kind of pal you have to influence legislative law legislation. You'd have a lot of fucking power. Imagine if you get could zero out all the bank accounts in the world. I look, that seems white glove at the end.

Speaker 1:          02:27:44       When we had the financial crisis in London in 2008 apparently RBS, one of the banks have Royal Bank of Scotland. They were one day away from shutting off the ATM machines and they were seriously, if you've ever thought of a food riot, if you can think of people not being able to touch their money. Oh my God. Really? It was just, yeah. I mean, wow. Be some man. Yeah, that would be some mayhem. And you know, it's happened in little small doses with the collapse of us in, in America. It's happened a bunch of, there's a savings and loan collapse that George Bush's son was involved in. That was a huge scandal that, you know, cost people millions and millions of dollars. A lot of people's personal fortunes were completely erased their life. Vinnie Paz, the ends of the boxer, he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, just gone. Disappeared. Sorry. We don't have it anymore. You know, and that's, that's what a part of this financial bailout was in this, in this country.

Speaker 1:          02:28:34       The most recent one was trying to avoid something like that happening with all these big banks failing. But at the end of the day, if you're going to have a society that is well designed, you can't use an infrastructure that is not well designed and maintain it. The, the, the, the, the, the structure that we have now is so fucked up and corrupt and crazy and the crux is starting to show is a real big cats. It's like having a giant building made out of cardboard instead of just acknowledging it. You just throwing duct tape up everywhere. It starts to separate you. We've got to figure out a way for it to, to be a society that makes sense and the way that that's going to happen. The only way that's going to happen is you got to restructure finance. You've got to restructure what money really is. You've got to restructure how much money and how much, uh, how much people get paid to do certain jobs.

Speaker 1:          02:29:30       Because like most people are fucking slaves. They are just slaves with uh, the Gov a loose Coloradan they're slaves because of, and you know, by the way, that's your choice. You can not do that and you can, I agree with all that. You know, you can not be burdened by, you know, a home and mortgage and finances and, and you know, a car payments and all that stuff. But you know, what would really be better? How about if you do actually work all day? You get paid enough so that you could save money and you don't have to worry about shit. You get paid enough so that you don't have to worry about being constantly in debt. The idea of owning a house shouldn't be out of someone's reach should be fairly fucking acquirable. That would make a lot more sense. We just live in this really corrupt system of loans and interest and just nonsense number shuffling and can tell you this.

Speaker 1:          02:30:28       I just don't know how we're going to get there without blood everywhere. You're right. That's it. I don't know either or massive enlightenment and that massive enlightenment. Look. Something happened for sure during the 60s and a lot of people attributed to psychedelic drugs and the music change. The culture change. The society changed the doors recently. Yeah, that's, that's a big leap from buddy Holly. Man, some big leaps. Something happened that was a media form back then. I was telling nick today, how do you spread a message without the Internet? You do it over music and he listened to Morris and his lyrics and you're like changed kids. It changed kids. That's one of the big things. I guess the closest thing to Joe, back in the day in the sixties and seventies you know that black Sabbath's on war pigs. Oh, rip van. Can you pull it up?

Speaker 1:          02:31:14       We had just a message through the, through the music, but you're always talking about that. Get the kids to change first. Is that your only everybody, man. Everybody that I talked to that comes up to me and says, dude, this podcast has changed my life. He changed the way I look at things, change the way I approached my life. I realized that this, this is not a permanent experience. This is supposed to be a ride and an enjoyable time, a finite time that I can manage, and if I just stick to a certain amount of principles, a certain series of principles, rather go towards what you love, actually do what you want to do, be nice to people and have a close knit circle of friends. Love them as if you love yourself. To true, to really move in that direction is possible for all of us.

Speaker 1:          02:31:54       And that's, that's the way you change the world, the way it changed the world. As you change the way people look at things so that the, nobody wants to be the the big content charge because the big content charge leaves a shit life. You know these guys, look, we live in a world where when kids get crazy and they make a lot of noise in there, they're fucking hard to deal with. People give these kids antidepressants, they give them Ritalin, they give them, you know, all kinds of different crazy shit. Then when they get to be adults, then they're even more fucked up and sad and disconnected with their shitty lives. So then we give them antidepressants. We give them more things to help them get over this little mental hump. Then there dick stops working. What did they do? Well we come up, we got to Cialis and Viagra and Levitra and all sorts of pills that make your dick hard.

Speaker 1:          02:32:41       Well you know, we'll dumb fucking this, this stuff. This isn't helping me anymore. Oh we got some other stuff that you add on to your antidepressant. You take this as well as that and this is really going to put you over the top and that's really gonna make you happy. And we constantly keep looking for some sort of a chemical fix for, for, for depression and for, for the lack of good feelings in this life. And I think that there's certainly people that have mental imbalances and they are helped by pharmaceutical drugs, by antidepressants. But that not withstanding, there is also people that are getting a very bad signal from their life because they're living a life that is non harmonious. It's not fun, it's not filled with love and joy. They're not pursuing their true interests. And everybody's interest is fucking different. And our natural state is to be joyful and calm and happy.

Speaker 1:          02:33:35       And if you look at those, all those stories of when people in common to most indigenous cultures, everyone's cool. Yeah. You know what I mean? It was also people that love to be depressed. Okay. And these people that revel in depression take pride in depression. Unfortunately, people that have criticized me for talking about depression, even in my own message board, some fucking dummies wrote some stupid shit. It was so sad. It's so poorly thought out. Listening. Does anybody get furious when you know, you hear Joe talk about depression because if you understand, you don't think I've been depressed before, stupid. Everybody has been depressed. People don't know that. You have always a positive. Yeah. Well that it took a long time to get positive. I've had a really awkward social moment, really dark moments of terrible feeling and that lasted months, months. We will all have.

Speaker 1:          02:34:19       Was there anything in particular that got you through it? Um, just that helps certainly. But then that can be a source of even more depression. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me about it. To a hold of a bad one. What do you tell? Because people are always asking you for answers. I know you don't want to be the guy. You're like, I'm not the guy trying to talk. You tell you what I've learned to help people. You know, you can never tell people what to do, but you can tell people what helped you, you know? And you could tell people what has aided you and where you were going wrong and how you saw it and corrected it. So a big part of life is, is got to be the way you interact with human beings. The happiness that you derived from friendships, the happiness that you derive from doing things together from, and also from creating things, you know, and the happiness that whether it's creating carpentry or art or we are some weird animal that constantly seeks to use the imagination to make physical things manifest themselves.

Speaker 1:          02:35:14       You know, whether it's physical things in terms of some things you can read online or something that you could watch as an a video podcast, whatever it is. We have this massive amount of satisfaction that we get out of making things cause we're some weird fucking be thing where some weird insects and making a hive. We're just making this super complicated hive. It's connected by billions and billions of other little fucking weird pink monkeys and we, or brown monkeys and black monkeys and yellow monkeys and we're all putting it all together and we don't know what it is. We don't, we, we all are responsible for our own little piece of this crazy machine called culture and civilization. We don't know what the fuck we're doing, but clearly we're all working together and some weird form and you can accept that and you can, you can choose to be depressed.

Speaker 1:          02:36:02       You can choose to, you can choose to live a, an ineffective, inefficient, non harmonious life because it's gonna make your mother-in-law happy and, and keep your marriage together. Or you can, you know, seek silence and calmness and truly examine your situation and then slowly try to turn that boat around. Slowly tried to turn that battleship towards where it needs to go. I think Ari Shaffir said one time, he said, start with the people in your daily life. He's like, be nice to the waiter and be nice to this person. And you know, it's, it can be started really simple. That's my shit. Drop, drop happiness bombs, Dan, I'm gonna Start doing this. You can do it. It helps life. It puts forth more positive energy and that sounds like Hippie dippie bullshit. But it puts forth better feelings. You feel better about the day. And I think when you feel better about the day you, you think better about the future, you think you, you, you respond better to other people.

Speaker 1:          02:36:59       You set this ball in motion. And when you make someone feel better than they make someone else feel better, like you know, if rscs me tip people or be nice and then he says, know I'm going to fucking do that too. And then you hear about that and you say, I'm going to do that too. And when, when that happens and someone hearing this is, that's how I'm going to do that is just ripples and ripples of positive reactions or can raise our collective consciousness ultimately as much if not more than anything that's ever existed in human history. The biggest bursts of change that I've ever come forth in human history are nothing compared to the reactions that people are going to get to. The free access of information and content that the Internet has. The the, the impact of the 60s ain't shit compared to the impacts of the two thousands and the 2000 tens and twenties there.

Speaker 1:          02:37:43       It's going to be log rhythmically expanding. We can't even wrap our heads around where it's going and that's why the government is panicking. That's why they're building this giant NSA spy fucking cabin in Utah, one of the biggest, most expensive projects that governments ever undertaken. No money for Neil degrasse Tyson's gigantic telescope to see the beginning of time, but they've got plenty of money to build such a switch yourself holding to store every fucking email you've ever written to to take everybody's I a laptop fucking camera and turn it on to watch you beating off and store it and put it in some fucking database somewhere and you think that's a joke, but it's not. It's true. Your fucking cell phone is basically a giant gps tracking device. That's all it is. It's scary. You know, before I forget, I just want to offer up London real studios for you guys.

Speaker 1:          02:38:36       If you're ever in town to you know, use as you as your studios if you want. You guys want to like that would be dope. If wherever in England for a UFC, that's when I usually come over. I mean, obviously it would love you guys on the show, but if you ever want to just use the studios and I'm wrecking, you might be able get the queen on your show or you guys got, maybe you can get some crazy people that are in England or in Europe or Terry or one of those dudes. Is that a prince or is that one of the ugly warts? These are guys, he's a real one. I never know who's, uh, who's from Melinda's a trippy place man is what does that show? What's the movie again? Harry Potter. Potter. I never know if it's from Harry Potter or real. He's real, but a red band shirt.

Speaker 1:          02:39:11       It says keep calm and carry on, on his, on the front of his shirt. And that's like, that pretty much says a lot about Britain, you know. I mean, nick and I were, were actually foreigners, which is crazy. And we started a show called London real, I mean, I'm American, he's South African. So what brought you guys to England? I went for Bizzo and 10 years ago financing. What'd you go for? Your, I wanted to train Jujitsu. I'm under it like someone high level so instead of Roger. Right. Nice. So you, when you moved to England for hydro, Gracie, hydro, Roger, some people call high some on the show and he said either these guys, the Brazilians Guy, they all say Hodra. Yeah. You know, he's a scary guy but he's got the perfect Jujitsu body to those long limbs. You know, he's a big tall dude. I was surprised when he came over. I was like, I forgot how tall were you shocked when he got knocked out by King Mo? Yeah, I asked him about it on the show. Uh, but I was surprised. But then again, like you said, on any, on any day and chemos got some power. That's what's scary about wrestlers to, if a wrestler, a develops knockout power, the odds of you getting him down. It's Kinda small. You know, it's real. It's going to be hard to get a wrestler down Jujitsu

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       guys versus wrestlers. Always a weird sort of a, a combination. Because if the Jujitsu guy can't get the wrestler down and the rest of the guys like a chocolate Dell guy, it's bad for the Jujitsu Guy, you know? But if the Jujitsu guy can get the wrestler guy down, a lot of times wrestlers have some bad habits off their background. It's good. Yeah, it's a, it's, it's, it's interesting but that that king mo fight shows you like a wrestler with some serious power like King Mo. That's a dangerous guy. It's a dangerous guy to fight if you're trying to take the fight to the ground. It's weird. I asked Roger Wise in London, cause he's a Brazilian guy, you think it's the last place he'd want to go right to the land of rain and they say bad food. Lend it has some good food, man. We just got to eat food.

Speaker 5:          02:40:52       I don't know where to go. It was like an old bill Hicks joke. You don't boil pizza. Hold bit about money. Food being bad. I'm like, you're crazy. The Indian food, they're sensational. We've had some great, great Chinese food there. Do you guys think that you got to London? What does it feel like? Weird or, I love it. I love London. I love the people. I think they're there. I think there's so much competitive craziness in America and there's so much arrogance in the American attitude, which is, you know, one of the things that built the country sort of built, yeah. Made it, it's fucking nutty as it is, but it also makes it just exhausting. I know the bit just landing here from London, it was like I was on Mars and I walking around. I'm seeing in Venice beach and there is like a little bit of an aggression levels.

Speaker 5:          02:41:34       What's not done everywhere. We were in North Carolina, we were in Asheville this past weekend, uh, and a Raleigh, Raleigh, Friday in Asheville, a Saturday. And Asheville is a goddamn gem of a town. It's just small town and I, and everybody's walking on the streets and you know, we didn't even think about it. Like, where is this restaurant three blocks up and to the right and we're all just walking and everybody else is walking. People walk everywhere. And I'd be like that that's missing in San Fran. In La, it's completely missing in La. Nobody walks anywhere you need to have face to face contact the the tube in London, which is the underground, you see people face to face, you know, and you, you, you're constantly interacting with them, seeing these crazy women wearing burkas or some lady from Somalia and you're smelling them and seeing them and people just no more polite there too.

Speaker 5:          02:42:20       It's almost super polite. And Mackie you say, sorry first. I mean I have there 10 years now and like the first thing he say, sorry, it's really annoying when you're here. Oh, it's not, it's beautiful. It's just, you know, it's, it's setting forth good intentions right away. The theory that if you look at a place that's America's such a huge landmass that it's not ever that densely populated. If you compare it to like Tokyo or London where we were on this tiny little island. And what happens is in places like that where it's so densely populated, people are forced to be, they're forced to learn to be able to live on top of each other. And be nicer to each other because there's nowhere out. There's no way to run. I would agree with you. Except for New York. New York is filled with clients and the stacked on top of these curl and shit like chimpanzees.

Speaker 5:          02:43:01       I lived there for a few years and now it's too much for me. It's um, it's not, it's, I hear what you're saying, but no, I think it has to do with why people came here in the first place. The ripples, the first ripples of intention of the people that landed, they were crazy. They were people who were so bold. They got on a boat and sailed for months across the fucking ocean is someplace, they hadn't even seen a video because video wasn't invented. They were low CSTARS warning. 10 minute warning by London I find is that there, there are years behind the technology curve. Like I know in La, so many people have podcasts and maybe in New York's probably lagged a couple of years, but in London, I mean we totally about London real and it's like, it's a podcast and they'll be like, it's a what? There's just not a lot of people there yet.

Speaker 5:          02:43:45       That's interesting. But I think that'll change. Let me just talk. You don't have access to computers and an Internet connection microphones or you could always buy them. You know you guys will lead the way, you know you'll be the ones and it's new. That started out and at first she showed people, okay we have a show for an hour and then they try to watch it like game of Thrones for an hour. I was like, oh it's not like that. Well you know we have a lot of people who do live shows here and I don't like those. They do them in front of audiences. Marin, Marin does that for an audience. I just turn it off cause it always feels like it's different. Why are they trying to cater to the audience and they're not talking to me. They're faking on a ham it up a little and you are aware.

Speaker 5:          02:44:20       I no doubt that 50,000 fucking whatever it is and isn't in the audience. You know, I guys have done them with thousands of people I know to Corolla does like thousand seats. You know, it's crazy. I just thought it was not my thing, man. I don't think we thought it's not the right sort of a vibe. I think for podcasts it's a different thing. Some people are good Norton's great at it, nor atlas. Really good at doing. He like turns it up, you know? Do you think we should go live because we don't have a live format but it's effectively live cause we don't edit in his one hour. But I was curious. I mean you guys do have live as you do whatever the fuck you want, man. It doesn't matter. I said, I love it, but I hate it. I hated it. You hate it.

Speaker 5:          02:44:57       You still hate it. No, no, no. He's not saying in front of an audience. He's saying, Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, a lot. Well, it's a pretty authentic, everything we've said in this is, it's been live for already been knows who, how many fucking people, how many people are listening to this from Brian? Come on, you know, how do you know the numbers? How many people do watch your show all together? We don't know. Millions y'all. It's way. It's definitely millions on Sirius radio right now. We have 2100. Yeah. I mean like I'm just, our Ustream page has 11 million, 454,000 views. Just, just start page and way more. Like, like he said, there's only like 2000 people watching at a time the most. I think earlier it was probably close to 3000 the most we've ever had. Like maybe nine or 10,000 at once watching it. Yeah. But the, the, the real numbers or an audible downloads, audio downloads, MP, three downloads, right. That's where it gets crazy. Can we drop our info to come check us out? All right. We're um, the website's a London real. Dot TV. Uh, we're on Twitter at London Real TV and you can always check out our youtube channel, which is London. Real TV is a channel or just tied London real into Google man. You'll find us. And also guys that have a Jujitsu site called Jujitsu Brotherhood.

Speaker 6:          02:46:10       That's all one word. And I discussed my philosophies. It's digital brother.com just talking about my style of Jujitsu or everything's free on there. You can go check it out as well if you have a chance. Beautiful guys, if anybody wants to start a podcast in any city around the world, if you got questions, you can email a message. Just call us. Wouldn't be happy to help. I'd love to see more of these things. You don't have to call it real. You can call it whatever the fuck you want, but they end and maybe in one year from today you can be on Joe show.

Speaker 1:          02:46:35       Yeah, easily. Fuck man. I think that's what it's all about, right? I mean, I think it's all about encouraging other people to carry this on and a, you guys are doing it the perfect way. It's beautiful to watch. I enjoyed watching your show. I enjoyed listening to it, listening to your conversations with Graham Hancock and Simon and a a bunch of other ones I've seen too. It's awesome and I hope that you guys spawn a million others and it'll just, it continues on. Could have paid for it. Right? Yeah. I think that really is, it sounds so fucking corny and grandiose, but I think that really is the way to change the world. The way to change the world is to let people know how you've changed and then that just, it branches out, it ripples. It has this massive sort of snowball effect and it just grows and if there's any way that we can improve our world, it's improving the way the other people around us see it and approach it.

Speaker 1:          02:47:30       You know the Ma, this thing might be ridiculous. It might be just one frame and an infinite movie that goes on forever and that's for a lot of people that get, you know, really sad about that and say, well wow, that's so pointless like what's happening? But it's happening right now and I'm enjoying the fuck out of it. If it is happening right now, if this is really one fucking step in an infinite number of steps and it's just a a life cycle that repeats itself again and you're going to be a baby again in 50 years, guess what? I'm having a great time fuck to do this. And if I can figure out a way, cause some amount of that, transfer this energy into my next life, I'll have that. I'll have a great time in that life too. You know, I didn't always have a great time in this life and I don't know what that's from.

Speaker 1:          02:48:12       I don't know. I don't, I don't know if it's, I dunno if reincarnation is real. I don't know if this is a onetime shot and everything else is just your ego trying to protect itself from the inevitable doom of the, the, the spirit which dies just like the body does. I don't know. I don't know. We're all gonna die one day though, right? Maybe. I'm not sure that either we're all going to die. I don't even know if that's real. I'm not convinced this, this whole thing might be a fucking dream within a dream, within a dream. But the playstation said wrapped up in chocolate sauce and pumped into veins through the, through a pot cookie that Brian Red Band and you and your wearing. No cookies, no cookies, nick. But, uh, I think, uh, what's made it fun for me is to have these kinds of conversations.

Speaker 1:          02:48:54       You know, it's really made a made life more enjoyable. And, uh, I know that you guys are positively influencing a lot of people and I know, uh, this show is, and all of our friends are, and I think, uh, that's, that's what's up you, I think that's a, that's that's uh, something that we've all locked into. Most of us unexpectedly sorta stumbled into it, but that's also, I think that's the right way it's supposed to go down. You know, the universe has a plan for all of this and uh, we a little, little strange monkeys. We follow the plan and if you're, if you're resonating the right frequency, if you have the right intent, I think that plan turns out the way this one's turning now. I think it's good to helping everybody. It's awesome.
