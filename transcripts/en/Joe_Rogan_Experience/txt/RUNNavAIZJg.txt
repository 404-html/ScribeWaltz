Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I bet she would take the shoes off, throw them to the audience. I love that bag. And you put the youtube videos, black and white that day, or she'd take a gold chain strong. Rip His shirt off. I need to see this. Go Jamie. Young Jamie. Bring up law loop. A loop. A 19. I mean she was a fucking crazy bitch. She came. My mom was friends with all along, but later on I grew up with his son. We were young kids up in Spanish Harlem and I would go up there and visit them and she was crazy. They even did a one woman show watch large egg. Why looppay the queen of Latin soul. This crazy bitch. Wow. Can you. Is it okay to sit? They'll play. It could inherit. I don't want to get kicked off of Youtube. So many of us own this, right? Yeah. Stressful on her shit. Her shoes, she throws it rings. She just throws whatever is closest to a look at it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       It just gets crazy. It gets crazy. What is it about Latinos? Latinas? About Latin people? What is it about Spanish people that makes them so passionate and crazy and hot blooded? What is it? Is it genetic? Is it culture? Be Genetic. It's got to be genetic. You think so? When you get 10 Cubans together or kind of talents together, Greek, the volume goes up. We're all from the same. Something has to be something. The volume goes up automatically. Old Sicilians. The volume goes up, man. What is it? And then you have the Spanish thing that is just fucking nuts. Listen man, right out in the open right now. Say I'm as Cuban as can be. Born in Cuba. I don't mess with Cuban women. Don't mess with Spanish women. I just don't. I love him to death. You talked to a lot of Jewish people guys.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       They'll say, I love being a Jew. The whole thing. I don't mess with Jewish women. They just don't. You grew up with your mom. You know what you're going to get. You know what you're going to get. You think about your mom and we'll, we'll put up with her shit. You know your mom is Sicilian whole school. You know, it's different, man. They yell, they scream. You don't want to put up with that. My mom was pretty calm. Her mom was a yell or scream or yell or scream. Uh, if there's a problem, sweet. The saints get called once to say it's called, you got a problem. What did I do to deserve this? But, uh, no. I, I can't. Uh, it's too much. It's just too much, man. Too much passion. The shoes come on. People getting yelled at. I don't dig it. People throwing shit at each other, but you get those spicy Latina is, you know, narrow zeroed in and you get them where they're fucking savages. If you control that into sex and all that, it's fucking probably savagery. Like I said, I've been with one Spanish girl and I moved on enough that that's how good the pussy was. I got left back seventh grade back. I stopped going to karate. I stopped to church

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       and that was just dry humping and, and feeling her tits. Can you imagine if she gave me that monkey in the seventh grade? That would have been fucking walking dead. Do you remember how overwhelming it was the first time you were with a girl? Overwhelming. You'd never had any sort of feeling like that in your life and now it's just overwhelming, completely overwhelming, and then you have two sets of friends. Do you have the logical friends and then you have animal friends when you're 13, so I had friends that would go, that's nice. Where are you guys going to go to a movie and then you have the fucking heavy duty. Adam, what are you going to do?

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       Finger motion? Yeah. They're like, what are you going to do? You got to fucking grab or make out what the right number. They just tell you what to do. You're lost. You completely fucking lost when you're 13, but how great is it? The fall in love and hold hands and go to the movies and go get a slice of pizza. When I was 13, I lived in this place called Jamaica plain and it was like a at. It's becoming more gentrified now, but at the time was kind of sketchy. We had some kind of crazy neighbors when this one kid, his name is Paul Hudson, he lived right next door. Poly Hudson was my age. We were both like 13, but he was like 30. He was like a 30 year old, 13. He knew a lot of shit. And I remember one time he was talking about I hadn't, I hadn't even come close to sex.

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       I don't even know if I had kissed a girl, like maybe like a little pack or something like that at 13 Paul yachts and probably fucked 100 girls by that. I'm not kidding. It was an animal and a and he, we were talking and he goes, uh, somehow or another it got on the subject of how a penis enters the vagina, how it gets in there. And uh, and he was telling me, it goes up, you go up in a and I go, you go up in there. And he goes, you ain't never fucked a girl, have you? And I'm like, no, no, I definitely haven't. Like, I didn't want to admit it, I'm sure. But if it was fucking obvious, I didn't even know that your Dick went up. I thought it went straight in. We all do. I just found that out now and I'm 53.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       I didn't know the up and I literally thought I could never figure it out in my head because I was like, well, I kind of know where the vagina is. Like how could it work? Going straight through it. It doesn't make any sense. But that's literally what I thought. I thought you went straight in. I thought it was like a belly button, like the thoughts you have about sex or man or young woman got to be. You don't know. Yeah. You can't figure out why they do that. Yeah. Yeah. You're so confused because he didn't have any of those thoughts to three years ago. Like you're 10 and you're just thinking about comic books and you know, all this stuff. You think about when you're 10, you know, what do you like to do? You like to go fishing or something, you know, just hanging out with your friends and then all of a sudden you're 13 and your dick is hard all the time and you're so confused and when you're around girls they hug you and your follow. Your body's just overwhelmed. The smell of their hair and just being around them is so attractive. You know, like, Holy Shit is this

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       first time you sneak up behind a girl you're behind and you smell her, her harrison, your mode. You've got like a fucking anxiety attack. Like what the fuck is this? Was that close to you and touch you? And then you have the. Did you have somebody who broke sex down for, you know, like, like we had a dude in my neighborhood always at war. Taos name was Puerto Rican Nelson and he lived in the back of a thing and we go to him. It started with him fixing our bicycles and we evolved with him. So we want it from playing baseball on the street. And he would come out, he was a bartender at night. He would come out and throw balls with us. And with football, and that's the guy you go up there and you go, hey man, can we talk to you tonight?

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Because firstly introduced us to weed, right? He was like, you guys smoke weed? And we're like, Nah, we ain't have no. He sold us like seven joints for five hours. So he became a dealer and then the next level. Which girls. So we asked them, what do you know, what do we do about girls? And he would yell at us. You guys never fucked what kind of little facts on, you know, he would just fucking say a bunch of shit. And then, uh, it got to the point, we have clinics at this house. We go, can we come over tonight? Yeah, better be quick. What time? Seven 30. We come over and we'd go, Nelson, we have to take this girl out. What do we do? And he break it down, take it to the movies you pay, but then you wanted more, you know, what do we do?

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       And he's like, all right, I'll teach you about sex. Come around to my window till about 8:00. I'm going to fuck my girlfriend, I'll let you look like shit like that creepy shit. Then we actually got went over there and they listened like shit like that. And we would ask them about come like, what's come due? And he would tell us it pregnants degree. He was like a in the seventies there wasn't no sex education in schools. Doug. So you had to get it. Where the fuck you got it right. So you didn't have that in Boston? Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       I didn't have any uh, uncles that are friends like the Hudson. No, he didn't make me nervous. I tried to avoid him. He was real. He was too street for me. That kid, there was a couple of kids like that. There were two street for males or oh, that's when I really realized that I need to learn how to fight when I moved to Jamaica plain because I was super nervous skies or pick on me and I had no idea what to do. Like if anything went down, I had no idea. Like my Stepdad was never into violence. Nobody ever explained to me how to even punch or hold your hands up correctly. So cool. I got to learn something, so that's when I started getting into karate and I was into movies before that I'd taken like a Kung Fu class or something like that once when I was like maybe eight years old and I lived in San Francisco, but it really know martial arts to speak of and this neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          00:08:32       I was like, fuck, I got these kids are scaring the shit out. When was this to make a plane in New York? Now it said Boston. Well this is a suburb of Boston. Not a. not a suburb really. It was like a. it's an inner city area, but it's just at the time it was at least just kind of a poor neighborhood, but apparently now they have some nice bars and restaurants and you know, housing prices so expensive. Someone a chance on the outskirts and they start pushing those bad neighborhoods away. They start building up and own and they become gentrified and you'd get a nice house in a nice neighborhood for a good deal. So a lot of people, you know, that's a giant problem with New York right now. People just keep talking about it in Brooklyn. Brooklyn's just being bought. Really. It's, it's so expensive to live in Manhattan.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Have you ever tried to look at real estate? If you ever fantasize, maybe I'll move to New York for a couple of years. Like Arusha, fear your thought about doing something like that. I have. I thought about it. I looked at housing prices. You're like, what are you talking about? That's not $5,000,000. That's an apartment. How was that? $5 million. Do you ever yard? Is there a. is there something I'm missing? Like what the fuck? What the fuck is this? It's apartment. It's an apartment, but they're stupid expensive, like regular rent. People were talking to him about their regular rent. They were talking like $3,500. I was like, what? Like a regular comic. Like not someone who is doing great now. Like at Jim Norton or something like that. Just a. A regular comic has got a one bedroom apartment. I was like, Holy Shit, how the fuck do you pay that every time heavy to live in that city.

Speaker 2:          00:10:05       For me to afford to live in New York, had to live down the shore. What'd you do that do you think you'd go down the shore? Long Island. I would go down the shore because I'm familiar with it. Right. I would go like route 17, Marlboro around there and they got Chinese restaurants to the old school, Italian places. I'm saying it doesn't. I'm already land. Keep a place down there because we have like a. I think he's got like hoboken, hoboken. He has a house. He has a condo or an apartment in hoboken. I think he's got a place down in the shoulder. He has a place down in this show. Yeah. I still deal with a lot of gut. Bob Gunzel gigs down their apps and this feels right. This is a little away from where everybody goes. This is up from Toms River and seaside and Belmont one.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       This is Marlboro. It still takes you off the 34, 35. You still got to drive a little bit to see the ocean and shit like that. I just had a friend that lived there and I liked the neighborhood. I liked how the neighborhood was. They had an old school Italian Delis. You walk in stinky cheese, blood, saliva, all that stuff. A fucking tongue hanging upside down. Wet books with water, you know. Let me ask you this, Frankie. Edgar's got to be the king of Toms River. Fuck yeah. He's the king, right? King. That's his place. I haven't been. He made me say Tom's river on a paper view once. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's like after you once say Tom's river was like Toms River Shit. Toms river is next to seaside. Is it? Yeah, like close to seaside lava. Let, if I remember correctly, because every time I'd be in seaside I was in Tom's river.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Right, right, right. I used to go to Tom's river. What you do as you go down and you put on some nets, put those nets. Like the kids. I used to go down and we stopped by Toms River. There was a spot and you drop nuts off and then you go eat and you come back and you fucking pull out those clients, those crabs, Woo. And they would go home and make a sauce with the fucking crap. Oh, Katrina water. That's the thing, right? The, the sauce with crabs. You don't really get that out and you know, it's very tough to make. Like I don't know how to make it. I just saw them do it. I would never fucking dry because I wouldn't trust her, but they would just take the crabs and put them in a fucking hall boil the crabs and the tomato sauce sauce and they like, it has to shell breaks.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       I don't fucking know. I, they get the flavor, the meat. I'm trying to remember if they pull the meat out or if they left the clause in. Sometimes it seems like sometimes they just left the clause and everything in. Right. And you would have to get it out afterwards. You just have to suck it out after we break the. But you don't see that. So it's pretty rare with like a red sauce. You'll see it a little bit in a nice fancy Italian restaurant as a special. Somebody comes in with those crabs. You, we have some nice grabbed for you. There was a place that was a real good place that was in west La. It was a real good, especially when it opened up. It's called Il Grano and uh, I think it just went under unfortunately. But this guy, the chef as an artist man, and he made this squid ink pasta with a, with a crab sauce, like a light tomato, eat crab sauce where it was, um, I don't know which kind of car crab it was.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       Anyway, dungeness. That's what it was. Jesus Christ. It was spectacular. It was like this black ink pasta that was cooked perfect. So you chew into it. It's not mushy. Doesn't just dissolve you like it's got a little pop to it as you bite into it. And the crab with the sauce. It was fun. One of my favorite dishes. And what's the crab we get in Jersey? Excited. What's the dungeness? Isn't it? Is it dungeness? Blue Crabs and Maryland, right? Isn't that? I don't know shit about crabs and you shut the fuck up because whenever I go to Texas I get dungeness crab with the salad and his Florida, the place where they have those, uh, king king crabs or Alaska. But then there's another big one. Is that a rock crab rock? Grab the ones with the big ass fat clause. What are those? Stone crabs. Stone Crab.

Speaker 2:          00:14:09       That's right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All in Texas. I think. I'm not sure that's a get drunk sort of move. Be As. Yeah, he eat those things and you drink a shitload of peers and your uncle gets drunk and stupid shit and wound up getting out of there. But it's crazy because as a child I could eat lobster. I could eat any fish. Fucking squid ink. The one I could not eat was crap growing up. Why not sick? Right off the bat. I don't know why. And somebody said it had something that crab has something that make you sick. I didn't start eating crab or maybe 15 years ago I couldn't eat a crap. I liked the sauce. I could take the sauce but. But it had a skit. I

Speaker 3:          00:14:51       had died, I had done, I had done. Somebody said that's what it is. It's heavy and I had died. I don't know if it's true. I don't fucking know what's in food. And I put for years I couldn't eat it. I started eating crab again Tuesday nights at Meogie when we used to do comedy there and they used to lip sync in there and shit when they had one little stone crab rolls and I didn't get sick. So I started eating it again. Wow. For years I get sick off grab every time. Anything else could go down, crabs, clams, whatever. I just went to Boston and I went to legal seafoods and I got those big fucking clams every dead and 12 and Jesus, little horseradish, a little. Oh my God. Those things are fucking delicious because you get the steamers with the tails and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       You don't like those. I love those. You're making a face like it in like steam is rough when you're eating that butter, dip those and butter. It was the first day and I said whether I'm going to switch a big fucking clams cherry, Cherry net. Those are good. Those are very good. I think I prefer them over oysters. Really. The A to the oysters don't work for me. The the clams have more snap when you're. When you're eating them raw. It's interesting because we never thought about it is that being Sashimi, you know, you're just getting clams or oysters, but it's raw fish. It's raw seafood, seafood, you know what I mean? It really is. How is that any different than, you know, getting raw scallops at a Sushi place. It's kind of the same. That is a weird thing that we just cook. We cook almost everything.

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       We cook fish, but there's spots we can go where they don't cook it. It's delicious. Very good. They just give it to you raw. You go to Alaska. I've been Alaska and get the halibut up there. Like when you get the. I haven't gotten. I haven't done that where it's fresh and really raw. Two different worlds, man. Halibut. Sushi is really good. I would imagine if you got it like right off the fish, it would be amazing. Amazing. Yeah. It's weird that we have these sort of rules like as far as like food preparation and it just changed with Sushi, like think of this country up until Sushi. Like nobody. There were no one's serving raw fish anywhere until what? I mean. What year did she come out? The eighties or something. Seventies. I remember Japanese restaurants in New York said, I don't remember Sushi. Sushi.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       She blew up. I didn't try Sushi to Seattle like 95. I still away from it yet, but once I was in I was fucking all. But I definitely remember Sushi when I was a kid. I remember it from when I was like 18, 19 years old. I remember that. So it had to be before then. So man, maybe it was like the seventies. We think about it. Culinarily speaking. If you could do that, that's a long ass time with no Sushi. A long ass time in this country all those years with no Sushi. And then all of a sudden Sushi now you've been to. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       And as the Sushi different in Japan, I don't really know. I couldn't say that honestly because I went to a couple places, I didn't go to a lot of places, you know, we were only there for the UFC so it was pretty in and out. But the Sushi that we found there was like, you know, it, it was, you're in a Japanese restaurant, has a totally different feel because you're in Japan. I mean you're in Japan, the people can barely speak English if they speak English at all. The menus are all in both Japanese and English was pretty cool. And so one of the cool things about traveling, a lot of people speak English, so there's a lot, a lot of places you can go where you can at least sort of get by. They speak enough English so you can get by. And uh, that's uh, that, that's the case

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       since it's a weird thing, man. When Japan, it's like, if it's a totally different world, like when you go to Japan, like their culture is so interesting the way they choose to behave like collectively. So interesting. They're super polite. They have giant crowds of people in the streets and there's no issues. Everybody walks by each other with no problems. It's like it's. It seems like even though it's an accelerated culture and obviously they'd get a lot of shit done. They make a lot of things. It's they've giant businesses and it's a small place. If you look at how tiny it is now, many people are stacked in there, but they're super polite really. I mean, it's amazing how little crime, how much order you have and then every now and then you have these dudes have come from other countries and decided like, oh, this is an easy pickins place.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       We were there. We ran a two while we're walking into a restaurant and we ran into these African dudes trying to get you to go into these massage places now. Like super aggressive about it and you're like, Whoa, this is interesting. So you have all these polite Japanese guys and then these really slick, streetwise dudes have moved into spots and you could see them sort of work in these places, but they're in Tokyo, which is, you know, overall. It just really, really polite. It's interesting. It's really interesting. Apparently I didn't experience it, but apparently they have a rate that really, especially the older folks do not like white people. They just are not really into Americans being around. We bombed them. Oh yeah, I know. I mean, you think they gonna forgive us that quick. We don't think about that in our generation. We don't think about that. That's why they don't need Vietnam food for a long time. I'm like, we just fought them. They want to poison this. You want to go to that and a Vietnamese fucking that rolls. They just fucking poisonous. I would poison you. You know? Yeah. It's funny how the menus, like what we think Chinese. That's why I asked you, because when we think Chinese food is here is completely different over there because it gets an Americanized and the same thing goes for the Sushi. Bob Sapp told me that when we're shooting the longest yard,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       he said the Sushi was more a little primitive over there. They'll come up with a fucking octopus, you know, like shit like that where there's a lot of places that'll do that. Jimmy, I need a cup. But when, uh, when uh, you know, I was watching something on food and they were talking about a place in Japan where you go get some type. It's a place where they only serve food that has an, it's an aphrodisiac. Oni, like it's both balls and somethings I balls or something. So you go in there to get tuned up for a date. Like when you go to El Paso, Texas, okay. If you go towards the end of a Paso, Texas and get Mexican soup, like you could hand fish soup. There's a couple of heads in there with the eyeballs looking right at you that you wouldn't find that here in California and have a fucking heart attack.

Speaker 3:          00:21:38       But once you get more towards the country itself, they start showing that culture like we don't know anything about both balls. It's something to do with bolts and what, how they put it in a soup or something. It's a special of the day and the women can eat it also, but it just becomes something different. That's what I was. That's what I was asking you about the food. Well, the one place that we went to, we went to at least two Sushi places, but one place we went to, it was supposedly a great place. I think bordain might have recommended it to me name drop, but when we went in there it was just a, you know, same stuff that you get here really fresh. Really. You know, it was, it was right out of the ocean I'm sure. But that's the same thing here. We share the ocean a lot of the same fish, but the Japanese fish people, Japanese who she plays, there's only buy from Japanese fish fishing guys.

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       They keep it like my buddy sold fish back east and I used to say them. You don't feel that the Japanese people know it's well known that that market with the mafia ran a really. When you go there in the morning, you see the town and just see the white, the Irish and the Japanese people because they have different types of fish and what they do with it. I think. I'm sure they have that poisoned blowfish. What they tell you not to eat Sushi went on Mondays and some other debt because the fishers old. Oh really? They always say the fish that comes Tuesday and Thursday. That's when you get sushis. Don't eat Sushi. I'm. I don't know. I don't like someone day. How long can you keep Sushi before it's terrible. If you had to guess, if you buy a big piece of tuna, how long before you have to serve that?

Speaker 3:          00:23:14       I can't imagine. It would be very long. Very long now. Like a few days at the most. I don't trust fishing on trust pork. A lot of times you got to be careful with those two. Those two. Just a little slight McCook and you're fucking in the hospital. Not domestic pork isn't so much anymore, but it used to be for sure freezing fish for 24 hours, allowing it to thaw on the refrigerator. Reduce harmful bacteria. Making the fish safer. Oh, I see. That's interesting. So they free. Oh, this is interesting. Fish for a made for a fish, for making homemade Sushi. Should be purchased from a cmo longer,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       not a local grocery store. That's interesting. What's the seeming? See Maga is a dude who goes and buys it straight off of the boats and he only has like, he has it that day. There's a guy used to train with in revere who is a younger who would come and take taekwondo in my class and this dude had a truck and he would drive his truck to the boats and you know, negotiate a price and buy fish and then deliver that fish to restaurants. Like that was his thing. It's really interesting because we talked about it and you know, he was telling me how, what a grind it was like, Whoa, how much work is involved and what it does. I mean he just works. He was getting up early. Early. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       In the morning, the morning you put an App, would you tell them you go to like 20 restaurants and you'll listen? I have salmon. I got my Ma and I got the yellow tail. That's my fucking shit. Yeah, you pull it out, but let's say you're a column my restaurant and you sell 25 pounds a day of, you know, for. I liked my. Where I grew up. Rudy's Rudy's is basically a columbine restaurant. People go in, that's the appetizer they buy 50 pounds a day. They probably got three different guys. They go through. Wow. And Chris was one of them, you know, he was Italian and they, you know how to cook it. So he would go over to. He had a great job for years. Man, you know what happened? He got smart and that's what happened. He got smart when he kept it simple, his was very easy.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       He went to restaurants. He said this is what I have really good. And he gave him a car with a phone number. He got up at three in the morning. He pressed the machine and this is joe from Rogan's, let me get 25 pounds of column on 10 pounds, the yellow tail. So all he had to do now is add up. So he would get your 10 pounds squared is 20 pounds is 30 and Sarah, I need 100 pounds of squid. He would go down there and there's people that actually cut a deal for that. You know what? I want this a pound to 100 pounds. I'll give it to you for this. His money changed every day. It's money changes every day. So once he go to the boat by it and then they delivered it and that was it. No overhead, no real insurance, no freezers, no nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       Anything he had left over. That's what he went to come to his family to cook. What happened was he went partners with a guy got a freezer. They stocked up on the fucking food. They stocked up on the fish and New York had a power outage. He lost 60 grand. That was the end of everything. He lost 60 department, lost like 80 [inaudible]. They went on, got got bones and spent all this money on wholesale. You and I both know it's a daily thing. Yeah. That's a daily thing. You been making a living for 10 years on a daily. Now you want to think about the future and buy a bunch of fish and that's the night that like a week later the power went out. When he moves into his warehouse, he had to go there in the middle of the night and fish ice things. You got to take stuff out and ice. Him and Jesus. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       they didn't have such good insulation back then either. How long has the power for like 12 hours that time in New York. This school I'm telling you 10 years ago, you know they have coolers now that to keep things like they keep ice for seven days outside. We've seen these coolers. No, they're crazy. They're like, there's a bunch of different really high end coolers and most of it was started, at least to my knowledge by this company called Yeti and Yeti coolers. They make these outdoor cores that people use when they go camping or something like that. They're real thick and you put ice in those fucking things. You close the lid, open that lid and seven days there's going to be ice in there. It's crazy. The insulation properties of these things are nuts. I just, I don't. They have a seal like your pull down these rubber straps to seal it in. They're not cheap. They're fucking heavy shit to. They're really heavy. You know? Most coolers are really light. These things are not like you want your eyes to fucking safest days. They're crazy though. It's crazy what they can do. Like they somehow or another figure it out, some insulation method that retains cold for a long time, but they didn't have that shit in the seventies.

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       Imagine the Ice House in Pasadena used to be an ice house. Used to be a place where they would deliver ice and you would go and get a chunk of that shit for your icebox and you wouldn't have an icebox and refrigerator and that's where you keep your milk and whatever you're going to eat that day. But you went to the market every day. Feiss yeah, we went to the market for ice when maybe I use every few days, but you went to the market everyday for food. Like you don't, you just, you didn't just have like a refrigerator. You open up, pull out packages of meat packages, chicken like that. Nobody did that. This is really rare. Like when there was no refrigeration. Think about that. That's not that long ago. For most of human history. There's been no refrigeration. That's why people used to go to war for salt. Joey, they used to go to war for salt because salt was how you could keep your food fresh. You'd have to take a piece of meat and cover it with salt, cover it completely, and that would keep bacteria from growing on it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:52       That's how they took care of their meat. That's like they would salt their fish when they would go to see they, they, the salt would be so valuable. So like there was salt wars in the world for fucking salt, which is worth nothing now. Just crazy. Like if you went all in on salt back then and was like, dude, people are going to war for this shit. And then today you went to a diner and there they have little packets. You can just take them like you could take them, go to in and out Burger. There's a whole box, how can I take you? Take as many as you want. You can take as much salt as you want. What are you fucking crazy. You'd call your Viking friends. They're given salt away at the Burger place. It would just come in there and steal all the salt. Salt back then would you kill people for salt? Because that's how people like it would allow you to keep food longer, which is insane. Like that was like imagine to war for refrigerators.

Speaker 3:          00:29:43       You know Japan had the refrigerators and we didn't know there was a war to try to get refrigerators is the only way you keep. Keep your food longer. That's literally what people were doing. They were going to war for salt. When you watched the honeymooners, they drained the refrigerator. Now I figured out why it was an ice cube. She would pick the thing up and drain in. The honeymoon is and that's why they probably put an ice cube and now they close it. That's how they do what the honeymooners though was electrical, so they probably did have refrigerators, but a lot of those things would freeze up. The ice box is you'd have to defrost them. Do you remember that? Yes, they would. They would. Fucking freezer would literally be like the inside of it would be like, like a an ice cave? Yeah, like a Yeti's ice cave and a monster movie.

Speaker 3:          00:30:29       Now you have freezes. Freezes. Well they call them something that you freezers don't. Isis freezers. They don't. You don't have to defrost them. Right, but we used to chip out them with a screwdriver and fucking hit. When I was a kid, I used to use my air conditioner a year round, like my mom used to call you fucking crazy. I'd put the air conditioning in my room year round and it would get a brick of ice on it. I'd have to. Wow. That's what happens when you put it on the window. I guess the inside refreeze freeze, I'd have to turn it off and let it come down a little bit. The inside, we're fucking freeze them. Those old school heaters. That would make noise when they were starting up like clank clank, clank pills, radiator heaters, really tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. It was this hot fucking chunk of metal in your house and if you leaned on it would sear your skin like a George foreman grill and that's how you keep your house warm.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       Remember those goddamn things. Those are ridiculous metal things. Those heavy. You would pick one of those motherfuckers up. Fuck those radiators, man. Does water heaters. Hot Water would go through them and they would heat up and that's what you use to keep your house warm. Those things were ridiculous and you put a box over them and even if you sat on the box by mistake, you'd fucking burn. Yeah. And the only thing in your fucking house at all would be like within 15 feet of that thing. And they always put them under the window. Exactly. They would put the heat under the fucking window. Like I never figured that. So you'd stand there and get burned. But there was like a draft or some shit. Yeah. They didn't have anywhere else to put it. You couldn't put them in the middle of the roundabout, those metal fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       You know, you get like a house, like the last house I had it and the studio said he had no fucking heat. Why when they built that no fucking heat because they didn't think people in California, and you know those burbank houses, those old houses that didn't have heat or they put a little box like you're only gonna to use it. Let me tell you something. When you come out of the shower, you need to eat. I don't give a fuck who you are. When you come out of that shower and you turn that water off, you need to heat. That's a trick they do in Topanga. There's a lot of

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       houses, independent candidate, don't have air conditioning like you don't need it. Maybe you need one or two days. Fuck you. I don't live walk. That breeds people invite you over. Meanwhile you're fucking melting that. What's coming out of yet and like we don't have the air. We leave the windows open. It's sort of fuck you put. You should have told me this on the invite. I wouldn't have came and we have nowhere. We lived by the fucking, but I wouldn't have came. I want to add, I got to have something. You got to hit me with some. Some people like to have like a thin sheen of perspiration on them all the time. No, Shane, you got to have a little bit of add something to something. I don't want my hands to freezing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       I know what you mean man. I agree with you. One hundred percent. You know that shit works from Colorado. Like when I lived in Colorado. You Do, you leave your window open one inch and your house will fucking freeze to death in the winter. Just one inch. That shit don't happen to hear. That never happened here. I'm always fucking warm in that. These people say, well the breeze dries. You don't fucking do nothing for me. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       it's nice sometimes, but if it's 98 degrees and Dick and that happens, that happens. I mean it only happens a couple of days a year, but it happens, but it happens that day. You invite me over to the house and watch the fight to something and that's the dad go fucking ape shit. It just seems like why would you have such a big nice house and not have air conditioning? Like I've seen people's houses. They're like, this is a nice house, man. You got a great house but you don't have air conditioning. Is This A. is it a money thing? Is going environment be different and break my balls, but

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       that's what they want to do. They want to be different. I'm like, we don't live off of. And then they start making excuses for her while the something factor in their raises your cat can't. What the fuck you talk on them. I just want to be comfortable a little bit. Is a air conditioning bad for you? I've never heard of air conditioning is bad for these people will find something bad for it. There's certain people that find something, but I can't get a tattoo joe because I can't see needles, but I'll tell you that off the bat. There's people that'll say they hate that. Those why do you hate? I just hate that. You don't hate that [inaudible]. You can see fucking blood so you can't get it that though. That's why. Yay Them. I just hate needles. When I went to the doctor yesterday, she goes to me.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       Uh, all right, so I'm going to give you the steroid. I'm gonna give you this for you. He is. She goes, I'm going to give you the shot. And she goes, no, I'm not. And she goes, I remember the surgery. You're a fucking nightmare with needles and shit when it comes to all that. So they couldn't find the vein. This surgery. That's a fucking nightmare. Three plugs. That drove me. I was ready to go home. Listen, if you don't find the vein this time we go home. Really? Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm done. You poke me three fucking times. Every time I faint. Let's do the risk. Look at these fucking veins in here. Finally she found the vein in my hand. Look at that. There's veins right there. I hate all that shit. Needles. Blood. Soon as I walked into the doctor, checked my blood pressure before I walk into a doc. That could be 1:30 over 80. I walk into

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       a doctor's office. It shoots up the one 90 over fucking 1:30. Yeah. We always look at people who do drugs intravenously, like that's next level. That's next level. You're shooting it up like you're. You're opening your vein with a piece of metal and you're injecting some liquid in there. Ooh, that's deep. Like you just threw all protocol out the window. That's why you. If you ever hear about someone who's like, hey, does coke? When someone says, this guy does a lot of coke, I put them in this category kink. Someone goes, I got smokes a lot of weed and put them in that quarter. Paint. Someone goes, he shoots heroin. I go, oh, this motherfucker goes over here. This is a different role. I something that you know how much pain I had in my heart the first time I had to put something in my nose.

Speaker 3:          00:36:27       I'm just not a good feeling. It's not a good feeling. I don't give a fuck with that. I think about it now. It's horrible. You just made a big leap to being a guy who does coke the first time I put some in my nose or wasn't covered. What was it? It was angel toss. It was the crystal. It was, you know, they, they called the TAC crystal, the crystal. That's what they call it, but they didn't call thc like pot. That's what you did in those days was there was a thing that you took a bunch of stems. You got, you took a pound of the stamps, you got to pound the weed. You took those stems, you put them in a little bit of water and you boil it. The powder that goes to the end of the thing that would scrape that up, mix it with some color and then you can snort that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:10       That was the beginning. So I was okay. Okay. Some tea. See Crystal. So what does that do for you? What does it feel like? Because I feel like you had a smoke. Yeah, it feels like an adult, but they got hip and they started putting angel dust and gorilla tranquilizers. Fucking donkey. Fuck. And next thing you know you, I mean I had a great time doing that shit. I'm not gonna lie to you. I love doing that crystal shit. Yeah, loved it to. So this is the snorting, snorting or smoking slump. Essentially a edible cannabis, but it wasn't. No edible cannabis. It's totally there. It was gorilla biscuits, right? So you have two choices. You can either go down to like a place and buy for $10. You got three lines when you're 16 and 15 each line, the street hours make it. Each line were high for 12 hours.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       I'm how fucking 12 hours or eight hours of heavy duty like the last. If you had a. well it's hard to tell now because your tolerance is so high. But if you had to compare it to like an edible was, is like a 200 milligram, God, God, compared to an edible 500 million gone. God. No, no, no. It's just a different area. It's like taking something that you actually go to a different fucking around. It's not like doing an adult, but I've done some edibles and I've gone to different rums. Don't get me wrong, but first couple times you do the like, one time I went, I was working. I graduated

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       high school. This is the tail end of my tea. Have my crystal Korea. I wasn't even because I did crystal tea from. I was probably 15, maybe 14 and a half up to the point my mother died. Then cocaine took over and cocaine just said, fuck all that shit. And there was no more acid. Cocaine came in that heavy in 1980. So before 1980 you would snort. You were doing the pills and you were doing the fucking, the thc crystals and all that shit. But after the cocaine, just want it. So in 82 I graduated, I was working in the city for this book and I went over one day and they go, listen, we're not going to do the horses today. My Dad can't come if you want to hang out for the afternoon. So I said, fuck it. I'll just take the day off. I'll never forget this. I went walking, I saw some girl and I was walking into one of those spots to get reefer. I was going to get weed, my day was over and let me get weeded out and I don't have to come back tonight from Jersey and some black girl came up to me, that'd be 10 in the morning and she goes, you want to split a tray? I said, sure. A tray was at $3, bag of angel dust.

Speaker 1:          00:39:45       So you opened it up and it was just a little wine and you took it and sprinkle that on your joint. They sold the right there at the refit spot. Wow. And you would roll it and smoking. I smoked every 10 at 8:00 at night. I remember taking a bus over from being with her and going, I'm still fucked up. Like now I can talk like, you know, at the end of the day when we, because we smoked it and then we just sat there and talked to all of that and three hours. Then she told me she was pregnant. Wow. And that's what she. I got pregnant and she opened up a jacket and I could see her belly. Oh, I didn't know before that. I never forgot that. I never forgot that, but I remember going over the fucking bridge and going to a bar and going, if I'm still fucked up at 9:00 at night, whatever, and that baby like, man, that's fucking crazy. That is fucking crazy. Wow. We just went to a park and sat there and talked and read the Daily News and the fucked up whether, I don't know if we went to eat. I don't remember what we did with Sachs. Nothing like that happened. We just hung out all day. We were that fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       That's the crazy thing about being born. You can't pick your parents. That kid just got a shit roll the dice is mom's doing angel dust. Damn. Anybody that gets like loses their perspective. That's a real perspective enhancer right there. That idea, that poor kid and that poor girl that she's so fucked up, whatever happened to her, led her to become that kind of person takes angel dust while she's pregnant. Fuck man.

Speaker 3:          00:41:32       Oh, oh my God. So weird. Like we know things are bad for us, but the feeling it gives you feel so good. You want to do bad things to yourself. It's a little trick. It's like this bad thing to you. That's piggybacked on a good time. It's like it gives you a good time. It's like, I'll give you a good time. He let me poison you. How much have a good time? Oh, you got to remember a lot of fun times. I'm going to poison you though. Okay. Like, okay. Okay. Okay. Now let me. I'll get off it. Eventually you'll get off of it. You're for sure. Going to give you a good time and it just latches a hold of you and to you and your lovely poisons out there. Joe From Mcdonald's to steroids. I mean, emily, do you want me to say what the is the worst?

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       The worst right now. Cigarettes. Really? When I shot that special, I was smoking reefer outside. I didn't want to smell like refund. When I went in and there was a cop and I took a cigarette from somebody. I'm like, I light and I just took to it. Some of it [inaudible]. I felt it the next day. Really like, I'm like, this is hard. When you don't smoke for a long time and then you smoke, you're like, oh shit. Because I tell you what, Joe. Hi. I live on the deep end. From time to time I'll have a duis and ginger ale or on a flight somewhere, you know, an alcoholic drink belts and fucking run with me for 12 hours. Bro. Don't drink alcohol like everybody. A big drinker. No, but I like it. I liked the taste. The doors and Ginger Ale. I like Irish cream on the rocks.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       Whatever the fuck it is. You know, I came in before I was early and I was looking through your whiskey thing that Jack Daniels is Sinatra at. Smells fucking tremendous. Want to do a drink? Not in a million fucking years. I'll drink. Affects me completely different than it affects anybody. I drink one of those. I can't drive home. I got to sleep in here. Really? I can't. I can not drink and drive. It's against always. I always fucked me up like that. Watching. Maybe that's why you don't like booze. It's like it has a stronger effect on you. Maybe do. I don't like boosters. I grew up in a bar and saw the different, you know, you and I have a common knowledge that I talked about the ad that I'm going to point my life. I can't take drunk people, but I'm going to be honest with you.

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       I couldn't take drunk people and I was 20. I was just drunk and doing drugs, so I understood them. Now when somebody comes up to me drunk, I don't know what the fuck you talking about. It's a, it's a hard time when you're sober and they're drunk and they're insistent on talking because you're in two different frequencies and their frequency is very awkward to you and you don't. They don't realize that they're being awkward because they're drunk. You know, it's part of the problem. So some people are great drugs, some people, you know, they'll have a few drinks and you never noticed a thing. They're just happy having fun. Like Brian Collins. Good example that he ever see Brian Count drunk. No, even when he's drunk, he's just Brian Cowen drunk, you know, he's just having fun. Just being silly, you know, he uh, he maintains his character, you know, some people don't

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       and there's a certain people that they get drunk and you have to talk to if you're sober and they were drunk. It's like, wow, this is, this was getting nowhere. You can't. Yeah. They just don't get it. They don't understand that that's the big problem with being drunk because you'd almost, you know, you're drunk, but you don't really know how. You sound so terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       There's just no way. No Way. Totally know how goofy. Look everybody's drunk. You're fine with one person, so like, oh, this is so stupid. Yeah. But I realized how fucking Shitty I felt the next day or half a cigarette, like three pops. I threw it away. Like the next day I could feel in my body, I could still taste it. And you'll ball while you're doing it. You have no fucking idea. You know why you're doing all that shit. You know how bad his coke. We used your central nervous system. It's why you're doing it. You don't give a fuck. Jesus Christ. It gets to your bones. Yeah. I remember you saying that that was a great way that you described it like Joe Rogan. It's in your bones. When you talk to an addict and say to him, how come you can't get off? They'll say to you, man, this is a pain.

Speaker 1:          00:45:44       The withdrawal from heroin and even the Oxycontin, those bills, that's a heroin. You get to your bones, your bones start to hurt. You know? I've spoken with different people. I never had. I never went through that with with any drug, but I've spoken to people off of heroin when they kick heroin. It's a horror show. It's a fucking week long. Iris show a puke and then that other convulsions. That's what you eat and that I can't. I, I didn't do. I did heroin, but I snorted it the first time. I fucking put that pattern, my nose. It fucked with me for awhile, but I just put it in the back. It, you just put it in the back file and then doing coke with something, another complete harvest show for me because I didn't mind doing drugs. I just never wanted to do color. What I did coke, that was it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       I just like the first time I missed the fucking credit, but like the first time I could make a credit card payment. When I got divorced it ruined me because it was against my principal who I was like, you always pay your fucking, you know? Uh, so if you're doing, you feel like in yourself, like, wow, I'm letting myself down. Yeah. Once you put something up your fucking nose, you smack yourself in the face at that point. Nevermind shooting something and your vein. That is a complete. Yeah. That's the next level. That's, you know, I had a friend for years that was hooked on it. I come into his house on Monday mornings there'd be blood splatters on the walls from him missing the vein she uses. He would buy a $100 worth of heroin and they bought coke. He was doing the Belushi all weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       Oh my God. He would Belushi it all weekend. That speedball right. That's like the coke and the heroin together and it creates sort of a weird effect. It creates fuck getting a tornado in your brain. You just passed the fuck out, you know, this guy would be clean from Monday. He was brilliant from Monday to Friday. He could keep it together. I think Thursday night he would break down and do a little, like a little sniff just to keep them together during the week, but once Friday came, you wouldn't see him till Monday morning. During the week you would massage his veins. I got a massage. We got to get them to go home for the weekend and shit. Oh my God. And then he would switch like, how can you go from your arm to your toe? I guess you half like I can't find a vein.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       Joe. Hold on. Let me take my shoe off and fucking shoot my toe is just the first guy I ever had friends that did steroids. That was one of the most interesting nights of my life. We were doing coke in the middle of everything. He just took off his shirt and started doing pushups. He got up and he goes, look at me. What's different for you lifting? He goes, no. I started doing steroids and he started breaking it down to me. He was getting an addiction to steroids because he was going to every week and just shooting and they just went off a cycle. Then they just stopped breaking it up. He was on a cycle year round, but he was addicted to the needle going in his ass and then he would shoot it with vitamin B and he would tell me he can taste the vitamin B in his mouth and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       I didn't fucking shoot coke. You can taste it in your mouth. How you really? Yeah. So you. Oh, you shoot it now shooting coke. How much different is that supposed to be than snorting it? I have no idea, but what about the people that. I mean most pick something crazy. Birds of a feather flock together. I snorted. I hung out with snow artists once they talked to them about needles. That's when I go home. Once I see a needle, I go, I don't want to sit in a room where there's a fucking needle because I can't sit still. Once I see that syringe. You don't want me around. I don't want to be that. I went to cvs a month ago and they had syringes that they give you a free syringes. I almost fucking died. I don't like. I'm empty. I don't like. I'm full. I don't like to see them.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       Those people that carry the fixes with them, they call them a fix kit. Spoon and a syringe and a lighter and the needles here. Right. And that when they call it the gears, I would ask him like, so when you go over there, how do you shoot it? And he goes, we all stand around who and we. Then we all pass the needle. This is 82 when you could pass a veto from one guy to the other and shoot the ball and fucking that guy, these kinds of one needle to another. Then filling it with vitamin B. They would go, why are we gonna? You know, because if, I guess I don't know how the needle works. If you keep shooting, it gets dull. Yeah. Just take one neat on. But the nine guys knew each other through each other. Firstly you hepatitis

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       C, that's the first thing he got from that shit. That's just that. Now you get hepatitis C if you jam a needle into you that's been jammed into someone with Hepatitis C, right? I think so. But you on sexual transmission also? Correct. Right. He ever thought about that? Like I've thought about that before. Like herpes or anything warts. There had to be an original case like that had to be one person that developed this. Like how does that develop? I've always been curious like how the fuck does something like a herpes, so on point in time, but no one has her syphilis and you blog guy with Spanish syphilis. It becomes the harp they can together glide. That's what happens. It becomes more powerful, worse, you know, like right now supposedly all these diseases, they disappeared for a while. Then they make a comeback. Something was popular last year.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       We get measles. Was it? No, no sexual. Oh, something came back last year that was popular 10 years ago we came back. I don't know which one it was real or something like that. Like I got something like I've always had something. You've got something right now. I've had it for years because at night I get itchy. I don't know what the fuck is this. I lay down in bed, I get itchy as a motherfucker and when I asked you if you have a long run and colony of crabs just camped out and do something. When I took a blood test years ago, they were like, did you have something? I had something and I go, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       And they go, you must add something because to get the tail end I had something like when I first moved to La, I had something all those years on the road, you're going to get something now if you don't take antibiotics, if you get something like syphilis is what killed Al Capone. Right? I'm like, what? What happens if like other ones like gonorrhea, gonorrhea, kill you? I don't know. You just get better. I don't know. I know I had to guess. I think eventually something's got to happen through you. Can Gonorrhea be faithful, fatal and Kenny recover with no medication. Jamie, if you just do the Wim Hof method, which went hoff breathing, just just try, try to power through the gonorrhea. Syphilis killed you. I'm pretty sure syphilis kills. Like everybody that gets feed the venereal disease, but that's covers everything. Couple of. It's weird because venereal doesn't sound like sex, but that's what vd is. You know, [inaudible] a sexual transmitted disease. When you talking about someone having vd. When I was about 17, my friend fucked his sister's best friend and he's got something. He got VD, got vd and we went the next day and it was a chick with like fucking like the Phantom of the opera mark on her face. Dog. It was fucking crazy. What was the mark on her face? Like she. She had like syphilis or something started. She

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       had a cut in her lip and she sucked the fucked up

Speaker 1:          00:53:30       and it ran. I never forget this. It's not even funny. It was really sad because I didn't know what she had. I just went there with my friend. My friend goes, you got to go in there with me, dog. I'm scared to walk in there. Let's go. What's the big deal? They're going to give you? Pills, whatever. I didn't know. I wasn't sexually active at that age. He was and we went in there while I was waiting for him to go to. This chick came into the paperwork and she turned around and she had gotten something that started here, like she had like a cut or. What's that? When you have chapped lips or something and all this was like half purple and red. She sucks. Something bad and after that I was like, Ooh, I got to be careful out there. It's a jungle. That was the thing when we were kids, like someone has vd. Ah, she's got VD. Be careful. He's got VD VD. It was like, Whoa, you're here to here. Betty got bed. Oh that fucking girl got feet d, facebook friends with me from high school and the Pussy wouldn't get wet. They used to call the dry Hump Affairs Jersey. They used to call a fairview. The church either.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Oh, oh

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       People are so fucked up. Girl was banging. This girl was fucking banging though. So you'd have to like bring vaseline or something. And she was from Wayne, New Jersey, and she was banging. She moved to North Bergen, like she was a sophomore and she was dating a few guys. Shouldn't things happen like I was friends with. I know she didn't like me. She, she just didn't like me for some reason. I don't think the world to her either. And one nine, 84, I'm at a bar and this bitch comes in. I mean banging, banging, banging. They also said she had some type of Vd. So they called the lorry Jack, you know she's got the Jack CDC sang a song, she's got the Jack Jack. Jack said he used to call her name and Jack like, that was like, they just taught math at this girl and she did like a rocky, like a rock guy and had like long hair and whatnot.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       I saw rocky and she was banging Joe Rogan banging and I go, you live in North Bergen? I, she's like, yeah, I didn't go to college. I, I'm a, I'm a nanny. I'm a nanny. And she told me the guy's name and I knew that guy. That guy had a massage parlor years earlier, the guy that she was being a nanny for and I go, she says, nanny, he's just fucking. Or something's gotta be wrong. She looked so good in that mini skirt. She disappeared like 1:30 and finally like three. I'm sitting there, I'm like, what am I going to do tonight? And I had like a bag of coke or go fuck it. I'm going to go get him. So I went crazy. I was. I went to the dude's house who she's told me I knocked on door was 3:15 in the morning and he said, Coco, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       I go, I got to talk to Lori. There's something missing. He goes, hold on, Lori. And she came down and she comes outside, he's got a robe and she's got a robot. And I looked her straight in the face. I go, listen, I got like to eight balls in my pocket, get dresses, get the fuck out. And she's like, I can't. I go, you have to. And we argued that for like 10 minutes. I'm like, I want to suck your pussy. I want to do 30 things to you. I don't give a fuck about the VD or the Jack or the dry hump. I'm on fire. And she's like, well, give me 10 minutes and I know how am I going to sneak out of there? I Dunno. So I waited outside for. She's like, I'll put Lou embed, not run up. About 15 minutes later I see her running that with a purse with like a bank deposit bag was like, fuck him.

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       I can't take care of anymore. Fuck him. We were on foot. It's 4:30 in the morning. Totally Avenue. North Bergen is a bunch of those dirty hotels. So on my car I got a score here. I got co, she's got money. I'm going to fuck her. I'm excited. We go back to a hotel. We finally registered like $30. They asked us through one of the Jacuzzi in the room and shit. It was one of those dirty hotels on tonally as you go in New York City. We went in there, we walk in and she goes, rule number one, you are not going to find me. It's five in the morning that goes my fucking. That goes this night and all of a sudden she looks at me. She goes, well, if you could guess the color of my panties, I fuck you. I'm like, okay, read. And she goes, they're green, but good enough.

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       Started snorting coke, eat mass. I mean there was five in the afternoon and Doug Flutie was drawn. That quarterback that I was waking up, she was naked, rip apart. I'm waking up and Doug flutie strong the touchdown. I got dressed and got the fuck out and never saw her again. Never been robbed the money. I took everything. She pops up on facebook about two years ago and I'm like, Laurie, she's like, fuck you, you fat faggot and all this shit. She's like, you left me there that night, but we had a good time. Fuck yeah, we had a good thought and I will hit her back and go, what color are your panties? She goes, what? That's supposed to me. That instrument in the areas I knew, she gave me some. She had something but I didn't give a fuck. It was 84 rock Hudson was died.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       I didn't use a condom. I knew the consequences. I'm like, fuck it. So I knew I was going to get something and I probably did. I got crabs after that. Over the holidays I got crabs. Yeah. Eighty four, 85 season. I got crabs. I found that in the bathroom and port authority, the port authority to take a shit and I pulled my pants down and I'm sitting there reading the paper and I see a crap. Like I sort of sat and jump and I'm like, what the fuck? And I had never heard it. I had never heard nothing. I went home and took my underwear off and got

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       like a magnifying glass. It was over. It was all over me. They were all over the couch. I had to bring a bomb into the room, like one of those bombs and leave for 12 hours since you really. Oh, I grabbed the bucket. It was cramped up like, oh my God, lady next door knocked out. Mike that I was living in. Tenafly, New Jersey Lady. Next door knock. So you have a bug problem? I'm like, no, no, since you moved in here, there's been crabs and like y'all got fleas when I was in high school and you ever have a dog with fleas? Fleas get into the carpet and they had the ag act like a flea collar that you'd put on your dog with apparently worked and then they had these flea drops that you put on dogs. Fucking hated. He would score it on there for like at various spots like right behind the neck and then like in the middle of the back and the lower back and the dog would go fucking crazy and roll around on the ground.

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       Try to get that shit off them. But if you didn't do it you, your dog's going to get fleas. And we had carpet does that means you have fleas. So when you were walking I'd like in my bedroom, I'd be walking in my carpet and I'd see a flea jump onto my leg. I'd be like fuck. And once you have it you just have it, you know, like I mean there was some, some carpet stuff that I used to have to shake down. So I shake down all this poison shit all over my carpet and then you have to vacuum it up, but there's always one or two that survived one or two gangster fleas. It figured out how to fucking stay away from the powder and then figure their way right back onto your leg. And it was hard to get get it off the dogs too because then they would just go hang out with other dogs.

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       They'd get it again. Even if you cleaned him up and kill all the fleas that got them again. You could see the eggs, like he would click be cleaning them. Like your wash your dog at the base of their hair. You'd find the every fucking gross it was gone. It would just drop it and she'll over your carpet. Yup, Yup. Yeah, that's a giant issue if you have dogs that I had a dog once that had distemper, caught distemper from analog. It was so sad. He uh, was a puppy and he would go into convulsions, who'd have seizures. He was just a little puppy, was so sad. We had a wind up putting them down and um, put them down, man. My veterinarian. So good. A guy. This guy was, he was crying. He cried afterwards about how hard it is. I mean, the guy just love dogs. I love cats. He was just so upset, so upset.

Speaker 2:          01:01:59       It was really crazy, man. It was a weird moment that I'll never forget. He ended up dying in a car accident. Drunk driver, a drunk driver hit him, but I never forget that. I was like, wow, that guy got killed by a drunk driver. That guy, he didn't make any sense. It was such a nice guy. Boy, did he hate marriage? You know, I was young. I was 26 when I first met him, you know, they'd be like, you married? I go, no. He goes, don't get married. I'm like, okay. Explain to me marriage guys who have been to hardcore divorces, man, they have a fucking way. They have a way of grabbing you and putting that urgency and you listen to me. Listen to me. Don't fucking do it. Okay? Okay. I won't do it. I won't do it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:51       There's nothing as bad as the divorce. I would say death is probably worse. Some people. Divorce is great. You know what the problem with a lot of fucking people is, especially a lot of dudes with money is when you get married. Your wife has my two now, like before you got married, you were the guy with money, so you had a bunch of money and she's like, wow, like this guy got money and then when you get married, guess what? Now she's got money to now she gets her, recognize you for you and so it's not. You're not as cool anymore because you're not just a guy with money. She's got money to bitch to her fucking money now and she's like, God damn, I'm going to take my share and get the fuck outta here. Like all of a sudden she's got your money.

Speaker 2:          01:03:35       Like what happened? What happened is like there's a bunch of things that happen when people get married, right? There's love, there's devotion, there's commitment, there's a beautiful bond, the ego you guys share, but let's not get confused under the exact same rules with the exact same words. I do, I do. There's a lot of scamming going on. There's a lot of people getting robbed. There's a lot of legal extortion. There's a lot of legal stealing. There's a lot of really hot women who have no business. Fucking some old dude. There's a lot of really hot women that are like fucking some guy who's 70 years old and they talked this dummy it marrying them with no prenuptial they suck his dick for a couple of years and dropped a cup them and take a chunk. Just take a giant chunk of millions and millions of dollars. That happens to.

Speaker 2:          01:04:29       I'm not saying it shouldn't happen and I'm not saying it's, it's not an interesting deal. You know, that some people make, you know, like the Guy Married Anna Nicole Smith. Remember I used to have that bit about that guy that was the same kind of thing. It was like, nothing wrong with it. Everybody knows what it is, but you can't. That's not the same. Like all marriages is not the same. So people that were upset about like gay marriage, gay people that legitimately love each other and they want to get married, she'd be upset at this other shit. She'd be upset that you could go to vegas high on coke, go through a drive through and get married. You can do that. They're not drug testing you. They take you to those drive through Elvis fucking wedding chapels and Vegas. You think they see if you're dry, they don't give a fuck if you're drunk. You mean maybe you can get it a note tomorrow if you are. I mean maybe. I don't know. They don't give a shit that's marriage to. So it's a bunch of different things to God damn contract.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       No marriage is bad for somebody when they lose something. That's what a basic list. They lose a house, they lose money if you marry somebody. You know what I'm saying? You go ahead. I don't want to be married no more. Me Either. See the mom who's keeping the house. It's your fucking house by. Okay. That's great. Nobody. Nobody would get angry. Nobody would get it. It's when you lose something, right? You know, or somebody cheated on you or whatever. I had no money when I got divorced. It wasn't even that alone. So you're like, Yay. Yay. Oh fuck you. When I get to do comedy now the whole thing. But there was a kitten bowl. Right. And there's always fucking something. See, that's when marriage sucks. I also told myself that for years and it wasn't the marriage that sucked. Sometimes we don't put enough into the marriage. You know? I didn't know what marriage was when I first got married. I tell you what, I know my marriage is now, motherfucker. I know what marriage is now and that's why it works. I know you have to put time into when I first got married, you do the laundry, you cook and I give you a check and we fuck

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       I fuck you when I want. That's not mad. When you're 25, you think that's marriage, you know, you think that's marriage. That's where I thought, yeah, I'll go out and work. I didn't think you had to pay attention or go to a date night or fucking I have to put time into them. Or, you know, I can't do a spot tonight because I'm going to the movies with my wife. You know, you have to put that time and if you want it to fucking work,

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       yeah, you got to have an actual relationship. That's where it gets tricky. It's hard. It's hard to find someone that you enjoy talking to, you know, they enjoy being with not just doing stuff with, but just sitting alone and talking. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard to find people that are on the same wavelength as you. It's hard to find people that want to talk about the things you want to talk about or want to, you know, want to see things from your perspective and that you want to see things through their perspective that you want to have these open kind of honest conversations. It's not easy to find someone like that. These poor people that we all know that are unlike dating apps, like a, especially smart women. I know a lot of smart women that cannot find a fucking man to save their life. And you look at it, you're like, I don't get it. SMART, ambitious, powerful woman, hot. Can't find a man too hard out there. It's hard to find somebody that you sync with that you could talk to. I think it's way easier for a dude to find a cool chick that is for a girl to find a guy who's got his shit together. Maybe I'm just guessing, but I think it's probably harder.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       I felt a lot of single women out there to fucking good looking at jobs and shit, but we don't. We also know him like that too. It runs two ways. Joe. We didn't get that close to them that we didn't see what the idiosyncrasies works. Even with us, there's a bunch of women that look at you and God love to be with them. Then they get with this

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       guy flies out of town every fucking weekend. I can't be. You know what I'm saying? Like little things that they don't understand. Am I coming? No. He ever had guys that you're friends with who like back up off the comedy because they got a new girlfriend and the new girlfriend's like, I don't want you going out. You know, I don't want you doing sets every night. You don't have to do them every night like, but I do, if I want to get better, like that's like, you know how like baseball players to go to the field and practice? Yeah. I have to go on stage. It's the same thing. You don't think about it that way because you don't do it, but you got to understand it's the same thing. Well, when I did it, the stripper, the crazy bitch, she doesn't understand that. She was awesome by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:08:51       No, she was, she was you and her together with one of my favorite couples of all time. She still retarded. I loved a boyfriend, a picture of her boyfriend. Now he's got cockeyed. I mean she's a fucking nut. She's a fucking knows. One of the reasons why I fell in love with. She's a millionaire, you know, she's a fucking gazillionaire. He, these fucking dudes get all the money again. Sheet or at first when we broke up, she went to Florida and she ended up marrying this old Hindu guy. There you go. Like he was 76. They lasted three months. He died when I was at. What was I saying? Left her. His money. There you go. She took the money and invested in Jim's curves. Bought one, bought two or three, but four became like a fucking a mogul and then sold them all when they were still hot.

Speaker 2:          01:09:40       Wow. They went out of business. Curves. Went out of business. I think something, something. I don't know. They're not as popular as they were anymore here. The whole idea was like, don't work out that hard. I can keep it curves. Just come on in. Well, I thought it was a place just for everyone's willing to ambitious just for women. I didn't know it was just kidding. Oh, okay. But yeah, it is just a place for women, but you know, you hear like curves, you think of it as, you know when you say embrace your curves. Yeah, definitely. For sure. What are you trying to know? What are you really saying? Are you saying embrace your curves? You saying you know, don't work out that hard. What are you saying? Don't bother getting fit. What are you saying? I don't know. What you're saying, you can't go there.

Speaker 2:          01:10:18       You can't work out there. No, but you can. You can never have a men. Only Jim know if you had a men only gym, it will be empty. Well, wouldn't. It wouldn't even matter. Like women would protest appellee's fucking humps go to the gym to see girls anyway. Most of them, most of them do, so that's why it would be empty. There's a lot of guys go to the gym and they don't even get motivated unless girls working out there, don't look at them. Look at them. Monday, workout yoga pants. Very primal. You know you're like naked, but covered up with like cloth, like paint, paint cloths, that little monkey sweating like yoga pants. You're feeling like trump grabbed that fucking monster. I was with my friend Cameron Hanes in Boston. We're working out at this gym and there was this girl that was, you know those hardcore gym girls. His hardcore gym girls who just go, I follow a couple of them on instagram and they do squats and fucking they're doing like what a perfect example is that guy carrying who is here carrying fitsgibbons. His wife's name is Jack Jessica. She's a crossfit champion and she's just ridiculously fit. Just ridiculously fit, but those kinds of like gym girls, don't. They scare the fuck out of you? A little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:11:35       Little crazy. I don't say nothing to him. I just walked right past them. There's a girl, but why that doesn't? That lists the whole fucking thing. She's crazy. She's fucking brutal. Mean campaigns. We're looking at her and Kim's like, I want to be built like her. I wish I had her build. She was jacked. This lady was just doing squats and shit. Fucking powder on her hands and shit. Big Ass dead lifts, so women just embraced that. They love it. Now if they were told they can't go to a gym because it's an all male power lifting gym,

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       but the problem is like a girl goes to a gym and hits on guys. It's really not that big of a deal, but if a guy goes to an all girl, gems starts hitting on the girls, that becomes a. That becomes gross. That's becomes harassment. Like he can't. You can't work out just a different feeling. It's a different feeling for them to hit on us than it is for us to hit on. That just know is not the same kind of danger. You know, a guy hitting on a girl. There's a certain element of danger involved in that. Right? The girl, like if some crazy girl comes to the gym, she's like, Hey, I found a fucking give you a dead lift. You know what I mean? You wouldn't, you wouldn't feel threatened. Like, get Outta here. Crazy

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       to lose you. But, but like if you go to crunch those Hollywood gyms and all those, you see that the girls get ready an hour before they go to the gym, make up the hat with the tail coming out. They're color coordinated. I mean, they go to those gyms to get picked up and the guys that go there, they go for action to when you go to the y, it's slows down a little bit. Let's do a couple of women that go in there. They gotta stab and I see him all the time. They go in there with the little towels and the yoga pants and then mingling with the trainers and shit, but then you go to other gyms. That's not even happening. It's just certain gyms called for that. You also recognize what a person's got going on physically. You see some girls in one of them, those things, she got that, but bob machine, you know that one, like they're sending out pheromones and shit and they're showing you their shape. You know they got yoga pants on or shorts. Shorts are risky, especially when you're doing them kinda kicking maneuvers. There was any sort of opening there and some things get pushed aside or come flying out of the bottom of there yet. Be careful. It's a move,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       but you're. You're seeing them exert. You've seen them work hard. Seeing them show their vitality. You know on the lift in that there's always like some dude helping them come up. One more, one more, one more, but she's not just doing that for him. She's doing that for other guys too. She's like putting out that sent. Accelerating the game. The whole competition just ramps up a couple of notches while she's doing squats. Ass Out, ridiculous squats, deep clink, high five. The guys walks around, makes eye contact with the audience. See who's checking around hard. There was a girl at the y when I first started going on one in Hollywood, Spanish girl, torture, torture. She wouldn't shave her armpits flow and the sweat would drip from her armpit. And here's where it gets better. She would always wait gray sweatpants and she wouldn't wear underwear. So you can see the sweat from a monkey come right through the fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       So she walked up to see the fucking wet thing. Egg right toes. She didn't give a fuck. She was hot as fuck. You know, I'm an old man. I've been talked to a black car and that talking to the different guys, but she'd be benching and she opened up her thighs and that little swamp just be fucking drenched with sweat. It was tremendous. I would look at it and shake my fuck. This girl's, you know, Hollywood man. That's what happened. Let's start with the Hollywood. Yesterday morning I had to be that lunchtime and I'm driving and I see a black dude that wade, he was six feet with 120 pounds, that skinny with Clint Eastwood hat on from a fistful of dollars and the Poncho from clothing and he was standing next to a big, fat white dude with a beard like Jesus with sandals and the Jesus thing.

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       And I said to myself, dog, I'm in Hollywood. This is it. This is it. It's fucking. This is what I'm going to say. You know, you see that at the comedy store almost Sunday night, Sunday night. You see that one dude dresses like Jesus. Yeah, he no explanation. One time he came by and he wasn't dressed like Jesus. I was disappointed. I seen that guy 100 times at least dressed like Jesus, and then one time I saw him, he wasn't dressed like Jesus. So I was like, what the fuck are you doing here, man? Like once you commit to that outfit. Right. Have you ever seen him without the Jesus outfit once? Yeah. He said he walks in Jesus to his head down like that folder from the back. And He. It's interesting. I mean he found something. He found his niche. I guess they used to be at duty.

Speaker 3:          01:16:54       You remember the guy who used to walk up and down the street with a cross on his back? A bunch of people behind them. Yeah. Yeah. There was a dude who used to walk down the street with a cross and sometimes people would carry the cross and sometimes he would strap it on his back, but he would walk down with a bunch of disciples. They all had bibles and they would start like yelling out different, uh, different quotes from the Bible and they would, uh, tell them to people in the front patio. This is back before the front patio had a bar. Remember the front patio was basically wasted space until the new administration came along and when did they open up the bar at the front patio? I don't know how many years ago before I came back, but now it's a vibrant little foggy. It was always something, man, he had it.

Speaker 3:          01:17:38       Princess Corey had it, but she opened the just so she could drink. That's it. I mean she used to open. She was walking away. People be like, what is the bartender? You know, it was never really. They, it would sell like nine beers or something. Now it's a fucking bar. Like you said. Do you know they used to do shows. There were on the back patio. They had a standup show there. They would set up a mic out there when they did it a couple of years ago apparently. But the neighbors complained before we came back. They, they were, they would have like an open mic night. They would have a spill out show where they would have an open mic night out there on the patio, but apparently someone, people just yelling at God or something. You know what I mean? The yelling, the microphone.

Speaker 3:          01:18:21       That's such a fucking, you know, I was watching almost famous the other day. You ever watch that movie? Almost famous. I was whatever. I was watching it and they got to the part when they were at the hotel next door and they actually, you see them crossing the street in the store. The lights are blinking at the store. It's supposed to be 19, 69. What are you gonna do with the store? Fucking put a board over it. But that was the hotel like that was a hot hotel. When the store went from Ciro's to the store, was it closed down for awhile? I'm not sure because the store is, was opening the seventies, right? I want to say 74 or something. Is that right? Seventy two. Seventy four. Seventy two. Seventy two. Seventy two. So that. But what, but Ciro's was in like the Bugsy Siegel days, which was what wasn't that like the 19 thirties or something? No, twenties. When was the Bugsy Siegel? Maybe the fifties. Yeah, it must be right. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Right. It was sears as closed in 1957. And then it was a rock club, rock and roll club in the 19 sixties. Wow. What was that called?

Speaker 5:          01:19:30       Uh, just added another page.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       It's the best spot in Hollywood. It doesn't say what it was called, but it was. You were just saying that you were talking one day and you said that that must be like a beam that shoots down to put all those people together at the comedy store. Where if we look at that fucking almost famous. I mean everybody stayed at that hotel next door. That was a spot where you just checked in when you weren't on tour. We're not on tour this year. What do you want to do? Let's go to the riot house and get fucked up for a week and a half. Yeah. It's amazing how those two spots and next to each other like this. So legendary. And then next to each other. I'd like to get some sort of fucking native

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       American medicine man to walk around that place. Tell me what kind of spirits he senses. Just 200 years. Two Hundred Years of comedy, of uh, the of murders, the Bugsy Siegel days, like how many people were whacked in that spot? The rock days. How many people? Probably odd of a rock club and the 19 sixties and seventies before it became the store. How much craziness went on there and you believe February 19th. On my birthday I'll be at the store 20 fucking years. Wow. That's crazy. Twenty years. That place was in my life. Like usually you hang out at the bar, your neighborhood go for like four years. Then you graduate, you're done. You know those bars that you all trickle down a bug visa, whatever the fuck. I've been going to the store for 20 years. Second time I got on state, somebody came up to me and said, there's Mitzi shore seeing you yet.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       Like I was always destined for the school. Like I knew it. I knew it. Like I just know it. And then the more I got into comedy, over the years people would say to me, there's Mitzi scene he had. She likes characters or whatever. But it's so weird. I had been there for 20 fucking years. I. We were talking the other day about how she used to call you fat baby. That was your name on the line. I'm a fat baby. Oh, it's my navy and she would stick a finger in my stomach and go, still let the era. That's how cool. Mr Joe always my fat babysit over here next to me. Fat Baby. Let me see your stomach. Let me rub it. And then she would put the pin in it. Twenty fucking years. I went home the other night. I had scratched my head a few times, like 20 years.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       I've been doing this kind of a shift. The 25 fucking years. First Time I got on stage that I fucking think I'd be here 25 years later I think I started don't, I didn't think anything. I just thought a finally I'm going to be able to do something with my life. Like that's all I wanted to do. Just something with my life, you know, talking to my buddy because ever since I shot the special, been thinking about 90, 19, 93 a lot. Like how well I was 1993. It was living in New York City. Why 90? Three specific. That's when I made my transition. That's when I did comedy for two years. The way I went to Jujitsu for two years, it was very erratic. I would go twice one week, one week I wouldn't go. Then I go three times one week and then I would go for two weeks.

Speaker 1:          01:22:32       It was very erratic. I didn't know how to really get my hands on it, but in 1993 I went to the city. I was just. I was broken from the divorce at nothing going on. I was broke. I went home and lived with a friend of mine and just went around the city and did calm me and I had no, I had no comprehension and what I was doing. And then one night I walked into your old triple in. Used to be like an open mic that started at 11 and went till two or 3:00 and I went in there one night about. I just finished driving a limo and I dropped the guy off in Manhattan and I go, let me go get a spot over that, and I went over there and they said, there's no spots tonight because Leguizamo is on stage and he was working.

Speaker 1:          01:23:16       One of those one man shows this place was a fucking dive. Like every time I'd walk in there I think about my comedy career. I got to figure something out because I'm not going to keep doing this display. Smelled like cigarette smoke. There were seven people in New Orleans. You know what I'm saying? When you first started do Konami you're waiting for the lights and the CBS to be there and shit. CBS Ain't going to be here. Why do I keep coming back here? And finally one night I went there, I saw like it was dominant one. Then I go, I get it, I get it. I thought it was too special. I'd have to do that, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:23:52       Sorry, I officially. I'm one of those fucking things. We got a piece of bone. Something you gotta you gotTa make me cough. Sorry. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A leg was almost onstage. It was a dive and it really. I didn't know. I didn't know anything about comedy. I had read the Judy Carter Book. I had read a couple books by that fucking writer that when that real solutia ball, three Belzer's book, who Richard Belzer know wrote a book on stand up comedy. I read the book by Lenny Bruce. Ladies and gentlemen. We live at the Chelsea hotel and he fucking did heroin at night with jazz musicians. Oh yeah. That's a great. Put me over the top, but I taught standing up or something that you became. I didn't know you had to work on it. That's what I'm trying to say to you. I thought that when people went up on stage shoot a special like Joe Rogan Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:24:43       Tell Him we got cameras really? Alright, cool. Tell him to go on state. I thought when you shot a special, you just went up and talked for 30 minutes. I didn't know there was any preparation. I didn't really have anything to go by. I went in there and I understand the process now. I think three, not even like a month later I was back in Colorado and I was determined to get onstage every night. This was what I was going to do. This is what I'm going for, this is how I'm going to do it, you know, these are the clubs I'm going to work. I had no, no idea what the fuck was. I would just go on stage loosely. I would write whatever I could and just go on stage loosely. I never knew that you build from that. I didn't know these things, so I keep thinking about 93.

Speaker 1:          01:25:27       I lived in a fucking room with my buddy who did heroin. I had one white shirt. I would sell cars on 11th avenue down there, you know, New York City. I had one white shirt and I would wear the same shirt everyday. I would have to come home, jump in the shower, and I would wash my shirt in the shower and I would hang it up and then I would iron it every fucking day. You know? I was just a struggling open Miker, you know, I was driving a limo some days, some days I would sell cars, some days I would pass out packages for att and t and get $400 a week. I was just putting it together, man, you know, and it was, it just seemed

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       so interesting. Like I just, I didn't, I had no illusions of grandeur bro. I just wanted to do something with my life. There was no, I wasn't going to be Kevin Hart or fucking bill cosby and nothing. I just want to do something, you know. So this is why I keep thinking about how fucking Tony, three years later I shot a special and just, it just goes back to what you did. You know, I had one, I would have to, I wouldn't have to be at work till 10 some days, but I would take the 6:00 AM bus because if I take the 6:00 AM bus, my friend with the steroids, his father was a bus driver. He let me right to the city for free. So I would take the 6:00 AM bus so I could save those $3. That's how fucking poor I was. And then to get home I would fucking go into service when I would sell cars and we go into the service at 9:00 and I would still change when people's cards until I got home.

Speaker 3:          01:26:55       I would bring just enough money for lunch between rent, child support, close reefer cocaine and fucking. I wasn't even doing a lot of coke then if my buddies and I will have to do it because I was just trying to do comedy, you know? And you think about the beginning, what you really went through, how you were, you delivered papers, write papers or whatever and to see you now. It's such a big difference. But I never saw this. I never saw the tail end of this. I just wanted to do something. You know? Yeah. When you see someone that's already doing comedy clubs and headlining places and you're just starting now, it doesn't seem that far away. It's like, oh, I need to do is just get an act together and I can do what he's doing. How come I can't do it and you think you can and then it takes years.

Speaker 3:          01:27:41       Like somebody tried to tell me once that it took 10 years for you to become a real headline or my dad's crazy headliner in two years, get out of here, but it really does. It really does because there's something. Something happens 10 years in or maybe you're smarter than me. Maybe it'll only take you a couple. But for me it was like 10 years and I get a better understanding what the fuck I'm doing. I'm like, Oh, I kinda get it now. I kind of get it now, but you still don't see it the way you would see it if it wasn't you. If you know as much as you know about standup and you could watch yourself not be you, you would be able to fix a lot of things with your act. But a lot of the things with your act like you kind of shield yourself because you're just trying to get it to work.

Speaker 3:          01:28:23       Just trying to put it together, you know, and a lot of times you're not even aware of, uh, how the joke is coming off to other people because you're doing it yourself. You're too caught up in the idea of delivering it to understand what it's like to receive it. And that takes a long fucking time to figure it out. And still to this day, I fuck it up to those day, especially when I'm working on new bits because you got to take these weird chances with new bits. You got to like start premises maybe that you don't know where they're going and let, let it, let it under pressure of stage sometimes come out. You know, especially when you're working out at the store trying to come up with new stuff under the pressure of being onstage. You can sort of like every now and then pop an idea through every now and then a new tagline comes through that makes you laugh and a new moment comes through.

Speaker 3:          01:29:11       And if you don't invest in those moments of doing those, those bits on stage, you never fucking know. And if you don't take those chances, if you just keep doing the same shit over and over again, you don't take those chances, you don't. You don't know whether or not you could go down those roads, go ahead and become a headline until 18 years. That's when I felt comfortable. Headline. That's crazy. I had 40 minutes to six years, 45 minutes. I love when guys look at you and go, well, I got a bowel. The big difference in being a fucking headline in my friend. Okay. This weekend there's a great fight on the card. It's surgery. It's Pedis Pedis against Anthony Pettis Holloway. Right? So you look at Max Holloway's in his nine, zero fucking hits hard. Heart of a lion, crazy pet has had something called experience. He's been in there with Benson and he's been in there with some big fucking names.

Speaker 3:          01:30:00       He's been then championship fights when the lights matter and shit like that. That's called experience. That experience is so fucking crucial. That experience is so crucial at the store. I am very proud to be a store comic because of all those years of doing those weights bites. So you, I get myself out of any situation, I get myself out of it and he situation. When you're a plumber, when you're, uh, when you're a Roofer, okay day, your job is the same. You're gonna fucking roof. Why you're paying me 25 instead of 15 is because I know how to get around the problems. When you come to me and go boss the fucking pipe there. I got a flashlight and stop. There's a piece of cake. I just build a box around you follow me. It's the same thing with comedy. Like it. I knew I could do an hour, but I always felt like that pennzoil commercial.

Speaker 3:          01:30:51       You could either pay me now or you can pay me later. I love those motherfuckers to come out here and go, bitch, I been, I was a headline at four years. I'm a regular at the store. You know what? They're going to get it at the store one night. They're going to get it, they're going to get it. They're going to have to follow somebody who they're not ready for. And it's not because they've only been doing comedy six years. It's going to hurt them a little more than it would hurt me. And you talk. I know there's a 50 slash 50 shot everyday. I write jokes. I prepare them. I know I'm going to go up there and do the best I can, but sometimes that don't pay that and sometimes there's a girl in there before you attended a great night every other night.

Speaker 3:          01:31:31       She's bombed tonight. She blows up that place and you got to go up there and figure a way around it. That's an experience. Fucks you up. That's when I could. You could blow up that room and I'll tell you what, I may not be able to follow you, but I'll get a few labs with. Ten years ago I wasn't getting anything because I was caught up in the lights and let's keep it going for joe or more time. It's really funny and not use that word, but if you go up there and just run with that energy, it's experience in my world. You know, I didn't make any big decisions so I got fucking. I could feel the difference on state now. Twenty five years. You could do anything. You John Jacques Machado. You Ever See John Jack Rowe? He talks to you. He talks to Joe and rolls with me, Eh, not silly phone.

Speaker 3:          01:32:16       God, whatever. He doesn't even know because he's been doing it for 20 years and I just saw a guy, a guy did that. Marcello Garcia died, then a seminar and he was for years. I just put myself in the half guard. He goes, I could feel anything you got to do. He goes, even when you're going to pop that leg over to get away. He goes, I'll just catch you with this leg and put you now. I got your neck. It's amazing. I go, how'd you get that? Good. He goes, I put myself in half guard every fucking day for 10 years. I know exactly what reaction you're going to do. It's called experience when you got. I never had the hard times. I have had at the comedy store, when you're dying at a club and it's a feature headliner Mc club, you have momentum to pick yourself back up.

Speaker 3:          01:33:02       So if I go over there and pick up die for 10 minutes, I could get onto something and gradually work them back at the store. You don't have that grace. You have 15 fucking minutes and once you die at the store for seven minutes, it's like the fucking Roman colosseum. You run them with. That ain't no getting back into the store to store. I've never had a medium set up the store. I either do great or I fucking die. I die most of the time. But if you know what I'm saying here, I'm in the store. There's no coming back. You don't have 20 minutes of work itself out of the situation. They also know there's a bunch of people coming. Next comes next. Who's next? Who's next? What else? We got to see, you know, and sometimes you'll see someone that's just there just on a normal night.

Speaker 3:          01:33:45       Maybe their ideas would work, but tonight it's not going to work because it's just been too many different people on before them. And then it's just I've seen too much, you know? Then that's one of those things where those late night spots are so important. I wonder if that exists in music too. I wonder if in music it helps the performers, if they get occasionally a real small crowd, they have to sing for a crowd of 15, 20 people, you know. I wonder if that lets you get in your own head better, you know, but we can point on lives, especially those first six years of the comedy store, 1245, you've got to assume there's going to be 17 people in the audience if you're lucky, if you're lucky and you have to say something that they haven't heard. If they sat there all fucking night, they've heard everything.

Speaker 3:          01:34:29       They've heard everything topical and it would force you to go out of your realm. I love it. You know when we shot, we were telling them about specials, shooting specials. When I shot the first show, I died because I was too worried about my material. I really bought into Jerry Seinfeld. Then I remembered what the fuck I am the second show, and you just now you get it back. Yeah. There's so many different focuses is 25 years. You shoot a special and you still fucking up come. Yeah, a dog. This is why I love this because I learned something new every fucking day. It's definitely. Well, as long as you have new subjects to talk about, you're going to have new ideas, so you're going to have new bits. So you're going to have work to do. They're not going to be done. They're not done right away.

Speaker 3:          01:35:13       You got to go over them. You got to listen to recordings. So there's a lot lot going on. It's, it's, it's weird in that like if you go to see the rolling stones, you want to hear it brown sugar, you know you, you want to hear a sympathy for the devil. If I go to see you, I want to hear some new shit. Now. It's just the way it is for our business, but it's also so exciting. You know? I mean, it's such a fun fucking thing to do. Well, there's two. There's two trains of thought to this that are really interesting because I did something this year that I knew I couldn't pull off like there's no way, but for me, I could only shoot a special every 18 months. My next special is no. Once I looked at the product and the special, I knew that those jokes could have still had six more months of work and you follow me.

Speaker 3:          01:36:00       That's the problem. We have to. There's a joke. I closed it, but I've been doing it now for two years just because people say, I came to seeing you and do that fucking job and I've noticed how good that joke is become, and every two weeks I had a tag for that joke even though it's still fucking old when I do it. This is exactly what Tom Papa said on Monday. Exact same thing. It bothers me to no end. You know, I put a CD out a couple years ago and I liked the bit I did, but that bit was not finished. I didn't know at the time. Right. I didn't know at the time. Right. It's ready, fuck no. I've added 10 minutes for that bit in the last fucking year, just because I liked it so much. There's something in there. Yeah. What the fuck did I do? I just let it go.

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       So as a trainer thought that, and I didn't know this. Listen me, when I come to see you every year, I want you to have 30 minutes of material. Something had to happen in your life. Yeah. What you're telling me is you can make that joke better. Run it by me. Let's see what else you added. Let's see what else you added to it. So. And that's what I'm going to continue to do now. Those jokes that I had from the special guests, what I'll put them away now, but I'll bring them back in a year and how at different tags and even if every time you do a long set, just bring one bit back down to six and do it. They don't. They're going to strengthen. Mm. And one day you're going to be able to do three hours. I don't, I don't fucking know, but I'm just saying it's nice those bits and never done.

Speaker 3:          01:37:21       That's a mistake I made on the first two albums, those bits and never done, but they're done sometimes. Right? Sometimes you get to them when you're like, I don't even want to do this anymore. Oh No, you're. When you're done, you're done. That's why I didn't call for responses. We know that I'm building. I went to Portland last week. I'm done. He just started to take some time off. You need to recharge. Recharge. Yeah. Right. You need to do come on thing. You need to get a. sometimes when you do too much county in a row, you go to stuff. I want to deprogram myself, you know, special. I didn't want to keep saying I'm coming on the feet. I didn't want to keep. I didn't want to keep doing the jute that. So I stopped deprogram yourself. You've got to break those bad habits to break that habit.

Speaker 3:          01:38:02       The only way to break that habit, just to forget about it. Right. At least when it comes to comedy, you know, I want to forget about it and I won't do it no more. I had a lot of promotion that shit. This week I podcast you, I had a ton of shit. It's Christmas. I got to take it to the zoo at night for the fucking lights, so I said this is a great week to do it, but I've learned a lot man from shooting this that no specials ever done. That's why we want to hear if you go see the stones, you might be disappointed sometimes because sometimes the stones to play a song, it doesn't sound like what you're used to listening to it because over the years they added this fucking whole thing on the road to it, which you'll never hear because you didn't go, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:38:43       Yeah. You definitely get hear that. Sometimes when people do live versions or something, they put a whole new twist to it. Like that band, honey, honey, they do that all the time. They'll do a song and it's like it's a different version of a song that I've heard on their CD. I think going to see live bands is good for us to excellent for us. First of all, let's be honest. You know when your dad was. I was watching something. What was that? Oh, I was watching a video of Johnny Cash. It's A. Okay. And I had to ask myself this question. I go, Joe does as a comedian. You're going to fucking tell me that a little bit of Johnny cash isn't me. That's how I wanted it. I wanted Johnny cash. I want a little bit of the allman brothers that guarantee. I want you to know that this could get dirty quick.

Speaker 3:          01:39:29       Yeah, we. This could be quick. This can be zero to 100 quick and this motherfucker I want a little lennon skin and in my comedy, that singer, the way he looks at you and shit, it's just the sad. A Spanish all my copy. Know my comedy has Julia serving in it. My comedy has Richard Pryor. You've got lenny bruce in it. Any bad. I liked the fucking thunder. Have led Zepplin that done. There were lab you watch led Zepplin from the garden. There's no fucking lights or explosions. Were midgets running around? It's just for dirty white motherfuckers and I liked the fucking lead sapling effect in my standup. It all mixes in there, but Johnny cash is definitely my standup for sure. Definitely that shit. Definitely everything you've ever seen that's made you feel good. Gets in absolutely absolute fucking. Everything. Movies, everything. How much do you know about Rodney Dangerfield?

Speaker 3:          01:40:29       Half and half. We're trying to figure out when what the. There's a bunch of different stories of the no respect, like when it changed it to no respect. Someone was telling me it was from a fucking movie at a movie came out and then after that movie he just started saying, no respect, no respect, no respect at all. That guy was awesome. I'm so glad I got to meet him. I got to meet him. Apparently he was still doing coke, who's like seven years old, who's hanging out with this 40 year old hot, broad, having a great time, which I got a call to go to a fucking audition one day and I go, what am I reading for Lego? You're reading from the new Rodney movie. I go down to the sunset right by the Tequila hut down before we hit the comedy store.

Speaker 3:          01:41:17       There's that little tequila at that light there. [inaudible] 50 feet and I went in there and I walked in the room and who's in the room have Rodney dangerfield though? This is the motherfuck. I weighed the ear for the see easy money because in my world, easy money is fucking tremendous. I went to the. I went live. I don't drink. You just said it yourself. Joey, don't drink. I took an eight pack of Budweiser neps to see fucking easy money. Okay. Budweiser nip the smaller ones, cracking the things and flicking it. I was having a good time, but Rodney. Okay. I walked into this room and his Rodney Dangerfield, I'm going to read for Rodney Dangerfield. I get the things. I want you to sit here. You know, whatever. I didn't overly au Jus the reason why he hasn't seen all that shit. I just read Bro. And he goes, listen, I really like your read the road.

Speaker 3:          01:42:07       You're the role you read for is already cast, but do me a favor. Just show up. You didn't know that Joe. So he goes, just show up. He called the house. My wife answered. She was dating me. She goes, you know Rodney call day before, like, what do you say? She goes to go to Hollywood studios tomorrow at eight in the morning. I go to that. I get the road. He didn't say, I called my agent. My leg goes, now he's going to find something for you. Just show up. That's how much he dug me. Seven days. I worked on this movie though. It's the worst movie of all time. Only comedy central as it once a year. Like at four in the morning. It's called back by midnight. I play Joe. Joe backed by them were all in prison, were all in prison. And uh, we, we, we, we figured out that we break out at night and go steal the hardware store supplies and we fucking got lounges.

Speaker 3:          01:43:05       Jacuzzis at the prison now everyday I wouldn't have to go in and they sign up. They go, no, you got to go see Rodney. So I have to walk into Rodney's trailer. Knock on the door. He danced with fucking the robot naked commodity sign and he got, I see you tomorrow night. And that was my job seven fucking days, Bro. He was old. He couldn't remember his lines. They had to read them the lines off camera and then he would say the lines over again. But for me it meant the world man. That's Rodney Dangerfield, man. That's huge. Yeah. He's. I mean, when you think about all time influential figures with his Rodney dangerfield specials, he introduced the world to some of the greatest of all time. Great. Greatest. And not a lot

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       of people will ever do something like that. Yeah. A lot of comedians would never do. Have you ever heard some of the backstories to the. To the HBO specials? Yeah. No, no. To the Rodney. Things like how he got into it with. He got into it with the. What's his name? [inaudible] at dice wears leather jackets. Barry Sobel. You know, he stuck up for comics, right? I could be. I hate working at clubs where it's a comedy, a comic on club, and they treat you like a dick. You ain't some fucking do from Missouri. You're a comic. How can you treat me like this? Like he really fought for comics. You know, and there was one story where barry sober wanting to wear a leather jacket, I kept arguing with him and he goes, dog, you know, dice West Eleventh, knock it the fuck off. Go get a sweater.

Speaker 2:          01:44:40       That would suck though if your battery. So when you wear a leather jacket all the time, I think he ended up wearing the leather and the special. I don't know if he did. Didn't he have like a members only jacket made out of leather? Something something.

Speaker 1:          01:44:51       Uh, just just amazing when you're around those people. You know, when that was around Rodney that week, it was just fucking great though. Paul Rodriguez kept on doing an impersonation of him. He goes, go ahead and do another impersonation of the fight. And you replaced it with George Lopez.

Speaker 2:          01:45:06       Say Shit the rest of the week.

Speaker 1:          01:45:10       Rodney wasn't fucking around. He was still smoking dope. He was still smoking dope all day. Walk around the set with a joint in his hand. You gotTa love it. Wow. Did you ever see when he was going on stage with a bathrobe on? No.

Speaker 2:          01:45:26       He did a lot of shows where he was naked with a bathrobe on and go on stage with fucking slippers. He would slide up to this stage, just fucking walk up to the microphone and do his entire hour with a fucking bathrobe on with nothing underneath. I was working as a security guard at great woods in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Great Woods. Like the concert place is an outside amphitheater and you know, a covering of some part of the areas covered in the back area is exposed as the lawn. And Rodney played there, you know, it's a big fucking place. Like Bon Jovi played there. I saw bill cosby there. I saw Kennison there. And uh, Rodney, I didn't say a fucking man. Bill cosby's. I wasn't paying attention to him. He was there and I didn't watch like I saw him there. He was there. I barely paid attention.

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       I just, I wasn't into what he was like. I thought of him as like a clean comedian. That was 19, you know, I was too crazy, but I'm. Rodney was in the back and one of the guys who works for us, because dude, he goes, Rodney's back there as dick and his balls are hanging out, I guess fucking bag. He doesn't give a shit. I don't give a fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. I always got no pants on. He's got nothing on and I saw him walking around with a bathrobe. I've remember seen it like remember, like looking down this hall towards the back area where the backstages and I'm seeing Rodney greenroom and he's

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       walking around was bathrobe. I'm like, that is fucking amazing. He would go on stage. I remember him going onstage. I remember him killing too. Yeah, we loved him. He was an old man. I didn't give a fuck. I'm not to interrupt you. The other day I saw a thing on. Somebody posted this. It was Frank Sinatra on the tonight show and Don rickles Kaimana. Oh yeah, I did. You torture him. Todd ruckle's is amazing. You see, if you find johnny years from John, first off, so not just so bad as tremendous. Listen, man, that dude. I watched those two things. The Hbo bottom and I fell in love with them. I don't care about all those behavior problems I watched that meant as a bad mother fucker dog. What behavior problems did he have? I don't know. Like he just fucking put up with this gentle shit. Look at. Watch this. Watch this show. Really crank this up. Make this look good with his boots out and shit. You got boots? Look at him.

Speaker 6:          01:47:55       Pull the audio from Youtube.

Speaker 3:          01:47:58       Can they hear the audio? No. The people can't. Oh, give them a little audio. The audio recording can do youtube can't. Why can't they? Johnny Carson. This would definitely get pulled from youtube. Alright folks. Unfortunately you're going to have to. If you watch this on youtube, you'll have to listen to the audio version of. It's called a. what's the name of it?

Speaker 6:          01:48:22       Johnny Carson show

Speaker 3:          01:48:23       was this. How old do you think Johnny was here? What's this chart? Both of them got to be 60 this face. This is the animal he will ask when he takes his hand, the way it drops down on his knees, he's kissing the king's hall. The Sinatra this know. Maybe say he's got the wig. It's a light wig. He never went to crazy with the wig. He never went full. Burt Reynolds. There's no one here in this. Unfortunately. They can't hear this on youtube right now.

Speaker 3:          01:49:13       What's that? The audio recording here. Yeah, but the people on Youtube that are watching and we'll watch in the future can hear it. Right. Let's not do that. It makes her. Makes her goofy thing, but no one is watching these guys. He's touring still, you know? Yeah. He's 90. He's young. Don rickles is down at the Canyon club when it was soon. He's called the Canyon Club with a. what's his face? Regis. Let's go. Yeah, find out what the club? Yes. Regis and Don rickles a touring together. They have a little act. Fuck yeah. I'm going to that shit. Fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       That is Kinda hope it doesn't pass already. Goddammit. Did it pass already? They have a billboard on the one on one. If you're coming back from thousand oaks, he could see it on the one on one that shows all the different people that had ted nugent's there once a year. Every year around July. Dance around stage. Yeah, all the time. But he's good. He's good friends with him so he's not the best place to do stand up because they make people stand in the back. You know that people get seated in the front, they stay in the back, will show up tall people that have for you last time.

Speaker 2:          01:50:20       But that was the problem was it already happened November 18th. Oh Shit. But it was a. There was a lot of people there, but I had a deal with them. I said, I only want to sell tickets to the people that get to sit down. I go, as soon as you run out of seed to tickets, I go stop selling tickets. And the guy kept filling the place like, oh, what are you doing? He goes, well, people are still buying tickets. I go, well, they'll stop selling them like you have a deal. If the contract is you're not supposed to have people standing up like I was going to get less money so that people could have a seat like because it'd be better and better. It's a lot better and he's like, yeah, but we're still selling tickets. Like alright, we're done. Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:50:54       Like you know what the contract is dude. Like they just decided to smoosh everybody in there. It's just not as fun to stand around and watch comedy. I really didn't. When I went to see doug once doug was doing a lot of those bar shows, standing room shows and then went there as much as I love Doug and it was like concrete someplace in Hollywood. We were standing there in my fucking your legs start hurting like this is not fun. I don't want to just stay in here. I want to sit down. Like you don't enjoy it as much if you're not sitting down when you start talking. Yes, and the conscious just goes away from the standing by the 40 minute mark. It's like a light talk. Yup. In the room and you can't blame them. You could be throwing heat, but a couple of weeks ago at this thing I got there and they had 200 people standing up to argue with the fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          01:51:39       Now I was nothing you can do. I didn't even think about it and I could feel him onstage and you can work through a little bit, but you feel at this stabbing man. I remember when we used to do the House of Blues in Vegas. Yeah. That whole back area was still with people standing and talking and the two bars bars to the left and a bar to the right. Chaos, chaos. Just not a good place to do. Stand up. It's not the environment, but whatever. Businesses, business, selling tickets. I'll put them in the bathroom they want to listen to. Yeah, I wouldn't do that either. I don't like a lot of those music shows too. You got to stand. I'm going to be used later. I'm like, no wonder I got people throwing punches and aerosmith one time because the fucking stand that man. Yeah. You get tired of it after awhile. Now I always dance around. You'll be okay now. At music shows you sit down and then you stand up to you on your feet the whole time. I don't know. I've never been to those things, those music shows or just an excuse for people to get fucking hammered. Go see a bunch of bands. Wander around the desert or wherever the fuck they talking about. Oh, go, go, go. Yeah, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       Just dust bowls and pick and fucking dust out of your teeth and eyes and you've got to camp at three. Then I think Ari camped didn't already do that. He went to Coachella and camp now. Which one was coachella? This is the ones in California. Okay. Yeah, and then the south by southwest was, which is an Austin. There's a bunch of these little music festivals now. I guess it's fun if you go to them. I mean it's gotta be fun. No, it's gotta be fun. You get to see a bunch of different people. You're outside of the few days. You also have to be into it, you know, but like when people want to invite you to those standup ones, do you ever go to stand up festivals? Do you do those? I just did what you did with the Houston one. How was that? Great. Wasn't as is a fairly new one, right?

Speaker 3:          01:53:28       How long have they been doing this one? I think two or three years. Man. Houston used to be a hub. He used to be a hub. Somebody could figure out how to open up that old laptop and river oaks and it's still there. It's still there. That's insane at this. Somebody said, God damn it, I want to look. They filled that. There's so much to tell. That helium guy, that motherfucker would go down there and scoop it up. That was the one of the best rooms ever and nothing's there now? I don't think so. I think that the one club had it for awhile. One club was renting it out and then. Yeah. I don't know what the fuck happened. Yeah. Didn't John Wesley and have something to do with it for awhile? One of those guys. All those guys, but those guys aren't even around no more.

Speaker 3:          01:54:13       I'm like, it's a whole new regime. Wow. Those young guys have. They're running. That festival was a great festival. Had some great names, uh, that Tony Hinchcliffe at red. I mean, we had a great time. They have a scene was like their uh, uh, Houston scene now. Yeah, but they're all younger, younger, like you see the new. I tell you where I went. That's the Houston of 99. Want me to where it is now? Portland, Oregon. Really? Portland, Oregon is the new big. I mean comedy, is that the whole. It's huge right now. Comedy is huge right now. You know, these all these cities have one marquis room to little underground room and those to 100 grand rooms are selling out to laugh factory. Chicago sells out Brian Morton every Saturday it will feature x are at an all time high, but Portland is at an all time fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:55:08       Hi, this is the fourth year in a row. I've been there one or two with you before that. It just keeps getting better and better. And you hear who's collect that. I was there Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Amy was there. She sold that somewhere. I'm fucking 12,000 seats. I don't know what you did on Thursday night. That just proves it's out. It's out in the back when you were in Columbus a few months ago, animal burris and the lead were in town. I mean this is every week and all three shows were selling, you know, 2000 seats. Comedy is at an all time high, but Portland is the Houston have to. You could see it. You could see when people talk to you afterward who they, they come and they talked to you about commonly. Like, I'm coming here to see Segora. I'm coming here to see this guy. I'm coming here to see that guy coming for fucking comedy, man.

Speaker 3:          01:55:58       Yeah. They're smart place. Portland's a smart place and that they appreciate art St. same with Seattle. Seattle's a very smart place. Saddles a notch above La and a lot of ways like when it comes to like, um, smaller community, it's the people a little slicker. They're just not show Biz effected, you know, the more themselves. I shouldn't say slicker, I should say, just smoother. You know what I mean? They're like more themselves, like they're not as affected overall. There'll be a great place if they developed a big scene. I know they got the comedy underground there and that other places. Fantastic. Paula, that's amazing. That same pool halls, they'll pull all connected to it. Really got some other room satellites around, but I mean that's everywhere now from Indianapolis to everywhere. It got some satellite rooms going on comedies. Big Man. Yeah. Comedy is getting big.

Speaker 3:          01:56:51       I mean, helium does a secret show. What's the secret show? They don't know who the headliners. Rarely and they sell out. No Shit. No, no. Philadelphia in Portland, Oregon. Wednesday night you want to do is just call the guy and go, I want the secret show. I want to work out in front of a real. Well, I don't know. She's going to get Joe Rogan people and yet people not job. Wow. Sell out. We don't even know who the headliner is and they know me to do a club. We just know it's going to be one of the guys who's here during the week. I already did it. He sold that. Didn't know what was interesting. Very. That's a great concept. That's a minor risk. That's great. It's going to be one of these 20 cats. You don't know who it's going to be. Strap a pair on just for the show.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       Yeah. Instead of red band secret show, here's the secret Chelan and put 30 people on the poster. Like what's the secret pitch? I'm looking at all the fucking people plus surprise guest. Uh, okay. That's your secret. The secret with him is you don't know. You don't know who the MC is. That's a real feature or the headline. Nobody knows. He just comes up on stage Wednesday night. Wow. Good, good. I did well when you asked, when you have a real reputation, that's when you're telling me that you're just a fan of comedy. You know what? I just want to fucking laugh at you. You're telling me, you know, and I don't really like him. I like him. I didn't really like him. It's also like a real good example of the reputation of the club. Like they trust the club so much. The club as so many headlines connected to it, like real top level headliners that they know that you're in touch with these people all the time and you'll put the right kind of person in that and they do it every week, once a month, once a month.

Speaker 3:          01:58:28       That's a great idea. Yeah. Portland, Seattle, all those Pacific northwest people. It's like, it's a, it's a different vibe up there, you know, that whole, uh, Pacific vibe. It's just a different vibe. I only seeing the sun for two hours. Yeah, three days. The summertime though, they're out. They're out. They're out. Know that. See the summer, it's tough to sell a ticket up there because those motherfuckers got to go camping. Yeah, I got it. They got, they're out there. I'll do a music. They had been, they had been living in like fucking a Jack Nicholson in the shining fucking six months. It rains every goddamn day. I remember Joe saying, Hey, what'd you think about Seattle? So yeah, that was great. She was great. Like Colorado's great until you see waiting for three weeks in a row. Colorado doesn't have that problem though. Whites, one time it did really in 83 fucking Paul Harvey was in the middle of November, yelling, we don't know what's going to happen in Colorado this year.

Speaker 3:          01:59:22       A Paul Harvey, the weather guy, radio guy. He was just talking about the apps in Colorado on all these mountains in Colorado. Empty. We'll let be a snow season bitch. It started snowing on the 20th and it went straight to the December 23rd. Well, you know what? Twenty days in a row and snow is bro. No, you have no idea. Think of leaving for work on a bus. It's snowing. Getting out. It's six. It's snowing. Going home. It's snowing. Going to bed. You wake up. It's still snowing. Two days is cool. Twenty days, 20 days. Snowing, shovelling every. I was shoveling the snow too for awhile, so I'd have to get up and down. I was getting 10, 12 bucks an hour to shower. I didn't give a fuck how deep it again. Eight inches. 12 inches a day. You know how fast the snow comes down in Colorado doors or eight feet?

Speaker 3:          02:00:12       They probably. Yeah, they had. It's like you either pay me now pay me that I don't know what the basis for the fucking bottom of the hill, but they got the snow they needed that year because they man make the hill. The snow on the bottom right there. That helps out. They man make the snow on the bottom I think. Okay, whatever. Whatever that fake snow but snow, they just make it with the machine. They just make it with the machine. Then on top fills in those gaps, but the bottom gives it more of a base. That's what it's called. The base that's so they'll tell you we got a 63 inch base. We have a $200 base. That means you could jump off a fucking helicopter and nothing's going to happen to you in that base. Two of them, it just used to going to land in powder puff.

Speaker 3:          02:00:53       You imagine doing that, going to my arm and get in the helicopter and just jumping off the helicopter with skis and just landing on that fucking thing without your knee blowing the fuck up. Yeah. I saw a guy who did that video. He jumped like 250 feet and went up, fucking landed in the powder and nothing happened. No nothing. It's fine. Fresh Virgin fucking powder. You couldn't take a big chance though. You got to know exactly what's under that spot. Can you imagine landing? That's a fucking Ayesha. When they call. Oh my God. My big icicle goes up. Your asshole or hit a rock on the way down. Ink. Yeah. No, I like, I like bad weather but not three weeks and I fucking in Seattle. I. So I lived there in [inaudible] 95, 96. They get parts. November dog. It just rains for three weeks. Are you worried about global warming in la? Oh yeah. I can't sleep at night. Fuck global warming. It's fucking 44 degrees this morning. I can't. I'm magical. Yeah, it's called in La this morning. Forty four. But then it goes up. Uh, you know, if they talked a lot about global warming. Let me get that half a joint dog over there because this shit fucking turned that on me. Give me one of those fucking. You're a freshman now.

Speaker 3:          02:02:12       Do all your buddies got? Yeah, he gave these fucking strong. He's an animal. He's a fucking animal play games. What were you struggling with when you were talking about yesterday? So it's legal now. $100. I could call him up right now. It's legal. Yeah. I don't know where he's allowed to deliver it to. I think he has to deliver it to somebody that's nowhere near a church or a school or something like that. He's got the stars or two stars at that height. Times. Picking the number three fucking edible. Dude. I never even need a full point for the star of death. I don't even have full point. I leave a little bit. They take a little bit. I take a bite, but I make sure I leave a little bit of the point. Listen to me. There's these new things called cushy 200 milligrams. You open it up. It smells like transmission fluid when you. It's like when you fucking finger somebody but you smelled deepened the monkey. It smells like gunpowder and the pussy St.

Speaker 3:          02:03:08       it smells like transmission fluid in this fucking motherfucker go. You get so fucked up. I love that. Shit. I just pass out now, when I was in Colorado I got some gum, drops, some, a pot gumdrops God, they were so good. Holy Shit. I don't know how many milligrams. Yeah, but each one felt like somewhere around 20. You know, he had a couple of those and they give you a bag that's supposed to be 100 milligrams for how many is in there? Five and their attending or whatever it is. But it's got a kick. It's hard to tell if they're right because I had one and I was like, yeah, this feels like about 10 milligrams now. Another one that was like, Whoa, what the fuck? Like I don't buy that. Have that consistent. I don't think they're doing such a good job at stirring, you know the stars.

Speaker 3:          02:03:59       Last week I was fucking drooling. I called the guy and go and see what the fuck bro. What was in these stores this week? And he goes, well I'm. Sometimes you got a batch is stronger than the other. It's like, wait luge, when I was a kid with Qualia, because people make them in that basement. So something like we talked about sometimes to the table is like this, you know what I'm saying? All this shit goes to the bottom and your fuck. Yeah. And if you get a bag of gummies, you're not necessarily getting them from the same plant. You know what I mean? One, one gummy might be from one batch and another gummy might be for another batch. Like it might not mean they're all getting piled up together. Scooped and put into a bag. You easily could have one live one in their dog. Had an old article about a month ago I found the back of my drawer that they fucked me up.

Speaker 1:          02:04:45       Well that's like an expired vicodin. You ever taken an expired? You won't have paid for a weekend of mouth. I don't care how many root canals they give you. Time expired biking my pants, my wife's, my wife. And watch that tell you about that. A lot of the surgery, surgery, I pop that motherfucking after it was washing detergent. Stronger than ever. I just found it. I found it took one hour with me in case I had tooth pain or no pain. And I never wore those pants again. I go to Portland, I go on the pants and that her, she watched it right before I went onstage. I pop that motherfucking who gives a fuck? I don't need to know anymore. I've been through everything. I do nothing.

Speaker 3:          02:05:35       How strong was it? Oh my God. I picked a half on stage and I blacked out

Speaker 1:          02:05:39       like the first 30 minutes. I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel room seat. The other radio next day.

Speaker 3:          02:05:47       Oh my God. Black the fuck. I didn't know what came out of my mouth. When you on radio, you just start swearing. No, no, no, no. I'm headed to Portland Thursday night. I'm in Portland. I'm getting dressed. When I was pulling pants, these pants are darker than my usual jeans. I never wore. I didn't want. Well last time I wore them was probably when I had the surgery and that's why I found the pill in that it would clean. I went into the detergent, had won the numbers down. She could have been anything. So I just, I slept me not be an answer. I'll eat the whole thing. People give me crazy shit all the time. Let me break this. Maybe somebody gave it to me and I watched over it. I knew it was like a viking cousin for the Vicodin, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          02:06:29       They had to be a cousin or a brother in law, something if I could. If I popped in. I took a half and went to Portland. I walked up those stairs and when I sat down on top of it then I was like, I'm fucked up. I smoked dogs, but I tell you, I set the fire alarm off and put the glove on. Friday night, the fight in the dressing room and the fire department had to come because the whole club blacks out, all the lights go out and the. I had to go onstage and fucking Felicia what up with me? He's just like, do you want me to call up there and check it out? Like, Oh yeah, that's how much of a comedy store chick she is. Like somebody else has said, well, well let's wait till they put the mic on. She's comedy store.

Speaker 3:          02:07:08       She looked at me and said, do you want me to still go up? And I go, fuck. Yeah, and when she got up to the mic turned on. Oh, that's perfect. Perfect. But that just goes to show you the confidence of the comedy store. Did you tell them that you did that? Did you set it off? No, the Co, the MC was onstage. And what I'm saying, he hit bad pain, pain, pain, pain, and the lights are blinking. And when you went up there, he didn't say that was me smoking. Once I got took two hits, I tell them the truth. I just took two

Speaker 2:          02:07:35       fucking heads. Wow. That's a pretty fucking sensitive. Fire alarm was right over me. It was right there. I looked at it afterwards. So the next night they put a little helmet on it. Did they discover oh fuck yeah. They put a little heart without that motherfucker. Hilarious. So it's drastic. It's just a drastic, drastic system. Right. Shut the power off and everything. How about I keep the lights on? What do you think when stampede the fire department came? Looks at the manager and he goes, somebody smoking in the green room. He goes, yeah, he goes out it, we'll set it up and that was it. They didn't give me a ticket or not. And thank God. That's nice. Yeah. A lot of people probably think they can, you know, like especially if you're at a, uh, like any sort of a rock venue like those rock theaters and stuff like that. How many people have probably been smoking in those things forever? Forever. Forever. Fuck. It's probably standard.

Speaker 2:          02:08:29       Portland is an interesting place and the people who live there say it's getting kind of weird because then you're getting a bunch of people that want to live in Portland moving there instead of Portland people. People are like, yeah, I think Portland's kind of my kind of see cameron lives in Eugene Moreau. Yeah. Somewhere in Oregon, right? Yeah. Because one of his neighbors came to the show. Oh really? Yeah, they came to the show. He lives in Eugene, which is like a smaller college town. Have you been there to visit? You like it? Eugene's great. I like it. I like that with good Chinese restaurant there. Quaaludes. I really kind of loons is in Eugene and Roseburg at Roseburg is the one where that's the fucked up one. That's the one where the. They have a strip club, but the waitresses, everything. She used to strip with the DJ. That grown. Man, you got to see this fucking beauty, but are we getting this fucking fun man? Oh, that's a great drive to. I wonder what cow means. I don't know. What it means is a challenge. There's a bunch of different restaurants. There was a balloon. Saugus, Massachusetts. Remember that? Chinese restaurant club? Yeah. Yeah. Was Nick's comedy stop at the Calhoun? I wonder what that means.

Speaker 2:          02:09:35       It goes to city. A city. Oh, okay. Like New York, like it's like saying Hollywood. Is it like saying like the Hollywood restaurant, the Hollywood grill, the Hollywood diner. That's a funny thing, right? That word Hollywood. Like people like to use that word. It's the northern part of Hong Kong. Oh, no, shit. They ain't go to. Maybe it's like a style of cooking or something, but yeah, that was the cow loon and Sagas. Great Place. Great Comedy Club. How Far Sagas from the city? I don't remember whether it couldn't have been too long. Were there a couple and it was run by Lenny's brother. There was. No, that was giggles lady brother, brother Mike Clark ran a place called giggles and uh, that Guy Mike Clark gave me more headline and gigs, like when I was struggling than probably anybody. He had always had great rooms. Always had a restaurant here or dive there, a bar there and always got you good money. It was cool. It was fun too because you, you travel around all these weird spots. Do Comedy and sometimes people would hire comedians and it wouldn't work out. They would try it for one show and you'd be on that one show and then they never had comedy again. It was such a dirty comedians from Boston come up in some weird fish restaurant in New Hampshire and they just don't want to just don't like it. How many of those did we do? Thousands. Thousands. Had to.

Speaker 1:          02:11:04       I used to do comedy in a place where it was alive. Parrot behind John Stayed Two, three feet. He would eat the seeds and fucking flick them up. In the end. There's so many things that you've done that you were talking about comedy. You have this grand illusion of comedy when you get into it and you get to this place and it's not a stage. There's no green room guy talks to you like you're shit. You're like, why do I do this? You know, my 12 and I got to go to work at six. So fucking tough. But it's not a, it's not really a, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:11:41       it also doesn't seem that hard when you look at it from the outside the first time you look at it, like that's not that hard. It's just people talking like, I'll figure that out. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:11:54       until you bomb 800 fucking times. But that's part of it. Like now sometimes I get happy when I bombed because I get it out of the what? Yeah. At least it's not a fucking surprise anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:12:07       Yeah. That's the best motivator to like tighten up your game. The best motivators are shitty. Said. It's nothing like one offset just feels. Just wanting to get back and tighten things down. It's interesting to people that go to the store on a regular basis too, because they get to see all the development. They'll see a bit one time and then they'll come back and see you maybe six months later and they'll see it again. But now it's got all these extra things going on. It's alive. It's connected to other. To get into it better. You're smoother in your delivery. So much fucking fun. The CSO thing, you shot in Chicago? Uh, in Rosemont, Illinois, right? You shot it pretty recently. October 15th. That's real recent and it comes out tomorrow. How fired up you?

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       I'm happy it's old. There's a lot of fucking work. It wasn't. Yeah, it was fun though. It was really fun. You know, it was the first time I have a tape, my spouse, myself, I can't stand looking at myself and I can't stand listening to myself and I don't know which one is worse, you know? I never said nothing to nobody, but I saw Johnny Depp on Letterman and let him and was like, so all the dailies. Luckily he's like, bitch, I don't look at them and let them. It's like, what the fuck are you talking about? He goes, I don't look at Shit. I don't go to the premiere of my movies. I don't look at myself. And he goes, why not? I lunch and I felt a lot better, but this was the first time he said he hated looking at themselves. This I don't like it.

Speaker 1:          02:13:37       You don't want me to say is um, when I first got here January 29th and like two weeks later it was super bowl and I got talked into going on with these goofy active parties. I didn't know I was at the store. I was at the store and some goofy guy came up and he goes, you want to go to the superbowl party? And I went there and I'll never forget this as long as I fucking live in the middle of the fucking super bowl. Like, you know when it ends the first quarter, then you have the show in the middle and Michael Jackson, which saying or whatever. Right in front of 60 people, a person put a demo reel. I will never forget that my whole life. Like it was not supposed to be in that. Like some guy came in and go, it's time yet. Hold on. I don't know for my demo reel when Shit, you found anything and they popped that demo reel in for 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          02:14:28       You Watch student films and fucking college films and I think he had like one spot that was tv and I'll never forget how embarrassing. Like I felt embarrassed for the guy. Like let's watch my demo reel. Are you fucking kidding me? To a room full of other actors? 60. Oh my comedian. Stand up comics, you know, so called man. I Dunno, I would just been here for two weeks. So I don't like looking at none of this shit. This was the first time I actually went home and fucking tape sets. Like I didn't know how to do nothing on this fucking phone. And I went home and tape fucking sets and had to listen to them and write notes and I realized the process there was shit. I was letting go at night like you come up to and go, that's a good bit. But you didn't tell me about the two things before that.

Speaker 1:          02:15:18       I said that comes after a set. It's really hard to remember what it was. Funny. I don't know why that is, but you remember one or two lines, but you didn't remember those two fluctuations you set in your voice. Those are the things I never worked on before. That line that you threw away, that was the setup to that joke and you don't even know you set it up with that. That's what this taught me. This special taught me that type of shit. I had to listen to every fucking set man. And you know what? It's funny how you prepare jokes and you think what's going to work. And then when you listen, the ship that you thought was gonna work doesn't really work as well. It's little things that you didn't think was going to work. That really worked. It's so weird when you listen to your material and it was a whole complete different education. For me. It was rough for me to do. It was really tough for me to do because I didn't like listening to myself at night. I would do it on planes when you can't go anywhere. When I'm trapped I get really fucking high. I pull one of these pads out and just go on a train on the plane. I'm sorry. In fact, you know what happened to me. I pulled out my third seat. Deanna. Plane out of Chicago is the worst thing I ever heard in my fucking life, but my cd is

Speaker 3:          02:16:29       probably the worst thing I've ever heard in all my life. I can't believe I haven't really used it, but that's when I learned that there's a lot of jokes in times that even if you think even [inaudible] there's seven minutes, you're like enough with the shit. There's still three more, four more minutes in that thing. When I beat and you taught me that you will. The one that said you liked to keep finding tags and stuff. You know, sometimes you just get tired, you just go, fuck it. I got four of them on there, I'm going to move on. So that's what I found that out. That's what shocked me about this. It was the first time I had really done this type of exclusive work, Bro. CSOS putting out some good shit. You Doug, who else are they doing? Brian? Bryan County. In fact, I'm doing radio.

Speaker 3:          02:17:13       I'm calling radio tomorrow and Brian zombies in Florida. This is Brian's last one. Did they buy his last one on one with them? I'm not sure. I know either got released last week and I'm not sure either I or reissue or something. See. So uh, so cecil was owned by NBC, is that what it is? Yes. That's interesting. They're doing that. Look, it's great when someone's doing any. I mean the more people doing something like that, the better. Like I said, man right now commonly used to be eight to 12 or eight to two. Now it's nine to five because people are on their desks with ear buds on. Yeah. They could dream your fucking special at work. There's so much going on with streaming and the whole fucking deal. Well, most of the people that listen to this are working right now. I'm working on right now.

Speaker 3:          02:17:58       Probably. I would imagine if you're doing something that you don't have to be listening to somebody. You could listen to this while you're doing your work. Nine to five, nine has shown any Goddamn I got to stop coughing. The fuck's going on. I ended up five has so many amazing. You know from TV. Used to be from eight to 11. Yeah. Pretty much working people only watch television from eight to 11. That's changed. Now. I go to work now at nine and put it buds on and I can't get into game of thrones or Westworld, but I can listen to a here. How many people do you think get to listen to stuff while they work? A lot. A lot. What percentage? I T I don't know about it. A lot of tech people. Yeah. A lot of tech people. When I talk to my knees sometimes in Jersey, she tells me I was to you in the office and she's in marketing.

Speaker 3:          02:18:50       You know, it puts these in and make notes and type of proposals and listening to podcasts. It's a whole game out. That's not eight to 11 no more. That thing is that now? Yeah, eight till 11. Netflix is a whole new realm now. You know. Now I could go to work and listening from nine to 12 and from one to five and I could watch from 12 to one at my desk. I could watch game of thrones on Netflix. I can watch. It's a different fucking world out there. Do you use a use Netflix and use apple TV? Do you ever use that? No. That's what we're getting because the speakers on my. I was fantastic. I didn't know what my wife is saying. I don't understand of that stuff. She does

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       all the it stuff at the house. It's just crazy that you can see. You know what I mean? Ninety nine or whatever the hell it is. Percentage of the movies just by the right. They're like, I don't know what percentage. I shouldn't say 99. Let's take a guess. It's probably not even 10 percent. What percent of all movies are on itunes because independent movies probably aren't. Maybe some independent movies, all movies on itunes a lot. I don't think all of them because the other day I noticed that they just recently added an American Werewolf in London and I was like, oh wow. How weird was it? The wolf man, one of those. Now when we told them on Netflix, this is apple TV. Then they recently added some other movies that were like pretty old movies, like they just. They just added them, so I think they're still buying movies and putting them on me.

Speaker 2:          02:20:19       I don't know how they're doing licensing them, whatever they're doing, making some sort of a deal, but they got a lot of fucking movies is my point. The crazy thing is you could just press it and it starts playing. Like when we were kids. It's just the idea of going to the store. You got make member have blockbuster would have those giant shelves filled with one kind of movie. One movie would come out and that movie would just feel a shelf and like say if it was like a transformers or alien or something like that, there would be, you know, three, four levels of them and you would, you would get there and they don't want to be a couple left and you get lucky. Oh God, we got the last, last alien. Yeah, bring it back. That's what I, that's the first time I went in.

Speaker 2:          02:21:02       There was a night I was running from the cops. After I kidnap Vela, I want the blockbuster and I, and above the law, these people kept telling me, you gotTa Watch, watch this Guy Steven Seagal. I'm like, I don't want to do it. I watched above the law and lethal weapon. I'd never seen lethal weapon before. That's a good movie for the time. If I watched it too, that probably get angry. I watched the triangle scene at the end. Like a mad catch. Mel Gibson used a triangle. Doesn't even close it on the Chinese. A guy with them two sponges. No, it wasn't in. Um, yeah. Lethal weapon. Do the check. Was it the gas guy? He's hanging in. The guy's hitting them with the sponges and the guy. That's right. That's right. He triangles and. No, and then he triangles. Guy On grass guy we fuck with the guy who got into a motorcycle accident. PUC Puc. Yeah. It was Gary Busey, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a shitty triangle. Choke to. He doesn't cinch it up. And this is like when the cops were there, they kind of let them go after it. Right. Because this was like these guys so crazy. The cops let them fight. Let them go with sticks. Mel Gibson was shredded son. That's her motherfucking caboodle. Time for this shit. Look at him.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       Yeah. Mel Gibson, if people will forget, was a fucking accident star. He was a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          02:22:32       Boom. We get slammed on a cop car. This is so ridiculous like that this could ever happen or cops would let some bad guy duke it out with the cop because they knew that the cop was such a bad ass. He's eventually gonna kick this de Gaulle's today. Thirty years ago this shit was happening. Do you think so they let dudes do like as a friend who called out a compliment and fought in front of three other cops. Well, he just said you wouldn't do this shit without your tough friends. Take off the fucking badge and the gun. Bitch. Why are we doing this? Take it off. You're not going to do it. And then he goes, yes, I am. Guy Looked like Phil Sims. We were like in high school, we were maybe a year in high school when Phil Sims a beat cop for one of my friends on the street to other cops.

Speaker 3:          02:23:15       They're like six of us there. Who One? My friend. Fuck them up. Really my friend. Fuck them up. That's how crazy it was. Why are we doing this? You don't like me, I don't like you. Forget the arrest and let's drill down right here. You will. Tough guy. Motherfucker put off the gun. So after he beat his ass with a cop, do they fucking shook hands and then it will fuck with each other again. Wow. I mean, he didn't throw him around, but he punched him in the fucking mouth a few times in front of his buddies.

Speaker 3:          02:23:44       Oh, that's weird. And one time when I got, when I got out of the fucking jail in Boulder, I got out of the halfway house and I got into a fight with a guy that cut me off and they ended up splitting up the car and something happened, Bro. I slipped and that guy had me. He was beating the fuck out of me, but then he slipped in the snow. So when the cops got there, I was on. They pulled this up. I was going back to prison. I thought they were going to violate me. I told the cop what happened. He told the cop what happened, but he was giving the cop a bad attitude I want right there. He was telling me, what the fuck do you care? And the guy goes, hey, awesome. They talked and they pull us back. I just told the cop the truth.

Speaker 3:          02:24:23       I just got to the halfway house. I can't get violated for this. Go talk to this guy. And they came back and I go, we're not going to press charges but shake hands. And the guy goes, I'm not going to shake his hand. And the cop looks at me, looks at them. He goes, you know what? When we got here, you weren't doing too fucking good. Okay. Don't make me. Don't make me put him on fucking top. You'll get you weren't doing too fucking good. Shake his hand. The guy shook my hand. That was the end of that. We got it. You weren't doing it through good cops letting people fight. It's strange. You remember there was that thing that was going on in the California prisons where they haven't liked these, these crazy fights, these underground fights and the guards were like setting things up. The gladiator fights. Remember that? There was like a big article about it. We should. I don't know if we let at days. Next time you see Mike Dyson, you should have asked them before like shoes. True. See what he says to you that they based that movie with fuck. Go on him. That was the story that somebody, they let the board

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       and leave town for Christmas and one of the guys got in touch with to promote and they brought somebody from boxing and to see Mike Tyson. Come on. That's what I got the fucking idea for that movie. Let me go. Come on. Undisputed. Let me. Excuse me. Let me go ahead and pick that kid. Undisputed is based on a real story. They brought a guy in the prison. Come on. Do you know how, how much that would be worth when prison guards force inmates to fight? That was the wide. You. Uh, what are you googling? Undisputed movie real? Is it based on a real story? Wow. Movie similarities to real life. Tyson's saga. Undisputed. But where is the fight that he didn't have a fight in jail? If Mike Tyson had a fight in jail, they would have, they would have filmed that and Mike Tyson would be talking about it.

Speaker 2:          02:26:22       Mike Tyson has that whole story. You know, where your, his whole live show where he talks about his entire life. I mean, if Mike Tyson had that in his life, he will be telling people about it. Don't you think? I mean, I can imagine that he would ever have a fight in jail and not tell anybody about it. I think the. Well, what was it about it? What are you looking up? Jamie Center for? Um, someone was asking the same question as a boxing for them. So yeah, maybe someone's got a link somewhere. People are silly. There's no links. You would have heard of it. We've known there was a video of Tyson fighting in jail. Come on. And she for sure you're going to tape. It was just going to let it happen. Trust your memory. You're going to bring in riddick bow or someone like that. And you're gonna. Have Tyson fight him in jail. The Fuck Outta here. That's ridiculous. Early nineties. Mid Nineties. I don't remember the exact day. When. What year do you think Tyson was in jail? Tyson went to jail. A 2000. Two thousand 11 around there. No, that was, that was the more recent one, right? Wasn't the real Chicago and Illinois. I think it was the late nineties because he was out. He was out and fighting holy field while I was living in Encino, which I think was 96.

Speaker 2:          02:27:42       Yeah, I think. When did he go in? He got arrested in [inaudible] 92 that says you got a six year prison term. Yeah, that was the one. It was awesome. It was. That's what it was. How long was Tyson in jail for? He still maintains that of all the shit he says that, that that's, that doesn't happen. Yeah. That was set up, which is really crazy. Then you find out that that same woman had set somebody else up. She had lied about a, another one. Another. Uh, alleged rape allegedly lied. I don't know the specifics, but that was in her past, like, whoa. You just

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       released a winter in March. March 26. Ninety two. He was sentenced. He was released march. [inaudible] 95. Three years? Yeah, three years. How long has he been retired? He retired right after. Well, he had a couple of fights, but I think it was the Kevin Ferguson fight. Was that the one where you retired? Was his last fight. Tyson's done the boxing world by quitting before the start of the seventh round against Kevin Mcbride. Kevin Mcbride. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:28:56       That's what it was. And uh, you know, the Lennox Lewis fight was a bad beating two. That was before that. That was one where you look, you knew like, oh, he's just not the same guy anymore. You know, you go back and watch the guy that destroyed Larry Holmes. It was a scary guy. Then you know, he knew as much as anybody knew, can only go so long in that business. It's just, is a shelf life. Nobody gets out. You know, it's a fun time for boxing right now. Been paying attention to boxing

Speaker 3:          02:29:30       belly up time for what I got on my plate. Now I got to open up boxing. You Know Bernard Hopkins is fighting? No. Yup. Yup. Fifty, 50 1:51. He's fighting December 17th. Where in La? It's fight at the forum.

Speaker 2:          02:29:48       Yeah. Who's he fighting? Some. A young, tough light. Heavyweight white dude. Knockout power will say barnard is so hard to hit. He's so clever. I don't think he'd be fighting if he wasn't still capable to. He looked at him like right here, come on, man. Fifty one years old and he looks fucking great. Like, look at this. Who's combinations? Right?

Speaker 5:          02:30:15       I mean,

Speaker 2:          02:30:20       I mean everything looks smooth as fuck, man. That's, that's the real Bernard Hopkins. When you're looking at him boxing here, you're not saying, oh, this is a 51 year old Bernard Hopkins. You're saying that's Bernard Hopkins.

Speaker 3:          02:30:35       Oh Joe, 51. Your reactions, your vision. There's a lot of other factors. Oh, for sure. There's a lot of the factors, but this is amazing. Oh, it's amazing. It's amazing that you could even consider that this guy at 51 years old should be allowed to fight professionally. There's also very smart. He was. You've pointed out a lot of stuff. To me, he was always very smart. He never really got hit a lot. He didn't get in any big, big, big, big people, you know. I mean, this guy always stayed pretty clean. It's not like he's a Jeffrey Jeff, you know? Yeah. I know. He would make fights ugly. He would clench a lot, frustrated a lot of guys, but he also could crack, you know, and he just was a really boxer. The the big coming out party for him was Felix Trinidad when he fought Felix Trinidad and just boxes face off.

Speaker 3:          02:31:26       Everybody just saw like wow. Like we thought Felix Trinidad was this young hungry lion. He was taken on the older veteran who is probably on his way down to Bernard Hopkins, wasn't on his way down like he's just, he was just like coming into his own stride then, but he's always been so disciplined, man so smart with his diet. So smart with how he takes care of his body. Never allows himself to get out of shape. So he's never like working back into shape and always fights intelligent and defensively he's always in the right position to work for him. That's why I 51, it might work for very well could. He's working out with John David Jackson, who was a two division world champ, I believe. I think he was at least one division champ, but John, David Jackson and a lot of people forgot about it was a really high level voxer and like, uh, like the nineties.

Speaker 3:          02:32:18       This guy here. Yep. Yeah. John. David Jackson. He looks familiar. He works with Sergei Cova love him and Sergey Kovalev work together. So that was a, that was another guy that he trains. He trains. He's like one of the most respected up and coming trainers particularly because he achieved a world championship level, you know, when he was boxing, he was really high level guy. He uh, used to work out with Terry Clay Bond, you know Terry Cleveland as to what's really going on. That guy. I love that dude. He said it's some gym in Hollywood, I guess to stop by say hi to. I saw justin fortune. How's that guy doing? Cancer could suck his dick though. What happened? He had cancer for a while, but I touched them. Yes. I think he beat the fuck out it though, Pete. The last night when I drove around, but I was really in shock when I hugged him.

Speaker 3:          02:33:14       He Salad Bowl. I mean, you could tell he lost 20 pounds. He was doing chemo. He said, I know I didn't ask him, but pro kind of cancer. Was it like something Roy? The sunlight, some thyroid or something, something like that. But man, when I hugged them yesterday I was like, this guy got cancer. God Damn God damn well you know, they're way better at taking care of cancer now than I've ever been. Like hitting a wall. I hadn't seen him in a year. I could never count them go to Hollywood that much. So yes, I was driving and he's always training packy out. He's in the Philippines when I call it six, I'm up. I'll try to call. I even set them. I call. So when he's training, package out how to him and Freddie Roach work stuff out that go down there. So. But what is, what is the difference between like what he does and what Freddy does? I think he just does strengthen fitness. Oh, okay. Okay. And Freddy does the myths and everything else. But Justin was one of the first guys were his gym I ever saw. He had like an altitude box.

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       Yes. I was like, what? You go in the box and it simulates high altitude and you fucking go crazy and workout in there. Yes. Like that's, that's high level. I mean he had like a, it was a vacuum attached to it or something like that that was sucking the air out of there. So it was like a very low oxygen state. Simulators used to be in the corner. They moved. I didn't see it yesterday, but man, when I hugged them, mess that, I was like, oh fuck this guy still solid. Oh Shit. I'm really interested in seeing Bernard Hopkins fight this weekend. I'm really interested in. No. Next week. Next weekend. Really interest you in town. No, no. I'm going to have to watch it on the road, but a 17th going somewhere. Joe Diaz. Are you doing comedy? No job. I ain't going to bother. I ain't got a creepy question. This sucker. I just thought you were doing comedy. Somebody didn't know you wanted to set their next gig. Booked a past our gig on New Year's December 31st. Then I don't have anything booked until Portland that was working on new shit. Um, what about uh, in Toronto Friday you have no show. Oh yeah, yeah, we do it. Yeah. It's me, Russell Peters and big Jay Oakerson.

Speaker 2:          02:35:31       That's fucking, that's like one of those festivals. Yeah. We sold out Massey Hall and like an hour. It was pretty quick. It was pretty quick. What's Massey whole feet? 3,000, 2,800, something like that? No, just one. Just one. Just one to have some fun. It was, you know, Russell did the podcast. We were just joking around or like we should do a show together. I'm like, let's book something man. And then I'm like, I'm going to do Massey Hall. You want to do it with me? He's like, fuck it, I'll do it. And then boom, it was in. And then I've talked to big j. You know, actually maybe I talked to big j first. Asked big j first. Yeah. I asked big j first because he told me was going to be in town for the fights. He wanted to get tickets to the fight. So I go, fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:36:10       I'm like, what are you doing Friday night? And he wasn't doing anything. I'm like, C'mon man, let's work. It tells for fun. That place is awesome. Oh yeah. The Beatles played there. Man. That place has an energy. 3,000 seats, the fucking Beatles. But Hey man, they did whatever the fuck they wanted. The Beatles could do whatever they wanted. They could play 3000 seeds. They it a paid arenas. I think they probably did everything. And I got to Boogie three please. I gotta tell you this, wrap this shit up. No, we tell to wrap this up. When I heard this story, I was like, I don't want to hear this and I'm not gonna Watch it. Listen, he would call me a bunch of names and shit and I probably won't say nothing to you. Don't fuck with me. When it comes to music and the argument by restaurants, that's what gets under my fucking core. Okay. I hate it. I hate the band. I don't like a fucking band. Okay. When I was growing up in Jersey, I got a call. When did it go see? Twisted sister and I'm like, that's the bad. With the makeup, like makeup. I went with this Italian dude that

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       had no fucking. He had. He had no tolerance for bad music. Me and him a perfect because we walked out of movies together with perfect for each other. We walked in, I'll never forget this guy came in and goes, what? Twisted fucking sister man, and we looked at each other and we ran out. Never again will, I think it was the sister dog watched a documentary on twisted sister the more than most. I knew there was selling 9,000 tickets, no 14,000 tickets a week and nobody would sign them as a band. I mean that God awful. God awful. That music local, but they became huge and nobody would sign them to fucking assistance would come up to the president of the label and go dog twisted system and he goes, the next person will talk to me about twisted assistant. I will fucking fight. I do not like these guys sold so many, but it was like for you to understand this, you have to understand.

Speaker 3:          02:38:18       I think I was talking about all this shit you did when you did comedy. Do you know that Dee Snider Guy is jacked Jack, Jack, Jack, and somebody picked a fight with him somewhere or something like that. Either someone picked a fight with him or there was a guy who looked exactly like dee snider will beat the fuck out of some dude. I forget which one. It's one of those. It's either it's either I got fooled and they revealed they were revealed that it was a guy that looked just like I'm gonna. Kick some dude's ass, but there was A. is this him? Is this him or not? See this guy sucker punches him and he beats the fuck out of this dude. Look at him. He slams down on the ground. He body slammed him. Beats the shit out of them. Is that Dee Snider? 10? But it comes up when you google them, like when you Google Dee Snider fight. Dude, if it is dee snider has specked respect. He beat the fuck out of that dude. That dude sucker punched him. He body slammed him. Kick the shit out of him. The guy was still talking shit, so he walked up on him again.

Speaker 3:          02:39:22       I mean this guy sucker punched him. He beat the shit out of him if that is him. It's not that unlike these slides. I don't like that. I mean I just didn't like the music, but after I watched his documentary, Joe, I fucking like, I still don't like the music that I like. I'm going to rock. What does it will go? They'll rock. Even that right there is great. That right there. That's tremendous. That's, that's the opening line of data. But it was pretty fucking interesting. They were doing like Long Island, Wednesday, Jersey, 3000 seats on Thursday, another 3000 seats on Friday in the metropolitan area and then 5,000 on Saturday and no one would sign them. Nobody. That's incredible. And every time they were going to get signed, something else happened. Like one guy came, it was an asylum. He got on the plane, died of a heart attack.

Speaker 3:          02:40:15       The other time they were going to play the garden or something. They sold that something. Don't quote me on this. They sold that something big and Manhattan, 5,000 seats every a and R guy was going to come and the drummer got a fucking infection. He couldn't play the drums for four days. I mean it was just like they kept getting kicked in the fucking ass. Boom, boom. And finally one day signed them and the rest happened. But it's pretty fucking interesting, man. Even though you may not like him, I didn't think much of me that I liked them when I was a kid. I liked a bunch of their songs. I'm sure about one of the records. That guy's a radio hosts now, isn't he? I'm not sure. I know he was. I know I called them to his radio station. Wants these. Snyder was a long ass time ago. Yeah, it was really cool. It was crazy. It was crazy just to talk to dee snider. I'm like, I'm talking to him. I don't remember. I called him, I call magic radio show. One time I called them. I'm talking to this guy and after 10 minutes I realized this is the guy that's saying a lot. I was in jeopardy. Oh baby. And he had something else too. What the fuck was his name? Do you remember? Alto. Nova.

Speaker 3:          02:41:19       It's just a fantasy. Put the video on with the video. Can we end with the video please?

Speaker 3:          02:41:28       Do you remember the video? Yes, I do remember the beginning of it. What to play a little bit of it, but we can't play any of the music for the people at home. We'll just watch it for us. Yeah. After the beginning of that, life is just a fantasy. I still remember what I see though in this video permit. New Year's eve of 1982 or three volume young Jamie. Look at this. Wow. This is 83. Whoa. That's one of the crazy things about really good video. Like this is, you know, you see these people. This is a time capsule. This is people from the eighties. You know, they talk about how music isn't selling anymore. Maybe you guys don't. They don't do these goofy things. Look at this. Well, it's because the only way to get music back then was you got to buy it. That's not the case anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:42:20       It's pretty easy to get music now. Now it's about making it convenient to people. There's Aldo motherfucking Nova with a leopard leisure suit on bitch. What? Look at him. Handsome motherfucker. He hopped out demons. Say Hi to anybody where there's leopard. Didn't even acknowledge the fact. Yeah, I got a leopard skin leotard. What? You know? He's still around Alto Novis. Just a songwriter now. Oh Man. Well you can't take this away from my watch. This shit. This is a. they're breaking down this door to get into this warehouse and I'll don't know if it takes his guitar out. It gets better, Dude. Everybody stand back. He's going to shoot the wall with his guitar. Look at the laser cuts through the door with his guitar laser. Here it comes, baby.

Speaker 6:          02:43:11       Don't

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       fast forward to that part. Either. Suffer, suffer to get to this suffering to get to the song. No, you don't remember this dude Jamie, because you spend too much time on black twitter. Okay? Wearing yeezys. Look at them. Did look at him. Go up there. Here it goes. You don't even know this song to you. Here we go, baby. Jamie's looks the look at Jamie's face. Put the camera on you. Can you put the camera on you? Look at your face. That's a legitimate reaction to hearing Aldo Nova in 2016 for the first time. Come on Bro. Look at that. He's got a scarf on. So leather scarf, like a snake. Skin leather is really. Have a scarf. Does he?

Speaker 5:          02:44:01       No.

Speaker 3:          02:44:07       Look at that outfit. The leopard print.

Speaker 3:          02:44:11       It's beautiful. This song is hypnotic. Tell me it's not bringing you in. Bringing you back. What were you like five when this came out? You even born. You were you 83. Beginning 83. You're born in 83. So this is your baby. Your baby. Then when Jamie was born, this is probably playing a joke and tell them if they go to Cecil Csun, they're pressing joey. They get two months for free. Oh, okay. I get this special for free. Free free tomorrow. So Joey and you'd done for Free Foot Julian. That's the Code Joey for two months for free. Get on at folks. Let's blow the shit up.
