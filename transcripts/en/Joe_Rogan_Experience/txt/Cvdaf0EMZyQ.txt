Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Ladies and gentlemen, this is unprecedented occurrence here. Josh Barnett was on his way and not only did he run into ridiculous traffic, but Josh is so gangster. He drives a 1969 automobile around and unfortunately got a flat tire. He drove that bitch all the way up because it work on. You could throw that pitch all the way from Orange County. You do that on a regular basis.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Yeah, I bought the thing to be a daily driver, you know, and uh, I got kind of tired of how. I mean I don't drive anything passionless, but I just want to drive an old car. I, I just, I liked the simplicity of it. I like the noise. I like the feel of it. So. And plus it's not, it's not anything super special. It doesn't have a bunch of fancy motard outbreaks and all. No, it's all pretty much old school technology. I know exactly what I'm dealing with and stuff breaks. I can fix it. Not a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:00:49       You don't, it doesn't bother you. The, it takes a long time for those things to slow down. Trying to brace, uh, you gotta account

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       for that. This is true. Um, I don't know. I'm used to driving old cars all my life. I've driven a lot worse than this and I do have a, I have a rear disk conversion kit, so it will be four wheel disc brakes. It's still going to take way longer to stop and say my challenger, but I'm okay with that.

Speaker 3:          00:01:13       Yeah. Once he drive a modern version of a muscle car, like, oh, why can't you just do this with a better interior? Why can't you do this with like an old school interior? Like make it like that. It's just, I like a car that can start, like when you want to start it and start start. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       My color turns right over every single time. Just go boom. Just goes. Just super, super clean. So it's runs great. It's 100 percent reliable. It's that it is 100 percent reliable and I'm putting a, a overdrive tranny in it. I'm doing things here. Things are. And uh, it will be. I just want basically a high 14 second quarter mile car that you can drive everywhere and never. Yeah. And See I can't even enough alone. It's got. It's got a peg leg in it right now, so I got to put a pause unit in it. That just has to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:02:00       You are, you like the quintessential boy turned man metal music cage fighting muscle cars. It's all of the quintessential manly type shit

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       somebody ever asked me like, so. So what are you really good at? Doing manly shit. Making manly faces while I do manly shit. Like I can, I can look inquisitive and I can stare off in the distance and I can hold a cigar in my mouth and I can. I can put grease in the right places.

Speaker 3:          00:02:29       Yeah. You gotta cover all as a whole manly repertoire.

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       Yeah. Which is good because it offsets, you know, all the Times that I'm wearing panties,

Speaker 3:          00:02:38       it offsets the society too as a distinct lack of manliness going on. It does the uh, the boobs are not just on the women anymore. Yeah, it's not, you know, there's a lot of that. There's a lot of, a lot of, you know, men are giving into what women like because if you don't, you get labeled, you know, you, if you like all the shit that you like, you get labeled, you like you're a chauvinist, your uptake, there's something wrong with you. You're a meathead, you're a metal head. Know what, uh, you get labeled as being someone you know, undesirable or slightly immature.

Speaker 2:          00:03:11       I know, I love the fact that, uh, so I blamed skinny jeans for all that. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:03:19       skinny jeans are ridiculous. If you can't sprawl in your pants, then you shouldn't be wearing them. If you couldn't throw it, at least a body kick and your pants, you shouldn't be wearing them. You shouldn't be wearing something that you have to struggle to get out of or in that shits they're seeing maybe those

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       chuck norris karate pants, the karate denims with a gusset crotch. We'll come back in to round out anybody in the face. No problem. We need to get like a true religion version of the Chuck Norris Jeans. Like they need to combine forces, club pants, high kicks with the ultimate. The ultimate Ninja Douche bagger. Oh, could you imagine just the commercials we guys throwing roundhouse kicks with their, with their foot slip on shoes and our fucking heavily monogrammed glittery shirts. Throw, throw in karate, roundhouse kicks. But uh, as far as like labels like I been labeled all my life. I wasn't a nerd, a Dork and I was an outcast kid, you know, and I liked weird shit like foreign films and Gore movies and anime and comic books and we'd go to the race track with my family and classic cars and just all kinds of weird fucked up shit were, you know, I could. I'm captain of the football team but nobody else knows what the fuck I what tip I'm on. They're just going, dude, you're a Weirdo.

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       Is this where you always attracted to being into shit that was like away from the crowd or is that just the stuff that you liked? Both. Both.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       I mean, I, I grew up in that weird era where cable came about and so they would fill the airways full of whatever cheap shit they could get. And that ended up being a lot of weird shit, a lot of weird shit from, from Japan, from everywhere. And then I had a fixation with horror movies as a kid and that lead to other places, you know, all of a sudden the cycle Friday the 13th is cool, but I didn't really get to see that head get crushed. So where, where can I pick that up at? You know, what movies got that in it. So yeah, the faces of death. Did you get into all that? Actually I was more into like the Italian, like full cheese Zombie movies and stuff or they're horrible and the dubbing is the worst ever. But you know, people are like vomiting out their insights, you know, vaginas start talking and eating things, whatever. If that's a movie, you should probably see it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:36       And there was a whole series in like, I guess it was the sixties and the seventies of just what they would call Gore movies. What movies were unbelievably gory. Like I remember I picked up a magazine about at once. It just, you know, it was one of those just looking through random magazines like what the fuck is his, like Fangoria, and it was all about one type of

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       Gore film at this one duties to make it

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       herschell Gordon Lewis, stuff like that hasn't maniacs. And I think that's it. And uh, the wizard of Gore. Yeah. And so he came out, he, when they were making like these, I think they're x rated at the time, they weren't hardcore but like these, these exploitation films at one point, and then it was like, that wasn't enough. So they created this movie. They showed people getting their tongues cutoff and I mean they're really cheesy, so bad, but still starving, but back then it really fucked people's minds up. Yeah. And uh, and that was, you know, that was just, that was their new thing. All of a sudden the audience was flipped out about it and they had to get more of it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Yeah. I remember seeing that as a little kid going, woo, fuck wants to wash this. Like this is just disturbing. Like I understand a good Zombie movie, a good vampire movie, you know, something fun. Well, who the fuck wants to watch people just get chopped up like that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       That's a lot of people know with the, uh, with you've got the whole, um, what was that? Uh, Eli Roth thing, a torture film. But they had. Oh yeah. Which I can't remember. They've done. Two of them I think were the travelers end up in Romania and then they get into some place by hobbits. Hostile. Hostile. Yeah. Yeah. I only saw the first one. Right. And then, and then of course even the rich people will pay to the court. But honestly, really it's all the women's fault. The chicks lured them in those course. Vagina ruins lives. They, it certainly can, you know, you go up for a piece of strange and you get a fucking splinters shoved into your eye. That's what happens. It can happen. No. And there's no protection for that. Like they don't make a condom for that one.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       No. You, you fought all over the world, right? I mean, if you're a fun Russia, I have never fallen Russia. Um, do you ever hear he's hearing this description of going to the hospital and it looked like dawn of he dead bodies laying out there and just stitching people up in front of you and you're like, what the fuck is going on man? Love bodies like laying on, on like vodka probably for an antiseptic. Yeah. And that was during the dark age when the, uh, the Soviet Union collapsed. So I think times were really fucking hard there for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       I'm sure there's still some of that to be found over in Russia because it's such a difference. And, and class at this point it's like the uber rich and then there's not, not really a middleclass to my understanding people. That's why I'm moving like hostile works because you know, you look at these pretty girls and you're like, if they were really cold hearted killers from Russia, they could sneak you in, pull your butt cheeks apart until you died. I wonder if they really are that people that are willing to pay people to go about thinking about all the perverted shit that we think about. Right. And then we go and then we go look up and watch on the Internet while masturbating, so to speak for yourself. Some of us, some of us are easily amused. Uh, but the thing being is that you can think of all kinds, fucked up, weird fetish and there is at least a handful of people out there. They're going to do it. Anything you can imagine someone's doing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       I just couldn't imagine someone being able to organize a place where you could actually go to torture people. I feel like somebody is going to tell this. This is good. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       Fall apart. I just, I don't, I don't put anything past humanity is the most fucked up thing. And the most beautiful thing is easily as one of the other.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Have you ever seen the Bohemian Grove footage? Do you know anything about Bohemian Grove? No. It sounds like a bunch of hippies. No, just the opposite. A bunch of like banker type dudes and a dignitaries from foreign countries and, and like skull and bones type dudes. They get together and who knows what the fuck is really going on? But they have this giant Molek, the owl God, and they all dress up in robes. It's ridiculous. I mean, it's been proven that there's a secret.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Sounds like larping, larping, larping black factored roleplaying. Oh, running around

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       when these guys that are in skull and bones and there's a lot of weird, silly, ritualistic shit that they are doing. And apparently they're literally are people to this day, I don't mean the Alex Jones broke into it and it was over a decade ago and filmed it. These fucking people are. They're burning in effigy. They have sticks wrapped up there, burning it for the sacrifice of the owl God. Man. This is like, he's like millionaires and it's

Speaker 2:          00:10:24       I. They couldn't have chose something better than that. Molex a bad motherfucker, dude. Apparently. I don't know. I've never. I know that there are topics carry everything, but why not a grizzly bear? That would definitely be scary than it. That will totally be scary. It makes it even gnarlier noise. I was. Don't sound scary and it took a long time from Allah kill you and you probably would win if you had to go toe to toe in an owl. I put my money on myself. Fuck yeah. All you need to do is grab a hold of his neck was not any kind of defenses and will have not even like a, it could flesh out whenever we're talking about what we're talking about life and death and kill it, kill it. But even a small brown bear, black bear, I'll fuck you up man. Kind of bears are scared of you so you don't have to worry about them as much.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       But uh, you know, if he wanted to fucking cat man, 30 pound cat, scary as shit. I do have a desire, I don't think I'll ever make it happen to have like a cougar sized cat is like my, my pet. And I don't mean like pet, like I want to lock it around on a leash. I just want someone to break into my house while I'm gone. So you know the, the variation being, Oh, you got your dogs, they're the Robert Breaks in or whatever the dog, they run away. Well the cat, the drama breaks in, she's keeps stealing shit. Right? And he's like, unhooking your TV and all of this and all of a sudden there's going to hear that roar from a Puma and it's on his neck just murdering him. So you come home and you're like, oh, I see you had someone to play with while I was gone.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       They see that if you see a mountain lion first, that it's very likely that he's not going to attack you if you see him first. I couldn't believe that a pcs, you first, he might not be able to resist it. You know, if he knows that you don't know what the fuck has happened, that that rush of just creeping up on you. And Jack knew bushwhacking speech so far. I mean that's what they love. So what they should do is I should get

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       mountain lions to be the ones that spread the gospel of Jesus around because then nobody would know that they were around. They could sneak up on you and I,

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Hey, you haven't been to talk about our Lord and Savior. You're like, fuck, where'd you come from? They would do it a little differently than they would introduce you to them immediately. At least if you get killed by a cat though, they kill you know, barriers. Just start eating it. Just hold it down and start eating you. That's, that's a lot more of a pain in the ass here. But that guy in Africa student, he got eaten by a bear fucked up by chimpanzees. Oh, they dragged him a mile, dragged him a mile, beat the fucking shit out of him, dragged them under a fence and then dragged them like, can we blame Kubrick for that? Well, these chimps were all problem chimps. They were all chimps that had been in zoo's and captivity. They were trying to reintroduce that CDC problem. Champs should be. Somebody should have a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       Chips are, but they're not. They're not even wild chimps. Chimps that they're trying to reintroduce the wild zoo champs circus champions. So they're like, I needed therapy. And then these chimps. Sure. They finally got issue as well. A lot of those chimps, first of all, I think they get milk, mental illness, if you're naturally a supposed to be in a wild situation where you're all your instincts are tuned into protecting yourself, looking around, making sure that nothing sneaking up on you and yet you live in front of a giant glass wall where every day these weird pink monkeys are staring at you and your senses are going off and you have you don't know what the fuck to do. He just becomes normal and you get used to it, but every day you probably go crazy. They're probably crazy. It's completely unnatural environment

Speaker 2:          00:13:55       because they have the the higher brain capacity to to to to logically work out what's going on, where they're at, how this, how this whole deal works and how many of them are or abused.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       I think a lot. I think a lot of them get abused. You know, that's the scenario that took place in that a planet of the apes movie, the most recent one was that one guy was an asshole spraying the champs with the hose. I'm sure that happens. I'm sure they the news, and I'm sure they're assholes too. I should. They do country things and you want to fucking spray the chimp with a hose. I wouldn't doubt that for a second. Have you seen him raping frogs? Ooh, yeah. It's hilarious. But fuck a frog. Who put them in. What they do? Throw the frog in there at some point. Like monkey ruthless frog. I wonder if it was just a natural occurrence. The frog just fucked up and wound up there, but a lot of them though, they have like a thing where you can't climb out.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       Yeah. So I think there's some like 19 year old zookeeper dip shit. He's like people and animals. What a strange combination. It's going to be real weird if we find out that something much smarter than us because we're going to have to figure out how to convince it to not put us in a zoo. I think about the way we treat all this shit that's just barely a little less. A little less than us. I don't think that they would have to be convinced. I think we do it to ourselves anyways, probably reality television. We're, we're, you know, the idea of sticking out behind a cage and letting us act like the biggest assholes we could possibly think of a generally in New Jersey. Uh, then there you go. It's ratings. Wonder. Yeah. Housewives that shows like a human zoo and a lot of ways or that's part of the appeal is that you don't know anybody like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       You're not hanging out. You're not introducing anybody like those idiots in your life, but yet you can watch them, you know, like the men posturing with each other. I'm going to call him Joseph Feed. He's a fucking girl. That one. You're like, whoa. I do you hear yourself? This is an actual. You're a grown man. Josephine. That's a pretty complex for calling another won't really common common and Jersey Grandmother's name Josephine, Italian woman's name. It's very common, but the guy was joe who's calling Josephine, meaning you'd go to a fulcrum, use a little girl. I'm cooling. My girls knew like, what kind of asshole would you. I mean, would you ever let that guy in your house, would you ever hang out with him? If anybody like that was talking to your house? He would immediately start mocking them and you would go get the fuck out of here. I'm probably married. That's your type.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       Oh, I love it. Oh, oiled up. Spiky hair and lots of, uh, lots of big earrings. Steroids. Oh, totally.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       To Stop. Big Hoop earrings. Those are very important. Something about the daring dual hoop dj on the side. I did the stretch. Things start happening. There's two, I don't know, I don't know when the plug thing started happening. I know like, I mean there was a piercing kids.

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       We're into that and it was like a certain kind of a certain kind of scene want to do that. And then like hipsters started doing it like indie kids are kids and then it started to grow, grow, grow, and then, well, and you know, at some point, okay, let's say you don't want to fucking hearing anymore. You don't have to wear an earring, but we just fucking mangled your ear into some weird grown out disc like once you get over that, I don't know. Uh, I suppose they like loop it over the rest of the year. They cut it back. I've heard someone say that he can do whatever. I'm like, well, who wants to go through all of that?

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       That's a pain in the ass. And then what did you get? Staff? Yeah, you're stupid. Yeah. There's two things that always troubled me in our culture. Like how does that get that far? Because I understand, you know, in other cultures have been doing things for thousands of years and the Thai stick fucking robots.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       You're living in a jungle and I mean, you're not even trying to be about modernization. You're just living your life.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       But in this country there's that. There's the ear thing and then there's the fucking saggy pants thing, the saggy pants and kills me more near thing. The saggy

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       pants thing is, uh, I can't believe if you came up to me and the 19 eighties and said these things, saggy pants are still be around 2012. There's no way. It's so dumb. I can't believe it's here now. I'm like, trust me, it's not going to last. They don't even know what it's from. It's from prison. When the guys are in prison, they got no belts because they don't want to commit suicide. So everyone's sagging their pants. So when they get out, they used to doing that. It's like an ex con thing. Something cool about it. Well, somehow or another it became a rockstar thing and like you meet guys that are in bands and they're sagging their pants, they have their pants buckled up over there. I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? Are you a gangster? Are you a basketball shorts underneath?

Speaker 3:          00:18:29       What is that about? What is that? That is a weird. It's horrible. And then how about. And then there's kids with the skinny jeans, the practical jeggings, and they're say like, there's like a little weird urge to pants those guy in headbutt them when you see a dude with the pants, like really just below their dick, like this is just, you're crazy. You're sprinting and watch me follow themselves, walking around amongst people and you basically look like a slob. You basically handcuffing yourself and you're allowing people to close the handcuffs like you've got this little thing on. You can just say we're just pants you and push you over. Like, this is ridiculous. This is the dumbest thing. You can be retarded. What kind of man? What kind of. What does that say about our society that people, for whatever reason, this is how they choose to leave the house. They want to buckle their pants above their cock and have their underwear hanging above it. What? No, that's what you do. Yeah, man, it's dope. I'm sagging like that doesn't even. That's got to be some sort of a. it's an aberration, like some sort of a.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       you'd think so, but it just continues to exist and perpetrate and it just still continue to be. I see people like that all the time. I see guys where they buy the jeans. Sag. I'm so much that. And then where the long shirt that it. It looks like crazy legs or your knees are two feet long. That doesn't make any sense. I mean, you know what? I'm not here to talk about fashion for the most part in terms of like why didn't mean that in general we want to talk about fashion. A politician. I'm not here to talk about Fascia and my opponent was talking about fashion. I want us to tax you for skinny jeans.

Speaker 3:          00:20:10       Yeah. Taxi for being a Douche bag is your belt buckle below your Dick. You're a fucking idiot. Okay. Is Your Dick Above your belt? Buckle. You Sir are an asshole. You need to put your fucking pants off. You can't possibly be contributing to society. How old does that make you feel to have that very old, that rant. Not just old, but a confused like, this is not something has happened. I think

Speaker 2:          00:20:31       we've lived through arrows and are familiar with, with evolutions of fashion as it is and just we've seen, yeah, not nearly as preposterous. No, no, they're not. And yet and not nearly as offensive either. So we started off on from [inaudible] 77, so I remember when bell bottoms are still kind of hanging around and fucking mork and mindy vest, but like the multicolor them goofy shit. Right. And the bowl haircuts but then going into the eighties and they're like the, the, the abstract hairs and the all the different. And there was like the, all the androgynous shit. There was the super tight stuff. There was a really colorful stuff. There's like everything. The girls that look like Nagel paintings. Okay. I seen all that and then you go to the nineties and then it just got okay. Sagging pants and like weird odd colors and shoulder pads and whatever. And then the 2000 and then you start. Now we start combining fashion stuff from, from classic era's and Amin all sorts of stuff is making all kinds of comebacks. So you're seeing looks from all over the place everywhere. Every day, even right now, that is the word, the sagging jeans just that is the. I just can't get. I mean

Speaker 3:          00:21:42       that's the bottom. That's the least understandable rockstar on

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       stage and you're sagging your jeans a little bit and you're looking like particular you're deliberately trying to look like, like you're a, like a pile of shit, like some sort of thrown together. Just just sloppy son of a bitch on purpose. Yes. Got It. To a degree when you were like a size 30 waist and you've got 40 genes on and they're just piled around your ankles and just what the fuck are you thinking of buying like quadruplex shirts that hang down past your knees, you know who wears shirts that are so big that it covers their whole body. Women do when they sleep at night and I'm not pregnant yet or when they're pregnant, they were that. Or girls wear that when you're like 14 your 90 shirt. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:22:34       Silly Bitch. Someone's got to pants you. Someone's got pants. You push you over and pull your shirt over the top of your face and then give you nuggets. It's ridiculous. Look, and I can't believe it's still around, it doesn't make sense and I think it has something to do with the fact that we're not fulfilling our hunter gatherer jeans. A hunter gatherer genes are being ignored. 100 genes, $100 jeans are sagging our warrior genes. They're not being fulfilled, so we have all these genetic impulses that are all suppressed and so what do people do? What goes off in aberrations and some. Some aberrations are like sagging jeans. They do stupid shit because they know that they're not. They don't have to work. If you were out in fucking Alaska and you were running away from bears all day, you would have your belt buckles cinched in, have your fucking boots tied, walk outside the door and you would the fuck is that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:22       You wouldn't be like, yeah man, you no longer taking cops to put my pants sagging. Do they're medicating themselves on purpose, leaving medical, leaving their house dulled. Why? Because they're thumbing their fingers. That given the finger to nature, right? You're saying it's so safe. I can go out with my fucking lap belt tightening to think of new ways to be an asshole because I don't have anything to worry about it anymore dated, going outside, not worried about sleeping on a park bench, you know, worried about animals coming up and eating, you know, animals out here, the pigeons, that's it. You're going to worry about shit and they're not doing a damn thing with God. Dammit. We thumbed our nose and the face of evolution, and this is the. This is the system we found. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       the, the, the easier things get, the weaker we become, the more we started looking for new and other ways to try and express that which is not be used at all and not that I'm saying everybody needs to go out and start getting a fistfight, drinking whiskey and, and being fucking heavy metal bat. I like myself, but do something. Do something difficult. So your character, anything difficult, anything like to start by let's say maybe want using definite, definite a definite words. When you speak, stop saying like kind of sort of. I sat there and listened to a cable guide connecting my myself saying, well you kind of do this, and it's like that, and it's, what do you mean? It's kind of in like you fucking hit the enter button and it absolutely positively chooses set thing that you fucking put the cursor on this not kind of, it's not sort of, it's like it's a filler.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       It's, it's, it's another, but now it's come in, you don't want to commit to anything. Nobody wants to deliberately say I'm going to be there at this time and I'm going to fucking be. There was a kind of maybe, you know, no one ever wants to also be deliberate in their speech because what they say I'm going to go. And I, I think that uh, that black is the new gray and then someone goes, what? No, no. And they disagree because you made a definite statement. You took a stand, you made yourself, you know, and I think black is the new. Great, fuck you. If you think differently, fine, we're going to get into an argument about it. I might run you over with my fucking car, whatever, but this is how I feel about it. If you say I kind of thing that I get to name, it gives you that wiggle room that you can fucking slinkier way out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       You can use your greased up and slide it under the door kind of. And I fall. It's such a common part of speech at this point that even I find myself saying like, and kind of here and there, but I can't stand it. I hate when I catch myself saying like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not all about the like either, but you know, kind of this sort of that and no, it isn't kind of or sorta anything. Lots of shit in this world is not Kinda sorta. It just is. So you can't, you can't get away from that. Just fucking deal with it. So uh, you know, that's just a huge pet peeve of mine dealing with people on a regular basis because it's, it's so much easier for someone to think of things. Always have the ability to excuse themselves from it. So that way they don't ever have to take the brunt of the responsibility either way,

Speaker 3:          00:26:39       reason for not liking that and other people's that you would hate to see ever in yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       It's an. It's a weakness we've all been seeing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       Yeah, well done. Those things are all done. Bullshit. Stuff like that. I think the difference being is when you realize that that was bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       Yeah. You learned. Yeah. And some people aren't learning some and that's, that's where they need to. Someone needs to kick him in the ass. Somebody needs to say, listen, you got to catch the fuck up. Right? You learn from your mistakes and then improve and move on. It's not just a continual cycle of failing and trying to get back on the horse and failing. It's learned how to ride a fucking horse. Okay? It's not how many times you fall off the horse. Don't fall off the fucking horse again. Stupid. Train the Horse, right? Ride the horse right and don't fall off the horse. You could be Christopher if you keep falling off horses, especially if you want to get a horse to jump over some shit that he doesn't want to jump over. I will never understand that

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       and it's. You know what? It is a lot to say that you could master an animal like that, but it is a massive fucking animal and when he doesn't want to do what it wants to do, like how are you? How do you think it's great that we can use our intellect to control this thing, but when it came down to the physical aspects, like you can't make a fucking horse do what it doesn't want to know.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       Pullover shifts. One thing, if you run a trail horse, you want the horse to ride on the trail horse with a 200 pound man on his back. It's really not that big a deal for a horse and they can safely walk. But you want a horse to jump over shit. You want it to fly through the air with a person the back. Okay. You fucking crazy. What? What's what? What if you ever tried? There's a lot of other shit, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       fucking take a martial arts class, learned how to drive a race car and race cars are great. They have breaks there. They're fantastic. They learn how to steer the very predictable. It's not a fucking animal. Some crazy might of its own. It just wants to jump for whatever reason, wants to fuck you back.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       He lands on you and crushes your scholar rock. How about that? The rest of your life, you've. If you have a window the size of a quarter that you could see the world out of and you're fucking shitting your pants.

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       That's not anything that I'm interested to. This is what I shoot all horses on site. Have you ever had some of those Alistair overeem? More steaks? No. No, no. I haven't worked my way up. I'm more of a goat. Dick Guy. The whole heavy metal attitude. A little spicier. It's supposed to be really a delicious. Actually I have had horse meat into then at Bra. Did you like. Oh really do wrong. Yeah. It's like a horse that she needs like a delicacy over there, especially in like tissue in the more southern prefectures, but I just, it doesn't. Uh, I didn't dig it. Alright. And then what does Johnston? I'm a is, it kind of gave me kind of Gamey. It's, I couldn't really. I'd be like sort of a taste maybe closer to that. Uh, but I like Venice, love Venice. Uh, it's just, it's a little

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       man. I'm amazed how hard it is to get venison. You would think like really like. Yeah. You think like these are fucking pretty prevalent animals. Why is it someone breeding them? Like around here, you know, I mean

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       somewhere in the valley or something. That big fucking field of because thing, it's worth a shit. Was hard enough to get to get assholes in Hollywood as it is. And then then you go ahead and then you want to deliver something like, okay, they're gonna eat cow. They'll eat chicken. Definitely fish. I was just making fun of somebody in the day. Where do you want to to Sushi? Oh, of course you want to go to such a let's get a Sushi. I love Sushi. I'm like, God, give me some like, oh, have you ever been to a Sushi restaurant? Like what the fuck? Why does every woman in la? Why don't eat fucking raw fish? Why do you think that is? Because it's what other, what they think every other woman in La. Those really. Yes. I thought it was because it was now me. It's good, but it's not like fuck, let's go eat Sushi. Like fuck that. Like you don't wake up one day and just think, okay, I might use to want fish. I just want to say yes to everything man. So I, I forced me and it was all right. But uh, um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       what do you even like the other one thing he like almost above everything else during your, in your diet or you'd be fairly clean, like nutrition minded or flavor?

Speaker 2:          00:30:52       Uh, try to be both. I mean, I do really enjoy the red meat hamburger or steak or you can do a lot. It's pretty personal too with that, right? Yeah. So most satisfying food. But one thing is, okay, there's that, or if I just had some serious piece of ass, the very next thing I want to hand to the next thing I want is a fucking him I've, I've left. I've left departments at odd hours of the night just tracking down any 24 hour Carl's Jr and Jack in the box because I need a fucking hamburger immediately.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       I'm done with the late night hamburgers. I switched over, I try to use, I tried to eat some chicken sandwiches. I'll eat like a carl's jr chicken sandwich or something like that. But the progress, it's either in and out or Wendy's and the other tapping out. I can't. I can't do Mcdonald's burgers too.

Speaker 2:          00:31:51       I don't, I don't almost. I almost never eat any of that crap. I'll be honest. Like I, if I'm going to have a burger, there's plenty of places I could go that I know that meat is a lot healthier and I understand also the idea of keeping costs at those so far overboard in terms of what corporations is people try to do to save a buck. Basically you through all integrity out the window, so I can't support them

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       that. What is that? That's not even a burger. You've seen those pictures where they could take a Mcdonald's burger and then they track it for six months and it doesn't rot, which just sits there.

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       I heard I did read about that because my buddy did the same thing in his gym, a crossfit breath. He took the Bergens, left it there and it didn't. And then I read something about, well, it's got so much salt in it, so it's more of a salt thing. Really. They said the weirdest thing about it isn't really the Burger. It's thought that thing, not molding. That's where that's the most fucked up part of the whole thing and you should really be the most worried about putting that in your mouth. Really that phrasing, I figured that a piece of bread, I mean you can, you can salt meat to a degree that you know, that it keeps for a long time. They've been doing that forever, but I mean long before we had refrigeration, all meat with salt and pretty much so. And you can make it into Jerky, that bond, we don't really write. It doesn't have that kind of shelf life. What is the effort, what are they putting in there? So insane preservatives, I don't know, something, something totally Ireland that you really probably shouldn't be putting in your body.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       It's amazing. But in order to feed the amount of the amount of people that we have packed in the cities, like you just drove here from Orange County, think of that crazy drive which is one of the worst drives in the country as far as population centers. I mean that is an enormous amount of people from the four. Oh, five for the five. That whole area is, that's an incredible amount of pain you're going through

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       through all these different demographics the whole way. And the only food. Everybody needs food. I think that there is a. I'm like, okay, Penn and teller, I love watching of filler bullshit. And they had their whole thing on organic food and about how uh, you know, the various chemicals also determined whether it's something can be called organic or not, but then some certified or things that can be considered organic in terms of pesticides are actually worse than that than the things that they've created since then. Well fine, but it's that fine line where if you like, you can take it to this point. Okay. To a degree. But people take it that, you know, they want to save that extra thirty cents on the dollar while, or three cents on the dollar and cent on the dollar and pink slime. That should just never be. It should just never be excellent. Yeah. That, that, that pace that they throw into the burgers.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       Oh yeah. Normally, yeah. Like all the really gnarly treated with like ammonia see you kill all the bacteria that's in it. It's like the idea that that's a burger. It's ridiculous that in a burger. Have you seen, what would they do to fast food burgers? The fillers and all the different things they have. I love, Oh fuck out. Or I'll have a three by three. Would you like five guys? Five guys. Five guys? Pretty fucking good. I might like that better than out on your button.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       Yeah, my buddy was going in and out. It's better. I think I will say that there

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       equal, equal, pretty fucking bad ass. Can we just say separate? Different. Separate but separate sequel. They're equally delicious

Speaker 2:          00:35:25       in a different way. I'm a big fan. I'm A. I'm really on a hunt to find the best ultimate cheeseburger you can get anywhere and a mommy's definitely got a great one. Father's office was fantastic and I'll the whatever you know the 12 bucks on a hammer

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       in Atlanta called the laughing skull and they got some cheeseburger place, apartment. That is God. I can't remember if you remember that place. Brian. The laughing skull plus the cheeseburger place. Hadn't remember. Torsions fusion. Fusion, I think. I don't remember. Whatever it is. If you're in Atlanta, it's above the laughing, so it's the fucking greatest cheeseburger place on the face of the earth. He had like all great buffalo burgers with blue cheese and just gore may slam and cheeseburgers. Real meat cooked the way you want. You want it rather than giving you a rare. You want a medium, right? Right.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       Trust, trusted. It's like, oh, it was so awesome. There's a place in Chicago I got to get to. It's all heavy metal theme called coolest corner. Have a slayer burger or go burger later. The minute listen, a good horror burger. It was. It was like a. It was like a lamb patty or something with ground beef sirloin and these are like gourmet, like pretzel rolls a with goat cheese on top. I mean to to to put like the layer that entire one has these, these sauteed a pear slices that have been thrown on top of Gorgonzola and all this, I mean just damp and you have dirty metal heads in there listening to know immortal and then they're just counting the greatest burgers. Never known world. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       weird combination and the Jews like in a death metal and exquisite gourmet burgers. Yeah. That's so rare.

Speaker 2:          00:37:13       Exactly. Why not go there? How did you become a big death metal head? Started off just getting into metal from the classic rock side of things and my dad used to play guitar and just for fun like Blues and Classic Rock and grew up listening to Sabbath and led Zeppelin and the Beatles and what have you. And then I found like this kid that was the son of where my babysitter, he was in, he introduced me basically to I made. And that was like, oh fuck yeah, of course at like six years old seeing Eddie. The mascot was the coolest thing ever. Like seen iron gate. It's like a monster look in Zombie thing. They call him Eddie. And I remember he had this killer's shirt for the new album killers and Scott and he's like holding like some limp woman in his hand with like a bloody hatchet in the other spot that is so bad ass.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       And then I remember like, and then from there with like metallica and slayer and negative and anthrax and, and uh, and then that progressed to, I remember hearing simple Hoorah. And that was harder and heavier. And then I found this pan bolt thrower and I'm like, what the fuck is that? The covers are so amazing and they're from these games like whammer 40 k stuff, something like that. I already liked that. So let me check this out. Oh God. This is the heaviest, most crushing music I've ever heard. It sounds like. It sounds like. Sounds like an entire army of guitars coming up over the top of a ridge. And then all fisk fucking you all at once.

Speaker 2:          00:38:56       Pretty much on Marshall amps. Dropped out of the sky continuously on top of yours. Raining on you being written by like trolls. Is that the kind of Shit you listened to you in your car? Blew my tire out though. I'm playing the music. Oh it didn't? No, he didn't know what you said. You listen to them when you work out. I listened to it all the time, but it's. It really depends on my mood so I can listen to. The only thing that I'll have on my ipod is country music. Really? I can't get with country music. You'd ever heard you? No. Reagan. Bob Marley. I could probably buy one reg, a compilation album and have all the essentials for any reggae song ever created ever. And I'm okay with this. Like 10 really good ones. Right? Would you be loved? That's a great gym. Yes. That's a great jam. Stand out to you

Speaker 3:          00:39:43       that get up. Stand up. Yeah, but it gets a little repetitive

Speaker 2:          00:39:47       and I, you know, I've heard it said like, okay, got it. Got It. All right. Now what are you seeing about today? I and I. What? All right, cool.

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       Yeah, but at least it's better than Hawaiian music. Hawaiian. They're very proud people and I would understand if you got offended and when I go to Hawaii next time when people are pissing me, but the reality is you're there. You had a perfect rock, new orleans, the perfect climate and the most beautiful place in the world, and you're playing a song like the red and green button will all this shit you can be playing right now. You could be playing a whole lot of love. You can be playing led Zeppelin. Okay? You guys can have acd, skinner, you. You'd be playing some real fucking music. This is ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       How has this not been changed by the introduction of a song? That song go that song? She can. It sounds ridiculous. Uh, all the great songs, but it's like, well, I island things, you know? Yeah. Oh, Jesus always cracked me up is as you look like a magazine and her flying to Hawaii for the first time, it will fight super raw 13 and I'm looking through the inflight magazine and it's got a little section for all the music and felt like, oh, here's the look, you know, channel four locals and you look and there was like this gnarly big jacked up to, to the big handlebar, the gnarly biker mustache or whatever. It's like food for Luther is his name and spelling. You listened to his music. The sweetest boys ever. I've been

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       blowjobs or like right in the morning with Strawberry Syrup, all I'm just tripping shoulders. He does a, pulls them out of socket because he's like 470 pounds, eight feet tall and used to play for the NFL. It's just bad music for the greatest place on earth warrior culture to chill music. It's all good. That killed those red and green bananas. Shit. Take five minutes while resting scares me about the fucking hilarious though. Oh, that would be cool.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       Maybe it's the navy. It was a strategy to keep people from moving to Hawaii. Just keep putting that shit in music and I get tired of this music because if you were like on the beach and they're like the best bands in the country all were in Hawaii. You're like, why don't we live in

Speaker 4:          00:42:39       cool.

Speaker 3:          00:42:42       That's awesome. And the dirty upset, right? You spend a lot of time on why a lot of people get upset.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       They're not happy about all of us. How he's coming down there or actually really anybody from the mainland, they're just like, why don't you stay there

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       really? Even if you're a Hawaiian blood from them. Any live in the wetland.

Speaker 2:          00:42:56       Yeah, I can't. I can't speak on that, but as far as if you're just not Hawaiian, she ever lived there? No. I spent time there and amazingly a why were great to me. I Love Hawaiian island cultures at large. I think part of it is because I'm from a place like Seattle and I have some country roots to me in terms of like I grew up, we'd go hunting and race cars and just all kinds of redneck. He asked Shit in addition to any of this high art bullshit that my mom got me sort of weaned on and love like modern architecture and culture and the classics and reading, but I'm a fucking down there. They're like, oh no, you're really down to earth who? You're cool. You're all right now. You're, you're cool. You're a Allie. The rest of those fuckers.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       Well, sure. I mean if he, he will see the average douchebag, American tourists, you know, route. I wouldn't. Yeah. I wouldn't want them to fucking crush reader. Especially. A lot of people who are emotional and fork and spoon was one of those Jersey Douche bags because you imagined most jersey shore type or housewives of Jersey type of Douche bags or you can even take the Jersey shore, the west coast from Heineken. One of those assholes around down there,

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro,

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       perfect. That was a really good impression of one of those asshole say bro. 17 times and every sentence you want me to show the fuck out, get more tribal task. We need to get those motherfuckers in the gym and then it get strangled and need to get humiliated. They need to get down to earth like calm the fuck down

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       and just be a little nicer taste. So much more than that because so many guys, especially on the west coast now, the west coast, each bag, they go to the gym every now and again. They definitely live. You go there, they go to plays or whatever they do. They train, train Joko to use

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       and they get in there and they never really fight a little bit. Not Fighters. They're just guys that had a couple of fights. The big difference, but

Speaker 4:          00:45:02       you're getting humbled and humiliated in the gym

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       because outside of the gym like, well, that's a different place as a whole other that's a sort of country that only exist there and then when I'm out in the general populace, when I'm being an asshole on the streets of of like main street and end and Pch, that's. It's different. That's the big problem that there is a lot of those guys, right? There isn't a Douche. Bags are douchebags of average downer. I've leveraged honoring every Douche bag has this has this thing. You got your history Douche bag that thinks they're so above you and there's culture and everything they say has so much meaning behind it, so much deeper. It's like, no, you're just as bullshit. Anybody else? In fact, more so because you don't even realize that they should. You say it doesn't matter or you know you've got. You've got the MMA douche bag like runs around wants me to make sure everybody knows that they train and that it can fly and all that kind of bullshit and you've got your club each day. You've got bags of all sorts. Not everybody takes it as money. Douche bags. There's fitness Douche bags, just fitness to stretch your grade. You can't even have a conversation about anything but their diet. I mean, that's wonderful. That's how I want to spend the next 30 minutes sitting at a table with someone that's talking about how many like grains of rice they can have and everything. And it's for like, like a, a,

Speaker 4:          00:46:26       it's competition. Like what are you doing? Well, it's like, you know, you sort of do a, you know, different poses and you know, you do like maybe a little bit of gymnastics. Like cheerleader seems a lot like cheerleading, man. What are you doing? A fitness competition with a megaphone, you support the team.

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       It's just ridiculous bodies. But even with, if the minute they step off the stage like that, I've had an elegant or they.

Speaker 4:          00:47:01       It's like, hey, how you doing? Hey, what's up? Oh, you're a mom. You're like, oh, I don't know. I don't want to talk about, you know, boneless chicken breast. No, I, you know what I'm here for. I've got somewhere to be, but I'll be right back. Don't worry about that. It didn't supersized in the morning thinking about hills. Fucking do it. I don't want to talk about it. How was the. How could anybody consider that to be something interesting? Oh yeah. We have that. We have an understanding and that I know a secret that is

Speaker 2:          00:47:31       it for entertainment.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       Never understood. People that are into like I can understand wanting to be in shape, but I can understand like crossfit competitions and stuff like that

Speaker 2:          00:47:42       to be the best in the world of working out and be the best in the world at doing cleans, you know, Olympic. No, no 100 cleans in a row with 50 pounds. You know, like we need to know what's going on here for bodybuilding. So is like, okay, hold on. Everybody has a, you know, they're using the way that they're going to live for a specific purpose. Now I'll say I think bodybuilding is pointless. What's the point of putting all that time and effort to look at it? Just look a certain way. I never use it. And then you've got the crossfit, which is the same thing, exact same thing, but just they're an actual better overall shape and you know, they use it, but they only use it for more working out. So we're basically just jerking off the whole time. That's all anybody is doing.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       They're just jerking themselves off and uh, you know, okay, well why don't you body build because you know, you to look better on screen or do power lifting because you want to be stronger and then do crossfit, whatever workout for your anaerobic endurance animal and all this. And then like take it and then go play a game. Go play football with your friends or go hiking or climbing a mountain or grappling or something like that and then apply it into a skilled deal. I saw this video where there was, it was the gist of it was these two nfl dues are boxers are very. Nfl guys are former NFL. They just come from facts and they did some prostitute workout, some crossfit gym in La and they did an x amount of time then. And here's our crossfit guys that are here all the time that the kids did it faster than the other guys. And I'm like, but they can catch a fucking football. You can just run around with a little. He's like an asshole. That's all you can do. You can do 100 kipping pull ups. Great. So a great. Well let's just stop you from no one. You know what? 100,000 people are not going to fall into a stadium and pay millions of dollars for Washington.

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       Pull ups are about someone trying to do something and someone else trying to stop them from doing something. So multifaceted. Sort of the competition when you're dealing a bunch of chips. No stopping you. It says you have chefs and it's, it's kind of a weird halfway sport. I'm going, I can see how it's athletic or conceal requires willpower and discipline. Amazing Shit. And it's impressive when got incredible shit. But I would rather, I would rather learn a martial art. I would rather learn how to play a game. I'd rather learn to do rather learn hockey anything. It's just kind of be more input. There's more going on than just standing there doing cleans.

Speaker 2:          00:50:23       I can't. I don't get it either. I, I think like that's the you do to make you help you be better at the real thing that you do.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       Yeah. I was talking to. I slept competition, competition in class. Take some intermural basketball. We do something we were talking to play, go play a tournament. Do crossfit,

Speaker 2:          00:50:50       be in shape and Api the way these days shape and an API it don't, don't go run around the whole world about it. So like don't look at other somebody else and be like, well when I did that, you know francine and I did Zelda. I did it 17 minutes and that's it. I don't care. No name, name, name, name Tommy and rescue and Nikki's deck, like a righteous indignation when they order the green tea at starbucks. But that's. I don't even. And I think the root, all that kind of stuff isn't doing. Crossfit isn't doing any. It couldn't be any. You could substitute crossfit with anything else. It's just something comes along. It gets to a certain level where people start jumping on it because one, whether it's good or it's bad, it's something that's new and it's different and it and it and it is a change from what the norm was, so therefore everybody feels like they're like they're improving who they are, they're they're growing and now they're a part of something that's more special and therefore then that by a group gets taken way out of context and then the after effects of that are people becoming Douche bags

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       mathematically, Broadway, lot of Nice people and there's a lot of people that don't want to just go to the gym and lift weights and be bored, so they take the shitty stuff. Of course there's good stuff

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       not working out and staying healthy is awesome. I love that crossfit is as looked back to older, simpler ways of training and brought that to the, to the, to the populace. I think that's great. You know, strongman type stuff, old schools, the old school thought processes of just, you know, grab heavy shit and lifted, but you know, there's a lot of flawed reasoning in my opinion. Behind some of that too, and also like I get so sick of it. Oh I, you know, I'm saying like a fighter, like, no you're not, you're not a fighter. It's not the same trying to choke the life out of you brain, you know, and if you go to kickboxing class at night, that doesn't make you a fighter either. Like fighters are fighters, people that do martial arts, martial art, martial art, you know, the train training is know what, just be realistic and there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 2:          00:53:10       If you're not going to be a fighter, even though you've trained in martial arts, that's okay. People talk to me about coming and trying to jam or or whatever. And I said, you know what? Don't do it because you want to be a fighter. If you really want to be a fighter, the fighter, not a fighter, to, to, to every level that you need to, which these, you're probably never going to amount to anything with fighting because it's. The odds are totally against you, but that's not the reason you do it. Not Because of success that you think are going to get from it. You do it because you're driven and you love it and you have to do it and that's the only way that you can ever fully realized that most of your potential. More people are going to fail, then they're going to succeed, but honestly if you are better when you end it and when you started and you don't have any regrets and you absolutely succeeded, you didn't get the metals you need to get the money, but you took you as you stood here today and became something better and more encompassing and have lived a life experience because you decided to do something and do it like you mean it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       And that's hard for people to wrap their heads around that, you know, I go into the gym, I just want to be better than when I step off of that than I was when I stepped on it. And some days aren't so great. Some days are amazing and I also have like this huge mean streak. I hate losing whatever, but I also. And as much as that is always a part of who I am, uh, I have to temper that and I have to look at all the data that comes from everything that I do when I'm in the gym and then break it down and then be more effective. But I think that guy he used up, do, you know, I mean, yeah, in my head I'm thinking I'm going to jab the living shit out of that fucker until his Dick Falls off. That's how much I'm going to jab that period. I'm going to jab in so many times and he's never been to want to get in the ring with me ever again. Ever. Period. You think this is about training? Yes, but I also have to sit back, but I'll go, why was he able to Jab me? What did I do wrong? But I do, right? Why is this so effective? How do I take that and make it mine? Or how do I analyze that and see the patterns before they become a problem for me,

Speaker 5:          00:55:17       isn't it in the development of a martial arts to see someone set an incredibly high level and realize that that is where the market set

Speaker 2:          00:55:24       can be the best at everything. There's somebody out there, there's probably plenty of people out there that I can just annihilate and uses the toothpick with their user bones as tooth toothpicks when I'm done with them, chances are they're out of that group of people that I'm talking about therapy within that there's things that they do better than I do that maybe that one thing or maybe a couple of things, but they're better at it by far so I could look at them and paste something from. It doesn't matter how much better of a fighter I am. There's so much to be to be seen or taken in. There's a million ways that the body can move and one way you know, and I realized that there's some things I'm never going to be great at because the physicality, physical limitations or injuries or whatever, it's just that's okay. Like I'm never going to get with rubber guard because my knees are too fucked up. What's wrong with you? I have torn ligaments sent home and they're just a mess. This has been repaired on the right before and it was just, they won't take it if I pull on him through our like that, it'll start.

Speaker 1:          00:56:28       It was sent out to like lock master. That's a man that's got to be kind of tricky to be a dry with no injuries and be a guy.

Speaker 2:          00:56:37       I just need a. I just have a very good feel for it and I know what I can get away with and I know a lot of like lost her ankle goes before it needs to be. Oh my ankles are not the greatest thing either. But um, he's just sort of understand what you're dealing with and then go from there. But I have nonetheless, since I know that I'm never going to be someone that can affect it, like be a good rubber guard guy. I pay attention because Shannon like to use those setups. So she's working on something. I can go to her and go, okay, look at you, you know, get angled like this because look at the way that, that pushes your body weight and your pressure against their joint there and this, and this is where now you're creating a weakness in them at this angle, so you can defeat that angle here. Or Hey, this guy's really good rubber guard. Now Watch how he's going to. He's going to try and get these angles and these positions on you because this is where it's going to take you out of position. So this entire you're going to have to defeat them because fulcrums levers, it's all relative.

Speaker 1:          00:57:37       If you work on your flexibility, what I do, it's hard. It's hard to get there. And I'm, I'm older. And how much of a fighter success do you think is a timing issue? Like getting involved in a sport at the right age time? Good. Excellent. Something. How much of it is bulldog determination and just your ability to learn from your mistakes and despite the bad feelings,

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       it's mental, mental, mental aspect of it. Uh, because that's kind of the mental aspect is the thing that is going to not only make you want to fight when you want to quit, but it'll also be a step back and realize that all these things, all these circumstances came about within these moments and how to take them, change them, understand them and make the appropriate changes and additions crashes from your game to be better. You have to be analytical like that and you have to remove emotion from that, from those circumstances because when she get emotionally attached and worked up about it, then it will defeat your ability to be as useful as possible. And like, I mean, especially in the case of a lot of people, most people are never going to be really successful with fighting if they choose that as their, as their, a pair occupation, you know, it's not going to make the money for them to pay one.

Speaker 2:          00:58:59       It's not, but it shouldn't hurt somebody. They should just do it because they love it. I was watching a lecture by Alan, depending, I think his name is, and I'm like that on pessimism. The philosophical lecture on pessimism and about how one of the reasons why you get so upset about things and you get so worked up is because you have these expectations that things are always going gonna work out well, but if she put the reality of most, don't work out at all. In fact, there's almost always more failure than there is success, but you're so primed for success. You have to believe that this will always work in your favor and it's like a traffic. You know, you get so mad and angry and pissed off line and we only traffic, but the thing is is that there's always traffic. Traffic is the, the, the not the exception. It isn't the norm. So when you encounter it, why is he so mad? It's always there and it always occurs, so it's more unusual for there to be any traffic at all, but we have this concept in our head that even getting behind the wheel and driving down the road, it's all gonna work out for us instead of us having to waste just like every other schmo because things are the way they are.

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       Yeah, that's a funny way of looking at it. Um, we, we can't, uh, one thing I can appreciate failure as a tool for success, you know, because every time that I've ever, especially as a comedian, one of the best, most motivating factors is bombing on stage. And when you, when you eat a dick on stage, you never want that to happen again. And you'll tighten everything up. You'll go over your material with a fine tooth comb. Think about your delivery, you listened to recordings. He don't want that feeling. How long does it joke suck before it becomes good? You never know, man. You never know. Sometimes you'll come up with a joke and it's perfect the moment it comes up. And then other times it might take a, a, a year for Joe to evolve. And remember, I'm Louis Ck was telling me that Chris Rock, Chris rock has this one really controversial bit. He goes, ah, I love black people. I hate niggas you ever heard that bit?

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       I don't think I have

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       brilliant bit about, uh, you know about it, you know, the difference between a, in his mind, a black guy. And a Nigga and um, it, it took a long time to work. Apparently it took like a year. It was bombing for a year. He would go on to an each, couldn't get it to work and then it became eventually became a closing bit. It became a bit that it was just destroying perfect old school. Classic bit. But it's one of those things where every bit's got its own timeline. Every bit has its own shelf life to some bits are timeless and some bits they're only good. They're a monster for six months. Maybe it's topical. Maybe things change can make a joke about vhs tapes anymore. Nobody gives a shit thing. Time moves on, you know. I mean, I used to have a great joke about nextel phones. It was a fuck about next time. No, it's uh, some of them will last for a long time and some of them don't. And some of them are done the moment you say it, the first time on stage,

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       that's its lifespan. It's funny. Only the first time hearing it. Sure. Is it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       There's some of that and there's some bits that are there are fully formed bit the moment out of your mouth and the last few years it's totally different, you know, just uh, it completely depends on the subject, depends on what you're trying to say, how, how silly or complex it is. Usually the more common

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       has I imagine also what bits led into that. Sure, yeah. Bits go from exile and what not just jokes being said, but what tone is being set, so all of a sudden you're going one direction. You change gears. Sometimes that immediacy hard stop, changed, catches people off Guard and reserve any and it makes them laugh or at least you know, it gets their mind spinning in a way that sets up the next stuff. Or sometimes it just confuses them and flux the whole rest of the next, you know, 10 minutes of jokes up. Just knowing that you can be a comedian, could easily be a community. Just having this conversation and knowing that I always tell people that you get, it's nothing. It's not that complicated, but it's not easy. A, it's a weird. I've never been to, a comedian was a, was sitting with a friend who was a comedian and they were going to go on and on.

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       I'm just hanging in the pre show and we're all, a bunch of us were all just hanging out in the, uh, in the Iowa and I'm just being the crack and stupid jokes and doing wordplay and whatever. Someone was like, you know, you work in at night. I'm like, I got a little boehner and I was like, very little. And uh, and I just thought, no, I'm not a comedian at all where you think I'm fucking, I like that you can do it. It's not that complicated. It's a, you know, it's almost like a normal skill that everyone sort of has a small form. Most people at least try to have like one or two things they could say that a witty in their life, you know, it's just a matter of cultivating those and becoming like a woody farmer. And I say, how many people can keep their nerve too though.

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       It's a little of that. Yeah. If I had to get on stage and deliver stand up, that would would freak me the fuck out would be more. That's more way more fearful than fighting even five guys all at one time, like that's okay by me, but once you do it a couple times, it would be easy. Dude. I have been in some of these public speaking scenarios where people are so great. I go, I'm shitting myself. So scary. It's crazy. Shitting yourself. It doesn't make any sense, I guess. No real fear. Exactly, and that's, that's, that's a hard thing to get past is that in my mind, I know that that all this fear is all self created. If everybody thought I was an idiot, who cares? Right? It only matters what I think. If I don't think I'm an idiot and I'm okay with it, then fuck you all like go, go fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:04:28       You can all burn. I don't get that shit. Take a long time to get to the point of comfort filled. That is part of being a man and one of the most important parts of being a man is getting to a point where you genuinely, truly don't give a fuck if someone doesn't like what you like. It was like, I know what I like. I don't give a fuck like that. Very few people really don't. And even once we get to that point, where is the one area? A couple areas I should say. Well, we make those exceptions obviously. Yes. What else? He breaks you. Policy Ruins the mind, the brakes. Oh, plus you just tragic. It can break a man. Plus he was one of my song and listen to uh, a from every time I died I got this great lyric. It says, uh, it's uh, it's not lack of ambition that keeps women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden. It's true.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Yeah. I know dudes that it becomes a, it becomes such a massive part of their life that eclipses all else.

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       I have a friend that I've, I've seen him like glue do his fucking phone and it's almost, it should be integrated into his body. He is on it so much and yet it's constantly chattered little text here there. Oh well, you know an hour's gone by on this one, so I need to resend a response there and just constant communication between women the whole time because that's the amount of effort it takes to to bang that much fucking tail. And I remember sitting there thinking, I don't have the patience for this at all. Like it'll just get to a certain point. Then if I deal with enough stupid shit, I'm like, you're a fucking idiot. Get off of my fucking phone. Who's my number? I don't want to talk to you anymore. It's hard enough for me to even have a conversation with you with my thumbs, let alone have to think about the idea of putting aside a block of time to run into you to work you up to the point of trying just to have sex with you.

Speaker 5:          01:06:17       Oh yeah. It gets to a weird point where some people just want to chat all day. What's up? Like you get a text like what's up? Nothing. Some of you thinking of going to the gym. Fucking go fucking go, cut.

Speaker 2:          01:06:34       Tell me how it turns out. I, you know, that's what your facebook is for you to tell me that you're going to go to the gym telling me that you, uh, how, how good of a workout you had you to beat up with a face to face and go, listen, time is very precious for me. My Vagina, vagina, vagina, vagina, man. It does it. So it takes a certain amount of. And this is probably why I'm a single man, but uh,

Speaker 5:          01:06:57       also. But that's also why men try so hard to be bad motherfuckers. They try so hard to be bad motherfuckers. Partially. One of the reasons to dominate is to be more attractive to women. Yes, natural.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       But I got to tell you, the difference between being a real bad motherfucker and being an outwardly, seemingly bad motherfucker is night and day. If you're an outwardly, if you seem like you're a bad motherfucker, then people think than most people think you are right. The real bad motherfuckers. Nobody really ever knows it and they don't. They don't have to tell the world, they don't have to. It's like someone who asked me the other day about if I ever get into street fights or anything like that. And I go, no, because the people that even when I want to fight them, they won't. And they're like, oh, well they all, oh, who would fight you? And I go, they don't know who I am. I'm not famous. I'm not a celebrity. They don't know our, amongst martial artists. Right. And you know, if I, if you give me my little pocket of people, yeah, I'm fucking somebody there.

Speaker 2:          01:07:50       But in general you're here. I'm sure dog on. I'm so popular. I'm so amazingly. I'm just all flammable. But the rest of the world, nobody knows who the fuck I am. I'm okay with that. So, you know, I've had guys, I balled me, whatever I've seen the fucking the signs of it. You think if anybody knows when the fight gonna happen and be a fighter. So when I go, or if someone's being a Dick deliberately in my presence or to a woman that's, that's around or whatever, and I step up and I say something like, I go, people don't want to fight me and I owe because you're bigger. No, no. It's got nothing to do any of that. Because when you look into somebody's eyes, you can tell who really wants to fucking fuck people up. Who really doesn't. And I don't get upset.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       I don't yell, I don't scream. I don't have any, I don't have to do any of that. I just look at them. I tell them how it's going to be and I let him know if this is what we want to do. Like I'll enjoy it. Like, let's just please make this happen. I've said the one guy, I'm like, how many friends do you got? He was like, why? Because you don't have enough. Let me just tell you that much. Or I told one dude or do you don't know anybody that knows anybody that knows anybody that knows anybody that kicked my ass.

Speaker 5:          01:08:58       I don't know what you're going to do here. But getting a bad way, I laughed at a guy to anthrax,

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       I'm standing there with a girl and he keeps trying to nudge. People keep trying to manage through right where we're at and I'm like, of all places you see a dude and a chick go somewhere else. So I'm standing right there and I decided that's it. They're going to have to start going around. So I keep my elbows out, tries. I feel as dude bumping into me on the rise, I can't get through and he tries to get thrown the left, but I'm just standing tall so he's trying to get around it. But he can't. It's like pushing him over him running himself into my own elbow. And then he starts getting mad. I'm just, he's yelling at me about something. I'm going, what is trying to get through man? And he goes, I saw, I saw this, that. And I said, can I go?

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       Anthrax is playing. I can't fucking hear what you're saying. And he's looking at me crazy. I go, just walk up to the front and he gets all fucking wild eyed and he's looking at me crazy and I go, is this what you want to do? Yeah. I just started laughing at him. I go, you just need to keep moving, and eventually the girl in front reaches up and grabs a hold of his arm, pulls down and go, don't do this, don't do this. I'm just smiling the whole time and he just fucking. Of course he leaves. It's all about the posture and you get upset. When I look at you, you're, you ready?

Speaker 5:          01:10:10       Recurring this in your mind. You're recreating this in your mind. I can see your pulse. Quicken your testosterone that I stay calm but carry a grudge. You carry your story. So I'm a Scorpio, so apparently according to all the books that are out there, I. Yeah, cary grow, but it's also. It's total stripper talk. Yeah, it is. I'm a Scorpio. Spicy thing is a.

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       I love being in those violent confrontations. Why do you like that?

Speaker 5:          01:10:40       Is it because when you were picked on when you were a kid, you still harbor some resentment? Towards people that we fuck with you because you're a nice guy. You would never fuck with anybody, but if someone was fucking with you, it's almost like now you have a license to. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:51       I can't put a finger on it. It was, I knew that, uh, I enjoyed fighting when I was a kid. Like being in the fights. I didn't start the fight, but if you gave me a reason, cool. And then my mom said I was the angriest kid ever. She said, well, when I was born I came out frowning. I looked like I looked like Ron Paul and I fucking, she

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       tried to hug me and I stiff armed her area and she said,

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       broker fucking art. I got the. I wouldn't let my own mother holding me. Wow. And I was yellow and jaundiced and I was an asshole apparently. I just came out. I was like, and she said, as a kid I just, I would, once I blew up about if I got angry, I got so angry. It wasn't like a temper Tantrum, angry. It was like, phew. Ming-Li raging violent, like flames, daggers.

Speaker 5:          01:11:43       I'm just, that's connected between your health at birth, you know, being in poor health at birth and being brought into this world in a bad situation where you're uncomfortable. Yellow and jaundiced. I wonder if that like set the stage for an angry or maybe you got some viking jeans. I might got some Viking genes in there. Even if I bought those, I bought those at Nordstrom. True Religion, Viking jeans, chuck notice gusset horns and a beard on the crotch. As long as it has plenty of like really big buttons. Snaps. Intricately carved a place to hang my hat, my hands. It has to be pre damaged. Pretty damning. Of course it has to look like it's already been through. You know, the Poetic Edda. That's the only thing that's almost as gay as the sagging pants is the caught up pants. The chopped up. The stress is that I went to one place and I was like, do you have any fucking pants?

Speaker 5:          01:12:38       Don't have holes in them. Can I just buy a pair of. I like to have a regular pair of jeans. I'm not a child. Sorry. This is not. This is not gonna last, this fake worn out jeans. This shit is temporary and I'm not buying a fucking pair of jeans that are fake, worn out. It's one thing you wear a pair of jeans out. There's pride in that because these are jeans I've had for 10 fucking years. They're comfortable is shit. Yeah, there's some holes in them, but I broke them in man. I think so and so in those days. There you go. I don't know if I have any. I want to actually take that DNA test that tells you why they can tell you if. Because I know I'm German and I know I'm Irish and Cherokee Indian and I brought some English in me, but no, I got Indiana toll on me. I know I do. This brow Ridge fucking brother in law used to call me the, uh, the eagle from the muppets, the muppets and I never even thought about the eagle is such a prominent frown asshole path. That's a funny fucker. But I want to take that test to also see if I got the warrior gene. Oh yeah. There is a warranty supposed to make. Make

Speaker 2:          01:13:46       People Kinda gnarly and, and the thing is like, I don't have to have anything personal or any girls. I don't to get into a fight, but I enjoyed it. I even getting hit hitting back like just the whole thing. I know for me fighting is a time I feel most alive and free in the entire world because I can go out there and do just about anything I can do with who I am and no one's going to try and stop me. Do you prefer

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       I'm old school rules rules? I prefer for those who don't know, super raw was soccer kids. Stomps. Had I prefer headbutts elbows? No. No, I understand. No gloves. Our gloves, they were, I think they were gloves. Do you prefer gloves or no gloves. I prefer gloves only for your own kind of fit but uh, or broken hands. But uh, not to say that it's really been doing much shinier hand wrote this. He's got a broken leg. A lot of broken hands. Nma. Yeah. Uh, but a super common, right? Yeah. Very. Is there any way around that?

Speaker 5:          01:14:47       It's hard to say. I don't know if it's an equipment thing. Is it possible to pad the gloves more or is it just that one thing I noticed and pride, there wasn't that many broken hands. Yeah, well I was asking that once too, and I was saying, is it a better glove? Is a pride glove, a thicker glove? Uh, not necessarily son I would say because it's all fixed fights. Oh, of course. Say that he's so crazy. Well, he said some of that shed about like the like pride fights. Like, come on man, you know, some of that is just,

Speaker 2:          01:15:18       it's brilliant stance to take. It's such a, it's such a fucking aggressive, just obnoxious thing to say someone is bound to get run now who's done or the person that gets mad at the person who says it, person gets mad

Speaker 5:          01:15:32       of course. But the problem is there's a wee bit a truth in the fact that some fights in pride. We're staged. So like if you look at Coleman Takata, it's pretty obvious or something going on there. There's a few every now and that. I mean, you look at like a cro cop, Nogueira. That's a real fucking fight. There's no doubt about it. That's a real fucking fine. But man, you watched Coleman tap out to that heel hooks from Chicago. Wait a minute. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:16:03       I mean it was ridiculous. It's not the best example of pride.

Speaker 5:          01:16:08       What was it like being. You were there in the golden era, man. I mean you were there during the time when pride was, in my opinion, like put on some of the greatest shows in mixed martial arts history to pride, openlink Grand Prix, the middleweight Grand Prix. I mean you just look at just the historic fights like minute Toro versus Bob Sapp. I mean there was some crazy historic fights from your era. That was a. You were there, man. You were there for all that shit. What was that like?

Speaker 2:          01:16:39       Unfucking believable dude was like performing for was the biggest crowd you did a biggest crowd ever fought in front of was $50,000. The biggest. The biggest crowd I ever stepped out in front of them at least grabbed the mic, was 93. Jesus to want to tell you how big it is here and I go, it is, and in America it's once it hits the media, the way American media is, things blow up in such a different capacity than they do in Japan, but man, we were stepping in front of $30,000 on a regular basis. I did a show with Hulk Hogan, you know, Hulk Hogan wrestling shown on 55,000 people and I fought a, you know, she thought, Gosh, independent my king of pancreas in the Tokyo Dome. That's. It doesn't. Those shows were on such a different level than what we see here in the states and the feeling of course feeling is going to be different in terms of the culturally it's going to be way different because you have Japan, this incredible homogeneous society with their ways and very specific versus America.

Speaker 2:          01:17:43       So trying to compare that sort of thing is not really fair. Apples and oranges really is. People are different everywhere you go hold those fights in Uganda or you hold them in Transylvania or what. They're always going to be different because people's cultures are different. A plaid, they felt so dynamic. Those shows, they were so big, it wasn't just the lights and that was the mood, the setting. When that music would start up and the lights would drop, don't, don't, don't, don't, and you're sitting in back and I'm fighting like ninth or something, but I'm all of a sudden I'm just wired, I'm ready to go. I'm like, let's just fucking grab swords and start screaming and running down the ramp.

Speaker 5:          01:18:24       A lot of pageantry to those events too. I mean, look, I did not appreciate it sometimes when I was like, just get into the fucking fights already, like six hours long and you like to be so jazzed up in the beginning, but looking back, man, when everybody would line up, you know, when they would introduce fighters one at a time and they would all line up, you're like, wow, this is going to be a fucking epic night. It really did build it up and it really did make it more of a special event. You know? I mean, the UFC, they've kind of done away with even some of the walk ins, like, well, we're pressed for time. Sometimes guys are already in the cage and there's no walking at all.

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       It doesn't even have walked in. Uh, I, I, you know, a TV product definitely changes things and in Japan they're TV system is way different than they, than we run out.

Speaker 5:          01:19:12       Joel, he'll deal over. I'll get burned. Yeah. He, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:19:16       he was a big fan of Michael Jackson's and he thought it would be real cool

Speaker 5:          01:19:20       to set himself on fire before he went out and fought. Not what Jerry curl before he lit up. Oh, Jerry curl has another thing that ever happened. And Pre ripped jeans. How the fuck did those exist? He'll got hit with.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       He was in the wrong spot. I don't know if the marker was wrong or he lost in translation and he got hit with some pyrotechnics and it just lit him up. Now. Thankfully he, you know, with the burns, he was able to, to come back and he even fought again in pride. Um, and so I'm really, really glad that, that, that was the case because you'll hear the Olivia and luke delivery legend school nhb dude at that. That's. Yeah. Sad

Speaker 5:          01:20:07       though. It's sad.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       I mean, for a lot of people don't know. He was one of the original guys back in the day, you know, he fought in some of those, uh, those, uh, valley to two events, the bare knuckle, no rules, events there were so crazy. Like when Gary Goodrich fought that Pedro grabbed this deck and they really reached into his pants, there was no rule against it. So reach into his pants and crushed his balls and his dick in his hand like no one had ever thought of that. No one had ever. But Gary went so deep, he literally grabbed the guy showed deep. Oh, Gary Good. Which is a fucking arm wrestling champion with these gigantic arms. And just imagine that that guy crushing your package. I think he might've started off with the tickle just to let go the underlings. And if tickle turned into a squeeze and see the guide, the guy didn't tap out immediately. It wasn't like saying giant black man hand in my crotch screaming, fuck no.

Speaker 5:          01:21:05       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:11       Finger and uh, you know, he was giving me a shocker.

Speaker 5:          01:21:14       Prostate balls were already numb. It's like he had taken so many. That's why. That's why he tapped out as Gary's. He's like knuckles deep and he's like, he's got two knuckles in there and he's going, you know what to do. Do you need to go get this

Speaker 4:          01:21:26       st if you know we're fighting a lot, we need to get you out of here. And he's like, thanks.

Speaker 5:          01:21:35       Thank you so much. Did, did you ever put a fight in A. I never stuck my nipples in a man's ass. Any event that allowed ball shots, like the old he attacked me, Joseph, you know, by the, by the time we were doing that, it was, you always sort of a universal like, dude, don't just, don't hit anybody in the nuts. Joe Simons a famous moment in mma

Speaker 4:          01:21:54       boom, and he's like a tiger choke on it. Especially when you,

Speaker 5:          01:21:59       you know, find out later that you know, joe is a fucking mass rapists and maniacs, crazy person, crazy person who was involved in a gang rape, you know, they caught him for something else and they did a DNA scan on him. That guy used to always hang around the comedy store. He was always in the back room and the comments that you'd run into him and he call everyone sir and like bout everyone. He was really weird. It was really weird. Yeah. And he have like no shirt on and he was like super yolked. Really short limbs but super. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:22:27       You'd be calling everyone now

Speaker 5:          01:22:30       this guy was like a mass or a gang rapists. You're like, Oh wow, what a weird guy to have hanging around about as bad as it can be, but I don't know. I would think that I would. I think he, in his mind he probably said his bar even higher than that. Did you ever try any of these compression shorts? A Cup? Things like videos of them, like shockoe has one and diamond mma have one. You know, I used to wear the 30 bucks everyone tour, but I also learned a hard lesson of if you're wearing. I see, okay. I also, I worry about like Tito trunks, right? So if you're wearing spandex trunks and you put spandex shorts on underneath that spandex and Spandex, just sort of all of a sudden your outer trunks are turned into some sort of daisy Duke Wedgie up your ass and then you're under trunks are hanging.

Speaker 5:          01:23:20       He just looked like a fun, sexy as shit. He was like, oh my God, look at that little. Those compression shorts is probably the best way to avoid a really bad ball shots where I keep it in place. Or is it a trap or Die Cup? I think if you use Taco jockstrap just trap with, uh, with uh, with one of those flexible cups because my, my thighs are so big that a normal cup, I just, it just starts digging into the inside of my legs. Those flexible cups are good. But these, uh, I've, I've tried recently. The reason why I asked this is a diamond nma has this really intense compression shorts setup with all of these straps and his videos, like are you sure it's for training and not for like, well, it's got a ball gag, but it's optional. The uh, the idea is that this guy has eliminated the movement, which is where the cup fails.

Speaker 5:          01:24:08       You know, the cup moves to the side and then you get kicked in the balls and the cup actually hits the balls, which obviously can happen if you just have a loose jock strap to the side. Yeah. His shit is. Yeah, there's no tuskie's from the side. This shit is slammed in place, but Kenny Florian says that a Thai Cup is the best. He says that you could if you. It's uncomfortable as fuck because it has to go up your ass like a g string. But if you do it that way, it's not moving. It's just sort of saying Kenny Florian isn't the mass play. I don't think he's into that man. I don't think he minds shaped inner thighs though. Steel Cup, like a little piece of leather around rather than balm and do is grunt. Yeah, you'd probably have to. Before you get going, you'll probably have to use some key and the size of your thighs a little bit. Kaggle's.

Speaker 5:          01:24:53       Okay. They can hear it. Okay. So here we're going off in the direction. We're talking a lot about cups. Yeah. Which is not entirely what I thought it was going to be on the table today, but it's a terrible design. The human body with the balls and the outside fighting. I mean we, you, you're a fighter, but if your involvement on the outside she couldn't like true lick them while you're adding. You're stroking it. Yeah. It's like a trade off. Yeah. I mean you gotta you got the good with the bad on that. What a ridiculous button that every man has his button seeing. Ding, Ding, Ding. It's out there. Everybody knows where it is. We're all running around vulnerable and we've made countless jokes about it. If you couldn't, didn't know that it was not only with the painful. It's hilarious. Yeah. Even when you're watching an mma about and uh, someone to get kicked in the balls, like, oh, one more time. Yeah, let's launch a few. Yeah, we always replay it. I don't know why. There's no reason to. There's got to be fetishes built around cups, I'm sure. Absolutely. I'm sure people like someone that where's the cup and gets a boner under the cup somehow. I don't know. It's like crushing is mushroom were dudes that like jerking off to guys.

Speaker 6:          01:26:09       Joseph, I heard your podcast. Joseph wasn't funny. What were you send them to me.

Speaker 2:          01:26:15       He should. He shouldn't really tell this story, but he was focusing on former UFC heavyweight champion, great, great kickboxer world kickboxing champion and trained in honor of a utility bill. Not a joke. So he's got this leather utility belt thing with pockets and pouches and all this shit and gadgets as monogrammed on it for multiple sclerosis. So it's not quite a fanny pack. Oh, it is the ultimate of fanny packs. It's Batman utility belt. I'm a little jealous. Well, he can get one made for you. I mean, he was pretty proud to tell me about where I'm like, I am actually mocking you. I'm not, I'm not asking for free for, for location on where I could have one of my own. You saw, I'm sure you saw Maurice, his last fight. Of course I did. I jumped out of my chair. I was losing my shit.

Speaker 2:          01:27:01       It was so awesome. And I, I know exactly when it was all going to go down hill. There was a point because I used to spar and race all the time and he's standing out in front of the guy and he kinda gets this little grin. I go, that's it. He's figured this dude out. He's got them handled. This only going to get worse from here and the more mode doesn't go for the kill. He's not like a get in there and just trying to annihilate you. Do he chopped you just score. Score. Score. Job Too hard. It's too hard to score. Score.

Speaker 2:          01:27:30       That's Maury Smith. So, um, so anyway, so he's, he's fighting say score, score, score score. If you, if you keep landing you're good. But you know, eventually I'll try to go for the kill. You set yourself up and you know, eventually, yes. Eventually the right shop will present itself. So you know the, he threw that right hand and step right kick. He knew the guy was going to take off to his left and the aid it and it was, oh his majesty. He was great in the first Coleman fight, man, whether when you really got a chance to see talk all that shit. He's like, oh, you hit like a girl and all this. And Coleman tried to punch them out and gassed and he just took his phone and he never got upset by it. All I was, I was talking to, me and him were talking before the fight and everybody thought he was going to his death and Maurice was, he was so calm. He was just hanging out back there with kirk the duties to train them and to transcend the mind. Settle down.

Speaker 6:          01:28:25       Marie Smith,

Speaker 2:          01:28:27       he's driving around in his porsche kickboxer old like read, done. He always had like 73 was like a little too much engine. The GTT kid on it or something. So anyways, he's driving around this porsche and I think somebody, he, he, I don't remember how he ended up getting contact with us. He was fighting, he was doing an extreme fighting and then he fight in UFC and this guy at a bus stop somehow he said, and he goes, Hey, I want to buy something off of you. And Maria says like, okay, he's like anybody with jock strap. Emory's had his stuff on him and he goes like 300 bucks,

Speaker 5:          01:29:06       documenter bucks takes off and is like,

Speaker 2:          01:29:11       you can do whatever he wants. What an idiot, you know, I ain't got $300. And you have now a Maurice Smith limited edition semen stained fricking jockstrap now like maybe the guys wearing it on his face, like darth vader, like it's something but something. And then it made me think, what is my jock strapless? What I sell it. Fuck yeah. How much

Speaker 5:          01:29:37       I'd like to get five fingers. Four fingers, thousand bucks. That's not impossible. You know what I think if you could take, well it's too bad. You probably already watched it from the great man. You know what? It'd be amazing plastic bags. I'm not saying you should fake this, but if you did have plastic bags where you structure your shock from the randy couture fight is in a Ziploc bag for medically sealed medically seal. This is the jock strap you were wearing when you won the title straps. Yeah. Only jockstraps. Yeah. Good. If you just had them all in a file at home. I'm not saying you should fake this, but if you did have like a file that you pull apart and it was filled with organized. How many fights have you had? No.

Speaker 2:          01:30:20       Fuck a unsanctioned. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:30:23       Included over 50. Could you imagine if you had 50 plastic bags filled with every jockstrap from every fight he'd ever been in, including some blood on him, some smeared, you know, some with quick knockouts where you didn't even really get. I'm stinky. They would have to be hermetically seal because of the smell is a radiator shops for, for, for like a 50 mile radius of pulling every woman and every feral dog. Shit. Coyotes at night. And uh, the like the MBA one would probably be worth the most because there's still like sweat inside the bag. Something like bubbles, some moisture bubbles in the bag, you know, we're like, yeah, go back to the pride days. Those are dried out right now. They've shrunk a little event. That would be somebody like, someone's going to do it now because we brought it up. We set that in motion. This is going to be sold. I got to pay for tires if I keep blowing up. So what better than to use a little bit of a laugh around my waist might be able to retire on this. I'm telling you, if you could just stop, you could, you would, you could retire on something as ridiculous as that sounds. The jocks job. Well, we should put up a thing. You got one more fight coming up in strikeforce, right? Yeah. When, how long has he been going to be before your hands healed?

Speaker 2:          01:31:43       Uh, I'm sure I got at least another three months. What do you have to do for like physical therapy when that happens? Did they put a pin in it? And everything, I'm going to have that removed at some point. Basically you have to have that removed or is it an option? No, I don't have to, but I think it's smarter in the long run to heal the stronger. That way a lot of people don't have plates in there on the plate is the problem. Right. And if it does break, if you break the hardware and that ain't got that crap stuck in the bone, it makes it even worse.

Speaker 5:          01:32:12       Put it all back together. What's a Nogueira situation like this? I think it's called a humorous. The upper bone snapped when a mere tapped him.

Speaker 2:          01:32:20       I think he just started rubbing off on it. They, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:32:25       his issue right now is the plane, you know, I don't know if they can go in and take it out though. Is it every fight? No, he pulled out of the Congo fine. He can, uh, he apparently is in intense pain during wrestling when he was fine for a little while. But then when it got to wrestling, it was just too much pain, I guess, that that plate, digging into your bones and digging into the army, I don't think you're supposed to. I mean, I think that has to be probably removed if you're gonna engage in sports. What about um, uh, mirrors, leg, whatever happened with that. Does he still have the plate?

Speaker 2:          01:33:02       And then I probably the prosthetic with a machine gun and so great hides his knives. He's still crazy, strongest dudes walking the planet and I'm covered in weapons, convert it. God, all the people that want to attack me.

Speaker 5:          01:33:16       Well, I don't know what that's all about, but he is the wrong dude to fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:33:19       Yeah. No. You know what, if he fell down a flight of stairs, he stabbed and stuff to death and shoot people. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:33:27       Got Two office buildings. Trips on the sidewalk. Ankle gun goes off. Oh, is the gas station across the street is dictate or just stats? Yeah. What's up with him? I was like, who's already a killer? And he wants to be like fully armed to the teeth when he leaves her house, he's like a real survivalist type. The

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       dude and that way you live in Vegas. I imagine his survival skills are a lot different than the usual guy. Like how do you avoid vomit on the street? And I didn't get into the Strip club without paying. When you work there, it's easy. But what? Vegas is a dark place though as far as like Vegas. I'm like, I hate Vegas. I don't like it because it's one, it's, it's, it's purposefully fake an engineered to fuck you up. Like even from the carpet from the way they did. I think it's kind of cool that they figured out the ways to make you gamble and spend money and fuck your life over to a scientist. Some formula like wow, that's pretty good. That's fucking cool. In a way, I just don't want it to happen to me. But then once you leave the strip, right? Leave all the opulence and all the cool shit that they're there, all the fucking things that they're dangling out there to pull you in and you get just outside the strip. Like every service industry thing around there is filled full of all the last great tea. Fucking prison, tatted, like wrangled up, fucking used condoms. Have people that, that all like lost everything in Vegas and they can't leave and

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       you know, you go and you order your, your sonic burger and you're like, fuck dude, I don't know what happened to you, but I that looks contagious and I don't really like, you know, seven like fucking snaggle tooth on one side. It's a strange, strange part of the news. Strange part of the country. Desert, desert. What is it? A desert miss? There's life in the desert. I've seen on that national geographic bullshit too. I know it, but not really meant for us. Yeah. You know who lives in the desert? Crazy people. Chromogens are Weirdos. We were actually talking about that before you got here were like the shit goes down. Vegas is one of the last places you want to be because there's no food there. They can't get food, so once the truck stopped coming in and playing stop landing with food, $6, prime ribs gone, all that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       Yeah, no money. There's no money for casinos. Said northwest. You can grow everything you need up there. That's the truth. That's the truth. I was watching the video. Chael sonnen preparing for Anderson Silva and it showed Portland. I'm like, God damn, that's beautiful. Go fucking green. Everything is green and healthy. I mean, you could have an incredible car. You'd have a serious problem. Portland, why all the people with the fucking disks in their ears? You'd be. You'd be off. Put all the other sizes. Not Sagging yet. I know. That's another thing. I don't get the bullring so many beautiful women have that. It's just like it should only be okay if you can attach a little chain onto it and drag them around. What's that? A girl or Tina Marie, didn't she? She had the nose like this thing go into the war to the ear, right number, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       Portland does have a lot of freaky people with those nose rings. That nose ring is so unnecessary. I've seen some girls nose ring and it's kind of sexy, like I did it a girl once you had a ring in or not. People can pull shit off, but they can't pull off that bull ring. That's pretty. I've never seen anybody. The other thing is chest tattoos on a woman is not my thing. Unless she's hot as fuck. I was so goal with the wings and I look at it, but I'm like, you're not a sailor apa fight or something like, no, you're not. So you don't know what you have tits. You have the greatest tattoo ever created for your chest. Yeah, the ultimate big fish, little tits, whatever. You got kids. You don't need to put ink on top of the tits. Leave the tits alone. Yeah, it's. Leave me to have the chest tattoos and the handlebar mustaches. It's why you brought this up. I have to write something down because I can't forget that. Uh, I have to make fun of my friend Bill Burr for using, uh, a Thomas Guide in 2012. One of those dudes like, he, uh, I loved the guys and awesome comedian, but he has a 1950 a, a pickup, I think it's got like the shifter on the column on the column and he got no navigation system. He uses fucking Thomas Guides and he's like, he's always joking around about it, you know, like using Thomas Guides know there's some people that refuse map. They get it,

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       they get a kick out of like ignoring antiquated to the level of difficulty. Yeah. You know, why people have maps because it was fucking hard trying to fucking follow the Falcon as it went down the road. And remember. No. So we created a map and I ain't went from a map. And this is your bed, I think actually about the whole, you know, and now you're going to go back to when you were living in some fucking dirt hole when you discovered you had a bathtub. Right. Look at how much of an advancement type. This is wonderful. I'm gonna. Have my baby in a bathtub and then you go from that and you have a hospital and then now all of a sudden like, no, let's go back into a fucking hole full of mud and have a baby in that because that's natural. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       Well that was me making fun of women want to have natural births like stupid somebody else. Yeah, no, I've heard that. Oh, that's his. Well, it becomes a thing man. When you are around a bunch of people, you kind of forget sometimes. Who was the one who said it, but it made the. It's funny, but it makes perfect sense. Like it's not, there's nothing. Okay. Having wine. I have a natural childbirth in some way or whatever. Like okay, I can. All right. Yeah. I get it on a beat where the WHO has the most likely chance. Exactly. Died constantly all the time. So now we have the ability to keep babies from dying. So why don't we do that? So it's the same thing. Like, okay, I understand using a thomas map or whatever, but that. Sorry, we have gps now and now if you have the Thomas guys because you're in case your gps fails, that's cool. Kids driving a three speed truck. That's all right too. Like that's

Speaker 2:          01:39:29       as long as you're aware of what you're dealing with. You're okay. I just drove up here in [inaudible] 69 while barely drove up here in [inaudible]. 60 nine oldsmobile, but I know what I'm dealing with and I'm okay with that, but I didn't drive up here with a fucking thomas map the whole time trying to do this. I used to have a 68, four, four, two. Used to have a lot of cool shit. I love that. So do I bet back that back bumper and one of the greatest bumpers in the history of automobiles, that giant chrome shying bumper. That's one of the reasons why I have this kind of car because I had a 300 CSR t a great car. It had been rear ended twice, so I never got any wrecks until I got to California. I'm on the six. Oh five. We get past this, this fucked up traffic and I start driving by and I see it fucked up car on the right, which is why we're also, I'm like, fucking California, you just can't go a day without having to run yourself into somebody else, like just fucking morons.

Speaker 2:          01:40:21       And we speed up and then started slowing down and I'm like, ah, fuck. I slow down, stop and then right into my back. Wasn't paying attention, of course not. And then they manage it, fixed the car from that. It's all good. I go and I pull the trim off, have all the chrome turned black and do all that and make the murder of the car looks awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to keep onto this for so many more years and then I'll finally get a new car and then I'm leaving at this place like 2:30 in the morning. It's been a good night for. And I'm on beverly and last Deanna. I just parked for four cars maybe ahead of me. Is that a red light? And I'm just chilling, like didn't even hit brakes. There's a ranger just plowed right into the back. I mean, you just annihilates the back of my car.

Speaker 2:          01:41:12       Was He texting? I don't know what he was doing. He wasn't drunk because the first thing I did is I got hit and at first I thought, Oh shit. It was a crazy boyfriend. Hit me like crazy ex boyfriend. Sorry. No, it's not that guy. Uh, and his truck and I looked over and so I see, I see. I see a truck and I got. Well the first thing is doing all this fighting shit that I've been doing high stress situations. I know I have way better facilities than your average person. Even today I'm driving in the fascinating 75 miles an hour and there's that wall on the one tab on the left hand side of the concrete divider and I heard boom. And it goes out and the car immediately tries to go into the wall. But I manage that by breaking the car.

Speaker 2:          01:41:52       Um, I'm applying brakes and feathering it and steering the wheel and keeping it straight. I didn't hit a fucking thing, you know? Oh yeah, like a man, like a man, like a man, Josh Barnett, that once I wrote that ditch and I fucked it, looked good and then ate it and then it. And then I became buffered and more sexually dominant. My prowess, my sperm count went up so long. We've been doing this almost two hours, an hour, 45. So I go and I get hit. Look, I see the truck, first thing I do when to get out of the car and I jog over to where the truck is pulled over onto the side. And then I noticed different truck come over, take a look, and I see these two dudes in the car and they're like freaking out. Like, oh my God, fuck, I can't believe I just did.

Speaker 2:          01:42:36       I can't believe this. They're upset about getting into an accident. Not Drunk at all. So we texted each other, even one of the two, maybe both at the same time, texting while blown each other, texting you about how good it felt to be blown away. It's just so awesome. Uh, so after that I'm like, you know what? I really liked the idea of having a nice allsteel car, so like, go ahead and run into this. See how that's gonna work out for you. That's true. That's one thing about those old cars, man. Naked. Take a fucking hell of a wallop. You can smash into stuff and you know, when I finally lose it and I just started going Berserk on the freeway and hitting people, then this is going to be the vehicle to do it. It's definitely better than like a prius. Oh, everything's better than, than a fucking Prius.

Speaker 2:          01:43:20       I assault you seen windows on the road tax. They're the worst because they can't even fit any luggage in the trunk headache. But I'm, I don't have anything against hybrid technologies or cleaner, safer burning stuff. Fine. Cool. With the rumble of the V eight. No, no you can't. And, and here's the thing, like if you want to drive that, go for it. You think you're saving the environment by creating a bunch of fucking shitty batteries that are going to pollute something somewhere. Then all whatever minerals from Congo. So, uh, anything designed that it's all a fucking scam. It's not, there's, there's been ways I'm sure that you could have the most fuel efficient gasoline powered car that we have no idea because every one of those things has been shelved on purpose by the oil companies themselves because what good would it do to you to have to buy less gas is probably a car that can run on water running.

Speaker 2:          01:44:18       So anyhow, uh, etc. These prius's and it's okay, but it has no soul hybrid cars have no souls whatsoever. I've driven a hybrid car and I'm like, well, you know, iT drives, it's a car, it's fine and does what it means to do, but I feel like I'm in a soulless, lifeless box and you sPend so much time, especially if you live in la behind the wheel. I want to drive something that makes me feel good about being in it. That makes me get out of bed in the morning and go to get my car and be like, god damn, if you were a chick I totally hit on, you know, and that's a 69 old does that. Well it's a grizzled girl, I'll tell you that. But she knows her way around the block a no, she, she smoked a about 687,000 cigarettes in her life and you know, now she's, she talks with some of those little fucking microphone dailies in her neck, but it's, you know, it's got personality and the car is not perfect and that's fine.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       You know, it's mechanically sound and it runs great and it's fun. And trying to explain the appeal though. It's of like one of those having like a v eight engine. It has. You turn the car over and it's got a sound. It's like, hey, what's up here? Are you doing? Where are we? What are we doing today? What do you want to do? My run some shit over. I want to go fast. What do you want to do now? We could just hang out, just fucking get on the road. It's completely different experience that corolla, even though corollas and french car come get you where you want to go. It's lacking that and this something that was captured in the creation of those cars. These cars are steel and they're solid. They're meant to last a very long time. They are and there are touches in terms of comfort and of just style that are so stupid like you didn't.

Speaker 2:          01:46:06       That's obnoxious. The you didn't have to create little emblems if some little fucker had to paint himself and then put them on the inside of the interior like no one's ever going to pay attention to half of that shit, but they did it anyways, you know, and they're like sinking the lights in in a certain way and having to put chrome around that bezel and going the extra mile, the extra 30 of mile that is, you're not gonna get in a car nowadays and be in that kind of. It's like going into those old buildings and seeing all those touches that they put into the flooring, into the mantles and you're getting that. But in a vehicle you can tell the difference between factory just churning out some, you know, four wheeled immobile to get you wherever and somebody even a, a factory line where people are putting these things together.

Speaker 1:          01:46:53       Do you appreciate a technologically advanced cars? Like, like a nissan gtr

Speaker 2:          01:46:57       bruised in the godzilla. Yeah. I think it's amazing that they can make over 4,000 pound car run that fast. I don't think it's quite that heavy. I think it's 3,930 8:50. It's heavy. It's very heavy. Four wheel drive, zero to 60 in less than three seconds. It's crazy. It's unreal or their car and then it'll do it. And in such a way that what my race or friends will telling me that almost any idiot can get behind the wheel of that car and learned to be fast. So I in fact in. So some folks were like, don't get one of those. I'm, well, I'm like, I'm not just sitting on a grant. I'm going to go run out and buy a car with, but okay, why not? And I go, you're not gonna you're going to get bored. You know, it's going to be awesome. It's going to this and that. And then eventually it's like there's no fun in this isn't it? Doesn't need to be. Well it doesn't scare the shit out of you. It doesn't come as everything. Yeah, it does everything and does it all well and it takes all the, the efforts and a lot of the skills out of learning and adapting to a vehicle and it takes it away. Well, you can take all that shit

Speaker 1:          01:47:55       off. You can shut off all that shit. You can shut off all that electronic control and treated like you're on a race track and then it'll scare the fuck out of here. You can go sideways on that car. Oh, I'm sure you can. Yeah, you just have to just shut off all those stability system. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:48:08       I love the car. I think it's one of the coolest cars on the road.

Speaker 1:          01:48:11       It's almost ridiculous to get anything else. If you wanted to get a car that goes fast, like that car, not only is it go fast, it's like it's super tech. It's like the most advanced technological achievement as far as like what we can do today to get you to go fast and safe. That's the most efficient

Speaker 2:          01:48:29       a car that costs three times as much. Right? Yeah. But then I, you know, I was talking to somebody about the difference. There's okay that gtr will do it, but when you get in that gtr and you look around and it is comfortable and it's got everything you need or if you get in that ferrari or that all of a sudden things, it's not okay. The ferrari isn't maybe quite as fast or maybe it's as fast, but you look at the way it was put together in a way to let it remain. But hands. I mean there's a huge difference there and I would have trouble with a frog is I would love to get behind the wheel, which I've never done and drive the shit out of one and treat it like, like, like, like that. It is totally true. She is all over.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       Yeah. But uh, um, it's too expensive. You just, you do that and all of a sudden the bill shows up for changing oil breaks, all that fun. And if you don't have the, the, the nomenclature that says you had it all done, then the value starts going down and like that's just too much fucking money. Which is also why I bought a sIxty nine olds cutlass. That is not a super special one. It's not super pretty. It's not perfect. So when it gets dinged, oh well, whatever. Well, that's one of the things I've always said why there's something to be said for like a corvette zr one. It's like what they've done is just

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       blown everything out of the water as far as performance. As far as zero to 60, it's right up there with every other car that's ever been made. Zero $60. Zero stops quicker than any car that's ever been made has got one of the most ridiculous norberg ring times, but it's like, no, the interior is friends. Good, but look. Okay, put all that shit aside. The fuck it's or works right? You hit that, that gas pedal, that's a real engine bitch. That's a 638 horsepower va that. That sounds like. Like like hell. It sounds like the fires of hell

Speaker 2:          01:50:25       world challenge a road racing for a, for a scca. They have a team of a cadillac and all those fucking cts bees. Those are ridiculous. They start rolling around the crack. They sound bad.

Speaker 1:          01:50:39       Fuck yeah. They just, they sound like even if they don't take first, they at least let everybody know that they were there. So beastly fucking car and if you, those ctsv are ridiculous. Like you can't believe you're in a four door sedan that's a cadillac, you know, and they were like 560 something fucking horsepower essentially the same engine. It's a deep tuned version of the zr one gesture and just hauling ass and you get in a wagon so you just take your kids in the back. It shows the g force on a wagon. We live in an awesome time as far as what they're, what's, what's possible too.

Speaker 2:          01:51:12       I think so I think our cars have come to such a different level. I love my, my gt $500 [inaudible]. It's such a bad ass car and my sponsors and everybody have helped me to make it even more gnarly. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:25       I have a gt 500. I have a 2011 convertible. What do you think? Fucking grave. But he's just an amazing car. It sounds so good. You could slide the tail out if you want to. You know, I mean it has some sort of traction control, but it's a fucking live actual car. It's fun. It's really enjoyable.

Speaker 2:          01:51:44       Yeah. Well I went and took all that enjoyable thing and then turned it into like a murderer. So why put a whipple supercharger on it? So it's 686 horsepower. I got kw and bmr for suspension. They, I braced the whole fucking thing up and have coil overs all around. And the wider tires. Not yet, but you're going to be. Yeah, no, a hrd is supposed to make the wheels for a, for the car. I'm just waiting on somebody to step on the brakes because it's going to be in the optimal ultimate streetcar challenges. Here I've got one piece, carbon, uh, one piece of aluminum drive line from lethal performance and like all this different stuff. And uh, I had somebody drive the car, I took the rear seats out of it. I pulled all the rivers, all the rear stuff out by this little deal set in a.

Speaker 2:          01:52:24       I've got to put a roll cage in a, uh, honestly. And I'm still taking weight out of the car. And doing the thing, but it's still, it's got the stereo in it, it's got everything. It's. I put these amazing recaro seats in the front. Uh, it's super comfy. But, and I've got this magnaflow exhaust all through these three inch pipes and I, every time I turned the car over, I mean I know that my neighbors are just like fucking rambling. Just a stock exhaust and the gt fIve fucking amazing. Now. It's ridiculous. It's one of the greatest sounds ever that the roar of a good va, great exhaust. And uh, I let I let this guy drive it and he goes, it's cars trying to murder you. I, oh yeah. Pretty much. I tell everyone it's a 30 slash 30 car in 30 seconds to 30 feet.

Speaker 2:          01:53:07       Some joe schmoe gets behind the wheel. They've wrecked it because it'll just go out from underneath you. It doesn't take anything to blow the tires on it. Way too much power for those back tires. Right? Well, kind of. Well the suspension, honestly, leaving a belt optima challenge last year. It's just watching. And I decided to go through death valley instead of. And then meet up with the 15 so it was just stretches of just empty road and I've got this little problem right now. I've got to sort that out. So I like to put the car in limp mode so I can't stop it. I can pull into stuff I pick, it'll cruise at 140 flat as fuck. And if you go into a 55 mile, an hour corner at 1:20 and just rolls right through it and comes right back out. I mean this, this suspension from kw and all the chassis embracing shift from bmr just has this thing rocked on the ground and I took it to this guy out in west la.

Speaker 2:          01:53:59       And Then this guy, tom can't remember the name of his shop, but at any moment you could have like $11 million with the cars all sitting around this place. It looks like a dump and you don't even know it's there. But he's fantastic with doing suspension and tweaking these cars out. And they set it up for my weight and everything and dropped it and lowered it and set all the suspensions. Your physical way because you're a heavier guy, right? So because you have to to, to adjust for that 250 pounds sitting in the driver's seat and how that affects suspension. So do they have like an asymmetric suspension? Is that what it is? Like one side is like at a different height or something? Yes, slightly to keep it basically is have your fat ass sit in there and then fucking adjust to adjust. And I take the measurements and then do the adjustments as need be.

Speaker 2:          01:54:47       And uh, my cat, my buddy chris from kw and he works with all the drift guys like dai yoshihara and all them and sets their suspensions up and everything comes up with trick, different ways of doing it. What is the whole drift movement? What is that about? Why do people like to go sideways and cars basically will one because it looks cool, right? It does look pretty, it looks fuckinG cool. I think I would call drift the different, like the combination of stunt driving and racing because they have to go fast enough through it. They've got to do, but they've got a. It's not just about going sideways because they do it in those tandems, so the idea is like to try and match your and get as close and as tight into any late. The guys run in front of you as tight as possible without hitting him, hitting the wall, hitting anything else, and doing it as fast and as skillful as possible. So I look at it, I'm like, it's just like a violent auto ballet.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       That's funny. That's a funny way. It's a really fun too. So they've got like djs and it's like a huge party the whole day. Long island auto belay, violent, automatic. How do they judge? It's based on judge on a speed. They look at the speed. They look at how now they have these clipping point things, so they've got these lights that will monitor up if you get within a foot of them with your car. So they measure how close you get to these clipping points. They also measure how closely you follow the. You hit the right apex is in lines for the drips, but also how closely and tightly you follow the guy ahead of you. The lead car in the fall and you're as the follow car, so a lot of crashes. There's a decent amount of wacky stuff. Yeah. ShIt. I mean, but they're not catastrophic.

Speaker 2:          01:56:27       But yeah, they, they, most of their body panels or title and zip ties, they just fucking rip right off. Oh really? Yeah. On purpose. We'll just so that because we have all these fucking zoots fittings all over the place, locked in there and it gets torn. No instead, now just breaks it some little spot and falls off real easy. So instead of tearing like a whole bunch of fairing off of the car or something and just tears off a little, like the bumper rips off and you can go ahead and fix that real quick and zip it right back on again. That's interest.

Speaker 1:          01:56:55       So there's sort of like altered them to deal with the constant collision.

Speaker 2:          01:57:00       Yeah. Well and like there are some amazing moments where someone's coming through a, uh, come up against the wall and they're, they're getting that back end out and they get so close with their back end, hits the wall just enough to fold it in. And when they come off, it pops back out. I mean, that's holy shit dude. You, you literally ran your car into the wall, but just enough that it was still okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       Okay. Well one day there's going to be. Every car is going to be like a gtr where everything is calculated to going to see things coming in

Speaker 2:          01:57:29       except it's not going to go that fast. And the governments can tell you where to drive.

Speaker 1:          01:57:33       That's going to be a real problem, isn't it? You know, I had heard something about, I don't know if this is a true story, I never really researched it, but someone was really driving really fast on the highway and the cops, um, called a, what is it? Onstar. And they shut the car. Is that true? Uh, I think that is, is that really possible? See, that seems to me to be. I'm not people getting aWay from the cops either, but I am not also for the fucking skynet. Shut your car off. Know that drives me nuts.

Speaker 2:          01:58:03       like if you have a problem, there's one thing is to, to, to deal with the problem. And then he is to take it so, so much further that all of a sudden everybody's freedoms are impinged. That's not okay. Yeah. The fact that I'd rather have to deal with cops chasing somebody down, even if it ended up in my house getting ruined because of it. Then having the big brother able to make everybody do everything the way they want to. Every time. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. And I was talking to this gal and she's going, oh, I would love it if cars start driving themselves. So they were talking about that magnetic system where they had the cars following and traffic and stopping and slowing down and you know, reducing accidents. And I think safety is great, but life is dangerous, period. We don't, we die everyday.

Speaker 2:          01:58:47       That's part of the time. Yeah. You know what cormac mccarthy talked about the, the, about everything is about games, uh, in this booklet and marine. And then he goes on about how it's, you know, games, men love games, boys love games, but what they love, the thing about a game that makes it more important or less is what's at stake. So war being the ultimate game because death is at stake if and that is the ultimate ultimate wager is life and it's true. If there was no consequences for the things that for a lot of the things that we did, there would be no that wouldn't have any meaning. Of course getting into the ring and fighting somebody with no consequence of injury or death or whatever wouldn't wouldn't hold nearly as much interest. It wouldn't have the same meaning behind it. And then it has to be very careful because the samurai fighting starts becoming really popular and do start actually sword fighting. Then people aren't gonna. Watch mma especially. I think there's a whole collection of sword fighting videos right now. I think it's put as a boy with cox. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:59:50       Do you think that there's a. That I could do? Well, I dunno. Was like night of the warrior fighting with swords.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       Is that possible for us to go back down to like the romans and the christians to the lions and all that stuff? Not yet. Not yet, but anything's possible. Right? I mean, come on, look it. Look at the way that the government is today versus where it was saying, and in the fifties or in the 19, early 19 hundreds, it's much more intrusive by far our, by far and, or just look at how radical tastes may change in terms of what content you'll see on television versus what you would see, let's say even in the most risky part of the twenties and thirties. Technology of course, always has a lot to do with that. You know, you have cameras and that anybody can use the shoe. So of course it's much easier to make porn than it was back in when you had an edison machine or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:00:49       Yeah, you actually had a day. You gotta you gotta have a good strong arm and you gotta you gotta have coordinates that jerk off and wind a wheel at the same time. Uh, but, but look at if you just turn into regular advertising, I mean, it's, it's amazing that there are just men jerking off on corners everywhere they go because there's so much sex being thrown at you all the time. The best way to sell. And uh, and how much we can get away with in terms of flesh and, and provocative, whatever and, and what. And we see these things as being an, I don't have anything against any of this, but back in the thirties, like people would have an aneurysm unthought of to see something like that and it just things progress. Now. Could things progressed to where people are really sort of fighting? I don't know. I suppose so. And they have to have a few natural disasters. People wanted to sword fight. Shouldn't they be allowed to? I think if they choose to do it,

Speaker 5:          02:01:41       if they choose to do it, yeah. If they choose to do it, if, if people want, they want the ultimate contests. I mean, it's not like if they don't do that, they're gonna live forever. There are temporary being if you choose to go out that actually

Speaker 2:          02:01:53       as a highlander, I have to sword fight to live forever. That's the only way, right? There can be only one. Of course.

Speaker 5:          02:01:59       Josh barnett. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bit of fun podcast, dude. Thanks for very much. My pleasure. Great to come back on. Oh please. Anytime. Anytime. Definitely. And when, so you said about three months before people can look forward to seeing you very much before you can go back into training.

Speaker 2:          02:02:14       Uh, hard to say I got to follow up on friday but I mean I've got good range of motion in it but I do want to take, I know that that's going to take a little longer to cut this back open and I don't like surgery. I don't want to get cut open. I don't want to go under but I just think in the long run it's going to be a lot better. So you have to do that soon and then you have to recover from that. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I, I'm even looking into like there's like what can they do for bone density, you know, nowadays and I mean this is my livelihood. I need to make sure if this shit doesn't happen again. What kennedy can you. I was having online about micro wars because there's any fucking. I think so those kinda, those cannot punch just about anything there.

Speaker 2:          02:02:56       And there's like chinese iron palm techniques and these people work on it and so it seems like it would condition your hands the war or those kinds of giant knuckles and it seems like that would help little. I've seen documentary the duties. He hits a little piece of steel everyday. Fu dude is legit, man. The guy he doesn't feel to look at doing something like that and like, you know, what forms of calcium or whatever. There was supposedly something called forteo out there which was a bone density drug. Really. They give it to us, throw the women with osteoporosis with high a likelihood of fracture. Wow. And it might be able to like a healthy person, jack up your bone density I suppose. I mean, the thing is we're losing bone density

Speaker 5:          02:03:37       day. Yeah. That is a problem with getting older, with fighting the power man, fighting it. Really

Speaker 2:          02:03:42       every, every cell that we have in our body is constantly being attacked and they will degenerate over time and can't live forever. But uh, when you, while you're here, you'd like to be able to use it as much as possible. Holding noman 34, 34. How much longer are you thinking of me throwing down so I can't tell. You can't tell the fucking fucking. Yeah, bloody my hands for the last breath. Be torn for me because as much as you fucking. This isn't the only amount of time you have in your life to do this and fighting is me. I am a fighting is absolutely a part of who I am, violence, a part of my life and that I'm. I've got a lot more to me than that. But being in the ring and being in war, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 5:          02:04:21       There's a lot of guys who say that and you go, okay, and do to keep convincing yourself. When you say that josh barnett is telling the fucking truth, that's exactly what you feel. That's exactly what you mean when you're saying it. You're, you're 100 percent committed and convicted to it. It's a.

Speaker 2:          02:04:36       And I told someone the other day, I go, when I go to the

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       ring, I'm already dead. I go to the ring is a dead person. I have no feelings. I have no emotions. I don't care about anyone, I don't care about anything. I don't care about my life anymore. I don't have it. I, I have a little set list of songs I listened to you in my, my hotel room before I go to and I, you know, like a couple tiers might fall from my eyes. I don't, without out any sound, just you know, just out of nowhere. I just, and I know that those tiers are for the life that I no longer own, that it is gone. I am dead now. I'm more into my life and is no longer exist. I am this, this is me right now. I'm walking the life of a dead person and the only way to go is to go out there and let's go to the death. It's just I have nothing to lose because I have nothing anymore. There is nothing. I feel nothing. I care for nothing. And in the middle of that, it's going to be the most intense feeling of all time. When you, when you're in the middle of the cage, like your last fight, the most recent will call me and you, you guys are both throwing down and and you both had broken hands at that point in time. It's got to be one of the most intense and realistic forms of struggle on her.

Speaker 2:          02:05:41       It is, but unfortunately that's where it's great where your corner man can, can give you that input to, to, to, to aim your direction because I got on there and broke my hand, made a couple fucked up a couple times in there and then all of a sudden I went into fight to the death mode, but it's not a fight to the death. It's a fight for five rounds. If you don't finish it in five, chances are on those. So I didn't really. I mean, yeah, people looking at you like, oh, you're like blonde blood out of your nose and just, you know, you're coming out. People never stopped coming forward and trying to murder. I'm like, right, but in front of three judges, a referee and five rounds, it didn't work. So I got paid less. And you know, think there's still a learning process.

Speaker 2:          02:06:28       It is, and I know it's, it's a, yeah, it is a learning process, but I know that for me, being like that feeling that way, that's, that's there's days I feel like most of the time I feel like that's the way I really am. That's when I get my strip off. Everything that society has imparted on me and him and parts on me like pushes on and be like that. I throw it all away and it to. I tell you what, feeling like your dead is pretty free. You really feel free. You've never appreciated life more when you've already given it away.

Speaker 1:          02:07:08       It makes sense. Yeah. That makes sense. It's as intense as things can get. There's no, there's no other way. Right. I mean that is as intense. It's nothing other than actual war itself, you know, there's nothing more intense.

Speaker 2:          02:07:23       No. And uh, it, it also, I think, you know, you start getting a bad. It's like the, I'm gonna try and do something. You just do it. If there's something that must be done, you do it. You just do it. And uh, you can, you don't, everything doesn't have to always be to the level of know, um, you know, the walking dead and, and I don't have any emotion or feeling anymore. I had a girl I was in love with, break the living shit out of my heart as soon as I had to go off over to Japan and I had pro wrestling matches to do and stuff and I'm destroyed inside. I'm totally ruined and I'm giving press conferences and shit like that. And you know, they need to see a hero. But inside I just feel like a piece of shit, you know, I feel terrible and I'll go out there and wrestle.

Speaker 2:          02:08:04       Matt and I had a wrestling match in front of 12,000 people and make it look amazing. And I did and we fucking, we tore the house down. But it was a, it was like, you know what? You feel like death right now. You feel like the lowest form and your heart is so broken, but nobody paid for that. So it doesn't really matter how you feel. Right now you have this in front of you. And this must be accomplished and you can anybody make, excuse you for cIrcumstances, but that's. No sorry. There really is no excuse. there is only the result and only you know, whether you do it or you don't.

Speaker 1:          02:08:42       What's it like for you to see guys that you came up with? Guys like pedro, his own that have reached pretty much the end and you see the end and did, do you, uh, do you take like a mental account? Dionte

Speaker 2:          02:08:57       have there ever been training even because I'm tired of getting hit in the head by fucking monsters that are in there. And I just, I know that part of the reason I tried to read as much as I do and I do want to Be a more, well everyday that I have a chance to be a better person and learn more and be, have a broader sense of this world at large, um, is necessary. It's important. I think that's part of my, uh, not just right as a person to do so. But I think it's a necessity. Like you, you should have to do that. Uh, but it's also the stable way, the effects of that kind of shit of dementia and whatever. I mean I'm getting mad and practice constantly and then I go in the ring and get hit in the head some more and, and it damages your brain.

Speaker 2:          02:09:44       There's no way around it. Some people are more susceptible to the side effects of it, of catching pugilistic dementia and the different becoming punchdrunk and, but I know that there've been times where I find myself trying to catch a word and I'm like, I don't know why I can't think of that right now, but that's maybe, maybe it's because I'm getting hit in the head by eric prindle who's 300 pounds, but so why not just save it, save that brain so that I can use more of it and even I'm still going to be getting hit in the head no matter what headgear I have on me. But, uh, I don't want to take things to the point where I've made a disability for myself mentally or physically with fighting. uh, do you think you'll be able to discern that? I think I'll be. I think if I'm honest, I will, um, and, but why watch guys like pedro can't take a punch like he used to and part of me feels bad when you know, I, I do feel sad for that, where they're at now compared to where they used to be, but I'm also more so happy that they are here on this earth, loving their life, still being able to exert themselves in the ring and be a part of this.

Speaker 2:          02:10:58       And if they decide to retire or when it comes to that point, they need to retire. That they did it, that they had the opportunity to live that life. They took those experiences into themselves and they can stand there in front of anybody and go, I did this. I made my mistakes. I had my success is I did this. I did it with everything I got. And you know what, you can't take any of that away from me ever. It's all mine. And I earned it. And that's beautiful,
