Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Two one and we're live. Hello Gabby. Hello. How are you doing? Good, thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Thank you for having me. You're looking well, thank you. You are as well. I uh, I really enjoy following you on Instagram. You have a very positive Instagram page. It's full of information. It's beneficial. It's great stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Thanks. I, uh, you know, I'm, I feel like I'm trying to figure that out. Like for a younger person it's like, oh yeah, well this is how you do it. And for me I'm like, well what do you really want to say? And I don't know. I think sometimes I, I would like to take more chances, but I do play it probably safe. How so? Like in what way? I try to be pretty honest, but sometimes you're always very aware that you'd just amount interested in getting roasted or spending a lot of time and energy in a, a hassle with somebody. So I think when I'm doing it, I'm as honest as I can be, but it's also, I'm aware of that. What do you hold back on? Like what kind of stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       I think for me it would just, maybe you'd just be more even maybe more direct, but you're, you know, I think when you're trying, when you sort of say, okay, I'm going to occupy this space professionally, that feels good to me. And like I want it to be overall pretty positive. You know? Like if you're selling something, like maybe I'd like to try to sell something positive, but hopefully towards the honest a little bit. And sometimes when you're doing that, you're also aware that like you're not as harsh as sometimes your inner voices. And so you go, well, am I not being completely honest and transparent because I don't really want to deal with it and I, so I'm just saying, you don't want to deal with feedback. Comments. Yeah. And it's, and it's also just people who are frustrated or, or, or also they're not getting maybe the nuance or the subtlety of what I'm trying to say. Let's just say that social media is not the place for

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       subtlety. No, not in the comments for sure. Right, right. So I just, I want to do stuff that seems like that seems authentic. You know, pretty real, but hopefully skewed towards like either fun or something positive. Mm. One of things that I've recognized from doing a podcast is the, uh, some of the frustration when people do lash out and you're like, this is like out of proportion. Some of it is due to the fact that it's very frustrating to just not be a part of the conversation if you disagree with, when you're listening to just the fundamental, the, there's the act of listening to someone have a conversation and something comes up and you're like, but what about that? That's a great point. Say that. And it's like this, you get stuck. Yeah. It's get angry. So then we leave it a shitty comment. I'm like, oh, that guy's a dick. But it's point, his frustration of not being able to communicate,

Speaker 2:          00:02:49       interject. It's like your kid who'd be like, hey, hey, hey. And they never get to in. Yeah. That's a great point. I think you've probably been tempered by doing this and have probably looked at it from a lot of different points of view because you have to, yeah. You have to. I've tried. No, it's, it's been interesting to like watch you over the years. I think what's interesting is watching you have an interesting place where you keep your own, you sort of keep a level of neutrality even though you have an opinion. So you let other people express themselves, whether it's about a religion or a vaccination or whatever. I think that that I, it's been interesting to see like you develop that skill even more.

Speaker 3:          00:03:32       Well, it's hard for people to express themselves as it is. Like live on a podcast is difficult. It's harder still if you don't allow them to. If you interject, and you know as well as we all know that when someone, when you have something you're trying to say and someone talks over you, it's fucking frustrating. And when you trying to formulate these words than someone butts in and then you lose it, it's hard. So that's one of the key skills of learning how to communicate with people that we think a lot of people lose is the ability to listen. You know? And also you have to have a good enough memory so you can hold on what you were going to say and then allow this person to elaborate on their thoughts and then when you give them the respect and allow them to elaborate on your thoughts, hopefully they'll return that favor and they'll allow you to elaborate on your thoughts and then you'd get a much more balanced conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:04:18       But there's so many people talking where they're just talking over each other and shutting each other down or taking the conversation into a weird place. It's just I'm the only way to find out how someone feels about something is to let them express themselves and if people get mad that I don't push back, that's not always the best way to find out how a person feels. You got to let them let them talk. I want to know, I want to know the whole thing. I want to know as far into this as you can tell me why you think this. Like instead of me just saying, no, you're wrong. I want to, I want you to explain it to me. I want to know whether or not I trust your process.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       Do you bring that scale home with you? I mean, you're surrounded by women. It's trough. It's tough, bro. I, I, I'm serious. Like sometimes I, cause I even see it with my own husband. We have three daughters, but I mean, especially, you know, when you have a pretty masculine male, I'm always fascinated to watch them navigate their home when they're surrounded by women.

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       I just give up. Most of the time I lose every argument. Um, I think, um, you know, I tried to, we communicate a lot, lot of talking, a lot of get upset with girls. It's always there always things they're crying about and you're like, okay, okay, okay, we're going to be fine. And you know, I don't want them to be like me. I want them to be themselves and I want them to be girls. I want them to be able to be themselves. I don't want them to mirror my resilience, you know, I want them to be vulnerable if they want to be vulnerable. But it's a, in terms of like how I decorate the house or any, I don't have no say, oh no.

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       That's why you have, you know, I have this place. I was going to say, you have your, your cave here at Laird has a barn. Perfect. And He, you know, when he meets young guys getting married, he goes, here, I'm going to teach you. Okay. You're right honey. I'm sorry. And Oh yes. Whatever color you choose, you know, always work. Some people it's never enough, but if all that is the right relationships, sometimes it'll work that way because I don't give a fuck what my house looks like. I really don't know. I have a good view. Where's the coffee? Yeah, real work. How's the bed? That's a good bed. Do we have a TV? Where's the TV? Is it a good one? Lots of good TV. All right, we're good. We're good. I have a laptop. Okay. We're good. Yeah. Yeah. I don't need that much.

Speaker 4:          00:06:37       You know, so like when my wife's like, I want to put this here, I'm like, okay, put it there. Fantastic. I want to get that painting. Okay. Get the painting. I don't know. I don't know where you want to put it. Put it where it feels right. I don't give a fuck. I think it's smart. I mean, you know like sometimes if I am fringe on, if it's functional then layered steps in like you know that's not really functional, but otherwise he's like, I'm tearing some stuff out of my house right now and he just gives me a look and I'm like, I'm this age if I want to do this, support me. And he just laughs and walks out. He just probably doesn't care. It's in the way. Whatever it is, whatever, have fun with it. Yeah. What Time's dinner? You know, and love to decorate things. I get nervous if a guy's really into it. Well yeah, it's a nesting track. Guys are like really into like the design in their own house. Like really, really into it. Like constantly obsessing about where things are and where I supposed to call those homosexuals. Yeah. I can't plow. Yeah. What do you mean? Is that a stereotypical thing? That is outrageous. What? He's not racist. That might be, he might have showed you white supremacy.

Speaker 4:          00:07:45       Yeah. It's a funny thing. Right. But, uh, if I didn't have this place though, I don't know if I, like traditionally men had pool halls they could hang out at or gyms that they would hang out in and they would get their dose of toxic masculinity. Her basement basement. Yeah. You kind of take you to a place where nobody's touching your stuff. Yeah. Well if you live in a house, like I do with all girls too. It's, it's just everything's girly. I just, whatever. I'm fine. [inaudible] said he, he's like, I need it to be more specific. I said I want it to be surrounded by women. I didn't mean to be related to all of them.

Speaker 4:          00:08:23       That's hilarious. It's, I think it's a nature, God's way of balancing off. They say if guys have elevated body temperature, so athletes, people train a lot that they're statistically have a greater chance of having daughters because I think they hot, we call it hot balls basically, if he kills off the male sperm. That's hilarious. And if you look around, I think so they did a thing on a bunch of guys, either in the NFL or whatever. And statistically they just have a lot more daughters. And I think it's like nature's way of going, oh, you're going to be all like moving and active and raw and all this stuff. Guess what? They're just going to put a bunch of girls around you for you. Because my daughters say things to my husband. I could never say as a wife, you know, it's like I see it and I just go, oh yeah, well they know that for sure.

Speaker 4:          00:09:15       He loves them. So they carried away with it. They're in, they can't get fired. No, I always say that to them. My youngest daughter, when she was really little, like five or six, she'd say, okay, so I'm not really clear with this. Um, when I have alone time, I'm by myself. And when you and dad need alone time, like you're together. And I tried to like, well you know, it's important for moms and dads cause you know, we have to work at it. I go, you know, you're, you're always going to be dad's daughter. I, you know, I'm, we're working at being a husband and wife and a then she'd keep going with it. And um, I finally, it would just say like, Hey, do you want to have Christmas in separate houses? And I'd see her thing for a second, like, well, maybe, you know, and I'm like, we need a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:09:57       I get to present. That's what I mean, she's processing that. She's like, I miss you, but I dunno. You know, so it's all that dance, you know, cause daughters, man, they don't miss a trick and they're on you and they're on their dad like nobody's business. While my friends would have sons, the way they say it is, it's like you take one of two things. Either you have this wild animal that's tearing things apart or you have someone who's screaming and crying about something you don't understand. Yeah. Take your pick. You want until judo mental destroyer or a physical destroyer. Yeah. Walls with holes and broken, broken bones. Boys and girls. It's like I have learned so much being a mother, two daughters, and I've been around women my whole life. You figure playing volleyball and being around tons of women, it's very different as a parent.

Speaker 4:          00:10:41       I mean I've learned the most, especially teenagers. They're watching them grow so strange. It's such a strange experience watching a person figure out the world from, from jump, you know, like out the womb, figuring out the world. It's so educational. I feel. I don't think everyone should have children. I'm not one of those zealots that tells everybody, Hey, you're not alive until you have a kid. No, I think it's unfair to say that to people. That's unfair. I think it's first of all, a lot of people can't write and maybe they have a just a different path. Like I always tell my girlfriends too, like it's unfair also to romanticize like to your friends who either opted not to have children or whatever, met a partner too late or didn't or whatever. Because I think it is a really rich, I mean there's nothing like it.

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       I mean, I love my children, but if I have one friend, she was like got married later and she's like, you know, we're going to adopt. And um, she was also doing a new business and I was like, listen, I need to come, I want to talk to you. And she also liked to consider taking naps occasionally. I was like, if you think you're going to adopt and like you're going to have a 12 year old that's like a, hey, I really appreciate you guys. Thank you so much. I go, that's not what you know, like if you think you're going to have a kid

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       and it's gonna make you happier, that's not what having a kid is. I think it makes you, it makes you know yourself better in a different way and you can adapt and do something different. But I think when people sort of sell that bill of goods, like, oh, you got to have kids. It's like, well, do you want to have kids? You know, I think it's like you said, not for everyone. You definitely shouldn't adopt. You think it's going to be easy. That's what I mean. It's like she had this romantic idea of like, and I go, you know, you don't, first of all, you don't know what the, what's where the kid is coming from. And then also you have a romance. I think every parent going into it has a romantic idea. I did. And I'm a pretty realistic person of like, I'm going to do all these things right and it, we're going to be, you know, running in sunflower fields together and my kids are never going to think my music sucks or I can drive. And then you realize, I had a friend tell me, everyone gets their turn in the barrel no matter what you do. Uh, you got, you have to navigate stuff you're going to,

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       to deal with stuff for sure. And on the other hand, it's awesome when someone does adopt people, if they're really into it, if they know what they're getting into and those martyrs out there and those people that are just super kind and generous and love to adopt children of God bless them. So glad they're there. It's just, I agree with you that there are some people that have a romanticized idea of what it's like to raise a child and it's unfair

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       to to sell it. Like, I loved the mom check what? So when are you going to have number two or whatever to somebody it's like, oh, you know that they're behind closed doors doing, you know, like they just want everyone to be in the psychotic ness with them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       I have three kids. You should have three kids. You know, there are people like that, right? They did this. People that have a kid then immediately take this moral high ground. Like so like they're doing something, they're an adult and you're, you're just a fool. You're layer. I wonder who is the fool? I ask myself that sometimes. Well, don't you think you're a better person for raising kids? Do you, does it make you feel like you're more in tune and nicer and just more aware of what it is, what it means to be a human?

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       Yeah. I not only that I, I feel like, I feel like it's, it's a forced exploration. If you're trying to participate, like if you just lay down the long go, hey, in this house, this is how we do it, then you're not doing anything. But I think if you, you learn to adapt and also go, wow, I was doing that wrong for like 10 years. Amazing. You know, like I've, one of my daughters, I had 12 or 13 sort of revealed some stuff about what she was unhappy about, about my parenting and I was like, God, I've been doing that for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:14:36       Uh, so I think it's cool that she had the confidence to do that though. Yeah. It's so cool. I wanted to hear that. Like when she was 30 at the Thanksgiving table, she moved out. I was like, what? You're supposed to reveal all that like after you move out and then I go, oh, what did I do that? Sorry. It turned out great. It's amazing. What time's your flight? Uh, no. I think no, listen, it's a, it's a surrender. I think for me it's been a real surrender because I, I just think I, you think you're in control of stuff and you think, oh, I've got some discipline and work ethic. I just work my way through it or power my way through it. And then you realize like, no, you have to surrender. And, and also it's not just about solving it quickly and, um, yeah, it is.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       I'm, I know myself certainly better, but also it forces you if you're willing to, to really expand and it's, it is uncomfortable. Well, I've been really fascinated by the life that you guys live in Hawaii because I've always had this like idealized, like one day, like moved to the big island, just chat on the side of a mountain, stop fucking out, fly out to do gigs, but live out there where everything's just more relaxed. Yeah. Know is it okay? You know, there's a lot going on and like the Big island is obviously big city. Yeah, no, it's been a while. It has, it's sort of like la on the beach, but you know, there's a couple things I think because it is a primal environment like we live on quite, which is pretty heavy duty as far as, um, it's quiet. There's not a lot of distraction.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       There's a really heavy duty nature. And um, and so I, and I grew up in, in St Thomas on the Virgin Islands, so I was used to kind of being on an island. But it, you're, you're with yourself a lot, so if you have things to do that are, you know, productive, then it's perfect. Um, but what you have to always calibrate is like, um, the downtime or it like, it's been raining off and on for like over a year on Hawaii. Whoa. Yeah. So after a while it'd be like Seattle in that way where people, it starts getting heavy, but it's sunny too, right? It can be, and it's the weirdest thing about the islands. Yeah. There's different climates on this island. The Big island has desert. Yes, it has tropical rain forest is a volcano. There's all this shit in a snack. Every, I think it has every, uh, weather climate, except Arctic, I believe at least Maui and the big island have sort of every type of climate.

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       It's crazy that just a little bit further down. It'll be different. It'd be raining constantly. Yeah, exactly. Or You just go the other side and it's completely dry. Or they have dwarf trees because they never see the sun, but then they're, you know, 200 feet in the places that it's sunny. It's, it's pretty trippy. And you could drive around the whole thing and like how many hours does it take you to drive on the Big Island? The Big Island? I don't know, like four hours or something like that? I think so. Maybe a little more. Yeah. You like the big island. Love it. Interesting. I like Maui. You do? That's my favorite. Every island different. They're all, their personalities are different, but I like it. I mean, we've been doing this for over 23 years. When I met Laird, he was big waves sort of come in winter. So when low pressures brings snow, like to the rest of the mainland, that low pressure can also bring big waves.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       And then my season was summer, so we sort of went back and forth. And that's a really good blend because then you can come to California and be like, oh, it's a busy world. I can see a lot of people. I can learn stuff, I can do stuff. Um, and then I also makes you appreciate when you go back to Hawaii, you're like clean air, really clean water, very beautiful place. Um, some of the ways, the ideas about the way they live there, it's, it's simple in a good way. I don't mean that in any way, like a derogatory, it's like they're not trying to, they're not angling and trying to get somewhere. It's like, no, we're living right. Um, but it can be also a very, a really hard place. Really hard place. Well, I think, you know, and you're also talking about a warrior culture, right?

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       Polynesians. So you have like this, this very intense love. And, uh, you know, when they talk about the Aloha spirit generosity, they ha like this. And then they're very powerful people as well. And sometimes if they're living, not living as they're in their most natural way that they were supposed to, and then you couple it with, um, you know, there's not a ton of opportunities there. It's hard to live there. It's far away. It's expensive. Um, and, and sometimes, uh, you know, it sounds Cliche, but it's like we really do as human organisms either need to be busy, so like, okay, working from sunup to sundown for our food, which is how it used to be, and then you're just so tired, you just go to bed and it's pretty simple and let's just survive it. Or in the world that we live in now, it's like, how do we get people doing things that are kind of productive?

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       And, um, you think, oh, I just would sit on the beach and look at the mountain. And it's like, yeah. And after a while you get bored. And if you're a warrior, you're either gonna go, you know, do something with that. That is good for you or you might not. So, um, I think there's, there's a lot, a lot of that there, I've learned a lot from that culture. Um, but I mean, they're pretty powerful. They're powerful group and, uh, you know, it can go the other way pretty quick where it's, you know, if there's drugs and alcohol are beefing and like it's all that. So it's, that was really disturbing. I found out how much drug abuse there is on some of the islands. Yeah. Crystal Mathis especially sad. Well it's, it's, again, it goes back to the board and like thinking about when your kids have to stay home for one day.

Speaker 2:          00:20:40       Yeah. You know, it's just, and now we have all these, the internet and all this stuff, so now you, you sort of think, oh, the rest of the world has a perfect, they're all busy and doing fabulous, perfect things. And um, and it's hard. Like you got to find people that you're like, let's do something. Let's go. I mean, can you train alone every single time now? So you'd have to have a tribe of people that are like, let's go do this activity. And sometimes they don't. It's not that easy. Well, so there's, there's just say there's 70,000 people on the island on [inaudible]. He's probably the least, uh, inhabited, it's the oldest island, so it has the most erosion, largest beaches. Um, and that's where Larry grew up. And it's a, it's a, it's a really denies the loose inhabitant of the islands, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:21:27       Well, yeah. I mean I don't, it's not that I don't count it. Yeah. I mean, of the bigger islands. Yeah. Molokai, man, you wouldn't, you don't, you don't mess with Malkai. No, no. That's like, that's like you, but you got to ask permission to go hang out over there. I'll Kinda, yeah, it's cool though, cause it's like, if, you know, if they'd be like, no, you gotta, you can't, you're out. You got to go. Really. Totally. So it was great. Is it's just the people that live there, you can't like move to Mollica. Yeah. I mean like, you know, I had, Eddie Vedder has a place on Molokai. Yep. And has had for many, many years, but I think he probably asked if that was going to be cool. Oh Wow. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, it's, and it's beautiful. Do you have some friends that just went hunting there?

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       Yeah. Beautiful access to here. Yeah. Yeah. It's a beautiful place and the people are amazing, but you, you, it's not like, oh, I'm just going to buy a house there or build a house. There's no way. No Way. No Way. Wow, that's interesting to do. All these different islands have their own rules. Well, Niki out is a, you can't even, you can't go there. No, I didn't even know that was a, an island. Yeah, it's off of cooperating Nikki. I'll give her that. Jamie's big fan of, he looks like he's mentally, he has none of that. It's all like, they probably have the, uh, the, you know, the largest percentage of pure of Hawaiians there. So it's cool. I mean, pretty good. It's got to be a great view. I've found that like, there's a big difference between the, the, the culture of say Maui versus the culture of Lanai.

Speaker 2:          00:23:00       Lanai is more island d to me, whereas Maui seems like little bit gentrified. We'll also, the wind cause it Maui, so windy, it brought all the Europeans in the 80s to wind surf. So you're also have not only mainland us and then Japanese culture, you know, eighties now you're talking about Europeans for wind and wind surfing. So it has a lot going on. I think Maui, it was almost like a surprise how quick it developed and they never had a chance to get on top of it, if that makes sense. That does make sense. Yeah. It's so populated and it's also like, so, um, it's so la Beverly Hills, I lived there for 13 years with layered. Yeah. There was a wave there that Laird was having a love with for many years. So we lived there, uh, with, you know, so he could be close to his girlfriend for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:23:50       It was strange. It didn't know every boy needs is their girlfriend. Every boy needs a wave. They do. Well girl, you know, just something, that's what I always think is kind of natural is at least for my experience is like, I don't know if he ever go through this. When you go home I'll Laerdal go out and surf for many hours, like kicking off for five hours at a time and if their surf and he comes home and I see how happy he is, like to see us, like he loves us. He's like, oh my girls, you know. And then about, I dunno, seven and a half, eight minutes in, he starts to get this look on his face like, oh yeah, I'm in the house with the family. You know, I want it to do a book years ago called death by domestication because it's like how does, how does, how does he manage both of those sides? Like, I need to go, I need to be free, I need to, you know, chase things and like scare myself and do all this stuff and then, you know, comes home and he's like, you know, on the floor laying, you know, with one of my daughters and, and being attentive and a great husband and all these things. But I always get amused a little bit by the,

Speaker 3:          00:24:58       yeah, well especially I think with the big wave surfer mindset, like a type of person, those are like some of the freest, wild as humans on the planet. It's a very unusual group of people that rides giant waves of water on the top of the ocean. I mean that's a, that's a crazy thing to delta here time to really stop and think about it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       I try not to think too much about it cause I did marry him, but I, there's some stuff, I mean and, and weirdly, you know, he's been doing this so long that you realize hit, he's actually even more different than some of the other guys because if you think about it, he sustained doing this for right now, 40 years. So he's a guy who he has both. So what he wants to do is write a huge wave during the day and then be with his family at night. And sometimes, you know, it would take going halfway around the globe or whatever. And so I think the pursuit and they have to wait a lot. That's the other thing. These things don't come around that often. Right? Um, it's, it's very interesting to live with because, um, there's a, there's a little bit of suffering that goes on and sometimes layer it will say to me, cause he's aware of time going by, he'll be like, you don't have a lot more waves.

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       I need to ride. And I'm like, I know, like it's a pretty deep, uh, calling. And now that, I mean he's been foiling for 25 years, but now that they are getting that equipment better, it's sort of like now we can ride places that we couldn't ride, that we're not really attractive for riding on top of the surface of the water, even if you towed it. So now it's opened up a whole other pursuit for him. Um, yeah, it's very, I know why you would go towards that. Like Laird has put me on a ski in front of a way that's like 60 feet. Right? And like being on the back of a ski with him driving, there's a moment where you go, okay, I actually, and I'm sure you've experienced this with other friends that take you maybe on up flying or something. He is, this is what he does, right? So I'm like, okay, I trust him more than I'm afraid. That's fine. I can do that and I'm going to surrender to that. I'm not going to torture myself the whole time. I'm just going to trust him. And you turn and there's a six story building behind you moving

Speaker 4:          00:27:18       and you just think, who would, who like, well how has that fun, you know, like how is hang like I'm going to actively ride that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       But now what the foils, because they're actually catching the energy below the surface of the water. So foils, I'm not familiar. They have these things called the hydrofoils. So originally there was a guy named Mike Murphy who created something called the air chair. And they were, they'd been putting foils on skis, water skis, and different funky ways. Like even in the 50s so layeredness friends got an air chair, cut the chair off and put us snowboard boots bindings, quick release. So you'd stand on it. You're booted in and below. Is this basically a mini airplane with a Strut? So for example, yeah, there's a shot of one and this is a smaller one. Jamie, do you have any ones of the big with the boots? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       Larry. This is what people are using the old time memories. Do you know what about this? I seen him. Wow. He knows about everything. What are you talking about? He's plugged in, plugged in, look at them. Do you have a girlfriend? Well, what happened to this dude's head? Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       So there's layered on the left obviously. So you see how he there in the boots and also he, the reason it looks so puffy as he has flotation underneath his wet suit. So if you hit your head or what have you, but it's basically a miniature airplane underneath the surface. And if he gets into trouble, if they wiped out, um, they have a quick release, but now they've gotten this developed so that he can do it, uh, without the boots because that adds an element of danger that cause you're strapped in, you're strapped in and your strut is, you know, four feet long. Uh, you know, that's so strange looking. Yeah. But it's what's going on below the surface. So there's a miniature airplane. Do you have, Jamie, do you have any pictures of it flipped up? I'm sure if you look on Laird stuff, you can see the bottom, it's like a miniature airplane because water is denser than air.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       So it's sort of like a miniature plane. And it is like the oracle guys that do those boats do have made foils for Laird. Um, it's, so that's what it looks like. Yeah. So those are kind of more a low performance ones. When you see the high performance, they, I mean, you know, it's aerodynamics. It's all of that. So now what you're doing is because w there's energy below the surface moving. So we think of a wave like pushing and dropping. But there's actually the energy, circular energy below. So now you've got the foil that can ride that and, but you're not, you don't have drag. So like they can go, there's a wave on [inaudible] where they're going over, you know, 50, they go about 50, they can go get up to 52 miles an hour. So imagine if you did something, we'll, you've dedicated yourself to martial arts.

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       It's like, but then there's like a new way to do it. And so he's been doing the big stuff for 25 years, but now they're using the equipment right. That he can ride ways that actually wouldn't be that great. But now they're super fun. Oh Wow. So he gets it, makes them excited and he still pursues it. And, uh, that's, that's on why right there and see how it's not even breaking where he rides it so it can correct. And it's, it's actually riding the energy below the surface, which, you know, for him, he's just interested in what's the most efficient way. I mean, look at that. You'd never enter in, um, regular surfing. Be able to ride that. So it enables them so much fun. You're flying, that's what they say. That's the difference. Right? So they're flying. So that's, I think, keep kept him interested.

Speaker 2:          00:31:07       But you know, his, his pursuit of this is, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's a pretty interesting relationship to watch. I think it's important. I mean, as a female for me, I think playing volleyball helped me understand like having a pursuit, you know, like something like I got to go do that. And I think it's something about living with a person who has a pursuit other than, um, like I need a bigger war chest or whatever. That's can be really cool is when, when you're riding that thing and there's the little airplane under the water, is there any risk of something thinking that airplane is a fish? Um, no. Animals are pretty smart. Yeah. I don't, I think, I mean, I know sharks don't have great vision and I think Laird is, uh, you know, hit a home, a turtle, you know, not done eating by like grazed did or something.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       But those animals are pretty smart. Well, but I was thinking the sharks now. That's what I mean. I go maybe a Marlin who thinks it's fish? Yeah, I don't think, I don't think they want to have anything to do with that thing. Just the speed and the shape. And also a lot of those animals don't want to get in that turbulent. It's still near a wave. But you know what maybe you never know. And if I hear of a story I will definitely call you. Tell him cause I'll be like a Marlin came out. But those guys are smart. All those animals, you know, lens or smart.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       Well I mean they not usually, I know sharks again don't have great site, but they're not like, Huh. I think they understand what's most times what's food. Obviously shiny things and things like that. But, but there are instances of people getting hit by sharks, right. In Hawaii is a big one, isn't it? Thing you're swim worse as far as like more and South Africa is really a lot of sharks. No, Hawaii has their fair share, but nothing crazy. I, there's a story that happened like three weeks ago on quiet and Hanalei Bay, the sky great surfer finishes his ride, jumps off his board and jumped onto a shark. Oh, Jesus Christ. And the shark like turned I guess and sort of he was a firefighter, this guy and like grazed his leg and split. And I think it's just the reminder that sharks ultimately really don't want to have anything to do with you.

Speaker 4:          00:33:34       I mean, maybe hammerheads maybe a little more aggressive. Bull Shark is the most, because I think right, they have the most amount of testosterone of any animal. They're the ones that can go to the fresh water too. Yeah. The bowls. So they're sort of more actively aggressive, but I mean, I don't think a shark, you're not good eating. I watched the television show. They took, uh, they found bull sharks way up to Illinois River. That'd be scaring whatever river it is in Illinois. I don't know what Rivard is, but they found him deepened freshwater. Yeah. These sharks make their way all the way from the ocean. And then Jamie d see anything about the testosterone. I think of any animal they have the largest amount of testosterone or something like that. They're mean little fuckers. Yeah, they are. They're responsible for that. Um, the actual news incident that influenced the creation of the movie jaws.

Speaker 4:          00:34:20       Oh really? Yeah. It happened in the river in New Jersey, in Jersey. Can imagine a river like a freshwater river. These people are getting murdered by sharps look. Yeah. Really? I didn't know that. Yeah, that's what it was based on the, they didn't know that these fuckers can swim way up into fresh water and they just got ahold of the people got Ahold of a few people because those buggers are more, a little more aggressive. Yeah. There's supposed to be the most aggressive. Right? Yeah. But I think, you know, for me with the sharks, like even jaws impacted me with that soundtrack and I was living in, in the Caribbean and it's a psych, I dunno, my kids that whenever my one daughter's like, oh, can I get this movie on sharks? I'm like, no, cause we live in Hawaii. He can't be watching that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:35:02       Yeah. Chuck Testosterone. Mythbusting oh, it is scientific American. Yeah. Oh, it's not real? No. Okay. Sound good though. It did, didn't it? Yeah. Much more likely to you. I'm a bull shark, you know? Yeah. But a tiger shark would son even meaner? [inaudible] no. Wow. Pools meaner than tires. Yeah. They say Bolin hammer or more aggressive. Then tiger layered in. My daughter reached, just went to do you know Mike Mueller at all photographers sheets. A sharks. I know who he is. Okay. He's, he does amazing stuff, but they go and they dive. So he took a Reese and layered and they

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       went for like four days and they go in the cage with the great whites out at the Galapagos and they said, it's pretty far out. You should do that sometime. Fuck that. Commodity markets, man fucks up the cage. People probably doing stupid things. No stooping. No. He'll do things like we're guys hit each other in the head, but you won't go sit in a cage. And it seems normal to me. They said that once you see him under that, you have a different feeling though. Like you're not, it's not that you're not as scared, but you, you just see them a little differently. Not just like a Predator, uh, learning as you can see the pupil there, I and everything.

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       Did you hear the Canada? They're banning whale and dolphin captivity. I think it's great. I think it's great too, but it apparently just passed. I mean, how about blackfish? One documentary and it like kind of, I think initiated a movement. Oh, for sure. Yeah. People didn't know they needed to do you just see it in a digestible form instead of having to go seek it out and read articles about it and news reports instead of that, they get to see it. There it is in a very digestible format. Go, oh my God, this is chaos. This is horrible. This is it. This is an atrocity. You're taking these incredible animals that are probably some of the most magnificent creatures that evolution has ever created and you're putting them in a fish tank. You're putting them in a swimming pool. There's their fins gold blend. Yeah. That's crazy. Well, it actually, if you think about the killer whale, I mean that's, the cane does a crazy video that I just watched yesterday of one killing a beach seal. It injured the seal and the seal tried to make it over into and it literally beached itself smash this seal on. There was just blood everywhere and these a bunch of people were standing around watching and going, Holy Shit, and then it flopped it's way back into the water and swam off

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       it. Did it eat it? Yeah. Okay, well that's what I mean. Listen, that's the thing about nature, right? It's, it's kind of brutal but it's not personal like the see the, the, you know the whales not like, you know, that seal gave me kind of a funny look. I want to go and give it to him. It's like, oh there's some food. Did you ever see them one when they're on the iceberg and they look, oh that bugger is still holding on and they push it again,

Speaker 3:          00:37:51       calves at a hunt to mark that she was setting it up, like showing like you can make them slide like watch. This will slide well. I was listening to my friend Steve [inaudible] podcast and he was talking about the difference in the orcas in the Puget sound and that their local orchestras, which are, uh, essentially, uh, salmon specialists and they don't eat animals, they don't eat marine mammals. But then there are other ones that travel into the area and they are marine mammals specialists. So they, all they eat is like seals and, and uh, and things along those lines. And they have a totally different language. Totally don't understand each other. They don't interact with each other at the,

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       every pod has its own language. It's crazy. They, they put up a whale in captivity once and it was not eating because they didn't know it was a seal eating well, not a fish eating well and so learned, I used to joke, can you imagine like, okay, Suzy and Billy, we're going to go watch the, you know, the Orca Shamu and then the trainers, they're like throwing at seal. Like that would not work out well. Like, Yay. Do that trick again. Give it a slab of cute little animal. Yeah, no, so it's a, they're very complex. Yeah. Well it's,

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       if it didn't exist, it would be way more interesting than big foot. Yeah. Right. Everybody's like so into big foot being real. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       I don't get big for it. Can you talk to me about that? Like I hear, do you think what, what is, what's the concept of big foot? I mean, I know, okay. It's a big hairy guy, but yeah. Well, I mean really come on. What is it

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       most likely there was interaction between human beings and something called the Gi Canto Pythagoras for thousands and thousands of years. It's a giant bipedal hominid that it existed in Asia that was between eight and 10 feet tall. It was real and it was basically in like the Orangutang family looks almost orangutang like, but enormous. And that was a real thing. Okay. And they didn't find out about this until like the 1920s they found a tooth in an apothecary shop and China and a, and anthropologists examine this tooth. It was like, where the fuck did you get this? And they took him to the site and they dug out more things and bones and jawbones and they determined from the job on, I'm sorry if I'm fucking any of this sub scientists, but they determined from the job on that they think it was bipedal, that it stood up on two legs and so then they said, well, how big would this thing be? And then in the proportionate,

Speaker 2:          00:40:17       yeah, like the fields. Are you ever seen one? A real one looks like? Yeah. I just, sometimes I, when they say like, oh up in Michigan, I'm like, is it really like what are they seeing?

Speaker 3:          00:40:25       Bullshit. Most of it is the people seeing shadows in the trees and they want to believe it's big foot and they're seeing bears that are walking on two legs. But if there was a thing, what's really interesting is that's where it would be because if it did come across the larynx, the Bering land bridge, like they believe humans did. If that did happen, the many animals Maton navigated from there to here. That way. That's where Alaska and the Pacific northwest, that would be the natural path. And then if you think about how densely wooded that area is, right, that would be a natural habitat for something that's hiding from people. The problem is you can only hide from shit anymore. It's just too hard. They'd see from space something would catch you on a trail camera. Some, there's trail cameras that are everywhere. They're fork like, did you see those? These a guy and his father got caught poaching a mother bear in her den. It's ill, it's horrific, it's horrible and it's not just horrible because they, they poached this mother bear in there, Dan and left the, the baby's essentially to die, but they were talking about

Speaker 4:          00:41:33       how they're not going to get caught doing it. Like no one's going to tie us to this. And the way they were caught, there was a four k camera that was right behind them that was, that was observing this, this whole area where this bear was den den. They have these trail cameras now that are incredibly accurate. There's so like, it's so high definition. Super Clear and the audio is clear. They would catch one of those fucking things. Yeah. If there was something out there, but I think there is something to be said for the tooth fairy and thinking we don't know everything like that. It's fun. The magic of stuff, unknown and behind. I mean for me it doesn't have to be big flip, but I love, I love the idea that we haven't seen everything. We don't know everything. Obviously we know that with space and who knows, you know and dimensions and time and universe.

Speaker 4:          00:42:28       But something mythical is pretty fun. Well, what's interesting is that there was a bunch of different kinds of humans. That's what's interesting. And they found these bones and Russia that, I think they call them the dentist's Whovians, they found a, but this is within the last 10 15 years, they found a completely different species of humans that lived in Russia. They found those little people on the island of Flores and that was only like 10 years ago. I mean there's, there's probably dozens more that they just haven't uncovered somewhere. So if there was at one point Tom, some big giant hominid it's totally possible. Yeah. I just don't think he would have to eat so much to be alive. 10 today. Beef constantly. It's like a bear, like you find bear shit everywhere. Where's the, where's the gorilla shit, the big foot shit or whatever it is.

Speaker 4:          00:43:16       It's an easy, is it eating plants? Is it eating animals? What the fuck is it? Eating right can eat a lot. A lot. That's in big family of a six foot something husband at home and he, it's a lot, a lot about all surfing all day that that Duke could put it down. He can put it down. Can you eat a lot? A lot. I preposterous amounts, foods and ideally big each meal or do you started got okay, dinner and today, Hey, what's your big nouns is white. How are you feeling? Yeah, it depends. Like sometimes I've giant meals for dinner, but sometimes if I worked out too hard at night I'll have a giant breakfast. If I just, I just do whatever I feel like doing, but I definitely always have intermittent fasting. It's at least six days a week. I take 16 hours off one day.

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       I don't give a fuck. It's amazing how much food we don't really need to. Yeah, it is amazing. I used to eat way too much in like way too much protein and stuff when I was playing and going through different phases of training. Um, now do you go into like autophagy and do all that tail? No. Oh, okay. No one explained that to people. Um, yeah. Well yeah, it just one sort of step, a bigger alist a deeper step when you, when you do a little bit intermittent fasting is if you don't start the digestive process. So if you just had, you can have water and caffeine,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       you can't have fats and things like that. Um, the theory is is that whatever soul, uh, you know, dysfunction you have, you kind of can rinse out kind of three times the amount, the process of when you do intermittent fasting. So it can be a really effective way when you're in a minute fasting to say, okay, I'm going to pick this four hour window for most people, probably be between like three and seven or two and six and I'm going to eat. And then the rest of the time I'm not going to, so it's, it's very close. It's just sort of one more twist they can put on it. I think it's like a t o p o, you know, so that's a 20 hour fast food window every day. Yeah. And I have a friend who was doing it pretty regularly and he used to, he looked different. Really? Yeah, please. Yeah, no he did. He shifted his body composition a little bit and um, it was interesting. And there's some interesting data. I'm sure Jamie can give you the download on it. Um, yeah, autophagy, it's just sorta like one notch higher. It's not fun. But I, you know, like for me it would have to be kind of, I would want to eat between one and five. I could do without it the rest of the time. Um, and you can have, like I said, caffeine and water.

Speaker 4:          00:45:47       It's incredible what a poll mouth pleasure has. Like my kids bought these estimates, cupcakes. They're those humans that's like old school, old school, but they are bullshit. These cupcakes, they're like those chocolate frosting on top, a little whites, Quigley. And the inside is a cream filled. God Damn was delicious. But while I was eating and I was like, what the fuck are you eating man? This is all nonsense. You shouldn't even be touching this. No.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       Well you can't do that. I think once you, cause we pretty strict Laird's have a little more strict than I am. Um, I think if you're going to eat that cupcake, you enjoy it. Yep. I think, you know, even having that small conversation with yourself as a colossal waste of time, as you shove it in your mouth and it goes down, it's like, because that's so human, right? Like, it's like, I shouldn't be doing this, but here I go, you know, why am I doing, why I shouldn't? You know, it's like, I think it's important to do it and enjoy it. But yeah, that's not food that's like,

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       I don't know what that is. The thing can live for like 800 years thing is we had eaten and I was full, but that looks so good. Like if someone had cut a piece of steak and put it in front of me, I'd be like, I'm good. I'm sorry I'm stuck. I saw that cupcake. I was like, look at that motherfucker that when kids are like, I can't eat anymore. What's for dessert? I have a separate space for that. That doesn't change because we're older. I still have a separate space. It's just, you know, try not to use it so much when they say that for people that are in like competitive eating competitions too though, you can still eat fries because fries or you don't like fries. You'd be like, I just had the vision of a guy shoving it in the water and then the Bun and the hot dog and then like, you know, squeezing it down.

Speaker 4:          00:47:28       Yeah, yeah. That you can eat fries. Cause what? It's not protein. No, it's uh, it's the saltiness and the, the, the, the carbs. You could still eat, you can always eat another car. He'll give, you ate a steak. Right. And that steak was a big 18 ounce ribeye. You ate the whole thing like, oh, but then you see those fries, like all three of those fries and deployments of Ketchup. Aw. There you could keep eating, you can eat another thousand calories when you're in that food, like a trance, you getting those food trends. Food trances. Yeah. I mean you have people, I have friends that like, you know, if you have any like thing out on the counter, that snack ish, like you have it for the kids. Right. And your friends that come to visit and say hi and they're kind of fidgety and all of a sudden they were just like eating everything and you look at him like, Bro, like you're in a constant food.

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       They like Trans Snack. It like don't have snacky, you know, anything around is can't help themselves. Oh No. CanNot for sure. No, I, but I find it easier. I don't know if you found it easier. Like I had a, I used to have a really heavy chocolate trip heavy. Like I used to have a chocolate drawer, like the whole thing, like no for real, like every kind of chocolate, like get open it. And it wasn't like a thin door. It wasn't like a silverware with drawer. It was like a deep drawer. Every kind of chocolate and I mean stress, you have bus out the chocolate, you know, whatever. Right before your time chocolate kid walks in the room, they've taken something and you're like chocolate. You know. So I'd had, I had every kind and work it does, but then I stopped eating it as much and now it's like I don't even really want it as as much.

Speaker 4:          00:49:00       It's weird. It's kind of a bummer. Really love dark chocolate with peanut butter. Oh yeah. Like some dark chocolate pudding to try it on their jiffy. Oh yeah. Some skippy and be some bullshit peanut butter. I like the crunchy stuff too. So yeah, because the healthy stuff, somehow the oil and the stuff is separate. You need that stuff that has like those unknown chemicals to make it really smooth. If you like this natural peanut butter, this isn't good. It's not smooth. Look at that natural peanut butter. You got to get that fucking butter sandwich, school lunch that you rip a hole in the bride your life to knowing. Yeah, no, forget it. It's either too dry or too oily. Yeah, it doesn't work. It's never perfect. You can't make a sandwich with it. There's just no way. You got to commit to a five minutes stir before you ever even think about putting that shit on your bread.

Speaker 4:          00:49:48       Absolutely. Hey, so you know what I was thinking, I wanted to invite you. You can bring whoever you want to come pull train with us with pool training. What do you guys do Jamie? Can you pull up like a pool training or XPT pulled training. P T was that Sam for, this is another thing that we do, but this kid, this is like a 12 year old former training. We built this pool and layered, you know it's always trying to, you know, athletes in their off season and we were like his crap. Like six of our friends. We built this huge pool and there it's like, okay, take some dumbbells and go down a, there's Kyle Kingsbury. Yeah, you're big way anywhere. Says t his little suit, the little girl to

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       do it. And uh, anyway, this is all the shallow stuff, but there's deep water. That girl didn't get going. Um, they have dumbbells in their crotches we'll get Kyle, this is when he was a little bigger. Stoia do we have the idea of how, okay, so there's deep water. Like you're 13 feet, you have w you have weights, ballistic, um, ballistic training. No. Uh, no punishment to your joints and doing cleans in the ocean or in the pool rather. Yeah, I don't, this is all shallow. There's some deep water stuff and I'm not sure why that guy is doing a little,

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       did you drop the Dumbo all the way down to the,

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       so you have drag and stuff like that. And also it's lighter in the water and heavier out. But this is not the stuff, I mean this is all good. It increases your lung capacity and things like that. But there is a deep water element where so you can be ballistic and you can do all this stuff and um, you don't pound your joints and you can get stronger. So we have a lot of athletes that come and train so that they can sort of work on some of these elements of there being more dynamic or what have you. You're in compression. It's, it's pretty cool. And we couple it. So I know you like to do heat and stuff, so we'll do like heat and ice and then pool and heat and ice and pool and things like that. It's, it's pretty great and you're tired but you're not beat up.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       George Saint Pierre actually did a lot of that in training for his last fight. He did a lot of his work.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       Here's the deeper stuff so you can like, and what's cool about this too is, um, is that you have to moderate your breath because it's very straight forward air, no air, air nowhere. And

Speaker 3:          00:52:17       just listening to this, we're looking at these guys. It's probably like a nine foot pool. They have dumbbells in their hands that drop all the way down to the bottom and then let their knees go to full, full, uh, bend and then with their butt to their heels and then jump right back up and pop out of the water, get a deep breath, and then go right back down again. So you're constantly leaping through the water to go to the surface.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Yeah, the skin ripples. So I actually think it's really attractive when you're a girl too. I just want to tell you what's crazy is that, think about this. I actually think so. You're in compression, so you've got those benefits, right. And I think your tissue, like your fashion, everything gets kind of rolled almost in every, every set with that ripple. I think so. And, and that they're more shallow and then there's more, there's deeper and things like that. But there's probably about 35 exercises that we've come up with. Laird made us all his crash test dummies. Um, but it, it will economy makes you feel like 1 million bucks, but you can Kinda, you can bust your butt on it. Right. But you don't, you're not getting in the pounding. Well that's it. I already have a fake knee. Yeah. What'd you blow it out? Uh, well it was an ongoing since my twenties and then finally at 46 I got it replaced.

Speaker 2:          00:53:32       Wow. Is the difference now? Ah, so much better. I was like, yeah, I used to like sleep with my good leg underneath my knee trying to open my knee joint because it felt like metal on like hot metal touching and then your foot gets heavy, you know, if you lose a lot of your, your function. I tried everything, you know like stem cell and PRP and like you try everything because you don't want to be like getting a fake knee. And then after I was like, I'm sure there'll be something better in 10 years, but right now let's just do it. So it was, we went in the same day. We actually, Larry got his hip done the same day and I got my knee done. How did Willard injuries hip repetitive trauma, I mean, you know, Laird is now 55 he was 52 when he got his hip. And he's, he's tough on his body. I mean, he's tough on his body. And then if you're like doing isometric loading, when the foiling that one hips taking a head, it's the back leg. It's, you know, it's a lot,

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       a lot of load. It's amazing though that he's gotten back to surfing at the same level.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       It's, he's, he's very unique. You know, he, you know, he says that everything he does, like his relationships, what he reads, what he eats, um, what he spends time doing is all to enhance him to perform. And his, you know, a ton of people like this, his ability to deal with discomfort, he has a very good relationship with discomfort. So his training and stuff, it's, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       wow. Those guys wind up injuring themselves because of the though that mental toughness.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       But he's really smart. He's not a, well, you're not his age and foolhardy. He's not like want to show it. I can do. He's a guy who can call it. He's a guy who can go, yeah, no, it's not a good idea.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       So when they do the hip, they have to put that that raw through the center of the hip and then put the new joint on the outside.

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       It's all, I mean he walked, he stayed awake. They did a local and he left the hospital at three o'clock that day. Wow. It's carpentry. They whack out the doctor huge that it's not fine surgery. It's like carpentry and he stayed awake cause the guy's like, okay, you can, you can handle it, you know, the noise or,

Speaker 1:          00:55:42       or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       He uh, same time. And then he was gone out out of the hospital. How long did it take to rehabilitate? Not Long. I mean he was, once the incision closed, he could go out in the water. What's that? 10 days?

Speaker 1:          00:56:03       Sure. Pretty cool. That's crazy that they can do that now. I had a buddy who did that, Graham Hancock. He did the six weeks later he was here and he told me after we were, he was walking around, I was saying hi to him. Was that I had my hip replaced. So I go when he was six weeks ago. What the fuck are you talking about? You're just walking. You just don't want to play golf. You walk out of the hospital. Okay. Bad thing. Well, let's say if

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       you were loading your hip that you load into, you might want to not do that right away. It sounds weird, but yeah. Yeah. Like you'd put weird torque on it. Yeah. I know a guys have gotten back to Jujitsu with bad hips. Oh yeah. Back to rolling and training again. It's, you know what they basically tell you is you don't want to do anything you wouldn't want to do with your real joint. Like the guys like Sophie ever got into a car accident. You wouldn't want your knees to go back and in towards your hip. It's like, okay, well I don't think I'd want that to happen with my natural hip. So I think they're pretty good. Is it significantly weaker? No, not at all. Not at all. No. Do basically everything. He can do everything. Wow. That's crazy. And he had a pretty wicked limp.

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       The two of us were limping around for like two years. It was really cool. People are like, Hey, you guys are those like athletes, right? That a couple of them were like hobbling around. We're like, yeah, stay right there. We'll be right there. It was just like brutal. Our kids are like, what are you going to do? Like I'm just going to run away, you know, a way I stop it right there. You know, what can you do now with your knee? Can you do all the things that used to be able to do? It would be a bummer for Jujitsu guys cause kneeling is kind of not the best. Like if he said, give me 1 million bucks cash right now, child's pose. I bet that's tough. Yeah, that's tough. What part hurts? Uh, I think for me it's also part of my bio mechanics that, uh, the tissue on my, uh, um, my quads is like probably like beef jerky from jumping all those years.

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       So that's something I'm always working on. Um, so maybe a more flexible person going in would have more mobility in that bent position. But it just, you know, you get a hard finish on it on the joint. But I think it's pretty amazing what you can do. Like it's pretty far out. Can you sidestep and stuff like that. I could play volleyball if I wanted to. You can jump and land and be hard on it. And Joey do pliers and stuff. Yeah. So they basically say just do stuff that you would do normally with your knee. Yeah, I mean, yes B be intelligent. Like you probably wouldn't want to go all I'm an ultra marathon or now. Right. Cause you might wear your joint out in like two years. But I think if you said, I really like to run but I'll go on the grass or the sand barefoot probably better stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       But that's what you want to do again anyway. You know, running s pretty tough on Ya. Yeah. And it's not just tough on your knees. It's tough on your back and stuff and everything. Are you wearing on a hard surface, seven times your body weight, right. Like each step, I mean, unless you're built, like when you see those people that are built to run, it's perfect. Yeah. So that was, that was sort of, I think that's what's interesting about being when you see people go, Oh, I'm an athlete and, and then it's like, and some days I feel, I don't, I'm sure you feel this way. It's like I feel so unathletic or so, uh, banged up or you know, like I have friends that came into training late and everything, all their joints are like all perfect and you know, they work perfectly in and sometimes I, I've, I've felt a little bit beat up. Laird been beat up a lot, but he, he kind of trains his way out of it. Big Time.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       Now when you guys are on coal, why, is there a lot of resources in terms of like places to train or physical therapists or any of that kind of stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       No, I think the other islands, like a Wahoo and Maui, they would certainly have it. I was, I actually, um, this group that owns this business there, let me use a warehouse and I taught a class three days a week for free, a dollar. Um, so they were covered under my insurance because we have so little, uh, training like we have, we have access, we have a gem and stuff, but like the community on the north didn't really, so I started, uh, doing that like three days a week to get people, there was like a hundred of us. Oh, that's the same time it was, it was really cool. Uh, but, but because they don't have stuff to, they don't have really great facilities. What a weird place to live. Is it, it's kind of bad, but don't you think? Like when I go to New York City with layered, he looks there and he looks at the buildings and he's like, why do people do this to themselves?

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       Like, we've gotten twisted around like, you're like Hawaii, what a weird place to live. But in a way, it's probably closer to how we're meant to live, you know, stacked up on top of each other. But having said that, um, yeah. Compared to the other parts of the world, I mean in its remote, like you're out there, it's, I think besides Easter island, it's like the most remote place in the world. Wow. Yeah. Really that's interesting. But it makes sense. Yeah, it's far. I mean, you know, they navigated their, and they said that the water sea level was lower so that they could see more land when the Polynesian sailed there. But it's pretty, uh, it's a pretty interesting contrast to living in Malibu, let's say. But then in a way, not because you're surrounded by nature, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       I think it's probably a far more healthy way to live. I just, I just know that a lot of people do get that island fever, they can't take it and they want to get the fuck off.

Speaker 2:          01:01:24       Yeah. And like if when you have a family, like when our kids were young, it's like you're doing the same thing. You're taking them places. You are making dinners, you're making lunches. So in a way you're just doing sort of everyday things in a really pretty place. And also you probably live a little simpler.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       It's gotta be better for you in terms of like the amount of stress that you experience and the beauty of nature's very calming and soothing and probably therapeutic and beneficial.

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       Yeah. But it's that reminder. I mean, this has been thing for me. It's like you could have all that at your access, but if you're not, if you haven't dealt with yourself or you're not, if you're feel miserable, um, it, it sort of doesn't really matter. And I think that that kind of place points it out really quick, where when you live in a busy place, you can distract yourself from yourself and you can be like, oh, there's traffic and I have stuff to do and I'm busy. I'm a busy person, I'm at an office, I della Sta. And when you're there, you can't blame

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       really the traffic. You can, you sort of have to go, oh, that's right. So it's an interesting thing of when we talk about like health or, or beautiful places and things like that, it's still always comes back to yourself and like, am I, have I made myself happy? Um, am I doing things that make me feel good? Things like that. So I think what's really great about that places that gets clear real quick. Did you guys have real internet out there? Totally like legit and I mean we had dial up til about 18 months ago for real. No, but I mean do you have high speed or nodes? Like it is America for like five genius or whatever. They've got that blanket over us there but it isn't the mind control five g net or whatever. Everybody's worried about that. I know I have a friend freaking out about it.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       Five g well we did Rudy. Something about they do have the ability to, it does have an effect on human brains, but that's what I mean. It's like pretty, pretty serious. We're going to do ourselves in one day with innovation. We're going to keep going. Absolutely. One day we've well fucked ourselves sideways. That's the way that it, it goes right? Like you get so smart that you evolve. You're like check the I when I was a kid we had a mad magazine and I'll never forget it. I was like 11 years old and there was a s a sketch of this explosion in space and it was like two aliens talking and they were looking at at this explosion, you know, millions of miles away. And they go, oh, they said smart beings lived there, you know, pretty much, I mean I think that in a way that we're, we're probably, I mean we do a lot with water and air and things like that, but it is interesting to see, I'm always fascinated that people will do stuff for money.

Speaker 4:          01:04:02       Like guys like guys running companies and they go, well, it's okay about the pollution or the byproduct and you go, yeah, but your kids or your grandkids are going to like, money's not going to protect you from if the climate goes bizarre. Yeah. But they feel like someone else can fix that. They go to get this money. He thinks that money. Yeah. I think that's just a compartmentalization. They just don't, don't think about the, also, they're a part of a corporation. Right. And everybody just does their little task. But it does trip me out. Like she'd go like, you know, we say the rain falls on everyone's house. Like it's coming for everybody, no matter how much cheese you have. Well, it's also the fact that we've had on it. It has been over this window of a hundred years long and it's a massive effect. I mean, unbelievably massive effect on the environment. It's just a short window of time. In terms of, you know, when you, I'm sure you saw Jiro dreams of Sushi. Yeah, of course. Yeah. When they're sitting around talking about the fish markets back in the day we'd get so much more tuna. Like you look one day it's fished out. This is one year alive man. So when this guys in during his lifetime and went from abundance of tuna to being almost fished out. Yep. And they're not slowing down sushis everywhere. It's like, I know what

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       we'd done in 30 years is pretty far out. It's crazy. I know. It's, I know it's an I, it's funny cause my kids, I don't know if you see this with your kids, it's like, I think they're pretty aware of it. Um, and they, uh, I think that they go flip and flop between feeling like the adults are poorly behaved and they're left of the pile of, you know, of our bad decisions. And also like my one daughter's like is, do you think it'd be okay to be like a militant environmentalist? You know, and she's like six feet tall. And I'm like, that'd be fantastic. Sea Shepherd on steroids. It's like, you know, you know, so I think, uh, it's going to be interesting to see, you know, what the next group because they're obviously really different. Like they don't want big giant houses and all that stuff that, you know, sort of my generation and your generation

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       thought that's what you think the new generation is different in their values and what they find is important, right?

Speaker 2:          01:06:18       They, they give more, they volunteer more. I think the tricky thing for them is going to be connection and being able to be connected and being able to have a real conversation and uh, you know, even be able to concentrate long enough to, to be with somebody because of devices. Yeah. I mean, I think it's far. Could you imagine right now if you were 20 no. And being like dating and swiping and trying to pay attention and

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       10, you know my daughter, one of the few girls in her closet doesn't have a cell phone. What's the age that do they get? I'm like, I've had them since they were like seven. No, I mean you're a kid. Like what's the rule in your house? There's a debate right now trying to figure it out. Well, okay, so you have a 10 year old going to be 11 yeah. I think that they say there's like a movement. Wait til eighth. Yeah. You heard that you had like 10 kids in the class. All the parents agree. So they're not the only person in the class that doesn't have it, but it's not that way with my daughter's kids. They're kids in her class. Most of them have phones. Most parents just give the kid a phone. Yeah. It's just, um, there's a, have you read any of Jonathan hates stuff?

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       The coddling of the American media of course. And that that has just so disturbing when you see the amount of, especially young girls that are growing up, depressed, cutting themselves self harm. What's that like 400% he said like from 10 to 14 or something crazy like that. Like something insane. Massive spike that directly coincides with the invention of smartphones and social media. Yeah, the slot machine. Yeah. It's this this thing where people were just trying to get likes and trying to leverage their, you know, their social status and and try to pretend that they're living in a perfect world to everybody around them and everyone else is doing it and people look at other people's lives being perfect and they reflect upon their own. They get depressed. There's just so many factors that kids didn't have to deal with just to a decade or so ago. It's really, really off.

Speaker 2:          01:08:09       Right. Like at least if I had a hard time at school I could go home and have a reprieve from it at least overnight. I think for me that's been a thing with my kids is like, cause especially daughters, I do think I understand the gaming is different for boys and porn, pornography and things like that and not whole trip of rewiring their brain. And, but I think with girls it's like how do you get them to under like get hear their own voice? I don't know how they're going to get to a place where they, I mean cause every, it's like this weird mishmosh of like me too. And then never before had people objectify themselves more because they get that positive affirmation. Like I always say, if I put out really smart ideas, um, if I'm a young woman, oh I have a thousand followers, every shot is of my, but I have 10 million followers.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       So we have this mixed message going on, which is like, I'm angry me to treat me equal simultaneously to, I'm going to objectify myself in the most hardcore way more than in any time in history. And I talked to the results and it's really blow it blow for me as a female who's, who understands both those sides a little bit. Um, I, it kind of trips me out because I don't think you like those girls, you know, playing that card and have no violence should be done to you. And I agree with all of that and no is no and all of that. But at a certain point, you know, like you've had Jordan Peterson on here many times. It's like biological signaling. It's like w w like play a side at least. And also that, oh, that's, that one side is super short lived. That's what I tried to tell my girls. I'm like, Yo, listen, if you're, you know, you're pretty girls, it's great, but if that's the card you're playing your cards done, like by the time you're 30, 35, it's done. It's over. Um, you know, unless you're like 40 and you marry a seven year old, I don't know, whatever, the MILF porn, is that such a thing? Yeah. Yeah. But even that, it's like they've got to put a filter on it. And I'm like all that stuff. I mean come on.

Speaker 2:          01:10:18       You know what I mean? It's like at a certain point, how do you get these girls to go, hey stand up for yourself. Be Strong. But like what are you doing? But look at all these people that are not doing that. They're are benefiting. I know but it's getting them to understand how do you get a 13 year old to talk about the long game? Yeah, I mean everything's immediate but for me it's like it's culturally I feel like I'm this weird mix of like the most, I came through it the most modern time. Like women went to school on scholarships and like we, we, there was no thought to being like strong. Not really. And then, but then weirdly it's like I feel so kind of old fashion when I see kind of this next thing cause I'm like well strong. For me, it was something else strong was like you were really physically strong trying to have a strong mind, you know, strong basis of a person and then okay then there was this other side like your, your sexuality, all this other stuff and now it's like, I don't know, I, it's very interesting, right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:18       Well there's certainly a bunch of different kinds of people, right? And there's going to be people that gravitate towards objectifying themselves and this kind of people that gravitate in this day and age towards, you know, you see a lot of people's pages are just fill with motivational quotes and inspirational things and you know, and then the stories about people that they meet and photos and you get a lot of people that are attracted to that kind of stuff too. It's just you're not going to get the immediate gratification of a picture of your ass that that picture of your ass gets 100,000 likes. Like wow, look at all those likes. And then, you know, it's just a different vibe and you have to decide what do you, after you have to quantity or quality or after when you are trying to accurately express how you feel and, and work it out through communicating with people and figure out how they react to what you're saying and how you feel about how other people say similar things and how it does good things for you. And you want to do good things for them. Or do you just want to have a piece of dental floss up the crack of your ass sticking it in front of the camera, this, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       No, and I, I get that. Like I get also, like I always say when you're a young woman, you sort of get this new car and you're like, well, what happens? Like what if I put my foot on the gas? Like you're sort of checking it all out. Like they respond like this if I do that, like that's completely natural. But then at a certain point, um, I don't know that the input is like, uh, you know, like, who do you want to be? And not based on what everyone thinks about you, like what actually turns you on and s and s makes you feel excited and stoked because you know it's great that you have a nice butt, but there's a lot of Nice butts and in the end that's not probably going to bring you that other feeling. The problem is that there's a thrill to positive reaction. Absolutely. And that thrills undeniable. I would like it. I'm just too old

Speaker 3:          01:13:07       people. And when people get that thrill and you tell them, hey, that thrills bad for you. You look fuck off mom.

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       No, no, I mean a bolt onto that message. How about that? Like get the thrill but simultaneously to doing the thrill. Maybe have some other thoughts about where you, where you like to continue to journey too. I think when you tell that to a 13 year old, the here and eventually I think in the beginning of the like gay, yeah, I got this. And then later when it all goes sideways, like God damn wish to listen to mom. I think you just got to be it too and have some like cool friends that hang around you because you're, if you're the parent it's like, okay, you're going to penetrate so much. But if you've got some like you know in Hawaii they call them aunties. If he got some Badass chicks around you and your daughters are looking, they see, they say, but what if you don't have access to that? I have a lot of pretty strong, cool women around me, but I could not that it concerns me. I don't want to say that. It's just how to you help the next group, you know, try to be a good example. Love on them, but get them to teach them to love on themselves. That's all.

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       And I don't mean,

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:14:14       with eyelash extensions and perfect things. I mean like love on yourself, you know? Well that's the other thing too. This is a distortion distortion of natural beauty and you know, make it so that everything has to be artificial. The color of your lips, the color of your eye, shadow, fake lashes, everything is just this, that doesn't, doesn't look better. Just looks different. Do you think I, I'm always fascinated what men think like today, even like do they, does it even register? Do they know what's going on? In what way?

Speaker 4:          01:14:52       Well, I guess we'd have to ask men of that generation if, let's say they had, uh, two groups of women and one that was like perfectly quaffed with the lip injection. And is it, I like that I'm talking about like eyelash extension is one of the Joe, but, um, like just sort of really done like ready for the club, let's just say. And then just like a girl, like, hi, I'm a, you know, I'm a sweaty runner and now I'm going to go to the office and put my hair up in a ponytail. I don't know what her, if guys, if they even, can they tell the difference? I mean, it's all what you're in, what your entails. Some guys just like, um, soft and made up some guys like I'm sweaty and muscular. Yeah, still. And I get all that. I love that. I just mean,

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       again, it's hardcore signaling and I guess that's, maybe that's what it is. Maybe it's the new biology. Well, it's also that there's never been a time like I that a bit on one of my Netflix specials were about this girl who's got just pictures of her ass. She was like 9 million followers on Instagram. I'm like, there's never been a person like this before. This is a new kind of person like fuck, fuck. Looking at these frogs in the Amazon that no one's going to say there's a new kind of person. This girl just has pictures of her butt and she's got millions of people staring at her all day long and every day is just new pictures of her, but it's a great point. I always am intrigued how they decide like, oh, we're going to do the but on the beach now let's do the button next to the puppy.

Speaker 4:          01:16:28       It's like, I'm so confused how they keep getting ideas. I can't even get ideas for different things and it's like, I know we'll do, but with the cotton candy it's like, okay, I don't know why he's got that. I think it becomes an obsession. I mean, I think you have to stay fresh with new bud ideas. Is that envelope take my editor head editor here@but.com I don't know. But if you have a girl who has, let's say some of these girls have millions and millions of followers and they're making millions of dollars are crushing it. Maybe they're actually the smartest people in the room and I haven't caught on yet. It's certainly an easy path to finances. And I know if you have a great ass and you're like working out and you just want to take pictures

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       of it and all of sudden you have 25 million followers, like damn,

Speaker 2:          01:17:13       but this goes also okay, what she do quit that job. Definitely not cause then when is she going to say, well I'll do the right thing and work at the library. I'm not saying it's just, I mean if it was my kid, I'd be like, you know, sweetie, you might want to weigh out the economics on this. Right? I think you said something really important. It's a whole new thing and I think however, it's sort of like the communication. You're always having, which is well, what is success? And for me it's, that's all. It's like getting people, encouraging them, whatever that is, whatever that looks like. You know, you said this like Oh you do the show whether anyone was listening or not most likely, right? I mean until you couldn't afford it anymore, let's just say. But obviously I would do it just to have the conversations, right.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       Maybe I wouldn't do it as much, but I would definitely do it if I, like if someone said, hey, you know, every few months a physicists will come in here and sit down with you for three hours about, yeah let's do it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       Yeah. Well you're bringing information to you and learning to you. So for you, part of your definition, that success. And so I guess that is the conversation cause we always have this thing that's obvious thing of like successes. It either his notoriety, it's power, it's money and then we forget those other communications about like the pursuit of something that really genuinely turns you on.

Speaker 3:          01:18:34       Well I think people get short sided and you definitely can get success. We just have money. And you just have objects and you have notoriety and people viewed it as success. But if you're not doing what you love, it's not pure success. It's a different kind of success. Like if you really find something that you enjoy doing and then you take that like layered has with surfing or many people have with their passions and then you become successful through that. It's a different existence because it's an, it's a pure existence. Like when I do stand up comedy or if I do see like a commentary for the UFC, it's uh, a very, it's a pure enthusiasm. It's genuine and I don't have to fake it. It's, I enjoy doing it. That's to me, I don't, I know everybody can't do that. No. Or everybody feels like they can't do that or they haven't figured out a way to do that yet. Right. But if you can, if you can, if there's a thing that you can do, like maybe I would have made more money if I went into the stock market. Maybe have made more money if I was a banker. Maybe. I don't know. Right. But I definitely wouldn't be as happy. There's no way. If I'm the same person I am now and I was in a fucking office all day, making a hundred times as much money, I'd be miserable.

Speaker 2:          01:19:45       Right. And I think that, I guess for me that's maybe when I see the thing with the girls and like I said, feeling sensitive to it because I have daughters or just young people in general. It's that conversation of like, you know, just keeping that definition of success open. And by the way, this other path that taking it, like following your own instincts or desires or passions, there's elements to that that are, our heart are harder for sure. It's more unknown. You can feel insecure. Like is this the right thing to do? I mean we've gone, I mean in our house we've gone through that 50 different times, you know, it's like I'm going to do this cause I really want to, I don't know what's going to happen. Right. And I don't know if it's going to be successful. I might even lose money. Who knows? But that once you start to do it or you do it once or twice, then you go, oh, but it's so worth trying.

Speaker 3:          01:20:36       If you can pull it off. That's the thing. Like if everything worth doing is hard to do,

Speaker 2:          01:20:41       do everything and, but by the way you might pursue, we've pursued 10 businesses and like one is soup, really thriving, two are doing well and the rest like we ate it, we ate it in cash, we ate it in time, we did. So I think that's the other thing that's important is like, Hey, uh, you know, it's like sports. How many times, you know, do you lose to you? You lose a lot. Um, in order to win. And I think, I think that's something that for me, like with my girls it's like, hey, just try to work really hard and hear your own voice and, and follow that if you can. And it is scary. I think it's scary.

Speaker 3:          01:21:24       We are also a person who's had that opinion reinforce through vigorous work over the years. I mean your, your uh, your, uh, your, uh, super successful competitive athlete, which is one of the most difficult things for a person to do, to like force your body to perform better than everybody else's. Figure a way to win, figure a way to get points scored figure way where all these other people who are also high level athletes are trying to stop you from doing it, figuring out a way to succeed and you're going to fucking fail. There's no way around it. You're going to have ups and downs, but you're gonna understand the value of pursuit of dedication and discipline and your kids are going to see that. It's like they, they must know their mom is a bad ass.

Speaker 2:          01:22:07       No, I don't know. Kind of understand who you are. Yes and no. I think it's interesting cause then you know like how sons can push against Dad's dad's identities, right? Sure. There's times, not my youngest and last, my oldest, but my middle went through a phase where it was like, she was almost like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna Knock her off her high horse, a know like my, my real estate that I, that was my real estate. And it's like, um, and you know, she's a big, strong kid and, but then she, I think she realized like, oh no, no, no, this is more about me finding my own real estate. Like my mom did that because that was what my mom had to do and what she was good at. And that was my thing. And it was, but there was a minute that I think, listen, no kid looks at their parent that they actually live with by the way, and is like, yeah, they're cool.

Speaker 2:          01:23:04       There's just no, I mean, like if I deserted them and called like four times a year, they'd be like, it's my mom. She's on the phone and she's an exotic country. They're like, Yo, get me some water. I'm going to bed. Like, you know, it's like, it's no different in any house. And by the way, I, I have this new thing I'm doing right now with my youngest daughter cause she can get me, like, she can get me like nobody's business. Like Laird always jokes, he goes, you two are not allowed to drive in the car together anymore. Like we come home from one ride from school and I'm on the mats. Right. This kid is like, cause we're very similar and she just works me. And then she work. He was just you and her alone of course. Oh No. Especially she's no dummy.

Speaker 2:          01:23:42       This kid is so smart. We always joke, I like Brody will run something. I just want her to have friends. Uh, hopefully you know that she's, she's pretty radical and she always gives you this look to while she's carving you up. That took a slight smirk on her face and I'm like, I'm gonna kill this kid. You know? And so, and then you think I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I've been around, I'm trying to be evolved and I don't think I'm having a, you know, insulin spike. Like I should be balanced and calm. I think I meditated this morning and I'm like four seconds. And I'm like, you know, the console becomes a little sport for him too. Yeah. So now, okay, so this is the best is so I go, okay. I layered was telling me this story years ago, he got, he went down a river raft down a river and went down the rapids and got pinned against the rock.

Speaker 2:          01:24:31       Okay. And it was breaking on his back and he said he was pushing on the rock and pushing, couldn't get off. Okay. And he said he had this image of like a skeleton, like on the Rock, you know, like with the water, just pounding on it, you know, it's like the clothes all messed up and he said he, he moved his foot if wiggled his foot and his whole body slipped out. And so I said, when I see my youngest daughter, I'm going to wiggle my foot because I keep pushing and prodding and cheese just coming, you know, she's a hydraulic, like it's not stopping, it's not UNCC. Like she's younger than me. She has more energy. She's faster. I mean, you know, and so I go, I'm just going to wiggle my foot, like literally to the point where even if I need the physical cue, like if she's standing there doing some of her weird bullshit, I'll just be like, move my foot just to give them a trigger.

Speaker 2:          01:25:23       Like I've got a trigger myself, I'm a parent, I'm like against the ropes like everybody else. And so, and I have a partner who supports me and sometimes he looks at me like not, not, not that strong of a game Gab. And so, so you know, we'll, we'll, we'll get into it and I, and I'll, and I'll go to pick her up. And my whole thing is when, when I, I talked to my kids in the morning, like first thing I always say, hey, good morning. Like I try really hard to be the adult and to be the parent, right? Like that's what I'm really want to do. Like, I really want to show up as the adult and I'm flawed be it. I still be like, you know what, I at least she's acting like an adult that, that woman over there, you know, get me water.

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       And so, uh, she'll get in the car and I'll be like, hi honey. How was your day at school? You know, I try even though look, the fake nice tone and everything. Yeah, I don't really, you know, listen, I spent almost seven hours there. I really don't want to talk about school. It's like a colossal waste of time. How old is she? 11. She's like, and then she says to me yesterday, I'm not exaggerating. She goes, you know, and if you listen, no one fence. I'm sorry, my mother trying to be rude. I just, I, if you can't tell, I don't like to talk that much. It seems like a waste of time talking as always to us. What she says, she's very self contained and I'm thinking through that, but okay. So then I'm like, all right, well another strategy. So I go, oh, that's cool.

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       I can be self contained. Like, I'm cool, I don't need to beg. Oh Sweetie, I don't care. No problem. I just click over a little bit into my mail like, okay, if I can drive this car and maybe I'm going to drive a little faster and like let's go and within three minutes somehow all the things I said I wasn't going to get lured into nothing. I'm going to wiggle my foot, all of this like philosophical stuff. I've been reading books, she gets me and she's like 95 pounds and she gets me. She's my only kid that gets me like this and it's literally like if you went into a restaurant and you said, okay, I'm not going to order it. A little design yet and the hamburger and the double fries with the chili sauce and you walk in and you go, I'll take a little design.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       You have the hamburger and the, it's like the one thing I said I wasn't going to do and she gets me every time. So that's something I'm always really trying to figure out. And also like a survey back away from I, this lady, actually, you should have her on your show. Have you ever heard of Byron Katie? No. You got to get her, Jamie, you got to get her. She's, she taught me a lot of stuff, but it's basically like full and men do this better generally and yes, there are women that do it as well as men. I'm not getting into all that, but it's like surrendering like maybe my kids gonna grow up and they're going to be completely different than what I thought or what they would be or my expectations. Um, and that's actually probably closer to the real, the real thing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:14       So I can be that, you know, going through sports, I was like, man, volleyball is way easier than this. It is. It's just very, it's cause it's straight forward. Take the ball, hit the line, take the ball and hit the other line. Oh, okay. No, that was, did you complete that? No, I didn't hit the line. Okay. You hit the line. Is your 11 year old involved in sports? Oh yeah, the worst sport ever. What's four horses? It's like beauty pageants on big animals were parents don't think it's cute to take six year olds and think, oh it's so sweet. We'll get them, we'll go ride horses. Cause then they fall in love with horses and then they want better horses and then they want and pretty horse pants and then the boots and his the deep it'll kill you. She, I have to say to her, I'm sorry you not born to billionaires.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       I'm really so sorry for you. It's pretty heavy. My middle daughter is into tennis and she's pursuing tennis and I'm trying to figure out how to manipulate my young one out of away from horses. And she'll say to me, I know you think it's a phase and it's not going to make it a not phase. And she's, and that's why I'm like no, do whatever you want but you have to use your own body at least a couple of days a week. I go, cause you're using the body of the horse. And by the way, doesn't it frustrate you? I even tried this. I can't believe I'm admitting this.

Speaker 2:          01:29:32       I mean I thought you guys loved the animals. You know, like you really loved horses and what you're doing to them is not good for the horses. They land on the same foot and she's like, they jumped in nature. I go, they don't, not with a hundred pounds on their back. They don't, and not, they don't land on the same leg. I've tried that. I can't do that anymore. That's not fair. And then, um, I oh I totally, and then the other thing I've tried is, um, doesn't irritate you if you are on a horse and you were more talented as an athlete or you had trained harder but your horse was in as good so you couldn't win. And she just looks at me like I'm going to ride this out. She doesn't care. It's nothing impacts her. Cause that's what frustrates me. Imagine if it was like I had a better guy than you so I could kick your ass.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       And you know, Jujitsu cause Mikey was more expensive. You'd be like, wait a second, I trained twice as hard as you. I've been doing it longer and maybe I'm just better than you. Nope. Mikey's more expensive. So if you have a shitty horse, there's nothing you can do about it. And the judges know, they know. They know. So yeah, I would never get into that. And I don't come from that. I barely come from like if I didn't hit a white ball, I wasn't going even going to the university, nevermind. Like you know, this whole horse world thing. God, I found myself, I went to a show once and I was like saying good morning to all the groomsmen. Like good morning sir. Good afternoon and like giving stink guide all the ladies, you know, I was like, yeah, this is an upside down here.

Speaker 2:          01:31:06       Different thing. Yeah. I just, I I really, this is one of my, I lose sleep over this show. Really? Yeah, I do. I do. [inaudible] [inaudible] it's a lot of money and that's not the part, I mean I lose sleep over that too cause I'm like, Larry's going to kill me. But, um, because then the flip side of it is I got a kid who's into something. She'll go to the barn if she, if you let her seven, eight hours, she'll work with the horses, lunge him, do all this stuff. So then you're like, okay, well she's into something. This is not a kid who will sit around and not do anything. But I just, I guess for me it's the, you know, it's, it's the, it's the money sport, you know, take that weird bubble thing, you know, so that, that part was like, I was like, Oh God, how did we get here?

Speaker 2:          01:31:53       Yeah. Yeah. That's what my friend is dealing with, with his daughter. How old is his daughter? She's 10. Oh, is he in deep already did, is he Lisa Horace? Yeah. Got a horse. They ha they bought a horse. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know you could lose the horse brokers. There's a whole thing of size. It's a shyster Mary hold trip. It's super expensive to Lisa horse too, right? I think it's like 40 grand a month or something crazy. That's like, well then you've got a really fancy horse, but it's expensive and made that number up. Yeah, you did. And then that's like bill gates daughter's home. But then it's like, I dunno, for me that's it. But again, as a parent I have, these are one more of my lessons. Like I'm not her and she's not me. And I have, uh, I, as much as I used to think I was so in charge of so many things.

Speaker 6:          01:32:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:45       You know, I think being in a long relationship, I've been with Laird almost 24 years. It's like you start to learn like, oh, okay, I'm, I'm not, I can impact you. I can influence you. I can support you. I can love you. Um, I could try to inspire you, but, uh, not here to, it's like even as a parent, like I am not here to control anyone. And that's a hard thing. Cause when you get a little baby, you control, you're in charge. That's what you needed to be. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah, no. And that shift is they don't, I wish people need to talk more about like the shift of, cause we're not objective and, uh, you know, the tools that you need. You got to keep adding tools and it's,

Speaker 2:          01:33:31       it's very humbling. Do you find it easier to do on [inaudible] or at, in California? Cause any different? Well it depends, right? So if I have a, my middle daughter who's a teenager not on Kohai, she looks 18 or 19 and uh, you know, there's not a lot to do. And uh, so that's tricky. They're here. Like she, she basically lives at a tennis house and she goes, she's homeschooled and she does five to seven hours of tennis. Her choice as of in the last couple of months. So it's easier cause there's just more productive things to do. Um, what I like is when they're little [inaudible] great because it's so simple. Life is simple. So what kids are thinking about is like playing and being in nature and like developing also a toughness to them that maybe like city kids have it different cause like they're barefoot and they're like climbing trees and they're throwing rocks at each other and it's just like a little more rough and tumble.

Speaker 2:          01:34:31       So when they're little [inaudible] he certainly easier. And then as they get older, that's what we're, where we're sort of at now. It's like you got to adapt and put these kids, give them a launching pad, if you will, because a, the problem is like, and I went through growing up in an island, it's like you don't know all that's out there to dream to do and it's, even if it's, you know, everything in life, it's so true about like being like the alchemists. Like I even see it with layered, it's like he went out into the world, he's done all this stuff and there are certain things we're doing in projects right back on Nicole [inaudible] and, and so there's always going to be that element probably of um, I went and I did all these things. I express myself all these ways. And then there's some basic parts about where I exactly started that are still really important to me. But I think it's important for kids to see, like it doesn't matter where you're from or how you grew up. Like certainly Laird and I both the same way. It's like you, you really could try to do anything and, and pursued that if it's in you, if it's genuinely in you and calling you. And I want that for my kids and I don't care what that is. Um, but just that they have something that they get up each day and they're like, Yo, I'm turned on.

Speaker 1:          01:35:42       Yeah. That really is what people need to really need. Something they love doing.

Speaker 2:          01:35:46       That's it. And I think that's when I was talking about success is sometimes we have all this, you know, kind of bells and whistles and attention around getting attention. And I think people don't realize that getting attention. I mean, you know this for yourself. It's like, yeah, it's great, but what is it like what does it really? And when you close the doors and you're hanging with your people that are, you're close to, it's like, you know what's making you excited for real and who loves you for real? And that way of like, it's great if people appreciate your work. That always feels good. But if you're doing it for your real reasons, then I already think that is a real success. Um, and we spent a lot of time working, so why not have something that we're fired up on? And that's the thing because it's like, you know, you spent a long time of your life working. What do you want to do?

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       Yeah. That and then guiding a child into that direction of trying to set them up in a way that they view their life as kind of a project and the most enjoyment you're going to get as find a thing that excites you to find the thing that you really get inspired by some the whatever the fuck it is, it's going to be different for you than it is for me. They've got to find out what that thing is, but it's all the same thing. Once you find out what the thing is and that that thing genuinely gels with your personality and your likes and your passion, just run with it. You can do it. Yeah, you can run with it and it

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       changes too. I think that's the other thing is also we get defined like, okay, you were doing this one job and then it's like, okay, but that job is over. Like it's like being an athlete or an, you know, a Pr, you know, competing competitive athlete on an organized platform that has it a day and a time. And then when that's over, do you want to look back and keep talking about that or do you want to look and see who you are now and who you'd like to be? And I think that that's always a, you know, kind of an important thing to teach people, especially people that have, well I'm, I'm a comedian, I was a professional athlete. It's like, okay, that's cool. I had some guy coming to me once and say, Hey, I'm, I was at the golf course and I was, one of my kids were hitting golf balls and he goes, where are you?

Speaker 2:          01:37:59       That volleyball player Gabby? And I was like, oh well no, I'm, I'm still Gabby. But one of the things I've done is play volleyball. And I think that that actually, if we can get to that, that's even better. It's like who am I? And then off of this non, you know, as far as like whether you're older or younger or in one part of your career or not, it's like you still can always be the essence of yourself. And then it's like, oh, and now, right now I'm doing this and that. And I was, you know, but I'm not, I'm not for all time. Just, you know, a volleyball player fighters have a huge problem with that. They identify as being fighters so much that once they retire, they almost, almost all of them, except for a small percentage, almost all of them come back because they just, they miss it so much.

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       They miss the excitement and the thrill and they don't know who they are. Without that pursuit, the pursuit is the next fight. The F pursued his training camp getting ready. And when they don't have that for a long time, it just starts really chipping away at them. Well, and I think too, the amount of focus it takes to be really good at that kind of stuff or to run a company or anything. It makes sense why it's so hard to try to diversify while you're doing that. It is really hard. But I think it's important to quietly keep that voice inside your head going, yeah, but who are you, um, beyond that expression of yourself? Who are you, what do you, how do you feel about things? Um, and also the opportunity like to kind of grow up, you know, there's so many opportunities, like 30, 40, 50 like to try to try to, and I don't mean grow up in the notion of like you're so responsible now.

Speaker 2:          01:39:44       I mean like grow up in a way that like maybe you, you change your ideas and the way you do things. And you know, I was talking, I was telling Larry, I was in this situation this week where I, something had gone down. I didn't like the way it had gone down. It wasn't to do with him. And I was like, you know what, I'm, I'm not going to attach to this. Like I, I know better. So now I'm just going to notice that it kind of bugs me and I'm not going to attach all the way to that feeling and to that experience. And I, and for me that's more what I mean about growing up, not like being, you know, grown up. Because I actually think that the more grown up we are also means we could probably be more childlike too for sure. Both. So it isn't about like be responsible, it's just a different freedom. So I mean I, I would think in the end that that would be a more interesting quest then I was a champion. Anything, I don't know, and it's not sexy and it's internal, but I dunno, it's can be I think pretty rich. But I think ultimately for a person who's experienced athletic highs, uh, the highs of

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       accomplishments but also understands real personal struggle, that's when like a person like you, you've experienced so many different things, you can you and understand what's actually beneficial towards you. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:41:04       And it's pretty simple. I hate to, that's kind of the heavy part. It's like, it's like being married to Laird Laird is once it got to bed at eight 30 and Laird wants to get up early and he keeps it pretty simple. And I, it's an interesting thing because within it there's, um,

Speaker 6:          01:41:23       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:41:23       he seems pretty good. I mean, as long as there's sometimes waves because that guy is like, that seems like a, that's pretty straight forward. Well that's it, right? Like how do I, how do I get the highest ideas, the biggest ideas, you know, whether it's like I'm dealing with ego or whatever, get the biggest ideas and then get everything else pretty stripped down. Pretty simple. Yeah. Because otherwise it just, I feel like you're running around and I'm, I like, I love the days I'm running around and I'm like, what am I reacting to? Like what the fuck? Like what do, what is going on? Like I'm like a crazy person. Right. And then it's like, okay, you know, you got to back it up and it, and listen with kids, it's hard because you're only as good as like your, whatever your kids are going through. I mean, and then there's elements of it, like they're going through things and you go, it's probably pretty natural. Yep. Even if it's super hard, it's like, and that's okay too. And you don't want that for them. But I think, you know, that's something I've really learned is like I had to, God, it's a bummer that you have to go through that and it's hard to watch and I don't want you to, and that's okay too because that's part of,

Speaker 3:          01:42:35       it's really cool though to see them come out in the other end and then talk to you about it. Oh, it's not bothering me so much more. Um, yeah, I get it. Yeah, I was just upset, but I'm all right.

Speaker 2:          01:42:45       You know, and it was really cool. Uh, Dang I learned, cause I, I am, you know, listen, I'm pretty

Speaker 2:          01:42:53       Siri, not Siri. I'd say I'm a pretty serious person. Like Laird is sort of the lighter person of the two of us. And I, someone sort of gave me some information about like not resisting with my kids. Like my oldest was going through something and I said, I just need to tell you how I feel about this, but I didn't make it a big deal. I just sort of dropped it off and said, hey, this I'm feeling. And she said to me very clearly when she was like 22, uh, I, this just feels like something I have to do. And I remember thinking, I felt like that and nobody understood what I was doing. And I understood I had to, something I had to do for my reasons and I was right for myself. And what I did is I just went, okay, I get it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:35       And where I wanted her to end up happen so much quicker because I didn't put up the resistance. And that's the other thing. I mean, how long does it take me to learn that one? It's like, you know, not having to try to resist or navigate every single situation in disco. Okay. And then you get through it so much faster and they get through it. No, no, you're Lord Subaru in nutrition layered has is you guys have this company [inaudible] Laird superfood. Yeah. De Force has stuff when your kids, are you kidding? My kids, if they want to eat pasta and whatever, they can eat whenever they want. Yeah, because I cooked dinner so we know what dinner looks like. My kids, I always say just now, what's the difference between food and fun? Be Clear. Bagel is a lot of fun. It's not food because I just want to send them into the world equipped with the information on how they can take care of themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:44:30       Because if you make anything a thing, don't have that. When they go to their friend's house, they'll have a bag of chips, the clicker, and there'll be like, I love it here. So, um, I am like, yeah, whatever you want. And my kids eat pretty healthy. That's awesome that they listened that way. They don't listen well that they've figured it out, that they eat healthy. Smart. We'll also, okay, so my middle for a minute, like never met a carve. She didn't like right. And it was like, it was bad for a minute. She was like 12, 13, whatever. And then, uh, she, and she knows the difference and she was also using food to sack, you know, kind of assuage some feelings and other stuff too. That's interesting thing. But then she's come around, but it's not, let's not pretend that my kids listen. They don't, their costs a little, no they don't.

Speaker 2:          01:45:23       No, they don't. Your example, that's more they're watching but they don't listen. You think in a way Laird, I could be sort of maybe imposing parents in some way and I'm telling you they are not. They don't, it doesn't, they? They look at us like, what do you got? It's like, come on, it's your move. So I've just learned like it's your choice. Like this is what I'm serving for dinner. I don't have pop in the house obviously, but if like we want someplace, you know, I showed him a picture when they were little. I remember the guy who did like eat this, not that Dave, uh, with the Z for men's health, the editor. Anyway, it was like seven or eight chocolate chip cookies and a sun kissed soda opposite each other. And I'm like, do you want to cookies or do you want that soda?

Speaker 2:          01:46:11       And they got it. It's like, oh okay. Cause it showed how much sugar was in both. So it's just that kind of stuff. But they don't, it's not like we live so healthy and they listen. You know, I mean, Ben Greenfield, right? He lives in like the forest and they, that's different. It's a different level of control. I don't have that kind of control. Yeah. Ben's got a weird thing going on out there. His kids listen, they must, they're out in the forest. You have to, that's what I mean. I'm saying I don't have that level of containment that, uh, that he has to do with predators, like living predators. You really let your kids just go loose and your backyard. No, I know. Keep an eye on them. It's easier than Coca Cola and cheeto zone a different kind of way. I'm just saying like predators, very straight forward. Like it's a predator. Don't go out there. It's like, well, you know, this food, it's in a bag. It's got, you know, it's not that good for you. Your cell functions like, okay, what am my friends do it? It's like, you know, Predator. So I just think, I don't know. I just think, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:47:16       I think I've surrendered to the idea of them listening and I've just tried to show them the best example and they are intelligent people that I have faith and will arrive at their own conclusion. And by the way,

Speaker 2:          01:47:31       you know, they make, make other choices. I don't think so though. How many kids leave Kohai like when they grow up? Not many, I don't think. I think it's, it's tough because it is so beautiful and magical and on some level intuitively it makes so much sense there. You know what I mean? Like it makes a lot of sense, right? Like the foods growing, there's certain things that you, and you go into the real world and you're like, Whoa, do they have good supermarkets there? Yeah. Just everything. Costs of a box of cereal is like $9. Whoa. No, for real. So it's hard, but some kids leave. I would think that that would be a difficult transition between going from quiet, like moving to Chicago or something like that. It can be, especially if it's like December, but I think you'd be surprised. Yeah. Let me tell you, the cold is shocking when you come from an island.

Speaker 2:          01:48:21       Like Larry goes snowboarding, I'm like Alaska and stuff like that cause he loves all that. Right. But I grew up in Saint Thomas and I'm just like, you know, five days in the cold I'm like, this is so beautiful. And then I'm like, I'm good. You know. But I think you know, listen island people, they either like Jones for the big city or the number one tourist destination for Hawaiians. Do you know what it is? What Vegas? Cause it's not really well cause it's opposite, right? It's like, it's like uh, everything's artificial age and then you have a lot of like Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiians, so like fine gambling, things like that. Oh yeah. It's a number one like Hawaiian Airlines. That's their number one destination for locals. They go to Vegas. Wow. I mean cause it's the antithesis, right? Yeah. I guess you see the Strip and all the neon, the craziness.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       Totally giant flashing. Yes. And that a drop of water or not anything natural. Like you're not really supposed to be there. You know, like there's no garden of Eden. That makes sense. Oh totally. So either either they adapt, they go like, Hey, I want to be a designer and live in New York. Or um, you know, that's gotta be the ultimate one 80 culture shock. They have that though. For sure. Yeah, for sure. They have that. I think I, I'm with Laird though about living there. Whenever I go there I'm like, what in the fuck is this? I love it. I love New York for like a week. Well you can get stuff done in New York and to a real New Yorker.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       There's no other place like New York. Right? Like I can get whatever food I want. Exactly how I want it. There's that and I can get stuff done. And you're also breathing in dust all day. Yeah, it's tough. And I don't think we're supposed to be living on stacked on top of each other. That's the thing. And there's always like, yeah, something goes wrong. This is the worst place you ever want to be. Like garbage, water, toilets. He's like, cause he's always thinking about like if they turn the power off, what's going to happen? Yeah. So that's how he kind of how he lives. I mean we had a uh, a hundred year rain and [inaudible] April five feet in a day. Yeah. It was pretty radical. So, and then, then we went through the fires. So it's just like I think fires and it rains that month. Well know in map then we were here in Malibu and so we had that like within six months after.

Speaker 4:          01:50:36       So I think he's always, and I think, you know, listen, when people do things in nature, like rock climbers are big wave surfers or whatever, they're more in tune with the fact that like stuff does go wrong. And so they're not assuming that it's always going to be as it always is. So big storms out there where, and quiet like hurricanes, they haven't had really a significant one since in Niki, which I believe was in [inaudible] 92 which was really bad. I think it was the lar, the fastest wind speed to hit land ever far. Where you guys as the crow flies from like the big island. He's got [inaudible], he's got a thing for the big island. What's happened to you on the Big Island? I love it there. Did you have like an experience or no. Do you go on a spiritual journey or anything? I like it there because it's, uh, it's, it's, it's like a good medium.

Speaker 4:          01:51:25       Like, Yup. I get it. Not quite as populated as Maui. It's not as metropolitan. No, but it's still pretty big. Whereas Lanai is probably my favorite. Really interesting. It's so quiet and yeah, I hunt for like a day. Oh, there we go. And it makes sense. It's also a overpopulated, so it's like the most, it's like the best ethical argument for hunting. Yeah. Currently available in the United States of America, if you want to call Hawaii the United States of America. I know if you ask a Hawaiian like, oh, you're American. They're like, you know Hawaiian? Yeah, they're Hawaiian. I'm quiet is the most north. So it's the other end of the chain. So how far away would it be? So if you were going to fly in an airplane, it's an hour, 45 or 45 minutes because of takeoff and landing. If it was like straight, like we whip, we go on a plane, it's probably 28 minutes. So how many miles is that? Cause you're going 500 miles an hour. It's a couple hundred miles. Yeah, it is. Wow. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. No, I mean it's an amazing new island forming right now, but yeah, I like your fascination with Hawaii or love it out there. I really do. Yeah, it's great. Steven [inaudible] tried to talk me into moving them out. [inaudible] he loves it out there. Really loves it. Loves. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       he gets out.

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       Yeah. I mean he flies around, does this Aerosmith shows and does that television show and all that jazz, but he loves Maui.

Speaker 2:          01:52:53       Yeah. You don't love it too much. I do love Maui. I guess I lived there also when it was like a little less populated, so it's like anything when you watch it, you just to kind of go, whoa. But it's a, it's a great blend for me. It has still nothing compared to this. Like I was just a, I mean it's like this is, that's all right. Well we're here is crazy. Ellis, what do we have? Like 35 million people here? Something preposterous. It didn't even know really. They're just guessed what he like the ninth largest economy in the world. Yeah. I told her when we had this whole thing with all the, the Mexican, you know the Mexican, you know, whatever non illegal whatever. I said, I have a friend of mine who, he's from here but he's from Mexico and I said, you should band together.

Speaker 2:          01:53:36       You have the ninth largest economy in the world and get together and have demands because you're helping run the ninth largest economy in the world. Well, that's what's hilarious about people that want the immigrants to go back to Mexico, listens to bid. This thing would fall apart. He told them when you talked to go mobilize, let's go, and he was like, what's crazy about it? It's like they're already a part of the system. Like why don't they get the benefits? I said, I think that he was laughing because when I went to see him, I go, how's it going? He goes, well, hopefully I'm here tomorrow, joking, you know, and I go, you guys have like you're making it happen.

Speaker 1:          01:54:10       Get people to organize like that. They're so worried about being shipped out now. Ice, you know, I had a friend of mine who was a veteran and he's an older gentleman, he's in his fifties he got up, pulled over at ice. Oh, come on at the home depot. They asked him where he's born and he say, hey asshole, you're not supposed to ask questions like that, like you don't have a warrant to do. And he started grilling the guys and he pulled out his military id. He's like, what the fuck are you guys doing here? What do you think you're doing? Yeah, yeah, I'm American. I was born in America. He goes, I'm an American citizen. I'm also a veteran. And then he started, he goes like, you guys, this is illegal. And that's supposed to talk to people

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       this. But they could do that to people that don't know and are scared. Right? I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:54:50       yeah, but you, if you're just an American citizen at fucking Home Depot, you're not supposed to get harassed by some guy who thinks you might be Mexican because you're brown and brown skin. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. But it's just also like, is this really where our problems are? What about these using these resources in a positive way because a lot of shit that needs to get done,

Speaker 2:          01:55:10       but that's ever, I mean, that's everywhere. Thinking about how much time gets spent on not doing anything and going the other direction. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:55:19       Well the, isn't that less of a problem though when you have a small community, like why that's gotta be looking at a huge alleviation of frustration. This is just the giant masses of people and the stupid jobs everywhere. It's like you got guys kind of kind of boiled down to a much more natural state

Speaker 2:          01:55:36       one, it's all very accountable, right? Like if I say something too, I don't get to walk away from that. Right. On a fucking little island, I'm going to see a 50 more times that day. And so I got to own it if I, you know, and that, that was all Laird's biggest adjustment is because everything he does and says he is owns it. And so he, when he first came here and like if even driving, if someone flicked him off, like you just don't do that in Hawaii, could you, I know your truck. Like I know you, I know your sister. Like I'm coming to your house, you know, like what are you talking about? Right. And I've been with him where he has pulled people over and said, listen, like you, you can't go and just like drop off aggressive gestures. Uh, you just don't know who, like, what's up with people.

Speaker 2:          01:56:21       Like you've got to be accountable like this, like, you know, and I'm like, okay, well you cannot stop every vehicle and jump out and be like, hey, you know, but no, he's done it here. No, you don't have to do it there cause there and here it's dangerous. Yeah, I guess 10 B it can be, it's true. It can be, and he's, but again, he's, he's older and wiser. I'm talking about like maybe when we first were together in his early thirties crazy Laird, but he still has a look at his eye where it's like, I don't know. Yeah, I get it. Like, well, if you're really used to that environment to where everybody is accountable and then you see these just assholes. Yeah. Well that's it. And also if you really said, okay, let's go outside, they'd be like, I'm going to get a lawyer.

Speaker 2:          01:57:05       I think for him, that's the weird twisty part. It's like in Hawaii, if they say it, it's like, okay, let's go. At least it's like, okay, I'm going to stand up to own the words I say, and everything here it's like if you go okay, and they go, no, you know, I'm going to call somebody. It's like, he's like, okay, well, which is it? You know? Like I always tell my kid that was my one daughter does that. She'll be like, really aggressive and then you, if you call her on it, she gets like, she's the victim. I go, no, no, you have to pick like which one are you? Are you like aggressive or are you the victim? But I don't know. I, I think it's interesting, he, he will call people out every time though. If they are acting weird, he'll just say like, what's up?

Speaker 2:          01:57:42       Or How's your day? 10? And I'm like, oh people are not accustomed to, because in Hawaii they were just very respectful that way. And welding, there's accountability. And I think there's also a lot of fighters come out of Hawaii. Well cause it's a fighting, it's a warrior culture. So you know like uncle slapped boys' heads and like, and it's also now because of the Brazilian influence coming in, now you've got, you know, Jujitsu and, and also I think about this, they're pretty strong, right? And, and so contact, they don't mind little contact, like they even joke about like Polynesian rugby players. Like it's like, oh fun. Like Oh, you know, like we're leveling each other. So you're also talking about people who maybe they don't mind a little little contact, you know, like playful because they are also playful. So it's also like this weird thing of like, I'm not, I don't take myself so serious. So there's like a playfulness but also like, oh, we're gonna do you notice a big difference between like female athletes and male athletes? Like, okay. Cause fighting is a pretty, I don't want to say exaggerated, but it's an interesting thing where, you know, you have men and women kind of differently, but doing the same thing, if you will. Yeah. Um, do you notice a difference in their mentality? Um,

Speaker 1:          01:59:05       well they vary so much individually. That's what's interesting. It's like you'll find even male fighters are like super laid back and then you find other ones that are really intense and super emotional and uh, it's really hard to tell. Like there's a, there's Gunnar Nelson is a guy from Iceland, you know, is, I know who he is. Yeah. Fantastic. Jujitsu guy. You cannot get that guy to change as expression. It doesn't change. You could punch him, kick him in the balls. He stay stoic. It's a weird, he's a weird guy. Yeah. He's very on one side of it. And then there's like, I like Conor Mcgregor who's also his training partner who's on a completely different side of it. He's screaming and yelling and talking shit to everybody and you know, that's, that's part of his flair. Right. You know, they vary so widely and it's, that's true with girls too. Some girls are brash and outrageous and they get another girl's faces and put their knuckles on their nose and when they're at the stare down and other girls bow on the hug and they take selfies together, it's like everyone has their own sort of approach to it. Yeah. It's very interesting.

Speaker 2:          02:00:02       It is interesting. I'm always, I'm, I'm in fighting and intrigues me and that I think it's interesting that you're trying to be offensive and defensive at the same time dealing with fear, like all these things happening simultaneously. And I then take it, I look at it one step further with a female because,

Speaker 6:          02:00:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          02:00:23       I don't know. I, I, I'm interested to know how if, if a female can fight from a non non anonymous [inaudible] place but without her emotion, like just like okay I'm in my mail, I'm in my athlete and um, I'm not going to be like, oh she didn't just kick me in the ear, you know, and like freak out. You know what I mean? Like cause I think about myself and I'd be like, you know, like I've only been in one fight my whole life and, and the girl hit me in the face and when I saw my blood I was like, oh no, she did not just hit me in the face, you know, and then went crazy. But if these girls could be like, cause they're so well trained as an athlete, how that can supersede or override actually like this in the feminine impulse of like a, you know, reaction, a reaction.

Speaker 1:          02:01:14       Masculine impulse to though I think it's a human impulse. If a guy punches you in the face, you get furious. It's so hard for people to not get emotional when they get hit because you want to get it back. That's a good point. It's a very bad way to react in a fight to fight with emotions because you expose yourself, right? You leave yourself open for counters, you just, you, you miss your rhythm. You not as deceptive and your, your emotions, you're too and your pattern

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       and so many times you, you get hit a lot more and it's a, it's a big problem with fighters. That emotion, that's a very big problem. And the wanting to break people, like letting them hit you so that you could show them that they, they can hurt you. I think it's a masculine thing to stupid. It's a very stupid, take it on the face on purpose and then just like, come on, come on, come on, hit me. Yeah. Then that's a terrible emotion though cause you can get completely knocked unconscious doing that happens all the time. It's just the smart thing to do is to fight with correct technique and with a correct strategy, meaning you have an understanding of how to execute best. It's not to just wait in and let bombs fly. It's, you have to, you have to be very precise in your tactics. You've got to be very smart.

Speaker 2:          02:02:28       I think it's interesting though, um, those sports where there is that, I mean, listen, versions of it is football. You know, living with layered, obviously, you know, he always says he appreciates mother nature because it's like you make good decisions. You're rewarded, you make bad decisions, you, you pay a price. But I think it is very interesting when you have two humans strategically trying to deconstruct one another. Um, the chest, the physical chest that goes on as like looking at it from another athlete's point of view. Um, I think it's a unique person that wants to put themselves in that situation. You know, it's like, I understand almost like, uh, you know, a surfer and a wave and a rock climber and a mountain. I get that. Like I'm going to be a part of that. Um, but I find it really interesting and even sort of, I'm even more curious about women, like who say like, yeah, this is going to be my sport

Speaker 4:          02:03:28       wildly. Uh, like there's Holly Holm. She just seems like awfully sweet. She seemed like she'd bring you cupcakes or murder. You kick your fuck. I saw that. I mean, listen, I saw that kick, but then it's like, I'm so sorry I made you these after, you know, chocolate chip cookies. It's like, okay, I'll get it. You know, when I come back from the hospital, I don't know. It's, it is interesting when you see girls like that. Well, they're all different. I always want to know, did they have brothers, like where they rabble rousing and that their whole time and it wasn't, and they learned to play in, it wasn't personal, you know, and like a little contact was okay. Maybe. I mean, I'm Ronda Rousey his case. It was also, it was very much right. Her mom was a world judo champion. Her mom was a pieced. She's had an interesting path, I think.

Speaker 3:          02:04:14       Right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm wonder how much she loves the WWE. I wonder, I always wonder when a person is like an elite athlete at the highest level one, a real one. If they, they still enjoy doing that because I think she enjoyed it though. I think she was a fan of it. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:04:29       for sure. Yeah. I think she actually enjoyed pro wrestling, you know, and she doing athletic things even though it's obviously flying off of an into and around. I mean it's athletic, but it's scripted. Yes, it's not competition. But then again, you could only get knocked unconscious so many times. You can only get fucked up so many times and she got fucked up. Two fights in a row really bad. The Holly Holm Kao Ruthless. That was brutal. And then Amanda Nunez just punched her face and for 48 seconds it was horrific. That was hard to watch. I like to watch, I mean, I don't like to watch a really big guys punch each other and women, I don't know why. Like when guys are a little smaller, it's easier to watch as long as they're not kicking themselves in the head. I'm just saying. So the big scary ones like heavyweights dropping bombs on, yeah, you just go, oh my God, that just that guy I took eight years off that guys, you know, it was definitely different.

Speaker 4:          02:05:29       Notice it like a, there's certain heavyweights and they hit guys and they get knocked unconscious, whether it's Frances and gone who or steep Vimeo church or these big guys and they slammed, someone's like, oh my God. That's what I mean. Like I watch that. I don't actually, I mean violence. I know it's sport. For me it's, oh, it's violent. It is. Yeah. It is a very dangerous path that you have to know when to get off and more, I dunno if I would say more so than other combat sports, but yeah, it makes sense. All of them, all of them have a path. But I think very specifically MMA has, you have to be really careful because the consequences are so great. There's not enough padding and those gloves are tiny little things. You could also get kicked. He could get kneed in the face, elbowed in the face and once you've realized the Chin starts going and your reflex is start going and you're, you're slowing down.

Speaker 4:          02:06:22       Like you got to get out and out, got to get out. And sometimes they don't get the proper advice and sometimes they don't know what else to do. They don't have anywhere else to go. And that goes back to, yeah, I was talking, I talked to Larry about that cause we have tons of friends in organized sports stuff. Like you have to be drafted or coach, the team has to pick you up or you know, whatever. And I say to him like how fortunate are you that you're in a sport like other athletes, like a snowboarder or whatever that you can go, you can go out. Yeah. You want to ride, you can go right. Nobody's dictating to you. And if you're really smart and you're managing yourself and your health and your wellbeing and your melon and everything else, you could write a really long time. Yeah. That's a big difference between that and a competitive fighter. 55 years of age, you aren't doing shit getting hit over and over. No chance. I mean you could still train in certain aspects, especially Jujitsu. Lot of people deepen their sixties seventies, 80s train. Uh, you can definitely do that. But there's a such a such a difference, you know, layered can go out there and do what he wants to do at the same level he was able to do two decades ago. It's, it's exhausting actually to live with. I swear to God

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       cause I feel like Laird is like I in this way of like when you live with somebody that's sort of, you know, it's like, I mean you, you have a partner, it's like in ways there a reference to you in certain ways. And so I, if I like living with him and you're referencing him as an athlete, you're just like, oh man, I gotta get, I gotta get busy. I got to get training, I got to get moving. You know, it's just like, cause he's, he's nonstop, that guy cause he has to, that's a different type. You know, I, a lot of times I'll train cause I'm like, Hey, I know how good I feel when I'm done and it's important and I have other stuff I need to do but I'm going to get it in. And for a guy like that, it's just like what it would be like if I took an 80 pound dumbbell and saw at the bottom of the pool for a minute and then tried to do 15 you know, it's just like he also has a creative approach.

Speaker 2:          02:08:26       I'm more linear and it's like for time and for this and he's like, let's just go until we can't anymore. It's like, okay, when's that drill going to end? You know what I mean? Do you train with them? Only in the pool. I'm telling you, you got to come with a friend and someone that you feel safe with. And I'm going to be honest with you. We have fighters and trainers have the hardest time in the pool. Really? Yes. And I'll tell you why. A lot of them are built, they have a lot of mass. Okay. Like it. So number one right there. Just the mass, like you're more dense, you go to the bottom. Okay. Um, the other side of it is they're used to doing everything quickly and the water's like, awesome that you want to do it quick, this is how we're going to do it. Right. And so it's a pretty cool environment. Um, but we've had a lot of, we've had fighters and trainers and they're built for, but once obviously once they get the hang of it, but I think it's, um, it's pretty special to the training because you, when you're done, again, it goes back to I am like a noodle, you're exhausted and your joints are not just hammered. So this is called [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:09:37       It's like, it's part of the whole thing that you could follow. Yeah. I mean the pool training though, it's like you have to kind of do it with somebody, someone else to show you. Yeah. I mean we started, originally it was like we were weight vests and Laird's like, just go try it as long as you can. And it's like, okay, I think I'm good now. Like I, I cannot swim anymore, you know, I can't tread anymore. And then w it was actually one of my daughters, she might've been like six or seven at the time, maybe younger and she would swim to the surface with a dumbbell and learns like, Oh, what if we made you had reps and you do sequencing where you're on an exhale or on an inhale or whatever. He'll go from like, uh, you know, I versa climber or a bike and have your heart rate way up and then go, okay, now you're going to do the set.

Speaker 2:          02:10:22       So it's like there's all these ways to adapt and it's pretty cool I think for people who train. That's the whole thing is how do you keep modifying and like, do you get locked in like on your training or do you keep going, okay, I've heard you talk about like, Oh, I've added Yoga and all these things. Like that's the other thing is like you get pretty good at something, but now how do you keep kind of adding, doing things that you're sort of unsure, you're uncomfortable, you're not good at. I think that that's always been easier for layered than me. I've always sort of going like, well no, I'm good over here. Like I do this good. It's like, okay, change it up, you know? So I think that's been a, I think that's a thing. So that's, that has everything that has, we do a lot of breathing, heat and ice cause his other thing is like active recovery.

Speaker 2:          02:11:02       People go, oh I'm, I'm half a day off. It's like, okay, so what are you going to do to actively recover? Not just take the day off. So I think he's, you know, been really into that. But so active recovery, meaning you do some breathing or something mellow so that you can participate in helping the body actually recover, not just sit around. How much of would benefit is that? And like doing something physical as opposed to just sitting around doing nothing? I think it's, I think it makes a huge difference because I don't think it's about, I have to tax my, my adrenals are my nervous system or any of that. I think it's okay. I'm going to take a very, uh, you know, uh, a Yin Yoga class. So the poses are along, it won't be like necessarily a high flow class or I'm going to do multiple series of heat and ice.

Speaker 2:          02:11:51       Like some days he'll go and just do three rounds in the sauna and three rounds of the ice or I'm going to do 35 or 45 minutes of breathing, you know, recovery, breathing, things like that to really oxygenate the tissue and the cells and things like that. So I think it's just kind of looking at what a day off looks like and making that something that you participate in, in, in supporting the recovery, not just I laid around now having said that, there are days where after you're done with that, yeah, great. Lay around like go to sleep early, eat extra more calories, whatever you need to do. But I think active recovery, even riding a bike, you know, flushing the system, the tissue, things like that. I think, uh, people think, uh, you know, off means like nothing. And I think doing something or for a certain athletes like maybe get a massage that day, that might be the best thing, you know.

Speaker 2:          02:12:42       So I think for him it's filling it out. Do you guys use any electronics look in terms of apps or heart rate monitors or anything along those lines? Not too, too much. I used to use a fitbit, um, layered uses a ox oximeter, x oximeter oximeter to like if he does a breathing to see if he can get as him self up to altitude. So he'll use that to measure and things like that. But I think once you do something, I'm really, really long time. You sort of go on my n the edge or Rni. Um, he'll use electronics more for speed and distance. He'll put it on his boards and be like, okay, we went x miles and the peak speed was whatever, 50 miles an hour. So he'll use it more for that to, to measure distance on how many miles he wrote day, um, on the water, but not necessarily micromanaging, uh, electronically. All the metrics. Now, having said that, if you were an athlete where you know, little seconds here and there made a difference, maybe you would write, um, or you know, checking your heart rate and things like that, but not, not too often.

Speaker 1:          02:13:53       No. Yeah, I would think that like things like heart rate variability, finding out if you're recovering correctly. Yeah. Not your, your heart rate. It varies in the morning, right. Day to day. But yeah, that makes a big difference between if you're, if you're doing something like Michael Phelps

Speaker 2:          02:14:09       that was, trying to think so, or track athletes where it's all these milliseconds I think for layer it's like I feel good today and I'm going to go, well, there's a lot more natural. It's more natural thing, isn't it? Like those days like you go, wow, I am, I'm tired today and I'll just kind of do the best I can. Yeah. But I think I understand wanting to measure things and also sort of saying, I feel tired because there's an interesting thing of feeling tired physically, but you're actually emotionally tired because if you look at your metrics on your physical, you have a lot more to give. And so it's Kinda then checking in and saying, well, what's going on for me? I'm usually more tired personally than I am physically, you know, like especially with your 11 year old giving you shit. [inaudible] man, she's awesome.

Speaker 2:          02:14:54       She's so, but that's what I'm saying, like I can be wiped out. Right, right, right. I could train for an hour and I could hang out with birdie 13 minutes in the car and she's the victor, like, you know, her foot's on my hip and she's standing, you know, in the post. Um, and that has been my lesson. That's one of my many lessons. Ongoing lessons is like, you can't, you cannot go at everything head on. And, uh, I've learned that certainly being in a marriage, uh, I, I developed a little bit of finesse and, uh, and as a parent just kind of going like, I'm here to love you. I'm here to support you and I'm also going to recognize that, um, you know, you're probably not going to always do it hardly ever actually the way I, I think you should or I want you to.

Speaker 1:          02:15:39       So what made you guys start, um, putting together the coffee and the super foods supplements and all that? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:15:46       by accident. Really. Um, what happened is, is layered used to, he's been in as far as long as I've known him. He's had coffee come from all around. He's of coffee freak. And then what happened is Paul Chek, I don't know, 16 years ago, gave him d in His coffee and the two of those animals would be like down in the coffee. Well getting all jacked up on caffeine and I'd be standing in the gym waiting for them being like, oh my God, like hanging out with these too, you know, for the next two hours ramped up on, on a fat and coffee, which is basically the Dave Asprey concept of like Yak butter tea and you know, fat and things like that. So the bulletproof concept. So Larry used to start to mess around with elements to add to the caffeine for the performance. And then we had a guy that we work with, I think for about three years he'd, we'd have guys come over and they'd be like, Hey, can you make me one of those coffees?

Speaker 2:          02:16:40       And after a while they'd start sending me emails like, well, how much coconut and how much of this and how much that did he put in. And our friend Paul was like, do you mind if I try to put it together in a formula? And I was like, yeah, whatever. And it wasn't with the intention of having a business. And then before you know it, it came out. And, uh, so then we have like original creamer with unsweetened, there's Tumeric, there's hydrate products. Um, you know, it's all based on things that layered really eats and uses and, uh, you know, mushroom blends that I actually put, that's how I do my coffee in the mornings. I put that in and, and do that. So, you know, that's another good example of like if you're doing something because you really believe in it and really, um, and that business has, um, we're really fortunate.

Speaker 2:          02:17:25       It's, we have a factory in sisters, Oregon, and they built another one and, wow. Yeah, no, it's, we have no, like they do everything that no co-packing partners. We do it. And, uh, now we're looking into farming ingredients and doing a drying factory so we can do that and put that into the product and things like that. So, I don't know, I think it started from a genuine passion and, and, and came into that. And you know, I always say too, like I started, I was playing volleyball at a t, you know, in college at 17. And then I started working and was sort of doing other jobs by 18 or 19, but layered his path has been really different. And really he didn't get in surfing. People like these new, maybe new Hillard was, he was sort of always on the outside, but then it's, it's really, he was like 35 years old when someone from the outside went, oh, that's Kinda cool.

Speaker 2:          02:18:17       So 35 would be considered old, I think for an athlete. And I think it's somebody who thought, I have something inside me telling me to go forward. And I think that I feel that same way. Like people have said to me like, well, why did you do this or that? I go, cause I could feel it inside. It's like, you know that from what you do because you've done a lot of different things and um, and just kind of not only trying to develop that, but try to trust it and say, even though I've, I've, you know, it, I don't see it all clearly right now. I feel it and I'm gonna just keep following that feeling. And it doesn't always lead to some grand destination, but maybe that, those lessons and that place leads you to the next, which could be, you know, the place that you know, brings you other things.

Speaker 2:          02:19:07       So yeah, these businesses are just a natural byproduct of our lifestyle, but it's pretty great. It's pretty awesome. It's stuff. I didn't start drinking coffee till I was 45 really? Yeah. Cause I Laird would be like, cause I think he was like, try this one and try that and try this. I like to caffeine. I just wasn't into coffee. How would you take it? Like you're Rahmati teams and stuff. I get all jacked up on that side, that stuff. You ever drink that stuff? It's good stuff. You better go straight to whatever you're doing. Because I have a year Mamata and I'm like, tell me kids, you get your stuff. We are in the car, you have your bags. And they're just like, dude, did you have a year? Bramante you know, like you're a crazy person. So, and now I've switched to the caffeine with the fats.

Speaker 2:          02:19:47       Um, but I, I like it and I liked the business aspect of it quite frankly. Like for me. That's interesting too, you know. Well thank you. I'll send you more on podcasts. Do you do podcast? I had a podcast with Neil Strauss and just stopped doing it. Yeah. Neil's a busy guy. And, uh, we had a podcast, we did it in the sauna. We called the truth barrel. That's what it was called. We were literally in the sauna in our bathing suits because our group, when we get together, we were, we would sit in the sauna and you know this, if you have friends over, you go, hey, you know what, I'm having love problems. Okay, we got eight minutes because 200 degrees, like let's get into it. You're half naked, so you're sort of, there you are. And so I got an invitation to do a podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:20:30       And so I saw Neil and I are so very, very different, like really different. And uh, I thought it'd be more interesting to have us with our points of view. Um, and cause then you also realize that as different as we are is we're really looking for the same things. We're trying to figure out love. We're trying to be parents, we're trying to work, take care of ourselves, age, whatever, all this stuff you're navigating. And so we did that for like a year and a half. It was a lot of fun. And people like in there in their bathing suit, sweating at my house in the sauna in the truth barrel because that's what we always called it. You can't lie in the sauna like 10 minutes long. Now we would, we would open the door. Oh but it was like an, I tried to turn it way down cause Laird has our sauna two to 2120 go in there cook.

Speaker 2:          02:21:14       No it's exactly right. But if you coupled with the ice, you're sort of grateful for the two 20 so I would turn it, I tried to turn it down to like one 20 and inevitably the next day when it was our real life Sonim alerts like who's been messing with the dial in my sauna? You know, it's like this whole thing and I'm like, well, we were shooting, we can't sit in there for an hour. You see people, they're like, can I go out? And they jump in the pool and then come back in. It was really fun. I liked it because there's something like you just get right to it. Right? Well why don't you just do it on your own? You know what Joe, I listened to your podcast a lot and I think to myself, very few people can do what you do. I think it's really important to not only like recognize when someone does something really well cause everyone thinks I could do that.

Speaker 2:          02:22:00       It's like, well, no, you can't actually. Um, and so for me, I'm very curious about people and you know, I used to do a lot of TV where I'd interview athletes. Like that was more interesting to me than being interviewed because, um, that's how you've learned. Like you go, okay, how do you do it? I know how I do it. I don't need to know that I need to know what you're doing. And, um, I just think it's, it does interest me, but I, I would want to do it right. Um, and not just assume like you can do it because to do it really well, it's a special talent. Uh, I just had a lot of practice. We'd go back and listen to the early ones. They sucked. Just you just get better at it. Yeah. No and I get that too. But I think it's just knowing, I think this is important in all things in life because we like something not, not maybe for me, because I do really like this is just because we like something doesn't mean we have to do that too.

Speaker 2:          02:22:53       Like I think it's still like drilling down on, you know, what do you want to do? Like, cause when I hear you, you go from a comedian to like a scientist, a physicist to, you know, it's like, it shows your genuine passions in all these areas. And that's what's interesting. I mean I always want to talk about like how do you get it done? I'm so interested in how people, if they can arrive at any place where there's a sense of like joy moving in and out of their life and self care. And because I think when people talk about health and fitness or wellness, I think they're off the mark about what it really is. I think for me, what I've learned is like I train in eat well just so I have a fighting chance to support any kind of happiness. Um, and it isn't just about like I'm ripped, you know, not me, but like the notion of what people are putting out there that fitnesses.

Speaker 2:          02:23:49       It's like that's all great, but if you still haven't figured out some of these other things as a person, it's like, I don't know. It seems like you're wrestling the wrong things. So I'm always really interested in and also in not only how they get it done, but also not making it seem like it's so easy. You know? It's like when people, I always joke, like when people do interviews and they go, how are your children? Oh my God, they're amazing. And I'm like, my kids are amazing too. And they, you know, crush our balls on daily basis and isn't that everybody's house, you know, or people who say to me, I mean, do you alert ever fight? Um, I mean we have and we haven't always had perfect, you know, like there's been times where it was like maybe we're not going to stay together.

Speaker 2:          02:24:38       And I guess for me that would be really interesting is to communicate in a way that's like, it's not gratuitous but at least like, hey, you're being kind of honest about like what it is, you know? And, and, and now like I'm almost 50, it's like even aging, like having a, having a realistic but good conversation about like, hey, how's that going? You know, not like I feel great. I do feel great. I do, I feel great. I'm sure you do. But there are days where you, you go, oh time, a real human time's moving. I said sometimes I say that teleric cause you know, you don't want to be that wife. Do I look all too? It's like he doesn't notice. You know what I mean? I say, I said today, it was funny, I had a thing like I realized like time's moving and he goes [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:25:27       because he knows what that means and I'm sparing him that

Speaker 2:          02:25:30       conversation cause that's like a girlfriend conversation. That's like not one that you have with your partner. I think it's important to like, you know, go down the hole with them on other things. I do observe that sometimes I look outside and I go, yeah this is not a conversation you want to have with Laird. Save that for you know, your, your girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          02:25:49       You have so much to say. I think it's like a natural progression for you to do another podcast for di to do your own. I don't know, so much bouncing around like I'm so boring. Not Boring. No. I swear to God I've, I feel like, you know, it's probably cause you think about yourself so much, you're probably annoyed that you thinking about yourself. Try to fix this and change that and adapt here and evolve their, you know, if you're really paying attention,

Speaker 2:          02:26:16       even a decent athlete is, is like I was just trying to, I was just trying to get it and I know as a human we can never get it right and that's a moving target. But I feel like the pursuit of trying to be one's best self in the is is probably worth spending some time on. Um,

Speaker 1:          02:26:38       you, you appreciate your existence more I think when you are on that path.

Speaker 2:          02:26:43       I think so. And I think, I think especially when you've had the opportunity also to do a lot of really cool stuff and must think it becomes a responsibility because you're not fighting certain fights, like certain battles. You don't even have, like I don't have to, I have three jobs, but I chose three jobs. It's not like you're just trying to survive like those people. It's like, Hey, I get it. But I felt like if you go like, Hey, I got to do that and this and this. It's like, yeah, cool. What are you doing? Like what, what else are you going to do? You know, I think that that becomes a worthy task. And I, and also like I'm trying to stay in my, I'm trying to stay married, I'm trying to be a decent mom, things like that. And so that takes probably some work.

Speaker 2:          02:27:31       Well it does, but I really think that there's value in expressing that and that you do. Yes I do. Yeah. I'm sure a lot of people are agreeing right now like, yeah, do a podcast. You know what it is. This is what I, my ultimate hope would be is that somehow, and this is I think why I love your show because I hear it over and over and you don't say it per se of saying it, but it's there always in an underlying way. It's like power and love always like be your most Badass self all the time that you can have fun, kick ass and maybe behind like for me those are the ultimate because every, all the people that I see lower, I'm like, oh, they could kick your ass and love you. You know, I that's really powerful.

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       I mean, I respond to that because it, you know, it feels important right now. I think you're absolutely right. I think this is a good way to end this. Okay. Let's do it. [inaudible] so thank you. Thanks for being here. I really appreciate it. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. Um, tell people your Instagram, your social media and Gabby Reece, if they want to check out the pool training XPT and just get people to take care of themselves. Mahalo. Bye everybody.
