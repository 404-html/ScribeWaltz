Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Live music and then you know, edited, but no, we don't even fight. Makes it feel alive and dirty. It is dirty dude. It's dirty as fuck. Bam. Just music. Maybe. What is this called? There was a slight pause. What's the. What's The music called? Portal from the portal. Soundtrack. Still alive. We tried to play this the other day, but I don't think I'm high enough.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       Expansion. You know, you want another head of this straight homie. Gone deeper. How do you like that? I'm going for, for you. Just keep

Speaker 3:          00:01:05       offering free. Started getting into good subjects. It's like save it, save it, save it, save it. That's the problem. When you get cool people to come out before the podcast, then when you try and recycle the exact same conversation so it doesn't have the exact date.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       Okay. So earlier you were talking about hide your kids. Hide your wife. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm that guy. What happened to him? Crazy. Ladies and gentlemen, joining us in the podcast is the one and only the real cliffy be Yay. Bazinsky. Is that? Am I saying it right? Fresh off the plane. Fresh off the plane. If you don't know cliff, he be a behind us is gears of war is playing on the big screen in Casa de Brionne and that is one of the masterpieces from cliff ebb and a cliff. He is a game designer for epic games and that's been my friend for a long time. We'd been friends for how long now? It's like 10 years now. Ten years bitches. Thanks. Joe. Has a habit of basically going around to a harsh light touch it. Is this the one you find in a beer can that's the most used and horribly sweaty fleshlight you've ever, ever had.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Puddles of yourself. This is the flashlight. This is a sponsor of our podcast. Before we go any further, that's fleshlight in a camp. If you go to. Yeah, and apparently this one, that's not the most effective one. If you're just looking for something to have sex with, you might as well go with the standard version. The can. One is more of a novelty item. It is a fee. You can get it done if you need to. Look at is dripping with water. You're disgusting human being. You are wretched. Brian went through a dry spell, he broke up his girls like, you know, it's got excuses. Oh Dude, come on man, stop it. You're fucking freaking me out. If you go to Joe Rogan, did you go to Joe Rogan Net net? Don't blame it on me, man. That's not cool. Soda. Cool. You wipe it on your pillow. Your dog's going. Oh man, we got problems. Anyway. Uh, if you go to Joe Rogan.net, the answer in a click the link for the flashlight. You have 15 percent off to enter

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       in the code word Rogan sort him. I asked you every week, and I always forget. Anyway, that's what that out of the way. Cliff was nce lead game designer for gears of war and so many other fucking cool games. Unreal a design director. Now design director. Is that a different thing? I mean it's basically like if you can prove yourself working on multiple projects, then you get to try and like sprinkle a little bit of the magic fairy dust and all the other projects we've got coming. I don't know if you saw that one you have. What is it? Well, it's called bullets storm now what does that kind of like a here's you remember a firefly and serenity. Those TV shows just weeding did kind of like that guy. I sort like remember seeing the ads. I don't think I ever like a drunk and space pirate who winds up crash landing on a planet.

Speaker 4:          00:03:40       And you wind up using like a combination of crazy guns and your boot to kind of fight your way off the planet. Oh yeah. It's actually really fucking cool. It's coming out in February. Wow. That sounds pretty good to go buy a bunch of crazy Polish guys. And uh, I've been working on that a bunch gotta get gotTa we got her iphone games robbing this Thursday. Oh, what is it? It's called Infinity Blade. It's like punch out with swords. Wow. Iphone. And uh, will you be able to play against people? Not yet. First release is a, just a one player, but I mean, the beauty of apple right now is you have these updates, right? Everyone. The PC days, he used to be patches and you're like, shit, I gotta get patched. The substance is broken now. It's updates and you're like, wow, I'm getting it updated to gift.

Speaker 4:          00:04:18       It's like it's thing that people don't appreciate if you came up in the old windows days. It's seamless. Always works, man. I started out with windows 95 and I'm sure you probably started way before that. I was showing her age dude. Yeah, windows 95 was the first pc that I ever had and I remember one time I somehow or another I did something somehow or another I installed my operating system onto one of those big drives where those big stupid drives remember those things? No, it was like, oh, and there's zip, zip drive. Slow ones was a big one. Like it was probably like one megabyte or something stupid, but it wasn't that big stone tablet. Yeah, it was giant. This big fucking brick shit or another. That became my startup drive. I installed windows and then it took like four days for your computer to boot up.

Speaker 4:          00:05:07       Wouldn't boot up. It was just chaos and so I had to bring it into a guy who was a pc expert who figured out what the fuck I would retardation. That guy later went into the geek squad and he's a billionaire now. Meanwhile, technology's built money, right? Like anytime you have something like six months later there's a new version that comes out. You're like, damn, I got to upgrade this. They say that, but I don't see it that way. I think it's exciting. I don't think of like people folks because you know, you know, fucking the new shoots coming out and they build it that way. No, they're just trying to catch up with the ideas. I think technology is moving at such a fucking insane. I got guys at work, they have kids right now. My, my buddy Lee, he's one of our designers. He pulled his daughter aside and he's like, look, things have gotten pretty cool in my lifetime. You have absolutely no idea the things you're in for like where the world is going like the world in 10, 15 years, it's going to be completely unrecognizable. I agree. It's

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       like from where we were as kids, like you can't even imagine, right? Like with nanotechnology and everything. It's unbelievable. You and I, I'm sorry, you and I've had this conversation a couple of times and one of the things that you turned me onto his fucking three d printers. Yeah. The idea that you're going to be able to have certain elements inside of a machine and you're going to be able to print objects we've talked about on the podcast before, that you're not going to have to go to stores to buy things no more than you have to go to stores to get a picture. You can download a picture. I already hate going to the store now dude. Like you know, you go to big box retail, it takes like 45 minutes to find what you want. Like okay, so now I use Amazon, but if I can actually have a fabricator at my house, they can print out a pen like fine, right?

Speaker 5:          00:06:33       Because they have the, you have the, like the wooden type ones right now that kind of printed out of kind of like a, like shaved material. Right? And you can just send him a three d studio object and then they have metal ones were just building metal object just layer by layer. And then eventually it's going to be the way to manipulate whatever atoms, molecules to build whatever you want out of it. It's unbelievable. And that's coming online man. And smart dust we were talking about. Right. That was another thing that you sent me hip to. It was um, the. Well explain the whole thing for people who don't know what smart does at a very high level, because again, I'm a bit of a luddite despite what I do for living a, it's a, this kind of dust that they're able to sprinkle out in the battlefield that each one has a little bit of a transmitter on it and they can detect if anybody walks on it, like any sort of footstep patterns on it because it essentially creates a little network that then sends back to base.

Speaker 5:          00:07:13       And then what happens is it can also kind of catching peoples' shoes and a little bit to their clothing. You know, there's just like little DNA bits you would find with pieces of hair and a crime scene and they can track whoever actually has that autumn right. Combined where technology's going with the connectivity we have in the world and it's. It's really scary, right. We talked about the end of privacy as we know it, right? How big are these things now? They're tiny. The size of a small grain of sand Motha fucker and I don't know how many are actually out there yet. Right? Like how much sand you get in your shoes when you go to the beach. I got a lot to you. Imagine. Could you imagine if all that sand.

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       You probably already have this right? By the time we know about it, I've always said about by the time we hear about it, that's been in use for years when they talk about clones in my. By the time they tell you they've cloned the person, the guy telling you is probably a clone. Yeah. I wonder how many technology role

Speaker 5:          00:07:55       totally used by the government that if your average person knew about it, result.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       It's in the body spray. I've gotten whole body sprays only for douchebags. That's why they want to track douchebag activity thing when they step outside of chimps, when they do like medical studies on chimps, test out Mascara on them and shit, and that's what the old spice guy there in the bathroom there. By the way, I'm an old spice guy or whatever's cheapest. Yeah, whatever gets the job done and it has to be white. I'm not. I need white deodorant. The blue kind. It's like, do you work? Do you do the antiperspirant? Yeah, I do. I don't think that's a good thing for your body. Don't worry. I don't. I know I stink sometimes, but I don't mind. You know what? What's important to me? It was important to me that they don't clog my pores up when they're trying to leak out sweat. What is that about? Your just gumming up your pores like sweat doesn't come out plugging them. You're using some sort of fucking nasty chemical that Jack's your whole, your whole system. How many people get armpit cancer? If

Speaker 6:          00:08:56       I got armpit cancer, I'd be like, thank God I had the first at something. I'm not, I'm not scared of my sweat doesn't bother me. I'm sweaty all the time. You do, right. That's the problem with once you start working at a body cam. So Harry, because my chest is Harry too, so with all funks in there and it gets, you know, skid, get some sort of bacterial, had day with your shirt off. Not that bad, but it's a lot of times too because all the way it starts itching and it gets caught in Jujitsu. People pull your chest hair so you don't wear deodorant, but you shave your chest. Oh, sexy as fuck. You're. You're just doing what? I want to shave my chest, man. I look at myself in the mirror. I'm like ready for the French Riviera Joe. I don't shave my legs though.

Speaker 6:          00:09:36       I have no excuse to shave my legs. I know some dudes who do because it gets you out of submissions. Easier. Jujitsu guys, while. Yeah. You're still hardcore into that. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. What do you think this was at kraft mega? The crap out of that is really fighting techniques. I think if you wanted to just learn it for self defense, it's a good system because what they do is they incorporate a lot of the best techniques and ground fighting and they incorporate a lot of the best techniques to stand up for someone just looking to defend themselves. It gives you a pretty comprehensive view of mixed of martial arts in general. Look it up on Youtube, man. It's like half the videos or like how to get out of a gun situation and half of them are like legit guys through real fast.

Speaker 6:          00:10:10       The other half of white up dead. Yeah, that's true. But you know what? At least you have a chance. You know? It's like if you have an idea of what to do and someone was trying to get get you with a gun, most likely they're going to fucking shoot you. Right. But at least you have some sort of an idea. If an opportunity presents a take, take, take, take control of it or not. Right? I mean like that's what the whole idea of martial arts is about. It's not that you're going to be able to beat people up or you're gonna be able to fight. It's like at least you're gonna know what's happening. It was like the scariest thing about any sort of an altercation is when you don't know how to defend yourself. You don't know what to do. And I've seen guys, I saw this guy got knocked the fuck out once and it was crazy.

Speaker 6:          00:10:45       You're talking about like at a bar. It was a bar and they got into a fight and as they got into a fight, one guy was just that. He just went into a full panic and was just swinging his hands. He wasn't even making girls. Yes, yes. Full Papo swing his hands and a car got in front of me and as the car gun free because people were trying to get out of this parking lot while this fight was going on and as the car got in front of me, as the car passed, he was out cold on the ground. Yeah, flattened out first, but it was a look in his eyes have complete total panic. He had no idea what to do. He was locked into this situation. It was on sunset.

Speaker 7:          00:11:23       You understand? I mean, you doing what you do with mma and everything and being involved in the, in the scene. Like when I went to the, I went to my first mma fight, we saw the one in Charlotte, right. Sit there and watching UFC and I'm like, you know, I've seen it on at bars and I'm like okay, this is cool. And seeing it in person, getting a huge amount of respect for the fighters and how tremendous athletes these guys are. Right? But whatever, uh, you know, living in Raleigh and seeing bar fights which breakout in a regular basis, they're not as bad as Boston by the way. We need to talk about Boston dude.

Speaker 6:          00:11:47       That's the land of savages. Twelve 30 hits and it's the witching hour is too many ugly. Angry women do their pissed to cf summit. But we'll get there. We'll get there. But like whenever I see a fight for life, dude, if it, unless it's two guys who were scrappers Mandy see like one guy picks a fight with the sky, just nobody's doing. I think it's really ugly shit man. When you see somebody actually legitimately get hit and beaten up like that before the staff and get to them, that's pretty fucked up. When someone knows how to fight in the other person doesn't. I try to make friends with the biggest motherfuckers and tenants could hide behind people. Notice, notice when the shit's about to hit the fan and know where the door is all important. You can smell it, man. Yeah. And they think about someone who does train in martial arts.

Speaker 6:          00:12:25       Most of the time you don't want to fight because it's not the same thing anymore. A good bouncer. You know how to diffuse the situation, right? You're not looking at cracks. Skulls. It's not just that. It's like you kinda. It's not attractive. You know, for some guys the idea of beating someone's asked is like attractive. But when you do martial arts all the time, it's not attractive at all. It doesn't seem like a thing to do. It seems like, you know, what you want to do is avoid all that. This is a stupid. This can get. You can get hurt, like you don't have any need to prove yourself physically were a lot of people do and unfortunately sometimes they just trying to bluff, you know, and they get called out on it. They don't know what to do. They're already at step nine. They don't know how that got there because they're in Toronto.

Speaker 6:          00:12:57       Right. And then you know, and then they say, well I to hear this guy and they go to take a swing in the horror upon horrors is when you throw a punch at a guy and he moves, he actually knows how to fight and he's sober. Then you're fucked because then you're drunk and you did a Douche bag thing and some guys going to let you up. Next thing you know, you're on the side of the street bleeding. They're bleeding. Or from my experience, I mean there's always going to be assholes that do martial arts, like just assholes to do everything, but it's much, much smaller. Number, so the odds of someone who wants to fight actually being a martial artist, most of the time they're not. It's a big misconception like these guys that are filing George Saint Pierre who's like one of the nicest guy you're ever going to meet and even Josh Koscheck, the guy who's fighting him this weekend, fucking great guy.

Speaker 6:          00:13:37       If you're not fighting him. I mean he likes to talk a lot of shit and likes to like get inside guys heads, but a lot of that's pre-fight high. But outside of that he's a very nice. A lot of those guys beat the shit out of each other and then they just the end, they're just kinda like, what's. Because it's a mutually kind of assumed destruction, right? They're like, okay, I'm going into this. That's my profession, right? It's that. And some guys get real caught up in the shit talking and some guys, some guys, they drop it as soon as the fight's over and you know, you see them, they'll go out and have beers and shit. It's like, you know, look, there's a certain amount of stress involved in this person's your target. You're going to be some animosity, you know, but for the most part they'd like resolve it way better than boxers do know.

Speaker 6:          00:14:10       Boxers seem to be on, I don't know what it is, but there's like more douchebags in the boxing community. I'm not exactly sure what that was like five, eight years ago and it was considered that nice thing and that that's always the way with any sort of any sport, right? Looking snowboarding. And that was all the skiers looked down on, like that's a joke. That's never going to be big a doubt. Snowboarding's Frickin huge. Right? That happens with so many different sports. Right. When I was first involved in mma, it was almost like telling people that I was involved in porn, like, yeah, because I was working on Newsradio. Right. And uh, and by the way, I'm not the only one who said this. Dana White said the exact same thing. He said the exact, the exact same feeling. You feel like you're doing something sleazy.

Speaker 6:          00:14:47       I say video games, dude. No, no. Okay. Dude. When I was like, okay, this is my story. I was on news radio and I started doing the backstage university UFC and this was 1997, so this is like we were in Augusta, Georgia and dove in Alabama and places like that and I would tell them that I was off to go do commentary for cage fighter and they would look at me like, what the fuck is wrong with you? This is terrible for your career. You want, you want people to know that you're, you're commentating on cage fighting. You know? It's like, it was almost like I was doing girls gone wild or something.

Speaker 7:          00:15:16       The video game analogy though, I mean it's not a one to one, but at the same time it was one of the situations like, you know, 10, 15 years ago was like, you want to do that? And it's like, oh, that's cute. You know, my, my little son plays that in the basement. Right? And now it's one of those things. You look at everything from the three 60 that we to Natal and Oh, I see what you're saying, but it doesn't have a negative connotation. Does it not ever used to. Now it's the coolest fucking drop and it was, it used to, it was more of a frivolous connotation, not a negative, it wasn't negative, it was more of a pat submissive. Okay. You run along little billy with your little video games thing because he used to play pong. Right?

Speaker 6:          00:15:45       Right. But now there's games like call of duty that make more money, way more than Avatar and that like, that needs to sink into people's.

Speaker 7:          00:15:50       Had they go to the difference of $6 day one versus, you know, 10 bucks, right. Immediately takes, you know, not as many people to do it. Right. I mean they are getting so good at building up the hype for these midnight launches for all of this. Right? Like, I mean, the biggest issue right now is how much of that money you think the actual developers are saying? I don't know necessarily a lot. There's a lot of controversy about call of duty. I don't know if you heard the whole thing, please tell him is. So basically the call of duty guys originally were uh, these guys, uh, from infinity ward and Jason and fence. Real good guys. And they, uh, had originally built this brand after working on metal of honor because they built up metal of honor and then that didn't work out for a number of reasons.

Speaker 7:          00:16:24       You can look all this up. They built the call of duty brand up and then basically a modern warfare hit, made a ton of money. They basically didn't see much of it and then they were like, screw you, we're going to go do our own thing. It's a very controversial thing with a lot of lawsuits and everything like that. Um, I just, I stayed on the site generally that the developers, because I believe in developers, riots, I believe paying people what they're worth. And when you create a multimillion dollar to potentially billion dollar brand, you deserve to be paid for it. Right?

Speaker 6:          00:16:46       So the issue is that the people that finance it or getting the majority of

Speaker 7:          00:16:49       about the large studio, uh, uh, activision basically, from what I can tell again, this is secondhand knowledge. You know, the guys basically did not feel that they were paid what we're worth for because when they have contracts, once your studio is purchased and you're part of a larger conglomerate, your game can make a billion dollars and they could just give your studio, have half a million, it'd be like, fine, we own you, like whatever, like, yeah, and I don't know what the numbers are, but you're increasingly seeing in the video game industry, people getting a lot of representation, people getting a agents, they're people you know, getting a proper accountants and lawyers and they're actually negotiating this sort of thing. So, you know, people like Warren Spector, her created Datastax, people like Ken Levine who created bioshock. They've got deals now. They're making amazing games and they're going to make sure that they and their staff are taking good care of. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:17:33       I remember back in the day when, uh, John Ramirez, it was broke off from id software and that was like the first drama in the game community that this Guy John Romero, who's the game designer splits from this Guy John Carmack, who's this fucking super from another planet

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       wizard guy. Yeah. He's the one of very few dudes. When I'm around them, I get intimidated. Yeah. Like when I'm talking to John Carmack, I'm like, why am I even talking about talking to this guy? Did you ever fucking alien? Yeah. Same sort of thing. This whole lake one in a billion type of personality genius alien do right. Like it's amazing. I thought another level than all of us and carmax would sit in front of the computer for people who don't know who he is, 16 hours a day code and then he would go make rocket scientist in his spare time. Right. It was involved with the x prize and I was like trying to win the x prize. That's his hobby. And when he wasn't doing that, he was turbo charging Ferrari's, building turbo charges for Ferrari. It's a big no, no, by the way, right there, like if it's like, it's like buying a Mona Lisa and just painting over it, right?

Speaker 4:          00:18:34       Yes. But he just doesn't have no reverence for any objects. He's like, fuck you. But it has an alien with the rumor was that like after he started doing that, that Ferrari kind of was like, dude, what are you? Come on, like we're undermining all of our engineers here. You, our, he still fucking with that shit. He was making like these 12,000 horsepower Ferrari's fucking nuclear energy die. Oh, for sure. Well he apparently was really nutty thrill seeker. He used to really like to go really fast, which is. Yeah. What happened was we cannot expect he left id software. The guys that do do this. John Romero guy to get back to this story. This guy was like the playboy character. It was like rock docstar and you know, and then they left. And what was that crazy game that they came out with afterwards when they did an acronym and diatonic diatonic that was the one.

Speaker 4:          00:19:17       So they. So he leaves and you know, it was like sort of a cult of personality thing. Oh yeah. There was. The big debate was who was the most important, is that the game designers have a guy with the vision or is it the coder and how easy it is to actually design the games. The game designers often the chaos and the programmer or producers usually the order, right. It's a combination of those two persons saying what's the best part of the band? Is it the singers and the drummers get. If you get the singer who could be on stage and be charismatic, you know, you get David Lee Roth but you don't have Eddie van Halen backing them up. Right. You don't have the magic. Right. And the example, he wasn't in Van Halen on his own, on his own. It was just David Lee Roth. He's gone, he's doing some cool stuff now.

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       Man. He's great. He's a great guy. I've met him. I met him at the comedy store, was one of the fucking coolest celebrity meetings I've ever had ever. But my point was that, you know, as a group, you know, those guys created some pretty fucking dope games, doom, doom, they created as a group. And the idea was that it was all this guys. So this guy leaves and he gets this giant fucking deal. Is John Romero, did you visit the Dallas Office? No, but I heard it was insane. It was like the top floor with a unbelievable views. Just stupid, crazy overhead. Right? This is legendary gaming history you're talking about. Yeah, yeah. Well this is how much of a Dork I am about this shit. And um, he uh, he gets crazy, crazy money and then to just lazy as fuck and they just barely working, man.

Speaker 4:          00:20:37       This game like takes forever to come out. It comes out all wonky and shit. And you walk through walls. That's an abbreviated version man. But I mean, the thing is, is he, he assembled a team so fucking fast and try to be so ambitious so quick. And that was with [inaudible] money. This is basically the Lara Croft tomb raider paying for this. Right? And so once you build a team that quickly, like you can't just overnight assemble a bunch of people, I can Hollywood and have magic, right? And so half, not half, but a good percentage of the guys I work with, my fucking art director, who's this amazingly talented, awesome guy, bled out of the eyeballs to ship. I katata he went to work for mirror because he thought Ramiro was a cool guy, but he still tells me stories about having panic attacks in Dallas and how he almost killed himself to Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       And so like I always look at that and realize how much you guys work dude. It's like if you look around the room, right? Every little bit, somebody has to work and build every last little bit of it. When we visited you and you were talking about when crunch time comes into, it's like right at the end and everybody's like basically sleeping at the office. That's all you do is you work with all dense. Gotten better than that with like we've, we figured out how to make games better now. Like you get a producer who knows his shit and it's kind of like, okay, we're not just gonna all work really hard to hope it turns out great. We're going to actually have a plan. Right? So if you say when it's done, that doesn't mean you really know what game you're building. At the same time, you need to have a little bit of wiggle room because it's not.

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       It's not a like a a definable process. You're, you're, you're panning for gold, you're trying. It's comedy. I like comedy. You iterate, right? It's so comprehensive though. I mean people don't understand what goes into making a game that just the amount of effort. I remember we were exhausted leaving thinking about the hours that you guys work, but remember we were talking about it, but dude, you can't burn through people that much. Right? You could maybe get away with a few crunches like that. So we're the point where it will do maybe 10 hours a day, 12 tops, five days a week tops, and then we, we, we call it. We're like, dude, if we just say it's not worth it, be smart. You know, because we're over 40 dude. Yeah. They just got fried, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. I'll tell you about that dike atonic thing though, even though it was like a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       It was a fun game to play. Man. Deathmatch deathmatch was fun on it. They had some cool to cool rocket, crazy weird rocket launcher. They haven't had a shotgun that had like 18 barrels or something like that. It was. They had some cool shit. You know, Romero was like supposedly like he was into first person shooters and death. Magical. It was him. It was him in Carmel and that whole crew that just birthed the genre. It's one of the lessons I tell the guys, if you have a new camera angle, you can create a whole new genre. The first quake was a fucking masterpiece for like death match. Brian says you're still hung up on it. Oh, well I'm still hung up on all games, but not really quick to quick to never really got me. But quake one dude. The only thing that got me about quick too, as the rail gun, that was very key because when.

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       That's when accuracy, it became very. You know what your problem, the fact that with quake two to actually balanced the weapons. No, no, I just didn't like the way it felt. It just didn't feel as good. It wasn't as fast paced. It was a little slower. Whereas quake one, you can move much quicker. It was much more like chaotic place. The numbers, it has to be point seven seconds or less. What it is is that I just really love death match. That's what I really love. That's all I played in college. A team death match. Like anytime it comes up with any sort of domination and CTF, might I just want to shoot people. How do you feel about those things that hook up to a console and give you a mouse and a keyboard of those good. I mean they're, they're cool and all. But do you. I mean the thing about halo is

Speaker 7:          00:23:47       they built the game of halo for that dual stick controller and if you're a pc guy is used to that level of accuracy. It feels like you're like drunkenly using like a rubber hose to a your car. But if you build a game for it, it can work. And that's what halo did. Golden, I did it before that. But you look at Halo, they basically introduced a genre that was new to a whole generation of kids. I have this whole 10 year rule where like the kids who played halo, most of them, many of them didn't play a lot of quake because they're like, wait, what does this new xbox thing? I'm gonna play this. And then they become hooked. It's like the. We talked about vampires on the way over. It's like, okay, well all these kids who love twilight don't know what buffy the vampire slayer is. So, but if you wait 10 years, right? Your kid who liked buffy the vampire slayer or you're a person who likes a twilight. They were what like, you know, six when buffy came out and now they're 16. And so they, they didn't know about that. So you can basically wait every 10 years and find something that was old and make it new. And then if you can introduce it with new technology, you might be good to go.

Speaker 6:          00:24:41       Yeah. Um, for people who don't know what we're talking about, those a hand controllers, the consoles, when you have a console, you have xbox or playstation, what they are, that's most people are listening on Itunes, the same help, but he's holding one up but they have a bunch of buttons on it. And with, with pcs, when you play with a computer, when you play online, especially your, what you're using is a keyboard and the mouse and what it is is for whatever reason, the keyboard and the mouse, you can just control it better. You're far more accurate, you're accurate with the keyboard as far as your movement, having four very specific buttons, right where your fingers are and you're much more accurate with your hand as far as like aiming. And that's where it came into play with games like quake is like aim, especially when the rail gun came about and became very, very important. So how do they optimize these games for these controls? Do they have auto aim or something? You get close, you're in the neighborhood of it and it'll.

Speaker 7:          00:25:35       There was one of the things that halo did was they kind of introduced this idea of friction and adhesions, so what you do is if you, when you move your, your console kind of stick over the enemy. The game actually slows down a little bit. Like it's like, oh, you want to hit them, don't you? And then it provides a little bit of that kind of assistance. Right. That would drive me crazy. Whole generation loves it right now.

Speaker 6:          00:25:54       Those fucks, those lazy constant march what it is, they don't even want to aim these fucking kids that a self righteous and titled Children Back when we were acquired, we aim. It was a pixel. That dude,

Speaker 7:          00:26:04       that's what it was, right? Your crosshair was this one pixel and you had to shoot. That guy's edbd had across the map, except for in quake one where you had to just hit them with a rocket launcher. The had radius of half a mile.

Speaker 6:          00:26:14       That was the cool thing about quick too is a lot of people would put their own crosshairs in. They would build their own cross hairs, but quick three that came out of the box, like a bunch of cool ones, you know, like figure out what was the best for you. Like I would have different ones for the rail gun, different ones for the rocket launcher. It's all. It's all customization, but it's insanity is what it is. I can't. It's a constant subject on this fucking side. Do you trust the pots or whatever it is? Millions and millions of kids that are perfectly fine with the two sticks and they're going to grow up pussies. We are. We're entering what I like to say, we're entering into the feedback list generation, right? Those kids growing up

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       with those consoles, this is the last, the fall of Rome. This was when they were getting drunk and throwing up and trying to get more food in that sort of is gluttony. He touched him. Joe, look at touch screens. Look at, look at connect. We're getting to a point where people don't need buttons right now, which you, right? Is that what's going to happen? Is it going to be like gaming with your fingers and. Shit like pointing where you want to do the Microsoft thing is Ryan, isn't it? That's. Yeah, that's what is that called? Connect men connect. Yeah. You don't need a controller and you. You stand in front of it and move around. I guess you haven't. Have you heard much about this? This is not that much. I know this is going to trip you out, so it's a camera that can track your body movements without anything on you.

Speaker 5:          00:27:24       You've seen the motion capture systems, right? You know the type that would set up with whereas a spandex and all that. This is a very light version of that where you just stand in front of the TV and it can procedurally form your skeleton and then track that. So there's a dance game. Dance Central, which is a ton of fun. Just playing with my niece over the holidays. You literally just dance right in front of it attracts your movement. It can judge your score. Here's where it gets weird. There is a video, like a microphone on it so it can do voice recognition and it's got facial recognition on it. So once you do the facial recognition thing, which makes you stay out of the room to kind of build an aggregate of your face, it, you then can just walk in the room. It goes, why hello cliff, look, oh Jesus fucking Christ. I smoke too much weed for that dude. I don't want my computer talking to me. You know what I want to see. I want to see imax movies like screens like where you walk in and you're all sitting there in the video game. So there's like 500 people all joining in plain. This huge video game

Speaker 6:          00:28:16       in front of you, like I told you about from doing standup. He said, my friend John [inaudible] has been doing these conference stand up. Things were there in front of it, some new technology where they get them in a room and he's got all these screens in front of them and they see him and he sees them live and he does standup. Really? He's like, he's doing a desk in front of like all these monitors. So he gets to see the reaction like yes, two way video. So he's watching the reaction. They're watching him live, it's like he's performing on stage, but he's nowhere near that. We're talking the shit. I would love that if I could do shows from my house and not have to travel all the time. That was good.

Speaker 5:          00:28:52       You Judge People's reactions, right? I mean that's what we're talking about iteration, right, and how much we panned for gold and we try and find fun and we fail a bunch before we figured out what it is. I mean, talk about Jerry Seinfeld's comedian, how much comedy they. They go to the little dive bars and they do a surprise appearance and they just bomb and then they figure out, okay, this joke work. That one didn't work, this one did. Right? It's, we find it's the same thing with game development. I know people in the restaurant business that try new menus, they figure out what works and does it. It's all iteration. Nobody. Very few people ever actually nail it right the first time. Right. We'll fail early and fail often, which I found is the key to so many instances of success in life. Right?

Speaker 6:          00:29:22       Well, you fail and then you find out what you don't like about what failed. Yep. No, and that's how you learn. Absolutely. You have to learn what you do and don't like and when you're doing something complicated, there's a lot of failure involved. For sure.

Speaker 5:          00:29:32       Keyboard man. It's a, it's still relevant but you know, it's the market split between fall between des, between like I see no controller is very important. I think like making it so it could be, you could do just sit there and do that. What I don't like though is when a lot of times I just want to sit back and play a video game in bed or I'm just trying to run through the forest. I don't, you don't want to sweat, you don't, you just want to, you want to lay back and just sit there with the controller display, right? You don't have to jump around like an idiot. Right. I sit here and go like this though, like tron style and just move my hands like Doo Doo. I'm going through. When they're working on type stuff like minority report, where are you gonna? Be able to just keep it like that so you don't have to like mark. There's a certain percentage of person, a lot of them out there, especially girls. If you handled the current console controller, they act like you handed them a flaming bag of dog shit. Right? Like really? I'm supposed to use this for what? Like I don't want to play this and granted there are some exceptions, but most people, parents like you're met with cliff. He being. That's a year old girl voice. That was a nine.

Speaker 5:          00:30:36       That's your becky voice. Oh my God. Yeah, exactly. And it's such an asshole. He is play a game. The. We have this whole theory that there's a certain type of girl that somehow gets that voice preloaded into her with that bubbled writing. I think they just imitate everybody else. It's like, why? Why would anybody have that fucking horrible Boston accent? Why? Because a bunch of other people have and they just imitate it still. I still miss it though, Dude. Do you really? How dare you, dude. I agree. I had a great time growing up. I miss it with as far as dudes. You know, you don't like the girls know Jesus Christ. Some of the most horrendous experiences in my life came out of a female Boston accent. Yeah, get some. Just gets too cold. Yeah. We had this experience where a buddy of a buddy of ours was in Boston.

Speaker 5:          00:31:20       He hooked up with some chicken while they're fooling around. She goes, he tell you friends, wait a monster sound. It was just hideous and he just fucking swinging it. And I got a buddy of mine. He dated a girl from Long Island and they woke up the next morning and he asked her what she wanted for breakfast and see what count. Chocula dude. So I took Lauren back to see my hometown. Right. Like I had to blackboard. What town did you grow up with that over north andover? Yeah. I mean it's totally like Nice suburbs, right? Like really? Like we went up in the fall, false. All the foliage, like the local farm standard. Rob is a kid is like this now, like national. What month was this? Was October. Late October is good. Was right before it gets horrible, horrible, horrible. And I'm sitting there and there's something about certain sections of the northeast that just kind of take something out of you.

Speaker 5:          00:32:07       I don't know if it's the Diet or the weather, but there's a certain tiredness that kind of creeps in. Man. I don't know what it is. Lack of vitamin D to lack of vitamin D. But there's something about the weather. You know, Italian food cold. Yeah. It's not supposed to be that cold for that long. We're just sucks. Well, you just assume that every year for four months it's going to suck to be outside. But I grew up. You grew up with it, right? Like I grew up and I had to get my. I do a paper route as a kid. Right. Me Too. And they deliver it and they deliver it in like a. They deliver the papers. In November, the snow would hit and I'd get up at 10:00 AM to do my paper and the, the it all be plowed over it. And I have.

Speaker 5:          00:32:41       My papers aren't there. I'm like, I guess they didn't deliver my calling for a refill sometime around late March, early April. That would thaw out and I would find the papers for March, like a time capsule and I'm sitting here going, is this how it is? Because my dad loved him dearly but he was super cheap about the heat and he'd like it 90 turn off and like in the Monday morning getting up and going to school. Oh, it's the worst. Like getting into that shower man. Oh, we used to have to use a hairdryer to unf on clog the pipes. The pipes would freeze. Yep. So my dad had like this opening underneath the floor in the basement and he would have to lift up this opening and it'd be sitting there with a fucking hairdryer before anybody could take a shower. But we retaliate who's retarded?

Speaker 5:          00:33:20       We grew up, my dad decided one year he was going to buy a coal stove that was going to like take care of all this. Right. So he gets it installed and literally like a one folly as two tons of coal put, like put it in the basement. Right. And we literally have to go down there with a hopper and like bring it up there. And you have to hold your breath, otherwise you get black lung basically. And we come up and like this thing he did like two square feet of the whole house. So if you want it to stay warm, you stayed in the living room and just hovered right in front of that thing. Oh yeah. We had four. I got four of the brothers, man, I've grown up with that in one house and it was a decent size house. But one of the.

Speaker 5:          00:33:50       What's that? I'm sorry. I had central air. You're spoiled. How old are you? What do you like? Fuck is wrong with you. Shit. Huh? One of the houses I looked at in Colorado had one of those wood heating stove in the middle of the living room and they were talking about how economical it is to use this wood heating stove to keep the house warm. I'm like, what are you fucking talking about? Hooker? I got kids and you've got a giant red hot ball of metal and the center of the living room, but they're just supposed to avoid. Dude. I used to say I was a kid. I used to take prongs with the hot coals and take them out aside from the living room, like through the hallway and go into the snow, like write my name with a blazing hot cold. Like how did that not like drop this on my foot and burn myself.

Speaker 5:          00:34:29       Right. I don't know. But in 2010 they should eliminate that stupid shit and get a God damn heater when you've got a fucking giant cast iron fucking in the middle of the rope. That was not common at all. Well you guys are talking about like, I didn't know anybody that had columbus gets pretty cold though. Man didn't have central heat or air. They're like, dude, what is this lake? The technology I guess can old heating and cooling in Ohio was better than. Well No, Columbus doesn't get death cold though. Right? What is, what is winter? What is it like a terrible January got negative 10. That's the real shit. That's cool. So yeah, I grew up with who are brothers, right? And we had to share a lot of shit. And so like we have to share towels in the bathroom. We only had a certain amount, we all took the golden lion and take showers.

Speaker 5:          00:35:12       Right, and I'm sitting there one day and I get out of the shower after my older brother and I take the towel and I'm kind of wipe my face and it's a light color towel and I realized the towels smells like ass. Oh Jesus Christ. I pull away and I'm telling this story to his daughter recently. She's like a little eight year old kid and her dad and I looked at the towel and I realized there's Brown streaks in the towel. Oh my God. This explaining to his daughter that this is a double fail because not only did

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       not remember to wash his ass, like he forgot to like wipe right and asked my niece. I'm like, what's the, what's the, what's the lesson out of the story? And she says by dark towels, I'm like, no, you're doing eight. That's brilliant. You're doing it wrong. No, that kid keep an ironer. She's Brown and red towels. Ideal match for me. That's. I would never thought of that in a million years. Have you seen that? That's a great line. You understands the genes and true story dude. Great Line, right? They have to tell. He can buy online. It's like one half is brown. One half is a white and says face and ass. It's like a split title. I it in my bathroom was good reminder. I would want a brown towel that looked like, like a dexter splatter of blood on it and that was the design of the towel bar that you can actually bite dexter is a shirt. The kill a thermally. Where's? Yeah. Do you. Did you do? Did you give up on Dexter Joe?

Speaker 4:          00:36:31       Mrs Rogan's really intuit though, so I'm going to have to try again dude. Even though John Lithgow that quit because of John Lithgow, shitty rear naked choke, John Lithgow get some woman getting her, gave her the fucking weakest bitch as rear naked choke I've ever seen in my life. I'm like, no, that's not going to kill anybody. That's me stopping watching a TV show because they're holding the controller wrong. When you try to kill people, man, they fight. They fight back. The cloche you, they kicked, they try hard. They don't just lay in the tub and go while you're choking them. Your little fucking old man arms didn't even put any pressure on that thing.

Speaker 7:          00:37:07       Amazing that season, dude. And you know welders on the season. Have you seen him lately? He looks like the most. I didn't even read that again. Who's a cop? Robocop first. Rub it and you're just like, oh my God, dude. I don't know. He looks like the sleazy, amazing. Like Miami pd guy. He looks great. It's still a good show in spite of the bad choke holds.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       Okay, well I'll give it a second chance. Watch walking dead. No, but I've heard. That's pretty awesome. It's the end was a little bit, but say that. Then I got nothing to look forward to. Frank Darabont fire the entire writing staff. Whoa. Yeah. He's a guy. He did shawshank redemption. Green Mile. Right. Wow. Fired the whole staff. It's hard to find fucking good writers. That one right. Your Shit. Yeah. No good writers want to write their own shit. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:37:49       Well let's just say. Well, I've had people approach me and they're like, hey, we were doing this a dual ip and we want epic to make the game. I'm like, dude, we do our own stuff, man. Like we can either create our own thing like years or we could do like the star trek movie video game. What's going to happen? Right,

Speaker 4:          00:38:03       right. We're not going to run inspiring. Nobody gives a fuck about those stupid movie video.

Speaker 7:          00:38:08       There's the occasional exception. That's a good one, you know, but it's hard to make like a superman for the Nintendo 64 game. Every etf for Atari to have my feet, you know, that's very desert, right? They actually, oh yeah, that's one of the craziest stories and urban legend story. It was the, the video game, right? And the Atari Twenty 600 and they basically assumed it would sell millions of copies and it sold like five. Oh my goodness. Decided to like bury out in the New Mexico desert and they actually is still out there. They buried it, buried it. Why

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       did it? Because I don't know. I guess they didn't confront somebody better and whatever disposal economics, huge landfill filled with that game and in fact many of them I don't actually know that you can look it up and we'd meet. What's the urban legend though? Well, people think it's an urban legend, but it's actually true, but what is the number in the urban legend? It's millions, millions, millions because they hired some programmer. It had to make the game over the course of a month. That's the license we can print. It will make money, right? Like no, you actually have to make a good game. Like the new call of duty was done by the second team, which previously had made a very solid one a couple of years ago and it had made a one a few years ago that wasn't as good, but they have really stepped it up. This new one. It like, I didn't even play the campaign, man. You did. You play it much? No, I've never played it. It's true. You should give it a government. I know you have dual analog fear. Can't do it. You have to try. You have to at least give him some time. What's going to happen with all the shooters are like emotional funnels. I guess I'll play pool. You gotta. Imagine going like this and playing pool. You don't even need a pool table.

Speaker 6:          00:39:29       No, no, no. You need a pool table, bro. That's the whole game. The whole game was. Did any of them feel the ball contact the queue? It's either feel the ball and how much, how much effort you put into your stroke, how relaxed your grip is. Keep your shit together. It's kind of stroke that ball son. You'll change the mind trying some different things. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:39:52       How do you do different things? Uh, I don't know. It's Disney. So it cost them 100. And did, did you move to 150 million? Do you know the guy who directed it is the guy who did the first gears commercial? The mad world one where really? Yeah, that was a joke. Fucking commercial was awesome. It was. I remember when that commercial was

Speaker 6:          00:40:09       coming out before gears came out, I saw it on tv and I went, whoa. Like they just nailed it.

Speaker 5:          00:40:15       It's a song as a perfect song to that song was actually one of my favorite songs, but I was going through all that up on youtube, right parental pull it up. That was one of my, like I was going through really tough time at that point. They actually didn't even know about that, so why don't you just call me. I would've snapped you out of it. That's ridiculous. Don't listen to that kind of music when you that kind of mood. I was that movie. That's a good song for

Speaker 6:          00:40:34       good mood to go. Wow. That's kind of a cool song. The last thing you want is when depressing ass fucking song when you're in a shit mood.

Speaker 5:          00:40:40       You remember it was a remake of the tears for fears song, right? Is that what it is? Yeah. It was a remake of softball and it caught a faulty off auto Kaunas side and then they just did. Gary joules redid it. It was like number one in the UK over the course of the holidays when it came out and then it had another like rebump like that. Put that commercial, put that song back the top of itunes for like a month.

Speaker 6:          00:40:59       What's that game was the last game that I played with on a console. It's the last day you didn't like your student? No, I played gears one. I fucking loved the way it looked. I loved everything about it, but that fucking thing was driving me crazy. Trying to move around and look what this stupid controller and I'm like, why is this have a mouse and keyboard? It will be so much easier. Like if I had a mouse keyboard, shit touching some fucking ass up in this bitch where it's just. It's, Oh, is gay already? Get this away from me. This away from me. You can't even. Don't

Speaker 5:          00:41:27       be a gaming dinosaur. I am dude. Also, the second one they did was called the last day. That was for curious to who? I like those features that was

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       aching. He Zoom in, right. Left trigger.

Speaker 6:          00:41:37       Right. Trigger is so slow. Can you adjust the sensitivity in the mouse? Yeah. Okay. Well it looks fucking spectacular. You're missing out. I'm missing out on a lot of things, man. I'm not skydiving. I'm not climbing rocks. That was all I needed to do. Brian's got a great story about his dad. We tandem set up a couple of times, but it's an interesting story. I'll tell it because he's told it twice. His father, um, had a person at work that was always saying used to go skydiving with me. I go skydiving. I love it. She used to go all the time. Well, she fucking died. Really? She fell out of a plane and her shit didn't work and their second shit caught up in her first shit that didn't work. Clatsop fucking went screaming to the ground from 10,000 feet in the air and slammed into the earth. Ending her time here. Fuck that noise about it. That afraid of death. I'm afraid of the screaming before knowing the sense of we're not even four minutes. How much time does it take?

Speaker 7:          00:42:36       Terminal Velocity? Ten thousand feet. I'm sure you could just figure it out. Three hundred 80 miles an hour. Three minutes, three minutes of terror. It look up a gears of war. Mad World Zero. That's what it was. Nobody. It seems like a lot of to have it on youtube so you can just assume that if something's out there, it's on youtube now. If you ever actually want to find, try and find somebody official music video. Good fucking luck. Because what they'll do is they upload a video where it's like, hey, here's what I think of Nicki Minaj, this new song, and it's like Nicki Minaj official video. You Click on it, they use the thumbnail to make it look like it's the video. And then some guy showing, talking about. You're like, can I actually find this frigging thing? Like usually the one that's actually has millions of hits is like the last one to actually appear. What's up dog? This is it right here. This is the ad. Damn. I want to watch it man. Tell these fuckers that. Go on Youtube. It really changed the game for a lot of video game advertising.

Speaker 6:          00:43:33       Fuck Yeah Dude. Dude. A lot. Also, you guys raised the bar so high as far as the graphic appearance of game when we were in your uh, we came into your office. It was, I guess it was like two years before this came out and you guys were deep deep in development. You had all these crazy models and all these, you know, it was mostly just demonstrations of the technology, but you know, I remember asking you like, what are you guys up to? Like, what's going on? And you're like, we're about to take a big fat shit on dual Dr Berman tonight. And then uh, then I went, oh wow. And I watched it and like the, especially the light, like a lot of the shit you had was like, demonstrations.

Speaker 7:          00:44:09       How the flash hiders go is that was awhile. It says 40. Think about where technology is going to be in a few years, man. It's going to be insane. Like if, if, if Sonia Microsoft getting around actually making next generation consoles, like imagine what that's going to be like, what is the bottleneck? I want it personally. I want, I want some avatar quality stuff, real time like that.

Speaker 6:          00:44:26       Imax, imax theaters. Imagine that concert where you're all together in a

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       world of warcraft everyday. Everyone would just plug into their computer and be some sort of an Elf. We'd just wandering through the forest and we'd all turn into the apartment on South Park with a whale episode. What's that fucking dangerous thing we're doing here? Because if we make games more exciting and way fucking cooler than real life, it gets weird. It's like it's a brain that's getting hooked up, right? Well, the scary thing is what happens when we can download consciousness into a computer singularity. She is too. I want to live in fucking Avatar, man.

Speaker 7:          00:45:01       You know? Well, you do about the whole thing about the singularity where I sure Ray Kurzweil and all that, right? Like it's, it's, I, I have a feeling that's within our lifetime. For those of you that don't know, Brian's little butter dog is attacking me right now with sweat. You know what a butter dog is? No serious slugs. I bet that Joe. No. What's a buddy of mine? He came in, he's a photographer from New York. One time we were doing a photo shoot for magazine and he's telling me how much he hated dating in New York City. I'm like, well, why? He's like, well, there's a certain type of girl in the city who's given up on the dating scene and she has what's called a butter dog, and I'm like, what? Like she's a good girl, but her dogs annoying. No. It turns out that this type of girl, and this might be an urban legend, he might've been fucking with me, but it sounded the way nut butter. Their boyfriend is their little dog with a little tongue, a little peanut butter and then that's their boyfriend for an hour now. So anybody who's from New York and confirm or deny this, if it's an urban legend, I would love to know.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       It's just a regional thing in Manhattan. It's your message boards that we can meet and greet other peers of enjoy everything, but yeah, I'm sure there's a message board out there for girls like to give their pussy licked my dogs. Have you guys seen this shit? That pirate base doing like attacking visa and mastercard because of this Wiki leaks thing? Yeah, they are. They are not hosting it and I did all the mastercard. You can make a donation and Wiki leaks right now. They're all attacking them and don't. This wiki leaks thing is fucking fascinating for people who don't know. And I just found this out today, already brought it up yesterday or day before when we had the podcast and then uh, was it yesterday? Yesterday, yesterday. I already brought it up yesterday at the podcast and then today I went online and started looking it up.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       The guy was arrested for surprise sex. Alright buddy. The guy was arrested because his condom broke and he didn't tell her that's the crime and apparently it's only a crime in Sweden, like this is nuts like that, an Interpol look to try to get this guy and bring them in for questioning. But this is the charge girls to try to get married that way, to put this woman that he did it with. The woman who he had sex with. This chick has published websites like with a detailed list of how to get revenge on men. It's this craziness. I mean the idea that this is enough to bring this guy into justice. The Internet is going to stop that man. There's some, some shit is going to go down from this and say I'm going to be this easy. It's really

Speaker 7:          00:47:14       hard for any organized system to fight because somebody somewhere is going to be willing to host something and how many places you're going to break down. Shut it down. It's one head of like, wow, this is fascinating. There's information I shouldn't be seeing that, you know, maybe some of it needs to be exposed and on the other hand I'm like, this is national security man. Like we're talking about serious stuff that could really put people's lives at risk. So I, I'm on the fence with it,

Speaker 6:          00:47:35       both sides of it. I can see both sides of it too, but I can't see defending against it. You know, I, I don't think it's right or don't think it's wrong, but I can't see stopping it from happening. When you fuck with people that are that powerful, they find some sort of way to get to you. I know, but that's what's fascinating about this is how transparent it is. It's incredibly transparent that all of a sudden this woman, who by the way has CIA ties follow my twitter, just go to Joe Rogan. There's a bunch of things that are tweeted today when I started researching about it and I'm not talking about. I'm talking about like CNN talking about legit news sources and they're showing all this, you know, how the connections are, what this guy is actually being arrested for. It's a fascinating thing, man. I'm Sarah resting him for having sex with no condom. This is consensual sex is not like any main. It's not rape, it's not assault. It's craziness and this is something that's like Interpol warning for him and go searching for him all over the place for having sex or you got extra day. That's insane. Did he get extracted from London to Sweden? Yeah, it's craziness. It's really good. Really

Speaker 7:          00:48:33       transparent. Transparently. Those things didn't happen sooner. I remember sitting there and uh, I had a friend right about the time we were working on real one. This is about 97 and I went over to his house and he was downloading like full high quality, like Hollywood movies off of a website and this was [inaudible] 97. Wow. I'm sitting here going and now it's like bit torrent is everywhere, right? Like, it's. And you have a generation that doesn't want to pay for shit. Right? Right. Like the Scott pilgrim movies. You see that Brian? Yes. One of my favorite movies out of nowhere. I can't believe they pulled it off. I thought it was a meet Edgar Wright who did Shaun of the dead, right? It was just a great movie. And what happened was a bond at the box office, but at the same time it was like a perfect movie for the Gamer.

Speaker 7:          00:49:10       Neurogeneration write a hipster generation even. Right. And uh, I saw somebody tweet about it. They're like, Scott Pilgrim is the movie this generation. The problem is this generation doesn't pay for shit. Right. I had a friend of mine one time, she posts on her facebook. She's like, oh, I saw the lovely bones. It was amazing. And it was two weeks before the film came out and like, you're posting this on your facebook, did you get like a screener from somebody in la or something? She's like, no, I tore into that shit. Yeah. People just admit it. Just talk about it openly on people's doors. Like the music industry, right? Nobody wants to be the fucking music industry right now. Mark my words, we have to get rid of currency and make it likes because all those people would have liked it. And so then you just want to collect likes, like they're not even money that's going to be the currency in the like sixth grade.

Speaker 7:          00:49:48       Do you like, like me, like me? Yeah. But it's kind of point. I mean, you know what I mean? Because that's all you're going towards. And that's like the new currency would be a good idea. It's actually some sort of a revamped idea. Have you ever actually tried to, unlike anything on facebook, it's a nightmare. Yeah. But that's how it should be. Yeah. It's like, it's easy to get calmed down. Drama Queen. Just to think about this for the crazy bitches. You're really disliked cupcakes and really you know, you like what's with the thumbs down? Why is the 32 thumbs down and 1 million thumbs up? Who you 32 people I want to know who pays for those things like gifts is that they're calling. You're paying like $3 for a balloon to put on somebody's facebook and that was a part of facebook or are you talking about like the lytic? You've got a button or something. Buttons. That's what it was. Virtual goods. Huge. Yeah. I'm not into it. The whole rage right now in the industry is they called freemium. Really? It's like the game is free, which is a brilliant idea in a bad economy and so you start playing it, but hey, you see that guy who is the fancy cowboy hat? You could have that dollar

Speaker 6:          00:50:49       me ask you. What do you think about this? What do you think about games where it's like like everquest and shit where they sell the character that like build up some crazy super human character and then they go sell it to digital farming. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. There's

Speaker 7:          00:51:03       places where they just. They busted for world of warcraft where they'll sit there and they'll just farm.

Speaker 6:          00:51:06       Yeah, I watched that on TV, man. There was this couple. There was all about addiction of gaming. I don't know what the show was, but it was a sad, sad couple men because they weren't paying attention to their kid. Their poor kid was like, Mommy, Daddy. No, no. It was a real TV show. It was at and the one of the things that they had is a. all these people that were in, I think it was like Russia or somewhere like that, that were playing games for a Americans. They build up their account. They play all day, and then they sell it.

Speaker 7:          00:51:32       This is the fundamental tradeoff that you have right now is you get to the certain point, we realized there's people often talk in the industry about kids versus adults. Kids have no money and all the time adults have very little time and half the money, and so which audience are you? Right? If you can have a person who's can get paid, you know the equivalent to five cents an hour and every hour you can earn a dollar's worth of gold. That's a business model for somebody, right? I don't think blizzard is a fan of that. Right? But once you have eyes, like I laugh often talk about the seven deadly sins is game design, right? Like I walk into this world and I see you with your fancy, you know, two girls went up, shirt on and I'm like, Ooh, I want one of those. How do I get that?

Speaker 7:          00:52:05       And then I envy you. Right? And then I wind up getting greed so I can collect money and then I want to get in too many into wind up with gluttony and then it's just all these start factor into each other. And once you have eyes, it's the way the world works. You see the guy with the nice car. It's like, oh, I envy him. I want that nice car. You can apply that to the virtual world. Exactly as you can apply it to the real world. You don't blizzard and world of warcraft, I don't know the exact numbers, but they had released a pet whereas it was like 25 actual dollars or something like that and their servers wound up getting crashed. People lining up to buy it just for like one little pet.

Speaker 6:          00:52:33       That's the power of what they've figured out how to do is make it so that the more you play the game, the better you get. The better your life is. The more successful you are, the more powerful you are, the better the experience is, the more you have control of the people in the game. And that's like the really trippy thing. It's like it's a time thing they like locked you in like it's, it's a, it's a show that you're totally hooked on and it never ends and it keeps getting crazier. New

Speaker 7:          00:52:59       People and they, any, any blizzard, mark my words has created this mold that so many other people in the position going to follow. We get this, uh, this thing in the new gears and we have a calendar. It's like you play gears and it's like, Oh hey, you know, don't trade in your game because in two weeks there's like ticker Tuesday or triple sp Thursdays. Right. And then your friends are playing on that same day and you want to keep going. Right. And maybe there's like a psychologist trick. There were like, you know, you don't sell the game because you're thinking there might be something coming up. Right? We're dungeon masters and we're always like manipulating experience online to have

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       new shit happen. Yeah. It's kind of crazy that it just keeps going though. But I mean your average person have over their life. Right? So in a world where you start gaining that control as like the biggest problem is like when you're young is figuring out what you want to do when you grow up. Right. Like that. Thankfully I was lucky and I saw games. I was like boom. That I've talked to kids are like, I'm going to school and I don't know what I want to do. It's like, dude, pick something and be surgical about it and decide that you're gonna be the best at that. But the problem is finding something for a lot of kids, the real issue is finding something. Then you got lucky. I got lucky a lot of people did, but it's like it's very difficult to find the thing that you're into know you don't want to like say, oh, it's going to be this, and then you're doing it and then halfway into you're like this fucking belonging.

Speaker 4:          00:54:07       So it's difficult to find what that thing is. It's like asking, asking it a young, especially at a young age when you don't know, you hardly know a lot about what's going on in the world around you. But at the same time, that opportunity now with the internet is greater than ever. Right? Like you could shoot a viral video, you could start a podcast, you can do anything. And if you start getting better and better at it, you can build community, right? If that's what you want to do. But what if you want to be a carpenter or what if you want to be a painter? You know, there's so many. For kids, the hardest thing is finding the thing, finding whatever the fuck it is like you know, most kids don't get enough exposure to interesting ideas between the schoolwork. When you, when you go to school, when you think about what you gotta do, you gotta get up at fucking 7:00 in the morning.

Speaker 4:          00:54:43       You've got to leave, catch a bus with a bunch of other Douche bags, do a bunch of shit that sucks all day. Listen to a bunch of people tell you never going to make anything out of your life unless you pay attention to them and they're like, listen bitch, you're teaching school. I know you don't make any money. Shut the fuck up. Don't you love how life is so great when you're a kid like no the other moments, but it sucked. So to find something that you truly love in the midst of all this, like programming is what school is no more than programming. It is education. There is information that you're going to download, you're going to remember it, but the reality of what it is is getting you program to get used to doing things you don't want to do. Listening to people that you don't want to hear, you're around people.

Speaker 4:          00:55:19       You don't want to be around. There's a Buzzer, but wide. Why does there have to be a buzzer? Stupid? What is it so important that we fucking leave at a certain time and get there at a certain time? You're turning me into a robot. You know you're turning me into some worker asshole that just goes and does the same goddamn thing everyday. Providing order for a certain mind that might otherwise to just the devolvement. Again, there's ways to educate people. A little teasers. My favorite hobby is if I'm out with friends and I was out in San Francisco with a buddy and he had a date. Who is this? A public school teacher at any time I find one of my polaroid, I'm like, America, me buy your drink and it will just sit there and pick their brain for like an hour about. My uncles were public school teachers.

Speaker 4:          00:55:53       They have horror stories. Oh of course. Teaches in New Jersey. Yeah. Like so you know the classes that are huge, like kids who are young, like super young hooking up and bathrooms. They have to call child protective services. It's a horror story of well you know, they're all doing crazy shit now too because of the Internet. You know, you hear like 13 year olds are talking about, you know, making out with other girls. There was no girls making out with girls when I was 13. That shit never took place. They're all doing it, you know, 13 year old girls. Yeah. That was the, I knew a lot of 13

Speaker 5:          00:56:23       year olds, dude. None of them were making out with each other and everybody would say they were going to do something and you never knew quite what it was. Right. And there was this kind of like adult conspiracy to keep like pornography or away from you and things like that. You had to go to the woods and find porn. We've talked about this 100 times on the poc finding, finding the woods. So funny. Everyone's got the same story. Everybody dirty stuff. We didn't bring this up to you and everyone has the same goddamn story in the magazine. You shouldn't make an adult bookstore in the woods. It'd probably be the most successful. I just don't even have any signs. Here's like a Johnny Porto Ct. It looks like ron jeremy and going through with a giant sack of porn and it's like, yeah, cherry a playboy. It's the dirtiest shit you could find. It was the bad stuff we grew up with. oh, your dog. There we go. It was always penthouse with a lot of water damage. It was always the girls. I like that. The sarlacc pit down there. It was horrible, right? Getting your young impressionable mind is like, oh my god, I was supposed to think this is hot. What is going on heRe? And it was terrifying. When you click of a button, you can see two girls. One cup.

Speaker 6:          00:57:24       Yeah, we, we've talked about this before about how crazy it is, how close all this stuff is. Like someone can send you a twitter link and you click on it and Just give me the most horrible

Speaker 5:          00:57:34       mark my words if I ever have children and they were not going to get a cellphone until they're maybe 13.

Speaker 6:          00:57:40       Yeah. But you know what the worst thing you want to have is an uninformed kid. True. when all the other kids talk to them and just let them be in the same flow as everybody else, just to let them know what the fuck is going on while, as long as that basis there. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's the old expression, the kids are going to be all right. You know, and there they are. They're going to be all right. They're going to be fine. She's like, we're fine. We're worried about them, you know, and I have little daughters and logically, you know, I can say this and of course, you know paternally, I just want to protect them in the fucking world. and all that, but I understand where that's coming from. These kids are going to be fine. They're growing up with other humans

Speaker 5:          00:58:18       to some extent. You want them to make their own mistakes. Right? I've known parents, yes, pad the house of too much and it's like let them

Speaker 6:          00:58:23       fall over once in a while. Let them learn how to balance, right? Like, well, yeah, but you know, you gotta be Careful. You don't want them to be kids die, you know, they don't have a stove in the middle of the living room right now. But I mean if you have hard floors, you know, like I have marble floors. It's kinda tricky. You know, you gotta you gotta watch them. But, but that's not the point. The point is, you know, what these, they're growing up with other people and I think things always get better and even though it seems like shit's worse, even though it seems like shit's worse as far as like the economy and all this craziness as far as invasion of privacy and you know, and uh, the, the, the access to information that we have and they're getting inundated with images and videos and all this shit that we didn't see it until we were well mature. They're goIng to be fine. They're just, this is how they're grown up now. This is just how it is. And we're just the old people that are just like our parents, like, oh, kids these days don't get on. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:59:12       Same video games.

Speaker 6:          00:59:14       It's just weird. Like we're like kids these days with her fucking ass to mouth porn. you know, they've got asked her mouth porn on their fucking iphone. Well, just what it is. It's just

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       this is the new world and the world constantly keeps getting more and more complex world of estimates. It's, the world is always getting more and more fucked up. It's always getting more complicated, more so bizarre. Is it going to the zombie apocalypse is the look. I think as long as there's freedom of information, the way we were expressing each other right now and communicating with each other, people are gonna be able to figure out things quicker, you know, and I think kids are going to be able to figure out this multifaceted, fucked up chaotic world far quicker than some fucking doofus from 1963 now he takes some kid from 1963. You can talk them into anything they didn't know shit. Now today kids are going to be more savvy, more aware and more innovation to ask anybody anything anymore who will fuck it up? You can find it.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       Right? It was. Wasn't was complaining about this actually he was a. There was steve wasniak when the creatOrs of apple's doing an interview where he's saying back in my day, you know, you had a. If you had a question, you had to find a smart person and ask them, well that's dumb. Why would I? Why are you complaining about that? There's not that many fucking smart people, but I've got to seek out one dude that's retarded. I have To go and talk to the professor. That's why they're so god damn arrogant about their estimation thing about the mayans. RIght. If they used to control them by the, you know, all the quote priests, you know, figured out science and figure it out, you know, how the, uh, you know, the lunar cycles and how everything would turn out. and then like, everyone's like, wow, how did they know this?

Speaker 4:          01:00:34       It must be magic. Or like we're controlling this through knowledge, right? Yeah. Well, there's now before the library of alexandria burned down, they had. I mean, that was the idea as well. They, they kept all the knowledge. they had all this information about all sorts of different things that the lay person was unaware of. So everybody can get it. Google bitch. Damn you. We used to have to seek out a tim sweeney, eric john carmack and hang onto the and right up to the top. That's true. Now there's just fucking computer connection to the internet and all your questions answered, but it's not always true to not. Oh, that's the thing is, but it's getting there. It really is getting closer and closer. It's getting to the point. There's a lot of misinformation, but there's also a lot of information. There's a lot of good information and I think that's good because I think it developed just like we need to be able to discern between bullshit and reality and the real world need to be able to discern between bullshit and reality online and people will sort it all out and figure it out.

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       You know, if you know, there's a lot of people that have it. There's a lot of urban myths about all sorts of different things. You know, if you drink a coke and take the, you know, fucking this with it, you'll die. You know? I mean, how many different stories, if we ever heard when they just go pop rocks growing up. Yes, that's right. That's what it was. It was mikey from the life cereal commercial died. His stomach explodes right when there was the urban legend about the girl that stuck the hotdog in her pussy and then had to go to the hospital. You never heard that one? Didn't hear that one. That was the other one there. All the maggots were starting coming out of her ass. And then there's the one about the lobster that right. You heard that one rIght? What was that one?

Speaker 4:          01:01:56       That girl apparently took less than one lobster. Put it in here. Then like lit a match to it to make its tail flip around and turns out the lobster head, like planted a bunch of eggs in her and then three weeks later she died the tub. IT's like, yeah, yeah, I can certainly See thAt some disgusting giRL wAs shit breath telling me that story. It really seems like life is going towards like the having a matrix where you live a bubble and your whole life is like you're in suCh a harsh. She took this lab staff. She's stalking and helpless here. Right? Right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:29       And it was fuCking lobster traps all his eggs in a snatch. It was a lobster fest until fucking labs is a crime and I have a pussy. What a whore. Think that's the case that that life is going towards where we're going to be in a bubble in our whole life is going to be some kind of like matrix style cocoon where we're all working for the people who actually have people skills will suddenly, everybody's to know how to be connected and how to get all this data. RIght. But those, you actually can interact in real life will actually do pretty well if you've got a combination of that. It's interesting to try to speculate as to what exactly was going to happen, but we all know that something's happening and that's the most interesting thing about this conversation is that we all are just admitting like everyone's saying is no one saying, well, this is going to stop and everything will level off and then we'll just, you know, go fishing, go faster than ever though exponentially.

Speaker 4:          01:03:16       Right? Yeah. It's moving in a weird direction when you were talking about that smart dust, you know, and uh, you know, the ability to track you and little particles that can hang on to you and three d computers and this whole wiki leaks thing. I mean, what would the transparency of the whole process now seeing this guy get arrested for not wearing a condom and there's tracking him down like he's a killer and that is the main thing. He's done wrong. He didn't wear a condom. Nobody knows. Nobody knows anybody else involved that though, right? He's the one who's like willinG to stand up there and take it on the chin as the face of this whole operation. I don't understand the whole story. I need to look into it more and I hesitate to say anytime anything involves anything political, I always just, you know what it's like watching a tv show that's fucked me over.

Speaker 4:          01:03:57       you know, this show sucks. You're not getting me again. I'm not going to watch your stupid show. And that's how I feel about politics. So I wouldn't anything like this is in the news. I'm like, fuck you. My time is valuable. You guys are all crazy. You're all full of shit. Kiss my ass. I'm not paying attention, but as this is getting further and further along, I'm getting sucked in because it's so surreal. Yeah. It's so strange. You don't really. Only a certain percentage of the cables were actually released. It was something like $20,000 out of like three or 300,000 or something. Fucking panicking, man. These politicians are panicking. They're going to know all these other nations are going to know what kind of shit we talked about them. You have a hard time containing data though. Even in my business, it's just like, oh, suddenly something just appears as a rumor on a website.

Speaker 4:          01:04:36       It's like, how the fuck it is amazing. It's interesting. It's somebody's profitinG by this because I know in the gaming industry, If you're going to leak something too, like you know a video game website, you're not going to make money and hope somebody wouldn't have two beers at a pub and tell him something like that. It's people run with it. Right? That's one of the most fascinating things about bit torrents and all this stuff. It's almost like people feel compelled to contribute. It's like there's a, there's a like a human urge to put information and stuff available online. Like before people were getting chased down. People love the idea that you could go to their site and get a bunch of shit. Yeah. You can get a bunch of shit from them and they, they, they love to be. Yeah. They love to be distributors of it, you knoW, it was so common. There were so many

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       different sites that had illegal shit and there's got to be like a human nature thing where you just want to like share and host and have community and remember where's, where's sites? YeAh. I mean that's different than bit torn p, don't people don't know that there was these weird fucking hidden sites. We can go and download yours with z. Yeah. W a r you go and Mexico suarez and they got all shut down. They've and figured out how to stop them, but then this whole peer to peer thing came up and the peer to peer thing is too confusing for people don't know. It's like when you were downloading, so if you're getting a movie, you're not getting it from one person. You're getting it from like 100 people or more even. You're getting all these files and somehoW or another they're compiling your computer.

Speaker 5:          01:05:56       Yeah, but it's craziness because you're taking all these ones and zeros from like 30 different places and then the final product is illegal. Yeah. Like, whoa, what are you saying that. How do you, how do you track? Right. Where did it come from? Somebody had it. If the one person that had it, there's one illegal copy, right? And then they're all illegal. but what if there's one legal? So here's the key is to provide a service that people are willing to pay for. Why do you think hollywood's betting on three d so much right now? Right? It's like, okay, what are we going? What are you gonna actually do think that's adding a third dimension and the key to that as nfl, I don't think it's porn and I fell. It would be dope too. There were filming all ufc isn't thredup, ufc in three d that that'd be genius.

Speaker 5:          01:06:30       Right. Then it's an event, right? like filmed a bunch of them already. I want, I want my three d to be an event. I want to go see avatar, toronto and three d. I dOn't want to go see like meet the foCkers six and three d. I don't really care. Right? Yeah. In my house, like you know, I don't really need to see like, you know, your average rental in three d, but when there's an event, there's a fight, there's a superbowl. I will, I'll put mY glasses on to watch that movie. Something fucking super like the more I watched you. I'm sorry. The more watch tv in three d though. It's not really about that. I think why they're trying to make all the movies, three ds and all the games. Three d is to make it to the point that what we're going towards is like walls of tvs or like I was saying, the imax movie theater where it's going to be the bubble, aren't you? Well, the three 60, like I think they're really trying to push that, that not the three d part, just the depth part of it. So that's what it's going towards. A bigger screen. Do you think that they can do that? Eventually there'll be able to create an image that looks three dimensional without actually having to have glasses and you see the nintendo three ds? Yeah. They already have it already have it. but does it look like

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       you remember when we went to that? Um, I don't remember where, where the place was we went to and we saw some, some sort of a big screen was in an austin. They had a big screen that was, um, it was a three d thing. They have super dope. It was in best buy somewhere in.

Speaker 5:          01:07:45       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was. Remember they had, it was incredible. We were watching that monsters. Monsters versus aliens. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was insane. The depth was so fucking gripping. I was like, this is like given me like a mental boanerges to watches like thrilling. So now it's like it's so alive with like visuals, you know? Your story doesn't always have to be the most original thing, but if you can provide something silver somebody never seen before, that's why we play games. That's why we go to the movies, just to get away from the shitty day to day, monday life. That's why there are people who love avatar so much that are when they leave it right, because they created this whole virtual world. They just wanted to do exist as me. Man. I wanted to go there. I wanted to lead. When I read about that movie, I'm like, it is like the.

Speaker 5:          01:08:25       So it's blue people means for golly, and I'm watching. I'm like, oh this is cool. That was a perfect example of depth though. When you saw avatar for the first time, how like that one scene where they're going down, they're pulling out something like a dead body or something like that. Long hallway, you know? That's what it seems like. Everything that I've been watching regular tv in bed for like a couple months now and even like regular tv shows that, that they have like a reaction that makes the tv try to make it in three d, that reenactment recreation of trying to make it three and even shows like that. You're just watching tv and you're like, wow, this background is really far back. You know, so it seems like everything is going for depth nowadays that the technology is going to be like us in a pod and we're just going to sit there and get communicated back.

Speaker 5:          01:09:11       Exactly. That's what it seems like we used to the what? That they can't go back. So it is with hd are familiar right now. Right. But never underestimate how many people don't have the money or the upgraded conversation I ever said. Sorry. We don't like we, we, we can track how many people have hd versus standard definition, televisions and games. Right? Based on their settings. And it's actually not as many people as you think have hdtv still to this day, they still have a great percentage of rural America that's still doesn't have broadband. Right? There's so many people that lag behind it because it's just not a priority for them. Right. You'll always get your early adopters. You guys like you who have 3d. There's still tons of people out there. Like I stream all my stuff on my xbox, like when I saw the red box, you go to the supermarket, we're out where I live, and like a friday night or the college, there's a line out the door at the for the red box.

Speaker 5:          01:09:53       And I'm like, what is this? Right? It's just, it's, it's blockbuster condensed into one box that you just read. Right. And it's huge. Not everybody has the broadband and has an xbox set up. They can easily stream everything from the comfort of their living room. Right? But not everybody had electricity 200 years ago. Yeah. I mean it's like it's all, oh, we got to keep pushing forward. Right? So going to eventually going in the same direction. It doesn't matter how many of these hillbilly fucks don't catch up with no broadband in 2010. I got no fucking time for you, but you need to move stupid. You know you need to fucking get your family out of the woods soon. Come on buddy. It's like there's not going to be carpenters anymore though. It seems like you were saying like if you want to be a carpenter, like how is this person going to find like a his job and stuff?

Speaker 5:          01:10:33       That's what's going to happen. There's not going to be houses anymore. We're going to live in pods. Where will we have gigantic three d computers or three d printers that we set up that build a house? Is that what it will be? There'll be something. It'd be like a cocoon of a third dimension wall that wraps around your body. You don't want to live like that. You're not going to be able to live a bomber style, but what if you're young and you grew up with that? You don't need that much space and you prefer the virtual world over the real world. Right, and you're. You're perfectly comfortable running around a virtual field for a real one and wouldn't be going to be inevitable. Maybe it will be. Get so dope that why would you want to live in the real world? Stupid. Maybe the the, the fake world will be so talked about. What if you could just go and you remember when

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       her virtual reality was all the rage in the noodles with a giant dick and and eyes that can see through walls and there's no racists and racism and perhaps some money that has ever been printed. It's all yours. No penis. We all have faulty penises and you can just go to other world. You can travel to other worlds. You can do anything. It's not real. We can make it their own world, right? That's the million dollar per billion to a trillion dollar prize. Everybody wants to go for, for games to give you that your dream that you can ultimately control. Well, let's think about this man. I mean, what is imagination? Imagination is some sort of energy that allows you to think up something that isn't there and create it and now it becomes real. It manifests itself in the real three dimensional world and you can beat on it with a hammer.

Speaker 6:          01:11:53       It all comes from imagination. So imagination is like some real creating force were, but nobody really ever knows where that comes from. is it coming to your environment is coming from like what you're exposed to, like what is it? Well, they also the concept of the muse that the urine antenna and that you're tuning into all the energy that's out there and I'll just, you know, you just sort of some sort of another process. it just like, you know, like a satellite dish pulls it out of the sky and makes these numbers ones and zeros and do this. But it's true. I mean when you, when you Look at what imagination is, I mean it really is some sort of an energy, something that exists in the mind and that it's ether role and then it becomes a solid thing. It becomes a miller lite, you know, becomes a computer, it becomes a microphone, you know, and this, all this is eventually got to move further.

Speaker 6:          01:12:36       Right? So if, if the imagination of all these thoughts can become a real thing by someone getting out and and sawing some wood and nailing some things together, eventually it's going to become something through code where you can alter things not with a hammer and nails, but you can use your mind to create a real world that could be 100 percent real with your imagination applied operating system that tunes into neural interface and becomes a part of you and you and this operating system connect to some sort of a computer or whatever the fuck it is, whether it's wireless or whatever, and then all of a sudden you enter into a tangible third dimensional three dimensional world that you control. Then you upload it into it. What the fuck man? And we leave meetspace right? Space, but think about what happens when the meat dies and he's just rot and then someone has to come along and clean you.

Speaker 6:          01:13:25       They have to recognize as a whole in the matrix and see you fight it weird. That is 2010 and we still bury people in the ground scam. We should address those people up and fucking dancing around like we need to burn them when you're talking about stupid. I think that'd be a play. They should be the respect for the guy and it's like six months long. So crazy. You got to burn them. It's so dominant. The cost. So much money to bury people. Man. I was at the duncan show, the, uh, at the cemetery. Yeah. What's it called? Uh, the hollywood cemetery. It's got some weird show he does at the hollywood sign. I had the gears launch party. Yeah. Yeah. That's where the gears are that sign, this form. They do movies and shit there. Yeah, it's awesome. It's like a hip, really weird cemetery. But they comedy, they do a comedy show there and we were there. And so it was the first time I'd ever been around, um, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       gravestones in a long time and they'll like, they'll all high tech now. They'll have like laser etched people's faces and shit into the gravestones. Did they have like video screens and stuff like the sopranos and stuff like that on the laws and like Harry Potter inside the. Inside the what I'm talking about where the dead people are. Yeah. Where the dead people are. The, the headstones there, there, there, there, there were like high tech now. Yeah. Like the whole place is like, just like a trendy place like that. So even there's like neon lights around like some of the graves and there's these digital candles that flick. It's like this, like a hip, you know, you do is ridiculous. What you do is if you die, you have a live streaming thing that as a twitter hashtag with your names to shout outs. Yeah, totally. I wouldn't give a shout out the gravestone number. Forty two. Everybody who died, he still has a facebook.

Speaker 5:          01:14:57       Oh his wife updates is facebook all the time. You and shit like that. I've known people in. It's weird. They, they almost hot you on facebook. They keep popping up and like and stuff that aren't tagged like tagged me and it's just a. You'll be in the middle of the day just eating your lunch and it just pops up. You're like, oh man. Like it's a weird, sobering reminder in. You're not going to delete it. It's this weird kind of ghostly memorial to that person. Right. And the trivial way. what happens when that person starts responding though, and it's not like there's a twilight zone, right? It starts with the poke right button and you're like, I think the assence kicking in, there's this article in fast company talkIng about how twitter is kind of taken over in certain ways and how basically during the maze this year they had like twitter projections on the wall of like the number of hits like each artist got and there had life youth, what people are saying about each artist and so we're.

Speaker 5:          01:15:46       We have a generation right now that wants to interact 24 slash seven. it started with the remote control and now like it's not enough. I know friends who've been sitting there texting other people and I'll say something like, hey, do you wanna go to the you wanna go to the store and they'll be like, did you actually hear what I what I just said? And they'll be like, yeah, you said you wanna go to the store while they're in the middle of typing an email. the human mind is adapting to this kind of multitask ability. It's not just enough to sit down and watch something you need to. You need to a her feet, you know, we're playing an online game and in between rounds were tweeting at the same time. Right. You have to keep doing something and doing multiple things. Otherwise the brain is bored.

Speaker 5:          01:16:15       You know what? I don't think it affects traffic as much either because I think the majority of people that have like the, the, the, the google maps, live traffic view sorts that out from people that are just sitting there, twittering our mom and driving slower. Like it cancels each other out because now we have better technology so we know where to drive better and where the traffic is. So that equals out the other retards, they just sitting there twittering and slowing down traffic at different way. So what do you think about that? Your steering wheel with a shit about your phone to the center of your steering wheel. Now I did. I just did this side straddle thing. I looked down at the map. I'm like, okay, gotta turn right up. You're at the point where like you're, you could feel the tug of your phone in your pocket sometimes.

Speaker 5:          01:16:56       Oh yeah. We're just like, oh, I just want to look, you know, having a twitter fan base and just seeing you, you, you post something before you leave the office or whatever and you're driving on the road, you just learn to know what they're going to say. Right, right. I just want to respond to that in itself is having a communitY, right? That's incredibly addictive. So if you have an instant response from thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people, right? Like how could you not want to know if they're gonna say and half the time it's the same thing and half the time it's something new. Right? Totally. Yeah. It's very addictive, very addictive, just wanting to know what's going on Because every now and then I'll check twitter and someone will turn me onto something really amazing. Right. You know some incredible fucking video or something.

Speaker 5:          01:17:30       A little weirded out by the links though. Like you just worry about clicking on it. Like, hey, check out this video. This cat who farts while he burps and you're like, Macedonia. Do you have, don't you use a mac? No. Oh my, my, my, the big, the big apple cherry popper from you was the ipad man. Oh yeah, totally. I love it. Yeah. You got to get mammograms. The not clicking on links nowadays. Who cares? Right. You don't worry about viruses. Don't worry about anything. I'm still a pc guy. That's what we develop on at work. Right. That's all nice. But it's nonsense. Yeah. You got to have dessert. Like being a person who's allergic to peanuts and you're eating everything blind, hoping you don't run into a peanut. Yeah. fair enough. No, it's silly, right? Is this ustream.tv or [inaudible] dot net.tv. Fuck. What's the difference?

Speaker 5:          01:18:13       The wrong link on my twitter page. You put it up for you. I'll put up the wrong length. These people can't take the piss anytime you want to get up here. Just business wise for cables. He's been here before, man. Trust me, if you want to pee on my dog, she's out back. She likes iT. Dogs love p man. You know what's crazy about video games nowadays is that angry birds game. There's a bird, a game. I don't knoW if you heard that. ninety nine cents right now. I think it is, but that game is sold so many fucking ninety nine cent apps that. What does it look like? Spielberg is going to be making a movie with brad pitt any day now as an angry bird or something. That's how crazy you know what you're talking about. This is a game on a that you can get on your iphone.

Speaker 5:          01:18:55       You could also get it on the droid and stuff like that. it's called angry birds. Uh, it's so has sold like shitloads of digital copies to the point where that game, it's like making millions for a ninety nine cent video game. It's gotten so big that now they're making it for ipads. They're making it first console's, but now it's like there's even a movie maybe in the works that's coming out. So what does with the numbers, like how many millions? Millions. Lost millions. Yeah. Yeah. What would you say? Three point $7 million today. just taking ralphie may. that's what we're going to call them now. It's a. Ralphie may make up a number. I'm going to ralph number. Remember that? And then we looked up to thousands of people started as black as coal people died. Gang ralph. He's a great guy and he's very funny but still fucks with numbers. You know, he's not where he doesn't suck it numbers. His popularity of that episode is one of the fastest, most popular episodes. Popular man. we had so many people love crazy mad fans. Ralphy ralphie

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       and this was ralph. He was the one who was the best at capitalizing on that last comic standing show. He did it better than anybody. He just ran with that shit. like I said this on the podcast, he watched them destroy rooms, like just howling, like a show on the show and that's what made me got into thinking like, wow, he is, he is a real comic, or here's an animal dude. that dude, I mean he might be 500 fucking pounds or whatever it is, but he's working. he's out there constantly huffing it. I heard he did like three hours shows too. Sometimes. It's just as ridiculous shows. I'm, I want to know is like stealing a lot of comedy, man. He's doing a constantly his feet, so his feet must hurt that they must have. They must just fucking anybody sits down after awhile.

Speaker 1:          01:20:46       Maybe it lays down and it maybe what he does this, the audience is, it's like one of those amusement park rides. They all strap in and they're raised them up over him so they're hanging from the ceiling and he's lying on his back and that's what he does is common. And what if he had a waterbed onstage and just laid back in a wider bed and there was this candles all around them. And then that's how, that's how I did his whole show. Cool fucking idea. How about just being in the tub? Just in the tub with candles comedy. Oh totally. That's actually not a bad idea. You had your opener in there with you and they're just hanging out laying there girls though. You only had one person who's funny. One person who lives you in that camp that thinks girls aren't funny. Most giRls are not fun comedy thing, right? Like there's a bunch mean sarah silvermans reallY funny. And so I shouldn't say most girls, just. Most comics are funny either. There's less girls doing comedy. So there's that funny

Speaker 6:          01:21:38       comedians that are women. I mean there's no asterisks. FunnY little esther. She's very funny. She's a good comic. There's a bunch that are really good comics. I'm gonna have a bunch of friends that are comics that are female. It's a joke. But uh, there's a lot of women that are terrible. It's a different to have different restrictions. They can't talk about as many things that can't leave. Sarah silverman does, but she's such a rarity, you know, most. But that's kind of what it takes, right? Like he looked at richard pryor sort of class to be you. It has to be you. And so very few women actually are that. I mean, sarah silverman, the reason, one of the reasons why she's so funny and so brash and dirty, it's like that's what's funny to her, that's who she really is. And it has to really be you.

Speaker 6:          01:22:14       And there's, you know, for doing an act. Yeah, for a lot of men that's always meant men. Ninety percent of all men talk about, you know, a lot of the same situations and you know that you can relate to anyone even if they're on stage, unless they're like as extreme as like say joey diaz and until he deals, we'll take it into the average man really has no. But for most women, you know, like conversations like men don't want to hear you talk about politics. Men don't want to hear your opinions. Men don't want to hear you talking about you getting laid and then don't want to hear you talking about like, what the fuck is this bitch so limited. They're limited. And they can't be the alpha, they can't be the one who has this idea that maybe everybody should listen to because it makes sense.

Speaker 6:          01:22:52       You can't be that person. The last thing any fucking asshole man wants to do as being the audience with some woman's smarter than him. That's making a lot of sense. it's saying some shit that he should have thought up on his own because look, controlling that. Good luck that. Yeah. And good luck with politics. Know. And then I'll always oppose women on political issues. I know a lot of men who, when women think one way, they'll think the other way, just because a woman thinks that way. It's just like, you know, it's just natural. It's ingrained. It's ingrained to not want a woman to control you.

Speaker 4:          01:23:17       So. So many comedians just rely upon the whole lake. Marriage sucks, like unhappy american male type thing. Then it's just, it's sad.

Speaker 6:          01:23:25       Well, You know what it is. It's like, first of all, that is a lot of what they are. I mean, a lot of people, especially if you're shitty at relationships, you don't know what I mean. You're most. We know a lot of people that are fucking terrible relationships. yeah. It is what it is. And it's also, it's, you know, they, they get programmed into thinking that that's what's funny. You know, That this is, this is the angle was what everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:23:44       The whole like, oh my life sucks like that. So that's the way it is. And I, I feel sympathy for you.

Speaker 6:          01:23:49       Yeah. But some people will come out with it and you know, you know, it's real, you know, it's like two people can talk about the same subjects and why it works and the other one that doesn't. And the one that works, it works because the shit is coming from a real place. That's like the most important thing. I think any kind of art, it's got to come from a real place to order to really resonate with people. This has to actually be what you want to do.

Speaker 4:          01:24:11       You and I started watching, uh, for about five seconds on cable. The other night was pauly shore is dead. Did you enjoy it now? I wonder why. That's where anything was growing up as a teenager. We would watch that shit like we would watch movies. Yeah. Well pauly shore of Then is not the polisher of. No, no. Fair enough. Life moves on and he's still a go. Do you go while you worked at the comedy store still or no?

Speaker 6:          01:24:36       Never. Never. Never. No, no, no. That's the main reason why that whole, uh, carlsbad ca thing. That was the end of it for me. Yeah. I don't want to bring up a little. It was just gross. I mostly do the improv now and other clubs, but

Speaker 4:          01:24:49       you're all right buddy. What is brian's moving around? Down the butter dog was fucking dog. Wait, what? I miss walking around with his dog. We get a suitcase for it. We're in the middle of a podcaSt. he's dazzled perth and just walk around. You get a dog now? Yeah, I've got a couple dogs. Well, you know my story about when I was living in Colorado, my dog had eaten by mountain lion, but he told me that. Yeah. So I have two left. I got a master's when I have a bulldog. Your master, a buck 40. Jesus. I'm buck 50. He's big, he's super friendly though. Just dog. The bigger the dog, the nicer they are. The media there. Are there more little shits? Well, there's some big dogs that are scary though, like pressing scenarios, you know, there's, there's some, there's some giant dogs that are fucking dangerous that usually the masters and the danes are cool, right?

Speaker 4:          01:25:33       Yeah. Great. Danes are also really confident. They're really friendly, but mastiffs like this dog is the best. He's just got the perfect personality. So she's so sweet to everybody. It's just a nice. I can't do the little dog thing man and know how you do it. Well, the little dogs, the one that got eaten and I had a cool little dog man. He was a pomeranian and american eskimos. Fluffy dog, but he got jacked by mountain lion. Did he just vanish one day or do you come crawling halfway? Like this story that we've told many times

Speaker 6:          01:26:00       I, I saw the mountain lion was having, you know, having little dogs lIke that. It's like, you know, they really can't protect themselves from anything. Foxes can jack. Um, we, you know, I saw a fox with the little baby deer. I didn't know, like everybody was talking about how fox is or like sweet. Oh they're so cool. Look at the fantasy five too. Then I saw a fox dragging a font and I was like, oh, this is real shit. You ever actually get to be around into the big katzman? Well I saw this one mountain lion that was in my yard and it was about 60 pounds, 70 pounds. It was like a dog, like a german shepherd size wasn't big. Like, like, holy shit, this is going to eat me. It was big, like, whoa, that's a mountain lion. It was like, it was almost kinda like more shocking that it was smaller because then I knew it was real. you know what I'm saying? Like I expected if you're going to see a mountain lion, I must, he a full grown mountain lion walking through the woods and something about the small one. And I was like, whoa. Like there's small ones too. Like how many of them are out there? I started thinking like, how many of these fucking creatures will live in the woods and just kill it.

Speaker 5:          01:26:59       I had a cat killed by a economy. I think it was a coyote, one of my mom's place and tIme. And you hear them at night, right? You just hear all the howling start kicking in, right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:27:06       Yard sometimes or they used to be. I had a fixed my yard so they couldn't get in, but they would, uh, they would get in and they would ship all over the place. They would shit over by my pool. And it was creepy man, because I stay up late dude. Yeah. I'm up til like 4:00 in the morning. so while I'm writing, you know, these fucking monsters are wandering around my yard. Look over shift.

Speaker 5:          01:27:25       Yeah. But if you're out there, they probably the you there and they do avoid it. Right. You know? Yeah. But, you know, don't, don't fucking take a chance with a small person if there's no one around. Dude, I chance people before I, uh, I had a chance to take my brother and my little, a seven year old niece at the san diego zoo or the wild animal park and kind of go behind the scenes to check out the whole sheet set up there and uh, there's one sheet of there that was hand raised, my brother and I got a and like pet the fucking thing. Right. And just hearing that it sounds like it, like a harley davidson right in person and you see this the first actually really course and they have a certain presence about them just like I don't fuck with me.

Speaker 5:          01:27:55       Right. And I'm at that point I'm like, okay, I'll go and I'll get my photo op and I'm gonna get the hell out because I don't want to have my face eat and like that bad in that lady a while ago. right. And then there was another one that's just pacing the cage, the cage. And when she saw my little niece, she stopped immediately made eye contact and my niece could sense that this creature like looked at her and want her to eat her and just like completely brand behind my brother's legs. Right. Because the cheated just saw her as food. Right. It's just that primal instinct just kicked in. Yeah. They can't help it. Cheetahs can be domesticated. They're one of the few animals that, that you can successfully domestIcate them or they're actually in the low end of the cat food chain in africa too, right?

Speaker 5:          01:28:25       Is that what it is? They're actually somewhat majored. Yeah. Yeah. And people have actually kept them as pets and trained them and shit. I guess they don't kill you dude. I mean a few animals. I'm still not going to trust it. Right. Yeah. I was a smart move, especially with your nice man. So she wasn't allowed in with them. Of course. Right. I mean even, you know, having it aware that that's food, if you know it overseas or again, it was funny to realize is it right? And they didn't realize it was. It was a magic moments are like, all right, this is something that. Right. That's

Speaker 6:          01:28:56       some scary shit dude. Big cats of the scariest. They say that the reason why we have scared where people afraid of monsters

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       like every kid is. So I'll just leftover dna from monkeys getting jacked yet. But cats back when we were, you know, subhuman, hominoid parental instinct to avoid scary stuff, man. Right. And like if there's an old Stephen King thing line, I can't remember what it was from where he was saying, you know, the lightening crashes and the door opens and you see a 40 foot bug, they are part of you is happy because you're expecting 60 foot bug. Right? Like thAt's why alien worked, right? Because you don't see the full alien right at the beginning you see the little bit of the leg, a little bit of the tail and you're imagining like what could this thing possibly look like? And yeah, it was the most screwed up. Awesome hr giger design like ever. but at the same tIme in your head, it was still out there. We already watched aliens recently is good. But the problem with aliens is that they established an alien that this thing is super fucking intelligent, really fast, gigantic, super resourceful, very crafty and sneaky. But then the second one, they're just shooting them left and right. And they're dying.

Speaker 4:          01:29:57       They needed one. You know, it was one daily versus the truckers to. They went too quick. They should have had less aliens. Let's look who the fuck of mine. Movie designer telling them one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. IT's still an amazing movie. But to me I was like, wait a minute. You can just kill them that easy. everyone's just running around shotgun. I knew better than one. One is an exercise in action. One is an exercise in suspense, right? One is the tease of the leg. The other ones the full on blown out porno, right? Yeah. And if you ever watched a rewatch the things to shoot scenes in the second one, like when she was battling it with the exoskeleton on, I was like, why isn't it just stabbing you in the heart? It's got this giant fucking monster tale.

Speaker 4:          01:30:33       Why isn't it just scooping you out of your camera and sat down and he's like, I want to see a fucking mac versus an alien. there's a certain point in creativity, man, where you have to be like, you know what? A gun with a chainsaw. It makes absolutely no sense on it. Like even look at the design. If you went to grab the gun, you saw your finger off. RighT? But it's cool. Yeah, but what I'm talking about is cut the shit moments. I'm the suspension of disbelief where you make me go in a place where I think you got lazy or you did. So why are you making me go here? Why? Why is this your conclusion? What? How? How's this bitch fight in the city? All they had to do is build a certain amount of, but they had make it believable. You gotta you gotta, you gotta.

Speaker 4:          01:31:06       I can't like have to go. Oh well I guess it's just really bad with its tail today. That's the same argument that says the lord of the rings. why didn't they just grabbed those birds at the end of it and have them fly over and drop the ring into the volcano? Right. Like there's always. It's always possible to find words. Don't listen to you fucking ryan. The birds at the end of the movie, man, carrier pigeon trust birds, birds, birds are all former dinosaurs. That became something new. That's evil bird ever is the african grey, the most evil bird you ever see a shoe bill. Now there's a Congo documentary from the bbc that freaked me out once because he was five foot tall, prehistoric fucking bird with his giant bill. That jacks these fish. It's fascinating, man. The thing that fascinates me most about birds, because they really are dinosaurs, they really are. You know, they, they think that a lot of. There's a lot of theories that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers that, you know, they just wrote it off and then we don't see

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       the fossils of feathers. Yeah. The fossils were just placed there to test our faith. Dude. Dude, that I argue with on twitter all day. I don't argue with them all day, but I read his shit all day. What is your threshold for blocking people? Oh, I just there if they're annoying. I just. I don't. I just go on instinct. If you're annoying me, I just blocked it. I love it when their dicks. Yeah. It's just so easy. It's a little bit. I read a thing for you. Do you get a block block?

Speaker 7:          01:32:23       I always quote that old comedy, but you did about the disproportionate amount of racial interracial porn being sold in the south. Right? It's like, dude, like if you hate me that obviously there's something that I fucked up with my team and the game that we did something wrong. Like how can I flip this to turn you into somebody who likes what we do? It's just one switch away. Maybe it's a, it's a reply saying, hey man, sorry. The matchmaking sucked in gears too. We've been working on fixing it like something like that to win you over and if you do then you could wind up with a fan for life. Right? You would have to go back and

Speaker 6:          01:32:51       time and stop that bus driver from fucking them in the ass and and roofie in them and given them moonshine. You'd have to do that and maybe why they're angry, whether mom didn't love them or maybe it's just.

Speaker 7:          01:33:03       Yeah, it was it. The 36 inch lcd testicles that the internet provides people, right? Once you have an amenity, suddenly they get giant ball,

Speaker 6:          01:33:11       right? There's that, but why are they angry at something? You know? Don't take a healthy, happy, super cool person who watches a game. it doesn't really like it. It goes into tax you on a personal basis. There's, they're coming from a deep anger of depression, peps. It's, it's a lot of different things, man. It's your life not being what you wanted it to be. Unfilled expectations were all around you. There's people like paris, hilton and kim kardashians that are multimillionaires driving around a bentleys and they do nothing, and your dry going crazy and so you attack and so you lose your game is for faggots. You Read shit. I hope you die in a fire. You know, like, whoa,

Speaker 7:          01:33:47       we're in the era of the art of the bed celebrity man. You don't have to be famous for anything. You could just be famous for being famous. You know what it isn't. So it wasn't angelina, the blonde. He always used to have billboards. Yeah, I'm going to pee, but go into. It's the continuation of that, right? I mean, it's just like, oh, you know, you just want to be famous. So you are right. It amazes me right now. How many celebrities can bounce back from like doing anything right now because America just loves a comeback story, right? You look at like charlie sheen, remember everyone forgets. Kim kardashians had a hardcore sex tape out there. You're like, dude, really? Like in their little girls out there that are looking up to her right now. I had a buddy of mine recently who, uh, actually finally, I'm sure this happens in la all the time, but he found it ex-girlfriend actually in a random porn video online.

Speaker 7:          01:34:27       No way. It's got to be. I want it to happen one day. I want to be able to just go sell my feelings. Right. And it's, it's one of those things like if you sit there, like I say, like porn is like on the internet, it's like a, a mandelbrot fractal. he just keeps going and going and you could just keep the. And it's never ending. Like when we were growing up it was like asia carrera and like a ginger lynn and then like jamison and then janet and I was like the same 15 actors just repeated with different spoofs of movies. Right now it's like you can just go on there and it's like an amount of girls and you're like, at what point are you like, all right, so this is a thousand dollars. I don't think anybody's ever going to see this. And his reaction, man, it felt so bad for him.

Speaker 7:          01:35:04       And of course I teased them like nobody's business, but I was like, dude, you're getting your, like you're chasing amy type of a, a girl next door type moment. Right? Like if he was just kind of crestfallen about it, they didn't even go out that long. right. But the fact that, you know, at some point he found this girl cool thing hung out and then he finds a video over on some random internet site doing some bad cheerleader porn and it was just like, just coming back, who is this? You're talking to a buddy of mine in town. You see peopLe in a, in la, I'm sure it's a common thing to like, you know, data girl, then find out later she's a porn girl where she's done stuff like that, but you don't see it that often. And, and, and outside of that. And I had a friend of mine recently happened to and imagining the mix of feelings.

Speaker 7:          01:35:40       He came like, like of comedy of crestfallen. I'm like, I'm, I'm like, dude, did you, did you, did you, did you rub one out to it? And he wouldn't, he wouldn't admit to it, but the feeling he would have of the lottery just saying to brian about the chasing amy slash girl next door type vibe. Right? Or just like, oh man, it's kinda funny. I blame joe frances. Hey, what's going on with the gears of war movie? They're stiLl making that you guys still make for the sirens. Goodbye. I'm optimist. Still working on it. I learned a lot about how a filmmaking and how hollywood never end the business works, right? I mean, you really realized that it is very much

Speaker 6:          01:36:14       business. It's annoying as fuck, right? There's so many people with so many different opinions and you gotta listen to all of them.

Speaker 7:          01:36:19       Well, and it's, it's, there are people who just don't mind, don't even have an opinion, but in order to stay relevant they throw their near here.

Speaker 6:          01:36:24       I'm only hearing that on one side, one side to see test, test. Oh, you know what? I think it reconnected. I think it's just the base. Sorry. So, um,

Speaker 7:          01:36:34       what happens is it's a business like any other business, right? And people want to make money and often the people who make the decisions are often very rear with looking like, well, I'm looking at the last two years and according to this, movies with monkeys and them do well. So you need a monkey. And I'm not saying that's my personal experience. Exactly what it is. Yeah. I'm not sure this project, but what happened was they had a. They were like, okay, why don't do this big, you know, he got, you know, len wiseman attached. He great guy, amazing director. Okay, well great. Well you know, we have a really good script. You know, we think we can knock this out. They looked at the budget like okay, so this is $120,000,000 estimated and there's no real love story in here. It's got it. It's got to be rated r because the, you know, if I show up at comicon and we have a clip that doesn't have people getting cut in half and blood flying everywhere, they're going to tear us limb from limb and then there is no little kid jayden smith type story and they're like, this just doesn't add up like the assistant head.

Speaker 7:          01:37:24       All the demographics. And I remember reading a storY about these guys who kind of created a computer formula for it where you can literally plug in the genre. You could plug in the actors. You flipped the time of year it, russell, release the various themes that are in it and they could, you know, vegas type betting odds, you could bet on whether or not their production would actually make money and they, they make money doing this. Right. And you're at the point where I'm sleeping, right? Yeah. And it's, it's. And they're saying, well we won't get the matrix that we will get the 300 out of it, but we'll get some sort of will ferrell comedy that where he's got to where you're doing a wacky sport, right? And you get to the point where creativity, it goes to die in that environment

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       and for, you know, now everybody wants to make a district nine, right? Than like how can we make something that only costs 60, $60,000,000 and then blows it out because everybody's conscious about how much money they spend. Basic economics, right? So, I mean, we're kinda redoubling of doing something that's a little bit smaller, you know, recycling the script projects. Not dead man, but uh, you know, doing it with live people a tbd bad. I mean, a lot of it depends on who gets attached as a director, things like that. I mean, I personally would like to see live action as little cg as possible. I would like cgi people. Man. You know why your people don't look real. These motherfuckers, they're giant heads. What are going to get brock lesnar to play every role? dude and dudes look like fake dude. There's not a lot.

Speaker 5:          01:38:34       Not a lot of thick neck guys like that that have that level of charisma to hold up on over there. A two going to work. You gotta go cgi son that he gets some little voices. Yeah, geek dudes who are crazy like they're getting closer with that, but duty they carried. The guys don't have to be that jack dude like, but your guys are so jacked and gears of war. Everyone's jack. That's part of the cool thing aBout dIesel to your average person in pitch black looks jacked and he's five foot two and was maybe what like five to. He's a lot bigger than that. When I've seen him, he was short maybe. I think he's six feet tall. He's friends with rigo rodriguez who used to be ufc heavyweight champion. I met a metal maybe in a bad angle, way bigger than seems short.

Speaker 5:          01:39:15       When I saw a man, well, I'm short, but he's bigger than me, but the bottom line is, dude, it's more about charisma then is about muscles. You get sliced charismatic. Look at the hawk that you can't have a lou ferrigno doing the hulk in 2010. We want that big fucking crazy cgi. Crazy hog that fucking smashes down. There's a huge. There's a huge delta between markets. Phoenix at the hulk. His fists are his biggest pickup. How head is this big compared to his body? Marcus phoenix is jack, but he's not like insanely jack. He's not even as jackson guy. The cubs were muscle and fitness magazine. Yeah, he is. He's just as jacked and his head's extra super wide because he's a double alpha. The armors part part of it, dude, but it's fucking head is giant. These perfect dude. I fuck around man. Listen, dude, get some super duper fucking cgi peps on this shit.

Speaker 5:          01:39:59       Why? You can do anything man. Monsters and everything. It all exists. You can save a world. That's insane. Do that for 60 million, but was it too expensive, dude? Do you know much avatar cost? I mean it was insane how much they cost 200 million plus trod cost. One hundred 50 million. Here's a better idea that you're in game footage. Movies like in, in your video game are so good. You should have like sItcoms with those guys going home after work, like having a, having a relationship with the fucking king and queens, queens. We're just get some dads home. It takes 20 minutes, take off his armor of god, do it in game footage and stuff. I've got like a sitcom with all your characters in it and they're all like family guy style. They're all friends and they hang out and get drunk. It was a terrible movie, but it was a game, right? It's a terrible movie. But it was an interesting concept. There was a Bruce Willis movie. Uh, we're uh, I think it was called surrogate surrogate's. Yeah. It was really recent. Yeah. Where everybody wide uptake. They, they, they stayed at home and then they had the younger version of that all exist in the

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       world. The younger perfect version, you have this full head of hair and perfect skin. It was like kind of weird. I don't know. Cgi had him somehow, but uh, you're getting at the point where they can Kind of track your body and then kind of cgi over in such an amazing way. Right. And I mean, you look at what they're there for tron that are recreated. Kind of like jeff was saYing, it looks a little bit more like gary oldman. Then Jeff Bridges. Yeah. There's look at all the posters for that. I'm dying to see the film and I think Jeff Bridges to me, I thought it was pretty cool. Jeff bridges gets cooler looking the older he gets. Have you seen the trailer for trigger it? Seen him naked. It looks awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:41:30       Talking about his face that he looks so just drizzled, right? He just loses it. Doesn't know where the fuck. Think sagging and it was just bleed. It's got skin tags breaking left and right and he's got, you see the trailer for true grit though. Yes. I crazy heart too. That was good. yeah. That was an interesting movie man. It was kind of cool. I like sad. Right. But dude was sad but it was good. I mean it was The life lesson of being on the road that much. Right. In the loneliness. Right. It's also the party in men, you know, I've, I've met a million people that have problems with partying, with alcohol especially, but with coke and with a bunch of different things, they just, people that are performers are performing all the time and they need to get up to perform and that's the respect I have.

Speaker 4:          01:42:15       Like I've, I've, I've done like the european press tour for the games where it's five european cities in five days and that just wrecks me. Right. I cannot imagine doing like 30 cities in 40 days. Right. Like what it takes to actually pull that off and to sit there and to show up every night and to command a stadium. Like what does that, what does that do to you? Right? Like how can you actually show up like that? Right. And then at the end of every night there's an infinite amount of partying or just the girls lined up to just do whatever. Right? Like at different city and new people experience, you all think you're gone. You really have to get Back to your hotel because you got to get up in the morning and five hours ago to your flight. That's, those are the ones who are responsible, right?

Speaker 4:          01:42:46       Yeah. Well it's all the. The reality is those, uh, those tour, like I only did one tour like that most of the time what I do with comedy as I go out on the weekends and then I come home, I go out and go out for a couple of days, then I come home. But a lot of guys will go out and they'll do like, you know, like I know why mazda brawny we're talking about and he goes out and he goes out for like a couple of weeks, three, four weeks. But one time we did this maximum tour and we were gone for like a month. Yeah, like a whole month of just constantly doing gigs and it's a fucking weird thing, man. It's not how many cities? I think we did 22 to 22 and three days. Do you have like a comedy bus or both?

Speaker 4:          01:43:22       We took a bus some places. Most of the time we flew, but it was a. It was a brutal man. Weird. Everyday. What'd you. All you're doing is Traveling and then trying to get as much rest as possible and getting onstage and then trying to get as much rest as possible. And traveling. You never get a full night's sleep. You're always flying. You're always eating terrible food. It's interesting. Even though it was fun. Your comedy gets tight. She loved awake. Did she left the waking up and going? Where the fuck am I? All the time. Yeah. I still did that. I do that so often because I travel so much. Like, oh, get up to pee and I'll go, okay, where's this bathroom? Where do you know my trick? Leave the bathroom light on, close the door. Oh, that's a good. Because when you don't know where the hell you are and your, your, your hey, you got to go like you.

Speaker 4:          01:43:59       That thing will be like this. God you motherfucker, you. But I've had that happen and there's a worse feeling in the world. you want to. Weird thing, man. It's a hotel room. You just pee on the floor. And joe had like a scare at a hotel where we both thought we were going to die and we've talked about it before, but that really changed the whole thing for hotels. For me, I actually fear hotel to hotel rooms. We'll check. I'll always look out the like somebody knocks at the door, always look out the little law. The people and fire. Yeah, wasn't it? You know what the problem was? It was in an old hotel. It wouldn't have been nearly as much of a problem, but there was a single file staircase and we were on the fifth. I was on the 15th. What floor were you on?

Speaker 4:          01:44:37       I was on the 14th I think. And um, you know, and you could only get one person on the staircase at the time and people were slow as fuck. You feel that you have, you probably felt that like people are about to trample each other like at that threshold, right? Where there's just that instinct kicks in. I was like, that kiddIng. I'm the head of the pack. I was the one who will be running on people's heads. I was seconds away from sprinting through these fucking people with slippers on, man. All ambient. You can tell they were fucked up from sleeping pills and shit. And they were moving slow as shit. And the problem is the announcement like the lady on the things like please evacuate a building. The building of fire has been detected. Please evacuate the building immediately. And what time did that happen?

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       Like three in the morning, 4:30, 4:30. and especially not knowing where the hell you are. You know, it's like a robot voice that woke us up at dan chen. But it wasn't, it was a woman. There was a woman talking because while she was talking she was doing it. so robotic, we were trying to, it was, first of all, we're so foggy and we're trying to figure out why, why, you know, if this is really happening, it doesn't seem like how you would tell me that the fucking buildings on fire. Exactly. So this, this, uh, fire has been detected in the building. Please evacuate immediately and I'm not sure if this portal, I don't know if it's a robot or if it's a real perSon at the building until I hear in the background, we got to get these people outta here. Shut them. There was a guy in the back behind her that must, must've been like, you know, behind the counter with her.

Speaker 4:          01:45:59       It's like we gotta get these people out of here and then it was just a false alarm and he's just decided to fuck with everybody. Like, no, no, no, it's on the twelfth floor now we need to get him out. I remember thinking that I was the same exact thing as joke because we had talked about it afterwards and I was thinking the same thing. Like I am going to have to start throwing people out of my way. And then I looked at the windows like in the stairways that was like off the, it just, it's just amazing how slow people can actually physically move. Like, like that plane that landed on the hudson a couple of years ago. Like I would've just crapped my pants. I'm like, get me off of thiS. Right? So how many people do, are barely taking care of their body?

Speaker 4:          01:46:34       Barely. Barely, barely. Next to that guy on the plane. It gives you the extra elbow rest. Yeah. When it's leaking over under your seat. And we were thinking about that when we were, we had ralphie on the podcast. He means brian and he barely sat in an account together. Mean what happens if you're on southwest and you got to sit next to him to say it. It's all about the lap band now. Yeah. What the fuck is this dude? It's everywhere. It's on every billboard there. so gluttonous that, you know, you know, there was a picture from a long time ago, the beginning of the, uh, the 18th century or the 19th century, there was like a carnival and they had the fat man in the carnival sideshow free spirited woman, the fat man and the fat man wasn't nearly as big as ralphie may.

Speaker 4:          01:47:15       This guy was a freak back then we'll do what because people had a fucking work and move around that it's moving. But it's also the average american diet, the average american diet like three flavors, fat, sugar and salt that everywhere you're trained, we have an entire generation of kids that will not eat food without ketchup on it. Like they just won't. They just have to catch up and catch up. Chicken fingers and it's like, do, heaven forbid you take them out and I'll give him some fish or try curry or something. Like just, oh no, it's just. And then you don't think about mcdonald's. Get them young. Right? Yeah. Well the thing is about like this lap band thing is what's really creepy about is all you're doing is making the stomach smaller. So that you get full quicker, so all you have to do is just stop eating so much.

Speaker 4:          01:47:55       But it's not, it's that simple. It's, it's hitting your dopamine receptors and you've been trained for that and that's the only thing, you know, we, we talk about, you know, can you just try and get half portion please? Like it's huge now. Right? Right. But when you're filling up and you have this lap band thing, so you have this tiny baby fake stomach now and that little fake stomach filling up. Do you, does your doberman receptors go off? Do you get the chemicals that sale it? Dude, it's on every billboard and apparently the surgery is not invasive enough that it's the point it's going to be like you've watched people get the lap band installed in the mall, like laser eye surgery. Right? Like I do that dental. Why'd they get your lap band while you're at it? Right. You know, it. Isn't it like a shitty fix to a problem.

Speaker 4:          01:48:32       That's obviously a lifestyle and diet problems. Somebody saw profit. Right? And yeah, I mean that's true. I mean obviously like the shake weight. Yeah. Well, what's so weird though is like when you talk to somebody that's like insanely obese, I know he's drunk, she's drunk, sled, don't do that. I'm drinking a bottle. She licks, he's used to list looking cylindrical things in your home, but it's like you talked to these people and they're always like, I don't even know what the problem is. It's fibroids. This is that. I'm on a diet. But then you hear the other stories were like, no dude, he went to jack in the box and pretty much ordered like 13. I honestly think it's the same thing as the guy who just works out to the point where it looks like he's just comedic. I think it's, it's an addiction.

Speaker 4:          01:49:14       I honestly think it is. Yeah, I guess so. But that's a little more. That's a different kind of totally different kinds of craziness. The crazy, the fat craziness is just like they're just trying to die or something. You know, like I have a friend who I know has like a massive food addiction and just anytime he's around fast food, he just, he can't drive by a jacket. Oh yes. He's going to go in and you're trained at a young age to enjoy those flavors. also mad and it's, it's a stealth calorie thing also. I mean, he knows he's fat. He's on talks about it. He's trying to do things and never has done anything and you know, if you know in your head that you should stop doing this and you have a problem, it's very strange that you can't rewire your brain to recognize that like, oh, this is something I'm aware of now.

Speaker 4:          01:49:57       Now I just need to stop. It's a. Once people get set on a certain path, then at a certain point they just go, right, right. Breaking that cycle is the hardest thing. Right? But why does that exist? The big question is why is that in our system? Why is it, is it the same thing that allows us to get obsessed with things and get really good at things? Is it like a bastardization? How do we all know what borders are now? My grandpa was a hoarder when she died. My, uh, my uncle wound up having to clean out her place. I remember as a kid going to visit her and she would have stacks of national geographic five feet high with her goat paths. We'd have to navigate. You go to the bathroom to pee in her bathtub. Was used to have bags of clothes in it.

Speaker 4:          01:50:31       She'd never really. We always wondering why grandma smelled sweaty and you know, she wouldn't. Didn't wear deodorant, joe, but my grandmother was the same way. Your, your grandmother didn't wear deodorant up? Clearly? Not. Why not? Maybe she just didn't think it was okay to plug up her armpits with stuff. I'm interested to wear deodorant. I just don't wear antiperspirant. One thing is just smell. Just giving shit, man. Stopping the. My grandmother was completely crazy. My grandmother when she died was exactly the same thing. They had a. They had a clean out her. My uncle. I think it's a control thing when you give her much borders. Yes. Usually the husband obsession husbands, some train wreck and the. Something's gone south, so it's this one thing that they can. They can control and in their life, right. It may be, but she was insane about a bunch of different things, but the whole house was just stacks of boxes and no one knew anything and it's never anything valuable.

Speaker 4:          01:51:15       It's usually just little. She had a lot of money that she didn't even probably know she had like $30,000 was stored in the house, some some ridiculous number and they were broke and it was really because she had grown up in the recession and when you grew up in the recession, you're like constantly worried you're going to run out of money, can stash our parents, and our grandparents were always like, no, you're going to finish that. You're going to take that home. And now this current generation is like, eh, screw it. I don't need it. Right. She had an aneurysm and she forgot where everything was. So she had all these fucking cans around the house and nobody found until she died. So it was like 12 years. She. Yeah. They gave her 72 hours to live. She had a massive aneurysm and nobody found it for a long time.

Speaker 4:          01:51:49       I came outside and she was just jacked and so, uh, they uh, they brought her into the hospital and then they're like, you know, maybe she's got 72 hours. Maybe she lived 12 years. Wow. 12 sicilian peasant genes, bro. Diehard right. Karen rocks up hills for generation after generation. Josh ortega, he wrote a gears to had one point where he was an apartment manager department and he got a phone call that this person had the strange fluid like that. They assumed it was a sewer leak above the rest. Something like the dead person. Yeah. Yeah. He called it. He called him like it was a cop or some sort of cleaner guy. Touch it, smell. It was like you got death above you. The guy got had died and bloated and actually soaked through. Oh boy. And he, once they took the body out, josh actually had to clean all that out. You can't clean the ceiling. You have to cut it out, suck through. The smell does not go away. Or the wallboard leaking through the wall board. You've got a body and your ceiling. Would you live somewhere like a place that somebody had been

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       murdered at? No. You wouldn't? No, I don't think I would. And you know, one of the reasons why I don't think I would is I really honestly believed that there's something to the. I think it was rupert sheldrake, who's a evolutionary biologist, had this idea that everything has some sort of a memory. I believe it was his idea that memory doesn't just exist in the human mind, but that objects and things have memory and the world around you. that's one reason why you can come into certain buildings and creepy shit has happened there and you know, people are fucking flakes, man. People tell you they can read their paul, your palm or I sent you a good person. There's a lot of weirdos that talk crazy spiritual talk, but there's California, there's for sure, right. Everybody out here wants to be special without working for it, but for sure there's something about feelings.

Speaker 5:          01:53:30       You know, there's some, some, there's some fields that you get for some places and so many people have had like gone into a house where someone's been murdered and no one even has to tell them and they feel terrible about the house and the house has a nice house. There's been so many stories about something like that. The wallpaper is murder somebody in there. Dude, you know what? I think ghosts aren't just. There aren't just potentially these things that exist around here. I think it's like a memory, right? As far as uh, there's this awesome game system shock two. Do you ever play it? Yeah. And they used to, they basically had these implants that allowed you to see the memories that people right before they died and he come up with, come up with. IT was a great storytelling thing because a ghost, he couldn't interfere with the cuts.

Speaker 5:          01:54:06       He couldn't shoot the guy before he did the thing. You just saw the last like eight seconds of his life play out and he came up the elevator shaft and this guy in front of you who's standing there with a shotgun, he was like, I'm sorry, you know this, the space station has gone to hell. I can't deal with this. You know, lee and the kids forgive me and he, you see him put the gun in his mouth and it phases out. Well, they use that throughout. Right as an amazing storytelling technique. Right. It's classic stuff, man. Right. He brought it back to gaming right there. Did you see the mario kart started that with the. Goes around the track that. Yeah, exactly. That was you compete against yourself, right? Yeah, exactly, dude. And now we're all figuring out how to basically have different types of events happen online.

Speaker 5:          01:54:43       You know, like angry birds. You were saying now they're doing like the holiday edition. Right. But they're handling it right to man. Those, those people didn't charge anything for that game and then they've been updating it and you know, patching it. I wouldn't be if I finished angry birds and then there was a screen to come up. It came up and said, hey, you could have 30 more levels for 30 bucks. That would have been like, yes, yes, and my first born please. They're treating it right though and I mean they make money, they get it, they sold the game. They're giving a lot away for free right now, but they weren't you just saying that they have some like ninety nine cent like eagle that'll take out the whole level for you that they've been. They've been planning what they have that and they also had like the halloween pack and then they also have the whole new christmas pack.

Speaker 5:          01:55:21       No, you can't just play all the levels. it's an advent calendar sooner. You can only play one level on each day so you can't just burn through them all in one night, but it's such a well designed game that you're just going to keep coming back. Right? Totally. So simple. Perfect kind of ios game, just doo doo doo doo doot. Definitely tablets, swipe baby. that's the way to go. Everything's turning into applications. To have you notice, notice that nowadays you're not paying money for like a magazines, you're not paying money for, for this and that you're now having applications and apps. Apps are just fancy programs, right? That are just smaller, well maintained. The personal. You're taking these apps with you on the road. A loT of people are concerned with on the internet right now that like, it's no longer as a series of linked websites.

Speaker 5:          01:56:03       It's huge. It's facebook, it's various kind of silos of information where it's all self contained within that. Right. The thing that, you know, again, I like facebook, I think it's cool. You know, I like stalking people. I went to high school with. It's cool at the same time, like the fact that every website I go to now has like a facebook integrated now, right? We're like, I don't necessarily want somebody knowing I go to one website and accidentally click like broadcast because, uh, you know, any comments, you can make comments on these a lot. Oh, absolutely. And you do it through your facebook log into your facebook. I'm like, wait a minute, where's my password going? How do you know what's going on? I'll never forget you connecting. I'm allowing you to connect through my facebook. So here's a question for you. If you. If you could have perfect memory, like day to day, you will remember everything when you were 10 years old every single day, but it had advertising in it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:52       Let you do it know it already did. Dude, that's fascinating. That's a very good question. So like I want to go from August 4th, 19, 74, 3:00 PM. They're like, okay, this is sponsored by gecko who go to [inaudible] dot com and you're like, fine, fine, whatever. Then you're like, bam. Now you have that day in front of you on video of course, because we're all living in their memories. Right? Or that thought. At least you would definitely. But then you would say, well, where's the store? Does this nonlocal? No, no, no, no. It's like divek circuit city. Yeah, that's the thing. There's a story on. I'll pull up this shit on my own. They were able to surgically kind of removes certain memories for mice. They've started to come through. Some of that is technology like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, so if you're a ptsd sufferer and you have traumatic events that Afghanistan, they can surgically remove the stuff that happened to you so that you can move on.

Speaker 5:          01:57:39       Since there's some dude that you fucking hate in Afghanistan all sudden you're in New York and he sees you like, yo, fuck, and you're like, I don't even know this dude. That's not cool. Yeah, this guy would hate you and he'd be following you around. You're like, what is this dude's deal? Or you get out, get out of a bad relationship and you're killed. Everyone he knows when and he made me make the iron man outfit, right? Yeah. You get out of bad relationship and meanwhile she still remembers you and she's fucking sharp in an upward daggers. She was like traveling over the trailer behind the condom can break to get you arrested for. She's got all sorts of outfits. She's like blade and shit. She's got a trench coat filled with weapons looking to take you out. Blissfully unaware of the fact that they're starting to make these breakthroughs. Right? There's a breakthrough in nanotechnology that happened, I think it was about a year ago where they were able to figure out how to actually have a cells that were bonded in an injection that would actually then melts a, a, a tumor that was a tumorous growth like without any sort of radiation treatment or anything like that. Right. It's just, it's right in the fridge right now, right. Like hAve so many diseases and everything like that, like it might actually happen within our lifetimes and forget about your kids. It's not just

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       happening in, in technology, it's happening in space. Like all the shit that they're finding out about space as well.

Speaker 7:          01:58:48       Are you following any of the astronauts on the international space station on twitter? Know there's that guy dig up. His name is, uh, he's been just tweeting photos of like amazing, like, like sun sunsets from, from space, from the space station. like somehow they hooked up, you know, he's an internet connection up there and he has like $300. twitter. He's like, hey, look at this, this his name's, um, I guess that you sound not gucci. It's a astro underscore, soi. Chi has got 300,000 followers and he's like, hey look, we're taking off and to go to the space station and he's just got this following and like these making space travel. Cool again. Right. Whereas you know, you joke about kids who want to be mma fighters, video game designers. Now this guy's doing that for the job. Right. Which I think is really cool when he.

Speaker 6:          01:59:33       Yeah, I actually do follow that guy. I have seen some of his cool stuff. I forgot. I think also many people are forgot.

Speaker 7:          01:59:38       They compile it on the huffington post once in a while you just look at it just to go through just like, this is amazing. There's so many things that are just so crazy that are unmissed not even understood about this world. The whole lake arsenic based life form stuff they came up with.

Speaker 6:          01:59:48       I know what they found out that that was bad science. Really? Yeah. That was very poorly written and that nasa nasa rushed to try to get this press conference or this press release out there before it got reviewed by all the right people and there's a ton of criticism all over the internet that what they did was they drew some really unscientific conclusions and and kind of a. It's not, it's not. It's not disproven completely, but it's not proven either. It's a, it's not ready yet and it's kind of like contact where they're not really sure if jodie foster really went to the other world, some nutty shit going on. Man. Have you heard about this new object that they found outside of pluto? That's jupiter sized really just out of nowhere way the fuck out there, like probably as far or more from jupiter as we are from jupiter or excuse me, from pluto rather as we are from pluto and it's outside of pluto and it's gigantic.

Speaker 6:          02:00:40       They don't know what it is. They have no idea where it is exactly, but they know there's something out there. They're pretty sure. I knOw you've probably talked about this in the area because you're big on aliens to. The whole idea with Stephen hawking was saying like, no, if aliens actually find us first, then it's going to be a situation where were the native americans and then it's everybody else coming over from europe. It didn't turn out very well. or were monkeys were not even native americans. Man, native americans released human, you know? I mean if something is a million years more advanced than us, it's going to be like us collecting bugs. LIke again, like I said, your kids are probably going to live to be 150 plus to see this. If not, if not you. Who knows? Man, who knows what the fuck is going on, the breakthroughs that they're coming in to live to 1:50 working in video games. Would you stress? Yeah. Maybe we'll just kick back and go jay z style. Once you compile all your money, dude, dude, dude, because the developers, the people who have the money or the people that put up the money and those are the people that make all the money's at what's going on and that it's much harder for the developers to go jz style.

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       It is. Yeah. You get. WeLl, you get to the point where it's. It's so hard for one person to really break out and do his own thing, especially in the triple a space because you're seeing where it used games and rentals are eating up so much of the market that for somebody to spend, you know, millions millions of dollars to make a game and that to actually launch it with all the marketing is a huge risk. And then so a lot of people are turning to mobile that running to all these different kinds of places. Right? But I would think that at a certain level, like your level, when you have a certain reputation behind you, that it might be easier for a bunch of people to come to you and say, listen man, you're a proven commodity. Why don't you get your team and you know, we'll give you guys a cut of the publishing hypothetical.

Speaker 7:          02:02:16       I knew what he did an early age that by doing the pr and being able to have a little bit of a theater background and go on stage and this stuff would get me a certain amount of leverage and then by working with talented people, making great games, I have built a brand for myself. So hypothetically I could probably go knock on a lot of publishers toward to mom and be like, just give me a bunch of money. Let me build a team, do whatever I want. The problem is epic takes good care of me and I worked with everybody and I get to do the shit I want and I know I've got a great setup, so why fuck with it for something that may or may not work out. Right. That explosion was brian fucking around in the background. What do you think that the world's coming to an end.

Speaker 7:          02:02:47       What do you think the current, a lifespan of the consoles are? Leg until the new year? We have for the first time ever in video games, we've just gotten past the five year lifecycle. Yeah. It seems reason yet is I think for a lot of people graphics or quote good enough. Yeah. Right, and like what if, if you were to put something new on tv, that's what is the current state of the art versus the latest playstation. Xbox game would've passed the mom test, which your mom look at that and go, that looks amazing. Compare to that. Maybe. Maybe not give it a couple of years. Yes. Right. So right now maybe it's good enough. You know, you have all the emotion controls and everything like that. They can kind of keep everybody occupied. What do you think the next thing is? What do you think is just going to be faster and bigger?

Speaker 7:          02:03:24       Or do you think there's going to be the personally. Yeah, my personal opinion, personal opinion, fastest hell, avatar style graphics, avatar level of graphics, something that is always connected to the internet. Is it ever going to come to a time where that's easier to do than it is now? What? In regards to building the log, building it, creating it, I mean there's things like that will, there's ways that you can procedurally create content, right? Like we'll write it spore where like a lot of the textures were automatically created so we figured out what like a, an algorithm would be for grass and wood and things like that and there's a huge, not huge, but there's a subset of people that are working that technology like, okay, just hit a button and just generate 50 types of wood for me so we don't actually have to build it.

Speaker 7:          02:04:02       Right. Then you get to the point where there's a certain library of do I really need to remodel the couch for the 8000000000th time? Like work smarter, not harder, right? Figure out ways to use more modular architecture. Do you really need 50 columns of different types of. You can just spit them all out, right? The key is going to be figuring out, you know, like how to craft that within a certain financial model. That's the billion dollar question. How do you put that aaa content. That makes sense, right? Like hoW do you remain profitable? Will there eventually you think will be software that makes it easy? Like the average person can create games. That's what we do. That's half of our business. You could go to utk.com and download the same exact stuff we used to build our games for free so anybody can for free, go and take your technology and make their own game.

Speaker 7:          02:04:42       They can. The problem is of course if you start making money with it, then you have to talk to us about officially licensing it. Oh, that's pretty funny actually, but the reason why, the reason why the smart is because you have so many college campuses out there that want to find a solution. How do we train college kids to learn how to use this technology that goes to it? Is it how hard your builder to builder or killed for these tools? When I was 13? Yes. Now they're not making games hard. Right? Like you still have to know what to do, but if I was myself, 17, I would've been able to do such crazy shit. Like I had to learn visual basic and get a programmer. You're the programmer. I did jazz jack rabbit with back in the day is the guy who works in kill zone now. It's just one of those weird like, you know, professor x mag needle type situations. Right? But he's cool guy, great dutch dude. Um, but yeah, like you can just go download it out and start building games. So I get these kids a tweet all the time. How do we get the business? How do we get the business? I'm like, go to utk, download it and start building something, figure out what you're good at and work your ass off and be better than everybody else. I've been playing that hard shaft. I mean

Speaker 1:          02:05:39       mineshaft game that's on the slip there. Brian king called big black dog, king kong and it was great. It's minecraft, right? Uh, so have you been playing that at all? I heard they think it's the first pc game I paid money for and years. Really? All right. So we got through this whole episode without anybody talking about big bucks. That was a horrible slip. It was like one of those big black dicks though. It's almost like it's impossible. It's like it's embedded into our system. We track dick talk, we've through the black car and so mine shaft, how do I. Okay, I'm going to go from people at cox to minecraft, minecraft game. joe, this kid, this kid, this kid decided to make this game out of it, out of

Speaker 7:          02:06:24       his garage. And he's making god I hipaa, I don't even know the numbers. He's making money hand over fist, right? And it's basically a world where you can, you, you initially start off and you can build cubes at different, uh, materials in front of you and then build anything you want basically. So imagine building three d pixels and there's people who have built like the earth in this game, right? Right. And then there's this mode where the nighttime comes and you have to eventually figure out how to survive your first night and start building like a workbench and built all these different things. And it starts getting deeper and deeper. I haven't gotten too deep into it, but it's become this kind of phenomenon. He's talking to valve about doing something with it and what you see right now is these kind of little micro developers who are having success.

Speaker 7:          02:07:00       Right. The guy who did brave jonathan blow, you have the team who made portal was like a handful of kids who made an independent game that then they started working with valve. Right. The guy who did the limbo, the team into the limbo. They were at the independent games festival. We saw that and were like, this game is great, and then every time I'd love supporting these indie kids because you never know like what's going to come out of them because they can often take risks that we can't because you know, in their garage and they're, you know, bill, would it be for someone to make a movie with your game engine? Pretty easy. Real, yeah. Wow. Yeah. They call it machinima. Oh yeah. Mastermind. I'm going to the award ceremony where they call it spelled. I always call it

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       [inaudible], but I don't know the art of, of readmission. Machinima. It's the art of a virtual camera, right? That's a c, h I, m a s, s, s, l I t dot. I've seen some old ones done with old game engines that looked really hokey. That was good, but the game engines of today, they're so sophisticated. That was what red vs blue was, right? That was that whole web series that became huge. These guys, little characters and they just made them target these incredibly funny situations. You need to have a sitcom of your character's having wives and stuff in that forum. We will absolutely do that in our spare time. No, no. He just hired two speed iphone efforts and high school kids to do it. Yeah, but the marine guys pulling their assholes apart and the goats, he posed no beauty of so many of those internet memes.

Speaker 4:          02:08:25       Just I could sit there eating a giant bowl of cereal, just watch it and not even care because it's been sent to you so many times. Right. That's true, and that's the other thing. You know, we were talking about kids getting freaked out by all the input that they have today. They're just going to get desensitized a little quicker than us. If you can handle it, the kids can handle it. Just gonna be trickier, trickier in the beginning. But I will tell you bringing it full circle, like every time I see real life, like, you know, violence in front of you see somebody get hit at a bar. It makes me nauseous. My problem is I'm so used to it. I see people get beat up and it's so normal. My wife cut her head and she opened up the back of her car, you know, the hood and banged her head on it.

Speaker 4:          02:09:02       She accidentally the skull but bled. No, it wasn't that bad, but it started bleeding because I talked about this already. No, it started bleeding and um, I just looked at a cut for her. I was like this traumatic thing and I'm like, they're not even gonna stop this fight. This is nothing to tap on this. This is ridiculous. This is barely cut. Like there's only one inpatient wounds bleed a lot and I'm like thinking shit, I might have to take her to the hospital for this little baby cut. And she's gonna freak out if she gonna let me stick like crazy glue in there and glue it together because that's what I would do. Those my head. I'd be like, just drop some crazy shit, man. Crying you. Pansy cuts when you get cut, they put crazy glue on it and push it together with the little one gets put some vinegar on.

Speaker 4:          02:09:40       My point is I'm so used to trauma, I'm so used to like dudes getting punched in the face and you have that kind of fighting, bringing constantly do. And again it comes back to boston once there's that, but there's also working for the ufc for over a thousand fights being three feet away from these murderers, these fucking trained killers punting each other in their head. You know what I mean? I've seen so many dudes just get fucking flatlined. What's, what's. What's the lifespan of a fighter with the amount of head damage? Everything, right? It's a good question. I don't think we know. I'm not saying lifespan. I'm saying as far as like how long can you actually fight before it starts to come in? Have you seen, have you seen that it becomes like a visible issue, like you start to see things get a little off? I have seen guys go from being absolutely normal to absolutely not normal, absolutely normal to frightening. I've seen that. I've seen the full spectrum. That's very shocking and I've seen also also guys like randy coture who get out of it with not a, not a single problem, you know, and randy is so super lucid, you know, you talked to

Speaker 6:          02:10:34       him, he's very intelligent, very aware and you know, and he's been, he's been knocked out a couple of times. He's recognized how to build the brand though, right? Well it's also, he's a smart guy. He doesn't take unnecessary punishment. Some guys, they try to be more exciting so they'll take unnecessary punishment. They'll, they'll, they won't fight strategically. They'll fight like in an aggressive style and an attempt to overwhelm this person with their physicality. And when you do that, you know, it makes for an exciting fight for the fans, but it's very dangerous for you. It's very danger for your long term mental health. That's a management issue. You'd assume that demIng fighters have their managers who kind of advise them on these impossible. You can't tell a guy what to do. There's no way he's going to not going to listen to you. If he's.

Speaker 6:          02:11:11       The guy wears his underwear when he gets in that fucking cage and they shut that door. He's not gonna. Listen, yeah. Fighters will take. They'll take direction as far as coaching. They'll take direction as far as technique. They'll take direction as far as, you know, they have a guy that they really trust and he raises them correctly and trains have to be a good fighter. They'll go out there with a healthy respect for the art form and they'll go out there and do it right. But if you get a guy and he just. That's how he developed. He developed like this is a style, and then he tried to coach him. It's like, you know, good luck. The new tricks that will you mean. So to see some fighters and all they want to do is brawl and they brought every fight and then you see other fighters were.

Speaker 6:          02:11:44       They skillfully avoid strikes. Take the guy down, strangle them. You never see. Very rarely I should say. I wouldn't say never. He never. He very rarely see someone go from being the meathead brawler to being the super intelligent, ultra skilled technician to get through a fight and takes no damn. Imagine you want to be surgical about it, right? You should. Yeah. Well you should treat it like what it is. It's a martial art and it's a game and the game is due punishment without getting punishment done to you. Be superIor in every single aspect of the game. Be able to force your will on that person. Yeah. That's the intelligent part about it. But you know, you know, it's also when you get fight of the night bonuses and you know, you want to make the crowd cheer and you know and get that adrenaline.

Speaker 6:          02:12:23       Yeah. Yeah. And a lot of guys, you know, they love to say they finished fights, they go out there and they put it on the line and it does make for more exciting fight. That's, that's absolutely true. But I had this exact conversation with a guy named john donner, who's is a pretty infamous jujitsu instructor, really super, super smart guy, and he and I both agreed that the most important thing is, even though it's good to be exciting as a fighter, it's good to, you know, it's good to please the crowd and it makes the sport more popular and everything. I absolutely agree with that too, but the most important thing is to be very skilled and to be the most skilled and do the exact right thing that you're supposed to be doing in order to apply damage, but take little return. And when you take unnecessary risks and you do something in an unsmart manner, you're degrading your art.

Speaker 6:          02:13:11       You're, you're, you're watering down your purpose. You're, you're, you're doing something that's not the optimal way to do it. It's not the artistic way to do it. You're not, you're not fighting it correctly. You know, it's like riding a wave, you know, when you get off that way, what do you want to do? You want to face plant into the rocks. Of course not. No, you want to, you want to ride that bitch and be perfect. That's the way that I can't. I can't speak on them. And it's just, it's a world that said so

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       alien. Yeah. I would say it's alien to me and I've done martial arts my whole life, but I've never fought in the ufc, you know, and being around over at least a thousand fights, you know? Yeah. But we were talking about like guys like being used to trauma. I'm way too used to trauma. So normal for me. I've been at bars with dudes are beating the fuck out of each other. I'm like, yeah, these guys hit each other. Keep your hands up, dude. A fucking pussy. That's the irony, right? Is like, you know, when we do these games these days for your pet as guys and they just need a terrine arms off beat people to death of it and like you see anything in real life and it's just like, jesus, I get seven getting sick. Right. Well that's a good question man. So like, what do you think about this whole debate that, you know, this, this, I think it's pretty silly and kind of like not, not well thought out, this idea that violent games make people violent.

Speaker 4:          02:14:19       I don't think that's true. I think whatever happened to crazy first and foremost, right? It's a chris rock's kind of think about it. I honestly think it's a situation that they, they relieve more stress than they cause. LIke it's a cathartic thing. Like if there's a certain type of mind that's drawn to a certain type of entertainment that was just predisposed to that, right? Yeah. And that person's sick period. Yeah. So you're not going to get violent games. Was hitler playing? Right, that kind of thing. Right. And it's just like, dude, I mean, right. We cannot create a society based upon the lowest common denominator of entertainment. Thank you. Write like a or anything or anything. There's, there's entertainment for kids, it's entertainment for adults and that's the way the world works. I mean it should be that way with everything. Access to information, you know, propaganda you can't, you can't like program society for the lowest common denominator.

Speaker 4:          02:15:07       What you're doing, if you're, if you're not allowing intelligent people, we're not going to be effective if you're trying to restrict their access to things like video games and I personally think the market will bear what the market will bear, right? Like you look at what we do with a styliZed violence of these big giant guys and space armor. Ripping the arms of lizard men. If there's a game about a guy on flatbush avenue with the yankees hat pulling off the arm of somebody else with the red sox hat and it was depicted real lake, it be kind of like, eh, but then the violence in grand theft auto on the other hand plays very well because it's done within the context of the story or it's done comedically where you're running over a hooker or something like that. Right? It's all people. If people are willing to say that, okay, but, but what if the government steps in?

Speaker 4:          02:15:47       I mean, there's been many times where there's been talk about legislating what the content of video games and making sure that there's rules what you can and can't do. They're already rose though. That's the thIng. that's what people forget is the fact that this rating, so if there's a rating system, there's a parental restrictions on the consoles which are very easy to set and there's also the fact that the games costs a certain amount of money in order to get access to. There's multiple gateways there that are in place and on top of all of that there is of course the parenting issue, but is there the situation like there is with movies where they tell you, hey, you can't release this unless you cut out a bunch of shit or it's going to be like x ray. It is reviewed, right? It is viewed videos nc 17 or something that you can get an adults only rating, but it's the. It's a kiss of death

Speaker 8:          02:16:30       much like the nc 17. Whereas you know you're not going to be in walmart. You're going to. You're not going to be in mass effect. Isn't that at walmart mass effect or whatever? The one with the prostitution, the add and that was massive effect. Did have some sex type question it, but there was, I don't know about. I don't think it was prostitution in any mention of amazing that you can have chain saws and the end of your gun where you can cut people in half, but you can't fuck. Well, that's America. that's amazing.

Speaker 6:          02:19:45       okay. Okay. Okay. I think or something like that. Alright. Alright, we're back. Anyway, it's rough being this cat. we're going to have to split this up.
