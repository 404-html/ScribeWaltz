Speaker 1:          00:00:05       I was packing in the Poconos. We live more. We're now and the great boss and the dynamic duo of pride fighting championships back in the day, classic fights. You guys are attached to some of the greatest fights of all time. We are used to tell him every time a single fight to say because at the time were 6 billion people. I go, hey, understand too. In 6 billion people just did the government dating for this show because we love that shows at all to this man. Mr. Rogen, Bas rutten in many ways saved my life. Oh, it's getting dark early. Yeah, I thought we're going to go down a half. Nope. Mara, when Allah wants immediately go down to a bus route and saved my life. No, no, no. Let's keep it positive because, uh, my two worlds collided on my very first event in pride at Bushido.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       One October fifth, 2003, a pro wrestler dose Scottish junior member of the guy in the mask and the act to. They have to actually cut out even bigger. I to Vegas Fighting Miracle Cro, cop one. And can you imagine a mission in North America would never allow that and yet went in. Boom. Did you see the recent one with Gary Garcia? The rising English Kennedy. I just saw like, you know, like, like a, like a repeat thing, like a little loop thing. But she fought and I don't know, I don't know if she was sitting to Bressler whatever she was. She was hobbled. She couldn't walk. Her knees were totally wrapped up. She was limping from the moment she got in there. This scanning Garcia's towering over this old lady. She just beats. She swallowed it. I mean it was just a giant Silva taking a two by four against Takeshi Secura.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Remember big giant Silva two by four. It was like hit him with at the end of the. The angle. Yeah. On the pride fighting championship event. Why did he do that? It was, uh, again, the, the marriage of pro wrestling and, and pride in many ways the, the larger than life storylines and production could lead to things like that. And we sought firsthand the freak fights if you. It wasn't, I mean it wasn't a part of the actual fight. The fight itself was there, but you remember allister used to bring the, the, the. There were pro wrestling esque entrances, which. Right, but a lot of people loved. But was this a part of his entrance? This was finding somebody? Yeah, this was after the fight. We remember Takeshi cigarette in giant silver right there, and it was like, yeah, he had the Dubai for choreographed. It was, I think it was. It was maybe a part of the presentation and not something that, like you say, he wanted to assault someone with a few fights for in the early days that you were like, oh, okay. That's a fixed fight, right? There's a few. Oh Alicia, did you

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       remember it? It was the funniest thing ever. A Coleman was fighting to Catia. Yeah. They told me there was going to be a. He was going to get finished at six minutes by way of heel hook, so now the press comes to me and he tells me what do you think's going to happen in his fight, and so it's easy to go. Who's going to win six minutes? He'll hook. Everybody froze because this was before the fight. So they had to change their whole gimmick. What they were going to do. I went to one and a half minutes now, but I just thought you future pride result. They had it all planned out. They hold up, uh, you know, everything with Takata would say, well actually I can extend those course. Yeah, that was. Yeah, that was 100 percent that, you know, Takata came into our studio training at the Beverly Hills Jujitsu Club. We had white and blue belts a tapping him. So it was not like this guy was. Well, he was just an old time dance. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       They wanted to. Again, that's, you know, you talk about how pride fighting championships at Genesys, it was that, you know, bringing the biggest, the so-called toughest best pro wrestler against Hixon Gracie, the, the mythic, a falling Tuto Jujitsu fighter. The UFC had a similar but more rational approach to it recently with cm punk versus making gall. He said, well, we'll give this cm punk guy a kid with one fight, one amateur fight. I think he had at least one amateur fight and one fight in the UFC show. It's promise choked guy out. And we said, okay, you're going to get a tough kit. You're gonna get a tough kid, but [inaudible] going to have to fight a real fighter, but you know, you're not going to fight Hixon gracie. You know what I mean? It was just at that time, nobody had Jujitsu like Hickson. It's just, he was just so above and beyond everything.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       Yeah. Unreal. So will be $400. No, no, that's a nice round number that they always got to wonder who threw that out first like they did. Everyone's such a disservice. Three 98. That sounds way more believable than perfect. $400. What's crazy is when you see these tie fighters who literally do have hundred fights at 20 years old. Yeah. And fight you got instead of sits on [inaudible] who's a, the lightweight champion on Gloria. You in fact, uh, many years ago in Canada doing Moitai on, uh, on Tsn, uh, the espn equivalent up there. Same thing when you brought in the tie fighters. They, but they were, as you know, Joe, and there's a good documentary, shameless plug, showtime. It's going to be showing a documentary about a fighting in Thailand. Didn't moit time where these kids literally, that's how they survive, right? You start at eight and nine years old and you're on your way to hopefully making enough to eat.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       Did you get a new documentary that we're doing right now? There are people in jail like murderous. They get a chance to fight themselves for a pardon. Oh my. That's a new show is going to start looking at weekend. Maybe the documentary as that Red Devil. Oh, what's his name? The rat suit. The guy with the horn, with the horns. Cut Off. Famous. A famous actor talking that actor.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       Oh, he's also into the gang. God dammit. He's narrating it Jamie. You know it is. The dude is a star of hellboy. I got the documentary is called five rounds to freedom as well, but it's narrated by head. Pull up, pull up the page, the page on it, whatever it is. Yeah. Freedom. Ron. You Go, wow. That's crazy. So what are their crimes that they're going to be one guy that he stabbed somebody in the neck and I go, Nigeria, what petty crime? I go, okay, I can understand it, but it wouldn't bring. Criminal State sponsored rehabilitation program, popular known as prison fight is not reserved for petty criminals under the law. Violent criminals and crew, including those convicted of murder. Hold on a second piece of this is the one who was convicted of murder and sexual assault had been freed and in some cases fully absolved of their crimes through their participation in prison fights. Well, that sounds crazy, Arizona. My birthday. That's even crazier than that. Anybody would allow this thought you have to do if you're a violent criminal is prove that you're more violent than the other violent criminals and you get your freedom. That's fucking insane. Yeah. I don't think there's a lesson to be learned for them. Results on one point. Oh yeah. Ken, violent men redeemed themselves through violent acts. That's ridiculous. Of course, they think probably a pleasant placenta plus becomes a negative. Maybe they think that way.

Speaker 3:          00:07:26       Your sister or your daughter or your mom and then they get out because they beat the fuck out of all the other 100 percent agree. If you see the trailer, that's what a woman says. He stabbed his kid in the neck, killed a kid, and now his guys going to fight for his life to get out of there. You see, it shouldn't be. No, shouldn't be losing. So, uh, back to the $400, no most likely not the dl number in anybody's case, somebody just made that up for propaganda purposes. If they would've said over 400 but just below 400. See, but making it for. And I love that his son is super active now and I love the crone is fighting like really top guys now you know, he's he fuck with Jerry in his last fight. It's a tough fucking Chi. That's a tough area. I will always wonder what happened to crossly Gracie. Remember, strike. That's the thing. He seemed to be the first Gracie to me to take it to the next level. Become more well rounded and well versed and whip. Done well. I think Haji showed really great promise until King Mo knocked him out. Right. You know, that was a big knockout. King Mo can crack. We've got some serious power. He's a tremendous athlete. Student striking as well. Huge boxing fan. I'll never forget that ground and pound Kale that he had with Seth Pinsky.

Speaker 3:          00:08:44       Scary guy. God. Yeah. But that the throw the guard to the side and drop that right hand on you like, oh my God. It's a. well in Henderson. I

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       mean it's amazing. Uh, some at the time I'm, you remember, I mean he just a Ninja that was one shot and I told him to do to everybody. He is the guy that when he has a, you know, when he has a face as a great striker and I tell them, just take them down. I saw him, he took me down. I mean you is freaking animal. Like in training. My Focus Mitts and my hands would hurt after I would hold him and he would stand on one leg and hit. I don't have no clue how he generated that kind of force, but he had so much power and I said it, just take him down. Scott Smith, why would you even go with them? The guys is trying to just take them down, knock them out on the ground, and he didn't do it. Every time at the end of the round, he did it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:36       Hit him one time it was almost dazed. The belt went around again, but the third run the loader compelling career for Scott Smith to right. Hadn't headlining events on CBS major network exposure. I remember what we called the Christmas miracle when he came back and knocked down calmly and, and again, the guy who's I think back working, uh, uh, what you know has a steel back in the factory and you, it's interesting all the sporting, such a short period of time. Of course we've seen the explosion, but what could have been even in, in with a, with a [inaudible]. And we saw what happened with kimball, but it's just interesting for me now as we reminisce about stuff, how, how so many organizations had opportunities and yet fell by the wayside for, for one reason or another, a lot of it's self inflicted. Well, elitist

Speaker 5:          00:10:22       c was a really hard one to watch because it was bastardizing the sport you were seeing, they were standing people up like, do you remember what number that 15 second rule was? But it was also they were standing up and dominant positions like Roy Nelson and Arlovski kind of incredulous working for Kamora and they stood them up but like, whoa, that's crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:10:43       But then you can understand why those Kimbo slice, you know, taking what was necessary to bring it was the first organization to make it to two major network tv. And I think there were some decent fighters along the way as well. Where you Akimbo fan at all in terms I know your, your martial arts and that's why I respected sit here, bowing down at the altar of the erudite one. But did you like what Kimbo slice represented at the time?

Speaker 5:          00:11:09       I think to most sites was a tough guy and he was a fun guy to watch, but the reality of what he represented as a mixed martial arts fighter at that time was he was, he was fairly novice. Yes. He didn't really have a ground game and he really couldn't stop a good wrestler from taking him down, but he was a good puncher who was really good in those backyard, brought in those environments, you know, like he was tough for the 99 percent of the guys out there and he would smash guys and he smashed a few guys in mma. Yeah. And you know what I really respect about Kimbo said he went on the ultimate fighter and he gave a go of it can mean he really does make the. Yeah, it was already a huge youtube star at the time. So he went on with all these other unknown unknown guys who are wrestlers and football players and guys like Roy Nelson and he handled it like a fucking man. Big Target. That is a big

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       target on his back. Everybody knew him. Everybody wants to fight him. And the numbers were through the roof when he was on and he was a great guy. Yeah, he was always a super friendly, real, real nice guy. Always cool with everybody up. Despite his appearance as he looked like blue, the gold teeth, crazy beer and left. We had so much fun with that guy. Good guy. Yeah, exactly. And that's why though it seems, because I think there's the argument continues even now in the sport. Right? What with a rankings, right? Joe? How come Damien Maia is not getting the next shot at you? Tyron Woodley. Well, keep the money. Fight. Not fight that Woodley and wonderboy. Half to read 100 percent draw. I agree 100 percent, but then I also think dominick Cruz in and cody Garbrandt as much as what a masterpiece. But if you look at the backgrounds and what's happened with in the past, I think dominick Cruz also deserves a rematch.

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that because I don't think that was that close. I think cody clearly won that fight. Green. One thing. Cody represents what? The body of work that he's done in the shore. Yeah, I mean he, Tj dillashaw, he was an amazing fighter, but tj has been waiting for a long time. Tj barely lost a fight with dominick was a razor close decision that could've gone either way and then he goes on to be half our sun sal and I just feel like in his position now and then he beat, you know, the, the, um, lended Linacre shut her down and that's when there's no exact science, I guess is what I'm saying in it comes to, to matchmaking and putting together championship fights and what do you market the freak, the star, the dominant fighter. That's why I love the sport.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       Yeah. While there's certainly arguments either way. I mean there's an interesting triangle between the three of those guys. I mean there's a lot of good match ups that can be made with those guys. And then also there's Dodson, you know, Doug don't ever sleep on Dotson. Dotson might've lost to Linacre, but I think Dodson when he's on is one of the fastest guys in the division just glued. I always say, do the math, the weight jumps like a freaking spider almost. It doesn't slip. It's really weird. And if he catches you, man, that finishes. I mean he's a guy hasn't wait. Thunderbolt. Yeah, exactly. Lighter, you know, like say the luck of base camp pop. Well Cody Garbrandt, Dotson, others are showing. Even Demetrius Johnson seems to have, again, pound for pound, one of the greats. Right. One of my favorite fighters ever. I think he's becoming more, not necessarily more aggressive, but there's, there's some finish now to, to his game as well.

Speaker 3:          00:14:24       He's always been trying to show you guys, but you know, you find a guy like Ali back off. Yes. You know, it's a tough fucking guy talked to finish those guys. Let me think about who he finished. He finished Moraga, finished her Gucci with one second to go, you know what I mean? He's a fucking animals Max out. Benevidez punch the shit out of pseudo stops one route. That's where really I was like, wow, this uh, you know, it's. But that's, I'm hoping like we've seen with boxing, but uh, the, the, the UFC fan base mma fan base begins to rally around these lighter weight classes because to me that's a, that's mixed martial arts, uh, at its best. I always want the WEC, that wasn't my favorite show because these guys had full gas tanks. Now nowadays everybody has it. But at the time were only the lightweights, lightweights, and that's why I love that show.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       And then when you see butted up like, hey, more power to them. Actually. Fair, smart. I think cody garbrandt has a real possibility. Becoming a huge mainstream star was a handsome guy. He's a devastating puncher. Amen. Vicious striker. He's charismatic, he's confident, he's very, he's very moral and ethical. You know, it. A relationship with that young boy that had leukemia and to help them through it. And I mean, it's like intense, intense shit man. I mean, he's a special guy and that was, it wasn't leukemia is. I mean, he's a special guy. Stop Shop, man. I, I, like I said, we just mentioned the podcast. It's like, um, it was almost like he was holding back and he said, okay, I'm going to pull it out. Once I've fought fight for the title, that's when I really got to show what I can do because he looked like a completely different fighter.

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       He was always good, but this was a whole. But the way he dominated dominick Cruz mentally especially leading up to the fight where it appeared that he had gotten, you know, Cruz had gotten under his skin when he stormed out of the interview, done. But from the opening bell, like you say, the, the, the, the taunting and stuff, and yet able to back it up and, and show whether it's evolution or whether it was already there. A masterful performance man grew up in tough environments. And I think that what he said after the fight, when I asked him about it, like, what does the taunting that didn't bother you? No, I love that stuff. It's like I'm used to that. Like, you know, that was one where he's comfortable in. Well, he was also able to stay real calm in that world championship spotlight that's very, very mature.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       Plus you flipped it around, you know, he, he shows crews that he doesn't want to go into this battle, almost like walking off. But then once the fight started, he started doing it to Cruz and I think it got to curse, you know, pointing at the ground, doing the little dance moves. Guts, credit, cruise for the way he handled the. Yeah. But man, like a man not as good as anybody. Tim Kennedy's another one handled it as good as anybody. Yeah. Some guys handled it. Mcgregor handled as good as anybody. He beat me. That's it. Know that's a, that's as, as admirable, you know, as I'm putting out the correct game plan and winning. You know what I mean? There's something incredibly admirable about a guy who can take a loss like a man or a woman, you know? I mean anyone who can just accept what happened and that's just what it is. You know? It's a very unfortunate when you see someone that's saying some things that don't really make sense like after a fight or blaming on other people or blaming it on their camp or blaming it on an injury and it's just an I, I think you, you did bring this up and I agree with you in terms of when someone has been knocked out or someone has been in a a very grueling, tough fight. I don't know why we are forced to interview them

Speaker 4:          00:17:53       myself to at times where I'm like, that's not right. I remember

Speaker 5:          00:17:58       interviewed Cro Cop after the Gonzaga fight when a Gonzaga head kicked him and he. I was asking him questions. He had no idea where he was. You could tell there was no one home. I mean he had just gotten completely flat lined and I'd said to them then I said, I don't, I really don't think we should interview people after knockout again, but I dropped it. We never talked about it again. And then after that one and I was like, that doesn't make any sense. So he was out cold and I'm

Speaker 4:          00:18:24       like you said Alex, obviously to where he has, you know, for whatever reason, thought what he did is he had a good. Yeah, he really didn't, not really close, but I. Yeah. And that's, you know, to uh, unfortunate that I don't see what it accomplished says anyway.

Speaker 5:          00:18:40       Yeah. It didn't make me feel bad too and I got to give them the opportunity and then I had to give them an opportunity again because you couldn't see it for the first time. So we had to watch it from another angle. The other angle reveal that it didn't happen. So it was kind of stuck, you know, that's not fair. It's not done, but it's also not fair. If someone tells you they had a good team, you got to

Speaker 4:          00:18:59       Whoa, 100, whatever. The fuck

Speaker 5:          00:19:03       crazy. We saw that he had the gifts and we saw Steve, Hey, do this. And we went,

Speaker 4:          00:19:06       oh no. What about the bat? My introduction to probably my very first show, Bushido one, our first fight, Chris Brennan, Asian Woods, Woca. I'm settling in, getting ready. I'm really excited working with boss. And immediately there's controversy. I'm Brendan had to in the arm bar, we saw him tap and right away the referee go, wait, what's happening? They, they actually restarted the fight and seconds later Brendan submits them with the Camorra. So right off the bat, a double submission. The Christian. Right, right. Yeah. I always a lot of great. How's he doing right now? Did you hear it? I haven't talked to

Speaker 5:          00:19:44       tune in a while. Last I saw him was at a UFC a couple of years back. He said Hi. And I know he was teaching them

Speaker 4:          00:19:50       Dallas, I think on social media. Every so often I see him. I think he's very successful instructor right now. He's a very good Jujitsu instructor on top of being a very good fighter. Yeah. No, no, that was A. Yeah. Well, it's so many. So many memories, man. Second rob all the way back. Old Doc double a double tap on, borrowed against us. Coordinate and Marilla. Busta Montay. Even our good friend John said that that was the biggest. You know, he owned up to it too, but that, you know, the guy doesn't make many mistakes, but that one I didn't know that he in the book regretted a greatly obviously. So. But uh, but yeah. Sorry. You were saying marilla. Bustamante yeah. In the UFC against God dammit. How the fuck am I not from team quest? Yes. We just talked about that the other day. Yup. Yeah, he got Matt Lindland an arm bar. Matt

Speaker 5:          00:20:45       millen tapped. He said he didn't tap. They restarted again

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       and then he got him in to get to you in the next round. Exactly. On top of the world, man. Well, it was such a great rivalry to backup private btt and um, and the shooter box man, it was to the point where they get old even walking by each other like, okay, wait a minute. What's going on here? Let's say it was so, uh, intense, very intense rivalry which made for some, uh, you know, legendary matchups when we're talking about the way here. It was giant. I mean, you, you, will, you guys, you guys represented like this wild west. No, it was just, it was, everything was crazy, you know, that's the thing, because there were also at the time, these were the best bet, but you're white whiting was also the mix of the what we already talked about, but we were talking on the way here.

Speaker 3:          00:21:34       Mauricio Shogun Hua. Remember 2:23 years old goes through Quentin rampage, Jackson, Antonio. Whoa. Jerry Nogueira, one of the best fights in pride history and then in one night Alistair overeem and record to win that Grand Prix. And you don't say what Jon Jones did at 23. God bless them, man. One of the best. But Mauricio Shogun Hua beast at that age, man. Oh yeah. I mean there was a lot of guys and it's almost like I would have loved to have seen what Nogueira in his prime would have been able to do in the UFC and I would've loved to seen what fate or in his prime because essentially when Nogueira fought fader door, he was in his prime. Yes. I mean it was that pre or post Bob Sapp. That was after. After he fought a sap at the national stadium. But the problem with that is anything post Bob Sapp, you have to take into consideration how much damage he took Bob's hats because he got beat the fuck that was dropped on his head due to compensating.

Speaker 3:          00:22:32       I go, hey, we got this first death right, was like optum headfirst and nice. Three hundred and 50 pounds. It's similar with the monster plex, right? Our dearly departed friend, Kevin Randleman. When fresh off of upsetting miracle puppy goes and drops off fatal. And again, fader, a million Neko let you say would have been very good to see what we had done in his prime because even despite being dropped on his head, calmly coolly regrouped and then submit randleman with the memorial about a minute and a half later. Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah. Fatal Aurion is prime. She's the one thing that was. I mean it's actually just interesting. It's cool to see those old videos and wash those old fights. But there's something about like epic matchups between great fighters, like did the opportunity of Cain Velasquez in his prime versus fade or in his prime. I would have loved to see. That would have been so for all these injuries. I would have loved to see that. Yup. Yup. Yeah. Who did it? Well, we didn't get to see miracle one fader, which at the time, I mean that was the most anticipated heavyweight fight in MMA history. Most amazing about that fight is fatal and beat him standing. That's why we. Exactly. He is the one

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       that adapted and beat miracle. What his most potent weapon. He's this guy that he. His striking, it looks not technical, but when he strikes it's perfect. There's no load up whatsoever. He holds his fistdale and from here it goes forward. You can tell when he shot is accurate. Is a member of the entry cost, but with Antonio Gigolo guarantee you the final. The tournament. But yeah, the way he would enter the garden. I think that's what Fabrizio Verdon did this homework, because remember they're doom almost bay. Well he did. He baited him when, when he submitted them and I think doom Shaka fight also right when it goes soka fought fader, a timer, the rematch and pride. Right? That he was throwing these bombs and I'm doing the commentating. I said, well, he's really overcommitting. He should watch out. He doesn't fall into a triangle choke. And then they brought that piece and it put it next to the piece.

Speaker 4:          00:24:41       Whitey Ford for doom you. That's exactly what happened. He was over committing and right away they slept on that triangle to, against tk though was ridiculous, right? The elbows. Uh, it was a rings though. There was a. That was an egregious error. It should not have been. I don't remember that. Yeah. The, that's why it should've. It should've been a victory for us there. No elbows. A lot of the grads. The man, when I think back now, the rule, I just, it seemed like there was no real rule, no ground and pound. Yes. And they also, again, it was, there was, you know, came from old wrestling and then into the rings you could hit to the body on the ground. Is that how it works? Clue. They, uh, feel like you couldn't hit to the ground. Weird rule on a promotion that introduced people to two people like fate or Antonio, Rodrigo Nogueira, Dan Henderson.

Speaker 4:          00:25:33       I mean, they all go babaloo. Sobrato rings, uh, produced a whole bunch of man. It was, I wish would have been nice to have over. Our friend joined us for some of those fights. I should have definitely made a trip over there just to watch, you know, because I was thinking of flying to see fade or fight against material man to ever make it over there. Oh No. Not this life, but I just, I feel like that's one of the things that I probably should have saw it pride in its prime. I always tell people out 90,000 seats. I remember Dana, he came for the first time, but it was the first row. And I remember when I look back, when the opening started, I looked back at east with his mouth open. He looks around to go. This is the craziest things. Parents. I remember looking at him. I go, right, this is crazy. I mean, it was insane. He brought chuck. You remember drover and Quinton rampage. Jackson five. Um, the but okay, well there you go though the, the, the UFC used to have the ramp and the elaborate entrances and I know they wanted to separate from my other light of employment, wwe and the wrestling aspect, but don't know Bella toward does a pretty decent job when their entrances and stuff. Do you think that that is something that

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       could help UFC now or is it or is it you like the boxing entrance that's pure, you know, the sport aspect of it. Because I think fans in Japan, man, I mean the production values were ridiculous and I think it was, it added to the experience while it's definitely a different thing, whether or not it's better. I don't know, man. I just like this, uh, past UFC with Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunez walking down the tunnel that I like just watching weather all those guys. Yeah, I agree. Give a fuck about fireworks. I'm not a little kid. Yeah, I want, I want to see what someone's face looks like. They're about to go to war. You know, when I went and watched the you, she, most of the time, you know, it's recorded. I turned my phone off and that's where I go fast forward. I go to the fights to pick something up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       When you then had to go like, oh man, that was like, I got, let's take a look at that. Do you know? So I'm a little bit of idea, but that's how it shows you how much I wonder in joy it Yoda, the video footage that they had, the pride fighting championships and especially the one would feed or woke up crying. That was a tree was amazing for sure. Like movie trailers for the fight. They'd show you the tea that the movie trailer and they were not allowed to show it to the American audience for some reason to add this. I don't know why they weren't allowed to show the movie trailer part of it. Nope. That was, that was Tokyo TV or wherever. Whoever had that contract, food, GTV, GTV and they get like 5 million bucks to show what was always weird for us when you're shows would either be like 4:00 in the morning, so we'd have.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       I'd have guys over my house at 4:00 in the morning. Everybody be drinking red bull, trying to stay awake and then pride would come on. Or you guys would have the fights and then it would air on tv a while later. Like later. Yeah. I tried to break it. I was calling all the windows and you know, to see what gambling if we could do something with that. But no, it didn't. Cubs win the world series and. But everybody knew the results, you know, because of all the websites. So you just watched to see what happened.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       I combat sports is the one. Forget football, baseball, hockey, everything else. I don't care if I know the result, I will watch a fight. Yeah. If I know the result, I'll watch a fight too. It's just, I think it's the, it's not as good. Meryl Streep? No, it's not as good, but it's still. I don't know. There's something maybe because it's more digestible size, but I just, I find fighting to be something, you know, I, I will watch other than if I record a, a hockey game and I know the score will and screw it. I'm not watching it. Yeah, man. I was reading some of the responses to Metal Meryl Streep. She's crying, just blasted for Olympic sports. That's what I said. Okay. What the comedian what, what in what context do you think she. My knee jerk reaction. Same thing. Hey, love me some murals street, but why do you have to trash at my mayor? I'm wondering if she didn't even ever know what mixed martial arts was. Someone gave her the word with arts in it and she made the time. Well, it's not even arts, but if football doesn't say football arts. Right. So let's see. Went after mixed martial arts because

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       she said the word arts and then she ripped it. Your right. She said, which by the way is not. They are like, okay, well what? What Arts, you know, it's not the art of pretending you're right. It's the art of execution under extreme circumstances. Very difficult circumstances, highly trained opponent, trying to smash bones in your face. Incredibly difficult to do advantage Rogan, right? It's artistic. You can't tell me. When Anderson Silva landed that front kick to veto Belfort's face and you see his legs given that's art, that's art. What about Joan and on Anderson Silva or Hook right into the heel hook. That was incredible. That was like a movie scene, man. Brazilian Jujitsu is art. A brutal piece of art. When Quentin, rampage Jackson Queer Carto Rona Slam. Oh my God, he arches backwards. Oh my God. It didn't. Someone actually call that shot a few seconds before you saw it coming.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       Believed in Christ to hold onto that yet, hold on gotTa, let go of that fucking thing. But then the replay. Don't. You did see this smash heads. He goes, well, but your wife, why did he hold on? Who's probably gone anyway? And even if the young smash heads up, the, uh, the impact was so brutal there a Ronan was essentially never the same again. No, no, we never really fought well again after that fight. And it was so much potential. But you know what's funny, we're talking again. Paolo filio another gun. Oh, he went crazy though. Did you see God? Good Garden. Was Sassy the evolution of him or what he's now doing right now, he's at the door of the top guys in [inaudible] 85. I like it. I need to say about a role now because I was interviewing a rohde and he had a cup of tea. Japanese green tea was standing here as somebody and it was so cool that he kept his cool. So good, pushed the thing, fell off and he's sitting and he does this and he comes up here at the cuff.

Speaker 6:          00:31:35       He grabbed this school because I know it is going to go. Just

Speaker 3:          00:31:44       not looking good. And he brings it back up and he sets it down. Man Jitsu Stud as was Paula Filio yeah. Paula was one of those guys. He got you on the ground, man. He was a fucking pitch. You'll do you remember? Uh, will you just call it a fight? We started the radio and Louisa, for me, uh, in Bushido want to say it was an to me the earliest example for me and probably one of the best grappling fights I'd ever seen in an mma arena member, Ricardo Arona and dean lister and their rematch from the Abu Dhabi and we were pumping the crap out of it. It wasn't, uh, wasn't the most fan friendly friend. Hey, let me ask you guys about this cobalt on my mind because I'm tired of talking. Thinking about grappling matches, what did you guys think about Aoki? How are you? Okay. He used to wear those tights and uh, you know, when he went to fight in us, they wouldn't let him wear the tights. Eddie Bravo and I have talked about this a million, like

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       I don't see a problem with him wearing the tights. Like why does he get the sweat? It has more traction. But girls can wear like rash guard tops. Right? Can they cover their arms? Can girls cover their arms? I don't know. I don't know. No, they should not be allowed to do that. I don't wonder why. Okay. So why do you think he should have been allowed to have fun? But yeah, when I watched Aoki fighting got to rap dudes up. But it's crazy legs. The tax, the tax man. George Grid gels. ACL. Yes. Yes. I'll go roll on your knees. You Yoakim Hanson. You wish you Manson when the walk off. There's another guy that I wonder why it never came to the UFC when he apparently didn't want like, you know when the UFC bought pride, they had the contracts. He apparently didn't want to come over.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       Right. He also has been a ton of war man. And you know, he's, I think he just fought again. That's what I read. Or retired by boy from Norway, right? Maybe in Europe. But remember what he was. He was powerful. I remember he was one of the few guys that can actually hurt you from a back position. So one guy, a Russian one time who knocked somebody out to a, mounted him, really laid on his back and he a big swing and he wins the fight. He knocks the guy out. The guy had mounted him event where it said that Duane Ludwig broke his orbital bone when Dwayne was on his back. Dwayne swung up and crack even the eyeball and broke his little hole from the bottom. That which he did the coolest thing. What I always wanted to do. When did you know at the Bartow?

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       Yeah, I think that's important stance on one leg and then go do that. I'm telling my students about this, that you can do this, but never did it. Right. That's an old man. He was a part he and train a little bit with me as well and actually had that great fight on seeing here. Let's see it here. There you go. Beautiful. Even with talented, his first fight in pride against uh, uh, keep Henson. We've talked about a split decision, but buddy that show a joe to me maybe. I mean pride had so many legendary cards as well, but everyone always asked me who I want to get into pride fighting championships. What do I watch a lot? I always tell them to start with Bushido nine, the tournament where you had one where that fight. Well, the fight with a Hanson and uh, um, we just talked about it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Edwards, but hobbled. Go me to fight of the year candidates and one night against Louise Azeredo and touch with your copper jewelry, Dan Henderson, Gono and shown in tremendous night of fights, bro. Yeah. Then those are some of the ones that kind of get lost or forgotten about making ensign anyway, or which who I mentioned because I have a funny story with Anson. I bet you he challenged him. Mara. Challenge Enzo. Let's. Hey, let's re. Let's rewind that. Shall We? Oh my God. Mr. Mark Coleman and uh, Kevin Randleman. We were in a Boston hotel room. Uh, this is after pride event. We don't know which one and a pride back then. Love to party. Loved to experiment like, you know, and I'm a good humble, uh, innocent Canadian boy who hadn't really gotten out much joe and palate. When we say experiment, we talked about like my kind and similar to the buses are more.

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       Have you ever taken a percocet? I'm like, what? And he's like, have you ever taken a percocet? So I of course look at it up or pink color. How would I want to know what I'm not interface. Come on, you've got to try it. I said, okay, well why not? So he gives me, you gave me three percosets do not one, three. So I take these things. Okay, fine. Just whatever coleman and randleman walk in and uh, all of a sudden, you know, I'm, I'm still, I'm not feeling a negative. Oh me, I'm very impatient. I'm like, well, what the Hell is not working? It's not working. Randleman asked boss. He goes, what do you give them in Bosco? I gave them three percocet. You did well, and then all of a sudden almost on cue it hits me and I ended up, uh, incident anyway, was there a with us as well visiting and I ended up, for some reason going into my old, a pro wrestling manager.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       He'll mode and going right up to incent and go, hey, I think I can take you bro. I think I can take. And I'm doing this again. I'm really just kind of needling him and he, he, he's trying to be nice. He knows, okay, this is the English announcer, cool. Whatever. But I am pushing it because I'm, I'm impacted by percosets by. But do you, are you thinking that you're doing a performance? No, that's, that's the thing. I, I felt like I was, I was hot. I was, I was like, I was out of my mind. I thought you were going to eat up insane anyway. I don't think I could beat him up, beat him up, Joe. But I challenged him a fight. He finally had enough faith in me, broke my glasses and I got a bloody nose and I'm like, well, now I've got to wear the badge of honor. And I took the picture with him and uh, an ensign and I'm like, yeah, I don't think I'll be doing percosets anymore. I'll stick to that. The only time they're trained killers. Yes. Thank you. Yes. And never get it. Thanks to the good guy. Really good guy.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       He hit the ground. He's not gonna. Do you remember when last? Randy couture? Yes. And He, uh, he was one of the first guys I ever saw through a really hard kicks to the legs from his guard. And I remember watching that going, oh, look at this, because he would prop himself up on his back on me, whip that leg into it. And he hit randy with some hard kicks back boy, my boy frank shamrock Tomlinson and new way. A lesson at the rampage when his brother. What sentence? Brothers and the Egan. Egan. Oh yeah, there were because of what frank did. And speaking of brawls, how bout a coleman and Maricio Shogun Hua? When, uh, who, uh, went to post, broke his arm and shoot a saint house. Phil filled Beverly Silva. Stepping on. Phil Baroni said pride was wild, Bro. It was amazing. You guys had like real street or in the back?

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       Oh yeah. Well that just walking into the place, high ingrained. She decides out of the blue. I have no cool way to pull the fire alarm. This is before the whole show stopped. And buddy the extinguisher fell like a colored extinguished coggin coming and he's screaming. Yeah. Everything falls out of the freaking ceiling. Fire retardant, he released it, he released in the sky and the show went on. Anyway, he's just walking and suddenly he separates himself from the group and he hits them and you don't fight that night. What's? Yeah, that was the first time when he said, well, the sheet was the first time five members of the Gracie family had ever competed on the St Cordova. Daniel by marriage. Right. So you had, you had hedsel and Carlos. Nancy had Henzel highend whoa. Dorrigo. Daniel. And who was the other one? I'm missing disrespect, but the Daniel thing is a weird one.

Speaker 1:          00:39:54       Is that your last name? Where's it your wife's last name? What in the fuck is going on here, sir? And went to a boxing gym one. I could use the boxing the during, you know, to train and the guy comes to me and he says, if you want I can teach you some groundwork. She, she didn't want me. Gracie, I see your gray. She is married to a gracie. Oh, how strange. And a button. But that night high and took the mic after and went off. I mean using every expletive known demand just snapped because of the controversy and well, high end was the craziest of all. And we had some good times with him. Oh real good time to what? I eat. A tortured soul, but at the toss anyway. Always a good one of the few. Not few, a lot of guys, but he always went out of his way to make me. I mean, you're a legend, but to make the announcer feel good, he always came up more. Hello, good to see you. And well, once you get old, uh, the bounces, Dallas randleman body, the very first New Year's Eve we spent in Japan for shockwave, it was you, Kevin Randleman highend gracie winter because he knew he is the one that made the most sense. Was this guy you were the one that kept the peace because Kevin was, was losing his mind and even hiring gracie kept saying, don't worry, we'll be

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       okay. And I'm like, why? He goes, just trust me. We're okay. And I swear to God, I thought he might've had a gun, but what do you buddy buddy buddy saying like, well that's going to be okay about. Okay. So he bought some weed from someone bounces there and, and, and I didn't look because, you know, it's, it's, it's felony there. So I just get it and we walk off and while we will walk off, we realized that I pick it out. I said, oh, that is not enough. So I go back and I say, guys, that's not enough. You need to get me more. And he goes, no, that's not going happen. And he has this attitude. I said, okay, well let me do it different. I'm going to be back in 10 minutes and we're going to be back in 10 minutes. And then, uh, it better be here.

Speaker 2:          00:42:08       So we walk around, we thought, you know, maybe we should look it up, at least as we relax and we're in this weird, what is it, a mailbox just like, it's, it's a complex. And suddenly I'm reading and starts jumping up and she start getting angry and he hits a mailbox. Ryan stocks and I'll try to keep this book. He's guys down and I go, no, no, no, you guys relax. Relax. I just to shut up my friend. I say to write and right, go talk to me. Like this was saying, come on man. Are you really doing this right now? Let we get this whole fight goes on. I said, no, no, we got to stay relaxed. You smoke a little weed, we're going to go back. Finally everybody calmed down. We go back and these guys probably call somebody, but oh no, no. First of all, these big guys.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       And I walk over and say, Oh, so um, we need to right now and they say all we need to wait to, because they're bringing it right now. So right away already we're looking back at sure enough, there's two big guys coming. Also same clothes as they have and you can see them very sturdy walking up to us and as soon as they see us, they make a one 80 and it talked back into fold. Goes from the guy and I go, those are the guys calling you right now telling you you got to give it up. And he goes, he opens the phone and the guy and he says, okay, and he puts it down and he gave us a whole mountain founders. It was right over a movie man. It was hilarious. But the whole altercation when everything, everybody started jumping. That's what Quintin left. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       We have a great times. Great Times. Yeah. Crazy Times. Just a good time. Yep. How, how much of a presence was the whole Yakuza thing while you guys were there? Like how? How aware of you guys have it where you guys know? I know I was nobody. Nobody would notice this launch and drugs. They don't do anything like that, but real estate. You saw people sitting down there. Okay. You said they were missing fingers. Crazy. That was where Masato boxer was traveling into your organs. They're all a strip club and this guy sits there and I'm with long hair and he comes over to me and says, hey, how you doing? Like a little feminine and really weird. You've got to be the biggest fan. Are you be financial? Oh, now we got this crazy guy here, right? That I had no clue what to think. And um, he said,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       oh, you're a great fighter. You want to know what I do? And he takes his shirt off and it's all padded up and people start literally leaving the place there. And I realized he's yogurts are right. So we started talking. I was talking about a n n, a n a to that. I wanted them this color. I said, but in America it's hard to find at that time people only wanted to use black ink. And he says, no, that's not hard at all. Why don't you come tomorrow morning and, uh, I can do this for you. So the next day he and I, we go to this dungeon, like five stories under the ground. It was the weirdest place. We opened the door, there is a cage would have back that Masato which indicates two dobermans and fly up against the thing. It's like this human skulls everywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       This pictures of books killing people. This guy taught me and he starts screaming and older people are getting to to it. At that moment. They all get up and they run out the displays. They locked the door and I look at myself, I'm like, Ooh, you know, because this is a really weird situation. But no, he wasn't. He did a great work, you know, but it was. He started looking. We made it big picture. Take a video of you. I'm going to, because I have a skull with a bullet hole in there. Record an audio will as well because there was a cage where Masato used to kickbox deadline, so he would train in a cage in a basement. Well, five stories below. We kept going down. It was the craziest thing. If you think about they have, you know, you go like that with the Dobermans in their regular trading joe.

Speaker 4:          00:46:07       But that's, that's what the guy said that it was Masato me may have even maybe had an interest in Masato fought cool. Vince Phillips, who? Vince Phillips, American boxing champion, the boxer, right? And he went over and fought Masato, Masato lift those legs. Chagas animal at that time. I mean even against the Dutch guy. So you can find Masato versus weekends. Phillips is really interesting to see you lift those legs up like a Christmas tree box. Top flight. American boxer fight against a kickboxer prime max. Two thousand three. Yeah. But you know, in your. Just accommodating my earl phillips in his defense, he was beyond his privacy. His body had started to fade. Well, but he, that he was kicking kicked across the legs. But who was it that took one kick and got out of the ring? Ray Mercer reimbursing, knocked down, but mercer was a with the Kimbo when the MMA thing. But it was the fighter winter, Japan, the American boxer and took one kick and stopped. Got Out of the rain. Came on, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was more not more sense. Nah, I forgot. No, I, uh, yeah. Similar. Yeah. Yeah. It was a blonde guy. But look at Masada was awesome sense. Doesn't really helpful to the kids and

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       massage. I was going across to cross the arms and then across the back leg to rob came and style. He did a lot of that and he just moved a lot and just kick those legs like every time we there. You see Phillips is already starting to wear down and Masato was a good boxer to men. It's like you couldn't deny his hands. I mean, he might not have been the same box with Vince. Phillips was in prime. We're all those leg kicks. It makes such a difference. Do you remember? Go Me and Paul over at shockwave. Uh, I thought that was some of the best mma boxing bus we'd seen at that time would really. And he goes down. He just couldn't get up. Did you remember that film? He knocked him down. What about her hair? We're taught off as well, Sergei. We're taught early in pride show.

Speaker 3:          00:48:16       Good box. Everyone has that debate and argument about, oh, boxing. How would they do it? We know it's two different sports, but when it comes to that aspect of MMA, the boxing will start. Gameplan indicate one surgeon, he had quite a few [inaudible] and then recently got back into mma, right. Didn't, he didn't do, but he got clipped. Complete animal guy. He used to train the fader. I remember all the way back. That was one big group because that remembered a split at the time and watching what happened to him. You know, he was a great guy to illustrate. Funny, Nice Guy. One of the scariest stoppages I oversaw was um, uh, was against semi shelt. Do you remember when he mounted semi shelter and got on top of them and like a mounted triangle and start smashing Aratana punching them. Whoa. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hey everybody. He's just punching them in one eye over and over and over. I remember that. That was sent me. Shit, man. Such a physical.

Speaker 3:          00:49:19       He just didn't have the ground round exactly with Keratin on right then. And Keratan off. Just took him onto. I mean that was back when she sent me, was beating everybody in key with that long Friday. Crazy at the time. The first time I sold for change it, I was commentating this fight in the Ukraine and uh, it was a while ago. That was a really. Did the whole trip was a wild trip. Oscar Charlie Anzalone, you know the folks from Vegas, um, but he, he put in an eight men tournament. He was the lightest guys, like under 90 pound tournament and he destroyed all these guys. I think the lightest guy, he fought to a supple violence. That was the lie. This guy at two to 3:30. It was insane. I mean, do I need just knocked everybody out and I go like, this Chechen guy gets a pretty good.

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       I remember he fought on this big giant matt once they did something that was almost like they made it up a basketball court and he fought on it. It's an interesting thing, but I've been bringing this up a lot lately. I really think mma we'd be better off of the largest surface and no cage, just like a basketball court, just like that site. Welford sightlines definitely. I agree with you and teach us. What about what came up against the kid? That's cool. Metamorris type fighting surface for MMA. I don't weld. The problem metamorphosis is elevated, right? Like you don't want to do. It's fallen. No, no, no, exactly. But that kind of like that'll do space. I think a big open space on the ground, just mad at ground level. You almost to let a cage though to had they had the tip for cameras is not gonna work.

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       It's gonna be very hard for the audience to see as well because it's all one level, but that's in a lot of people. Accord is all one level. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. A lot of people say though when they go to an event that they are watching the screen because of that, but I think you could do it on a basketball court, but just think that it. It dates still see here at a basketball boards, the people on the floor, they can at least see the cage, the bottom of the cage, but if somebody sits in front of him, they can't see anything. Well, if you have tiered seating, if you have like stadium style seating and then there's be a front row and then there's gotta be some sort of dividing line because you don't want to get run over if you're in the front row.

Speaker 3:          00:51:31       Some fucking gorilla. It's like wrestling a college wrestling. Yeah. Yeah. If a referral comes piling through and slams on your girlfriend and breaks both her legs or Travis Browne, it was in the front row. Yes, it could be a problem, but it could be an issue. The front row, it could be an issue, but as long as they keep people from bug piling into the crowd because if you could have that, you would be able to watch something happened with no cages. There's one thing that I see over and over again, like it's a very grueling aspect to mma when guys are tied up against the cage and they're clenching and it throw a nice the body and they're throwing elbows and titan is a grueling sort of, but it's also grueling in an artificial way like it's artificial that they're pressed up against something and that that cage becomes a factor in the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:52:14       What it doesn't have to be a factor. I think the more factors you can remove extraneous factors outside of your opponent, the better to fall is an extraneous factor and you could use it to your advantage. Be pressed people up, he'd take them down with it. There's a lot of things you could do to get back up from it, but I really feel like it's an automatic brake or is that taking too much that away for the fight. If you go against the fence, I stopped. I'm still going to have electricity on the fence that that would be something I championships, but it will hold people who are total savages. They would hold someone against the fence, see who could take the pain, the most bold jolted to the difference going from a former ring to a cage is already huge because there's no corner, so I can only imagine that that means she'd know the wool walking no more.

Speaker 3:          00:53:13       Everything that Bernard Hopkins knockout last week, not last week, last month or so, went through that ring like that and fell down on his head. I was like, how do they not protect against this? We have to remember there was a real pride frank to already there with their numbers on their back. Remember this kid that was. But that was always one of the problems about the pride ring, right? You were forced to break lion fight too. I was watching one, a car Hollenbeck's fights and he, he fell out of the ring and smacked his knees on the edge of the, uh, apron as he was falling out. I remember Marvin Eastman falling out of a ring of Vancouver almost seriously hurting himself as well before he got the goats for Jonah. Why don't they have like a netting in between the ropes to keep prevent people from falling through? It still serves the same purpose.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       You would think so, right? Yeah. Well, more vertical rope to swell in between. Do you remember the old valley to doe fight between Palae and Chuck Liddell? Yeah. They had a net under the first rope. The bottom row was shoving them in there and they were bare knuckle fighting chocolates, punched him in the face, bare knuckle, and he couldn't escape. He would just tucked in there like a fish fuck beat out of them. Jesus Christ. Gary Goodrich with the Pedro. When he went to squeeze the pillow does. Yeah. He went right into his pants and grabbed a hold of his junk and crushed his balls in his hand and he had some grit. Man, I can tell you, I listened to a hotel one time and getting a massage and while I'm getting the massage to the girl that put a towel over your face, right? So I don't know who's massaging me.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       And suddenly the massage gets stronger and stronger and stronger as she starts crushing my shins. You know, like really hot, I throw the towel and go, hey, and it's a big data, good risk taking over to massage my legs. So I know he has a grip. Yeah. What a crazy thing that was a rule. You, you were allowed to grab the balls and so what about the rules will never see knees to the head. Right? Under the unified rules, they just implemented some more rules than you. You want it to get rid of the midnight to 12 to six, but they changed that, right? Yeah. Wow. We should explain to people what it means in mixed martial arts. You not allowed to drop an elbow down from like vertical. You can drop it from 12 to 6:00 and the only reason why that was invented back in the day when the commissions were approving mma, big John Mccarthy had to meet with them and they wouldn't let anybody do that because they had seen people break bricks on espn by dropping elbows like that.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       And like if someone could pick a brick, they could kill a person can do it like this. Right. It's so stupid. I mean, it's probably like one of the, I mean, I wouldn't say it's the week, it might be my weakest elbow, but I. it's one of the weaker elbows. Yeah. I don't think it's nearly as strong as that kind of elbow pleasure. If you hit a skull and I can tell it's totally still splinted for me when I fall. Adrenaline and. Okay. That was from three to whatever you want to, you know, that door, horizontal elbows, but still you don't want to hit. It's. Yeah. You get field as little pieces. You know, it's, it's from this call from Kevin. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, it's just a dumb rule, you know, and that's the one blemish and Jon Jones record when he fought. Dropping those elbows. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       Totally legal. Yeah. I don't know why they haven't put that back in a while. I thought that's what they were going to do. Maybe they hit an nice socket, may bend to. I could be really damaged, but then again you can do that standing like someone could tomahawk you standing and it could go right into your eye socket about soccer kicks and stomps Mr. Rogen. Well, see, that's one of the things that we could have if we had a basketball court, you know, you would have soccer kicks on the ground like for sure. I think so, yeah. I think violent. I've never punched somebody on the ground. You should be able to kick a member of when he was. First of all, the stomping is great, but I couldn't believe it tomorrow. Right. Condo condo veteran, who's actually cut the Czech Republic tomorrow. Why he? Well, he saw a box team. Mauricio Shogun Hua loves soccer. He did. He, he pedaled kick this big ring Sakharova. His face looked like the elephant man to that. There were some violent tendencies. Environment I think is probably once when Sakharova fought. Melvin manhoef. That was horrendous. Melvin was coming up in his prime and Sakharova was on the way down in. Melvin was arguably one of the scariest strikers of all time. Just unbelievably violent. Just took violence to a totally different level, knocked out Mark Hunt.

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       You know what? I think he had a double mark, had a double knock out there and I, you got to pull it up to see if I'm right. I believe if my shirts, we was locked out twice, you know, he was knocked out and when he fell down he hits the cup also for maneuver and we had all of the old steel cups and he hits a talk. He falls down, he sees boom under coping. I think maybe that sealed the deal, right? They're just saying, we'll find that. Find that story. Mark hunted. Well now we will probably. Or what's he doing with the lot. But again, another guy, he's a, he's got the UFC because the UFC day he's saying that they knew here here's a fight. Oh, hold on. Go right here. I hope my charges paid him full under. Yeah. I need bumps and forward with the Times on the way down to go and mark the cost. Yeah, right into the steel account man. And it's like he was sprawling almost. You push his hips forward. Wow. Yeah. He was, he still is an animal. The guy that ever lived

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       by the sword wore one of those steel cups. Will is a mere renova already. He used to wear one of those steel cups and he'd get on top of mount. Yet with that fucking Steel Cup, he was quite the goddamn weapon. Press it into things that he was the star of your stag stag. Still people that are under steady in half. God, if I shouldn't have gotten somebody, have God right, and if I sit in it, I grew up in bite ahead. I can literally bounce his own knee into his face. That's an illegal move. MMA, and it's a real easy thing to do. Imagine that. The Nice right over here, just thrust my hips forward. His own knee will bash in his face and ask big. Joe Mccarthy says, yeah, that's illegal move. So I go, man, I haven't seen anybody do that. But that little lid knocking himself out, but different way.

Speaker 4:          01:00:09       See, you're pushing his head into his knee. No, I grab his head. By the time he can not push me backwards and then I drive my hips forward and his own knee because his leg is here over here, I can fit into his own face and he's going to stop my hip power, which is going to be very hard to do for him, for him in that same position. Hm. Have you drilled that? I in my class. I teach it. Yeah. Huh? Guys pull that off. Oh, it's a real easy thing. It's very hard for you to stop me. That's interesting. We can jump into my, you, I can show it to you. Isn't that funny? When people learn things and you go, oh, well there's that now, right. You know, for a long time guys would go uh, and they would go and throw under hooks on like from the half guard and then they would try to like sneak up to your body and then work their way in.

Speaker 4:          01:00:58       But then people started Darson people. So then that under hook became like a real liability for those long arm Doris guys. And that's just sort of had a, it had a change, you know, it had a, people have evolved. We've installed an early days with the kickboxing Tyberg book show, Ramon Dekkers, you know, in the clinch, pushing somebody away, boom, hiking and it went down and then you see everybody starts doing it, then everybody knows you that doesn't work anymore. And then he did. He pushed away with the low kick and I go, wow, when I teach this a lot in my class too, because if I push you, you're off your balance shifts backwards show you don't flex your leg. That low kick doesn't need to be hard. Trust me, because the muscle is relaxed. It goes straight through. So a little while you kick as a very good thing to do.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       You look at the expeditious evolution of it. When we go back and remember doing voiceover for some pancreas, have fights for fight network in Toronto and, and you know back where you go and you watch a sport under what was mma rules and well there's that, there's that, but it just didn't exist to them at the time in there. The, the, the, the mindset or the, the, the drilling as you say, and it's, it's, it's interesting when you look at now people who, that's all they've trained in guys like a courtyard, pat for instance, and all these kids, Tj dillashaw where it's, it's, it's, I love this growth. There's only a certain amount of moves that you can do right there. Like armbars. Everybody's always just chokes. It's Dah weight towards

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       those. If you find a different way going through that certain Armbar, then you surprise somebody and that you see that happening a lot. Suddenly it as a triangle choke, the new triangle, choke setup. Then everybody starts doing it and it's gone again, but it's just about that. The move is there, but what the setup is every certain kicks, right? Well, karate and taekwondo. Same thing that you thought, oh, that would never work, and all of a sudden everyone's know for a while. The front kick to the face and frank with you seen that with wonderboy. Wonderboy is perfect example of what I thought was going to be the next stage of evolution as the sport karate guys. The guys, you know, like Michael Venom page, Raymond Daniels, Daniels, and what these guys are doing is they're showing that if you have all those other skills will then those traditional martial arts techniques become very novel and people don't know what to do with them.

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       Like with wonderboy and he started stabbing people with that front leg side kick and then throws that frontline round kick. People don't know what to do with. Cool. And he's also got that crazy style of leak leaning back and forth like a snake popping back in. It's gonna be very interesting to rematch though because I think. I think even though it was a draw, I guess according to the score card it would be a draw. When you look at who did more damage, it's clearly woodley woodley did way more damage in two rounds he had. He had wonderboy and some serious shit. Yup. And also for whatever inexplicable reason, and he doesn't even know why I asked him about it after the fight. He didn't take them down after the first round. Am I cute? You know, he was like, if you asked me right now, I have no idea why I did and he's like, I got 20 years of wrestling, you would think I would use it, and he had so much success in the first round, taking them down.

Speaker 5:          01:03:55       But then again, he almost knocked him out in the fourth round to remember he stunned them in the fourth round, just shoulders, eyes, book. Yeah. Yeah. It was, um, it was a pretty, it was an interesting fight because would wonder. Boy Did regain some points and regained some ground, but he never really had woodley in any real trouble. And I think that is always the ultimate point of fighting is like who puts the other person in grave danger? And clearly woodley put wonderboy in grave danger. He had him stand. Deanna fucked up. He was beating him up. He caught them. He had them in a guillotine, looked like his head was gonna pop off. He had him in far more dangerous. The cutesy was something else. Scrase escaped. I'm out. I just wonder how. I wonder how he holds his hands. You know, because there's some guys that are, it's a diy, there's different ways to hold your hands where you can really like accentuate the bone into the neck and really there's little minute details and gay teens that you never know. Right. That's the Alpha male members of wicked ones. Yep. And of course Marcello Garcia. So he's probably got one of the best teams I've ever seen in history. Grappling competition. Yup. You know, and then cody mackenzie had that fucking crazy squished down the side and that's what John Jones used to go to prayer. Hey, old marine during pride days member, he had a slick year team. Vito Belfort, right?

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       He's in my class like a while ago, there was in my old gym and we've been working out tonight teaching my class. I say, Hey, would you like to teach that guillotine to the, to the guys? Yeah, sure. He said, yeah, put me in as far as so I could feel how it is. But he went freaking 80 percent and I go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I mean that was a scam. Why? Why? Because she's got these long arms, you know, and they, they go around and it's like the prayer becomes a bloodshot instead of just crushing the windpipe. Yeah. He's so jacked. He's, he's such a fucking giant dude too with those long arms, you know, you show to see him doing like lifting cars and all that stuff that he didn't hold it, that walking with like 150 kilos, you know, 75 kilos in each thing and then running with it, you know, like a suitcase.

Speaker 4:          01:06:02       Again, another guy who represents redemption in the sport and you, you'll here now what's going on with Rhonda and everything, but even mark Carney, mma, I'm, you know, I spent a few years now doing boxing. We're one last ruins your career. It seems for whatever stupid reason, but in mma there are so many redundant. Even overeem has been up, down, up. There's still a bad narrative and boxing, unfortunately someone who loses a fight doesn't come back. It was going to help that I think for a bit. It did. I mean, Bernard Hopkins had an old fame career after losing his first fight. So I don't understand that. Then Gable, Dan Gable, he uh, we were interviewing him and he saw this record and like, but with randy couture record another record and he goes, like, he's a world champion, but we're talking to a guy who lost once in his life, you know, so he goes, oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       He was totally shocked by it. Many ways to win, many ways to lose, right Wayne, different world people are throwing their punches and kicks and catching you with knees and take them down. Cro Cop was, the guy told us in Japan that if you don't lose an mma, you really haven't fucked. Had been. He was trying to make the point of, you know, it's, it's, it's so tough guys that are gonna happen, man. It's also evolving. It's radical pace. I mean, you're seeing all these new approaches constantly changing. So many great minds involved. Yeah, that's what I liked. I mean, ferris a hobby and I made want the list can go on. But that's what, that's what I become now a bit more of a nerd because you call so many fights in you. You try to have a life as well, but I'm really now getting back into, okay, let's catch up and see what these different minds of sang well and you yourself sir, even, you know, listening to this, it's just always so cool to, to hear different perspectives and.

Speaker 4:          01:07:46       Okay. Yeah, that's super important for all of us. I think that's why Bj's going to do good. It really, I truly believe drinking because he changed camp. I think talent, like Bj in his training in Hawaii, you know, he kinda dictates whatever he wants to do. He's so talented. He schools people around and that's why when you put people like that on the pressure, they get tired because they never experienced that enduring because he's so way ahead above everybody else. So if they want to do extra three rounds with him, he prayed and he doesn't want to do it. He's going to gonna I'm not going to do I. it's a bad example that

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       drake at Greg Winkeljohn, you know, and there he's got all these guys gunning for him. It's Alegent. I mean I can only imagine the sparring sessions they have going on. I think it's going to do really well for him now. His opponent? Yeah. Rodriguez is really good know, so. Okay. But I had a conflict the whole honestly the. He's a hall of Famer. Done everything we saw against Frankie Edgar. What is it? We talked about our podcast. The last one was Matt Hughes. Twenty 10. Do you. Why do you think he's still fighting? Well, he probably feels like he didn't do it right. He probably feels like the fights he took with Frankie where you had that really bizarre standup stance here was the weirdest thing I've ever seen. He decided that he was going to fight that way because it was more efficient and it didn't use as much energy as widening his stance and he, I think a lot of his career he was concerned with losing his energy in the ring.

Speaker 5:          01:09:04       Yup. A lot of his crew. He's worried about gassing. Yep. So then he went with [inaudible]. Right. So he does these two camps with Marvin intervention at least two camps. Correct. He did. Sean Sherk and I. Thank you. Did Diego Sanchez? I know he did. Diego Sanchez, because I know also that Steve Maxwell was training Diego Sanchez got Sanchez in incredible shape, but that was Bj in his prime and when Bj wasn't tired when he was in shape and he was joking around about it, like when I have a six pack here before, what was it? He wasn't just a different animal back then, but it was only sustainable for like a few fights. I think Bj, it's for whatever reason, it was hard for him to get totally motivated to get into that kind of shape again. And when he described it, it sounded hilarious. Like he couldn't hold his daughter, literally, literally so tired after working out that he couldn't even hold his kid.

Speaker 5:          01:09:52       And they have a very specific training philosophy to the marina bitches. And uh, in a lot of ways, um, uh, some of the guys that like Nickerson who trains under his philosophy and speed of sport in California, they want strength and conditioning to be number one priority number one. You already know how to fight. I love that. Yeah. And the idea is like, you already know how to find it. Okay. So since you already know how to fight, you should just work on having the most incredible aerobic threshold, which is back to frank and a plan to Ortiz. Well, yeah, but even Franco with the. Why am I going to Kip Maury Smith with a new partner show you in the beginning, that's what frank was all about was the. Couldn't be cardio. The cardio was so important on the bus back when Tito lost you, frank.

Speaker 5:          01:10:37       I was in the same bus going back to the airport that Tito was jump next to me and he starts asking me a question about seven because I always said is the most important thing. You can never have enough stamina. That's the most important choice that asking drills and doing all these things. And then he became that crazy cycle, cardio cardio, you know, and he started beating everybody. So he was transferred that to Kendall Grove and one of the guys on the train into the ultimate fighter Kendall came out of that show and that's what he told me. He was like, it's all cardio, man. Everything is about cardio when. But again, cardio also. What about the nerves then and how much panicking and your emotions drained? Like what I'm saying plays factor in it,

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       but the actual real cold hard cardio plays a factor too. Then it also plays a factor in your nerves because if you know that you have a small gas tank and you started your lit up. Yup. And especially when you walk to the ring, did I train hard enough? You know, if you know that you can really go, you know, after work I done, we'll do seven, six minutes round. So that type at full blast, that's like 42 minutes and. But that was after a workout but I knew that nobody did that so I was not going to run out of gas because we had half our fights in Japan but it's the only way to do it. Constantly go hard. And I had guys coming who couldn't do the warmup in my class is a 20 minute warmup, is the boss where to work with the sprawls and at a minutes I fill them up with the idea pushups or with the kettlebell swings.

Speaker 1:          01:11:56       So it's 20 minutes straight. People come in who had a fight like in two weeks in Japan and it couldn't do it. They had to man. I said, don't fight. He said, what do you mean? I said, this is the warm up. It didn't even start now and let's say they lost because of cardio over there, but how. But how do you do it? As I said, it's just baby steps it. You just get yourself to the point where you can get through that entire warmup, full clip and then just. Yeah, just keep doing it. Who can do things? So best conditioned athlete right now in MMA or what? Like what are names that come to mind? Is Alaska's right away I would think. Right. Cane and he's a freak. He's afraid. I mean there's a lot of really good guys down 90 miles. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:32       He's tired, but he's also so efficient. You could also say the same thing about cody and dominic. Yeah, I was going to say that was more civil war for 25 minutes. No, you're right. There's a lot more. It's becoming a bigger deal. In the early days it was only the WC guys because I've got a lighter guys, but now everybody, while they hit me the most, if a guy comes in with no cardio for three rounds, I go, you're serious. It's like bringing a half a can of paint. If you're a painter too, you do the door half. Yeah. That's the only thing I have. It's the same thing. But your ds, the Ds Boys, Nick and native. Uh, always. I mean, when you think of wow, the triathlons, know that he swam from Alcatraz five times now five times now the podcast, like, what the fuck? He's coming. Is he coming back soon? Let's go get some, a world title fight. There are a bunch of miles. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I, I thought like, you know, crazy would be of connor fought nickname.

Speaker 1:          01:13:34       Now you say so they're already saying that connor, that he shouldn't have fought nate because nate was too big for him, but he made his a one. That's a fight that's going to happen again. You have to. Connor stays the 155 pound champ. Do you remember going to happen again? Oh, I wonder if it's on a grid. You Remember Diaz in daily? Sitting there and just calling him like twice. He was knocked down twice back and stopped him with three seconds left recoveries. Always fantastic. That seminar in Goma and then the fricken thc. Why did they test for that? While we don't want to get into that now, I'm sure is an athletic conditioning. Tests tests forever. All my friends, they're tell you. Okay. They're saying now that they're gonna they're thinking about calming down on that and then not. Not even caring if people test positive.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       Well, I hope so. Which would be a good thing because the way the level show in your skin and the way it stays in your fat, like if you got high the night before a fight, you're not going to feel it during the fight. You just not. But if it's an of will show up maybe. Yeah, but you'd have to really fucked up and over and you'll probably get new ideas on his podcast. I have not ever seen anybody. One of those gummy bears was like $1,200. The only guy I think he ate ate, that's so insane. Like that writer from the New York newspaper went to Denver and did a piece and she ate a whole shock by guests who was like eight different doses or how many different doses and talk wrote about her good oil. Yeah, you shouldn't be paranoid. You're a little flesh bag on the planet.

Speaker 1:          01:15:23       My daughter went to a planet totally through infinity. You should be nervous as fuck. Ever. We'd go rock could fly on the sky and kill you. I thought I took it. I made a quiche. Some cookies. This is eight, nine years back. And uh, I, I crank one because they're heavy cookies and while I'm eating a little crumble fulls of the ground and I, I see the dog right away running over it. I want to stop it and I go, you know, but the little tiny bit, right. So I'm eating it and I have to pick up something from a friend of mine who was like 20 minutes away here somewhere in the valley. Uh, I go pick it up, I'm back in the car and as soon as I'm in the car started driving and it hits me. I'm going to hit and within two minutes I got a phone call from my wife.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       What did you do? I remember talk outside, staring outside for like two and a half hours. No, which is looking at site. It was the funniest thing. I came home. He was just like poor, poor Louis has been high a few times. Luna doesn't like men, but she made a connection, but no, that's a rather intimate one. She doesn't like men for some reason. She, oh, she will go after you. Wow. Kits and women are cool, but a guy, oh, the mailman literally does the dog that will go a full mode attack. It is a little dog is 15 pounds. So it's the dog, a poodle. I love that. Oh, that's hilarious. Her. How's your arm? It looks like you're getting a lot of muscle back and your arm. You know, at the top. I'm getting it back, but you see below there still something to be done. I'm here with an a in the valley. There's a doctor now and he does these crazy injections also. Uh, and it's elite. It's caught to nervous scorch somewhere. So. And I feel that something is caught costs. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       to impinged. Yeah. So what they say is if you take a fire, a water hose, if you squeeze it, water comes out. That's the same with an nerf action comes out and that apparently they made this special, a picture that they only could do in, uh, Santa Monica and they saw that it was blocked there and he can apparently he can inject me there and they will take the pressure off and he, he believes that that's very possible that we'll come back then. So yeah, it's crazy because she stepping, my fingers is still very hot and I get this. But I could do that for four years. Wow. That even snapping my fingers. So slowly but surely it works. I just work out the arm and the shoulder shoulder comes back also a little bit.

Speaker 5:          01:17:47       That's the thing that they say about nerves, right? That any kind of nerve damage takes a tremendous amount of time to heal because nerves, they grow vag very, very slow, very slow people. They don't understand it. I always say it's like digging the spark plug out of a,

Speaker 2:          01:18:00       a cylinder that's your nerve. Once the nerve is broke, you take that out, it's gone. And then to atrophy comes, you know, because people go like, how can you then be paralyzed? I said, what happens with people who bring it up,

Speaker 5:          01:18:10       right? Yeah. I said no more nerves going to the legs. She can't walk anymore. And that's the same thing what I have right now. Only the nerve is still there. It's just pressured. I ran into some kid after a show the other day and we were talking about neck injuries, uh, and Jujitsu and he was asking me a question and he's like, my arm doesn't work under here. My tricep starting to fade away. And Mike, dude, go to a doctor yesterday. You got to get an Mri as soon as you start seeing atrophy and as soon as you start feeling numbness, you got to get on it right away. Yep. Any impingement to necklace because there are some ways that they can sort of relieve the pressure and spinal decompression and a bunch of different platelet rich plasma type of injections, like Regena keen and stuff, but you got to do something and you got to do something quick and you can't keep rolling. All these guys, they want to keep going to Jujitsu. Even when their back's fucked up like that. And then like as you're rolling, you feel like you feel like that twinge and shooting, doing real damage to yourself. You've got to be super careful with any kind of nerve injuries. I waited too long. That was the thing with me. I waited too long. I realized I saw my arms slinking and then I go, oh, I gotta go to the doctor. But it was already.

Speaker 2:          01:19:15       I should've gone faster as soon as the pride. Why? Why didn't you go sooner? I don't know. I thought it was going to fix itself. I've been this indestructible guy from my windows from rooms that are not your thing, you know? I mean I feel I'm from a roof. I fell on my face on the other step and I put all my t stayed in. It's the craziest thing. You can tell by my front teeth. I have something, but I mean, how did my feet did not come out. I mean that was quite a fall. You fell on your face from a roof. You know what happened. So you know those, how you call those letters, you know the, the, the feet pointed one. I'm very smart. Of course it's stands like this and I'm standing it up and I'm pushing something and of course when I push the ladder stairs like this, I pushed myself away and I'm following all the way down, see a slow motion coming because one of the,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       one of those stats things I go like, oh, I'm going to fall on it. I realize I'm going to go slow motion. So I stuck my arms out. I think I'm good, but it was longer than my arm for, oh Geez. I train on that thing and it wasn't even dazed. I go like, oh, a very gentle. I went to my mouth, I go, please be in it. You know, and all my tooth fairy is insane. Right. That would have killed 80 percent of the population. You walk away with no loose teeth. That's fucking hilarious, man. That's hilarious. Yeah. So in all the times when you guys were working in pride, how did you see like when they were doing the. We've given guys big bags of cash. We guards there for. Oh yeah, we got those back because for us to come to tell them about the first time.

Speaker 1:          01:20:56       But what you wore when you went to the bank, you know, the first time I got paid, the first night Bushido you had to come and tell me, hey, this is, this is what's going to go. Because they're always just like you when you go into the bank. A bank, right. Perfectly packed. You know Chris' notes. I mean it looks like a monopoly money. Y'All really crisp $100 American bills. I was living in Canada. He was afraid I had to actually cry. I crumpled they up because when I brought brand new bills, I mean obviously they could tell it wasn't counterfeit, but they'd always look and go, what is this? That's literally every, every show, brand new $100. Million was always in the back of your head. You go like, I remember one time guns, people to fight us. They will talk over each other. Okay, let's let Bob.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       So go ahead. What? Every fight. If I'm like, they say, okay, from 10:00 AM tomorrow morning you can come and pick up your fight. There was only one room and every single fighter would ain't gonna. Even guys like miracle Crocapo I know me like 2 million bucks or something. But they made a lot of money at the time, you know? And they gave everybody cash. So I assumed they gave him Cassius well and I always thought men. But then again, if the equity has evolved and maybe don't want to do that, right? Yeah, you definitely have to bring 10 grand. Didn't remember they were telling family members. Here's your stacks marker. I mean everybody on our team at the whole 10,000 feet, 10,000 feet, because she can't bring more defense out. She took one bill off, so it was less than 10. Had the roles in Rappongi. That is so crazy. Yeah, that was wild, but it looked nice. It looked cool. When you came back, you felt you felt good. I felt like a criminal, criminal. The big rural Mexico actually got $2,000,000 in cash from the heavyweight Grand Prix and then put that in a suitcase and went back to Croatia. That's one of the most gangster fucking things I've ever heard in my life.

Speaker 1:          01:22:50       I mean, that's like that's a scene in a movie. Be beat the fuck out of everybody. A little title case you. When that sperm tournament, remember those sperm posters? Fucking person was awesome. One of the posters.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       I feel bad I got rid of. I had that post shirts or pluck. Remember that upright or plug? What does that mean? Nobody knew and what lights that there is no such thing as doing so. There's no sort of doing things as usual. There's no such thing as doing things such as usual. He said, I got to get the t shirt. That is the dumbest thing. Nobody's going to get a member of the Grand Prix poster with a woman breastfeeding the baby. Looks like, what the heck is going on? You have a Waleed Ishmael t shirt from like 1998. And it says, don't be coward, don't run off the fight. And it says on it at the time, wasn't a guy said he had made and he showed me and it was a direct translation for them. Fulfill for fight, for fight, for good luck with that buddy fight, but brutal miscalculations and translations because I lead with it.

Speaker 2:          01:24:13       He was hilarious. I remember he uh, uh, he was telling a story and then I realized what a, what I did. Because you did. It's just kind of, you know, I thought it was funny after my rental man flight, my base face was bashed in, right? So I blew my nose, of course, once I wasn't addressing one because then I could do it. I couldn't do it before. So needless to say, my eyes blew up and I never close. I could almost see anything anymore and we all wanted to go out and um, and it guy there and he goes, what are you going to do? I said, well, give me one second ahead of the doctor with me. I say, give me the, the syringe with the widest couch, you know, so I stabbed in my eye and I stopped sucking the blood out yet.

Speaker 2:          01:24:49       But that's when I heard he told that story and he goes, and this guy still see me in the Dah, Dah slugging it out. He puts some shade. So like the freaking terminator. And he says, come on, let's go do my accent. That's what I heard that I go to now. Now you see when you go back in time, you go, yeah, that was maybe a weird thing to. Right. So you stuck them in your eyelids. Like where did. Yeah. And I tried to find you, you pull just nothing coming out. You'd have a little further and suddenly you get blocked. When you do a blood test, you're still just start pulling, you know. And then I did and I could see again Jesus Terminator. That is so ridiculous. That is how many people have done that.

Speaker 2:          01:25:44       That's a super rare move. Stick a fucking needle under the bag under your arm and suck blood out of it. I'd say you're in a very rare company to try to try to stitch yourself up with, uh, with normal needles. I did that as well. I put a video in a long time ago. My wife at the beginning said, don't tell her that you were with your daughters yourself up. My daughter's filming. The other one is playing music of the fence. The dog is walking over my lack stinking, super, super antiseptic. Oh, you see this, this third. Oh, you're fired a fast. What was that cut from it. People won't believe it. I at the time I drank nonalcoholic beer and I walk outside and I grab a six pack of blackstone, Alcoholic Beer. I walk back in the six pack, breaks the bottles, hit the ground, and it shoots against my leg.

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       And I walk inside and they go, man, this hurts, right? There's this weird. And then I walk a few steps and this is crazy. So I pulled my pants down and I saw that cut. The piece of glass was still in it, so I had to pull it out and not go to an actual doctor. Okay. Because my wife was in Holland at the last time I did that. I was A. I overtrained in the sun for a promotion for the body action system and I have to go to the hospital because I was 93 degrees my body. I crying, I couldn't hold anything anymore. Everything started cramping. It was the weirdest thing. So they had to. This was like when you were filming that commercial? No, I did a workout video workout. I did the whole workout into at noon in the son Jesus on the top and how much I wanted to look good on the camera.

Speaker 2:          01:27:16       So I was hitting the thing as hard as I could, you know. And then of course I took all potassium. I tried every because I knew what this was going to happen, but still I started cramping crazy. So I went to the hospital, they put like two backs in me, then they put another two bags and the bags are empty and it's and um, we'd been there for a long time and have my kids with me because my wife is in Holland so they're there with me and it's 4:00 in the morning now and they still don't come back and it's already like an hour and a half. And I've been asking them and I, you know, I get angry. So I say, you know what, let's go guilt. What you'd never should do is pull it out yourself. If you do that, you need to put pressure on there. And now I know why that is because I sprayed the whole room full of blood.

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       So then my, my daughters had hold your finger on, the other one is I pulled it out to say I know we got to run. So we run out of the hospital and escape the hospital, escaped the hospital because I was dehydrated. So then my wife has gone again and this thing happens and she already didn't like it. That something crazy at the first time. So I go, you know what, I'm not going to go to the hospital. I'm going to be there again. It's become this big story. I'm just going to stitch it myself. So I asked the girls to find a needle for first like they do, but it broke and I go no. And then we followed one more left and they're really not sharp. You gotta really push to get it in there and uh, but it worked. It worked out perfect. I cleaned everything. I cleaned the rope with alcohol swipes, all that stuff. And I start stitching it and uh, well not much I can do my, my daughter, I go like, I say, oh, it's just like Rambo. I said, and she goes, who is, who is Rambo Daddy? Did he do it too? I said, yeah, yeah, you do. But who is she? Oh, sorry, he's an actor. He's. Oh, it was a movie. Yeah, it was in the movie. So he did not do it for real. Maybe you should do it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:06       Stitch themselves up either if you get like a first aid kit with needles and needle. Yeah, because if you have one of those needles, you know the little round ones, the hooks, it's an easy thing. You go really fast but you slip off because it's, you know, everyday the hardest things to go in. So what you need to do it when you have the cut, like for instance, if the one side, this one here's the cut and here right. You have to put your finger underneath so make your finger underneath and then you have to stab the needle there because otherwise every time what happens is this, it slips off. It doesn't go in. So you had to put my finger on an IV, going out what's easier. So once you're from the inside going out, that was easier to do. But the going in part, that was hard because it kept slipping in. It was not a really sharp new. Well yeah, that seems like a lot of work. Yeah. But it's better go to the hospital for four hours. A crazy glued. Something crazy. Gluco all my students. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:01       I got to go into the doctor. Come here.

Speaker 2:          01:30:04       Who really works the best as long as your finger doesn't get stuck on the wound as you're applying it. Oh, who said that? Somebody did that for fun with a friends with his mouth. Oh, that's good for lips. Ripped apart. Scar tissue over your lips. You don't want to hit the dumbest thing I've ever seen. It was a guy in Holland. They. They challenged him to put a pool ball into his mouth. Oh fuck. So once it was in, he did get it out. They had to break stitch out to get them out. Yet he almost couldn't breathe with. Gets the freaking ball was in his mouth.

Speaker 1:          01:30:43       Fix it to the next level is Christ. Fucking Christ had a break his teeth at the break. Steve Thought, oh my God. What a fucking retard. Oh my God. Can you do it? Yeah. What are you fucking three, three year old. Don't put that ball in your mouth. Probably with alcohol or you can't do it. Oh No, no. That is a problem. Yeah. Wow. God damn alcohol.

Speaker 2:          01:31:18       So what is going on with inside mma? Yeah, just fake. Just stopped. I just stopped before that. How long did you guys do it for? Nine years. Nine years. I did I think nine show.

Speaker 1:          01:31:31       Yeah. If I made that quota

Speaker 2:          01:31:34       nine years and then they just decided. I mean it was one of the most respected independent MMA shows on TV. I love it, you know, it was a really guy. I would have loved to have a little bit more heads up what you know. Well, Hey, when, when does a problem time slot sucked? That was the thing at the end do to, to go 9:30 Pacific time. The, the east coast. She's shut

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       everything down. It was the most dvr show they said. Yeah, well I'm sure. But people like to watch things when their current too. They have it at like 6:00 PM on a weeknight, what we've been saying, or several nights nights where you want to be, you know, to be on a Friday night. Like everyone's going. Yeah, they go out and show them. Man, it was a fun show. We had a good run, you know, and uh, we're, we're, we're back together to get her audio version of inside mma, I guess, although we talk a other combat sports as well. Mondays we drop the combat sports carousel, buzzy Bazuto, that's what it is. And then we do a routine and Ramallah, which is more us just riffing on pop culture events and try to add some positivity to try to find some good news stories to share in this deeply divided world of ours.

Speaker 4:          01:32:49       So yeah, we just uh, we enjoy working with each other and it's been a, uh, a blessing to be a reunited with them in here. You're a busy dude, man. Are you still doing boxing commentary as well? Debbie? Tupac pen and Glorious and well, maybe not so much shitty longer, although glory will always remain a very near and dear to me. But uh, so timing and did they were upset that I didn't go to Germany because I had a boxing event that night. Showtime is a first priority so we'll see. But, uh, but yeah, I'm, I'm doing a championship double header on Saturday at Barclays on showtime. Where a unification fight, which I think this year in boxing, because not a great year last year for the sweet science and uh, we're going to try to hopefully see more of the best fighting the best finally. And I think again, you know, people can say what they want about him, it may match making everything else.

Speaker 4:          01:33:37       But the one thing I've always liked about mma, eventually you will see those, the best fight, the best. And in boxing the politics and the money kept that from happening. Well that was the thing that kept fade or out of the UFC, you know, they wanted his own promotion. Yeah. They want to code promotion. We see how it helped us strike. I mean, I think everyone knows this by now. That was the deal that broke the proverbial camel's back with strikeforce. And showtime, uh, was the fader after he lost the, they, you know, wanted to resign fader at that amount of money. A showtime. The boss at the time said, you know, we need a fader or we're not going to renew the deal. And Doug strike forces owners, the sharks at the time with coker, uh, they wanted out. So that kind of set the ball in motion I think to because I thought and I think it would have still been very healthy for the sport.

Speaker 4:          01:34:29       I thought strikeforce and the UFC man, that was some good shows in strikeforce as we know. Look what the, the alum have done in the UFC. Amazing Organization, man. Yeah. Between strikeforce and in WEC. I mean there's been a quite a few champions that have come from both those elements and smart move by the UFC to, to do what they did to make sure they got exactly what I was. A very smart move. But there is something to be said for competition for sure. You know. And uh, I'm, I'm really. First of all, I'm glad there's other combat sports are getting more and more popular.

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       Like Bella tour. Take boxing liked glory to glory is a very, a very prevalent. We know, but you, you've helped push that needle as well. My man. And it's, I'm glad because I think for me, bud calling all these combat sports that we've called in this society in the 21st century, kickboxing at the highest level, I, I pick it over everything. It's one of the most exciting sports in the world for sure. Without a doubt. And one of the things about glory is that you know, you. This is, even though it's an organization that may be a lot of people have not totally become aware of. Sure. There's world class world, championship level talent. The talent is not like at a low level at all. When you got guys like Niki hold skin and you know what I mean, there's so much good. But it's again comes.

Speaker 3:          01:35:45       Okay, let me go. Why? Why do you think it? Everyone says we need American stars. Just like with you and you know everything. Is that. Why do you think Laurie is not making a bigger imprint right now in America? It's a good question. I wish I had the answer to because there's a lot of combat pilots already. I mean the doc would have how many shows they go to UFC. So if you look at all the other ones, but I don't know, I understand that or not. I think that's also very valuable to me. Nothing drives me more insane than hearing mma fans. Boo and incredible ground game or two athletes. So I'm just saying, hey, if there's that segment, there is this thing called glory. Kickboxing is on UFC fight pass to now. It's just I, I'm just a little surprised in a disappointed that it hasn't gotten a little more traction because these guys deserve it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:31       Man. It's weird. It's weird. I think boss nailed it though. I think there's too much to watch already. Well look, we do this for a living and I don't know. I'm, you're, you're, you're, you're watching everything. I can't keep up anymore when I'm on the road doing wwe and UFC and a single bed. Yeah. Like I'll, I'll watch. I have to tape everything just so fast forward and, and like you say to save time, Joan, it's, it's, you know, I can't, don't dedicate six hours because I only got two or three and I still want to follow in cover and yeah. And then if you want to file Moitai, good luck with all of luck with all that as well. Yeah, I mean there's just too many. Too much. You're writing what size? The hardest thing to watch in terms of like get it live on television paper for you.

Speaker 3:          01:37:11       I mean if some worldclass fights that are going on right now and there's no. There's a lot of times there's no way to get more type premier league remembering again was there all these. Nikki goes great, but boom, still owe me money. They do that. Of course they did. Somebody organizations only money. It is what it is. That was a good organization. They put together a good event rather than together a great event. And. But I think in the boycott was there were a couple corporate. Yeah, exactly. I think the world class more time worldclass a kickboxing or greatly. Greatly underappreciated. I think fight pass. I mean the ESPN deal. I think this helped a little bit and of course being on fight pass. I hope it was also. I mean, when I was doing the shows and keeping track of social media, you know, there is growth.

Speaker 3:          01:37:57       It's not, I don't think stagnated by any stretch of the imagination, but again, it's in Europe. It is, it is popular. Very good ratings, right? Uh, the Netherlands and by not an ultimate fighter of show, we've talked about that. Boxing. I asked anybody gives a fuck about those, those as well where we have a problem. Yup. You know, I think, I think people have seen too much reality TV. I think the novelty of it all wore off. I think when forrest griffin and Stephan Bonner went to war and season one and that whole, that whole cast with Kenny Florian, Diego Sanchez and it just, it, it was, it was something special. But then that was also before like the real housewives and a million different photos. That TV in general, like a member who wants to be a millionaire when the was on one night, 25, 30 million. That'll kick two nights, three nights.

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       It's like everything else we do in life when it's good or when it's successful. Let's keep going. Let's keep going until they run it into the ground. Yeah, and it's also, there's style, there's trends. People just get excited about certain trends. Then they get bored of certain trends and I think reality shows in general, I think it's hard for people to get excited about a new one. So if you had a new one is just about a bunch of kickbox almost got to be something more than what it would be something for either a fight or Netflix. You know, why you can watch it in one time. I think Netflix is the way to go nowadays because you decide when you want to write, not just netflix and Amazon. You've got a special on Netflix as well with everything, right? Like, uh, we're, we're then that's why to me kickboxing, grieving him at me.

Speaker 3:          01:39:30       You can go like on your phone right away. Here. Okay. I got three minutes. Boom. What a fight. Great stuff. Okay. I'm done. Like it's digestible in those tiny morsel. But how do you monetize it? How do you build a, uh, an audience that's consistent? Well, I think it's going to be a slow build. It's not going to be like the UFC, which kind of exploded, blow from the ultimate fighter and most sports don't explode like that. They take a long time and several generations to build a mma. It was so unusual in that it the excitement level from watching a high level of fight was irrefutable to the point where when people would watch fights on TV, they'd be so crazy and so exciting that it was almost like undeniable. Yeah, you had to watch him. He's just too many people watching. Can take your eyes off of it.

Speaker 3:          01:40:13       That's the difference between, I think kickboxing, it just. The gloves are bigger. They definitely ponds but doing that cage boy time. Yep, Yep. That's not a bad idea. It's a good idea, but then you know, you see it in a cage like, well, why can't he take them down? I can always do a flying arm bar. Yeah. That's fun. We can do a lot of things. Yeah, I mean I think the sport is still growing phases. I think as far as the talent level, you definitely seeing what's going on in women's mma. Women's MMA is changing pretty radically and quickly.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       Yeah. Yeah. We saw that.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       I mean, look at a water sitting in Paige vanzant for variety of reasons. Again, that's an eight. It's weird how our society, we're fixated the, you know, the good looking people who can fight are getting these huge numbers. Where shouldn't it just be in this sport? Okay. You're a fighter, you're talented fighter and I know for some, but it just seems like America especially is about the cosmetics, right? Well,

Speaker 5:          01:41:20       Sorta, but I don't know if that's totally fair. I think what we have is we have this giant pool of hardcore fans, right? Yup. Who want to watch a tyron woodley versus wonderboy too. They want, you know, people want to watch this really good fights. Exactly. There's that and, but in order to make the really big money, you got to go outside of those folks and yeah, get that casual fan and also generate interest in 100 percent of the hardcore fans because there's some hardcore fans that quite honestly, we'll look at a fire and go, you know, I don't really give a fuck about that fight for whatever reason that fights not my fight. I don't want to watch it. And so that's a big pay per view night for the UFC. There's a certain percentage of even the hardcore fans at it say, you know what, I feel better saving my 60 bucks and then I'll find out an hour later who want anyway. And unfortunately

Speaker 4:          01:42:07       time before Mcgregor came, it's always the lighter weight classes. Right? Yeah. And that's a shame. Here's the. Is the roster too big you think for the UFC in that respect? Like are you. Because even as we say, we covered this, we hardcore like it's, there's, there's a lot of fighters on the coil wire, you know, okay, this guy, the guy got to fill out the cards. I'm just wondering, for guy you covers a, does it works for the company, do you think there's the roster is it's too big or you're happy with the way it is

Speaker 5:          01:42:32       now in terms of Mike's fights? Right, so if I said that I would really have to do research before I save the rosters to big, but if they don't fight for if in this roster, the question then becomes where do they fight because they have to get fight somewhere and would it be better for some of these lighter? Not Lighter, but a lighter inexperienced guys like a Mickey Golf for instance, who just right away now he's fighting in the UFC and beat sage northcutts on Holy Shit. Now the kid's a star, right? He beats up on my phone because the smart so now, but he's also only a couple of fights into his career. If you were his manager and you cared about them a lot and you're saying, look kid, you're really good. He got real potential, but you need to get some seasoning and you need to get some seasoning and against commensurate talent. You know you want. You want to fight guys that offer a threat but that you can beat and you want to build your way up to a guy like Damien Maia. Right? But if you fight Damien Maia today, you're probably going to get fucking smushed good and you might get smushed in a way that might destroy your confidence for fucking years,

Speaker 4:          01:43:38       but then there's. I guess there's a feeder leagues, right? Access TV. What has done a good job? RFA, all these other groups. I'm wondering the UFC if they want to even invest to invest in something like that. Limited TV show of it now looking for

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       a fight so they. I don't think they will do that, but I always thought that they should do an amateur division or something to use an image of the vision. That's kind of cool because you're wind micky gall I think has potential to be a superstar, but if you're already. He already beat north. Y'all already been six. Northcott, Northcott. Who's going to fight next? Maybe barring Barberino. If he fights in, keeps winning like he's. He's not too far out of a top 20 ranked. Then all of a sudden you're in the wolves, Dan. I mean, maybe he's cool with that. Maybe. Look, Jon Jones did it. Yup.

Speaker 3:          01:44:23       How many fucking people are John Jones? Yep. No, you're right. When you get that kind of talent, that's how Jon Jones is a real special talent. That's really. It's undeniable takedowns. He hit on Dan Henderson pure grappling match. Oh yeah. He can do anything. That's what I like. He could submit you. He can knock you out. It's just. He really thinks about his fight in the coordinated for a guy that size under pressure. He's a fucking gym under pressure. He just rides the horse drawn. All right. Was that what was his arm is hyper extended. Vituro caught them in a beautiful arm bar. Perfect arm bar from the guard. Had a fully locked out. It looked like it looked like it was. Oh, it was over, but didn't panic. John just wouldn't, wouldn't tap. Let his elbow get fucked up and then went on to submit Vittorio. It's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:45:11       Well, you know, once, once you're a fighter and you slap on something and you think you got to do, you put all your effort in and then you lose it. It does a little bit to some fighters to their mental states, you know, they get depressed and then when you turn it up, you know it has the moment you want to start turning it up because then you destroyed a fighter. Then you can get actually to go for a submission. So I think that's what happened there. That was a unique fight too and that Jon Jones dropped Vittori with the front leg side kick to the body. I was like, that is a great technique for him because he's so long. You know, when you're seeing the way wonderboy uses it and some other folks use it and, and sage Northcutt as a really good one as well.

Speaker 3:          01:45:47       But you think those will bleak. I use. I have a feeling somebody is going to get hurt and they're going to take them out because it looks so dangerous. And especially the guy like Jones, again, because she got so much power on top of it, if by any chance the guy just walks backwards in his leg is stretched and he gets hit at that moment. Silva women with silk because there was a fight. I thought it would involve silverware. I thought the same thing like this is gonna end in a serious knee injury. He would do from lake side kicks to the knees. He would just hit you. I mean, why not the right above the knee? Just hyperextends you're neil. It's a weird thing because it's very effectively. So how come, how come you're allowed to round kick the outside of the knee? Which everybody does. You know, why you allowed to do that? But you're not allowed to hyperextend. I mean, if you're not there when it happens, you don't get hit or you, you know what I mean? It's one of those things. It's like, it is a very effective technique. Holly Holm uses it quite a bit, you know? Uh, she used it on Rhonda quite a bit in that fight. The lower low kick, I call it, you know, the little logo there under CAF. And who, who was it? Who broke his, uh, people are again,

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       if I was a pretty recent like three months ago or something, somebody broke his feeble because he got kicked in the calf and they stopped the fight. Now I'm thinking I'm the go to walk into it. Wasn't uc other organization, Huh? Yeah, I mean it definitely happens. What about knees to the head of a grounded opponent? Joe? Are you a fan? Well, or blue thing could, should be allowed. This is what I think. I mean, I think that if someone is shooting for a takedown, here's, here's a question. So like say if a guy is in the process of a double leg and someone's knee touches the ground, the guy shooting for that double leg, the knee touches the ground and as his knee touches the ground, you're opponent is already launching into a knee, a counter nate, which is the perfect technique for that position, right? What happens there should be, is that illegal? It should be. If someone shoots a total power double on you. And as they're sliding in their knees, hitting the ground and you catch them with a knee and put them out. Is that a need or grounded opponent? I mean, how does that work? Well, he slipped in. I would say that's the same as I hit you, but you turn your head at the moment. I hit you. I hit the back of your head.

Speaker 5:          01:47:56       Who are gaming the system? Remember when the guys would. They would just put that they have they. Yeah, that was just a little. But, but it's also like there was a controversial fight really recently with um, uh, Oliveira's and a 10 means tim and Tim means and Mark Ratner, we, I asked him when it was, he's only on one point at one point being one knee. I guess foot wasn't even on the ground like, and his other foot was up. Something like, is that legal? Like it was real confusing, confusing run. Mark Ratner said it should be legal. And I'm like, okay, well it's one point is illegal. And then John Macarthur said, no. He said it's not a point. He said like that, that expression that everybody uses three points more than three points, like two hands and two feet rather than a hand. It's illegal to hit person when they're down, but he says it's the bottom of your feet.

Speaker 5:          01:48:44       Anytime it's not the bottom of your feet are grounded opponent. So even if you have one knee on the ground and no feet like you're, you're just bouncing and moving towards, you're still a grounded opponent. Yeah. Yeah. Which is weird. That's weird. I'm not sure if I agree with that. No, I don't either. And and niche to the opponent on the grunt, I always scraped her knee. I think it's better then elbows and nowadays we see some knockouts with elbows and there's a lot of cuts and then you know, and you don't have to with the knee and evil. Well, no. So that's why I said it's easy. It's an easy defense once you know what going to be coming there. It's a bigger thing. You can just hold the thigh. I mean, but it's. I prefer it over lotion. Do you remember when Coleman used it and pride from Randall Road South position? Well, Ya know, those are just, I mean from sky high or just right to the. I mean it's a restaurant. One of the rest of the process moves because the wrestler, they'll, you know, if you're trying to shoot on them and they sprawl and they're on top that they have those needs right there. Boom, boom. It's

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       a tremendous technique for wrestlers. Remember Coleman? That was the beginning. The arms did it to Maurice. Maurice Smith. Mark Coleman. Fight with when headbutts were allowed. People forget that was nuts. But is it, is it so nuts? Why can't your head. But I just like how come you can use your elbow but you can't head. But why can't you art nine lymph node, right? I mean if you can cut someone with elbows, right? You're slashing across their face with elbows. Why can't you have. But because of the concussion thing, I don't know, but it's up to you. Right? I mean it seems like we were talking about the art of actual fighting. Sure. We know that a headbutt is a real martial arts technique. Yep. You know, I know why that is. And it was one of the reasons I would have bought somebody if there was a lot of audience, uh, when I was fighting at a club, if I had to fight, almost never fought for what you do because I just talked my way out though.

Speaker 1:          01:50:43       I would tell the people that you just nothing going on. But if I did, I used it on purpose headbutts because they look really insane and I will make sure that older people were watching that they would understand that, you know, we can't accept that kind of behavior that have bought, that will freak people out, you know? And I truly believe that's it's for, you know, for the sport to make the sport more attractive. Take the hell wants a normal person, watches the fight, like a comas thought, headbutting somebody into oblivion, you know, they're going to go, is this a sport? It looks, it looks really bad. It looks terrible. So to soccer kid. So I was going to say ground and pound for that matter. A lot of boxes and people had a hard time with people being on the ground and getting hammered.

Speaker 1:          01:51:26       Interested in the big problem. Once you're aware, tell you remember if they won the championship. That was scary. I mean, I don't know why the referee didn't stop the why he let him kick. I mean it was obvious he was. He was an a la La land use in Lala land and he got hit with the horrible soccer kick in. His whole body went flying. He was just dead out cold. Could have killed him. Well, and you know Rogers and a guy that should have been a superstar man cover of sports. There's a curse. The curse, the curse. He fell right into it and he's on the cover. Curse somebody thing. But athletes so mad and curse, the curse type thing. But that's also what they said about the UFC game. Cop gets on it. It is weird, crazy urban legend. The states that individuals and teams who appeared on the cover of sports illustrated magazine will subsequently be jinx. Well, it does it say anything in terms of what actual a result. How many pots. Look, there's touch folks. I couldn't even read this list. This list is fucking. It's

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       like everybody would ever to. You don't want to be on it. I believe we didn't think. Was that before the fight? Before the fight. Conor mcgregor. March fifth, 2016. Holy Shit. Go West side. Jake's. He was scheduled to fight how us on Joseph. Then dos Anjos fell apart with a broken foot. Dos Anjos is going up to me to a welterweight. That's interesting. Very interesting. I love how he, how he feels good without uh, cutting so much weight. He's a big fella. Everybody. Everybody when they fight they fight so much better. But then whoever. Does everyone do that? I think yeah. For, for a lot of reasons. You should fight closer to a solution. Do you think there's a way that they can make guys way their natural weight? Like test them the same way they test for like drugs? Test them for hydration. Like show up.

Speaker 5:          01:53:37       Hey Maura, we're going to just put you on a scale today and find out what you actually will moral you. Fight 1:55. You weigh one 86. What the fuck's going on dude? Yeah man. Get in shape. Get in shape and tell us when you're ready and what you actually weigh. And so then when you find out that the guys in shape and you're actually, you go your, your, your shape, you're in, you're ready. Okay? Okay, well it says here you weigh one 75. There you go. Okay, now we're going to check your hydration levels. Oh, well you're dehydrated though. Okay. We're going to get you to the normal hydration level. This is argued. Now you're healthy. You're one 79. Okay? This is what you weigh. One hundred 80 pound fighter. Yup. And just decide whether or not you want to fight. And if you do, this is what you fight at.

Speaker 5:          01:54:16       Or if you want to weigh less, you got to have to lose some weight, but you can prove that you actually way that you know, like lose all the body fat. Get yourself to a good position. You know? Okay, so what are you at now? You're at will? I've got myself down to one 70 way. I'm okay. Looks like you're actually one 70 and look, check your hydration. Your healthy. Okay. So this is your real weight. You fight one 70. Perfect. I mean how many guys? My weight class of course, and that's unfortunate, but for the goiter was established for the greater good. I like that you said it already at the beginning of the old ways. They blame other people. Fighters, you know, and if there's nobody to blame, they blame the fact that their opponent was cutting more weight so he was stronger in the fight.

Speaker 5:          01:54:59       That's why I lost. No, you lost because you lost. You didn't lose because she weighed five pounds. Sex. I look at the old days, man, let's forget what Frankie. He, everybody will. You just won 55. 18. He didn't cut a goddamn out one and he's beating everybody. But that's, that's, that's the problem. And they got and they shocked for focusing on it and at least because they can give it a reason. And then let's hope that the main events, we've lost shows and we will lose sight. Chris Justino, I mean, what is her weight? What is the most healthiest? She's think that's true. That's true. So Bonnie, she's bigger than that. I agree with you. I don't think if she, if it's that much of a struggle, she's almost done outside of to make 1:40 1:45 is a bruised street with 1:50 5:55 is a real weight class. There you go. So, well maybe it's not for her, but you know, I'm hearing that she's even heavier than one 75. She's way over one 80 shift. Gabby.

Speaker 5:          01:56:01       Gabby slows down their friends. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean I've, I wish there were more weight classes for men and for women. You know, I wish there was a ton of weight classes in boxing. I think. Yeah. The one thing that boxing has the people don't like is that they have so many champions. You have too many weight classes, but that's how you make things fair. You're right, you've got like you can't have a one 85 and then a two. Oh five. That jump is huge. Twenty five to 65, 20 stakes, 20 pounds. Take Twenty one ounce or 16 ounce t bone steak and stack them up and imagine that someone has that advantage over you. If it's in his belly, it's okay to 35 week class, we need that. I think you're right. Or 2:25, 25 maybe at 2:45 and then unlimited. You know, who knows, but I think that having heavyweight where there's a weightless, you can't weigh more than two 65.

Speaker 5:          01:56:51       That seems crazy because they had a been what? 80 a day of the fight will look and then you're struggling. You can, you can go to two. Oh five to 20 and you have a really hard gut and then you face a guy who's do 85. Although the early morning thing I guess has been successful right? The day of the. Now it's successful. Radically unsuccessful. There's been 17 different people missing weight like one or two in the same time. So then what's this? Why is that then just because they want to get the edge, the safety, safety, it gives people more time to rehydrate themselves, but the problem is it gives them less time to lose the weight. Right? So if you're starting off early in the morning, like if you're, if your weigh ins or at 4:00 and you know you're not going to eat all day, you're going to lose weight all throughout the day, but if you're way answered at 8:00 in the morning when you're getting up, you're going to lose all that weight.

Speaker 5:          01:57:44       You know, you might not, you might not lose enough weight. So people were miscalculating including. There's definitely a lot. There's definitely an issue with people cutting too much weight. There's definitely an issue with people doing it unhealthy Sunday be punished or penalized even more though, like I just recently heard Gospel 30 percent of his wealth and that's what, okay, that, that's fine. But even Calvin Gospel when they admit, yeah, I haven't really been looking after my died. Right. You're a professional athlete signed to the. The biggest organization in the world did. Shouldn't that be part of the contract that in if you're fighting for us that you have to maintain, you almost have those. I instead of even a random drug tests, random random way to obviously they made calvin go up to one 85. Yes. Next fight. And what's crazy is he looked fucking insane and Tim Kennedy blew his entire, was trying to take him down and beat him up. And the earlier, the first round, I mean, he, he, he showed his size advantage, his strength advantage. He's a massive, uh, like he's

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       a massive powerhouse when it comes to his ground and pound his Jujitsu. But Calvin just stayed the course, the defense. And then eventually when he got on his feet, man way to swift and it's, how many times does he know? Three just missed a bunch of times he missed against Tyron Woodley and tyron and beat him. And tyrone as a gentleman, decided yes, even take his money. Remember the which is a very fucking ethical and moral move by the champ. Now the current champ. So he lost that. And I mean there was more than one fight in the past for that. But you wouldn't, you say. Okay. Again, not because he's a great fighter, like you're saying. Very good. One 85. So let's hope. Okay. Stays. But if Mrs Wade, you should take a year. You can, you know, put the fear in them and then they really going to do.

Speaker 3:          01:59:26       I think Calvin should fight at 85. I think he could when he could. When it 70. I think he can make 70 but he doesn't always make sense or you're right one. Yeah, I mean unless he wants to lose a ton of body fat and then try fighting at one 70, you know, really clean his diet up. Really go down the bricks. Donnie Henderson does not seem like the same person. Oh what it. Because of Thompson wrecking them the way. But I agree because I heard you say as well, even though like physically did not look physically. No, he doesn't look like he works as hard. It doesn't look like he is as motivated. He doesn't look as hungry. His vaunted knockout power is gone. Gone, gone. Great. Weird, it's weird. Yeah, I, I wanted him and I said a long time ago if I was just coaching with his tie his left hand through his body and it put them after every workout.

Speaker 3:          02:00:13       You go three or four rounds on the back, you know, just using your right hand Kale. Imagine if he developed a right hand on top of that. I mean because it was 90 percent was left, you know, you would, that you open a whole new door, you know, you know, and it's an unfair to question someone whether or not they tested positive for anything. If they took anything, if you haven't tested positive. So he never tested positive for anything. So you can't look at it that I don't think he did. Did he know maybe a diuretic or something. Maybe. Maybe find out if Johnny Hendricks ever tested positive for something. I don't think he did. So you know, there's a lot of people throwing accusations about him and George St Pierre was. But you know what it costs will be one of the things he said about his last fight, he said he worked out four times a week, week one time, four times a week.

Speaker 3:          02:00:56       He's like, he just was not focused on that fight. If that's the case, you've got to get. That's why he looks like that has nothing to do with Usada or anything else. He just doesn't have the hunger. And that's it. And that's where you, you put yourself at great risk, but also mentally going into the fight. If you know that another guy trained 10 times a week and you're trained for what are you going to do it for? It's just weird that his power went away. I mean he used to make ice crumble. He used to let me know when he hit John Fitch and went flying, Martin Kampmann flying, went flying. It was like he had magic in his hands and then all of a sudden it stopped. So what the fuck really just ruined him. Yeah, he. Yeah. And you fucked him up and he fucked him up with like using that front leg side kick.

Speaker 3:          02:01:42       And then the front leg round kiss would he hit a bad one to the body and then johnny leg nods his head like you got me. And then slap the same one right up to the face. And that's the thing with water boy, he makes it. Oh yeah. Perfectly. And then it suddenly a hook a get a question mark and it's every time it's a different cake, you don't know what's going to come. Mr Berger Talk Shit about him. All the spinning kicks. It's a waste of energy. So. Oh, for real. This shit out. I don't think it's a coincidence city. We'll kicked ellenberger in the head twice. Here's your waste of time, dude. Yeah, it's not, it's not a waste. It's some fucking super good at this. But Greg King, conor Mcgregor too, right? He's using a lot more. But the kitchen like him during the more to measure the whole the opponent at bay and then suddenly his his hand.

Speaker 3:          02:02:29       So the left turn lane. The Guy Man, he's one of my favorite guys to watch. Also be outside of fighting. Get the way he talks. He never has the same like with me with interviews where people ask, you know about your life, how it started. Well, it, it's, it's the same story over and over again. Well, he can. He can make it every time. He's one of those guys that constantly changes. Smart businessman. Oh, smart. Smart is. He's the best shit talker in the history of combat sports. Before that it was chill son into Mohammed Ali and now it's conor mcgregor. He just knows how to fucking say it. Jeremy Stevens starts talking to him. He goes, the guy just destroyed them with one sentence. I mean, it's, he's, he finds the perfect shit. You say. The way he looked back.

Speaker 3:          02:03:22       It's hilarious when he went in there and dilated Eddie Alvarez like that. You just gotta go, fuck man. He's any of that style of sliding out and sliding in. It's a very unusual, almost a karate based style with like sitting down on vicious punches on the end of it, you know, but you don't hit stamps and because she's a soccer ball. But I, I thought, you know what, with the. Although if I was all those coach a year ago already, I would have said when we go to trey South Pole and you because there's no way he can block those low kicks if left, there's no way he can block them because his stance is too white and his knees are pointing to the again, 100 percent. The whole game changes the whole game and his left low kick by the way. Look. Although could kick the fuck out of you with either low or right.

Speaker 3:          02:04:13       Wow Man. Yeah. Yeah. He, he, he made me think of for Ramon dekkers, Ya know, that explosive. Oh Man. His law will. They call the Duchy left to the body and then right leg kicked behind it. Chad Mendez. I was like, whoa. Though he throws it man. I think although and Max Holloway's have very interesting fight that fight. So it has to. It has happen. I keep hearing all this crazy shit like Aldo my go up and fight a bead for the interim title and I'm like, God damn it. You got to have a fight at 12. There we go again. Right. The money you weight fights, everyone already even talked about mcwane instead of staying in their way instead of defending the title they own. I mean it's obviously not as big a fight is him fighting Nijmegen madoff in Russia. Right. And especially if they fight for a 55 pound title, they've never gone out fights in Russia and they might have to fucking build a new soccer stadium.

Speaker 3:          02:05:10       I don't think people understand. Anytime I post something on Instagram, I get 150 fucking Russian dudes who write Habib time and then they just pulled her beep time with the credit side. My fucking credits are overrun with people that say aura, not credits, comments. Overrun with people say Habib time, Habib time. Fucking just for safety. When they're building that thing, make an underground tunnel for when he loses his straight to the airport. Like if you fight conor. You know what's interesting about the conor fight, man, lack Habib time. Habib time. See? Oh yeah, yeah. He's not fucking around. It's all true. But like, um, if he fights connor, we, Michael Johnson cracked him and rocked him. I went, oh boy, he did get angry and he beat the fuck out of them, but the point is he got hurt, he got hurt, and if connor catches you like that, you might be fucking Donesville.

Speaker 3:          02:06:00       He might drop some hammers on you and that might be the same thing. Right. The we've seen caught her as well at times. It's just the bet habibs defense. We saw conor get rocked against nate and you wind up losing that fight. Shortly thereafter Habib got rocked and it's Michael Johnson came back stronger. Yeah, dominated him. So it was the only time. I mean, it's when you see a guy with his dominant is a Habib, you start looking for weaknesses in his arm. It's the only time we've seen any weakness at all. But uh, Greg, in his defense, he was getting tired already there.

Speaker 3:          02:06:33       Yup. Yup, Yup, sure. Would that be. Doesn't get tired. Did you see that funny video to habit to narrating guy who's constantly dropping f bombs leftover? I tell a story about how bp they always training and where you coach from, no one was six years old. He was already wrestling with fricking bears and it's really funny. It's. It's on here right now somewhere. Do you know what the name of the show? A hobby. A Hobby Promo. Just put that on trusting man of the world title. It's lately made so it will pop up and pop. I guess it's really funny. Nice. And you see them wrestling a bear. A bear when he was six years old and then he starts talking about his father who was already a really. But that's the other thing. Judo Guy MMA and sample reports. The memes. The use of social media get so cool man. Well the. Unless you Ronda Rousey's Nunez fight or should come in so many fucking people. You know what those mean? What do you, what do you think she's coming back? No, I don't think she. I mean

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       I don't think. I don't think if she does, she should come back in a calculated manner. Like don't just rush in and fight for the title like she did. I think that's crazy. Taking a year off, getting head kick, knocked out, you know? Where's your head out? And was she 100 percent committed to this as far as like training for the entire time off? Or did she just get in really good shape over the last few months and had she been training at all before then? I mean, you'd have to ask her and answer all those questions, but if she doesn't want to be fighting, she shouldn't be fighting,

Speaker 4:          02:08:08       you know, but you know from the beginning of movement head movement. So I assumed they worked on the hand movement. I just think the pressure and the way she comes to the angry phase and all that shuts her down and, and you know, it's still much pressure. A whole Hollywood career writes on it. I mean that's not gonna happen now, right? I mean, because buddy was a tool. We talked about no footwork, no defense thing, but that's what nurses can do to you. I would like to see a Rhonda with a smile on her face, go tutoring, being relaxed and calm, send her away, go to a Duane Ludwig for a year and have some smokers because she can still legally do that. And other clubs. Just striking, you know, to, to just get in that moment that to see where you went. I think in training, this is the problem that everybody has, you know, in training, you always do good.

Speaker 4:          02:08:53       A lot of guys do good, but you know as well as I do that as these gym guys are really good in training, they can do it on a pressure. So if she's been boxing and working on a striking and she's been hitting people left, they're right there. They got some good people coming in. I heard that she works out even with boxing champions are champions and doing well against this. But then again, you know that that's a nice safe environment. Bringing it under pressure with all the crap she had on her shoulders. I thought it's also takes it away. New is a very, very dangerous punch. Sod In strikeforce kicks right away, her kicks or punches and kicks and punches so fucking hard and she has long arms man and she puts you on the end of these long punches and cheat. Dinged Rhonda very early in the fight and you could tell she was rock.

Speaker 4:          02:09:38       She goes right back into the whole fight. That's what I think happened. And, and Nunez also leans all the way over, so it's hard to take her down, you know, and run. That should also, you know, and maybe she's doing it, I'm just saying what I don't see, you know, maybe stock wrestling over a small intel because a girl like that, but so much talent, she'll pick that up so fast. But if she suddenly suits for a singer or don't, but she'd already been rock. So I think that because remember she's shocked her off clenches. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:10:03       his upper body couch and she always reaches him with the left arm. It's like this, you know Greg Jackson, I talked about it after the Holly Holm fight that they had seen every single one of her fights. She comes at you, she got that left arm, extended, tries to get ahold of girls with left arm hip, tosses them, gets them on the ground, armbars on. And they just were. So

Speaker 4:          02:10:20       that was going to say, interesting that home shifting from mma, from boxing Dema just trained for Ronda Rousey fight. Cody car brand. Remember Shit as a kickboxing, kickboxing, and boxing champ, but I'm saying in terms of our MMA prep, the goal was Ronda Rousey right

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       and now with cody garbrandt he talked about in high school, Dominick Cruz. And you think you wonder, well, the, the laser focus, right? The television, obviously you have to work on everything, but if that's your target and you see what he did to cruise it, well there's a lot of fighters like that that attract greatness. Like I think Anderson Silva attracted greatness and I think one of the reasons why Weidman became as great as he was because he knew that Anderson Silva was at the top of the mountain. Can you see that? That, that assassin, you know, and Weidman caught him like right at the right time and you know, knocked them out and then the broken leg and the second fight and it. I think when you have a dominant champion like Anderson was for so many years, all those young kids coming up, that's who they aspire to and raises the bar like I want.

Speaker 3:          02:11:15       I'm really curious to see what the flyweights look like in a few years. Yes. Because of how good mighty mouse is because his bar, he's raised it so it's way above everybody else. But yeah, but, uh, you know, and associate for getting to coastal planning for two feet next to each other, having no for backwards site and we'll let her will move with whatsoever you can only lean as much backwards. Right for that left hook he received from Weipa and well, you know, when he fought Weidman, it had a very clever move that a lot of people missed. And what he did was he threw a right hand and then behind the right hand threw, he threw a back fist so there was a, a punch coming from the left and then he moved towards it and another punch coming towards left because it was a left hook because the Anderson is doing is bobbing and weaving stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:11:55       But when a punch comes out, um, and then a backfill, he's got to go that way up. So then he's got to go that way. So when he went back, right, that's when Chris Weidman cracked him with that long left. That's the same punch that he used to knock out your rial hall. He throws this long straight armed hook and it's very deceiving how much distance you can cover with it, you know? Yeah. A lot of distance. Plus it sent straight spot. Straight punches are better as well. I always say, you know, that's why I always liked to use clotheslines. Yeah, I mean you have more reach. If you connect with a left hook, you'll wait to see if the person doesn't move your weight, your close for a straight punch. But if you make it a palm strike, now we have some space that we can cover.

Speaker 3:          02:12:32       What did you think a Yoel Romero knocking out Weidman was not insane. Why did, why did white men even wanted to go for that? I mean, he had the whole training camp. He said, I don't what she said, I have no clue. I did it because we, we knew we should not do that. And as soon as she lowered himself, it was. Yeah, it just glided. There's just a perfect knee because he was doing freaking awesome. We did exactly what I said in the game plan, and you'll go, go, go. It doesn't matter if he keep him down, take him. They'll get all those muscles working. I'm trying to get them tired. Uh, and it was working for him until you're well decided to wrestle with them. And then he was thrown Weidman around that second round. That's when you realize how strong a wrestler he is, how good his wrestling. Another saying, the wrestling of the high level, Olympic caliber and get our to dangerous dudes. That's why he's the freak of all free stands next to all of them. It just looks like what in the fuck did they feed you in Cuba? But the same thing with him. Can you imagine if he starts focusing

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       on the right side a little bit more? What a super freaked his guy is going to be because all those attacks are coming to left leg, left knee, left straight, pretty much the only way time when he uses the right look, he gets to set up a straight punch or kick or whatever. And he doesn't throw with power, you should counter that, that right kick that distros outside lack or inside leg, whatever statute. But you should counter that instantly because otherwise the big hand is going to come. But if he starts developing a right and a right kick, just do things so right near right who, whatever he is, he too muscular and I know it's late for you. But that's what I'm saying. But it's like

Speaker 5:          02:14:07       you look at a guy like that because you save physical specimen man, just so incredibly, uh, above and beyond, but yet, okay, it's working for him while he's humble Johnson. Yep. So it's definitely not a problem. It just has to manage it. Like in a lot of ways, the same way tyron woodley uses his power. He's obviously much more muscular, much stronger than most guys in that division. And he showed the wonderboy fight, the Woodley knows how to manage it. And I came out, he went full five rounds. And what's really important is that he stunned wonderboy and the fourth. So they're in the championship round, still rocked him and hurt him bad and had them in deep, deep trouble. So I feel like there's so many benefits to being as powerful as Yellow Romero is. There's definitely a downside. The downside is if a guy like Weidman didn't shoot for that and was constantly wearing on him, constantly grinding on him and had him in a bit of trouble, like Tim Kennedy had been his second round, then you know, we'll see what happens.

Speaker 5:          02:15:03       It hasn't happened yet. I mean even in the Kennedy fight, he definitely cheated. Right. You definitely saw that and, and he was tired, but they still at knockout power, he's still recovering. I still came back to fuck Kennedy and it was like, Jesus Christ, he's such a monster. He's so. He's so much better of an athlete than almost anybody else in the division. When he throws guys around, he just, they could just go sailing. Or guys who. I've always been impressed with a guy who mean the guy with the striking to me and he well fucked him up to hit him with that spinning back fist and hit them all. All hurt. Came back from that fight in one good thoroughbreds mare. A lot of great fights and what know know Yoel Romero one, he wanted the decision but the cision was overturned because of the drug. So yeah, he had some sort of peptides that they found in the supplement that he was taking. So they only gave him like a nine month suspension was Saint Joe's took

Speaker 2:          02:16:11       for understanding. That's why I don't watch to me was like, that was kind of weird because he is managed by.

Speaker 5:          02:16:16       No, definitely not. Okay. I thought that. No, no, no. He had some growth hormone thing inside of it. Whereas Jones had clomifene. Clomifene is, uh, an estrogen suppressor that people use, kickstart their testosterone production after a steroid cycle. It's an extra burden. Estrogen rather, um, suppressing the first one who brought actually the product that he says, this is what I looked into it and that's what I never. I always said that the older fighters say, but nobody, if I would be, the guy would say this is what it took police test is, and he said, are you a proponent like cut? A lot of people say why? What do supplements actually do for the the, the athlete if this is what's been happening with attendance where you get your supplements from there. The real issue with supplements is some of them definitely work, you know, I mean, how much should you be allowed to enhance your body with nutritional supplements?

Speaker 5:          02:17:08       Right? Because there's a lot of supplements at work. Creatine works is a lot of stuff that works, so you have to figure out like, okay, well how much can it work? You know, it obviously can't work like Andrew on or all those hormone precursors that they've all band. Okay, well it can't work that good. Can it work as good as this? And then like there's all these different, you know, standards. I mean there's, there's certain protocols that people follow when ti comes of it turns to have a vitamin replacements and they do ivy vitamin drips and extreme concentration on their nutrition and they have results. Those results, they, they tend to show that there are benefits in supplementation and there's definitely benefits and clean diet and making sure that your nutritional balances. So like at what level should it be illegal? You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:17:54       You can't. How you found the fuck. Are you getting so much? Be Twelve out of nature. They're not. You have to take it in a pill. Then it gives you energy. Well what the fuck is that? And you could take some caffeine like Chael Sonnen, he used to take caffeine pills to make sure that he got the exact amount of caffeine because he's like, you don't know because you get a starbucks, you might get a Venti starbucks and they might've fucking packed it in tight and chews the shit out of it and you can get a cup of coffee like coffee. So it might actually test over. So in order to make sure that jail was in the the lines, he would take pills. Caffeine is illegal. It's sort of lifts legal. Illegal. Yeah. But if you get to a certain number, it's illegal. Okay. If you get past a certain amount of milligrams in your system, I don't know how they mentioned that.

Speaker 5:          02:18:39       That's the other thing that testosterone, deputy testosterone or talk to medical professionals and everyone saying men you produce supposed to be around one took one. That's all. Yeah. Unless you're some weird freak, you might be like one to two. Okay. So four to one or six to one. How does that, you know, that's always been. What about is wanting to learn and for injury recovery, Joe and I know a lot of people. Fighters. That's what they said. Well Geez, I had a mortgage. I have to fight. I got to support the family. Is there a way to monitor that where even though the band steroid thing where you can allow a person to at least make a living without making it an enhancement? Well, it's going to be an enhancement. That's the problem right away. When is he going to be an enhancement, but if you take steroids while you're like say if you have a knee surgery and then he takes steroids and then you're lifting weights the entire time, so you're going to keep some of those games, you're going to keep a certain percentage of it, but on the flip side, your endocrine system is going to be fucked up and it's going to take you a while to get back to normal testosterone production.

Speaker 5:          02:19:40       If you do end up testing and you do go back on Usada after the injury. So there's an argument so that you're taking a risk, you do recover quicker, but it might not be better for your overall hormone system. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:19:52       You know, I remember I was talking about it, we did it on the podcast. I don't, I don't memorize have it memorized, but there was a test but testosterone, what they did in the Olympics, Bri, Bri, uh, steroids and after steroids and they start really testing biological passport and they say that it actually did not help that more people who didn't use had better results than the people who were using. And it was same thing as me. I get that face, what you have now, two analysts, but uh, you know, I'll look it up and you know what I'm saying,

Speaker 5:          02:20:23       whenever the Russians are doing whatever they're doing to do it because they got a fucking state sponsored program, you know, United States is working hard to try to clean it up. I mean they have baseball players have to go in front of Congress. They arrest people, people getting locked up. You saw to jeff and Wicki cron up everybody's ass. We're trying to find people that are still steerer using steroids and cheating and Russia now like, what are we going to like? Candy? Let's fucking make it happen. You need to be faster. The stuff that I got from a horse, stick it inside your body and see if you become a horse. Crazy tests in the early days. Also we'd like making super soldiers in injecting people with like plutonium, like a live person. This is what happened. If he'd like the freaking Wolf Hall and they watched so many comic books.

Speaker 5:          02:21:14       I mean they, they almost kicked the entire Russian Olympics the Olympics. The Olympics in Brazil, they were like, Hey, what the fuck? At the last minute they decided not to, but they've been going back, you know, they use the old samples from 2008 and 12 and they've already kicked out to a Russian Olympic gold medalists in wrestling. They were on the shit. They're on the shit that just on this undetectable shit or some shit that they don't detect yet. Which of course, and when you see him. Oh yeah. I mean lifting straight from you, like the sport. Is it ever going to be clean? Well, it's way cleaner now in the UFC that it's ever been before, but I think there's also. I liked the fact that one fcs available for guys who don't want to be clean. Yeah. Risings available for guys who don't want to be clean. You know, there's an argument either way, there's an argument for the pride way, which was everybody knew that everybody was on it. Tested pride. Right. Hey boss, what's this? Why is this a viable? Just civic here. I mean, buddy, I did this thing believable decoder, the boss to her. I was going backstage with the camera showing everybody, hey man, what's up here? You don't look there spending training

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       and you know, and then I say okay, we walk into the room from the doctors. So I opened the door and I looked at the side and I see all the protests there with little sticks on them. Right. And I closed the door right away to look into camera. I said, give me one moment to the very busy, let me walk in and ask for permission. So I walk in and I grabbed one of those cups and I see green tea or fill it up and it put the same cup next to it. So then when you weren't even allowed to be that close. So yeah, yeah, she, she, I could have contaminated everything. So I'm walking in and I'm saying, oh, these had a doctors here and they looked at us and go, Oh hey, the tests. I said, man, wouldn't it be great if you can taste

Speaker 5:          02:23:02       what fighter it is? And these people, they looked at me and so I take my green tea

Speaker 2:          02:23:10       and I take the thing off. And they go like, no, no, no, no, no, no, take a little sip. And I said, I go

Speaker 5:          02:23:17       coleman or freaking gold. There was a clear illustration, obviously. Serious. Yeah, not water, you know, it's been real open about it and talked about like they literally said in large prints, we do not test you forest

Speaker 2:          02:23:40       thing, you know, I, I knew a guy from there and he would say to me that in the morning he would take a huge runs of

Speaker 5:          02:23:47       testosterone because it made him really angry in the morning. That jacked up once far. And Andy, what about these guys who were like bench pressing the day before, you know, all these muscles

Speaker 2:          02:24:00       guy. So when they got in, you know that you have the white dude. I have these guys because of the cosmetic thing. Pride would love to the freaks, my man. And that's a, you know, a lot of matchmaking

Speaker 5:          02:24:11       guys. Remember Jason Chambers from, he went over to Japan, I forget which organization was that? They, they want him to fight one 85 and he's like, wait one 70. And they're like, don't worry, we'll get you on this title. He wanted him to juice up and go to one 85. And he was like, what in the fuck?

Speaker 2:          02:24:32       That's the problem. You know what? But people say he, they say they should just allow it. I say yeah, but then you force the guys who want to stay clean to use it as well. And you shouldn't. Joel mentioned earlier, I mean the health, there are health risks risks, but I think not even health risks, I think it doesn't damage your, your

Speaker 5:          02:24:49       system when you do steroids. Well it depends on how much you're doing, but if you're, if you're going like super hyper human levels, like I'm sure a lot of those guys were a yes for you. And it's one of the real clear indicators that a lot of guys were on it were how they got off of it and came to the UFC and looked like models. They look like cumin pitbulls right away with a lot of them. Yeah. I'm a lot of them. I mean, it's just, it is what it is and it's a. unfortunately the early roots of mma were marred like it's, it's almost all people that took steroids. I mean, there's so many camps. If you talked to the insiders, they will tell, God dammit, back then everybody was on, everybody was on, you know, and you don't have to name names and everybody who knows knows and it doesn't matter, but what does matter is that when you look at the early days of the sport, it was insane, essentially contaminated and now they've wiped out a giant percentage of it and occasionally guys still get caught with some things and you know, Cyborg got caught with a, some sort of quick.

Speaker 5:          02:25:45       Yeah. That's also spironolactone is also a dht inhibitor. It's dihydrotestosterone, which is a derivative of testosterone which makes your hair fall out and I used to use that spironolactone stuff that she got caught with. I used to rub that shit in my head to keep my hair from falling out.

Speaker 1:          02:26:02       Yeah, boss. I'm taking notes. I feel like I'm studying under professor Rogan right now. This is amazing, but

Speaker 5:          02:26:09       it's also used by people who want to shield themselves from tests. It's also used by females that have taken male hormones and they want to reduce the effects of the extra androgens. Yeah, so there's a lot of. A lot of factors.

Speaker 1:          02:26:23       Yeah. Once they start growing hair, I think, and getting all this, we would see guys come in just that you can tell right away, Bang. A chick and you see Werewolf back here. Well, they say to us can be as big as a thumb. Right? That's what they say though. Yours. My girth is less like pop sap bad. The worst story. I've heard some guy I was talking, I'm not gonna mention names and he said, and we were talking about that at a. I go, uh Oh man. That's got to be. That's got to be really horrible. Oh No. I had one. I did a body builder and then she had like a big thing I do. What did you do? He said, oh, I shucked it.

Speaker 1:          02:27:12       Isn't that funny? Look, we're all good with sucking clip. As long as they're little little, but I don't care if it feels good for you, if it's. If I feel it more than a half an inch into my mouth is on fire, even though it's a woman's vagina, but if it comes with the accompanied voice, the dark voice, when you do a Netflix special, a good tourist back here, I'm not dying motherfucker. You are going to be by far the fathers. There's got to be guys who are just really into being dominated by super powerful women with big cliffs kind of people. Yup, Yup. Absolutely. Yeah. Some guys are listening right now. Go. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's my stuff. Do you

Speaker 5:          02:28:08       think that when you guys look at rise and right now, do you think the rise in has the possibility of coming here, putting on some fucking big shows. They've got some good fights, you know, cro, cop, just ones that heavyweight tournament, you know, you're shaking your head over there. I think they have a of success.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       It's hard to do. Again. They go to neat after Sakharova stopped pride, parade much went to start going to a star. That's the thing. Exactly. You know, you have seen it with the gay one. That was the reason [inaudible] stopped at certain time. There was no more Japanese star and they need a good one or a fight is going to beat for Gracie's right there. That's something that's, that's a one in a lifetime deal. What came Masato and the lighter weight was a superstar. He will mix. Yeah, I came one Max, but then we'll get up to your bigger guys when to, once you get a guy like potter Hari size, it's just not who the fuck is going to be that big, you know, how that fight in her heart and rico very climactic but broke his arm but still interesting fight what was going on and I'm excited about a rematch.

Speaker 1:          02:29:06       So he might be wanting to come back as well. And a boy. Yes. But against 40. Right. These guys are. I just met the Madison Square Garden for the, uh, for the wheelchairs. The fighting a December 31st Monday. Was there his trainer when you're on skis and uh, but he, he didn't say anything. He, he sat, you know that actually I met the guy who remembers champions. He sat and he said [inaudible], but he didn't say anything more. Seventy shelter to retire because of the heart conditions. Are those by de? Yeah, it's. So you see if a guy like uber, uhm, like back when he was ubering and when he was winning one 65 super jacked and then he goes to mma. But you know, Guy Wins The k Grand Prix. Like you gotta wonder like a guy like ubereats, if he came back as ubereats, you know, like I don't know if its glory or Bella tour, whoever, whoever has got the stones in the cash to pull them aside and said, listen fella as work to be done here.

Speaker 1:          02:30:06       Yes you can. They would love to do it. The Diet that the horse meat, this is my friend. He's from another country and he is a doctor. She will help you. They will make you better, stronger, faster. Comes back again, man. Back when he knocked out, bought her daughter with a complete animal. Belong. I want to see him. That night I broke down. That was the one time in all the fights and everything we've seen and I remember I was there, wouldn't have Jose, a pelly and John, so it gets Brian gasaway in Canada. John Mccarthy and I broke his leg, but for some reason, Saki and Spong, I was broke down just to see because it first, it was so visceral and all of this, everything that it took for him to come back and put it in and then pull them down was crazy because tyrone's bong and him are both super high level. Kickbox is. You only really saw that mostly in mma. I really didn't see it that much. A high level kickboxing and that's why we talked there is now. I mean Matt embry, this kid from Canada who's now a, are going to be fighting in Los Angeles next week. There's Canada to where the sport is banned in so many of the provinces. But Joseph, valvoline, he had

Speaker 3:          02:31:19       to retire because of the concussion issues. Um, place on next week. Awesome. He's a smart kid, man. He's a great guy. He, I don't think he's 100 percent decided on his retirement, but he's leaning towards that. That's either concussions a, not something you want to. You want to mess with. Remember Tj grant? Yup. He was exactly. Benson had the title and a lightweight division never kept saying never came back and from concussions I just pumped up. Pit Bull. It was people who broke his shin. It was in the military. Oh, that's right. That's right. That bone in the next two. We should. People are. People love whatever it is. Yeah. It's interesting also that like we know we're talking about kickboxing, not really gaining ground in America. Ballot tourism really gain ground either though, you know, it's, it reaches a certain point in some of the ratings were really good.

Speaker 3:          02:32:10       Like when Kim Shamrock, those freak show, Meryl Streep or Scott, there is a promoter. Always has been, always will be in. I mean he, there's that mix where I think Bella tour has to focus on because you have to see for the large part, 98 percent, 99 percent of the best talent, but Bella toward trying. But you're right, and again, I think it's also because Joel, we talked about too much of everything [inaudible] it's every week something. The UFC did it as well. At first they got to have to fight us underneath the fight. By having so many show, she shut every hug a organization. But then you look at guys, a few guys in Beltour like Lima who just knocked out course golf, which is fuck this world class, terrific fighter. Martin, Marla, I mean world series of fighting. Even man, there's Marlon Moraes guide sheet we talked about, was it for me?

Speaker 3:          02:33:06       For me too many times he got lit up to win that fight. He won, but he got hit too many times. He really needs to stay. Change his game. He knows she can take a punch, but he thinks too much advantage of it and I just don't think it's that. What are the goals? Respect. Like realistic, like you say, like even belt Torres and got traction. So how do there, how did they continue to exist? It is, it is hard because they've been around for a long time now. World series of fighting for a long time now and the hardcore hardcore fans and then you break it down, not even regular heart rate, hardcore hardcore are watching those events. It's almost like we're spoiled. We have too many and it's weird to say because how many years did we fight? Hey, look at us now. It's like, wow, a tsunami of action.

Speaker 3:          02:33:50       Well the UFC has been super wise but it's promotion. We know how to stay on top and they know, but it just, I would like to see a challenger emerge and like right now it doesn't, you know, there's Beltour has guys like Michael Chandler, they've got some guys that are really exciting and really fun to watch and I think it'd be genuine stars. And of course Michael, a venom for sure, and sent Cyborg. Nahko was called crushing it. Never seen him, never seen him before. Is dented in his skull. It was crazy. It was crazy timing too because you know, cyborg charge down and it was kind of what we're talking about, but someone shooting for a double, but I don't think his knees were on the ground with that. No, but as he shot in Michael Venom page, timed it perfectly and going down in a member technori Goldman Health Gracie, but need burst onto the fight.

Speaker 3:          02:34:43       That was the hops last. That's right. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, man. I mean nice to a guy was trying to take you down. It's so devastating. You, you, you have to commit to that knee or commit to that takedown. Get caught coming in like that. Like you could shoot with what he went in front of your face. It's very hard. That was probably the most horrific injury I've ever seen in MMA. I think so, yeah. Like afterwards, the pictures, you know, with all these little lights on them and saying he wants to fight again. He's nobody's retiring. Just announced. Yeah. I think he snapped back after the fact and we just really realized like, wow, the fucking egg that contains my brain is cracked. I'm like, it's amazing that he recovered the way he did as far as I can. After seeing the, the x rays and pictures, it tuition was fucking insane.

Speaker 3:          02:35:31       I thought he'd be dead and now you think some of the skull was crushed like that. They're dead. I went to fingers. That's the touch. Something of the, of the brain that does something to you. Right? It's a scary thing if you think about it. And how much damage did his brain taking that? I mean, that is a significant mgd, but in his career, not only, uh, Jordan men against him. One amazing thing that just hit that. Who was going on? Oh, crazy. How many. Like you say, if what to seed Nogueira at his prime and UFC. How many wars did old go annual jury go through it. But how many shots did they take? Like full fighter in the garden and Lego men don't do too many fighters in. Probably borrowed the. Again, what we talked about, the stomps, the other Gary Goodrich right now is coming out.

Speaker 3:          02:36:27       It's so sad to see you because the guy was. It was amazing. I just saw the was some, I don't know if it was just one of those sports. A news magazine shows the with the NFL and stuff that they had 99 samples of former football player's brains were dedicated. Out of those, almost 100 percent showed signs of cte. Yeah. I can't imagine you get away without it. I mean, it's just, you're colliding into each other. It's terrible. There's no, there's no way around it. Nope. You know, and if you're, you know, Gary Goodrich said that is really his k one career that did a man may fights the gatekeeper. They're all show you much, but hey, knocked out tito all the way in the beginning. We were talking about it at the pride fighting championships when he came over there. He was a powerful guy, man.

Speaker 3:          02:37:12       He'll, you remember what dodd frank and hope, a speedy recovery. The Dawn. Actually I just texted him yesterday. Yeah, I remember when he came back to a pride, the New Year's eve shown goodridge knocked out right away to the rivalry. But yeah, goodrich was a beast back in the day as well. What happened? He, he beat Gary Young, UFC, UFC of course. And then in the pride, the rematch was, uh, uh, years later in pride on New Year's Eve. And it was like one kick, Gary. Now was it kickboxer, you know, he started training again. Oh, that's right. Yeah, that's right. I forgot them. I member Friday yama courses, the plastic so much. And I felt it immediately forgot about Friday. And then I've added it to goodwill started. What about Swanson? And look how many. I mean, I'm an amazing tool to account many shots. That was a crazy fight. That was the one of the most chaotic fights I've ever watched.

Speaker 3:          02:38:14       And one of the most, like the data wasn't going in my head correctly. I was like, how is he getting hit with these haymakers that cubs Swanson's winging in from downtown Cleveland and cracking him on his head when he came from across the country, punches crazy, just stagger back and then come crack him again. He would stagger back room a room. Everybody's standing there watching it. It was insane. Picked it as the. There's so many. That's a thick. Remember it started with lawler and conduct for fights. That was a crazy holloway. You know, when you draw the line and then they started slugging it out.

Speaker 3:          02:39:04       One of my favorite guys to man, I went up on this, that's going to mcgregor too. Like he's 100 percent convinced he's going to get a title, you know, he's one of these guys that there's nobody's going to know. But we went the distance with connor, but I mean connor did kind of being blown out of the. That's right towards later he said that he was also injured. Oh, Max was. I believe it. You know, max is a real. I mean, he's an interim champion right now, but he's world championship caliber. Oh yeah. Want to see how he does against all though. I want to see how he does. Again, some of the best guys, but know he's finished cups wants. And should we get rid of interim titles through and through boxing, mma all to shit. Uh, I think the only way that interim titles make any sense if someone is recovering from a catastrophic catastrophic injury.

Speaker 3:          02:39:49       Yeah. Like someone blows her acl out and you go, okay, well the title is now going to be suspended for a whole year. Yup. Because it's gonna take six months before you can even start training again and then like nine months we can start training hard and then three months to go through a camp you need and then you've got crews took even longer or, or do you simply say, listen, the title is going to be taken away from you, you know, you, you're not the champion anymore but you are the first one in line as soon as she come back. And that's usually the case a lot of the time. Right. When they do recover they do get the. But I just think the think. So I think that's an easy because then they lose that history books, right? Yeah, that's true. Makes Sense. Someone's got a bad injury and you know, like Anderson Silva made sense with the owner to take it away.

Speaker 3:          02:40:36       And uh, I mean, I know if he wasn't going to defend it, but we know, I mean they, they needed to. Again, I don't think the UFC is the one just down the hallway when they took it away from title. Well, I know, but it's not defending the title. You guys take it away from him. If all those already the champion, then the winter of Holloway and walk, they become the number one contender. Then the problem is you tie up the titles. You got a guy who's the champion champ, champ. Like connor champ at 45 and 55. You got to say you got to vacate one because it's like to hold two of them subsequently or then they should've done it right then and there. He made history. Thank you very much. Was the one title Let. I'm not going to defend all. He's got to decide.

Speaker 3:          02:41:19       You know, he decided he's going to stay at 55 where they decided not to know what the fuck's going on, but I don't think he can get for what if 45. It's going to be hard for. Let's see. There's another way. Cut that. You're right. I don't think we should be at 1:45. Doesn't look like a man when you see me at 1:45 or two to cut in in depth. It's terrible. You can only do that so many times. Much healthier at 1:55 and there's a bunch of fights for him. But then when they were talking about. No, no, no med off fighting. Turning Tony Ferguson guys. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that fucking picture on the left. He looks he looks like a taxi cab. Yeah. Much, much healthier. Right. So I think that, you know, if they were talking about having, although and normally when madoff fight for an interim, 1:55 title or Ferguson was 45, I think that's.

Speaker 3:          02:42:09       Well 45 is now, although all those a champ, right? Max Hall was the interim champ. Those guys have 100 percent, 100 percent. But now all the. I mean I don't know if it's true, but in a normal going out. So it was bullshit. They were talking about Aldo fighting a super fight with Russia and of course Tony Ferguson's like what? Well, Tony Ferguson wanted more money than this contract stated and unfortunately for him, he's in a weird position right now because there's so many fights to be made at 55 and the big one of course is connor. Sure. Anybody who conor fights, if it decides to fight conor and they decided that's the big fight and they put her on in Russia anywhere, but for sure fucking low. I Irish guys in the Russian guys, they do realize just how big he is in Russia, number combined off giant.

Speaker 3:          02:42:57       He's a huge star when he, when he goes on stage too, like when he steps onto the platform and enters into the cage, fucking crowd goes nuts. They know who he is. It's just one of those things where the Russians are way ahead of the game in terms of knowing who he is. He's a giant star over there, but he could be a giant star over here to kids, kids of color on the walls. People and if funny guy to you know, outside of five has got personality. I like him. He's, you know, he's a real wild card in that division because he's undefeated mean we saw one moment of weakness. That's it. One moment was in trouble and he came back from that brilliantly. Cain Velasquez again. Yeah, he's gonna fight again. But you know, he's got some serious fucking medical problems. He's got a stenosis, spinal stenosis, which is.

Speaker 3:          02:43:41       They have to clean out his area. Whereas spine. So what would you fight again? Because he's got. He's got a dream. You say medically like that. If it's better, you don't. Well apparently the doctors are very convinced that they can open up that pathway a little bit and whatever is pressing down on the bone spurs or anything that are pressing down the nerve, they can remove those and that'll alleviate as issues. I don't know that I'm not a doctor. I don't know. Poor guy, man. He fucked up that he had a. He had surgery exactly before the fight. That was a big mistake was because you put, you know, Bob Bennett and the Nevada state commission in a terrible position because you're saying that you're compromised and so then they ran some tests on him and I guess his doctor cleared him, but the Nevada state athletic commission was like, look, you're going to have to have a cortisone shot, numb everything up, and even though you might have some, you know, you don't have really a problem as far as the structure of your back. You might be compromised. Something like, can't do it. Go get the surgery. What about that French? A heavyweight. And God knew who he was. Yeah. He figured it out when you were talking. I was thinking about him. I'm like, wow, that guy is a. he's terrifying monster men. Yeah. And you know, it can punch so fucking hard and he kicks so hard to. And he gets into the octagon to certain dudes. They walk into the octagon. They sound different like fee.

Speaker 3:          02:45:10       They're just bigger man. Gonzaga was Zaga would step on the platform to weigh in and you just feel like Jesus, he's made of stone and it was just heavier. I love those elbows. You remember that he threw so over the top. Through the defense on the ground when he was in the garden. Yeah. Well it was blue. Sweet revenge. When Marco came back, smashed him with elbows from the top and they're crazy. That fight. Mirko was saying that one of the things he doesn't like about the UFC vs pride was the, that there's too much grappling and that there's too many elbows on the ground. What won them? The fight. Grappling and elbows on the ground. Yeah, fucking crazy. He was worried that Zach was just trying to take him down and that he wasn't gonna stand with them so he couldn't get his revenge from the head kick knockout, but he got while he takes Gonzaga down, he's on top and he smashes him with Elvis. It's unbelievable, man. Learn learning game while he realized that it also, when you've got a guy who that level striker, like Arco is

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       throwing elbows from the guard. You see how much force you can generate where he's retired again after winning the rise and things. What a great way. Great way to go out on an epic Korea. One of the all time. Of course, the whole of the prank you pull, but I mean the fight will fade or just. He was one of the. For me, the guy right away when you were around him was like, Holy Shit, I'll never forget his stare down with vandelay for that first fight. My first fight. Someone for someone finally out stared vandelay. No, he was another fruit. No fucking straight up killer can write into your soul. Yeah. Ready to cut your heart out for the fucking butter knife. That was no joke, man. That that's why it was so easy to set him up because America didn't want to interview by anybody.

Speaker 4:          02:46:58       He wanted me to interview him and nobody else could interview him, so that whole respect to state. He never showed foot a whole press conferences. He hated the media media just because. Well there were a member of the translation. He, I guess there was an interview right with our member. There was an interview where I guess the pride people were translating a wrong and he came across these like a few guys. So your boss had a kitchen. But uh, yeah, I was very intimidated. My man and uh, he got me good. But he a wow. But it showed a personality too because that was the time where it. So when he came he became your buddy. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. He played a prank on morrow. Okay, well the, the, the, the, the prank was this, uh, he was facing miracle quote was facing Ron Waterman.

Speaker 4:          02:47:45       Now the way we set it up like two days before the fight, we both interviewed with fighter. He fought interviews, waterman. I interviewed because she never wanted to do anything with kroger. He was afraid of kroger upset. He wasn't one to be interviewed by me. So I'm already before this, I'm thinking, okay, I gotta do some shit. I went to Croak up and I said, listen, I'm going to interview Waterman. And then it's like, oh no, hell no. Mom. But you're going to have to interview a miracle. Are you okay with that? He said sure. So He. Because he thought it was funny. So one of them comes in. I started interviewing him and sure enough when he left, I look at Morrow, I go, oh dude, I'm so sorry. And he goes, what? I said, I interviewed a waterman. So I said, well, you're going to have to do an interview.

Speaker 4:          02:48:25       He goes, no man, I don't want to interview America. You know, it's just a miracle. I never wanted to go to these interviews. He wants to be interviewed on the day of the event in his dressing room. So we go to the dressing room with him and he starts and a miracle is now all in on it and at this moment. And he starts telling you, hey, you know, want in Waterman? He said something about a funeral and miracle, his thinking. He said he'd come back and he says, a funeral list. When somebody passes away and America goes, I know what a funeral this. So it starts like that. And slowly but surely and Sunday miraco stops and he says, you know, I didn't in my life the way you were commentating on my fight the last time. And it wasn't him compensated with somebody else. So he goes, no, no, it wasn't me. No, no, it was you. They looked at his corner and the quarter to go shoot.

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       And he's looking at me tomorrow. Looks at me like a little help, a little help. But I'm just looking away, you know, I'm not saying anything. And then yeah, no, I really didn't expect no, but I really wasn't doing it. But give it back. Go back to the question. So we stopped. But now miracle start getting annoyed, you know, and he doesn't want to ask questions anymore. He says, do it, this guy segment, he doesn't like me, I don't want to scare. So he gets out that we send him back. And we said, no, no, you've got to have to ask him a few more questions. So we know he's going back and he sits down again and he starts going and miracles. Suddenly vehicle gets up, says, you know what, this is it, and he walked straight up tomorrow and Morris stop pissing his pants.

Speaker 1:          02:49:42       Of course things are. This is over and moral comes out and says, no, no. Okay. I don't want to. Do you need one more question? We need one more question because no, I don't want to like a few guys. And I go, Oh, a miracle cream out of the dressing room. And he started walking straight up to Norway. Morris, you seem shrinking. And he goes, do it is all just a joke. It was a miracle coming down. He's gonna fucking left. Kicked my head off, my career's done. I'm finished. And then he, he was in on it, buddy. Yeah, you guys. It was a terrifying. Well that was when he was ahead of the antiterrorist Croatia shit. Yeah. No, he did. He had some hits, some little notches on his life, like big Rambo next. It was some real shit. You never want it to. You never came to the press conferences showed up to fight and got the hell out of dodge. Well, he was one of the first real high level kickboxers to enter into Brian. Once he learned how to sprawl, started lightened up like champion. Remember that knocked out fate or his brother vandelay. The open way to Grand Prix was heavier than vandelay, was to 18 to 14 federal aid. Mark Hunt with randy couture, a commentary. There's a small country over his right eye or put the atomic weight.

Speaker 1:          02:51:18       A lot of people thought that that fight kind of ruined. Vandelay hunt cracked him a couple of times and I'm stunned in that fight and that was one of one of vandelays last fights in his prime, but he's another one man, right? Come money. Just him and Quinton Rampage Jackson. How about that for a dramatic Kao, a Halloween I probably 28 when Jackson did very well in the rematch and then go vandelay catches them again. The nice in between the ropes and he went, holy crap. That was a bad knockout. He smashes, knows what's going on with Randall Randall, who's going to fight and rise. And I heard what he was supposed to fight, bug Miraco in the rising thing and he didn't. He pulled out. He had an injury or something. I don't know. You were hanging out with Bellatore and another one. Man, I can't fight anymore, man.

Speaker 1:          02:52:05       I'm not the one that say by any means. But what's the point? Definitely can fight camp. Fight. Yeah. But not his. He's his health is good. I mean that's it in a long time now too. You've got to think like this is a long time off. Yeah. I remember once he told us in pride, he dog. I go, how long, you know, typical question. How much longer you want to do? Well, randy couture did it until he was 48, so I'm going to do it until I'm 50. Well, what do you guys think about what happened with vandelay? Because with vandelay they came to him, saw came to him, they tried to test him and he's like, I'm Outta here. You fucking brain did the same thing. Remember? He flew back to Holland. Yep. When was this member? He was a war against me. Or was it. Or what the fight was supposed to be where he was the same thing, kind of got out of dodge when testing was looking for him. But vandelay same. Yeah. I didn't know about the house. What it is. Yeah. He uh, what was the first alice stroke first they went to. Same thing, but he tried to say, well, I didn't know that you guys were a sprints away from drugs.

Speaker 1:          02:53:08       Okay. So this is 2012. That was back when it was a real, like a real. This is really rare that you will get caught. Ya, Ya see, break the mirror right there. So yeah, I mean it's done right. It's definitely not gun. I'm guilty. I'm guilty. Yup. Yeah. But it just seems like to me, they railroaded him. I mean, you can't just take the guy's career away, you know, if you tested him and he was positive, that's whatever punishment he, if he runs away from the test, just stays positive. And then he would have already been fighting again. Yeah. You know. But instead they tried to sustain that forever. Forever. Forever for life. So he got that overturned, but now he's still battling out in court who knows how much it cost him in court, but didn't do himself any favors. But with this interview, you know, bashing UFC batch and everybody was worse than that. I started making youtube videos. Right. Took a mania staring in front of the camera.

Speaker 1:          02:54:04       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It just got crazy. Yeah. I mean it was probably some really dark moments for him. Oh, I bet. I mean, where's he make money now? Just as Jim, I guess. Right? Backed. I don't even know what was taught as a fighter for me. It's hard to not do it anymore to. Oh and especially not train anyway so that she can at least when you can train. Right. But did the feeling. There's no feeling like it to walk out that hey, you know, are you training at all anymore? No. One just water exercise on the water and uh, and sometimes had to do with weights trading. My just my right arm. Pretty much works. You're going to fight federally and pride with dynamite show. That was official. That was good. I was facing to fight him to ask me, you want to fight, but identified for a long time and I said, listen, I'd only been striking.

Speaker 1:          02:54:52       So since this is a mix between k one and and pride, why don't we do a kickboxing match, but the gloves, I would love to do that and then. But they didn't go for it. He, he chose another opponent at the time. So. But that. I think that would have been such a change for you. What would it be? Cool. That's good money at the time. That would have been a crazy fight. What's holding? What's holding you back from becoming like pride again? Superstar. A superstar superstar and just they just need some big Japanese dude to come along. There's some sacral Robert type character to capture the public's never brushed of suck Arab guy, man. I mean he took some horrible mess when he fought Hanzo again and the metamorris Kelly and frank and I had a chance to visit with them. Frank was very close to fighting soccer.

Speaker 1:          02:55:43       Robin Pride. They offered a, a big contract. Same thing. They couldn't come to an agreement but a, well, listen, we've got to wrap this up, but you guys were a duo for some of the greatest fights of all time, you know, and I, I enjoyed it deeply enjoyed it and I appreciate you guys coming on joining this a lot and let everybody know about your podcast.
