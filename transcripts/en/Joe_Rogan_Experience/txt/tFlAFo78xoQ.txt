Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three, two,

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       this is live, ladies and gentlemen, and this is a very unusual podcast we're going to have here and a very unusual discussion I have to my left and Michael Shermer, very famous skeptic. He's been on the podcast before, of course, Randall Carlson, amazing gentleman who knows far too much about terrifying things like asteroids and Graham Hancock author, also a fantastic human being, many times been on this podcast as well, and this all came out of a podcast that Randall and Graham and I did recently and Michael Shermer commented on it and it was all essentially on the, um, the, the hypothesis that the great extinction that happened with the North American land animals that happened somewhere around the end of the ice age and, um, the end of the ice age, the abrupt end of the ice age being caused. Please correct me if I fuck this up being caused by a comet impact. Um, Michael Shermer had some questions about that and we said this would be an amazing podcast to get everybody together in a room and go over this. Since then, there's been some interesting stuff that's happened. What I thought, this is really fascinating that Forbes has a mainstream article in Forbes, did a comment wipe out ice age megafauna, and this is actually from just a couple of weeks ago, and then there was also this interpretation that's fairly recent as well, about one of the stone tablets, uh, one of the stone carvings rather on go Beckley, tempe and gram. You would probably be the best to describe that.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Yeah, that was published in Mediterranean Mediterranean archeology and archeometry Peer Review Journal by a couple of scientists from the University of Edinburgh. And they are proposing an interpretation of the. Go back to the TAPI imagery. There's quite a lot of imagery on those t shaped pillars, particularly one pillar, pillar 43 and enclosure d and uh, their deduction, what they take from their interpretation. Of course, many will disagree with them. Their interpretation is that those, uh, those images are speaking of the comet impact there. Speaking of a comment that hit the earth roughly 12,000, 900 years before our time,

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       and Randall, this has been something that you have been obsessed with for many, many years now. We've documented it and detailed in many in many conversations that we've had on the podcast. Oh yes. No, I, I can't say that I'm that familiar with that article. I haven't had a chance to get into it, but this idea that the common impact is the what, what has caused the end of the ice age. Well, it's so complex, but now what we do is we throw or some type of an impact into the mix and it seems to fill gaps that have pulled this right up to you. It seems to fill gaps that were

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       at this point still unexplained. Um, you know, there's varying theories between some extent of climate change in some extent, of human predation that caused the extinction. And I've always felt like you can't blame it on one or the other. I think humans probably had a role but only in the very final stages of the extinction event. And one of the, um, one of the scenarios would certainly suggest that there were extreme climate changes between the bought what's called the Bowling Alley Rod, which was the rather gradual warming at the very end of the pleistocene. Which was then followed by the younger dryas, which was the return to full glacial cold and in the end of the younger Dryas, which is dated at about 11,600, which is considered now to be the, the boundary of the Holocene Post, a younger dryas pre boreal, it's called would be the beginning of the Holocene and it seems that most of the extinctions did occur between roughly 13,000 and 11,600 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:04:04       Although the dating has a widespread on it, so you can't pinpoint it down to a specific event. But I've always felt like that there had to be something we needed to look at that triggered the extreme climate changes that we do see at the end of the ice age. Um, and to my opinion, you can't, um, attribute that solely to milankovitch theories, which is basically the changing solar terrestrial geometries because there are too slow in what we see at the end of the ice age were very rapid climate changes. And so one of the things that I think has been missing has been the trigger. Wallace brecker pointed out, or a years ago that possibly a major flood from the draining of Lake Agassi caused an interruption of the thermo Halian Circulation, which is the basically the circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean and that this might have been what triggered the younger dryas and then also contributed to the mass extinction events, but now I think that the dating of the draining of Lake Agassi is too late for that and was probably a ladder event within the overall melting phenomena that occurred between roughly 14,600 and about 11,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:05:21       Somewhere in there we have to fit that mass extinction event. And, and I definitely have thought that climate change was the dominant factor in that, but then what triggered the climate change? That always seemed to me to be something that was not ever really explained. Um, the comment impact theory is very controversial, but the evidence has been steadily mounting now for a decade, including physical evidence, renovate the core samples that show nuclear glass. I'm scattered out throughout Asia and Europe that are roughly the same time period when they do the core samples. Yes, it's most of it's dating to 12,000, 800 to 13,000 years ago.

Speaker 4:          00:05:59       These are called impact proxies. Nano diamonds, melt, melt glass, microsphere fuels. These kinds of, these kinds of things are associated with impact, not necessarily always caused by impact. So this has been part of the reason for the controversy, but it's the abundance of all of these at a particular level which leads a large group of scientists to feel that we have had a common impacting in the partner. That's the full assemblage of things that it's difficult to explain

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       by processes without invoking some type of a cosmic advance.

Speaker 4:          00:06:30       And it also corresponds with what you believe is a period where earth travels through a series of comments. Well, this

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       gets to, to the, to the ideas of the what would be called the British Neo catastrophist Victor Club and William Napier and, and a number of others that have theorized that from time to time earth counters the debris from a large disintegrating comet. And there's an interesting, uh, William Napier addresses this and an interesting article I can pull up here pretty soon. Um, that possibly around 13,000 years ago, earth may have encountered some of the debris from a disintegrating comment, which ultimately goes back to a fred whipple who was one of the godfathers of, of commentary.

Speaker 4:          00:07:16       It was just coming on that for a second. I mean specifically build, build Api, invicta clue bar are identifying the remnants of this comment, a width of the Taurid meteor stream, which is familiar I think to everybody. We pass through it twice a year. We see meteoroids particularly at end of October, early November, that Deb restream is still there. It still contains, according to their argument, bits of the comment, there are large objects in it like commenting and key read, nicheology auto and so on, four or five kilometers in diameter. And the suggestion is that the media stream has got lots of small bits of dust, but it's got some larger stuff too. And some of that stuff fell out of the media stream 12,800 years ago and impacted primarily the North American ice cap. Now, my goal, when you listened to that podcast, you had some questions. You are professional skeptics. So of course you were skeptical. What are your thoughts about all that?

Speaker 5:          00:08:08       Uh, yeah, let me pull it back and it gave her a bigger picture. After the podcast I went and got the book magicians of the Gods and uh, and actually I listened to it on audio, so it's, I don't know, like 16, 18 hours of, of Graham reading with his, his wonderful British accent, which is, you know, for Americans that elevates the quality of the argument by an order of magnitude. Yeah. That's how they sell things in infomercials over there. And uh, and Graham, you're a good writer. It's a very compelling story to you. You're a great skeptic. And, and, um, you know, and so I think a number of points about in general, the idea of alternative archeology, which is really what we're talking about here. I prefer that to pseudo archeology because that's a little bit of it is supposed to be a little bit of an insult.

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       So alternative archeology it. So it's good to remember that. So you have these guys on the podcast for three or four hours and the audience listening thinks, yeah, why not these guys get a fair hearing. I mean it's like there's the mainstream and then there's these guys, right? But, but there isn't just these guys, there's hundreds of alternative archeological theories. So which one gets the play, which one gets attention, which one doesn't? And for a mainstream archeologist who's busy in the field and trying to get grants and so on, they mostly just don't have the time to sort through all these alternative theories because this is just one. And as we'll see in the next couple of hours, there's hundreds and hundreds of things to be addressed. So that's kind of what we do. Um, so just to rattle off a few of the lost tribes of Israel, who Connell colonize the Americas Mormon archeology, explanation of native Americans, the Kensington Rune stones in Minnesota that the vikings had come here.

Speaker 5:          00:09:51       The black Egyptian hypothesis. When I was in graduate school, this book called Black Athena was published at the Egyptians were actually black and that the sort of western white male dominance of history had written them out of the path. So, you know, this was a whole alternative history, alternative archeology, piltdown man, Thor Heyerdahl and his hypothesis that the Polynesian islands were colonized by South Americans who went west to east to west. That's since been debunked, but that, that's yet another one of these things. South American archeology, Omac statues seemed to have like African features on them, so maybe Africans went directly across to South America. So there's, you know, Eric Van Donican securize stitching now most of these Graham a rejects and in his book too, to your credit. So you're a good skeptic too. Uh, but, but for, for an outsider to an anthropologist from Mars who steps into this thing, cold doesn't know anything, it's like, well, they're all alternative, which is the right one.

Speaker 5:          00:10:51       And how do we know? And so what was the way it works in sciences is the default position is the skeptical position. We assume your hypothesis is not true. Not, not just you, anybody's hypothesis like the, uh, the clue, nate napier hypothesis that was widely published. It was widely covered in mainstream scientific journals and popular science magazines like scientific American and it has not fared that well over the last decade or so. It's still around, it's still debated but that. So you put it into the mainstream through peer review journals and then you go to conferences and you have it out and, and that's kind of where we end up with, well this is what we think is probably true for now. And then all these other people out here, if they don't jump in and into the pool where everybody is, then there's no way for an outsider to know whether these alternative things have any validity or not other than they make a compelling case in a popular book.

Speaker 5:          00:11:49       Yes. But, but what are the mainstream scientists think? So, and the problem is, is that, so a couple of specific things like when I call patternicity, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in random noise. You know, the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese sandwich or whatever. Those are fun examples, but you know, taking like a pictographs, peck, peck, peck the glyphs and then comparing them to constellations like, you know, here we have some constellations on your roof here. It, it's easy in the mind's eye to find a pattern. The question is, did those people really think 10,000 years ago, 5,000 years. So this is a field called archeo astronomy ed crop or the director of the Griffith Observatory here in La. This is what he does. And sometimes the pattern, he thinks the patterns mean something. Sometimes they're totally random and uh, or you take something like the pyramids, you know, as, as, as Graham knows, there's 100 theories about the pyramids and there's the mainstream one.

Speaker 5:          00:12:45       And then there's all these other ones. And this is why people like the director there, he just can't deal with them all, you know. So just as one example I used in my book, white people eat were things that, you know, one guy calculated that if you divide the height of the pyramid to twice the size of the base, you get the number close to Pi. And then he just sorta works all these different numbers, so therefore it's cosmically significant. Well Richard Hoagland was like the best example of what would find these patterns in Mars and the like in claim that like if you go from this rock to half the distance and like why would you do that? Like that doesn't make any sense. He would create these patterns. Right? And that's okay. I mean all scientists look for patterns, so like to take climate change, either the earth is getting warmer, it's not either it's human caused or it's not.

Speaker 5:          00:13:31       There's a pattern in the data. You can see the pattern. The question is, is the pattern real? So this is why we call it, we used the term climate consensus. It's not a democracy, it's not like we voted on it and decided this is the truth. It's that independently. All these different scientists working in different fields, publishing in different journals come to the same conclusion. So we call this conciliate science or convergence of evidence science that it's not like these guys are meeting on the weekends going, boy, we got to combat those. You know, those crazy right wingers with our data there independently coming to these conclusions. So that lifts our confidence that, yeah, there's probably something to their theory such that there's now so much data converting to this, you'd have to deconstruct every one of those independent lines. Um, so then you have things like, um, what I call the problem of the residue of anomalies in any field, there are residue of anomalies we can't explain.

Speaker 5:          00:14:25       So like [inaudible] for example, a Ufo ologists me, a skeptic agree that 90 to 95 percent of all the Ufo sightings are explained by natural phenomenon. Venus swamp gas airplanes piece, whatever. They know that. And so we're really only talking about five percent. Like how do you explain that one right there in 1967 on June third, and yet I don't know. No one knows that one. And then from there they build. Well, that's my case. Then if you can explain that, then I, I have a kate. No, no, no. Well, that's very different than what we're talking about here is how is that relevant. It's totally relevant because I think almost all of your argument is based on this residue of anomalies, uh, what we call the god of the gaps argument. If you scientists can't explain, you know, this particular rock right here or that particular Petroglyph, and I'm going to count that toward my compilation of data to support my hypothesis of a lost civilization.

Speaker 6:          00:15:23       No one is saying that the scientists can explain it. What would essentially, particularly Randall with a series of images as shown is that what you have here is something that can be explained by rapid, rapid melting of the ice caps and Randall stepping on fuel. I'll just go ahead and.

Speaker 5:          00:15:43       Well, they do say it depends what you mean by rapid glacial. Damn. That is our geologists will tell us that moment that, that breaks. That's fairly rapid. Back in [inaudible] 96, it was a very popular book called, uh, Noah's flood. This was a serious book by two geologists that said it was the rapid filling up at the black seat that swamped over the civilizations living on the edges of this and that. That's where the wacky and flood story comes from, so it was widely debated and so on and sense. It hasn't fared that well, but that's fairly rapid. I mean we're talking over the course of weeks or months or years to a geologist, you know, thousands of years is rapid, so impact by a comment and it happens in a couple of hours or a couple of days or weeks versus a couple of months or years. What do we mean by rapid? Okay, well, what are you saying then? Okay, so what are you saying about their theories in particular? Okay, so the problem, I think, Graham, that the deepest problem is, is how much of your theory depends on negative evidence. That is, I don't accept the mainstream explanation for the pyramids, the Sphinx, the Machu Picchu,

Speaker 6:          00:16:52       whatever. Let's not talk about that. Let's just talk about this specific subject because it's going to take a long time just to cover yet.

Speaker 5:          00:16:59       Alright, so my final point is, is the falsifiability one. That is, what would it take to refute your hypothesis? Like for me, the answer would be like if go, go, Beckley, Tepi turned out to be what you think it might've been the place where advanced ancient civilization once inhabited, or they used it. Where are the metal tools? Where are the writing the, the examples of writing?

Speaker 6:          00:17:25       Perhaps the decision was made not to use metal. Perhaps a decision was made that arrows had taken place that, that in reinventing civilization, we shouldn't perhaps go down quite the same route as before. Perhaps writing isn't always an advance. Perhaps perhaps, uh, an oral tradition which, which records in memory which enhances and uses the power of memory may be a very effective way of, of, of dealing with information. We regard writing as a, as an advance, and I can see lots of reasons why it isn't advanced, but if we put our self into the heads of ancient peoples, maybe it wasn't. I mean there's a tradition from ancient Egypt that the god, both God of wisdom was the inventor of writing. But we have, we have a text in which he is. He is questioned by a pharaoh who is, who is saying, well actually have you really done a good thing by introducing writing because then the words may roam around the world without wise advice to, to put them into, into context and what will happen to memory when people do so.

Speaker 6:          00:18:26       So there might be a choice not to not go that way, but, but then what do you mean by advanced when you say there used to be a lost advanced civilization before 10,000 years ago, but let's just wait for a second because what we know for a fact is that the carbon dating in all the area around Beckley, Tapi is somewhere around 12,000 years. Is that correct? Eleven thousand 600 years ago because the earliest they found so far, but a great deal of Rebecca Tapi is still underground. Right? So it, at least what we know is someone built some pretty impressive structures 11,000, 600 years ago, 7,000 years before stone when that story broke. This is long before you came along with your book. Uh, it was controversial in the sense that we thought hunter gatherers could not do something like this because to do that you need a large population with a division of labor and so forth.

Speaker 6:          00:19:16       And so what the response to archeologists was, well, I guess we were wrong about hunter gatherers. Maybe they can do more stuff than we gave them credit for. So why is that not a reasonable hypothesis versus they were, it was actually a band, but we mean something completely different by advanced, not rioting and metal and technology. We mean, I don't know what you mean. What do you mean? Well, I mean we have, we have a body of archeology which goes on for decades, which is saying that a megalithic sites, for example, giganteum in Malta or Hydra, Hydra megalithic sites a date to no older than five and a half to 6,000 years old gig. Tia would push it close to 6,000 years old and they're no oldest sites than that. And therefore the Megalithic site is associated with a certain stage of Neolithic development. Then along comes go, Beckley Tepi 7,000 years older than stonehenge.

Speaker 6:          00:20:12       Incredibly sophisticated site, very large scale. I mean Klaus Schmidt, sadly he's passed away. I spent three days working the site with him. He was very generous to me. He showed me a lot. He talked to me a lot and he said basically 50 times as much as they've already excavated is still is still under the ground that there's hundreds and hundreds of giant stone pillars that they've identified with ground penetrating radar. He's not even sure if they're ever, if they're ever going to excavate them, but by all accounts we are looking. If we take what still under the ground into account, we're looking at the largest megalithic site that's ever been created on earth and it pops up

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       11,600 years ago with no obvious background to it. It just comes out of nowhere. No, to me, that's rather well that we know of, but to me that says that's immediately a rather puzzling and interesting situation and I would be remiss as as an author and an inquire into these matters if I didn't take great interest in that. The sudden appearance, 7,000 years before Stonehenge, you have a megalithic site that dwarfs stonehenge. To me, that's a mystery and it's really worth inquiring into. We love to put it into

Speaker 7:          00:21:14       perspective. That's more than 2000 years older than what we now consider to be the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza in comparison to us to then so between our time now in 2017 in the construction, the great pyramid, you're talking about 2000 years earlier than that and that is unbelievable when you're talking about 7,000 years before what we thought people were doing. Okay, but my point was that instead of before we go down the road of constructing a lost civilization that was super advanced, but different from our idea of advance, why not just attribute to these fully modern hunter gatherers who had the same size brains we have and so on that they were able to figure out and do this. We just under estimated their ability.

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       So why did archeologists tell us for so long? Hunter gatherers couldn't do it, and we needed agricultural populations that could generate surpluses that could pay for the specialist

Speaker 7:          00:22:06       theory, but that was it. So now with archeologists are saying, well, I guess we were wrong about hunter gatherers. Well, they might be wrong about hunter gatherers or there might be another civilization that they had not discovered that has been unearthed by the doctor.

Speaker 4:          00:22:21       Lost civilizations are not such an extraordinary idea. I mean, nobody knew that the Indus Valley civilization existed at all until some railway work was done around Ninja Teodoro in 1923. Suddenly a whole civilization pops up out of the woodwork. There's just never been taken into account before. The 19 twenties. We still can't read it. Script, you know, the. The idea that we, that we come across that another turn of the spade reveals information that causes us to reconsider. Not just was it hunter gatherers or agriculturalist, but perhaps something bigger than this is involved. That's not, that's not such an extraordinary idea. I get it that mainstream archeology doesn't want to go there, but that's my job to go.

Speaker 7:          00:23:00       I don't think that that's correct. They would be happy to go there if there's evidence for it by what you just said. They now fully accept the Indus Valley civilizations. How did that happen? If they were dogmatically? Closed minded and

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       I don't say that they were dogmatically. Closed minded about that. The evidence, the massive amount of evidence that came up with the discovery of Mahindra, Daro, harappa dollar Veera and other and other such sides. It's very difficult. You have to be completely stupid to say that that's not a civilization. Got Beckley tap is a bit more nuanced. You know, we have stone, we have stone circles. We have some interesting astronomical alignment. Is the world's first perfectly north south allied building maybe? No, definitely. Again, that's a patternicity thing. Deciding Klaus Schmidt,

Speaker 7:          00:23:41       well, that's all right, but any of us who read back into

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       10,000 years ago what we're thinking that they might have been thinking, that's always a dangerous for anybody, not just you all. That's a good point. Who Klaus Schmidt classmate was the original excavator Africa, basically tapping. He was the head of the German archeological institute, dig, add to go back to tempe. He kindly spent three days showing me, uh, uh, around the site and really nobody's disputing the astronomical alignment, so I've got back to the me. They weren't particularly interesting to Klaus Schmidt, but they're there. And what is the alignment like? How is it established when you have a perfectly north side, north, south aligned structure, perfectly north, south to true north, not magnetic north. Then you are dealing with astronomy by definition and there are other alignments of the certain struggles as established today or with the procession of the equinox. It's the rotation axis of our planet.

Speaker 6:          00:24:32       Okay, so it to this day, it points exactly in the same place where it was pointing to the true north, but back to the know they don't want to go. Sure. They want to go there. They would happy, be happy to go there. Case in point, two weeks ago in the journal Nature, the most prestigious scientific journal in the world, there was published an article that humans are maybe neanderthals lived in San Diego area 130,000 years ago. This is an order of magnitude older than the clovis date. This was the mastodon bones. They found that balance yet. So here's an example of how. Okay, so clearly there's not some conspiracy to keep alternative people are fringe or or radical theories out. It was published in peer reviewed the most prestigious journal in the world. There it is. Time bad. What happened? Well, it hasn't been a massive reaction to that and lots of.

Speaker 6:          00:25:20       Lots of scathing remarks, either academics, but that's normal. That's how science works. You get, you get pushed back. It's. You got to have a thick skin. It's just the way it goes. Got to have a thick skin, that's for sure, but maybe sometimes your skin is so thick that you can't sense anything around. Of course we don't want that either. So what do you think is going on when you look at something like directly, Beckley tappy that's covered, covered up purposefully, right? Deliberately buried. Again, I say Klaus Schmidt, he, he's the authority on this. He's the excavator. He absolutely adamantly insisted that that site was deliberately buried and finally covered with a hill, which is what got badly tappy means in the Turkish language. Potbellied hill. Yep. And you're talking about something, give me the perspective of how large they believe it is currently as of current.

Speaker 6:          00:26:04       What's excavated at the moment is on a scale of Stonehenge, what's under the ground? Maybe as much as 50 times larger Jesus, but. But it got back the template there. No one lived there. There's no tools. There's no. Well, you're talking about $12,000, but if it's buried, it should be. It should be pottery. There's no pottery, no writing, no articles of clothing. No one lived there when you're saying nobody lived there, so why should they have poetry? Why should pottery beat in the field? But why were they glad they go along and breaks and pots and stick it in the artificial their trash when they see something that would indicate it's different. A different kinds of people than what we're used to seeing in the archaeological record can alert rubbish that they poured in. It's just stones in earth buckets of it. In other words, grant for you to gain support for your theory amongst mainstream archaeologists, they want to see positive evidence to overturn the old theory.

Speaker 6:          00:26:53       In other words, the burden of proof is on the person challenging the mainstream in every field, but isn't there some proof that the mainstream idea of these hunters and gatherers never had anything in what the theory was that would indicate these people were capable of building something you remotely the size of Beckley tend? To me, that's the stunning beauty of this find. It overturns ideas of primitive hunter gatherers. It could not do this. Apparently they can. That's one. Yeah, assessor. Right? So this. I call this somebody else. The bigotry of low expectations. You know, it's like we had this kind of low expectations for these hunter gatherers. Maybe we should jettison that idea. And in my own other field of the history of religion, it also threw that off because this apparently was a kind of a spiritual religious. That's the wrong word. They would have used.

Speaker 6:          00:27:41       Actually nobody can. Nobody can know that that's right. So, but if it was, this is the big national geographic article, emphasize that maybe this is the very first religious spiritual temple ever built because they didn't live there. So they went there for a reason. It also possible that this is signs that civilization was more advanced 12,000 years ago. Then we thought, okay, more advanced. What again? What do we mean by talking about the ability to construct and amazing structural. How big was it? Like how tall were these? Some of them are 20 feet tool. Yeah. But some of them are smaller with, with, with uh, astronomical alignments clashed. Smith called it a center of innovation. He was intrigued by the way that agriculture emerges around go Beckley Tepi at the same time that go back to the tempe is created. I mean, he went on record with me.

Speaker 6:          00:28:27       Perhaps he's not right, but he went on record with me as saying that was the first agriculture. These were the people who invented agriculture. Now to me, the notion that a group of hunter gatherers wake up one morning and invent megalithic architecture, the world's largest megalithic site, and at the same moment invent agriculture stretches credulity a bit. And I think I would prefer to propose, and I have proposed that what we're looking at is evidence of some kind of transfer of technology that people came into that area who had other knowledge, but that was applied and perhaps they mobilize the local population around this site. Perhaps that's precisely why we see agriculture developing there. So perhaps that's the skill that's being passed on, but I don't see anything particularly. Okay. That stone work is spectacular, but that's not any more advanced than a few centuries millennium afterwards when you're talking about something 20 feet of stone that were hunter gatherers, couple hundred people can move multi ton stones.

Speaker 6:          00:29:26       There's no mystery. And moving the stones. I started moving 20 ton stones in Indonesia today. That culture still exists. We. You also know that the carving on the outside is extremely complex. It's three dimensional carving. Okay. But you know, that means that loud. Do you know what that means? That lascaux at 30,000 ago has magnificent cave paintings with three dimension that animals. But that's painting, you know, that they. Hold on a second. Do you know what I'm saying? When I say three dimensional carvings and like the Venus de Milo carvings were on the outside, meaning they didn't carve them into the rock, they carved away the rock around them, which is pretty sophisticated stuff for hunter gatherers and they're doing this on these 20 foot tall stone columns. I mean, it's pretty impressive stuff. Okay, but there, the assumption is that they couldn't have figured this out.

Speaker 6:          00:30:09       We know from modern societies where, say Australian aborigines in one generation, they go from stone tools to fly in airplanes. The brains are quite capable of doing these amazing things. Stones, airplanes. Without somebody introducing them to airplanes. Yeah. You, you're actually making his argument for them. No, no. It's not that much of a reach to carve stone. People have been carving stones, but the tire archeological opinion on megalithic sites for decades before this was precisely that. It was beyond their ability to attend and now that mainstream has changed. It's okay, but let's start. At the very least, they will shift. Let's pause for a moment. Let's pause for a moment. So for sure. We all agree human beings made this. Yes, not even so the aliens, so the argument is not whether or not aliens made it. The argument is whether or not humans made it, that we're sophisticated.

Speaker 6:          00:31:06       Well, there clearly sophisticated enough to make this incredible structure that is is some sign of some sort of civilization. I believe so, yeah, it is. It's a gigantic structure. I agree with grand that we again, undersold who these people were. My friend jared diamond goes to Papa New Guinea. He talks at the opening chapter of guns, germs and steel. How smart these people are that live out there in nature and what it takes to survive. Sure. He wouldn't last an hour from La. He wouldn't last an hour with his pop into Gideon friends out there in the wild because he doesn't know how to survive and they've been passing down the information for generation after generation. Very smart. Okay, so it's not a problem of intelligence. And is there a. okay. So here's the other thing we don't know is that there might be lots more of these sites and where there's the jar I visited, one of them are rotten Teppei you've got, you've got the t shaped pillows sticking out the side of a hill and the farmers back yard.

Speaker 6:          00:32:04       I mean, I think we're actually at the beginning of opening up this inquiry. Not at the end of it, but then it'd be before you. Okay. Why not just say we don't know. This is a spectacular mystery and leave it at that, right? Why write a book we're gonna. Fill in all the gaps on the mainstream side. Won't speculate. I'm willing to explore. I don't claim to be an archeologist. I'm not a scientist. I'm an author. It's my job to offer it a little tentative point of view and to offer a coherently argued alternative point of view. And I must say go back. He strikes me as a gigantic fucking mystery and a mystery that is worthy of exploration from

Speaker 7:          00:32:40       a point of view that may not satisfy you a well, it doesn't. You don't have to satisfy me,

Speaker 4:          00:32:45       you and your, you and your colleagues and I don't, I don't, I certainly don't have to satisfy you or them. That's not my project.

Speaker 7:          00:32:50       Your opening chapter with Schmidt. I thought I really love the kind of conversational style you had with Schmidt in the book where he's dialoguing, where she goes, look at this and then he says, but, but, but wait, what's that again? Now he's a little bit like Columbia, like, wait, wait. I have just one more quick. Just one more question. And you know that ministry kind of thickens. That's perfectly okay. That's great. I mean that's what science is all about is uncovering mysteries that we then have to figure out. So there's always more mysteries, but that doesn't mean that's not positive evidence in favor of a particular theory, like a lost civilization. It's just we can't explain this full stop. Yeah, we certainly can't explain it. And you can explain it by saying that we underestimated hunter and gatherers either. Well, why not? We know they made it.

Speaker 7:          00:33:35       Whatever you want to call them. Well, we know humans made it. That's right. We know humans made then whenever you want to cry, but why do they believe that people were only hunters and gatherers 12,000 years ago? It's because they didn't have any evidence. The contract. This is evidence to the contrary. I agree. So you agree that there weren't harboring hunter and gatherers? Okay. But there's several stages in between just 12 people living out in the jungle by themselves versus us. You know, there's a whole bunch of different. I would say that go Beckley. Tapi is a gigantic stage. While we don't. They didn't live there, so we have to figure out what, where, where were they living in, what was there so that that has to be excavated.

Speaker 4:          00:34:13       Well, the only excavated a 10 percent. Meanwhile what you're saying is that we shouldn't speculate at all because I mean mainstream archeology, speculating, speculating when saying it's definitely was hunter gatherers who did this. That's also a speculation.

Speaker 7:          00:34:28       Okay. But not. They may be more than hunter gatherers. They may have been partially settled. There's, you can have any kind of number of states,

Speaker 4:          00:34:36       but what you can't apparently have is the possibility of a transfer of technology from people who are really masters of that technology already when they came in, but where are these people? Whereas when you're dealing with 12,000 years ago, now let's find their homes. I don't know. I don't know that that Holmes matter. Would their homes even survive after $12,000? I'm not sure there's something. Well, what trash and tools we've got. Go back to the top. It confronts us. It challenges the mainstream model. I think it's reasonable to consider the possibility that there was something more than just hunter gatherer is involved here in creating this extraordinary place and that's all I've done.

Speaker 7:          00:35:14       It seems to me that to say hunter gatherers could build this. I'm not. I wouldn't be opposed to the idea that they're hunting and gathering, but it does certainly imply a lot of leisure time. Yes, a lot of leisure time. Well, we know 100 yet. Oh, sorry. It's okay. It was like, well, again, if we place this back, particularly within that climate zone at 11,006

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       to 12,000, 13,000 years ago, whatever it turns out to be, we're dealing with an extremely demanding and challenging climate, which, which wouldn't necessarily, to my mind be conducive to the emergence of a settled culture that would be capable of undertaking a project on this scale. And as somebody who's built a lot of things and move quite a few heavyweights in my time, um, I find it the idea sort of perplexing to me that they would be what I, what I would have to ask is what is their motive? What is their motive for undertaking a project on this scale? Because it's an enormous project and to move a 20 ton block of stone is really a challenging task to undertake today, today. Well without, without, you know, uh, you know, the infrastructure of, of, of large machines and so forth. But to do it by hand, it would be an enormous undertaking.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       And, and I, you know, to me it's like when are they having time to hunt and gather when you're engaged in a project of this scale, but we know hunter gatherers have way more free time than modern society people do. That's the one thing we've learned is that it's a pretty good way to make a living. Actually, they have a better varied diet than we have. This is the, you know, the Neanderthal Diet, right? They have a better varied diet and a lot more free time. Yeah, but that's a lot less stress. We knew that all along about hunter gatherer is when we were saying they couldn't build megalithic sites, but we're, we're making time to do it where the environment is undergoing rapid changes to which adaptations would be extremely challenging and we know those changes are going on all over the planet. We know that sea levels are rising rapidly, rising over a period of a few thousand years from, from a c stand low of about 400 feet up to the present level.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       We also know that that by Otis, we're shifting dramatically all over the planet. The, the, the effects of the younger Dryas, we're global pretty much that is I think the emerging consensus now that that both hemispheres north and south were being affected by the climate changes or the younger dryas. So what we're doing is replacing this, this phenomenon of this, this project within this context of these extremely challenging times in which, you know, adaptation to the environmental changes could easily be the, the all consuming challenge of the Times. I'm just finding it difficult to imagine a disconnect too, to see this disconnect between a project of this magnitude and the motive for doing it during a time when obviously the environment could be posing serious constraints upon people's ability to function in that random. We don't even know the motives of the Easter islanders and no, we don't raise these huge state, but we know they did it, but as debt become a central question, know what, something to have motivated,

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       but then let's get back to tobacco. Tempe, so we. So let's just be real clear. We know that we're humans. We know that it's at least 12,000 years old and we know that the real dispute here, the real question is, did these people have structures and did they have agriculture? We know that they were human beings. They were essentially modern human beings, so or the hunter gatherers or did they have structures in they didn't have structures and they didn't have agriculture. I'm happy they did. So the fact that they were able to build something so monumental. What kind of a leap is it at all to think that these people could figure out how to plant food and figure out how to make a house?

Speaker 5:          00:39:12       Well, I mean, again, if you look back 30,000 years, 40,000 years to these cave paintings, these are pretty sophisticated, beautiful. They are clearly. They had abstract reasoning. They could think from the concrete to the abstract and so on. It's not a big reach to go from that to moving stones around.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       Let's say there's a big difference between painting and engraving on cave walls and created the largest megalithic site that's ever been built on earth. I think there's a huge difference between those two. I mean, nobody would compare the construction effort on on stonehenge or began tia with cave paintings. I agree with you. The cave paintings are magnificent. I've had the privilege to visit many of the painted cave stunning work and as Picasso said, when he came out of Alaska, we have invented nothing. I mean they were. The staff was that modern human mind, symbolic mind at work there, but this is another matter. This is a large scale construction project that's going on and it's not just a construction person has like huts. It's hundreds and hundreds of very, very large megalithic pillars which have to be mobilized, brought to the place, you know, organizing a workforce in order to do that. Even that requires preparation and time and learning and practice. It's not something that you wake up one morning and just can do overnight. You think that the paintings are more impressive than go back?

Speaker 5:          00:40:29       Yeah. Or at least comparable.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       Yeah. I think that's absolutely ridiculous to convey

Speaker 5:          00:40:35       three dimensionality on a two d plane that because Oh man. It's like, wow, that's a crow.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       It's like developing perspective and to use the natural shape, but it's not create a three dimensional perspective. Look is that's pretty abstract. Comparing apples and pears. It's not a construction project, but I don't think it's even remotely. What I'm saying is that it doesn't take a huge leap of imagination to think these people were pretty smart. They were smart. We know what they are smart. Just because of the fact that those construction projects were done by who? By whoever. We know that they were smart. Whoever built go Beckley tap who was clearly intelligent. Whoever made those three d carvings, clearly they were intelligent, but to think that someone drawing on cave paintings is more impressive. 20 foot stone columns with three dimensional carvings on them have a lot of animals that weren't even native to the to the region. That's not the case because they could have been the Danimals, but my point

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       though is that these paintings are like say 30, 40,000 years old. Took it back to the top so there's tens of thousands of years to develop more that we were very likely to find more archaeological site up til now. We haven't found that we haven't. We haven't found all of that intermediate material which is see if I, if I could actually see that intermediate material between the upper, upper Paleolithic cave art and go back to the top. If I could see the gradual evolution and development of skills, I wouldn't need to invoke a lost civilization. The survivors of a lost civilization who've mastered those skills elsewhere to come in and teach those skills that go badly, Tevye, but it still looks to me like a transfer of technology, unless you can show me that evolutionary process whereby I can understand how this group of hunter gatherers became equipped to create this giant side where they practiced, where they learned the skill to move the stones, to organize the workforce to feed and water the workforce in a rather dry place.

Speaker 6:          00:42:28       All of that is actually quite a logistical challenge. Yup. And obviously somebody met it somehow. Some humans. Yeah. So the real question is, do they have structures, did they have agriculture, did they have some sort of a community where they lived on an established location? I would, I would imagine so would that would push back the time where we thought that there was a civilization that would push them back into a realm of at least stead stepping out of the hunter gatherer stage. Now you're married as you show in your book. He did not go as far as you. You're certainly not, but he admitted it to mystery. Okay. Why? That would be the scientific approach. I don't know what it is. Great mystery. Let's just wait and see. Versus a, I'm going to populate a lot of civilization. Nothing wrong with that grant. It's a free country.

Speaker 6:          00:43:13       And scientists do this all the time as, as you've mentioned, there's a rather humorous thing which I have to say actually, I might even ask Jamie to pull up the, um, the, a couple of images of fingerprints of the gods. That's the book I'm best known for. Uh, and when I, uh, published fingerprints of the Gods in 1995, essentially I was saying civilization is much older and much more mysterious than we thought and I was ridiculed for proposing that 2013, one of the magazines that ridiculed me, New Scientist magazine in Britain, publishers as a cover story picture of go back to Tempe and the headline civilization is much older and much more mysterious than we thought. Okay, fair enough. And, and scientists do do this. I mean, I've followed paleoanthropology for my whole adult life and one of the big mysteries is how did we get a big brain? How do we get to abstract reasoning from, from say what chimps can do. No one knows the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years because no one knows every couple of years there's a new book out. It's climate change. It was the throwing arm cooking, cooking meat. Meat is another big one. A Harvard professor meet. Okay. And these books come and go and some of them have legs, some of them don't. And it's just

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       the way it goes. And it rears Terence Mckenna is pretty obvious. It was psychedelics. Yeah, that's terence. Mckenna's began. But that switch, the brightness, the old Julian Julian Jaynes cabral mind, not at all. This is David Lewis Williams, who's professor of anthropology at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. His neuro psychological theory of Cave Art, all cute Austin Terence Mckenna and food of the gods. He won a brilliant thinker. What a brilliant alternative thinker, but David Lewis Williams at the University of Witwatersrand had been working on this problem since 1973, and his. His argument is that there are remarkable similarities that we see in rock and cave art all around the world are explained that we're dealing with a shamanistic art. Shamanism involves altered states of consciousness. This is typical visions of altered states of consciousness, and it seems to have a company to great leap forward in human behavior. And you've covered this in your book. I covered it in supernatural and natural

Speaker 7:          00:45:26       as did you know Richard Wrangham theory. This is a highly regarded scientist at Harvard. So here's the meat eating guy that it's taking me like cooking the protein. That's what gives you the energy to build a huge brain. Alright, so now this guy is starting with 10, 10 pluses on his side. He's Harvard and already respected and even so his book was like, Eh, probably a series of different events and a bunch of different factors. It could be a number of different things. So let's get away from go Beckley, Tappi and ancient civilizations and let's get back to the geological evidence which randall urine expert at. And this is one of the main things that you had a dispute with and this is one of the reasons why we got everybody together. Now, what are, what is your thoughts on what Randall and Graham propose specifically randall, who is much more on the geological side of things? Yeah. Well this is why I brought in my phone a friend, a geologist. So by way of background after your show, I thought, you know this, let's give this a fair hearing. This is what we do. So this will be our cover story and

Speaker 4:          00:46:33       the summer issue comes out quarterly. I hope that mark defense is going to be doing some more work on the draft of his article for you that is up online because that article is full of bullshit statements about me which are demonstratively false, so he's happy to. I'm happy to engage with those particular issues. Well, I'll have to put on my reading glasses. Whatever articles online this has not been published yet. Claims it claims that it's a draft of the article that will appear in the Tucson 2017 edition of skeptic magazine. So pull it up grandma and grandma. Go over for. So we'll have mark on. So here's magicians of the gods. By the way, Michael, I mean, you say that you're here to, you know, to respectfully aim to get at the truth. There is contract. The lost civilization from. Let me, let me just get to the top of this.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       Uh, I've got it here. Just bear with me a second. So amongst the words in mark defense article, here's accusing me of jumping the public. He's saying that I'm public enemy number one. He's accusing me of arm waving. I wait, I do. Whereby arms a pontificating. Well, my grandfather was a minister of the church, a little interest in peer reviewed research claim that no academic would debate. That's utter bullshit. I had a debate with Zahi Hawass. He's a leading Egyptian Egyptologist back in 2015. There was not my fault that Zahi Hawass walked out on that debate. I can play the video if you like a minute and half of Zahi Hawass lambasted me and then walking out and refusing to debate further. So it's bullshit to say I don't debate or I'm not willing to debate. And finally he says that I'm conning hellacious number of people into buying his books.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       Now, how can we get any dialogue going when somebody begins like that? Ben, would you like some further bear with me because I just have to scroll down and I don't have a mouse. I don't have a mouse. So Hancock and Carlson claimed, uh, several times the academic, no academic would debate them. Not True. I'm a, I'm accused of doing an about face, uh, since uh, since fingerprints of the gods are my, are my views not allowed to evolve with new evidence? Is that somehow a crime on my part? Let me just finish then. I'm a cheap shot, you know, he cites he sues Gomorrah. Um, and, and, and, and, and accuses me of not real or not having the scientific knowledge to issue deal with issues of gravitation. No, it's true that hey, Susan Amara, who is a descendant of the inkers who has worked 70 years on the mega list of sexy woman whose father before him or Fred or Gomorrah works 70 years.

Speaker 4:          00:49:19       It's true that he's got a way out. Theory about gravitation thing is I stated my booklet. It's a way out theory of what I go on to say quoted in the attack is that however, this isn't the part of his theory I'm interested in where I feel he is solidly persuasive, is in his observations of the anomalous character of the monuments of the ad, these etc. Etc. DiffErent. Doesn't cite that. He just presents me as buying what tamara says. I mean, if that's the stanDard that you're going to have in skeptic magazine, you have a serious problem and then go back to the top. Uh, he contends that got back to the is too advanced to being completed by hunter gatherers and must've been constructed by a more advanced civilization. Well, no, that's not what I say. I say it was constructed by hunter gatherers, but that they were advised and supported by people who had knowledge of this kind of work beforehand.

Speaker 4:          00:50:05       Getting, getting a. Well, I think it's very Different. I'm not saying it was constructed by. I'm saying that the, that a group of people settled amongst hunter gatherers and transferred some skills for them. He says that, um, he quotes me. Hancock makes the following stunning claim quote, our ancestors are being initiated into the secrets of metals and how to make swords and knives. I do not make that claim. I'm reporting that this claim is made in the book of enoch. that is not my claim. THen what else? So you don't think that's the explanation? Well, I'm being misrepresented by your author here. If he wants to represent me, if he accuses me of cherry picking, he shouldn't carry. Pick my statements issued for candidates. Let's get it right. It's on the internet. Well, here's a beautiful one he didn't know it was online. It was a beautiful one.

Speaker 4:          00:50:56       He cites klaus schmidt, um, on the, on the character. Actor schmidt makes a salient point almost as if he anticipated hancock's book, quote, fabulous or mythical creatures, creatures such as centers or the sphinx wing bulls are horses do not yet occur in the iconography. And therefore in the mythology of prehistoric times, they must be recognized as creations of the high cultures which arose later. Well, bullshit bullshit bullshit. You've just been talking about the painted caves. Go to show vacay. If you will see a lion man holding started. Lion man carved out of, carved out of mammoth ivory. Go to go to show the bison man straddling lion woman. Her right arm is transferring a is transit to transforming into a, into the head of a lion. so certainly these mythical creatures did exist in the upper paleolithic. And it's rubbish to say that they did.

Speaker 4:          00:51:43       And I mean, how can I go on the teapot? Oh yeah. Okay. So he's, he's taking issue with me because I suggest that the vulture on pillar 43 and enclosure d a is representing the teapot teapot as some of the constellation of sagittarius and he goes and gives us little things of uncle sam and some other thing that he shows to anybody can impose any image on, on anything. Well, it's not my fault That a couple of academics who didn't even talk to me and had nothing whatsoever to do to me published a major study in the. I quoted again the mediterranean archeology and archeometry a peer review journal where they make precisely that identification. So at least I'm not alone, uh, at least there are. There are peer reviewed credentials scholars who also agree that that figure is representing the teapot as tourism within the constellation of sagittarius.

Speaker 4:          00:52:35       No reference to that, um, shocks, opinions. We're supposed to not go into the minutia because they've already been dismissed by a study by lyricists and fathi are too far from it. That study doesn't dismiss shock at all. None of that study was done on the body of the sphinx itself. It was done in the valley and the sphinx temples, and by the way, the dates are extremely troubling. Some of them could push it as far as 3000, 600 bc that the work was done or as early in some cases as 1000 bc. I don't think that study proves anything and, and, and, and so on. And so to clarify what you do believe then so that we don't misrepresent you. Uh, so you don't think that the lost civilization instructed them on the use of metals? I don't know. I don't see evidence for that to go. Would you put that in the book then? I didn't put it in the book. I was quoting the book of enoch. It's a huge passage

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       on the, on the book of enoch. It's not me who's saying that is the book of enoch the same? I understand, but why the contract require your defense to do is to state that hancock is citing the book of enoch. He didn't do that. That's, that is, uh, what's the word? Disingenuous. Is that the polite word you guys use, but more than disingenuous. It's a character assassination. What the question is, why would. What's the context of including that in your book? I forget. Well, the cod, the context is that actually I was. I was criticizing zechariah section. That's primarily what I was saying. You don't think that a lot of civilization instructed the people who build go beckley tip on the use of metals in tools. I see no evidence for that. I see. Go back to the top. I can't, I can't go say they instructed them on the use of metals and tools.

Speaker 6:          00:54:13       Unless I can find evidence for what did they do? We don't make generated agriculture. They created a center of excellence around which they, who built called beckley epi. The lost civilization that advise them that you think happened. What did they do if they, they've come through a cataclysm, their survivors few in number. This is my scenario. You don't have to accept it. I'm sure you don't. Uh, they settle it amongst. Take refuge amongst hunter gatherers. I mean, I don't know. You're probably quite. Have some survival skills. I don't have many, I mean if, uh, if we would have a comedy impact in the world today, which will take out all the underpinnings of modern civilization, uh, I might go settle with hunter gatherer is because they are the people who know best how to live in that situation. medical skills, yeah, because most had togethers, but I might be able to transfer some of my knowledge to them.

Speaker 6:          00:55:02       I might be able to, I might have something that I could transfer to them and I might have very strong reasons why I might not choose to transfer all of it. but. So in other words, perhaps this is what happened. Okay. Maybe. But how is that different from zachariah citron that? Well, the aliens advised it. Well, it's, I think it's massively different, especially since zacharias stitching versus aliens arriving here in 19 seventies. Nasa technology, weirdly, he wrote his book in the 19 seventies. I mean, I don't, uh, I, I, I don't go there. I don't make that, I don't make that suggestion. I'm simply saying perhaps there's been a forgotten episode in human history. Perhaps its fingerprints are present at a nUmber of sites around the world, but perhaps the extremely defensive, arrogant and patronizing attitude of mainstream academia is stopping us from considering that possibility and therefore I campaign to get that possibility considered and I try to do so with as loud a voice as possible.

Speaker 6:          00:55:55       Well, you're doing it, man. It doesn't disturb you that you mean you run skeptic magazine and someone publishes something like that. If it means that goes against the whole idea of critical thinking. I mean, it's misrepresenting his quotes. It's misrepresenting his perspective, his point of view. It's, it's really disingenuous. This is one reason we're doing this so we could get his butt. Why would anybody write something like that? And why would you guys publish something like that without checking the facts? We are a. This was not supposed to be posted online. One of the reason why it's online though. How does something get online to such a person who will do that are useful contributor to your side of the debate? Uh, well, one of the reasons we're here is to get your point of view. Exactly right. All right, so you're saying that there's no evidence that any law civilization exists only the fingerprints of their, their influence on later peoples we do know existed.

Speaker 6:          00:56:51       I'm saying they're physical objects. I say go back to the top is one of them. I say the sphinx is another, but see this is that argument from either ignorance or personal. Incredulity. I don't accept the mainstream or I can't think of how this pyramids could've been built. Therefore it was built by somebody else through some other technology. That's not what I'm saying. So does postdating. It just thinks he's older. Uh, I do go with Robert Stokes argument on the geology. I'm also very interested in the astronomy of the site. And again, I have slides that I could show on this if we have, if we have time you might want to get into ed krups criticism of the orion correlation then why he says it's up to upside down. I can talk to you about that. You know, we do. I mean, I know it had crept argument about that and that was from the nineties I think.

Speaker 6:          00:57:34       What's your thoughts on robert chuck's conclusion? I don't, that's not something I know much about, but it's a huge factor because he knows about shotgun, he rejects it, the basis of that paper and that paper really doesn't date the sphinx. It works with dating of large blocks in the valley and the sphinx temple. There's not a single sample taken from this week. Alright, then who dated it, who dated it liberates us, and then why? Why do mainstream archaeologists not accept the older data for the sphinx and the and the answer is because they have a whole bunch of other evidence that points to the date that they think your answer is very to your question is very simple. Mock laner zahi hawass put it on record back in 1992 when John Anthony West and robert schoch first presented the rainfall erosion evidence on the sphinx and what later on hawaii's said is the sphinx can't possibly be 12,000 plus years old because there was no other culture anywhere in the world that was capable of creating large scale monumental architecture like this.

Speaker 6:          00:58:38       Show me one other structure that's capable of doing that. Well, they could say that in 1992, michael, but they can't say it in 2017, not sensical beckley. Tapis. If you don't mind, graham, could you please, for people. So this could be a standalone thing. People can understand what is the argument about the sphinx, the enclosure, the spanx, and dr robert schoch from boston university who's a geologist. What was his conclusion? What shock is saying is that the sphinx and the trench out of which the sphinx is cut a bears the unmistakable evidence of precipitation induced weathering, weathering caused by exposure to a substantial period of heavy rainfall. And that is particularly pointed out in the vertical fissures in the trench. They see the sphinx itself has been subject to so restoration over so

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       many years that is difficult for people to even see the core body of the sphinx today. Uh, but it's these, you can see the vertical fissures even down at the back of there. That is, that is what shock counts as rainfall, precipitation induced weathering, heavy rainfall, which is selectively removing the softer layers and leaving the harder layers in place. And the problem is we don't have that rainfall in giza in Egypt four and a half thousand years ago. You have to go back much earlier to get that rainfall as the suggestion. So that's the suggestion by robert charge independently. Yes. If your conclusion is totally independently. Yeah. Shock disagrees With me on many things. It wasn't as a matter of fact. Uh, and, and I disagree with him on many things, but I, I think he's on the money on this. So that alone would set back at least that one.

Speaker 4:          01:00:06       I mean, it's pretty much established that the great pyramid of giza was constructed about 2,500 bc. Right? There's absolutely no doubt that a huge project went on at giza around $2,500. So your argument involved the parent, not that the whole thing was that much older, was that parts of it seem to have been from an earlier civilization or at least that civilization far far earlier than I was. I would say that the ground plan, what we have at giza, the basic layout of the site was established in what the ancient egyptians called zep tepi the first time a astronomically and geologically I and my colleagues suggest that the first time can be dated to the period of about 12 and a half to 13,000 years ago, that, that that was when the site was laid out because there's an intriguing astronomical alignments of the great pyramids to the belt of orion.

Speaker 4:          01:00:53       I know ed crop has a completely opposIte view on this and have the great sphinx to the constellation of leo rising [inaudible] housing, the sun on the equinox, the astrological age of leo. Again, I have slides I can in that would align with the geological evidence that robert schoch complies with a geological evidence. They always eight years of age of leo, pretty much exactly spans the younger dryas as metro thing. And so the only argument agaInst that at the time was that there were no other structures like that from 12,000 years. Correct. And then ben crump said that the, that the orion correlation wasn't real. Uh, because it was upside down. I do want to get into that now.

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       Well first, that's not the only argument. It's that, okay, if the sphinx is built or the layout for the whole thing is built in say 10, 11,000 years ago and then, and then the pyramids are built 2,500 bc. What happened in between where all the people that trash the places where they lived, styles

Speaker 4:          01:01:49       of construction but not dated in between. I would propose michael something like a monastery, which has a relatively small archeological footprint, is on the side. I mean the idea of information, knowledge and traditions lasting for thousands of years within a religious system shouldn't be too absurd to us. I'm in judaism is dealing with ideas that are already best part of 4,000 years old if we go back to the child sees and so on and so forth. So that's all I'm suggesting really that, that the idea is preserved, maintained that the, the survivors of on the site, but something like a monastery, which is, which has got a very small archeological footprint. It is not high. Perhaps. Again, one can only speculate and I think there's a lot of speculation on the archeological side to one can only speculate, perhaps having gone through a cataclysm, perhaps they felt to blame for this wrongly or rightly, I mean there are many, many traditions in which humanity's behavior is implicated in the cataclysm that takes place and perhaps they didn't want to switch civilization on completely right there.

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Perhaps they perhaps they waited, pass down the knowledge through initiates enough was there to create a mystery because it's undoubtedly a mystery that the construction of the great pyramids, the first huge pyramids in Egypt proceeded only really by the xhosa pyramid at sakara. That the construction of the great pyramids is vastly superior to the construction of the pyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasty that follow it. And that's a little bit counterintuitive that we have this collapsed and skills one would have expected it to get better. So it sounds like the work on the pyramid started already with a level of knowledge.

Speaker 5:          01:03:22       Yes, but okay, so here's, here's, I would think about that. There's a lot of perhaps seeing and maybes because big as well, so you have a bunch of egyptologists and archeologists who have been working on this site for centuries. This is one of the most ancient mysteries and so on and so say, let's say there's like 20 lines of evidence that point to built roughly around this time period here and then you come on and say, okay, but there's this one anomaly of the rain thing that in the there was only rain at this time. Now there's a huge gap. You have one anomaly or line of evidence here and like 20 here we're talking about different structures, so there's not a lot of evidence that points to the sphinx being from a particular time period. Well, he's saying like 12,000,

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       right? I'm saying the rainfall evidence suggests that by other evidence that alignment, that is alignment with the constellation of leo housing, the sun, right? Dawn, on the spring equinox, it's an equinox. Your market. Nobody would dispute that. Nobody would dispute that. The age of digit. Well, no. I mean, if you make a monument pointing perfectly joyous, I've stood on the back of the sphinx at dawn on the spring equinox, and believe me, I guess I could show a picture. It's head lines up perfectly with the risinG sun, but no, I don't think anybody even crop is disputing that. it's an equinox. Your market. Now here's the thing, you're an ancient egyptian. You're building an equinox. Your market in 2,500 bc. Do you know what constellation is? Housing the son in two thousAnd 500 bc. I haven't run a little program. It's the constellation of taurus. So. So logically, if you're creating an equitable and the ancient egyptians Were not shy about making images of balls, plenty of them. If you're making an equinox, your marker in 2,500 bc reshoot, create it in the form of a bull, not in the form of a lion. You know? That's the. That's the puzzling issue. And yet we do have a time when a lion constellation housed the sun at dawn on the spring equinox, and that is the period of the younger dryas. Okay. I'd say that's a pretty big leap. I know you say that and your colleagues also that too, and

Speaker 5:          01:05:12       so now and then we have a gap of about five or 6,000 years where there's nothing. There's no real.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       Yeah, please do. I'm going to refer back to several articles that were published in the eighties and nineties. This one is from from nature, early eighties, late quaternary history of denial and what it's discussing is the evidence that there was a major shift in the in the hydraulic regime of the nile river. It says between 20,000 and 12,000 years before present when timberline into headwaters was lower vegetation cover more opened in today. The nile was a highly seasonal, braided river which brought mixed course and find sediments down to Egypt and Sudan. This cold dry interval had entered ended by 12,500 years before present when overflow from lake victoria and higher rainfall in Ethiopia sent extraordinary floods down the main aisle and those floods had been documented to have been 120 feet above the modern flood plain of denial. Any civilization or whatever you want to call it, living along denial river at that time would have had to abandoned whatever they were doing there in the industry regime.

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       This intensified hydraulic regime. And it says, it goes on to say it marked a revolutionary change to continuous flow with a superimposed flood peak. So what happened is that there was a major environmental change that occurred right there around 12,000 to 12,000, 500 years. The dating could be adjusted somewhat since the early eighties, but the point is made is that because of a major hydrological change, major vegetational cover change, major environmental change, this would've caused also in imposed changes upon whatever culture was existing ehr or living there at the time. Now, what we have is in the aftermath of that event, we have basically the emergence of desert, which now would require serious adaptation. It's very likely to that these events, uh, could have also decimated the population at the time leaving, um, basically no workforce. And then over a period of two or three or 4,000 years, you find that, that there is enough of a recovery that these kinds of monumental structures can be renewed.

Speaker 3:          01:07:39       Um, but it's clear from this and a lot of other studies studies in the eastern mediterranean showing that there are sap propel layers which is caused, which is basically material that has been washed in from the continental surface that has not oxidized it. HIs essentially become rotten and carried in organic material, carried in off of the continents by this enhanced regime of, of waterflow actually forcing so much water that there was a freshwater lid on the eastern mediterranean that, uh, caused a cessation in the, the, the, the circulation between the upper waters and the lower waters, reducing the amount of oxygen brought down to the, to the lower waters. And so you had these layers of mud that formed on the bottom of the mediterranean that show this massive influx of fresh water flowing off of, out of denial and off of the, the egyptian continent at this same time.

Speaker 3:          01:08:39       So clearly the evidence shows that there were major climatic changes that occurred around this time. It is not so speculative to, to imagine that whoever, whatever, and we don't have to invoke any kind of a super advanced civilization, but whatever cultures were there that were perhaps capable of carving blocks of stone transporting blocks of stone as they were at go back during this time range would have been that their, that their activity would have been interrupted to the extent that it might've taken millennia to, to recover, to get the, get the labor force necessary to undertake major monumental programs on the giza plateau. So, so I think that if we assume this gradual listic scenario, yeah, that's a fair question to ask were what happened in that interval. But if there is a major climatic downturn and a major disruption of the several patterns of whatever culture was already there, then you know, now we might have an explanation why there would be a gap, especially if these events caused a, uh, a bottleneck in the population of the area.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       of course, this is all speculative, but it is not speculative to say that there is multiple lines of evidence suggesting these major even cataclysmic changes that engulfed that part of the world during that era, so that could, that could provide an explanation of why there is a gap there. Makes total sense. Well, it does it because does it not only if you have to have this thing in conjunction with 12,000 years ago in the lost civilization, if you just say that rain water erosion on the sphinx, it is not an explanation for the age and that the traditional accepted age is what we think it is. Then there's no gap to fill. Yeah, so really we're talking about is we have, again, lots of evidence here. One anomaly here. I really want the anomaly thing to stick, so I got to explain the gap. The gap is explained by environmental changes.

Speaker 4:          01:10:43       What is the. What is the lots of evidence other than a lot of assumptions. It's babies. It's actually, can you cite me a single contemporary instruction from the date that the sphinx is supposed to have been made? That refers to the swings. I'm sorry. Can you cite a single contemporary inscription, contemporary contemporary to the date that egyptologists ascribed to the sphinx in other ways during the reign of [inaudible]? Can you cite me a single inscription that talks about the sphinx being built? This is scott. I don't. I don't study this area. I don't know. Okay. Well you can't because there is no such inscription. Okay. Well, so what one would have thought they would. Well maybe it's a giant project is 270 feet long, is 70 feet high. It's carved out of solid rock. Nothing, but you have no reference to toll in the old kingdom.

Speaker 4:          01:11:28       You actually have to come down to the new kingdom to get references to the sphinx and inscriptions that. But you've already said that the pyramids were built at the time we think they were built, not thousands. I would say that a great deal of work was done on the pyramids at the time of 2,500 bc. I think the ground plan was laid out and we have like the step pyramid, which is crude or not as well designed as the other pyramids. That's, that's a transitional stage at that time often argued to be a transitional stage. have you been to the step? I'm sure. RigHt. And you've been to giza though? No, I've never been to giza. Oh dear. Well, will they do make a very different impact? I mean, I've climbed the great pyramid five times. I mean, you're dealing with something orders of magnitude different in terms of what's required.

Speaker 4:          01:12:08       I mean this thing weighs 6 million tons, but it's 481 feet high. It consists of two and a half million individual blocks of stone. It's aligned to true north within three 60th of a single degree. I mean, to compare that to zosyn, uh, is really not a valid comparison at all. What's more interesting to me is the radical decline that takes place in pyramid building skills. In the fifth and sixth titus, he go to ou nasco, the pepe go to tatiana sakara. These are a shambles. You can hardly even recognize them as a payment. What happened to all that knowledge that's invested in the great pyramid? Why does Egypt evolve so rapidly? Uh, what, how do we explain this pristine, amazing work that's done on the great period? Unless there's a legacy of knowledge being attached to it. So every archeologist, Egypt, egyptian archeologist and egyptian knows everything you just said they didn't and they don't accept any of the arguments.

Speaker 4:          01:13:00       Why not? That's why I'm needed because somebody's got to counter this. Is it just that they're closed minded and they follow a lot of us and they never think for themselves. You want to see a close mind, I'll play you one and a half minute videos out here, wash, refusing to debate with me, but all of them, every one of the egyptologist and archeologist over the last two centuries and so on, they're all dogmatically, closed minded and they can't see the arguments declares you or is it? They're not convinced by your argument. They're not convinced by my argument. They genuinely an absolutely believed that their argument is right. The notion that I'm proposing is apparently so preposterous to them that it isn't even worthy of consideration, but it is worthy of insults and attacks on me, on my integrity or my decency as a human being. On my honesty. All of those things get attacked, you know, because mainstream and that's fine. I'm ready for that and that. By the way, I know that archaeologists academics constantly attack each other all the time. I used to take this stuff personally, but then when I see what they do to each other, the ravaging attack, dogs are let loose on on any new idea. I sometimes wish scientists would, would actually look for what's good in a new idea rather than what's bad, but I get why they do it for that, but in other integrated young graduate student

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       working in that area could make a name for himself by overturning a son was a young graduate student at the university of cardiff studying egyptology. He got marked down in his degree because he proposed the possibility that the pyramids and the sphinx might be or might have older origins. He was impressed by my work. It did him a lot of harm in his degree and and if all this was true, then eventually I'm announcing my point, my point, which is if you go against the mainstream view, your career does not progress as an ego. I disagree. I mean how many an example, how is it that we know? Anything that we know about each example from Egypt tology of somebody who's gone against the mainstream view and being lauded for, so doing well, we don't believe everything about it that we believe two centuries ago and say napoleon's time.

Speaker 6:          01:14:55       Right? How did that knowledge come about? How did all the change that science identity begins with sean polygon and the deciphering of the rosetta stone? How was he able to do that against the mainstream? There was no mainstream. The mainstream has taken time to form and it's a very solid now just all sing from the same hymn book. You'll find very little disagreement in every field, but somehow or another, einstein managed to make an impact because he turned out to be right. Well, I'm no einstein and I don't know if I'm right, but I'm going to continue to oppose that mainstream. Somebody has to earth. That's a valid comparison. Einstein and archeology take paleoanthropology. I mean it's a completely different field now than a century ago. How did that happen? If no one ever accepts new ideas? They do. It happens all the time while they're being forced to accept basically tempe and that's a new idea that like, you know, what you were talking about things taking a long time and what seems like a long time to us is really a blink of the eye and in terms of archeology, we're in the middle of that were essentially in the middle of that with things like go beckley, tappy with forbes publishing an article about the younger dryas possibly being impacted by comments and that being one of the causes of mass extinction.

Speaker 6:          01:16:05       Right? And when these are all mainstream ideas and everyone alvarez proposed the impact hypothesis for the demise of the dinosaurs in 1980. It was ridiculed and, but he turned out to be right. And then that became the accepted. It takes time. But what was the title? People are challenging. Those are the key turning point, the finding of the crater. That's what, that's what made the difference so hard to argue with it. So I get, where's your creator? Well, this is where perhaps we need to bring in our phone, a friend, malcolm, the comp, one of the, one of the younger dryas impact impact scientists. I mean the, the point, the point being made is the following, firstly that the primary impacts were on ice there. That they may have been as many as four impacts that they were on the north american ice cap. Some creators have been suggested, for example, very deep holes in the great lakes, uh, other creators have been and will be looked at by the team in the, in the coming months, whether it includes the corozal created that quebec, quebec terrain. And so on and so forth. There are candidates that the creature has not been found yet. But I would be surprised if a creator was easy to find when, uh, you know, the impact is on two mile deep bass, you know, one of the biggest strewn fields in the world, which is the australian strewn tektites, drew infield. THere's no greater associated with that, but everybody accepts the impact proxies. There's enough of them to, to justify that. And that's what's going on around this impact hypothesis are related

Speaker 5:          01:17:23       questionnaire is not the lost civilizations and the demise of humans, but the mega financial extinction of north american mammals. So this has been long debated before the impact hypothesis was proposed in the competing hypotheses were over hunting. Humans just haunted them to point where not every last one to the point where the population numbers get too low and these species can survive, or climate change or both the climate change week in the populations than the humans came over and over a hunted him. Alright, so, and then the impact hypothesis is proposed. Okay. So this was debated and it didn't fare that well because there were a lot of mammals and other species that didn't go extinct that you would expect from a massive impact like that. It would have wiped out. Why? Why the selected species, the kinds of species that humans would hunt are the ones that went extinct. Whereas these others didn't.

Speaker 6:          01:18:14       Well, why

Speaker 3:          01:18:16       the largest? There is no evidence. The human humans hunted. The predators. There is evidence that they hunted woolly mammoths, but it's a very sparse. I mean you have no more than a dozen sites that show association between a human hunting and mammoths and a lot of those like the lubbock lake site is now being questioned. What was presumably we'd previously interpreted as being butchering marks on on the mammoth remains. There are now being reinterpreted as possibly natural marks on the, on the mammoth bones, but it's a big stretch to go from, okay, we've got a dozen sites where we have mammoth remains and along with those mammoth remains we find a few clovis spearpoints in two or three cases we actually flying or they have found spear points embedded within the mammoth lake in the rib rib cage, but it's a very large stretch to go from there to say that 10 or $12, million woolly mammoths or or four species of mamet's on four continents were wiped out by paleo indian hunters. Probably in bands of no more than two or three dozen we've ever been

Speaker 6:          01:19:24       to a head smashed in buffalo site. Yes, but, but, but that's a good example because nowhere did that go anywhere close to exterminating the species of american bison. But at each site has its own particular explanation. Could be hunting, could it be a massive flood, earthquake, whatever. They'll be a massive flood. Yes, exactly. I think there you and I would be in complete agreement.

Speaker 5:          01:19:46       That doesn't mean by massive global versus local cell. For example, there's 50 to mammalian generra went extinct in south America. Why would they go extinct in south America at about the time that humans were moving

Speaker 6:          01:19:56       down there? The younger dryas impact hypothesis include south America, indoor impacts there. It does. And, and, and again, the dating of

Speaker 3:          01:20:05       the migration of humans into America is controversial at this point. Um, you know, there is evidence that humans were there long before, you know, paul martin's idea of, of blitzkrieg requires that the animals be so stupid that they couldn't, like they had no adaptive capabilities to the appearance of a new predatory species. But well, what is being demonstrated from examining the lifeways of, of the paleo indian peoples, is that they had very diversified diets and they were hunter gatherers. Now, why would they be choosing the largest, most dangerous animals to hunt when they had such a proliferation of other smaller animals? We know that they were foraging, we know that they were eating seafood. There was an and fishing, um, because all of this is being found in the, in the camps. Um, and then it certainly doesn't explain the extermination of the cave bears. The short faced bears, the camelot, the giant beavers, the giant armadillos, the american place to seen lion, the, the, the, the ground slots that were the size of giraffes, four species of, of provosts, indians, meaning mammoths extinct on four continents. And to me like, wait a second, we don't, we cannot, we cannot invoke a modern example to, to say, well, here is mallory. Well, that's controversial also. Um, and the nature of the albert's extinct

Speaker 1:          01:21:38       past eagle, that's an assumption that in people with adult adults killing off all the saber tooth tigers. And here's another answer to one of your questions. You were saying like why would some of the animals be alive? Well, we know that the, the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, it didn't kill everything, right? That is a massive impact far bigger than anything we're talking about. And many, many anImals survive that. So we don't know why things survive and why they don't. It could be proximity to the impact. It could be that their food source wasn't removed. It could be that they're predators were wiped out and they managed to survive. I mean, there's a lot of animals that are still, that are alive today in this continent. Like for instance, the pronghorn antelope, pronghorn antelope, dan flores, who's a wildlife historian, wrote an amazing book on it and we were talking about the, uh, american savannah during, you know, like 15,000 plus years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:22:33       There was all sorts of crazy animals millions of years ago that were like cheetahs that were running down animals at extreme speeds, which is a reason why pronghorn antelopes can run so much faster than any of their current predators because something much faster than them was killing them. And that was wIped out. But they managed to make it. One of the reasons why they probably manage to make it is because they're predators were wiped out. It's not an even point, michael, if it's overkill, it's, it's intriguing that the ova kill occurs, you know, precisely the younger dryas window because

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       I think you'd agree that now the whole story of the peopling of the americas is pretty much up for grabs. I mean, clovis first was the dominant model for a very long time and under that model were to envisage these clovis hunters coming in across the bering land bridge, going down the ice free car door and then in like 800 years with their sophisticated fluted points, they wipe out all the mammoths in in north America, but now we know that humans have been coexisting and butchering mammas coexisting with mammas for thousands of years before that, possibly tens of thousands of years before that. Evidence in siberia. I don't only mean from evidence in siberia I've. I mean, I can cite you from from nature magazine just recently. Huge, huge number. I don't think the yukon is in siberia, is it? No one's in north America. Jack sunk mars, you know the excavator of thE bluefish caves in the yukon back in the 19 seventies were proposed, was proposing that human beings had been in America is at least 24,000 years ago.

Speaker 4:          01:24:01       His repuTation was utterly destroyed. his research funding was withdrawn. He was given no access to grants. He wasn't able to do his work. He was heavily penalized and punished by the community, and now just a few weeks ago, we have the smithsonian coming out and saying, sorry, we got it wrong. Jack myers was right all along and tom dillehay, you know, with his work in monte verde, the shit that he had to take a. I Think we're, we're in a very interesting time. The peopling of the americas is really a paradigm that has absolutely been overthrown. The notion of, well, you disagree with ms.one and then, which is fine. I'm

Speaker 6:          01:24:35       no the mesa verde. It's an isolated. Again, it's an anomaly. It's an isolated site where all the sites between clovis and monteverdi was still first for thousands and thousands of years. Come on my condition. Where are all the people between clovis and motto? My problem iS your problem. It's your problem and bear in monte veriday and they're there in north America. It's more likely that they'll figure out why there's a dentist in south american indians and not in north America. It's like the nature paper. I people cross the ocean that, uh, that there were. Neanderthals are humans in san diego 130,000 years ago. Okay. But when you look at that. Okay, so they have mammoth bones. It looks like they might have been broken in the length and the tools, but they're not. Okay. The tool kind of changing subjects here though. Well, no, no, no. You're going to quibble the evidence of human presence. That's right. You'll try to quibble it. We're not quibble. Challenge it. You're quibbling. Then you're going to rewrite this saying very specifically. That's opposing what he just said. The reason archaeologists don't accept earlier than clovis, say earlier than about 13,000. 14,000 is massively, massively accepted. Say mesa verde for example. Okay. I have to bring up an image at mesa verde. Do accept mason is accepted like. Well you sure about this as 24,000 years?

Speaker 4:          01:25:54       Fifteen plus possibly. Possibly. Significantly.

Speaker 6:          01:25:57       Yeah. Okay, so significantly 15 is kind of the outside of the Window that humans came across the bering strait. That's possible. Not 24. Clovis first, not 100 and thIrty thousand years ago. Now, if it turns out that that nature papers. Right, and that's confirmed that that does overturn the mainstream theory for sure, but why would you. This is not like your field of study. Why would you argue against the nature of liver? Okay, I'll just give you ask professionals myths. Number five today, decades later, the clovis first model has collapsed. Okay? Based on dozens of new studies, we now know that pre-clovis people's slaughtered mastodons in Washington state dined on desert parsley in Oregon made all purpose stone tools that were ice age version of the $13,000. That's not no look at 24,000 years down at the bottom. Michael, you know, are you saying the smithsonian or wrong on this?

Speaker 6:          01:26:52       Michael, you're jumping to conclusions before you even read that. You want to be right so badly. You didn't read the part and other animals. They're on a second confIrming that humans had butchered horses and other animals. They're 24,000 years ago. It says it right there and you are arguing guested without even reading it, which means you want to be right. No, no. That's absolutely what's going on. So I have no dog in this fight. We started pointing at you being published skeptic magazine and you have no dog in the fight. You're asking me, why don't mainstream archaeologists except you should be skeptical of hens about color, whatever you want. it goes back 1130. What do you think about what that says that there's evidence they butchered horses 24,000 years ago. Okay. I would have to check the site on it. I haven't seen this article, but now that you have seen it, not my problem.

Speaker 6:          01:27:40       Okay. Probably hear opposing this and you're saying there's no evidence you have any fucking article. I'm not opposing anything. I'm saying you certainly the reason why scientists except these dates here because there's lots and lots of evidenCe for that is scientists and eleven thousand twelve thousand is that a scientist and you find one person that says 24,000, another one like two weeks ago. It's not one person. you're walking this without really doing any research about it and then the article is titled what happens when an archeologist challenges mainstream thinking and the smithsonian in the month of march. Okay. Jack sunk mas. It was a brutal experience. Something that sank mas once likened to the spanish inquisition at conferences, audiences paid little heat to his presentation, giving short shrift to the evidence, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So it was always the same when he proposed that bluefish quays was 24,000 years old. It was not accepted. What the smithsonian are saying is now this is accepted. You need to get up to speed with data. Michael, my, my archeology friends like jared diamond, who I just checked with on this who's at ucla, but he certainly has a dog in the fight. And, and uh, well he just says, here's the problem. For 50 years, people propose pre-clovis. ExamPles recites or they never hold up. They always dating turned out to be incorrect. The carbon 14 was not calibrated right. There was this, there was that they never hold up.

Speaker 1:          01:29:10       Essentially your friend for 50 years. Well, you're quoting a friend who says the evidence hasn't held up before. Instead of quoting these articles with these scientists were talking about the data that's showing the human beings butchered horses 24,000 years ago. You're disputing it just because you talked to a friend.

Speaker 6:          01:29:28       I'm saying that that has to be confirmed. that particular argue against it. I'm not arguing against. Certainly were. No, I'm just saying that was my right. I feel you were arguing against it and saying that it's not the case and then you seem to be, if I'm correct, you seem to be a clovis first advocate, but put you, put you in reputation on the line and say you're not going to put a label on it. I'm going to say in the latest evidence that that overwhelmingly shows humans coming across the siberian straight into north America, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,000 years and they definitely did. Then they definiteLy did that. Did they before what could push it back? Much earlier? It would be if they came by boat. Okay, so like where I live in santa barbara, there are sites on the channel. Islands had to go back 11, 12,000 years ago and they came by boat.

Speaker 6:          01:30:16       Now the problem is is if they lived on the shores, which is where the good fishing and eating is, those are underwater and short of doing good underwater archeology, which is hard to do and expensive and most of it's probably gone. We may never know. One of my beefs with archeology actually is that 10 million square miles of the planet that were above water during the ice age or underwater now and marine archeology still mainly looking at ship wrecks, you know? Well, okay. They do that because It's. It's, it's where the light is leaves the big unanswered question. At any rate, so for the record It can at least say that you completely opposed the smithsonian's position on this that there has been no paradigm shift will look at this. I haven't seen this besides anything I'm not aware of the horse find from 24,000 years ago.

Speaker 6:          01:30:56       I am aWare of the hundred 30,000 year date from the nature paper. I have a slide on that too, and if tools, they're nothing like clovis points. It's just a big hand rock that might have been used. It might've been random. Sorry, a big hand rock is all there is before 13,000 years ago. No, I'm talking about 130,000 year old site. One hundred and $30. You're talking about the san diego is. We don't. We don't need to talk about that. That raises interesting questions. Was it neanderthals? Was it denisovans? Was it anatomically modern humans? One hundred and $30,000 raises interesting questions. President misinterpreted site because they aren't. I'm not pinning anything to that. I'm just saying yes. That report was published in nature.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       The stone tools. It's about how the bones were shattered and they believed the bones are shattered. Deliberately indicating that someone was trying to get at the marrow indicating more maybe or a tractor rolled over it a couple of years ago. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no one had known it is excavated. That's just speculation.

Speaker 6:          01:31:58       Important. This part, this

Speaker 7:          01:32:00       was one of the immediately defined, has been quibbled by the archeological mainstream. Of course it's been published by the archeological mainstream too and the rest of the mainstream is quibbling with. You said that can't happen. We will say, what can't happen that the mainstream won't allow a radical ideas to nature and published it, and the article, the idea is being quibbled and nature certainly would not have published it if the evidence would not strong. I accept that nature is not in the business of publishing, you know, fringey stuff. It's a. It is. It is a radical proposal, but it's strong enough to justify publication in nature. what's interesting to me is that the immediate reaction of the archaeological community is not say, well, what could this mean? Let's, let's look into the implications of this. I mean if there were neanderthals or denisovans in north America a hundred and 30,000 years ago, we have a whole new scenario building here that really should interest everyone instead of.

Speaker 7:          01:32:52       Instead of the first reaction is let's destroy this because it's really annoying. Let's get rid of it. Let's prove it's wrong. Let's suggest tHat it was a fucking bulldozer or something like that. Maybe it was, I don't know. The work hasn't been. Hasn't been done yet, but that instant sort of. It's almost like an immune response to a. To an idea that doesn't fit into the prevailing paradigm, but the other work, the work in south America, the bluefish quays work, that's really not controversial anymore. It's very widely accepted. Clovis first is a discredited and abandoned position and I have something else to asK you actually concerning genetics and dna. I'm sure you're well up on that. I mean, can you explain why we have a strong Signal of denisovan dna in certain groups of south american indians and in australian aborigines and melanesians, but that denisovan dna doesn't crop up in north american indians.

Speaker 7:          01:33:43       How would we explain that if they all came through the bering strait? I have no idea. Well, it could be both, but I mean this just happens to be something I don't know anything about. Okay. So part of the problem and if even doing this is that was your idea. Well here we are talking. This is good, but part of the risk is that you're going to find something I don't happen to know about. And then it's like, you see, I made my point what point that. Okay, so in like the history of the people of America that, that area, uh, there's always somebody that comes in with, it's not clovis, it's this, it's that. And rarely do they last why the dates were miscalibrated or whatever. It's not just thAt scientists are closed minded, although they can be, it's that the convergence of evidence iSn't strong enough to overturn the mainstream theory.

Speaker 7:          01:34:28       So, but, but it does happen. Uh, you know, maybe there are multiple migrations into north America and we just don't have all the sites, but when somebody comes up with a site like that's tens of thousands of years earlier than all the others that are accepted here and it's over here where all the sites in between. Whereas it's like the gap, the 5,000 year gap with the egyptian complex. Where are the sites? If it's true, we didn't fly it here so I had to get there and there must be a trail, you know, somewhere that we could find it unless they came by boat. And then that's evidence is done unless you're dealing with 24,000 years ago and there's not much evidence to find that navy, but if they came by boat and that clearly implies the head navigational skills, they had the ability to build boats and, and you know, find your way across the ocean.

Speaker 7:          01:35:14       You could do the coast that, that's not quite as, you don't need a big ocean going, but you know, you don't need an ocean going. But hypothesis that you know, that's proposed is that they came across by, uh, by boat just following the shore. You just same area as the bering strait. Yeah, you're just 100 feet off shore. You go in and, and, and, uh, most likely both. Right? And one of the issues of course was the short face bear was so formidable according to dan flores, that it would have been a huge impediment for people crossing on foot anyway. And short face bear went extinct right around tHe time we see more evidence of human beings entering in. But why did it go extinct? That's the big question. Well, you have to add that to the list of of predators that there would've been no reason for humans to have been hunting.

Speaker 7:          01:35:58       Yeah. Well, that's an enormous, enormous animals to factors that go on here. There's positive evidence in favor of a hypothesis. Then there's negative evidence against the mainstreams hypothesis and you really need both, so it's not enough to just say, I don't accept the evidence for here that, okay, that's fine. So I just do that all the time. What evidence? What do you. Let's be, let's be speak in specifics because you keep doing this. You keep saying, well, they find things and it turns out no, that's not true. When you're essentially proving your point of being a skeptic without having any real cases. Well and just keep saying that all of the cases, but no, you're not saying you can't say all the cases. If you don't want to cite anything specifically, don't keep bringing up things that are refuted because you don't have anything that you're pointing to, so you're just muddying the water.

Speaker 7:          01:36:40       Okay. You're essentially pissing in the pool. None of the clovis thing. For example, go back to the pyramids. All of these, what's been disproved? Okay, I'm making a different slightly different point. That's the problem that you're not addressing the actual issues we're talking about. You muddy the water by saying things have been tossed out the window, so we have to be careful here and tossed these things out the window as well that toss out. Just contemplate them published in nature for example, so let's watch what happens to the hundred and 30,000 year old hypothesis if it if it holds up and there's other sites that are dated that way and so on and so forth, and that will be truly revolutionary and scientists would accept it.

Speaker 4:          01:37:20       You see, the problem is that when you have a very strong paradigm like clovis first, which really dominates american archeology, prehistoric archeology for very long period, it's difficult. It's difficult from a career point of view for archeologist to come up and proposal attentive sites. Those who did like tom dillehay let jack sunk. Mars paid a very heavy price for so doing so. The incentive to go looking for older stuff than clovis is extremely low. In the archaeological community as a result of this ferocious reaction that went on for 30 or 40 or even 50 years, you know, I mean can also considered the vasa kilo excavations in, in, in Mexico, uh, where, where the suggestion of some sort of human presence 230,000 years ago, I mean that good archeology, but it was utterly dismissed and the archeologists involved where were ruined for getting involved in that. It's hard to see how that's a profession that encourages people to think outside the box when careers get ruined and research funding gets withdrawn for an idea that doesn't fit the current mainstream.

Speaker 7:          01:38:23       We don't like to think that, that scientists do that. They do that. Are you familiar with michael kramer's book for bitten archeology? I know michael. Yeah. Okay. So now he makes in my mind as compelling a case as you do and for his humans were here tens of millions of years ago. And his book is young, 900 pages long, tens of millions, yet tens of millions. Okay. And he's a hindu. So his ideas, you know, this sort of long recycling and what evidence is it based on for tens of millions of years not here to defend michael kremer or to have a discussion about michael kremer. That's not why I'm sitting at this table, but my point is that michael primo is not me. That's right. So, but, but there's lots of alternative archeology was where I began. There's lots of alternative archeology books and what evidence is there to support that? None. So why you bringing up that when there's evidence that he's bringing up corrimos evidence is similar to his. It's mostly negative evidence that I don't accept the data. This, there is this peculiar sort of footprint looking thing.

Speaker 4:          01:39:26       Kramer refers specifically to the knowledge filter. The most useful thing about that book is the publication of reports, archeological surgical

Speaker 7:          01:39:33       reports which are no longer available to the public, which, which do suggest an alternative. But I would say it's a very useful book to read beyond that. I have nothing to say about. Right. So, but that's not necessarily true. You're saying his only evidence. We mean he's pointing to like some pretty significant evidence like this. The sphinx thing is a geologist from boston university propose this because of water erosion because of water erosion that could have only been done by thousands of years of rainfall in his opinion as a, as a qualified geologists and like that's not a lack of evidence. I understand, but why do no, no other geologists archaeologists other. No, that's not true. Actually they do and I've had multiple conversations with robert where he is cited the fact that he has gotten a considerable body of support from other geologists, not from egyptologist, but from geologists who do recognize the effects of severe water erosion on limestone carbonate rocks, and that's what we have there. We have severe water erosion, it appears and is preserved on the quarry walls around the sphinx. The sphinx itself, as graham said, is difficult to ascertain because of all of the reconstruction that has gone on, but the quarry walls, which would have once had the very distinct stepped profile of a typical quarry. I'm no longer have that. I mean they have now they have a

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       textbook profile, a parabolic profile that would be consistent with sheet flooding, which would be both disillusioned because carbonate rocks dissolve in acidic waters and what's called courageous, which was be the effects of water loaded with sand sediment, which would make it very rough, so if you've got the sand sediment flowing over the edge of what would have been a quarry wall, what you're going to end up with is a smoothing off of the rough corners and the final result would be a a very rounded profile like you see there and you would also see where the fissures in the rock would be selectively widened and opened by the water penetrating those fissures. I mean it, it has all the earmarks of a very textbook case of water erosion.

Speaker 7:          01:41:45       Don't you think? It's very diSingenuous comparing that to someone who thinks that human beings have been here for tens of millions of years with no evidence to support it whatsoever. He doesn't say he. Of course he doesn't say he has no evidence. He has a 900 page book full of evidence. It's the quality of the evidence. What about the quality of that evidence? It's okay if it was that good. You know, we're not geologist sitting here. If it was that good, why don't geologists look at it? Go. He's right. They do. They all do.

Speaker 4:          01:42:12       No. Some geologists who, some geologists who work with egyptologists say that shock is right.

Speaker 7:          01:42:18       We have a geologist on the line. Why don't we ask him, mark will. We can have one guy's opinion. We could also have other guys' opinions

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       and get this matter has been in what domain? Since 1992. It hasn't gone away. Sharks argument that we are looking at precipitation induced weathering on the sphinx has not been debunked. It has been opposed. It has been disagreed With, but that is different from saying it's deBunked and shock stays solid and strong on that issue. He is a credentialed geologist. He is a professor of geology at the university of boston. He has a right to speak out about this, and he stated his view. I happened to find this view very interesting, especially since it correlates with what I regard as the interesting astronomy of the site. I think that site has origins that do go back into the younger dryas. That's my opinion. I've stayed at many times and I've presented the evidence that I think underwrites that opinion. You and your colleagues are absolutely at liberty to disagree and you do.

Speaker 7:          01:43:16       You don't think it's disingenuous to compare that to someone who says something that defies our current understanding of human beings and the the, the, the actual evolution of humans. But you're talking about someone who's saying that human beings, how many millions of years old, tens of millions. Tens of millions. Well, we know for a fact, right? As far if you pay attention evolution. Right, but that's what we weren't even humans a million years ago. Correct. I meAn, there are creationists who think, okay, we're not talking about them. We're talking about grandma. I know, but my point was that, so here you have the mainstream scientists. There's graham. He seemed so reasonable, but there's 50 him

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       and each of them thinks that they're there. Right? They're not

Speaker 3:          01:43:55       visual language. he seems so reasonable. Right? So you're right there. You're accusing me of dissimulation. The subtext is that I'm not. And then there's 50 patronized, arrogant. I don't mean deeply unpleasant and personal approach. I'm sorry I didn't.

Speaker 5:          01:44:10       I mean it to sound like that. I really don't. Okay. Okay. I have a larger point that you accepted that when you're faced with a bunch of different alternative theories that are coming in and it's not safe to take physics. I mean every physicist like you just had lawrence krauss, he gets these letters daily of people saying, I think I figured out why einstein was wrong and he can't address them all. And, and, and they're smart people. They're thoughtful people. They really believe it. What do you do with that?

Speaker 3:          01:44:39       That's my point and I feel that's not my problem. And if there are alternative, the other alternative theories, that's not my problem either. It's the problem for the mainstream to sort it out and figure which to pay attention to in which, well, I'm suspicious of this whole idea of the mainstream because even looking into mainstream, you find so many divergent points of view that I, you know, I think that's basically a fiction that there is this mainstream that has arrived at this consensus and that there are no alternative ulterior motives there and that there are no dogmas that are being perpetuated there. you know, I mean, I look at the lot of the geological stuff in and realize that there are many different points of view when we talk about the, these floods at the end of the last ice age. There are many divergent points of view. There is what could be considered the mainstream yet even that has multiple interpretations.

Speaker 3:          01:45:33       And the same with this common idea. Um, you know, I mean, I don't know what constitutes the mainstream there because there had been a group that has opposed it at every turn, but at the same time, the group that accepts the comment hypothesis has continued to grow. In fact, there's even a number of, of individuals involved that set out specifically to to disprove it or discredited who are now basically on board and it has grown from being a small handful of scientists that are now 63 scientists from 55 different institutions that are on board with the idea that something remarkable happened at the end of the last ice age. It was probably exogenic meaning something from outside, something from space. There's no consensus as to exactly what that was, which would be normal because the, these discoveries are in their infancy at this point, but there's been an attempt to discredit the idea simply because that as the evidence has come in over the last decade, it has evolved in, in new mysteries have been opened up. Uh, as the evidence comes in and the claim is being made well, there's no consistent interpretation of this evidence and therefore we've debunked it. I mean, an example is pinta is rec. When pinterest dalton directly am for the younger impact

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       hypothesis. I mean, publish a paper in pen air saying requiem, suggesting that the impact hypothesis is already dead. That was in 2011. Every single one of pinch points have been responded to. Those who are critical of the younger dryas impact hypothesis rarely site. The fact that the so called refutations have themselves been refuted. That new information is constantly coming in. I see a very one sided game being played here with a group of academics who are determined to demonstrate that there could have been no possibility of anything like a comet impact 12,800 years ago and that these 63 or 65 scientists who are proposing that I just completely wrong and when they refute the reputations, I very rarely see though that that refer to our commented upon a tall. Again, your, your colleague, the defense has dismissed the younger dryas impact hypothesis without actually going in detail into the debate that's gone on.

Speaker 7:          01:47:44       Has this graph in his paper showing all these different dates for the.

Speaker 4:          01:47:50       That's from one of the critical papers. You know there's another side to this argument, so it needs to be. It needs to be listening to what the other side would say. Well, that's the point where maybe we should have mark come on and maybe we should have malcolm lecan come on as well because malcolm, the comp is actually one of those 63 younger dryas impact scientists. What is explained to me, people

Speaker 7:          01:48:08       that are just listening to this, what is this graph that you're showing? Well, this is the carbon 14 date ranges from samples taken from the younger dryas boundary. So this is the boundary here. And the point of this is that there's not a single consistent series of dates that would consistently show. Yep, absolutely. For sure. At every site it comes in, right there is that they bounce around a lot here. So now maybe mark, this is his area. He could come on and skype here and they bounce around and what's, what's the point of this for the lay person who's listening to this? Uh, well. So if you take the ones that are above the gray line, then those were, those are showing that something like an impact happened much earlier, much later and the ones below it or that it's much earlier. So where's the consistency of a single impact consistent across that middle of that group?

Speaker 7:          01:48:57       I don't think there's any argument. There was a single impact. In fact, there's a. There's arguments that there was no, there's more than one day. We're talking about a stretch of thousands of years and multiple impacts dress runs when random, 200 years. Randall, please, please give me your, your [inaudible]. You're the expert of this. Well, these are dates for the younger dryas. There's a big spread obviously, but there's also a lot of possibilities for introducing inaccuracies into the dating. The what's called the old wood effect can sometimes make, make it appear to be older than it is by a millennium or to millenium. But what we certainly do see here is a clustering right around 13,000 years ago. That looks pretty evident to me and everybody knows who does radio carbon dating, dating might have errors. And

Speaker 8:          01:49:47       in it, the one article I think that came out last year by james kenneth and 25 others was the by asian chronological analysis consistent with synchronous age of 12,835 to 12,735 calibrated years before present for younger dryas boundary on four continents. That's a refutation of precisely what it is. It's a representation of this does not refer to that reputation. Jamie, could you pull up a the age of leo? I think I gave that to you. And go to slide number one. 60 seven. Wow. One hundred and 67. And that that refers to the go to slide 167. Jesus, you're not fucking around 167 slides. Here we go.

Speaker 8:          01:50:47       Here we go. A cosmic impact event at 12,800 calibrated years before present form the younger dryas boundary layer containing peak abundances in multiple high temperature impact related proxies including spirits, milk, glass and nano diamonds. Bayesian statistical analysis of 354 dates from 23 sedimentary sequences over four continents. Established a model younger dryas boundary age of 12,835 calibrated years before present, supporting a synchronicity of the younger dryas boundary layer at high probability, 95 percent. This range overlaps that have a platinum peak recorded in the greenland ice sheet to end of the onset of the younger dryas climate episode in six. Key records suggesting a causal connection between the impact of and younger dryas due to its rarity and distinctive characteristics. The younger dryas boundary layers proposed as a widespread correlation data. And randall, if I can remember what you said correctly, you believe that there was probably more than one significant impact over a period of several thousand years. Let me, let me pop in on that

Speaker 4:          01:51:46       clean. I don't mean to cut you off, but the, the, the. Let's be clear. The suggestion is that 12,000, 800 years ago, uh, there was a comments breakup into multiple parts. I mean, anybody who saw the shoemaker levy nine nasa films back in 1994 is aware that that comment broke up into more than 20 fragments, all of which hit jupiter. Sometimes creating explosions larger than the earth itself. All right, so I don't think it's controversial that comments break up into fragments and this is the suggestion of the younger dryas impact hypothesis that we're dealing with a giant comet that broke up into multiple fragments that orbits in the tour at media stream and that four of those fragments, that's the the the suggestion for largest fragments fell out of the taurid meteor stream coming in on a trajectory roughly northwest to southeast crossing the north american ice cap. And there there are up to four impact on the north american ice cap. The, the, the, the, the impact is then continue across the atlantic ocean. There's a suggestion of impacts

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       in Belgium and indeed as far east as aba herrera in Syria, it's a, it's a global event. Fifty dollars million square kilometers of the earth's surfaces is within the younger dryas boundary field. And so he really huge thing. So the suggestion is that there were multiple impacts at the beginning. Now the next question is what happened 11,000, 600 years ago when the younger dryas ends and global temperatures shoot up incredibly rapidly. And the science on that is much less advanced than the science on the beginning of the younger dryas. Fred hoyle back in the 19 eighties, was puzzled by the sudden temperature increase at the end of the younger dryas. And he suggested presciently I would say that, uh, this may have been caused by a comet impact in an ocean, so maybe other bits of the taurid meteor stream impacted the earth. other filaments within the stream impacted the earth 11,000, 600 years ago, or maybe something else caused it. I mean, robert schoch is in favor of extraordinary solar activity. Being responsible for that warming, we don't have to know, but that that's broadly the suggestion. We're at the beginning and the end that certainly impacts at the beginning, possibly impacts or other things at the, at the end

Speaker 3:          01:53:53       or club in napier and others don't. Can in other astronomers have speculated that there could be impact arrows epochs in which there's a, an enhanced possibility of the earth being impacted. Particularly if you have a large comet that enters into the solar system, begins to undergo a hierarchy of disintegrations and basically litters the inner solar system with the material. And We do know that the earth crosses the taurid meteor stream twice each year, once in late june, and um, once in late october, early november. And we know that the tongue cusco event of 19 oh, eight, which is not speculative, I mean that happened. It occurred on June 30th, which would have been the peak of the meteor shower. it also came from the direction of the sun, its, um, its position in space where we're emanate. It's radiant point in space from which it laminated at that time was totally consistent with the taurid meteor stream radiant.

Speaker 3:          01:54:53       So it's very possible that the, that the tone cusco event of 19, oh, eight was a member of that family of media rights. Um, and so, you know, that would be, again, we don't, there's no, nothing definitive there, but it would be a prime candidate for investigation that perhaps, and again I mentioned earlier, this goes back to the work of fred whipple way back in the 19 forties who began to research the target media stream and came to believe that it was much, much more active in, in the past than it is now. That it's an old diffuse meteor stream that at one time and like graham said, it has a multiple objects still within it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:32       KeY is the best known moment. That's a fragment.

Speaker 3:          01:55:36       Original original giant comet that they estimate might've been based upon the amount of materials

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       remnant in the zodiacal light cloud that perhaps it was somewhere around 60 miles or 100 kilometers in diameter.

Speaker 4:          01:55:53       And another thing that I'm, that I'm taken to task for is that I report the work of cuban napier and their suggested that the taurid meteor stream is actually fucking dangerous and that we should be paying attention to it. That it has been a hidden hand in human history in the past. And that it can cause us trouble in the future. Now this is not gloom and doom. We have the technology to deal with the large objects in the taurid meteor stream. If any filaments are on earth, an orbit that will result in impacts on the earth at the very least. It's extremely unwise of us not to pay attention to. I'm accused of being sort of a do monger and constantly predicting the end of the world and this and that. But actually I'm simply reporting astronomers who are very concerned about the tour with meteor stream and the possibility that we may face further impacts from it in the future. That's not wool wool. That is science, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:56:41       Absolutely. And I would agree with that and that. And that is a form of catastrophic ism that scientists accept as a very real well lots. I mean there's, you know, what, if anything, do you oppose about what they've just said? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing about the younger dryas period of just a technical question you had. Your slide was 12,800 on there. And so get directly. Typically the end of the oldest c 14 dates or whatnot, and 90 11,000 or 1200 year gap catastrophe. No, no. Go back to the tend to be very clear about

Speaker 4:          01:57:19       the younger dryas. One of the puzzling things about it is that you have cataclysm at the beginning and this global temperature slump is surely cataclysmic by any standards and you have cataclysm at the end. You have a massive spike, a huge increase in global temperatures, and you have meltwater pulse one b. You have a lot of water going into the ocean at that time. So both ends of the younger dryas. I cataclysmic and it's at the recent end of the younger dryas, 11,600 years ago that we seek out beckley tepi mysteriously

Speaker 5:          01:57:50       the popping up and I know you're a staunch opponent of atlantis and that you believe plato made atlantis up in order to make a political point and you may be right, but the date that plato puts on the submergence of atlantis is 11,600 years ago, 9,000 years before the time of soul on which happens to coincide with meltwater pulse. One b and the end of the younger dryas, which I would have thought would cause you to rethink your position on plato. Just a Little. Well, it's interesting. I'm open to the idea. I tend to read myths in the same way your guest Jordan Peterson does that, you know, it's a story to deliver some sort of moral homily to is it's a commentary on our own culture, our society. It's a way, a literary way of delivering a message to people. That's how I tend to read. Instead of reading them like let's see if we can figure out what happened historically, but those hard data, hard data in plato's, whatever you think it is and

Speaker 6:          01:58:41       that hot data is data, is that the submergence of atlanta's happened 9,000 years before the time of soul on that is a date that is 9,600 bc. That is 11,600 years ago. This to me is a strong reason why we shouldn't just completely dismissed plato's notion of a lost civilization of the idea. I mean the idea that say the parting of the red sea happened because of some impact. That's not, I'm not proposing that we don't go there, waste of time. Okay, but, but there are people that think that I don't or or that the plagues in the bible can be a waste of time, but deal with plato. Alright. So, but my point is that some of them may have historical origins, some of them may be completely made up this mythic stories for some other reason. You have to take them one at a time, in my opinion, to plato.

Speaker 6:          01:59:25       One is a commentary on his own culture of athens and being too bellicose being too warlike and then this is not good for where we're going. That's my opinion. and the fact that he picks a date that coincides with the geologically significant date of flooding is not really going to change your opinion. I think. Well, I think again, that's pretty amazing coincidence is it? I mean, we're finding that connection that plato, plato said that was an advanced civilization with advanced agriculture, advanced architecture, advanced navigational abilities which was submerged by the sea, swept from the face of the earth so that mankind had to begin again, like children with no memory of what went before. And lo and behold, he puts a Geologically significant data on that date that we ourselves have only known as significant in the last 20 or 30 years. So where is this place?

Speaker 6:          02:00:20       This atlantis? I mean, so as you know, there's online problem, there's a, there's a long history of people speculating. If we found a site that would be a big plus, go do more marine archeology. Well if we, if we take it literally, obviously then it's below the ocean. But you know, I don't necessarily take plato's account literally, but I do say, well, it's rather coincidental that he, his dating falls exactly on meltwater pulse one b when we know there was this huge influx of water into the ocean. And also, if we look at the, his geography, it, it's interesting because he cites, you know, basically a landmass west of the pillars of police, which is pillars of hercules, the straits of gibraltar, and he places this in centrally intermittent atlantic. Um, I tHink it was cramped or one of the comp the, the commentators on, on him that said it was something like three or four days say a west. But if you look there, there is a sunken landmass that sank at the end of the last ice age because of the rapidly rising sea level. And this has been well established by marine geology looking at evidence that, that the [inaudible] plateau underwent an isostatic subsidence which would have been resulting from the rapidly rising sea level. We know there's no doubt that the north american continent has rebounded iso statically after the removal of

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       this tremendous mass of ice that, that mantle north America up to anywhere from a thousand to possibly 1500 feet. Well, if you, if you do a comparable isostatic adjustment of the mid atlantic ridge, you'll find that the asrs island complex are much, much larger. And it turns out that that might actually be a nice place to develop a least a maritime culture. Something along the lines of the phoenicians are the minoans during the period of the ice age. Because during the period of the ash, the climate of the world was so much different than now know the great basin area was filled with huge lakes vegetation, forest, savannah and grasslands, like graham said, with the lowered sea level, there were a much larger areas of the coastline your were exposed. Um, and that's probably where most of people, what resided during the ice ages near the coast lines, because that would have been the most benevolent place with the rising of the sea level.

Speaker 3:          02:02:39       All of that's lost. And there's nothing really fringed about saying, well, people might have lived on islands in the mid atlantic, especially when we know that the, that those islands most likely had a, a benevolent climate during the ice age. So I, I don't go into crystal technology and flying machines or whatever, all of this speculative stuff that has created to it. But if we just keep it simple and say, well, is it possible that a culture along the lines of the minoans or the finish [inaudible] could have existed? Could they have existed on an island culture and admitted atlantic? And there's nothing really extreme about that idea in my mind.

Speaker 4:          02:03:21       Even the idea that a more advanced, sophisticated technological technological culture coexisted with hunter gatherers isn't too strange. I mean sanctuary do. So today we coexist with hunter gatherers in the amazon jungle who don't even know we exist. I mean, so I don't see. I don't see why a priority. That's just an impossible idea to look my misremembering that you in your book, you mentioned Indonesia as a site for atlantis. I mentioned, I mentioned gunung padang, not as a site for atlantis. That's danny hilman nutter with Georgia who is a geologist, is indonesia's leading expert in megathrust earthquakes. As a matter of fact, he has written a book proposing that Indonesia was atlantis and the gunung padang, which he's been involved in investigating a, is a site of fromm atlantean times danny has done. He has proposed that. Now, what's interesting about Indonesia is that Indonesia sits upon the sunda shelf and the sunda shelf was one of the parts of the world that was most massively flooded at the end of the ice age mean if you go back to the end of the.

Speaker 4:          02:04:22       I sAid you're not looking at the malaysian peninsula, you're not looking at the indonesian islands out going out towards the Philippines. You're looking at a giant continent sized landmass, all of which went a underwater at the end of the last ice age really rather rapidly. So, uh, I think he has a, I think it's an interesting. It's one of those areas in the world where there was very large scale flooding, huge amounts of land were swallowed up. Also, the connection of Australia to new Guinea during the ice age was also washed away. There's, there's, there's a whole range of issues regarding sea level rise in that very area which anybody with an interest in these subjects should be paying attention to. so it's quite possible that, like today, many of them,

Speaker 7:          02:05:00       van civilizations of today are on the water, whether it's New York or los angeles. And that was probably the case back then, and so the idea of atlanta's might not have been about one particular area, but many advanced areas that were wiped out along with their knowledge. YeAh. So the thesis of that book, I mentioned noah's flood, that the two geologIsts with the black seat, the theory that there were rimmed with small villages and the massive flooding almost instantly wiped out and then that gets passed down as the oral tradition is these myths. To me that's a totally reasonable, totally reasonable. Well, when we get into more discussion about the actual impact hypothesis and the mega flooding so that we can get our statement by gettIng them involved. What is your geologists? You are geologists, you're by yourself, and there's two of them. What is only fair, right?

Speaker 7:          02:05:53       What is your geologists opposed to what randall and grammar proposing? I think it's the On the impact hypothesis versus the multiple glacial dams that burst over periods of time like that had that slide. Okay. Well let'S call him up and get him on skype and we've never done tHis before, so this might suck. Well, hopefully it'll work. This slide here he is showing these are each independent carbon, 14 dates of these different instant floods in north America from each individual ice dams. And what separates these dates? They're separated by, it looks like from 20,000 to 12,000. So all before the impact. Well, 12,800 wasn't that marks on the line? What is this? Mark would mark, can you hear us mark that mark defense. Thank you very much for doing this. We really appreciate you coming on here. It's my pleasure. Uh, so you've had a chance to listen to these guys talk. what is your thoughts just stepping into this cold?

Speaker 4:          02:07:05       Well, first of all, I did not mean to upset Mr. Hancock. He seemed to be quite disturbed and I apologize it's not disturbed him. No, no you haven't. You haven't disturbed me and I'm not, I'm not upset. It's just simply that you're extremely selective in what you present In your, in your draft, admittedly draft article that you've chosen to put online. Uh, you don't represent. You don't represent me accurately and answer his question because I know we're getting short on time. Oh, no, no. We're putting up plenty of time. We have plenty of time.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       Okay. Well, first of all tonight,

Speaker 9:          02:07:39       would you allow me just to address a go beckley, tempe for a minute?

Speaker 2:          02:07:44       Sure. Would you like to address the article first? I think that probably would be the most fair since we just brought that up. Okay. I'm sorry, what was the question then? Graham? Well, the, I, I read that on their various passages in your article where you misrepresent me. I'm sorry. No, I didn't rent misrepresenting. You didn't misrepresent me. okay.

Speaker 9:          02:08:09       You said that. I did. I said that,

Speaker 2:          02:08:11       uh, uh,

Speaker 9:          02:08:13       that I was actually talking about someone in Indonesia when I said you didn't understand newton's physics.

Speaker 2:          02:08:19       No, I'm sorry. I didn't say. I didn't say you were talking about someone in Indonesia. I said you were talking about. Hey susan. Hey susan. Hey, seuss gomorrah in, um, in Peru is who I was talking about and hey, suze tamara does have very exotic views on gravitation, which I stayed seriously or not my interest. I do say he may be right, but I don't say he's right. I say, this is not my interest, and I go onto say what my interest in his work. You pick it back up.

Speaker 9:          02:08:47       You're drowning me out here. I was asked to explain whether or not I thought I was misleading and I don't think I was misleading. You can clearly state in there that may be gravity was due to the way we've changed orbits around the sun. Gravity is not due to that. It's due to mass and the inverse

Speaker 2:          02:09:07       of what? What do you mean? I don't state that. Hey, sue states that and I say I disagree with it. Oh, come on.

Speaker 9:          02:09:17       I want to be respectful. I can't really hear you when I'm talking. I apologize, but I feel like you've. You are selecting you selectively changing the meaning of what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          02:09:30       Well, why don't you. Why don't you quote me as these words from my text what you say that I buy the gravity thing of, hey, suze gomorrah, why don't you quote me when I say the opposite of what I go on to say, not quoted in the attack is the following quote. However, this isn't the part of his theory. I'm interested in where I feel he is solidly persuasive, is in his observations of the anomalous character of the monuments of the andes. I am not putting anything on. Hey, suze gomorrah's gravitational ideas. I am saying very clearly what it is in his approach that I am interested in. I'm not going to dismiss all of his approach because he has an approach on gravity that you don't like, that's not even of interest to me, and I say so in the book. You don't report that. Therefore I suggest you misrepresented me.

Speaker 9:          02:10:22       Mr. Hancock. What I brought up him for was simply state that you didn't understand, and I say it right there. Did you don't understand newton's physics, but

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       I'm not even talking about. I'm not talking about just if you don't understand newton's physics, not newt. If I wished, if I wished to make an argument about gravity, I wouldn't go saying that. That isn't the part of hey suits, gomorrah's theory that I'm interested in. I'm interested in the other aspect of his work. His observations through

Speaker 9:          02:10:55       feels that way. My point was simply to point out that you didn't understand the mechanics.

Speaker 2:          02:11:01       Stop wasting time here

Speaker 7:          02:11:03       for grant. We the way the article is on a second. Hold on, let these guys talk about. We did misrepresent him. We did. The way the sentence is structured, it's clearly out of context. We're changing. We're going to change. That waS taken out of context and that's what I'm objecting. I'm not sure why he included in the book in the first place, but he's not arguing about the gravity at all. so we will fix that. Maybe we can get straight to the flooding thing that, uh, that song talking about graham is fine with that. I mean, graham, I know there was something.

Speaker 2:          02:11:33       The other thing that I find to be misrepresenting his statement yet hancock makes the following stunning claim quote, our ancestors are being initiated into the secrets of metals. And how to make swords and knives. What marked the fat does not tell his readers is that I make that claim. I don't make that claim. I am actually reporting what is said in the book of enoch. That's not me who say we will the book of enoch grand. We'll fix it. Okay. Otherwise, let's get. Let's get back to the main narrative. This for god's sake. okay. Just give me the list of them

Speaker 7:          02:12:08       things that will fix it becaUse that's not the point of that. Well, mark, you're obviously very critical of graham's work and maybe erroneouSly. So. But let's, let's get to what you think about what you've heard so far.

Speaker 9:          02:12:25       Alright, mr rogan. I don't want to come across as pompous scientists. What I want to do is I want to protect people from these grandiose a assumptions graham and his first Mr. Hancock and his first book. Please call me grandma. Please call me. Grab. Okay. Graham and his first book in fingerprints a suggested that that there was a, a continent where the civilization lived and through some machinations, this continent of went south and, and ended up destroying that civilization. Will as a geologist that that's just, that's just nonsense and now he comes back and he wants us to believe that he was all wrong and then all of a sudden it's okay now to believe in common strikes to kill this. This famous civilization not supposed to exist was duping. People not know if he means to do it. He seems to be doofy mock. Oh my I work

Speaker 2:          02:13:26       is in print and online. I mean I see the. I gather that you see your role as a protector for the public. Obviously you feel that the public are not intelligent enough to make discerning decisions of their own in this respect. However, to address that the public doesn't understand the science. Okay, so to the degree that you're misrepresented, so they need the superior knowledge of mock defense in order to understandable finding. They need the knowledge of sine. Okay. Well that's okay. Knowledge that I have. Let me come to your point, which is you're saying that I proposed one mechanism for cataclysm and fingerprints of the gods and that I'm proposing another mechanism for cataclysm today. What I proposed in fingerprints of the gods was that there had been a gigantic cataclysm in the ballpark of 12,500 years ago. I looked at a number of possibilities of which the most striking to me at the time was earth crust, displacement and earth crust.

Speaker 2:          02:14:18       Displacement is reported, is the work of charles hapgood, not my work, but I do report it in fingerprints of the gods as an excellent theory, which explains the information. Since I wrote fingerprints of the gods. I've learned a lot. I've learned a lot and I wouldn't want to defend that theory strongly today. I don't know if you have bought the latest edition of my book, the paperback edition of magicians of the gods, but it contains a chapter saying whatever happened to earth crust displacement. I addressed the change of view in this and I think I have a right to change my view and I think it's. It's healthy that, I mean why would I stick permanently to a view that I hold in 1995? If new evidence persuades me that it's wrong. I'm sure that's a good thing. Not a bad thing, and I'm fundamental proposition is we had a massive global cataclysm in the ballpark of 12,000, 500 years ago, so naturally it's of great interest to me when a large group of scientists, more than 60 of them over a period of more than 10 years now present evidence of a massive cognitive impact event 12,000, 800 years ago.

Speaker 2:          02:15:19       Exactly the way you are applying that. There are a lot of people are to believe in this. There are, there are some people that believe in it. I agree, but for the most part, I think, uh, taking an honest view, the common hypothesis has gotten to vote well, that's complete rubbish. Complete rubbish would also point out that in fingerprints you had people believing that the end of the world was coming in 2012. How am I supposed to take you seriously when you say things like that and then change your mind and we can all be done by now. I have absolutely changed my mind on the mayan calendar. Uh, I regard the mayan calendar as an interesting technological artifact with a better estimate of the length of the solar year. Then the estimate that we have with us today, the mayan calendar is based primarily on the position of the sun amongst the constellations at the winter solstice, and we are in an eight year window when the sun sits astride the dark rift of the milky way between the constellations of sagittarius and scorpio on the winter solstice. That window is 80 years wide. So the story of the mind calendar by the way, isn't actually quite over yet, but I'm not. I'm means

Speaker 9:          02:16:30       yes, I know exactly what precession means. Okay. Well, all of this stuff that you claim is on a procession of procession is the, is the, the earth spinning like a top, don't teach with running through comic clouds. and yet you're saying that somehow we're on some sort of cycle where the comments are going to come back and strike the earth. Uh, right now, sometime during the next 40 years. That's what you said in magicians. Now that's what, that's what? That's what [inaudible] club and bill napier and emilio sporadic carto say I'm new. You're the one who said it in your book. You just got all over. Mr. Michael shermer for, for saying the same things about other people. I want to know what you think, but mark told me what you think. I am a reporter and I make it very clear that you're talking to them about signs mark.

Speaker 9:          02:17:22       We got to. We can't talk over each other. I'm a reporter and it is my job to report the work of other people and I report the work of viktor club, bill napier and emilio, aesthetic carto, all of whom draw attention to the taurid meteor stream and who regarded as the greatest collision hazard facing the earth at this time and who specifically indicate that we may run into a filament of the taurid meteor stream in the next 30 years. That is going to be very bad for our civilization. It's not my thing to do with precision. When, when did I say it had anything to do with procession? You have a whole session in magicians. Indeed as a clock, as a timer, as a way of going back through the ages, but I'm not saying precession is causing this encounter with the taurid meteor stream and go find the paragraph where I say, no, no, no.

Speaker 9:          02:18:09       What you're saying is that we're on a cycle. The 12,000 years ago this civilization was destroyed and now you're saying, oh, that civilization was so smart that they knew we were going to go through another shower and we're all doomed in the next 40 years. You didn't say doomed and in magicians like you did in fingerprints, but we must conclude that that's your opinion because I don't know anybody else that you referenced on that issue. Well, it has nothing to do with that. It's not even on that cycle. I never saw a cycle of about 21,000 years. Twenty five cycles per session. Twenty 5,920 years. Actually, it's not awful. Precession one degree every 72 years. Give or take a small margin. That is the precession, the teaching grandma to suck eggs here. So anyway, I guess this has just been going on all day. You can't criticize michael for bringing up other people and we're saying strange things and compare and say, oh no, you can't say that because it's not about me. It's not true. You're. You're doing the same thing. You're reporting about other people and saying, nonsense. I'm reporting the work of viktor clue. Bill napier and emilia, sped carto. I also indicate that I strongly support that work. That's as far as I go. Mark is if I could

Speaker 2:          02:19:27       stop you here. So you think that this comment wiping out all the ice age megafauna theory has been debunked? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 9:          02:19:36       No sir. I have not seen that. Well, I think that if you read the literature carefully, the majority of scientists right now, and I know that this is still going, you know what I like about the common people, is that they're doing it in the scientifically right way. They're getting people to review the material. They're getting people to go through that gauntlet to where they get criticized and they make sure that they do things right and to get it out there. Firestone did this in 2007. He was crucified. He's come back, his, his group has come back with a lot of good stuff, so I want to wait and see this play out. I said I didn't like paper that we're going to have to wait to get a conclusion here. So I'm not saying that they're wrong, but right now if I read the literature as a scientist, I have to say that the comment guys are, are, are getting hit pretty hard.

Speaker 2:          02:20:24       What do you take? What do you make of the latest platinum paper in nature? Scientific reports, the platinum anomaly across north America and it's coincidence in time with the greenland ice cores and the platinum anomaly there. What do you say to that?

Speaker 9:          02:20:36       Well, I say that and maybe we can bring him on. The problem with that is, is that what does platinum have to do with the common, you know, platinums are high and asteroids, but they're not high in comments. Comments are icy bodies. I saw the paper, I read it. Um, I think it's interesting, but I can't for the life of me figure out how he's correlating it and he has in, in the different areas of the clovis, he has platinum concentrations that are, that, that are seemingly not matching up there outside the younger dryas, other inside the younger dryas. I'd like to, I'd like you to show them to understand what he's trying to say. It doesn't refute the common hypothesis.

Speaker 2:          02:21:18       Let's bring malcolm on since he's one of the coauthors of the platinum paper. This is going to get super complicated, but let's try it one color at a time. We could only do one color at a time apparently, but I think my malcolm, you know, should, should, should have it.

Speaker 9:          02:21:32       I don't want to criticize him if he can't be here. That's okay. You can talk a little bit if I may, about a go go beckley, tempe, because I've read a schmidt. I know that schmidt never ever found anything to suggest that there were anything in the early part of beckley, tippy that, that we're not hunter gatherers. They all were hunter gatherers. You know, he found 20. I think I, I may be wrong on this, but I think he found 22,000 stone tools there. Uh, when he dug that place up, any domesticated animals, he never found any domesticated grain. The, he found tons of bones of animals. So we know that about 100 to 200 people were probably working on go back to the top at one time and they were fed by wild animals and grain. So there's no reason to go out on a limb here and say that some magical civilization

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       came in. And by the way, that's another thing that drives me crazy. You're saying that these guys were magicians. You're saying that they had secret knowledge. What possible secret knowledge that they give to the people that go back to tibi. How can you possibly not saying that the word magicians of the gods comes from the app kalu in ancient sumeria and they were considered to have superior powers that they were considered to be magicians have a salt. Am I? Should I not report that? Because it's there in the sumerian text, you should tell us what michael's been asking all day is what were their super powers. I'm not saying that they had super powers this the sumerians who said that I simply report that you can regard that as a cop out if you like, but I am a fucking reporter book magicians of the gods because that's the direct implication of the blue.

Speaker 2:          02:23:09       They were the magicians of the calls. Like you're saying they had magical powers to me. No, I'm saying that they were the magicians of the gods as they were called in an ancient culture. That's all. I just want your audience to know. That schmidt who worked there for 20 years that had didn't go there for two days and look around and take some notes and leaving on a book on it. He worked there for 20 years and he found date with dates and everything. He found that there were hunter gatherers. They're building those mega list just like you went to. If you went to easter island, can be found the ali and, and you said, oh my gosh, there must have been some secret civilization that made these milan because stupid hunter gatherers couldn't possibly make these will. We know that there were no special people on easter island.

Speaker 2:          02:23:53       It had to be made by a hunter gathers. Why would you poopoo uh, sorry. Are you saying I have to call it. Are you serious? Are you seriously saying that the inhabitants of easter island were hunter gatherers? Oh, absolutely. And if fatter effect, we saw that little island in the pacific ocean, the pacific ocean until about 1000 years ago on hold on to until about 1000 years ago. What do you think they hold a big civilization mark? Please let them respond. Go ahead. Well, first of all, have you met claire? Did you meet klaus schmidt? Do you know him personally? You know that I haven't met him. Okay, well, I did meet him. I do know him personally. I did record. I did record my interviews with him with his agreement and and what he states clearly I don't disagree with you that the people around go back to tempe, were hunter gatherers when go back to tempe was started.

Speaker 2:          02:24:47       What precisely intrigued klaus smith was the possibility, his praise, not mine, that got back. Lee tappy was a center of innovation, a place where new ideas were deliberately seeded in spread out in the population. I have klaus schmidt on record saying that I quote him saying that in my book and that to me is a very interesting proposition because it suggests that we have a site here that is being used to mobilize the population and to transfer to theM, but knowledge of agriculture which suddenly appears around go back at the time that go back to the tappc is functioning. What do you mean by that? What I mean by what I mean by suddenly it's klaus schmidt bet stated very clearly that these are the people that very same people who made go back to tempe and claw schmidt's view are the people who quote unquote invented agriculture. If you don't mind me interrupting here for a second, what about easter island? Was easter island established by a hunter gatherers or not? You were saying no. You say it was established by a hunter gatherer. As I say, not. I say easter harlem was an agricultural society. What's that? What's that? Hunt and gather on a tiny island. Have you been to easter island? I have six times and you know, you can walk across it in three hours. What's that? A hunt and gather on that.

Speaker 9:          02:26:00       Oh no, you're misunderstanding my point. These are not sophisticated people. Okay. But sorry, you sat and go quickly tapping. I think that you got it right. In fact it's a unesco site. We all recognize how important it is, but what, what, what I think michael and I can understand is how this ties into some, some magnificent civilization. There's nothing there that indicates that they were influenced by some other civilization except that they started out as hunter gatherers and then they evolved into a, um, an agricultural society. And that's what makes it a great site.

Speaker 2:          02:26:37       Can I answer you? You are seriously saying that there's nothing there. I mean, the largest megalithic site on earth, 7,000 years older than stonehenge is there. There's no background to it. No evidence of practice or the megalithic site itself is the problem for me.

Speaker 9:          02:26:53       Okay. I honestly, we've got mega list in quite a few sites and by the way, you're right, there's a mega list just down the road from go beckley, tippy, and they're probably so that several other. I can see them on maps and we need to get to the wonderful amount of work to do there. You bet. So I think grammar is good. Agreement is, is that I don't think that there's any, any need to call upon this great civilization that you, you say exist. well,

Speaker 2:          02:27:20       to me the simplest explanation is a transfer of knowledge transfer of technology. I've been writing about the possibility of a lost civilization for more than quarter of a century. That's what I do. I hope that it's a useful contribution to the debate. I mean, archeologists can choose not to listen to anything I say to dismiss me as a complete lunatic as they often do. To accuse me as you do in writing of duping, the public of conning, the public and so on and so forth. When you did use the word conning, actually it's in the very last paragraph of your article because I got it right here in front of me. We will fix it.

Speaker 9:          02:27:56       This was the first thing I wrote. I just put it up for my students.

Speaker 2:          02:27:59       Well, it's there. Well wait, hold on. I am. I am left with what I'm left with. Is that hancock? Am I going to put my reading glasses on so I can read this properly? What I am left with is quoting you, mark, is that hancock has a real knack for wanting a hellacious number of people into buying his books mean that's a direct

Speaker 9:          02:28:22       ad hominem insults. it's online. In your article, do you stand by it or not, but listen, I apologize to you for the use of that language. Just don't want you to. Because I do, but you used it in the first place. I think you're misleading your students. Why would you say that? You're just putting that online for your students as if that's not a big deal. You're putting it on the internet. It'S a salient just putting it online for your students and you've been proven incorrect. And how many different times in this article now? Well, about seven, correct. I haven't been proven incorrect. Well, you have, you misquote, you don't give the context. The neva guy. Even michael and even michael has said that the skeptic article will not, will not reflect these outer context statements that you're making here.

Speaker 5:          02:29:07       Right? So the core is, is the impact hypothesis likely to be true or not? And as an independent phenomenon, is it connected to go directly to epi in the younger dryas? I mean, that's kind of what we're getting at. So then we can, maybe you can explain that graph that shows all of the glacial dam bursts and the dating of those as, as thousands of years before the 12,800 year impact.

Speaker 9:          02:29:36       Yeah. We need To know that you guys get into

Speaker 5:          02:29:38       what does that, what does that mean? Well, which map is at which map on your, um, which map mark?

Speaker 9:          02:29:47       Uh, I'm sorry, it's the glacial map of western Washington or Washington state.

Speaker 5:          02:29:53       Yeah. Jamie, I'll put it up.

Speaker 9:          02:29:57       This is, by the way up. I should to protect michael here. I, I submitted this. Michael made immense amount of changes on that paper. I put it up because I wanted my students to see it. I had no idea that people would go online and look at that like you and unfortunately you've sent tens of thousands of people. Probably two of my letting them know it's on here and I'm sorry for that. Is it okay to just put that up online for your students? How come you don't have any problem with that? But you do have a problem with it as it stands being released to the general public? Um, well, you know, maybe it was like a nice stand by everything I said except for the personal comment at the end. Well, we'll see.

Speaker 5:          02:30:44       Yeah, let's, let's put up this mess. Good at. Back to the map.

Speaker 9:          02:30:49       Okay. The brown areas are now I have to emphasize that, that the scab lands is very famous. People have been working on geologists have been working on this for more than a hundred years I bet, and very intricate detailed mapping and we now know what areas have been flooded that's in the brown. The green areas are the old glacial lakes. Uh, one of them you can see is the columbia lake and the other one on the far right over in Montana. That's lake missoula. Now I guess my point here is, is that you guys want to make the flooding out here to be immense and I think brits original idea was that there was this one flooding, but then brex came to, to understand after looking at the data and all of the geology geologic work, that it wasn't just one flood, that it's many floods. And that was the point of all of those dates that I show you that there were, there had been at least 17 specific floods dated.

Speaker 9:          02:31:53       There are probably as many as 40 to 50 floods out there and they're all probably related to a glacier dams breaking. Now. Where in the world would you ever say that this small area relative to an entire content, why would you say that this is evidence for a common strike? Common strike, not even the comment guys are saying that this flooding out here is related to a con because there are a large number of area, a very small number of, of area, actual area that is flooded. If you take a look now at my dates or not my dates but the dates. Um, do you have that michael? The one with.

Speaker 3:          02:32:36       We're going to bring that up. But uh, let's let randall carlson address you because he's, I mean he's, he's got a point that if you just look at if you can find your, your examination to this area, but the point is you've got evidence of mega flooding all around the eye sheet margin from the atlantic to the pacific. You've got the work of key kikuyu and lord in the midwestern states, South Dakota, North Dakota, eastern Montana. You've got massive spillways out there that discharged off the ice sheet. You have glacial river warren. That was undoubtedly a formed by most likely glacial lake agassi, and you've got the st croix river where I took graham a couple of years ago that had mega floods down. If there were mega floods down the Mississippi river, there was glacial lake Wisconsin that discharge down to Wisconsin river, left the wiSconsin dells. There are the finger lakes in New York that probably were created by a massive floods emanating off of that scholar scoured exactly right. They were scoured and they were probably scoured by subglacial floods that were coming under a high pressure because you know, you have the drumlin fields that are just to the south of them and I, you've probably seen the work of john sean, a fair beanie and bruce rainy and knows

Speaker 9:          02:34:01       Canada drones is crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:34:05       Well, why? Why would that be? Why would, how do you propose the gremliNs then were formed?

Speaker 9:          02:34:12       Oh, easily. Uh, these glaciers came forward and tops top the, the, the terminal moraine and spread to the moraines out to, into drones.

Speaker 3:          02:34:24       But how, I mean, you've got, you've got features that look like they're totally fluvial he produced. You have, they look like inverted motels. You look at the internal stratification. How does glaciers create internal stratification? I've looked at, I've looked at at numerous drum, I'm in Canada, I've looked at drum in New York state. I've looked at gremlins and probably a dozen different places and where you can see exposures you see stratification. You don't see if, if glaciers are grinding over a deformable sub straight, how is it that they produce anything other than a chaotic jumble of glacial till you can actually see layer and I've seen it myself and we can pull up pictures of it here in a minute and I'd like for you

Speaker 9:          02:35:11       explain to me you do that because I'm not disagreeing with you a drama and by definition is made up of till I think we're getting kind of technical for this audience, but you know an esker is something that's stratified, not adrenaline. You're missing. You're missing identifying them as drumline.

Speaker 3:          02:35:27       No, I am not misidentifying gremlins. I know very clearly the difference between an asker and a drama and I've looked at many askers. I've hiked on him. I put sloan over him in the finger lakes or gouged. They are gouged. Yes. Are they gagged by glaciers or are they also gouged by subglacial mega floods? That's the question in that. I think that's a fair question to ask and if we look at some of the studies, we find out that the, that the depositional material in them is massive. It's not stratified. It's massive, is if it Was dumped in there over a very short period of time.

Speaker 9:          02:36:03       Let me go back to the, uh, to, to the bigger picture, but hold on a second, but what's your point about that?

Speaker 3:          02:36:12       The, I'm sorry. Respond to that. What he just said.

Speaker 9:          02:36:15       What am I responding to? Oh, look, we're going to have to disagree. I mean, what am I supposed to argue? I don't want to get into an argument with him here. Keith thinks that they're done by water. I entered the traditionally the way most geologists seed the grit the finger lakes is there out there are parallel to one another if, if he thinks it's water. Okay, what can we do? We can disagree. I guess. Let me go back up to the, to the main glacier of the glacier, while he broke her, suggested in nine in the nineties, uh, that water, uh, potentially, uh, was changed from flowing down the Mississippi valley into the atlantic or the arctic. No one has been able to find any evidence of flooding towards the atlantic or regarding. So when you say there are all kinds of evidence of flooding up there, wally broecker backed off of his, of his theory because we couldn't find any flooding.

Speaker 3:          02:37:08       Why he backed off of was the idea that the draining of glacial lake agassi triggered the younger dryas because they, the, the dating of the draining of glacial lake agassi was post younger dryas, and so that's what he backed off of him

Speaker 9:          02:37:23       necessarily because look, we know that there were, that, there were somewhere and then carefully dayton carefully math. You can watch the old tide glacier move back lorraine after lorraine, and there are no holes in that moraine that, that suggests flooding. There's no change in the lake levels of lake agassi. There's no evidence there. Oh, randall, for flooding. you've got it wrong. If you look at the mapping that the careful mapping that the geologists have done,

Speaker 3:          02:37:51       you've just said that there was no change in the level of lake agassi. How is that possible? I mean, as the ice receded, the glacial lake agathy expanded and at some point that finally breached right there at my big stone lake in Minnesota and basically carved out the Minnesota river valley, which geological studies have confirmed. They call it a river warren, and he confirmed it. Essentially it was carrying it's pake. Peak discharge was roughly 4,000 times greater than the modern Minnesota river that flows there to the Mississippi. The Mississippi then conveyed that water into the gulf of Mexico and deposited huge amounts of delta material that new orleans is built on. Now

Speaker 9:          02:38:36       you know you're trying to make a flood or a flood isn't. There's a difference between a glacier melting which causes a lot of water and a comment striking which cases creates copious amounts of water. I think you guys referred to it. The last time is a tsunami. There is no evidence of a tsunami in north America. Have you been? Finally, here's another question. Why do you guys, why aren't you guys talking about north America when you're atlanta? This is supposed to be in Egypt or are you guys have run around? You found some evidence of flooding in north America and somehow this relates to a destruction of atlantis in some lost civilization.

Speaker 3:          02:39:17       That's what I'm talking about now. I'm not talking about that. We know there was a fan of scan dni sheet. We know there was a core dni sheet. We know there was a laurentide ice sheet. We know they all melted. We know that there was somewhere around 6 million cubic miles oF ice wrapped up in those, in those ice sheets at the end of the late glacial maximum. They're all gone now. they had to melt. That was an enormous amount of water and I don't know if you have been out to the scab lands. I've been going back to the scab lands and the area of glacial lake missoula since 1970. I've been across That thing 60,000 miles back and forth. I have over 10,000 photographs of the material in the field and I can tell you those floods were enormous. They were

Speaker 9:          02:40:00       beyond your cherry picking. Look at the map. You shown some pictures. You know we can measure those current ripple marks that you'd show. We can measure how much water went over. All you have to do is measure the current ripples. You can go into cameras

Speaker 3:          02:40:13       prairie and you've got a current ripple field there that is about seven miles long.

Speaker 9:          02:40:18       I know it very well.

Speaker 3:          02:40:19       Okay. And the high watermark and narrows at 4,000, 200 feet above sea level. The floor of cameras, prairie is just 1400 feet lower than that. So we know that there were 1400 feet of water that pass through canvas prairie and down into the

Speaker 9:          02:40:35       flathead river. No, we don't. Because regarding. Are you disregarding the high water mark? The bottom of the bottom of the canyon to the top of the canyon is not what it was when the water first started flowing in that area. You caN't take the bottom of the canyon and say, oh, there must have been 4,000 feet of water here.

Speaker 3:          02:40:53       I'm not talking about a canyon. I'm talking about cameras. Prairie basin, which is not a canyon. It's a base of road at one time. Well most of the material in near was washed in, so I mean we don't know how much it would have eroded until somebody does some core samples to get down to something that can be dated to earlier delayed glacial maximum. But the floor of camus prairie is, is thick layers of very coarse gravel boulders and this is what composes the, the current ripples that you see there. I mean, I, I don't see how you can look at those current ripples that are sometimes 40 and 50 feet in amplitude with two and 300 feet cord length and say that that wasn't a catastrophic flow.

Speaker 9:          02:41:34       Maybe it wasn't. It was a catastrophic flood, but it wasn't like a tsunami. Then how would you characterize your, and we can, you know, we can do, we can play this game. Are you saying there are every geologists on the planet practically says that there were about 40 different floods until you came along

Speaker 3:          02:41:58       familiar with the workday and victor baker or ruSsell bunker or a number of others that have challenged the 40 floods hypothesis and. And are you going to tell me that those current ripples in cameras prairie are created? They're, they're the product of 40 separate floods.

Speaker 9:          02:42:13       Oh, absolutely. In fact, when you show me your pictures, I could see the flow changes in that. Oh, don't give me the year and credulous stuff doesn't mean you're right. You do the credit us all the time. Mark. Well, so let's say some pretty incredible flood

Speaker 3:          02:42:30       is created. The cameras prairie. I want, that's what you're saying. That's, that's the product of 40 separate floods.

Speaker 9:          02:42:37       Correct. So many floods in, been in there. I know that there are going their county and, and I last read something to the effect of 40 somewhere.

Speaker 3:          02:42:46       Yeah. That's based on the work of richard weight goes back to the, to the early eighties and I think he's got.

Speaker 9:          02:42:52       No, no, go, go to, go to his graph and we go to his graph. Who graph? Which graph is this mark? It's the one right below the map. Yeah, this one.

Speaker 9:          02:43:04       It's the dating floods. Here we go. We're, we're at that right now. I think I, hopefully, hopefully we're disagreeing in, uh, as comrades here. I'm just trying to give you some data here. Look at those. Uh, those missoula floods, a lake, lake missoula. He's gone dated. You're seeing the dates. He's got standard deviations. One and two standard deviations on, on, on, on the median there. Uh, so we've got these, these things pinned by multiple carbon dates. The little bell curves there. Show how many carbon dates he's got and you can see that these are documented very, very well. So I don't understand why you're, you're, you're so opposed to multiple floods. In fact, I've heard in the last time you guys were on this show, I heard you say that you thought there were multiple floods. Now you're trying to argue against that idea.

Speaker 3:          02:44:03       I, I still, I still think there were multiple floods. I think we have to look at two distinct regimes of floods though, and, and, and as far as the radio carbon dating, the thing we have to be really careful of is that floods will entrain older sediment and in that older sediment there could be radiocarbon dated material that doesn't really date that that time of the flood, but was excavated by the flood in, trained into flood waters and then redeposited. So that's a major problem with radiocarbon dating anytime you're looking at flood sediments. And I do believe there were multiple floods. That's, you know, I think it's a misinterpretation. I think that I only think that there was one flood, but there, the problem is here and I do, I think we're colleagues and my approach to this as just like, you know, in the ama ama, when two guys get out there and try to beat the crap out of each other, and then at the end of it they gave each other a hug. That's kind of where I'm coming from. So, you know, there's nothing

Speaker 9:          02:44:59       personal, each other a hug, but I feel the same way. and by the way, you guyS are very bright and, and

Speaker 3:          02:45:06       very knowledgeable. Well, you know, I, I, I, I really value this because I'm looking for. I'm looking for holes in this idea very much so and, and I have done some serious thinking about this over many years and I have interviewed most of the geologists that have worked on it. I've been in half a dozen field trips guided by the, the, the main geologists that have worked on this and had a chance to dialogue with them and, and you know, I'm convinced that, you know, there's still some, there's a lot to be learned about this and, and I think we need to be looking at, like you said, the big picture and we could get back to a discussion of the finger lakes and how they formed. I think that's important. I think we could get back to a discussion about drum lens and how they formed. You know there is studies on the valley heads, maureen at are at the south end of the finger lakes that have, I can't think of who did it right now. I could pull it up but basically said there it's water deposited, but, but there's a lot of unresolved issues about what happened during this transition,

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       planetary transition out of the last ice age and I think it's important that we have these discussions that we have these dialogues and we try to get to the bottom of what actually happened without imposing too many preconceptions upon our models because I think we're looking at something very unprecedented here.

Speaker 9:          02:46:27       Randall, I couldn't have said that better. It was very well articulated. Let me go back to the big picture. If I could just for a minute, because I want to address something that graham said earlier and that is the gram seems to have this idea that, that comments break up all the time, but, but people didn't understand. Um, I, I think comets and meteorites understand that the, the, the comment schumer levy or whatever it was that broke up, it broke up because of the gravitation of jupiter. We would not expect these comments to break up andrea and into the atmosphere is one of the problems that the common people have had. A firestone once suggested a four kilometer wide comets striking the. Now they've broken it up into multiple comments. The problem is you can't get it separated if a comment breaks up, it's very hard to separate it so that it hits in multiple places.

Speaker 9:          02:47:30       And so, so this is a big picture kind of problem that the common people are having with the scientists. So you may be able to get it to hit, uh, the north american ice sheet. But I'm telling you that the studies are showing that you're not going to be able to do this without leaving some marks. And so far nobody's been able to find a credit. Do you know that, that they're suggesting that a four kilometer comment, if it couldn't break up, it would generate 1 million a crater. Meteor craters. You know how big that was? That was 49,000 years ago. We, we don't see that in the, in the climate record. Forty 9,000 years ago, we should see we don't see it. It's a barely a little thing that they have a huge comet strike. Malcolm malcolm has been standing by for best part of three hours. I

Speaker 1:          02:48:24       since he's a member of the common research group. Wouldn't it be a good time to bring it up? Yeah, we can bring them on as long as mark has satisfied that he said his piece, but unfortunately mark, we can have two people on the phone at the same time.

Speaker 9:          02:48:36       Okay. Do you. I really appreciate you having me on.

Speaker 1:          02:48:39       I appreciate you coming on to and I'm glad you guys especially you in randal seem to have ironed out a lot of your ideas. I think there was a great guy. There's a lot to be learned here obviously, and there's a lot that already has been learned and this is an unbelievably fascinating subject and I think oftentimes when these debates get heated, a lot gets lost and who's wrong or who's right, but I think what we can all agree on is that what we're dealing with is an unbelievable point in and the history

Speaker 6:          02:49:08       of this planet and trying to figure out what caused it and why is some really fascinating stuff. So mark, I really appreciate your time and really appreciate you, uh, you imparting your knowledge on us, if at all possible. I would love to kind of keep some of this dialogue going because I really would value your input and trying to write you randall, um, and I couldn't get through. I'm not sure why I'm not either because if I were to see that, I definitely would've responded. So please send me. I'd love to. I will definitely connect you guys after this is over and thank you once again, mark. Really, really appreciate you calling them. If I can just say I do hope you'll revisit your article and just have a look at the context in which you presented me. They're absolutely. thank you, mark. okay, now we're going to call her number two.

Speaker 6:          02:49:59       This is a fascinating podcast stuff. And your friend who is waiting is malcolm mccomb. Mark, one of the common research group scientists. This is a large and diverse body of scientists who come at it, the material with different expertise in different areas of knowledge. Uh, it happenS that malcolm is a co author of the recent diary regarded highly significant paper finding a platinum anomaly across north America and I would hope you might begin with addressing why that might indicate a comet impact. Right. Is malcolm on you? Shouldn't be malcolm. Can you hear us? I can hear your. Excellent. How are you, malcolm? Thank you very much for joining us. Have been here. Uh, so give us your thoughts on what graeme just said, if you would, as to why, uh, why it makes sense that it was a comment that hit and why there would be these large deposits of these. What was it exactly in that time in the recent paper, but, but malcolm is also an expert in magnetic microsphere yules and I think he can address that issue as well. The whole range of proxies of impact proxies and malcolm, please just give us your thoughts on this entire phenomenon, if you will. I will.

Speaker 6:          02:51:22       Happy to be here. Happy to have you.

Speaker 6:          02:51:28       Is he breaking up? No, go ahead. Go ahead. Malcolm. I think there's an issue. Seems to be. Can you go. I know what's going on. I've got a feedback. I forgot to turn off this. Okay. Oh yeah. You got to meet that other video. Oh, okay. Okay. You were listening to us at the same time as talking to us here. You're going to get. You're, you're getting us on like a 42nd delay or something? Yeah. Okay. We call them out. Actually, I was very interested to hear mark's, uh, his initial statement kind of put me off, but his, uh, his subsequent statements I thought were, were, were pretty accurate and there is, there are

Speaker 10:         02:52:05       many problems with the, uh, the hypothesis that there was an impact and that's the way I consider it. I don't really think in terms of a common impact, I think in terms of an extraterrestrial impact because I don't think we've proven a cognitive pack. I don't think we've proven. We don't think we know what kind of an impacted was. There's too many questions that have to be answered. Uh, so I can't sign up to say that I'm defending the comet impact hypothesis because I don't frankly know what it was. A, we have a lot of evidence that appears to be extra terrestrial in nature. We have magnetic, micro sterols. Um, I can give you the most frequent criticism we get is that the, the evidence has not been replicated. And that's where I thought mark was going when he, his initial statement was that the comment impact hypothesis has been debunked.

Speaker 10:         02:52:56       And I think what he meant was if I can speak for him, um, was that the fact that it was a comment has been debunked. I don't think that's necessarily true yet. It just isn't indicated that, uh, that it was a comment. It's we have indications that it was more of an asteroid hit than anything else. And I can conceive of a rubble pile that somehow became a, this associated all of there be, there have to be a mechanism or a model for that. And I don't think we have a model for that. Um, asteroids come in many flavors and a rubble piles or certainly one loose loose aggregate, some material that could become separated possibly. But, uh, I just don't know. I just don't know at this stage. Um, I guess the biggest criticism that we faced in terms of the impact hypothesis is that the evidence has not been replicable and we now have, I guess for three or four, uh, evidence lines that had been replicated By numerous independent groups.

Speaker 10:         02:54:05       Google's the nano diamonds, whiCh may be the most controversial of a bunch of the evidence lines that's been, that's been replicated by four different groups, independent, uh, five different studies. The magnetIc microspheres which were initially treated very hostile late because they didn't understand what we were talking about. And some of that was a self inflicted wound on a part of the initial study, uh, which didn't show. We were really refining and uh, that's been corrected. And there's the same objection or criticism is being made. Magnetic microsphere roles are typically very well. They're melted and then their quenched, uh, they, they said that they're subjected to high temperatures and then those temperatures are, are rapidly reduced, which is sort of accepted to be characteristics of an impact. So we've got that evidence of an impact and that's been replicated by 10 different independent groups and including many of the same sites that were originally disputed.

Speaker 10:         02:55:10       So then the, the disputation has been largely based upon the failure to do the most basic part of the protocol, which is to, uh, to do the scanning electron microscopic analysis of the spheros. Okay. that, that is the microsphere, the, and the nano diamonds. The other is the discovery of platinum iridium osmium, which are the platinum group elements which are characteristic of an asteroid impact. And we found some evidence of, of, uh, of iridium, not, not a lot, but there had been certain sites that are rich and iridium at the. And once again, this is at the younger dryas boundary, not above, not below. It's there at that boundary so that they seem to be pretty solid. And iridium is indicative of an impact of extraterrestrial origin, correct? That's correct. The platinum is simply just another more, more plentiful, a platinum group elements, obviously that's why they're called the platinum groups. Uh, osmium is one that is usually associated with iridium. There are now 11 studies by independent groups that have confirmed the, uh, the occurrence of platinum osmium we're already in, so it looks to me like the evidence is piling up on the most recent one, of course is to platinum study by more. That just came out a few months ago now. Random girls.

Speaker 8:          02:56:36       I'm sorry to interrupt you, but randall carlson just had us pull up some images that we're looking at. RAndall, please explain what this is. Well, this is from malcolm's 2012 independent evaluation of conflicting microsphere real results from different investigations. This is his supplementary information figure for. So it's just so that the people watching this can, can actually see what you're talking about when you're discussing the rapid quenching effect on the surface of the microsphere oils. So we've got up on the screen here, supplementary information, figure four where you've got the microspheres from topher, blackwater draw and papaw cove. So just, just so people can see what that surface texture looks like. Like

Speaker 10:         02:57:22       a. Yeah, you see these, they looked like leaf, like structures across. Some of them are harder to see, but they're there. If you see the original image, it's large enough and clear enough to actually see these, what we call dendritic structures or, or a almost like a carpet. We've, those are essentially truncated crystallization. It's a, it's a crystallization process that's clenched. I'm not a geologist, had geologists try to explain it to me and uh, that's what I'm trying to do here. But uh, yeah, the, uh, the fact that these are enhanced, these, these things are quite enhanced at the average rise and really depleted above and below. Now there are spheros throughout the column, one column of, of soil. When you go down vertically a deeper, you find spheros. Those spheros are typically what we call orthogenic, which means that are created by terrestrial processes. You need to do a scanning electron microscope and x ray, a dispersive spectroscopy to differentiate those from the, uh, the terrestrial processes that are producing these things.

Speaker 8:          02:58:37       Yeah. Your figure five has a frand boydell sphero, which is probably what you're talking about. If you could go to slide 13, jamie, and, and you'll be able to see. Yeah, there it is. You can see very distinct difference. So we've got your figure five up on the screen now, malcolm,

Speaker 10:         02:58:54       the when, when you look at optical microscope, they look just like the are very much like the, uh, the, what we call impacts fuels are magnetic microsphere rules and they occur much more frequently. I mean, I've got, I've got sites that have tens of thoUsands of these things in every couple of centimeters of sediment. So you've got to separate the, uh, this, the, the, the impact spheros and the magnetic microsphere oils from these things. But what you appear to be saying about them is that there is an abundance of impact proxy evidence, which in your opinion adds up to a cosmic impact of some sort, not necessarily a comment you're suggesting an asteroid. It's a mysterious event in that sense. But what it adds up to is an impact in your view. Is that a fair, a fair? These, what we call proxies, the, the impacts spherules the, a platinum group elements, the, uh, the melt glass, which I haven't discussed yet.

Speaker 10:         02:59:50       And the nano diamonds are enhanced and the enhancement has been replicated on numerous occasions for each of these, these proxies. So anyone who says that the work of you and your team has been completely debunked is, is clearly not completely familiar with the literature that that's, that would seem to be the case that are, we're a disingenuous in that regard. So I would say that that, uh, because typically what we see is that the, the opposition literature does not cite the studies that have come out. Yeah. We try and cite both the critical studies and ours and give reasons why our studies supplant. There's habit I wish they would share. But, uh, could you go into hasn't been the case

Speaker 8:          03:00:37       slide 82. It would be nice if we could have had you on with mark so you guys can exchange information. But unfortunately our capabilities that we can only take one phone call at a time, we will definitely try to update that for the new studio. Although we never anticipated this was going to happen in the first place. But uh, are awesome. Oh, there we go. Up on the screen. Malcolm, we've got from ted bunch at our 2012 very high temperature impact melt products as evidence for cosmic airburst sandy impacts 12,000, 900 years ago. Uh, so we have figure a supplementary information, six, the light photo micrographs of magnetic and glassy spherules from melrose, Pennsylvania, and it shows the, the wide variety of shapes, which includes spheros ovals, teardrops in dumbbells. And I think so you can see pretty distinctly what you're talking about here with the, with the glassy spheros.

Speaker 8:          03:01:32       And then like particularly, I don't, I'm not sure if you were co author of this paper or not. You were not. Okay. Are you familiar with that paper? Do you know? The good. Okay. Yeah, I chose some very interesting, you know, teardrop shapes, dumbbell shapes and where you can actually see that like dumbbell h up there consists of two dissimilar accretionary spheros, one clear silicon rich and the other opaque iron rich that have been fused together. And that's, that's pretty convincing evidence of the, of the energy that's involved in these phenomena that you actually have these fused spheros like this. And then jamie, if you go down to the next image, which is a scanning electron microscope images comparing younger dryas boundary spirits on the top row with known impacts virals on the bottom row. This is a very interesting comparison because you've probably seen this when malcolm a.

Speaker 8:          03:02:28       There's, there's three across the top three across the bottom and a is actually a from knutson's or knudsen farm and candidates, a young cretaceous tertiary boundary, sphero and just below it is a younger dryas spiro from lakewood, ceo in Mexico, and one can see the morphological similarity of the two quite clearly. Then c and d compares a c is a spiritual from the tunguska air burst, and then d is younger dryas boundary from lindzen, Germany, which dates to 12,800 years before present. And here you can see very clearly the, the, the, the rapid quench melt, a texture on the surface between the two comparison, comparing togusa airburst with a younger dryas boundary object. And then finally enf, we have an iron calcium silico sphero from meteor crater compared with an iron calcium silica younger dryas boundary sphero from abou herea, Syria. And again, in each of these cases you can see the similarities between the different types of objects. So you have these three objects which are come from that younger dryas boundary layer, all which have morphological similarity to known impact proxies. And this is very difficult to dismiss this as being mere coincidence. Yeah, I would agree. And uh, those, those are very, especially the ac bed

Speaker 10:         03:03:58       pictures are very similar to the material that I'm taking out of the younger dryas boundary of the sites that I've been looking at.

Speaker 7:          03:04:04       Malcolm, what evidence, if any, are you aware of about what is that nuclear glass material called trying try to the trinity. That's how you say it. What I, I, from what I understand, there's quite a bit of that that also appears in the same time period. And the core samples,

Speaker 10:         03:04:23       there are some instances of it, but I wouldn't say quite a bit. Some of these are very site specific and one of the, one of the things I've been trying to do is work my way closer and closer to Canada to see if there's any truth to the, to this whole idea that the primary impact site was Canada. So I've been trying to look at sites closer and closer and I've seen sites in New Jersey, this would be eastern Canada. I've seen sites in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania that produce a, what appears to be some form of trinet tight or, or melt glass or what a ted bunch a would call scoria like objects. And it seems to, to, uh, to bear out that, that, uh, at least that far, uh, we're getting richer material out of the sediment out of the younger dryas boundary settlement. Is this trinity

Speaker 7:          03:05:13       tights material only produced in this manner? It's also produced their nuclear explosion test. Right? But other than that, is this the only way that it's produced on earth?

Speaker 10:         03:05:24       Well, an impact would do it. A or a full garage could delay. What is the right is, is what's produced by a pipe like a lightening strike can produce a, a spherules that could produce all the high temperature products that you see an impact, um, but in a very limited way, you wouldn't expect to see it in a, in a layer less than was some sort of global lightening storm. Um, the, uh, what I was going to say about the, uh, the melt glass is that in the material we're looking at, you see evidence of, of melted, a zircons, melted chrome, all of which are very high temperature, uh, features high, indicating a very high temperature that was experienced by that particular object. Or are you seeing the image we have up here? Yes, I agree. Okay, good.

Speaker 11:         03:06:16       Okay.

Speaker 7:          03:06:17       Yeah, there are a is for meteor crater and b is from the trinity nuclear test. So, and then, uh, with the 22 kiloton yield and nancy is from one of the soviet era nuclear tests. And d is again, a scoria like object from apo hurriya. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         03:06:33       So yeah. So, and then if we go to, uh, let's see, um, you gotta love that. It says stalin, I, yeah, jamie. Maria, like objects, the, uh, the milk glass screen. I like objects has only been found in about half a dozen sites at this point. So we're still, you know, and I think it's a matter of how close you are to an impact point and you're very far apart. That would lend credence to the idea of multiple impacts if they seem to be getting more and more plentiful as you get further and further north and maybe there's more moral legitimacy to a, to a primary impact site. Right now. We just don't know. You know, we're still, we're still working that out.

Speaker 8:          03:07:16       All right. We got another nice slide from, from the bunch article here. the slide. Yeah. Calcium oxide rich scoria like object created by the melting of carbonate and silica rich precursor rocks, the yellow areas, the calcium oxide, the white areas, le chateau earlier, right. And dark areas are iron oxide. So that's a really nice. Legit. Yeah. I had been struggling With getting that down. um, and then jamie, if you go to the next one, we will see there is a scoria like object for a meteor crater, Arizona and you could toggle back and forth between the two so that people can kind of see the similarity between them.

Speaker 10:         03:07:58       And I see a lot in the sites that produce milk glass. that's what I'm seeing. Yeah. those two, those two types of a particular 10, how much of this material are you finding in these sites? Well, you don't plan, I have to say you don't find a lot of this material. It takes, it's a struggle to get it, but what you don't find is anything above or below it, that particular layer, uh, unless you know that there's been a very dynamic environment which case it can be spread out, uh, in the, in the soil column. And what's the implication of nothing above it and below it. Well that, that, uh, you've got a specific date for a specific date for it. And, uh, the layer that we, we typically try and just live at our investigation to layers that have been dated to the younger dryas boundary or contained her dryas boundary layer.

Speaker 10:         03:08:44       Right? But lIke I say, if you have a very dynamic environment, it can really screw things up. Um, you can be very difficult to interpret. So this has been a lot of flooding, repetitive flooding, difficult science to do. So again, this is difficult science to do. Uh, yeah. And, and, uh, I should add there that proving an impact is not easy. It takes a while and, and it just is proving an impact crater is not easy, as I'm sure mark would agree that you'd find a crater. There's no guarantee that's either an impact impact a event or a or a volcanic had been until you do the research and spend the time to investigate it. But if you could summarize for us what's your opinion now on the balance of the evidence? Always bearing in mind that you may change that opinion as more evidence comes in. Yeah, I would say we were facing an unprecedented type of event here that appears to have been a, something approaching global. I mean we've got evidence now in south America. We've got evidence, uh, and a lot of this stuff is unpublished. I mean, I, there's a lot of things that I could bring up that aren't published, so that is kind of useless to refer to them because there's no way of checking what I'm saying, but we're seeing stuff that goes very far into south America

Speaker 10:         03:10:00       and we're seeing things in Syria. We haven't looked elsewhere. We've seen about the pacIfic ocean, we've seen it in europe. So I mean where does it end? And it's all. We haven't found it yet. And it's all at the younger dryas boundary. That's correct, yeah. What have you found in the pacific ocean? A while sharma has found. So it was a paper I can cite from this is a need, just a presentation a quarter. He says, we infer that the central pacific was a sign of deposition of osmium resulting from dusk, from dust cloud falling immediate impacted 12, $12,000. Animals plus or minus $4,000, so right in that, right in that ballpark, sharma says that, uh, he found osmium and I believe he's, he's come up with microsphere met at same core, but uh, so the central pacific is an idea that gives you an idea of how extensive this, this thing was. Now malcolm, this is obviously some controversial material. It's a, it's, it's fairly new in terms of the public consciousness. Have you had anybody debate you on this or have you had anybody oppose you? Yeah, it goes with, it goes with the territory. I wish the, uh, the oppositions in some respects in some cases. I wish the opposition was a bit higher caliber then. And what I've seen, I think it's, uh, it's been a sad state at a. The most virulent opposition has not. I have, I haven't regarded as particularly I, I quality

Speaker 5:          03:11:34       malcolm. Michael shermer here, just, uh, do you have an opinion on, uh, the, the association of thE impact with the megafauna extinction. And also then grams hypothesis about the extinction of this lost civilization.

Speaker 10:         03:11:51       The, uh, I really comment on the lost civilization aspects of this. I have a hard enough time dealing with the media, right impact, uh, as far as the megafauna goes, I think that, uh, I guess I would say all of the above. I think that all these factors came into play. You've got a humans who are, you know, for that period of technologically advanced with, with, uh, the clovis point and the, uh, the atlatl in the spear, um, the uh, replaceable spirit tip that must have been devastating to the foreigner, but the, the idea of attacking a, a, a proper sending to me is almost unthinkable. I mean, those things are today. If you don't have a high powered rifle, I just don't see how you, you realistically go up against the bull elephant. I mean, it just strikes me as far too dangerous a gone.

Speaker 10:         03:12:45       But, uh, there are aspects of that question that I think are going to be very, very interestingly the next, the next couple of years or so, we have a book coming out that addresses that directly. One of thE sites I've been researching that, uh, the whole extinction of the megafauna may have been as much related to religion is something else. There may have been a relIgion built around the extinction of the megafauna. Um, how, so that's well that you'd want the evidence for that and that, that evidence will be coming out in a book and that's going to be published in about a month or two.

Speaker 1:          03:13:19       Oh, I could speak to the whole idea of hunting bull elephants, though unfortunately, people have been hunting with bows and arrows forever. Uh, it's not an adult battle. Atlatl is less effective. You get less range, but people hunt with not just modern compound bows, which are very powerful. The w, which would allow you to shoot it from 100 yards away. But with long bows, they've been hunting elephants with bows and arrows for a long time. You know, especially the thing with wooly mammoths was that they would go after the females, apparently according to dan flores who wrote american serengeti and that the females would keep the young in their body. Their gestation period was very long. Like, I believe you said it was two years, is that correct? I think you said it was two years and so it made them extremely vulnerable when they were pregnant. Obviously if you kill off thE females that are pregnant, you're killing off a substantial part of the breeding population and the population suffers tremendously. So that was one. But it also could have been that and you know, that humans I'm sure had an impact on virtually anything that we could eat when we were starving. But whether or not we wiped them out, the blitzkrieg hypothesis, there's a lot of holes in that theory. According to, uh, a lot of people that have studied at.

Speaker 10:         03:14:33       Well I think, you know, if you have an environmental impact or a degradation of the environment that might follow a significant impact, an extraterrestrial impact, so you're, you're reducing the population was stressing the population of megafauna that way. And then you've got a population of hunters in addition to that. And especially if they're for some reason or other focused on hunting a sent ends. And when the, when the number gets limited, they don't care whether it's a female or a male and they go africa wherever they can get, then I think the population of megaphones gonna suffer. So I think it's a combination of factors, not necessarily just one.

Speaker 1:          03:15:10       Yeah, I think that's very reasonable. Malcolm, is there anything else that you would like to add before we let you go?

Speaker 10:         03:15:17       Uh, no, I, I, I guess one thing is the interest. I found it interesting in the discussion of, uh, the uh, the scab lands and, and uh, that was really, it was looking at the scab lands from, from flying over them when I was a young naval officer that, uh, got me interested in science and why I pursued science. It was looking at that, the catastrophes that were etched in the landscape there, uh, the catastrophic floods that really caused me to pursue a career in science. It's really a remarkable.

Speaker 8:          03:15:50       It just a personal observation.

Speaker 1:          03:15:52       Well, we're very, very thankful for your time and we really, really appreciate your input here and it means a lot. And, and thank you for everything you've done. Thank you for everything that you continue to do to highlight this. It is such a fascinating subject and it's so amazing and without someone like you presenting hard data in science, it would definitely be lost. So thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, malcolm. Yeah, thank you malcolm. All right, malcolm, we're going to let you go. Okay. Take it easy buddy. Sat down. Time for your nap. Malcolm. It's a lot of energy. So these podcasts are long. I mean four hours. The guy was sitting there on standby. Probably, you know, chomping at the bit. I'm jamie. Before we go, I want to see some pictures of the scab lands because that is pretty amazing stuff.

Speaker 1:          03:16:40       And randall, one more thing before we go. One thing that you pointed out to me during one of the episodes that was so stunning was these woolly mammoths that had been literally knocked over by an impact with broken legs and that died on the spot. Do you have those images? I do it. That was actually a mastodon mastodon. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. I want to see those. So let's go to the scab. Lands first so we can show the audience on youtube, which is by the way, only about 10 percent of the people that watch this, so if you're listening to this, go check out the a scab lands on a on google and you could see this. Describe it to us, randall. Well here where this is

Speaker 8:          03:17:24       textbook, scab land right here. Let's see what this is. Probably rock lake or sprague lake into cheney. Paloose. Scab lands. Yeah, you see the potholes there. That's a sign of turbulence. Extreme turbulence within the water. Coking is is what the process is called, where you get it's so turbulent than it actually produces vortexes. High intensity vortex motion in the water. It'll pick up sediment and it can drill its way right into the, into the bedrock I'm going down there. That's palouse falls, which was say that's an under foot waterfall because what you have to realize is that at the peak of the flooding, this entire scene was submerged below water and the cataract here is an extinct feature and the flow over here was thousands of times greater than the present palouse river that you see right there. We've got a lot of great pictures up unto geo cosmic rex website and some awesome video clips. I'm just curious, are these geo cosmic rex? Rex. Rex. Okay. And you were saying wreck like a car wreck. Well that's, it's a play on words. Um, so yeah, we are talking about that, but yeah, we got some great footage on

Speaker 7:          03:18:48       there. I did. We show that last time. I believe we did the light of deadly. Showed a bit of a chemist. Prairie ripples. Did we show potholes cataract? Yeah. This whole scab land thing is his literally fascinated me since 1978 and like malcolm and I think that summer of 1970 traveling out in some of these landscapes. Where you. Yeah, here we go. Is the drone footage. Wow.

Speaker 8:          03:19:22       Yeah. And let's see, be ready to pause you if we need to hear. Is this the beginning? Because at the beginning we have a google earth image. She can get a sense of what we're looking at here. Go, go back to the beginning, right at the very beginning. Let's see if it starts off with. Oh, it starts off with the drone. Okay. There should be another one that actually. That's okay. This is pretty cool. Yeah. This is. This is. These are 400 foot cliffs. This was a bomb recessional cataract. Very similar to dry falls. The water was pouring. Coming from behind our view here. Where's this specifically? If anybody wanted to go watch this or look at this area. Oh, the actual area. This is an eastern Washington eastern rim of quinty base and it's called. It's right along. Just if you can see up there were those cliffs are in the middle distance, right below there is the columbia river. And this is just north of wenatchee, Wisconsin, Wisconsin, Washington. So basically what we had here was plucking a quarrying as the water poured over this ridge. This is the babcock ridge and behind us as the quincy basin, which served as a temporary holding pond. And let's see, is the, is the drone comes around? I'm looking for the um, for the team. Oh, keep going to zoom in a little bit more there. Jamie. she can see you guys down there on the ground, right? Yeah. Were they in there somewhere? Lost in the vastness of the.

Speaker 7:          03:20:59       Yeah. Now I remember we did show this. Yeah. What about those images of the mastodons? Let's look at tHose and then let's get outta here. Okay. For that, you have to go to the world of the pleistocene, which I just should have given you. That sounds like a amusement park. Yeah. The world of the place is, be some dudes with animal skins on them. Well, maybe if they stayed in, you know, cloning some of those frozen animals up there. Yeah. I don't know how plausible it is, but that seems like a terrible idea. The last world, nothing is any diseases. Well that's one of the big concerns about climate change, right? They we're going to release some diseases that we don't have an immune system for. Yep. Go to slide

Speaker 8:          03:21:46       78.

Speaker 8:          03:21:49       This is a good example of, by the way, who is more thoroughly documented than randall carlson and jesus christ. Man, go to slide 6,220 to 50 plus years of walking the walk in the channels kavalans. Uh, yeah. This, this is a bone deposit. Um, and what happens is that in a particularly warm years, when the, um, the permafrost around thE rivers collapses, it exposes these huge deposits of bones which had been buried in the permafrost. This is, when I look at stuff like this, this is why I say there had to be another mechanisms of extinction besides human hunting because this pile, yeah, because it possible that this, I mean, it's not necessarily at the bottom of a cliff, right? Because you know that they pushed a lot of them off cliffs and know this. THis is stuff that when the river floods, it erodes the banks and then this stuff falls out of the riverbanks.

Speaker 8:          03:22:45       So it's, it's been locked into the permafrost for however many thousands of years and it seems like there's interestingly two peaks of dates that one right around 13,000 and the other one around $36,000 that, that the, that the, that the fossilized remains are dating too, which could point to a potentially that there was some sort of an impact back then as well or something else, some sort of event. I, I don'T know. I don't have an opinion on now by having all these together. I mean has it been theorize that perhaps this was at the. This is not all your cliff near this, right? Yeah. Just off the, to the right, to their interest. There is a cliff where at the bottom of a cliff right here. That is actually, it's a riverbank. So, so just off, you know that that was a hunting method. They used to storm them off the side of cliffs and they never, they literally couldn't even eat all of them like head smashed in buffalo heads smashed.

Speaker 8:          03:23:35       They would do, they would run so many them off cliffs that. But here's the thing, here's the thing, when you look at at, at the more these mortality events of modern animals, even like looking at elephants that perished during some of the severe droughts in the eighties in africa, taxonomic studies show that it doesn't take three, four, five years before the remains have completely disappeared. In order to preserve a fossil, it has to be rapidly removed from any kind of forces, oxidation or scavenger or anything that would consume it. See, this stuff has been, again, it's been frozen in the permafrost for, for however many years, 10 or 12 or 15,000 years. So it was likely covered in an event. Covered in an event. Yes. Now what? There was one that I really wanteD you to get to that was a mastodon that had been literally knocked over and had broken legs. Yeah. That would be.

Speaker 8:          03:24:32       We could look very quickly at slide 92. This is one of the more interesting anomalous events. This was the, um, the flash woolly mammoth. Go to the, go to slide 93. It's a much clearer. Yeah. This was a mammoth. SIx ton mammoth. That was again, one of these river collapses. the banks collapsed during a warm spring and expose this remains of a woolly mammoth with soft tissue preserved, uh, contents of the food in its stomach on digested actually a mouthful of food. The hips of the mammoth where we're both broken as if he was thrown back on his haunches very violently. He had an erect penis, which suggests to us that he was suffocated, which he was a freak where he was freaked out. He was getting. Michael laughed at that. That's the wolves ate the flesh off the skull. That's why it's buried like that. You'll see the front left for liam there. You'll see the bottom there left right at the center of the screen. That's his back leg. Oh wow. Did you see right there? The interesting thing about this is you know, the, the, the rapidity of climate change that's implied by being able to freeze a six ton mammoth because the contents of his stomach, according to the studies had not really been purified yet, which implies that the entire carcass had been frozen through and through probably in less than 10 hours.

Speaker 5:          03:26:05       Well, like it see the ice man, that's, that's what happened to him.

Speaker 8:          03:26:08       That's exactly what happened to him. Yes. Interesting point. In abu dhabi, a subject that we should talk about, it fell in between a crevice in a glacier, correct? Yeah, and probably got rapidly buried under the under the snow and the ice and that's how he ended up overnight preserved. Yeah, overnIght. Exactly. The next slide actually shows her reconstruction of the, of the in, in a, in a museum in Russia, showing what the mammoth, the circumstances under which he was found. If you go to

Speaker 5:          03:26:40       as a sidebar on annuity ad to show you how science changes rather slowly. Sometimes it was a decade before they found out he was murdered because they found arrow point in his scapula. Here they can cut is about annie had a defensive wounds on his hands and arms, so he'd gotten into a fight and he had other people's blood on his hands, so he gave as good as he got and lost a fight. So he was murdered. Wow. And that, that took it with all that careful observation and laboratories that 10 years before that came out. Sometimes this stuff has to just take a while. So if I can try to find some common ground with before we sign off with graeme, um, you know, you're uh, you know, your book is, you have this really great sentence that I quote this, it would mean at least that some yet unknown and identify people somewhere in the world had already mastered all the arts and attributes of a high civilization more than 12,000 years ago and sent out emissaries around the world. Okay. I think this is entirely possible cognitively for sure. And

Speaker 7:          03:27:42       it Will do it for me. What the boats that they sent the emissaries out on the wood, carbon 14 dated in some specific examples of high arts and attributes of high civilization. So if it's not metal and writing, then you know, whatever it is, I would change my mind.

Speaker 4:          03:28:00       That's good to hear michael. And I think as the, as the research continues in this area for the last few years, having been very much an outsider, I have felt that the evidence is moving in a direction that is helpful to the argument that I make. I hope it'll continue to be that way. I hope the evidence that you're looking for will, will, will come out. And I'm trying to, like I say my, my, my role is a reporter and I'm trying to be a reporter for the alternative sides of things. But to do so to do so in an effective. And hopefully

Speaker 7:          03:28:34       there's a good argument in the history of science to be made for the role of outsiders and mean complete outsiders to come in and shake things up. I mean freeman dyson as an example, you know? Yeah, totally. Self taught autodidact. I called you an autodidact. Absolutely. And they can make. And if nothing else, they push people to really figure out what it is they believe in. Why? Because otherwise no one's going to challenge them. So in births is a good example of that. You know, a high school teacher, right? However, randall carlson is good example.

Speaker 7:          03:29:06       Well, let's see. You still want to look at this real quick. The mastodon I got right here. Let's do it. He could go for days about randall. He never gets tired of this stuff. If you could bottle your enthusiasm will be an awesome pill. Well, maybe we can talk about the memory. Focus there all. Alright, we're gonna. We're gonna. Look at this. This mastered on here. One 25. One 25. Yeah. So this is a mastodon that was dug up in a pit years ago. Um, excavation showed that the bones were lying on an inner layer of limey clay or marble, about one foot and thickness, um, when the, when it gets up there and it goes on to say the skeleton proved to be badly disturbed and the bones crushed and broken. As an example of the amount of disturbance, one of the ribs lay beneath one of the tusks.

Speaker 7:          03:29:56       While another was thrust through an aperture in the pelvis, a shoulder blade rested to the right of the skull and one of the large neck vertebrae was found about 10 feet from the skull near a portion of the pelvis in spite of the wide dislocation of the parts the. Now this is where it really is interesting. The bones of one of the feet remained intact and in place very possibly in the spot where the animal last step. So in other words, the foot, there was a foot still embedded in the soft material where he was apparently stepping at the time, whatever happened to them. Um, and this is all the same time period as the other mastodon. We don't have data on this, but it, it likely was at the very end, probably right in that younger dryas window because of the amount of sediment over it goes to the next slide, jamie.

Speaker 7:          03:30:44       And we'll see 1:26. We can get a better than this thing theoretically, at least was blown back. Yeah, go to. There we go there you can see one of the femurs that's been busted squarely across. Um, they go on to say that even the largest of the bone such as the thigh bones were broken squarely across in places indicating that some considerable force had been exerted upon them. Any conclusion as to an agency powerful enough to cause such destruction must be highly speculative. So basically what you're seeing here is a mastodon that got smashed into the ground. Wow. The forest is, there were strong, powerful sheer forces that would have literally separated his leg from the foot. It still in immersed into the, into the ground. So I mean, there are many examples of this. The last slide we're going to show, if you go back this, I promise to digging with jack horner, that paleontologists, that dinosaur digger and he, he showed these debris flow pileups of dinosaur bones that had been splintered and broken. Wow. And these are huge just from the force of the water and then piling up at the edge of a wall and sl if you can do it to a dinosaur. Wow. Eighty 85 85 is an interesting slide because what it shows is the london ivory docs, which over a period of about two centuries, this was. This was a mammoth ivory that's being dug out of the siberian permafrost. That's just a drawing. Oh, that's just a drawing.

Speaker 7:          03:32:29       That's the problem with that. Like that's what it looked like. A 19th century scene showing the ivory floor of the london docks covered by thousands of mammoth tusks and this went on year after year after year after year for roughly two centuries. There is so much of that mammoth ivory, by the way that they use it to make knife handles. I actually have a knife handle that I. Yeah, that was made out of mammoth ivory and still to this day, not only is it legal, but it's common to use mammoth ivory for different kinds of things and there's so much of it. Well, they're not endangered species because there was kind of a loophole in this case though. What we have is tucks that are being again dug out of the permafrost. So how did they get there? That becomes the questIon, does it have anything to do with human predation or was it a natural catastrophe that somehow ended up putting all these mammas down and burying them into permafrost?

Speaker 7:          03:33:25       That's the question I want to raise. Well, I think we raised a lot of questions. I think we got some pretty good answers. I think We had some great dialogue and I really appreciate your time. All three of you guys and thank you to malcolm and thank you mark and thank you to young jamie. Oh, thanks for hosting. My pleasure. Treat. can I do a quick shout out out? I want to thank brad young, cameron, wiltshire, my brother, rowan, my wife julie for helping make this possible. I also want to have people go to the geo cosmic rick's website and the sacred geometry international website for a lot more of this kind of stuff. Then I'm going to thank my beloved partner and wife santha, who's chaired every adventure with me for the last quarter of a century. We climbed the great pyramid together. We'd been at the bottom of the ocean together and I wouldn't be doing any of this stuff if it weren't for that wonderful woman behind me.

Speaker 7:          03:34:16       Michael shermer, who you want to thank. Oh, thank my wife jennifer, my little boy vinny. And uh, my agent, my. No, no, no, but a skeptic.com. And my partner pat, who keeps the show running when I'm running around doing things like this. All right. And joe rogan. Joe. I speak all over the world and whether it's South Africa or whether it's Japan or whether it's britain or whether it's United States or whether it's Croatia. People come up to me and they say, Joe Robinson. Yeah. Well thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate everybody's interesting guests really. Well. You're one of them. Do all you guys are. Thank you so much. All right. We'll see you guys soon. Thank you

Speaker 12:         03:34:55       so long.
