Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Brian, this doesn't have a connection. Did you plug it in?

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. When your wife was

Speaker 1:          00:00:25       Wifi is jacked, people are asking why do you guys have an opening song? And then after the opening song then you play more music. What kind of Shit is that? And you're right. It's fucking ridiculous. So shows you take us. I can't believe anybody's even listening to this point. This is the most ghetto podcast on the internet. The most fun to do though. And this is a Mashup Brian, who's the Mesh out? I believe it's party Ben. It might be girl talk. I don't know. You know what man? I used to not be a big fan of podcasts until I heard this Voodoo child z mix and I was like God damn. Okay. You did something there. You know like a lot of times I'll listen to podcasts and one or to a mashup rather. And I'm like this isn't that interesting. It's kind of that every now and then they didn't fucking make something super cool.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Just kill it. Yeah. It's like, should they shouldn't think would go together like chicken and Waffles, Bam. Yeah. Yeah. You know there is a Jay z Lincoln Park Mashup that was just dirty. Yeah. It didn't feel like a whole album of that. Yeah. I love when Shit like that happens. I love when artists get together like that and create something fucking nutty. We were talking about this before the podcast and it's, you know, total retard, hippy talk. But what the fuck is music and why? What does it do? Why does it just get in man? Because way we're talking to is going to introduce him eventually. This is my friend Chris. What's going on? Chris is a, he's a writer. He writes for the blog. What is it? Warrior. Poet Dot taught us to us then and what is it.us, man. I'm looking to take over the world eventually, but I'm starting with the US. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       dot com is currently unavailable. So yeah, I couldn't get Joe Rogan.com. The dude who owns it as, as he's a nice guy. He's a real estate guy, but he, he goes, just occurred to me to more famous. You get the more. This is worth it. I was like, oh, all right. Derek, come up buying the twitter dude who was holding down your a? Yeah, but I got it back from twitter. Twitter gave it up, but this dude's his name's Joe Rogan and he's older than me. So respect to him. It's got to go to him more than it is to me. Uh, you know, and I was willing to buy it. But when after you said that, it was like, get out of here, the more famous you get, the more initiative worth. Come on, man. What, what are you 12? Just tell me what you want.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       Can we talk through this? More family feel that I can hold onto it. You feel grit and restaurant, except you have to be able to buy it for it to be valuable in some matter. You can find me now. It's Google Joe Rogan.net. If you can't, it's probably good. It probably filters out a bunch of idiots. Yeah. Because if you can't type.net instead of.com, she'd give up that quick. You know, I couldn't find it. I don't want you find the people who put the.com in the google search bar instead of the url to. Yeah, sure. Brian knows about that. I do that all the time. What happens when that, when you do that, you porn shows up in the aftermath using a flashlight. Is that really what happens? Porn shows up if you put a dollar every time I put anything I, I'm on fucking directly.

Speaker 1:          00:03:28       I think. I think that's called a virus or I just need to clear my cache because it seriously, everything that comes up on my toolbar know, just been beaten it furiously lately. Brian, if you don't know, ladies and gentlemen, Brian had a very lust filled short term relationship which filled with passion and the loss of fluids. And then, uh, as, as quickly as the storm came into town, storm left and I have kids. Now I have a kid. Now he's got a kid from the relationship. Just. So here's, here's lesson number one. Children. Anyone under 30 that I'm talking to you right now, listen to me. Do not get a dog with a chick ever. Don't do it unless you guys have kids. Don't get a dog and if you do, do it good. Get nutty. And if you do, do it, go right to the pet store.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       Fuck what they say. Just go against all the rules and getting one of those dogs that will go to the pet. So don't support puppy mills, man. Hope those pet stores go under. Go to the fucking pound or go to a good breeder. I got one of my dogs from a breeder, man, I am not, there's nothing wrong with breeders. People talk shit about breeders, but if the guy's a passionate breeder and really breeds dogs because he wants like a good beat. My dog is awesome dude. And one of the reasons why he's awesome is because his dad was awesome. His Dad was one of the security dogs on fear factor. We had um, like bite people in these big crazy bites, suits and his dad whose dog was so cool. He was just chill, hanging out with everybody. Not Do she do the other dogs, it was just the sweetest dog come over to hey man, what's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       Meanwhile he's this giant, massive and I'm like, what a great dog. Like he's so friendly and such a difference. Genuinely affectionate, like come up and rub against you and love it when you rub his head. Like how crazy is his dogs get like this perfect personality with this guy. Won't let his douchebags breed you. Just anytime he goes, I love them, I take care of them, but no breeding you, you fuck. And he takes and he takes all the Douche bags out. So he's done this for like 20 generations. So his dogs are like the coolest dogs. Like I come over his house, he's got these big fucking massive. So it's like the chicks, like a buck 30 and the males like a buck 50 and they'd come up to me like, okay, these are lions. These are digitally small lions that I'm just assuming you have control over.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       You know, I'm walking in your house and I'm trusting my balls and my legs. I'm trusting all my soft tissue to these monsters that you have under your control. The dogs couldn't have been more chill. Just like, hey, how you doing? Come not, not like checking you out. Like what's up bitch? She put the fuck you doing around here, not sniffing you. All Aggro. Like some of them will disrespect you with a sniff and that's, that's like letting you know pitch. I'm just going to Sniffy Dick Right now. It's just like Dick, you know, they're, they're going agora one, your man, they're pulling some Alpha male shit. You've got to step in and stop them from doing that. These dogs were nothing like that, man. These dogs were so cool. They just had this air about them. Like, hi, hi. Come on. In. Meanwhile they would do bite work, like he would have these dudes in a suit and they would hold them back and they let the dog loose and it was like a meat cannon.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       Like you shot a side of beef of this dude's arm that they would just latch onto the guy and bring him down. I'm like, what a crazy thing. You've engineered this dog that will respond to your. Every command is super intelligent and is gigantic and can mimic the primal attack map and then shut it off and shut it right off the superfund to physically exactly what he's designed to do and do that. Impressed the. That was the most impressive thing to me when we're on fear factors, what people have done with dog breeding and dog training, like dogs that really know their shit. They're impressive man. That's impressive. They have it locked down. They're giving them treats and they're setting them up and they'd given them their affection or given them the recognition for what they'd done. These dogs will do anything. They'll do whatever the fuck you say. No, that's pretty nuts that we figured out a way to do that. Yeah. I always think it's kind of funny that people will. You know, I totally love and respect people, rescuing animals. I think that's a beautiful thing that people do and then there's the other people who will buy like a budget animal, which is definitely coming from a bad place for like 100 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       Sometimes people do the dog and the dog. Yeah, but you know, they expect great results. It's like there's a place where they had like $25 tattoos. You're going to have this for a long time, like make a good investment. But some people just say it's a dog. What could be wrong with it? I've had, I've had a bunch of dogs with like I had this bulldog. He's had to have a bunch of operations. Brian just killed my mind. Sorry. He's got a. he's got a hip dysplasia so he had to get both his arms operated and there was like six grand man. It was serious money. So it was like $18,000 I think for both of his arms. He had have one operation and then had have one like a while later and then they were talking about replacing his back hips and I'm like, listen, this dog is lazy as fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       You don't have to do that. People dog just likes to chill like you don't have to like, yeah, he walks around with a bit of a limp, but he seems happy. He might be in a little pain, but most of the time he's just chilling, you know, he's not a running dog. He's a bulldog. He's just gonna. Relax, you know, like, yeah, he's fucked up. You don't have to give a metal hips. All right. Just let them be fucked up. But that's a dog that was given to me, if that, if that there was a situation as a situation, if they wasn't, I would have never wanted to get a dog like that. I wouldn't want. I would look for dogs that have a genetic propensity for hip dysplasia and stuff like that. And you gotta you gotta think, man, it's, it's wonderful to love a dog and take care of them.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       But you're adopting a giant bag of fucking problems with some animals. You know, if you get them from a good breeder, you know what the fuck you're getting. Yeah. We're uh, we bought a big savannah cat is going to be almost a 30 pound cat. Told me about that. That's insane. And you feed this thing like chicken wings and chicken bones and it just, it, it just sits there. And it will stock it and then just pounce and then I'll grab it and its mouth and throw it up in the air. And Paul it before it gets down to the ground. Just savage? Yeah. Trusted with you. Does it ever get dickie with you totally know. Definitely Alpha mailed it to destroy things? No, he doesn't have that crazy cat instinct where he's going to rip it up. Do you have um, posts for him or something?

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       We do have some posts. And do you use, does he use those? Yes, he does. So he doesn't defy, you know, I get this little motherfucker, this little motherfucker. I got this little cat name Oliver and he's a ragdoll and he's a sweet cat. He's super friendly. Super Sweet. Yeah. Loves coming up. But if you tell him to get the fuck out of here, he's going to keep coming back. Right. It's like, you know, he's going to prove a point. Like he'll, he'll come into my library, has a carpet in and I don't like him licking his asshole on my white carpet. You know, get the fuck out of here at your ass. Dingleberry's are worse than me. I'm looking there as well. Whatever. Just take care of that right away. He's trimmed. I trimmed them, we turn them for the summer because he's a fluffy cat and it gets hot as fuck out here.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       So, uh, anyway, so he, you know, he's looking at his hands hall and this white carpet. I'm like, get the fuck out of here dude. Come on. You got to go. I'm being nice about it. I pushed. Pick them up. I take them out. Thank you. Bye. I go back in. I'm rearranging my shit. I turned back and he's licking his asshole again. Same spot. It's like, what? You can't lick your asshole over there. He wanted to walk back to the exact. No, this is where I want to be. Like, no, I'm the one who decides where I want to be. I want to be right here. I picked him up. I put them out of that room four fucking times, but finally shut the door. I had to shut the door. I had to give up. Will Cock sucker. He tests me, but he's a little tiny cat, you know, if it was like a big survival, that's what they're called.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       Yeah. Well it's bred from service. So they call them Savannah's when they get, you know, one generation removed. So it's a serval mix with a domestic serve will mixed with the domestic. But the breeder, I got them from. They keep, they've been doing it so long. It's mostly savannah. Savannah made exactly is a survival. It's this wild look in mini Cheetah with really long. So wild animal. Holy Wild. They don't train those at all. No. Those are, those are, those are just gone. I mean they live. I mean there's pictures from the breeder, the servers with the children and stuff like that. Like that. They hang out. All right. There was a fear factor show that we did once and it was in this really rural area, really rural, you know, like these people were like living out. There was no one out there. And um, one woman had a dog that got fucked by a coyote and a hal is half coyote, half dog puppies.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       It was a trip food. It was a trip, they were all huddled together because it was freezing cold, bunch of the cast or the crew rather took them home as, as pets because everybody was so heartbroken because it was really cold outside. We were filming in the winter and we're up in like this really, you know, high altitude area, it's cold as fuck. And there's these puppies, a huddled up together like shaken and they're half coyote. Mad. Crazy dog got fucked by some murder beast from the woods. You know, when a dog gets fucked by a coyote, that's kind of be some trippy shit. Got to be an early. Those hyenas people use those dogs. You know? I wonder if though, a wonderful dog fucks coyote if that, if, if a coyote fucks a dog because that's what it is. Usually. Probably. I bet it's on dogs.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Fucking coyote is one of those big. I bet it's a man or mastiffs could fucking. I think you'd kill it. I think it'd kill it, but yeah, I think it would have a war they would go to. It wouldn't, but a male gets to fuck a dog. Yeah. Males can fuck the dogs. That's so creepy, man. Yeah. That's like how wonderful dogs can go back to regular dogs after that, but they just fucked because you ever seen a coyote. His mouth, when they open their jaws, dude, there's like rows of teeth, like a crocodile. That shit goes back. Like the first time I saw a coyote on I was like, Whoa, hold on. Like you start thinking their dogs and then you see a coyote yard. You're like, you've got like 20 extra teeth. You fuck. Scary. Creepy fucking murderers sneaking in and fucking your dog.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       There's this dude that runs down lake and Austin, which is a big bike, big jogging trail. He has three wolves and he just pretends that they're. That they're not. Well, they're beautiful creatures, but that's a little. A little iffy. Yeah. I have a friend who has one. He has one in the fucking thing. Got Out and killed a gang of goats. Killed, like got out of his. He has like a ranch and it got from his ranch and went into the neighbor's ranch and just started at Jack in their animals. Just fuck it up. Everything a little too much. Blood orgy just went over there that you found a pen that was filled with goats. So we jumped into this pen and start carrying these goats. A partner. It was a big one, hundred 6,170 pounds just ripping them apart and I'm like, Bro, you don't have control of this fucking thing man.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Like you gotta be careful. So what does he do? He moves to Hollywood, brings his wolf. Three of them, three of them. This douchebag living in the Hollywood hills. This things out killing deer and shit. I heard wolves aren't even for home invasion either. Like if you come in the home, they're not territorially protected because they have those wide range. It's not like other dogs so immersed in a burglar murder can come in your home and do whatever and then one bolt, but if it threatens you apparently than the willful, it'll protect you. It will protect you. Yeah. Yeah. You're his buddy, but you're not his dad. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's the difference here is buddy. It's like, you know, if your roommate is getting attacked, you're going to jump in. That's not like if your son was getting attacked, okay. You know, or you know, if your father was getting attacked rather, and that's how dogs are.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       Dogs look at you like you're a dad with a wolf. He just like, what's up man? He's got fucking with. You will have like, Yo, Yo, Yo, get that shit outta here. The Wolf is not like you can't come over the wolf's. Not like, who the fuck are you? Let me check you out and make sure you're okay. The Wolf's like, bitch, I know you. Okay, what are you going to do to make stupid? That's how the wolf looks at you. They will not threatened by you. And he's like, oh, are you being nice? Okay, good. Whatever. I got teeth, look at his teeth. I'll fucking kill you dude. They're not worried about your last mile. Yeah, they don't just listen to you. It's totally different situation. It's like for the most part, you're probably going to be okay in the not going to kill anybody, but will's of chill.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       People will kill people. There's a woman got attacked by wolves recently, I think it was in Alaska. I'm not sure where it was, but a woman got attacked and killed by wolves. So it's very rare. And the last time it happened I was like the 19 fifties or some shit. But. So what. So what happened? You know, if, if there was, if there was only like one monster, uh, you know, a fucking Goblin ate some Old Lady's head once in 18, 12. That would be the most haunted woods for the history of time. He'd be like, that thing is real and it's out there and we'll wolves are for fucking sure. Real alright. They, how will you could see them. You can watch documentaries on them. If you go through Wyoming, you're going to see him. You know what I'm saying? Or was it Wyoming?

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       Were werewolves that Wyoming? Are they North Dakota for sure. Like yellowstone. Those are real animals, man. And they'll jack you. And they're smart people. Forget the mythical basis for that mean wolves were real enemies. I mean the expression keep the wolves in the hills and our women in our beds with real babies. You were toasting to that daily, you know, back in the days when it happened. Did they just wise up to our hose gun situation and just like back off with all that shit. I think they got, they got trappers just, you know, decimated the population. Yeah. Yeah. Is that what it is? And then the population is so small now. They don't feel that the strength to fuck with people, right? Yeah. They will fuck up your crops or your cattle though if you have cows or if you have any animals, they will fuck them up. Man. Them and mountain lions.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       I was, I was a kid once and I was reading this comic book and it was a. I used to read a lot of creepy and eerie. Do you remember those comic books? Do you remember those at all? Creepy and eerie were like these really cool comic books that were like black and white, like really cool illustrations. It was all like monster stories and one of them was about this werewolf that was a sneaking into these, uh, God, these people that sheep and they were living in the old west or some shit and had sheep and the Werewolf would sneak into their pen and kill all the sheep, you know, and then the guy goes out there and he gets attacked by this werewolf. And I'm like, wow. Crazy. Would that be if Werewolf was out there sneaking people's pens and killing all the animals?

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       And I thought about it, Mike. Just Cheetahs. Cheetahs do do that. Mountain lions do do that all the time. They got a real point. If you live anywhere near mountain line and you have animals in your yard, you got to read that. Those are game. They're going to just hop over that fence and kill them and drag them in the woods. Why is it, why is a wolf man any scarier than that? I don't know. Maybe because it couldn't have sex with you. The wolf man. It does make the twilight movies, that's for sure. Oh yeah, those guys technically Werewolf. So you know, because they just become a wolf, you know what I'm saying? Then they don't become a werewolf. They've become a wolf. Like that's Kinda Gay. Like you know what I'm saying? Like if you're going to take the time to more be something cool and new American Werewolf in London type hybrid shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       Just be a dog team who have killed that whole thing now after teen wolf to me like, oh, it's a werewolf guy. Wolf. Kill Them. Fucking Michael J. Fox is not scary or that did twilight killed a few for vampires. Vampires are already killed for a time ago. If you think vampires are killed, go watch Gary Oldman. Do Dracula. That's what I'm saying though. But then also watched the million other TV shows and fucking knockoffs. Totally. But if Gary Oldman came out today with the New Dracula, he could rock that shit and you'd be believing in vampires again. But now both man, not too much done. I think he's done. I think that last one with Venetia del Toro that killed it for me. I'm a wolfpack fan, bro. And I couldn't do it. Shit. We've talked about this too many times on the podcasts. I have Wolfman fetishes. I've some crazy fucking werewolf thing. Man, I don't know what it is. Ever since I was a little kid. Loved Werewolf movies. Just like the idea that some sketches. You were drawn werewolves. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. When I was a little kid, even before high school, a lot of them are like from when I was 12 and 13, I'm fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       Tap into something primal and Joe Rogen some fucking. Pardon me. That's why I moved to the woods, man. There's some part of me that wants to be out with that. Has Anybody Seen Joe Rogan on a full moon and why is he tweeting at 6:00 AM? It's really sad because I can't live in the jungle if I could live in the jungle. I live in the jungle, but there's no jungle in America. So I choose the woods. I really would like to be just living around animals and shit. Well, it's got to represent some primal part of all of us. You know there's something, there's some energy I think that you sound so hippy, faggy bullshit. So true man. It's like certain energy when you're around these animals. Like one of the people that I lived near up there was this crazy yoga lady, very nice lady, but crazy yoga lady and I was talking to her about like mountain lions.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       I'm like, listen, how do you. How do you guys deal with the fact there's mountain lions? Because there's a fucking corner store up there that had a sign that if you get attacked by a bear, you should play dead and if you're attacked by a mountain lion, you should fight back. I'm like, what the fuck? You have strategies to deal with different monsters jacking you. You're going to play dead by a bear is biting the fuck out of you. Really? You're really gonna do that. Are you going to be able to do that? Holy Shit. So I said, how do you deal with this? How do you deal with the fact that you are around these, these beasts?

Speaker 3:          00:19:53       She goes, I just let them all in. When I walked through the woods, I let them know that I'm here among you. I'm no threat. I love, I love you and I love them and I just walked through and I've never had a problem like, bitch, you've been so lucky. Zigged, when you could have zagged, you could have walked right onto a mother. Cougar protected are young. You could have fucked up and walked into a fucking grizzly bear and he could have been with its cobs and freaked out and decided to eat your face. You got lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       You see all. You see all those documentaries hang out with these predators long enough. Why do people think that they are better than dear? Why do you think that if there's love in nature, why does it really? It's all love. Why does nature let this murderous cougar snap this deers fucking neck and suck the blood out and then eat its guts

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       first? Because that's what they do. They go God's first cause they don't eat grass. Then they get their vegetation by eating the guts of the things that kill, but it wouldn't happen to you. Why would it happen to the deer and not to you? Just you really get thanked. The universe gives a fuck if you're around a Predator and it wants to eat and it looks at you and says, I think I ate one of these back in the nineties. I'll try it again. It was good. Yeah. I only get a hiker once every 10 years, but fuck it. Yeah. They got that Muesli in their system. Yeah, Dude, they'll jack you. Especially when they get used to it. Like that's a the. There's an area I talked about in my act, an area in India called the cinder bands and they have a real problem with tigers there because the congress have gotten used to eating people.

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       The tsunamis typhoons rather. They wash a lot of bodies into the river. A lot of people drowned musical with fucking villagers. Man. These people are really poor. They're living in shacks on the river in India and the Tigers eat the bodies that drown and so they get a taste of human flesh and they just started jacking people. Just Jack and people go through the article anywhere, Bro. There's videos on Youtube and look this up folks, if you're, if you're, if you're at home or when you get home, you got to check out Sunderbans Tigers because there's a bunch of cool documentaries online and one of them, these poor fox, these guys are census takers, so they have to find out how many of these murderous monsters are out there in the tall grass, in the fucking tall grass out on a boat. So what did this guy, this guy has a rifle and he's got a helmet on.

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       Okay. And the helmet has a mask on the back of the head because tigers like to sneak up behind you and jack you. They don't want you to see them coming. They just want a jacket. So these guys were wearing helmets to protect themselves from getting jacked by monsters and they have a mask with a fucking face on the back of the head with a tigers. Figured it out after a while that it was just a face. So they started jacking guys from the back. Anyway, even though they have these face on, a bunch of dudes in the census, takers get killed by tigers with fucking masks on, so now they're fucked. These things can swim, so they have to make sure that the boat has an engine so they can swim faster than the tiger can. They can run 50 miles an hour and they've killed 300,000 people in the last 200 years.

Speaker 3:          00:22:58       Since then you'd think that someone would take up the challenge and be like, all right, tigers were smarter, dude. People are like, you know, hey, they're a part of nature. They're part of miniature. Some regards there, right? I mean, what makes us that much better? Because we have the guns. This is ridiculous. We don't need them around. It's so stupid. Kill them all. What are you crazy? The people in India should be. We are worried about the extinction of the Tigers. You shouldn't be worried. You should be worried about your fucking murder. Murderers master that lives in the jungle. Yeah, you've got to keep it alive. It's your God. Are you crazy? Are you fucking that attached to these animals that want to kill people? Good. Guide them down, man. Gun the more. Put human masks on the back of the Tigers and really confused everything. Yeah, that's what you're gonna do. But I going to find the tiger and put

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       a basket on it. How dare you just suck it up. Did you try to trick the Tigers that we're trying to. What I'm saying? Look confused everything, you know, there'll be people with tiger maps in the back of their heads and tigers with human mass. If you could transfer human consciousness into anything, if you could transfer human consciousness into, um, a, like an animal just to see what it'd be like, how dope would it be to be able to download your fucking brain into a tiger's body and just live it? Move in the, run it shit. You're fucking insane. Would that be man? If you could just control the body of a tiger with a human mind? Fuck other tigers.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       Damn. How crazy would that feel? Right? You know, oh my God, fuck this. This is even when she freaks out, you got this. You know, will allow it to intimidate you even though it's a tiger and you've got your dick inside of her. You have no fear in full control of this thing. Last for 20 seconds, just loads into her. Just shoot tiger loads into. That would be insane, man. I would think though, if I had to choose, I would take eagle. I would like to be an eagle. That would be the dopest thing ever. Yeah, because equals get to because jack fish, bro. Fucking national animal for a reason. Have some respect. You know the Turkey. The Turkey was supposed to be our national animal. Really? Benjamin Franklin was putting forward this. The Turkeys. Turkeys. The smartest bird that would have made us less do see Canada, they have a maple leaf. They're all chill up there. We're going to fucking kill her bird. We eat once a year. An Eagle Turkey.

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       If, if we didn't have the eagle, maybe we wouldn't be so douchey because the ego is such a douchey animal. Just like, bitch, why would you want an eagle? First of all? Because Eagles don't give a fuck about anybody. You ever looked into an eagles eyes. That's like the pits of hell. They don't give a fuck about you if you're holding them and feeding them everyday and they were a little little thing on your arm and you get shot in the head with a howitzer, they'll go, well I guess I'm not hanging out here anymore. There's fly away. They don't get sad. They don't feel bad. Those birds of prayer trip, there was a hawk that landed on our ranch and we knew something was off with it because it was just hanging around the house. So my parents were like, all right, we got to try and bring it in.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       We got to try and get it to the bed or something. Whoa. So they sent me with a kitchen where they sure have bullets. Yeah, exactly. With the kitchen glove and a little piece of steak yet though. So I'm like going very slowly, like looking at this hawk and the. I like thinking of the options. Do I do I run like what happened? But you know, it turned out that it was the domesticated hawk, so I was able to give it to meet and then it dug it and then it hopped on the kitchen glove that's brought it into the house they rescued it. Does it for, for that to have happened? I don't know. I'm glad I found out because we asked him like, have you done this before? Yeah, we do have time on your glove, Bro. What animal would you be? Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       Brian's on a date, Chris. And that was right there with you. Oh actually we have to know the answer to one of those things. If someone asks you, what's your favorite color? Like, Yo, shut up Dick. Meanwhile, it is a valid question. Maybe you have a reason why you're into violet. I'm into purple, Fuchsia, Fuchsia, Fuchsia, car, radical hidden camera on trademarks. I'm kind of pink. Is it? Did really good for trademark it. Boy. Hobby Vasquez. He fights in pink shorts. He wears. He wears pink. A pink little fucking tighties when he. When he fights, he fights fights to strikeforce. A bad motherfucker. We fights for WC. Excuse me, he was fighting for a. You want to King of the cage title? He Won. He's fought in Japan and one over there. He always wears pink shorts. He doesn't give a fuck. No one wants to be close up to see if the stars are clearing out.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       It's just pink shorts and a package. There's another dude that, dude, I'm the fuck is his name. Tim Kennedy. Tim Kennedy always trains with pink gloves. He wears these big fucking girly looking pink gloves. But he's like, he's like, when you're a fierce motherfucker you can wear pink. Right? I can totally make sense. You know, how did the color get to be so disparaged? Why the traditional girl color? I mean, what is if people gave it to girls on the, on the baby shower day, you know, so it was just try why they end up pink all over the world. There's not like, are they in the like in Transylvania, a little girls in a black little, little, little goth girls make the big colorful little girls the prettiest color. You know, I think if you're, you don't want red because that's like an eagle pass my faggot test piece.

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       The prettiest sparkly pink. Get to keep the name pink. You know the singer pink is nobody else been pink. How does that mean? That bitch got the best name for a chick. Could have ever like, what's the girliest should ever gangster all girls love pink deserves it. But she does deserve it. She's, she's a bad ass, you know that uh, I wrote a whole blog about watching her perform at the emmy's that I watched. I watched her perform and I was like, you gotta be fucking shitting me. Like that was just sheer brilliance in coordination with perfect singing and just just so in tune with the crowd and had everyone mesmerized. It was fucking beyond. Yeah. But I'm just shocked that nobody got paint before. I mean, she's not old. It's not like she got there first like nobody thought to call themselves pink. It seems like there probably was. I bet some fucking dummy that just didn't trademark it. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:29:47       Way before that whole Charlie Chaplin was pink. Once she don't, she don't. She heard about me, she heard about me. I created my name, my name.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       There's always when, whenever someone famous gets famous, there's always someone that thinks that the, the, that happens all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:30:12       Oh, he's got my whole act. That's my whole routine. I was doing that in the catskills. Everything

Speaker 1:          00:30:18       he knows. I've heard that story so many times that a guy makes it and then you go, Oh, you know that guy made it. But there was a guy back in like Michigan who was scared to leave town, but he was the guy he learned from that guy like you, like there's like creamer. This is a real Kramer Kramer from Seinfeld, but there's a real dude. He calls himself the real Kramer and he gives tours of New York. He was the guy that burst through doors, like universally acknowledged as the guy who inspired that character. So he somehow or another, they let them capitalize on it and gives tours and shit, which has got to be so twisted. Yeah. And Boring. Maybe not man. Maybe for him it's like the shit, you know, maybe if he was a dentist he'd be bored and maybe if I, my dentist had his job, he'd be terrified. Maybe. Maybe the dentist themselves mean who knows what, if he made really supposed to be Kramer, the guy's got to be very eccentric. Right. I mean if that's really the guy who they, they. Yeah. You know, after you. Fuck what, what does that guy do now? I've seen him in randomly and placements and appearances. Railing recently. You're talking about Kramer? Yeah, the real one. Yeah. What the fuck's his knees about to go on somehow. Forgot how. Come on. Michael Richards. Thanks. He just attacked the photographer the other day. Did he take it together?

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       I guess he punched him and stuff. That's one of the worst predicaments in the history of the media for an actor, for an actor to have done that was one of the worst predicaments, you know, that's like, you know, like people have caught people with hookers, like hugh grant got busted with hookers and you know, and Alec Baldwin yelled at his kid. That's all good. But you know, it's not that bad. No. Right. The world out here as a nigger, there's, look, we have a nigger, he says Joe, and I mean, I know it. I know what he was trying to do. Spoil alert. What is trying to spoil spoiling, right? What he was trying to do is say something completely shocking and somehow another rescue himself from a bad situation where he was bombing and he wanted to figure out how to get them out to hurt them. How to shop, how to let them know that he didn't give a fuck. You know, like, Oh, you're going to fuck with my show. Think it's okay. Oh you

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       think because I'm on Seinfeld, I won't get crazy at you. Oh look, here's a nigger. Look, we have some niggers, you know. And everybody was like, Whoa, what the fuck? It's shocking. But what's most shocking to me is that that word still works. It's one of the few still freak out though has magic in it still has that ability to affect people. It's interesting. It's amazing. The only one left. The other one I think couldn't have done it. I have a whole bit about the three magic words, love, Nigger, and count. Those are the three words are the three magic words that have the word love always has way more power than than any other words you could string together. Like I care about you so much. I think about you all day. I just. I don't know what it is. I just want him around you.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       I want to be affectionate and do you love me? You have to say it. You have to say I love you. I love. Oh well, we're in. We're in the house. We're in the house. We all go in and that's magic word number one. Can't sort of. But that's getting used a lot. It gets tossed, especially in a walmart cards now, so I don't think it's hallmark using cut and cards in England. They can't all the time. Everything's caught this fucking cunt. Fucking dudes. Yeah. Yeah. This fucking cunt over here. Yeah. They, they start it up so much that it's like this fucking dude. It's like they're saying, dude are going to be left with two words, but. But niggers still very, very controversial. You know, and just even the joke of my act, I would say that even saying it's a word like I'm not even calling anybody yet, we're just saying the word and you're like candyman candyman character.

Speaker 3:          00:34:14       It is like that. It's like you're in your, you're, you're saying and in contention is going to bring violence your way. Like you, you are, you are using a bad word. You're not even calling anybody anything. You just saying that this word exists. And in, in, in incanting it and saying it out loud, you know, you run the risk of violence. That's amazing. That's amazing that it's 2010 and we think that's okay. I think it's one of the few words were, I can't even hear my own voice saying [inaudible]. I don't think I've had the courage to voice. It's just a word. I say it all the time and you fucking tell me how you do. Tell me what you say. Fucking nigger. Whoa. That was offensive. Brian. I thought you were going to say n word, n word. That's even more offensive pictures. Feel free to swear in front of you.

Speaker 3:          00:34:59       You might be wearing a wire, you dirty n word, but she's not really one, so it's not bad. You know, if she was really a black then it would feel bad, but she's white. Could be white. You could be a white nigger. I think that's an a song somewhere. I'm sure it is. What's a wigger no nigger brand? Stop saying that. It's uncomfortable for everyone. We just weirded out half. Wouldn't have America ridiculous as 100,000 people this thing. Listen folks, so they're just words. That's the point. It's a ridiculous point that's been argued throughout time. It shouldn't, shouldn't be still going on. It shouldn't be. It should always be your intent. It should always be like whenever you're in any environment where you're not allowed to say certain words, you make that environment at least 20 percent bullshit at all times. Any work environment that you're at, nobody's really totally being themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       Everybody has to have this stupid guard up because you can't say company can't say fuck, and you can't say shit and you can't talk honestly about how you feel about things. No, you're in a professional working environment except that flashlight. I'll have to accept that. Especially Chris by the way works at flashlights. Chris is, what is your exact job over there was your vp of marketing and business that he's a. The reason why we made the connection and uh, he's also the reason why they have an avatar flashlight. Let me say this correct. Just as a correction. This is not, I say I was the alien pussy realities. We blue. We actually launched this two years ago with we totally, which is our space. We pushed this out two years ago. It was just a space vagina. We put some girls and some blue lipstick and.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       Oh, so this was. But it just happens that they're super hot. And here's the, that you didn't even make it look like a vagina at all. I like how you did that. Like doubleclick is a whole bunch of thought of this. The mold inside is like a bunch of eggshells. Greg's every site has a, the bowl has like different ribs inside. The urban myth, is that an urban myth, the razor blade in the vagina from Vietnam, is that an urban myth? I've never been do that. You never heard that? Now hookers would take these back in Vietnam was like when I was a kid in high school. When you're growing up in Boston, back in Vietnam, I heard what they did. They took a razor blades and they put them up the girl's vagina and he'd fuck them and cut your Dick and half. You never heard that before?

Speaker 3:          00:37:26       I hung out with a bad crowd. If you heard of the rape condoms. I've heard of those. Yeah. They have little spikes that stick. They shove it in the girl. The girl shoves it inside of her like a Tampon. Okay. And it's basically like an interior lining for her vagina that's filled with barbs. Like fucking with fish hook type deals. So these guys, they rape a lot apparently in Africa. It's like a serious, serious problem. Super in right now. It's like one out of three women in Africa has been raped. Certain areas of Africa, and this is one of the areas where they're pushing these rape condoms, like those guys are going to kill now. Now it's not just going to be raped, it's going to be rape and murder. You know, if a guy sticks his dick inside you and comes out bloody and covered with fish hooks, chances are I might hit you, right? Yeah. He's raping you an asshole that he would so give you a moment, but it was such an asshole that he would rape you. You don't think he'll kill you if you cut his dick up, guys, a piece of shit, you know he's not going to go you, you were really shouldn't have raped you. I got fish hooks on my dick. I deserve it. Yeah. No, he's going to attack you, right? I would

Speaker 5:          00:38:35       assume. Yeah. I just thought I was actually out there in Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and out with some of the tribes when we were working with some of the men out there to try and actually instill traditional martial arts into them so that they could see some kind of martial arts in the tribesmen. Yeah, and some of the inner inner city to slum kids because really they have a whole generation of fathers that are gone from aids, just no father figures so they have no nothing else to really go to. So they get picked up by gangs, they get picked up by these war parties and then they get turned into little killer. So what we trying to do is show them some kind of paternal discipline and show them that they can be strong and powerful without having to be in a gang. And it was a really cool program and it worked, but it's fucking intense out there, man.

Speaker 5:          00:39:18       Really intense. We ended up having to stop the program because civil war broke out in Kenya and it was just too nutty to keep doing it. Damn it was. It was pretty crazy over there teaching them martial arts. Yup. Wow. Very true. Like traditional stylized, you know, we weren't going into MMA ground and pound. She's like discipline karate type through the Kata and definitely speaking to them and they. I mean they dug it. I know it's kind of interesting that Africa is not known for martial arts, you know, it's like Africa is the cradle of civilization, right? That's where humans emanated from. But really martial arts didn't really pick up until they got to like Asia. I mean there was other martial arts are developed in other countries, but for whatever reason I think it's because Africa was so fucked up. They just went straight to weapons. Like, what are we doing?

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       Karate Chop. Give me a gun, another gun, give me a pointy stick, man. Give me some shit. I gotta stab some fucking animals with some hyenas trying to eat my kids. All right. You can't just, you know, fucking box of like in Ireland how many tiny man in Ireland, you know, what do they have to worry about? Deer gets into your yard. You know what I'm saying? They had time to beat the fuck out of each other. Whiskey bottle. They didn't even bother learning mma. I didn't even bother with take downs or leg kicks or anything like that. Like, ah, this is good enough. Just here's our hands. We don't need to get crazy with the knees. Come on a flattery, elbows and against the rules. That's why you hit me with that. We're not trying to kill each other. Then in Africa they're like, fuck you.

Speaker 1:          00:40:46       They're going right for pointy sticks to your chest. Poison Darts and shit. Blow guns. Yeah. They're just trying to. They're trying to jack you. The exception is the Greco Roman style wrestling with some of the tribes out. Really good. Greco and Africa. Some of the tribes. That's how. That's what determines the Alpha and the tribe. Really. All kinds of crazy rituals like they have good technique. Do you think you could take their back? Yeah, dude, no way. No way you can get them to get on top. Sweep his ass. Got No baby all tearing web regard. You Ain't know. You know about my lockdown popping up and down. All the sudden he's choked out. She could have gone on your bitch. You got a problem. You've got a deep problem. It got with shit and his loin cloth. So what kind of wrestling and they do. Well, it's just like,

Speaker 5:          00:41:32       you know, like Greco Roman,

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       you know, Nicole, do they understand under hooks hook. So what kind of throws throws that are like judo throws, throws, throws. I mean you like an all American restaurant. I'm rolling Jack All. I mean they don't have the nutrition and the training and eating bugs and shit. Then I go for you Greco bugs that are good for your regular drinking some stuff out the goat blood. Have you, you know, we were talking about this on the show before, but in Africa, trip panning and when you cut a hole into the top of the head, have you ever seen that? No. Dude, some tribes in Africa, the gnarliest shit to their bodies and I've always tried to figure out what that is. We're where, where, where's that coming from? But one of them is trapping t r e p a n and what it means cutting a hole through the skull and exposing the brain.

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       And this one guy had done it 20 times. Antiseptic conditions? No. Yeah, they're doing it with coconut shells and shit. Fucking cut your head open with a sharp rock. And I'm not joking, they are using rocks and shit, carving, carving, no, no anesthetic whatsoever. Carving into dude skulls. And then the women in Surrey who cut the hole in their lip and they put plates in and the bigger the plate, the more cows you're worth when you get married. Like what is that about? What is all those? Those are tough to figure out. The ones that are on vacation, they did a lot of that one that's easier to figure out. But I think it's maybe the worst is the clutter ectomies are done by the masseuse. Traditional math. I mean just them, right? More bad and it's just know. And then once, you know, once they do that, like sex is just never pleasurable.

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       So I mean it's, you know, they're trying to do it, do it because they're haters, they're haters. They can't, they have no game and they want to control these chicks for life. And then the chick turns 22 wises up be like, dude, you fucking smell. I'm not into this relationship. I'm going to get some good Dick. Right? And she tries to leave and to my property. And then they have problems, you know, it's a bunch of haters, man. It's all those faggots and won't let chicks dance. All those dudes who want to put chips in Burkas and shit, but your eyes, you know, they want them to walk around like they're inside of a trashcan looking through a slot. I'll totally insecurity. There's little faggots, bitch ass people living in the middle of nowhere for sure. If it's the dumbest place in the world because it's the first place.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       I always say that, that the Middle East is basically they like the townies of the world because that is where written language was created. I mean the Middle East is responsible for so many firsts. You know, Mesopotamia Babylonia, where Iraq is ancient Sumerian or they had the first written language, the first agriculture, the first government, the first astrology, the first astronomy. I mean they had a lot of, a lot of first, there was a brilliant, brilliant place. I mean so much. So much development, but everybody, like in all good places, they got tired of the Douche bags and he moved and everybody's spread out. Civilization spread out across the country. It's just like America. If you go the east coast, you get a lot of holdouts. That's what it is. A lot of stubborn people that go, I fucking like in here, fuck everybody else and what they really are is the grandchildren and children of fucking savages.

Speaker 3:          00:44:46       People in Ireland and Poland and England, that that life over there sucked so much cock that they were willing to get in a boat for months and come to them someplace, didn't even know what the fuck it was, and suddenly they get there and then they huddle up and they try to figure out this new place and fight off the fucking Indians. Do whatever they have to do to make a business and get everybody's smart goals. There's got to be someplace better than this. Let's get the fuck out of here. And they started traveling west. Devote your vital energy to something besides bear survival. Yeah, so the VAT is the civilization beginning. Assume Sumir and that is Iraq and that is the Middle East, the middle. That's why the Middle East is so fucked up. That's where there's such haters over there,

Speaker 6:          00:45:26       you know, I have, I have a theory that I don't think has been explored very much, but it seems like in the desert areas of the world, they're very patriarchal dominated, you know, and then you get to the coast land, you get to the jungles, they have a lot more matriarchal societies that have a lot more respect for women and the religions or appear different. Something about that dry, arid landscape. And of course, you know, the major desert religions, Judaism, Christianity, Islam has really taken hold there. But for whatever reason, that kind of patriarchal dominance that occurs out there and those

Speaker 3:          00:45:57       different. Yeah, it's a hard life. It demands hard, hard living, you know, you have to make, you got to be. And you also have to realize that they had this hard radical ideology thousands and thousands of years ago and a hard radical ideologies. It's very difficult to break without a revolution. It doesn't sort of evolve, you know, if their ideology about like, and I don't know how recent it's been that they've been so strict with women with the glitter ectomies and with the Burkas and I mean how, how recent has that been? I mean it's still going on there, right? But I mean when did it start? I mean, how it is it, is it something that's been going on for hundreds and thousands of these? 100? I don't know. I don't know. When you have a situation where there's a lot of fear and a lot of religious fanaticism, it's really hard to change because everybody's scared.

Speaker 6:          00:46:43       Well, even the females for the clitoral ectomies, some of them feel like they can't become a woman until they get it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       It's so ingrained. So if they make it illegal, what's, it's actually forcing some women underground to get them done and even worse conditions than the flint rock and a chisel or whatever

Speaker 6:          00:46:59       done. So it's a, it's a nightmare. I mean, you really got to attack it with education, you know? I mean that's the only real option.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       It's a, it's one of those things where I think about, you know, there's certain, certain levels of fear when it gets, when fear gets ingrained into a culture and when it's control and that's what a lot of that is a lot of this, the controlling of lemon with the clothing and the dancing and you know, to try to prevent other men from fucking them and all that craziness. Right. When, when that should get a hold of a culture, it's very hard to get it out. You know what I'm saying? Like it takes like a new person or a person. Sure. Yeah, sure. Absolutely. But at least a culture or a person rather than responsible for themselves. Like people can wake up and go, Hey, I'm a douche bag. I need to snap out of this. It's very difficult for a culture to wake up and go, hey, we're fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:47:44       You know, look what we're doing overseas. Look at were pretending that this is going on and we're making billions and we've got all these fucking dummies that are listening to us. We can do better. Right. It's very rare that a culture wakes up, we're a government wakes up or any large group, but a person can wake up. Right. You know, I mean, I think the best thing to do would be to put Internet kiosks fucking everywhere or just put that in satellite Internet. Just get them out there and have them watch spice girls. Like at that point, you know, they're going to say a quitter and kind of do that with the laptops you have. You seen those things as like, are they getting into. They're like throwing them in, but they. Yeah, they definitely need some big inoculation of the retardation they've gone through for decades and hundreds and thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       You know, they need something to get them to evolve. When you get like people that are just so wacky about a certain ideology to the point where there is so nutty that you're not even allowed to draw their main dude. No. Yeah. Think how crazy that is. You can't draw their main guy or they'll kill you. Why do we tolerate this? Why does anyone tolerate that? That is absolutely crazy. Yeah. Like, it's not saying no one saying that Mohammed doesn't exist or never did exist, or he's not a prophet. He might very well be, I'm, I am completely uneducated to that matter, but you're telling me that you can't draw them. Come on, that's silly. One of the tenants, I had a great philosophy instructor when I was going to school and one of the tenants that he thought he was philosophy of religion, a specialist, and he said, any God that should be worship should be worthy of worship.

Speaker 3:          00:49:16       You know, so if you're a god in someone's drawing you and you're going to Mike them, I mean that dude isn't worthy of followers that smite. Right? But it's because it was fighting because they feel it's an offense to God right now. Like if someone's drawing you, you're not going to get pissed. So does that mean that you're better than God? It can't be. You can't have a system where you know the god isn't worthy of worship and being as good as another man. And this was my, my thought is that all of this is seem. It seems so archaic and ridiculous. It seems so several thousand years ago, it's amazing that this kind of ideology is allowed to live through this age of information like deep into the two thousands. So that's. That's fascinating. It's fascinating. Yeah, it is. I think there's a real grain of truth at the bottom of all these religions says I'm beautiful things.

Speaker 3:          00:50:05       I mean, I'm sure in the Koran, you know, I'm not as familiar as I am with some of the other works, but I've seen a little bit, here's beautiful passages, spiritual, spiritual, and really powerfully beautiful passages and all that. But then, you know, men get in there and they're able to utilize that as a mechanism of power to wield more power over other people. It just gets kinda twisted. What's the origin of it all? I mean, if it isn't the word of God, what is it? Is it smart people who figure some things out and somehow or another figure out how to tell it to people and those people tell it to each other for thousands of years and then it eventually gets written down and by that point it's become fables and the words have been twisted and things have gotten strange and the translations are off the memories off, you know, I mean if you're dealing with something as big as the Bible, how many hundreds of pages that it's a lot. It's a lot. So you do try to like say it is a spoken word thing for like a thousand years and then they wrote it down.

Speaker 6:          00:51:01       It was a while and they had a council to decide, you know, it was like an editing where they decided which now this goes in.

Speaker 3:          00:51:07       How about the fucking New Testament, the new testament that even better than that, there were candidates for the new testament. They just threw out there, like the editor just recently redid it. Oh, the region is. Yeah. They have like a newer, newer tests. Yeah. I was just talking to Jesus and shit and he got some old notes. We've got some old Tupac tapes and Jesus is like Tupac. They're redoing his words, talking snake sheet with a bunch of apostles that willing to and all that. I don't care if we know Jesus. They chose

Speaker 6:          00:51:36       words that fitted their fitted their agenda.

Speaker 3:          00:51:38       Yeah. Well that was constantine. That was one constant team was controlling Rome. He's. He was a smart dude. He realized he needed a rope people up with one universal religion. It couldn't be pagan

Speaker 6:          00:51:48       that at that point though, the slave class had really outnumbered, you know, the other classes. So he was, you know, he says it came to him in a dream or whatever, but I think he was trying to survive the Christianity spread in the lower classes. I mean they idealize that theory that they were going to go to heaven and all these rich people who are putting them to work and doing shitty stuff to him, they were going to go to hell. So it took off and then he was like, oh shit. Almost our entire country is slaves. I'm a Christian. Like Bam, I had a dream, you know, and, and then that's what, that's what did it, you know, he says it came to him in a dream, but really I think it was survival.

Speaker 3:          00:52:20       The Christians were just taken over that

Speaker 6:          00:52:22       it was just too many in that lower class versus the patricians who were well outnumbered at that point.

Speaker 3:          00:52:28       That's fascinating. So it was a survival move more than control move.

Speaker 6:          00:52:32       I think so at that point, the adoption of Christianity, it was like he saw the flood, you know, he saw the tide's going and he was going to either get trampled by it or he was gonna go with.

Speaker 3:          00:52:41       Wouldn't you have loved to been in that war meeting? Yeah, for real. All right, well how are we going to handle this? I go, we got some shit. Some shit is going down. This is what people. They would pitchforks and torches and shit. Yeah. Feeding him to the lions was just so mad at that point. Let's tell him. We found Jesus. I liked that sound. We found God. I'm fucking. I'm born again. I don't know about y'all. Are you born again? I'm totally bored again. We can still keep everything going as usual. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We bring them in. We're going to have to include them, but they're not going to kill us. Okay. We're good. We're born again. We're born again. History has changed and he didn't even become a Christian until right before he died. Yeah. You know, right. Wasn't he baptized before he died? The timing for

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       a long time in a while. I mean, he didn't start leading, tucking my fucking head in the water. You got to do it. You got to do it. They don't believe you unless you do it. Fucking kitten. The water, the water sucks. It's cold. You got to do their thing. Get in the water is on point is you posted a video about him, but I've read all of his books. Is John Shelby spong. Um, why Christianity must change or die? I think you actually posted a youtube video. I'm sure it did. Yeah. And uh, he's a preacher who were Kinda is commenting and very devout Christian who's commenting on, you know, the way Christianity has gone. And second book is why Christianity must change or die, and it's really a poignant book for anybody interested in. He was super fascinating. He was like, we're on the control business.

Speaker 5:          00:54:07       This is all the control. But he was like so upfront about it, like his whole entire career that he had brutally honest. His first book goes through different passages and basically attacks the fundamentalist position of Christianity and says, look, you know, this doesn't make sense. This was a book. It was a guidebook. You know, there's lots of stuff that doesn't make a lot of sense in here anymore. You know, let's go through this, let's get rid of this. And then a second book philosophically talks about how the evolution and Christianity needs to be in order for that religion to survive. And I think ultimately it will. I think it's happening like the fire and brimstone that used to be, you know, that Bosch paintings of people just getting ripped apart. And if you go to El Duomo in Florence, you look up at the ceiling and there's demons with these big, giant, big giant.

Speaker 5:          00:54:49       Wouldn't flaming staff shoving it in people's asses? It's like shoving one in, some girl's pussy in. You're in this church, beautiful church and you're like, what the fuck is up here? Like ill Duomo, Duomo. It's the center church in the middle of Florence. Climb up this fucking bananas. Might have to see them. I mean I've been there. Do they have. They must have the photos. Yeah, for sure. Sure. So what is the story behind all that? Well, I mean at that point, I mean there were pushing the. Well it was for sodomy and adultery and that was the crimes being punished, but they would be punished by the Duomo. It's you. I think it might be ill since it's Italy and then d, u o, m o it's in Italy. Those crazy Italian. But I mean just, just not emad. Italians are so nuts, man. I'm Italian.

Speaker 5:          00:55:43       I grew up with. But it's because there are so savage that they're always riddled with guilt. Yeah. They're just so fucking staring. The leftover Romans, man, that's real shit. Where's the photos of the dragons in the assholes and shit. So it's going to be the interior of the dome. The dome need to see this so beautiful fucking building shit. Stunning. I mean it's stunning. They need some dope ass architecture. I did. They were on point. Not Amazing. Isn't that amazing that if like if you look at like the Vatican, you know, and looking like a lot of the shit from like the like all the shit that Davinci painted, like the Sistine Chapel and stuff like no one does anything like that these days. Some of the sculptures. I looked at some of the work by this artist named Bernini and I sat this one and it was a, it was a lady sitting on the pillows, the name a name a while Bernini actually did the ones that were like Daphne and Apollo and the rape of [inaudible] 70 and just to look at how they.

Speaker 5:          00:56:45       He was able to sculpt someone's fingers digging into someone's flesh. Like Haiti's is digging into perceptive. He's into her side, like grabbing the side of it and you cannot believe that it's marble. I mean just the way that he makes it like flashy and lifelike. Canova did the same thing with this lady reclining on a pillow, just sculpting sheets out of, out of marble that looked like they're, you know, you could fluff them in the breeze just incredibly you. It's all this stuff just passed on through generation after generation of learning how to work with stone and carve and. Yeah. Fuck yeah. That'll never be duplicated. Yeah. It's like no, just way too lazy carbon shit. Fuck all the weaknesses and the marble and envisioning what could come out of it. But we'll do some crazy shit. Like walk through the Amazon will do some shit.

Speaker 5:          00:57:37       Like I'm going to be the first guy like Douche bag. Do you know you can take a boat and it's like a few hours you go all around. Well you know what's even crazier than walking through the Amazon. Have you seen the documentary? Big River Man. The dude who swam the Amazon bods, he swam the Amazon. Oh, this one will be easy to bring. It goes. It is a big river man.com. And see that dude is not. So he's from like a rounded die. Well he, he does pretty much take 65 days, right. So it's this documentary of this guy and he started swimming because he had this alcoholic father and his father would come home and try and beat him. He's in eastern Europe, try and beat them. So you figure it out. They figured out if he went in the river, his dad wouldn't follow them and so you just swim and his dad would chase him along the riverside one.

Speaker 5:          00:58:20       And so eventually he learned to be this stamina, endurance swimmer, but he got all fucked in the head, you know, and so he goes out and he swam all of the world's biggest rivers and so it goes out on the Amazon and I just thought it's happened to catch this late night and I was just amazed and he doesn't do it. Like a normal swimmer would like take their protein and do that. He's like getting them to throw bottles of wine in the water and whiskey. He comes off, he drinks two bottles of wine and he's not even in shape. He's like, he's kind of like Chubby, you know? And, and he gets there, but then around day 14, you know all the parents, he's drinking the water from the Amazon, so all the sites get him. He has an onboard doctor and he's like shocking himself with electroshock therapy to kill the parasites and he's like screaming with stuff and like batteries attached to them. It's not easy. But then around the 40th day, the last you ever hear from him in the documentary, he goes, I'm crossing into the fourth dimension now, and he just fucking gone at that point, just gone. And then say he'll like wake up early in the morning and swim away from the boat and they won't know where he is

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       now. Like pointing their light out and trying to find him. They see him naked on some river bank looking at driftwood just because he was just fucked to begin with. Or was it all the parasites? I think it's the parasites and just not taking care of himself. Exhaustion. He so sunburned. He asked to wear this mask. He looks like silence of the lambs. This mask covering his face. Holy Shit. It's nutty. Big River man is the name of it. Martin strehle I believe is his name had. It's funny. There's some motherfuckers. It is a broad spectrum of human beings. It's broad. Yeah. You know, just when you think you've got people completely figured out, you'll find some new one online. You'll see some new shit. I guess when he was swimming the Yangtze, it was so dirty and some of the industrial areas that he had to have nightly blood transfusions from a nurse on the boat, just new blood in blood out and he just kept swimming.

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       Pictures of that swim or just insane. You know, he wants to swim all of the biggest rivers of the world. What is it about people doing dangerous shit that they don't have to do? It's one thing that if you get thrown into the Amazon, you have to figure out a way to swim, to stay alive and make it to the shore and then get back to safety. I survived in the woods. Yeah. I started a fire with rocks. I know how to get back and I got back and I made it. That's an excellent story, but when you thrust yourself into that situation, like that's not a game, that's a river. Well, I think that is that it's not the survival instinct that is propagated this species. It's the instinct to reproduce and doing dangerous shit has always gotten checks and really that's what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       Yeah. I mean, how do you, how do you account for chicks that like getting hot air balloons and go across the world. How about this chick who's rolling her way? She's on a sail boat. She's like 16 and she's sailing across the ocean. What's that about? She's a lesbian. She's trying to get some. I don't know. I mean I think that's some kind of, you know, some kind of tapping into the same. Some of the same instincts. I mean two lesbians trying to pick up street chicks is just as creepy as dudes trying to pick up straight checks. My girl certainly gets her. That's her fair share. I was at the mailbox and I'm about Senate package and this, uh, there's this lesbian lady and she's like, so obviously dykey just big and she's got a mullet and it's, it's, it's like the whole deal right now and she's got legs up going out of her way and Eddie Bravo, Falcon wristband. It's like a leather strap on arrest and the girl in front of her is a getting a package, you know, and um, uh, she dropped something. She was like, Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so disorganized. And the lesbian goes, don't apologize for being human. I was like, oh, it was so gross. I literally put my hand up to my mouth. I went like, it was so like, sleazy. Here's my card, you know, it was so

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       like low rent, you know, traveling, vacuum salesman, trying to fuck somebody, his wife, you know what I mean? It was like so sad. Don't apologize for being late. That must be what it sounds like. You know, when, when dudes try to do it too, I'm sure it is. Yes. It's the same thing, right? When you hear a dude with a sleazy cheesy line, you know, and you're like, oh, you feel bad for that check or that could be your sister, that could be your daughter. It's gonna. Listen to this moron. No, I could always just give it to you right here in my car. It's brutal. Oh yeah. Could be someone's kid. That perspective comes from having that perspective. Jacks you. When you have children, everything changes. Porn becomes like a sad story, you know, like, Oh, poor girl getting fucked her. That used to be somebody's baby. Somebody's little girl used to be a thumb now at some big giant Black Dick. Glug, Glug, glug. She's getting gagged, slapped in the face with it and went wow. Can enjoy it. Not so fun. Changed it. Changed the game. Have you been, you've been Brian, have you ever been to set up a porn where a set of a porn?

Speaker 5:          01:03:36       Uh, just like my bedroom and stuff like that. Now it goes. Speaking of which, um, play your friend, your friend's closet. So this is not, speaking of which I mean, you really, this is not a romantic situation for some porn. I filmed no same Tripoli's naughty show. This is a video that I'm and tell everybody they don't have to see it. It's funny enough as it is, but if you want to see it, um, what is the youtube address? Uh, it's just type in a little esther on the street on a little esther on the street. Now what this is, is Brian's French is 20 to 22, but she looks like she's 12. Yeah. Twelve years old. Seriously. She really looks like. And that's her whole thing. And she, she was on Jimmy Kimmel. She played Jimmy Kimmel's, sister, sister on a Jimmy Kimmel and in one episode or so.

Speaker 5:          01:04:26       What is her name? Uh, esther. Esther. Yeah. They, they'll go by little esther. She's hilarious. She's like a new up and coming comic. I would say that she does a lot of comedy store stuff. And Esther. I'm sorry, what's your last name again? She goes by little esther. Little Astro. Yeah. So you can find her. Her name is, uh, is a mystery. Well, if you go on twitter, it's twitter.com, back slash L I l underscore, I'll tweet it in a bit, but uh, yeah, it's called a little effort and here's a. So how do you spell esther? Hold on EST h e r o [inaudible]. I would have got that wrong. So then I would have looked at it the right way and be like, that doesn't look right either. Est He are, they look stupid. All right, whatever. Let's, let's hear this. It's funny, she's on the street, she's a, she's a girl. Literally, he looks

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       like she's 12 years old and she's just walking up to strangers and she's saying that this is for her health class, you know? Yeah. All right. So here it goes.

Speaker 2:          01:05:26       She's got questions. She needs the answers. Interesting. Um, so I'm just asking questions, right? Teen Health Project. What is friends with benefits mean?

Speaker 1:          01:05:38       Oh, it's loading up. It was loaded. Oh, that's so gay. Brian. I can't believe you did that. It was loaded up earlier, but you know, you, we went and did that. Stopped it anyway, blah, blah. Here.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       Say it again.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       They already heard that part, God dammit. Anyway, that's really funny. Yeah, just go to online. We'll play it in the bay or load up while we're waiting. Let it load up. Okay. Anyway, she's 12 and she looks. She looks. She looks like she's 12. It's really funny. Video. Yup. From Sam Tripoli's. Knotty show. And she asked dirty questions. Yeah, a year and another joke. Right. But it's good. It's a good joke. It's very similar to that man show boy concept kind of dirty kid. Looks really young, but tonight, but we're more wrong because it's a girl, but at least it's a really. She's really an adult as opposed to the. Oh boy was a real little kid. Was it? I thought it. I thought it wasn't. I thought, oh no, no, no. I was a kid. It was like he was like 15 or something. It was a boy.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       Right. And he aged while the show was going on. I didn't know that that became the man show, you know, teenagers. I always got that kid mixed up with Andy meant millinocket or whatever his name is. I don't even know who Andy millinocket says I know the name. I've seen the name written in print and it's like a cultural pop icon name. Right. I know someone will say it and I don't know who it is. I don't get it. I've seen it 100 times. Was pretty funny. Any comic? Yeah. Well he's like, like a video guy that he didn't. I don't even know, like a youtube, a youtube, that kind of. But he also has been in like stuff, you know, movies and people don't get offended when you say they don't know who they are and there's just so many, many people to know from MTV.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       I think Korea too much shit going on, man. I can't keep up with those God damn videos. People are sending me. I look at my twitter. It's like if I, if I wanted to just waste my entire life, not waste but use up all my time, I would just go on my twitter and watch all the videos of people send me all these fucked up crazy videos over and over and over and over again all day. Check this out. Oh my God, have you ever seen this? How is this guy still alive? Who Do it everyday? Animal attacks, car wrecks, motorcycle crash animal. All fucking day. Dude. So much content out there. It's impossible to watch it all. You're our minds. You being reprogrammed. You sit in front of these fucking computers. You just inundated with crazy shit over and over again all day. If you have time, if you have time and your Dick Works, someone's going to say to you something fucked up, right? Because if you have time and you're young enough to be having fun in life, you're gonna. Have some fun friends and if you have fun friends, they're going to see some fucked up shit. If they're going to see some fucked up shit, then I want you to see it too. Right? Right. If it tweaks, they're going to want to send

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       it to you. They want to. They're going to want to be the one that shocks you. It's too much, man.

Speaker 6:          01:08:21       It is. It's, you know, every once in a while just reading a book with actual pages, you know, because I got the ipad thing and that. I like that too, you know, but it's sometimes comforting.

Speaker 3:          01:08:31       Go back a page of letters. You've tried this recently and this was a big thing that I do is a sensory deprivation tank. You just tried it for the first time, right? Yep. And what did you, uh, what'd you think about that?

Speaker 6:          01:08:46       I think I sent this to you in an email, but I likened it to the first time I had sex, like I could tell it was something rad and I knew I was going to dig it for the most the rest of my life, but I was terrible at it. Like just not quite good at it yet, you know, you have to really just relax your mind. And I was fidgeting with how comfortable I was, but then I also was super tired when I, when I was in there, you know, it was a long week and I didn't have it, you know, available to me except for you know, kind of late in the evening. And I wanted to make sure I got in so I started to fall asleep, but it was just crazy consciousness and asleep, sleep like I saw this window of where sleep was and I could visually see it, I could see it with my eyes open and I could crawl in it and I was asleep and I could crawl out of it and not be asleep and I was fully in control of, of how it was going and that was pretty.

Speaker 6:          01:09:36       That was pretty wild. I mean what you're able to do with your mind in that situation where you can't tell when your eyes are open and your eyes are closed and there's no feeling, no sensation on your body. The amount of control I was able to exercise was amazing. It didn't find any kind of great lucid information out of it, but the experience was wild. I mean, I've never been able to see those layers because usually you just pass out. You don't know when you fell asleep, all of a sudden you're awake. You remember that. Then all of a sudden you're asleep and you wake up the next morning, but this. I was able to see the steps in between.

Speaker 3:          01:10:08       He never realized how quiet it is until the power goes out in your house. You know when the power goes out in the neighborhood and the power's out everywhere that you hear things go off and is that that dead silence that you don't get any other way while the tank? Is that times a million? Yup. Tank is that with your body? It shuts everything off everything. It's. It's one of the things that I always talk about. I talk about on this podcast all the time. I talk about in interviews all the time and the thing that I'm, oh, I always say is that I'm. I'm always shocked that people don't do this. I'm always shocked that people don't know about this. I'm shocked that there's not one of these on every corner that people aren't having these things put in their house. They have Jacuzzi to put in their house.

Speaker 3:          01:10:48       Why don't you have an isolation tank? Like do you not want to be happy? Do you not want to think? You don't want to relax. People are running like hell from their own thoughts. That's too dangerous. Too much work, man. That's too much work. It's more work to to run for Miss Shit than it is to face your shit, you know, and that there's no face in your shit. Like facing your shit in that tank. Yep. When you can't hide behind any bullshit, when you're in there, you're, you're, there's no distractions, there's nothing you get right immediately to the whatever it was fucking with you. Anything. And then once you get good at that, then you become a I, he become an astral traveler. You get in there and you, you learn how to, how to really let go lock in quick. I couldn't lock.

Speaker 3:          01:11:30       I lock in within 15 minutes, I'm gone. I settle in. I it always. The thing is you always got to get your body to relax. There's so much carrying around and you don't realize how much tension you have in you until you in a zero gravity environment and you realize you're holding yourself. You're like pulling yourself in like your back muscles are pulled in your arms and pulling. You don't even realize you're doing this. You're like fighting the world all the time, but when you get in there and then all that shit goes away. Then about 15 minutes and once the breathing stabilizes and I go that I'm gone. Then I'm often the land of wild hallucinations and fucking vivid dreams and lucid dreaming and flying and uh, communicating with entities and having things explained to you in gigantic three dimensional numbers from an alien planet that are rotating around you and some big hall, a scope that's like, like a, like a hologram that shaped like the planet earth. I was watching the universe being explained to me in letters that were from another planet that we're spinning around that were three dimensional and it was all being orchestrated by these aliens. And it made sense to me while I was watching it. I was trying to figure out their code and their patterns. This is okay. So this is how the whole universe works. It all works. But this one thing. Then everything goes into another thing. And that goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. That's how crazy the ticket.

Speaker 6:          01:12:51       Yep. Why is that? Not Everywhere. Well, I mean there's other ways to get there, right? There ain't no other way to get there unless you're doing drugs. Right, exactly. That's kind of where I was leading to. I mean, but there's. But even those are better in the tank. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:13:05       Mushrooms in the tank or a totally different animal man. There's no distractions. That mushroom gets to talk right to you. You know the weed in the tank, the weeds talking right to you. There's no, oh my ass is on the couch and the light is hitting my eyes and the elbow touches the seat arm. There's none of that. There's no input.

Speaker 6:          01:13:24       There's so many powerful weapons at our disposal that people are so scared of. I mean, it's just crazy. I mean, the tank is one of them, obviously a huge resource and it's easy. It's just, you know, you can't complain about anything. But then there's other shamans for years. I think the best way I've heard it described as as rad book or the cosmic serpent by Jeremy and and he says, the Shamans goal is to lead you to the realm of the spirit, then allow you to defolk focalized. He talks about it like a stereo. Graham, you remember those three d images where you know, you relax your eyes and they, the three d would pop out. He's like, that's what you're doing when you're in that kind of shamanistic experiences, your [inaudible] your body and then allowing communication to come through and hit. But his theories are pretty amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       I mean it's just these conversations are. There's people right now that are listening. Okay. And there's two groups of people that obviously there's more than two, but when it comes to this subject, there's people who've had psychedelic experiences and people who have no fucking idea what we're talking about. Like literally you think we're talking about hippy fairy dust, you know, like this is what it sounds like. You're, wait a minute, what are you doing? You're tuning in to what he had to it in, into what do you. Yeah, you're tuning into Santa Claus, what's going on, right. Like there's like there's even intelligent scientists that we'll have conversations and if you bring up any sort of psychedelic or any sort of psychedelic compound or altered states of consciousness, they just shut off on you. They just immediately discredit everything you're saying. Well, you're just talking about getting high and muscles.

Speaker 3:          01:14:58       Well, you know, nice little box that they can and they toss it away, but if they've done mushrooms, they'll go, oh yeah, they'll look at you and go, yeah, it might be that. Yeah, it might be that I've talked to like some serious, serious fucking scientists, men and guys who have phds and guys who work at universities teaching schools and any teaching physics courses and shit. I've talked to them about psychedelics and add some fascinating conversations where people who are way smarter than me, way more educated than me, way, way more experienced in the ways of the world and they've had a bunch of psychedelic experiences and you know, they'll tell you like, who knows what that is? Yeah. Who the fuck knows what that. That might be a billion different things. This is a pretty cool theory by Jeremy and rob, and I'll give you the cliff notes here, so for discussion sake, but he went down to the Ios garrow Charmaine's down in the jungle and I took the Iowasca with them and he was just an anthropologist just for people who don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       Let's explain what Iowasca is. IOWASCA is two different plants. There's the actual dimethyltryptamine active plant that is part of a vine and then somehow out of the 80,000 species in the Amazon, they figured out things. It's other than that, yeah, there's this other leaf that they needed to combine with it to actually make it work and a Mao inhibitor. So they combine this and they make it into a tea and it's been part of the traditional religious ceremonies down there. Yeah. So what does dmt stuff is is a chemical that it's the most potent psychedelic drug known to man, but it exists in a bunch of different plants, but you can't eat it because when you eat it, it exists in so many different things. I guess your body has some protection for because if you eat grass, grass has dmt in it, well there's a thing that your stomach makes called Mano aiming oxidation. That's Mao. So these guys figured out how to mix an Mao inhibitor that kills the Mao in their system with this dmt so that they can take it orally and you talk to owners when they interviewed the guys and they asked them how they figured this shit out thousands of years ago, by the way, they said the plants, that's how they say about all the medicines that they, the plants. So Jeremy, he took that and he was like, how could this be true? He's like, science discredits it, but they prove it time and

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       time again. They pick the shit that works. And then modern Pharma goes down there and say, Hey, what does this do? And they know the answer. So how do they know the answers? You know? And so the theory is that this all comes from your brain, your brain projects, this stuff when you take dimethyltryptamine. But he has a different theory and his theory goes that, you know, in all of these cultures you see a lot of serpents when you're underneath these visions and these serpents are often intertwined and you can see this written in in rock paintings, in aboriginal Australia and all over the place. The vision of the serpent, he calls it the cosmic serpent is everywhere. And what he's saying is that's actually a vision of person's DNA, of DNA in general, not just the person, but the DNA of life and that you're actually, when you're in that level, you're communicating on a microbiological level with DNA, which is connects everything.

Speaker 6:          01:18:00       It's kind of like the Navi avatar principle where everything is connected by the universal language of DNA and the default realization of the IOWASCA allows you to communicate with the DNA so that the plants talk to you, that there's visions and wisdom from everything that comes and the synthesis is able to get. I mean, there's actually DNA emits and one of the ways you say they communicate is DNA emits actual light. It emits photons. DNA itself will do that. It's too dim and it's too small when you isolate DNA by itself, but it'll emit a certain amount of photons. So you know the, all of these theories that you know, your beings of light and whatever and everything's all. Everything is light. Oh, sounds like you said, like hippie stuff or whatever. But it's cross culturally. People say this. Well when you do Dmt, that's what you see. Two, you see beings that are may not have light. Right? Exactly. And he's saying that's the DNA. The DNA is the substance of life. It's interconnected substance of life. And that's, that's basically the collective unconscious, you know, and that's how all different life

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       I see where you're doing, you're just trying to fuck. And there's always the cynic those steps in. Yeah, that's good. You've got, this is what you got. You've got chemicals interacting with your brain and you'd go loopy for a few hours while your body tries to normalize the poison you've put in your system. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What you are. Okay, it's just another religion, man. You're just believe in some more wacky shit. And all that one ever tells me is that dude hasn't done dmt. That's all it tells me. If you're talking shit about doing DMT, for sure you haven't done it. Because once you do it you go,

Speaker 6:          01:19:34       oh, oh Whoa, whoa. Really, really changes the game.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       And these guys have been doing it for thousands of years and people go, what we'll do through so's book smart man a bit. Have TVS or cars didn't have paved roads. Because if you are doing dmt all the time, you wouldn't give a fuck about tvs. TV Ain't shit compared to being able to communicate with the afterlife. You fuck you. You know what's funny? I can fish. I'll go get a fish. It takes me an hour. I cook, I know I have food, I'm done. I'll go do some more. Tay, right? The ios cares, they call, they call the Iowaska, but the television of the forest, that's what they call it. Like that is, that is where they go to the interesting point. Are there any television? They brought some Iowasca back from, uh, from Brazil. I believe this was in the fifties. And they, when they first recognize it as a psychoactive substance, they were going to call it telepathy because it allowed group think and allowed to let pathy, like they were going to pat it as telepathy, but they didn't realize that the, um, one of the active compounds in it had already been identified and that was harming and because harming had already been identified because of the rules of scientific nomenclature, like the thing they were naming had already been named.

Speaker 3:          01:20:50       So they couldn't call it telepathy, but that's what they were going to call it. They were going to call it telepathy. Been like, Whoa, that's the active ingredient or something that allows you to have telepathy. This is really like, scientists are fucking writing this down. Right? That's nutty shit man. It sounds so woo. Deepak Chopra, yoga beads bullshit. It sounds so fucking dumb to me. It sounds dumb, but I know it's real because I've done it like that's how crazy dmt is. An IOWASCA and mushrooms and all these things that people just automatically label as silly automat. These are life changing reset button pressing motherfuckers. And everybody's like, oh, what are you doing? Mushrooms, man. Here's an honest question. Do you talk about DMT everyday? Is there days that you don't talk about it? Not at all. So amazing that like it's just flooding. Can't talk about anything every day.

Speaker 3:          01:21:38       Man. I Bet I think about it every day. There's always a moment where I'm like in the shower by myself and go, Oh yeah, so you don't think that's kind of crazy that you're not crazy. It's just like if you were picked up by God and take on a magical mystery tour for three hours, the spaceship above fucking Pluto view would be remembering that shit all the time because it was the most extreme experience a human being could ever possibly have felt that like in drugs where I'm like, this is the most amazing thing in the whole entire group, but I don't think. Not like that. You don't like that. It's not. This was the most amazing thing in the world. It's not like that at all. It's this, that this is even possible, is impossible. That this exists is mind blowing, that this reality seems really than the reality that I live in every day.

Speaker 3:          01:22:21       The fact that there's something that feels like it's communicating with you and it's giving you a message that you're connected to everything and that it's a gigantic illusion created by your biology to keep you alive and to make you sustain this other world that exists in your dream consciousness. I mean they, they communicate this shit to you and it makes sense and whatever it is is sees right through you and communicates only with love and is showing you impossible to believe. Images and visuals and at the end of it, when it's all over, you're changed forever. Like you can never get to go back on, go back. You want to, but you couldn't anyway, but you've got to make sure that whatever you get out of that, you can still talk to people. That's another much of anything. Like, I don't want to lose your grip. Yeah, you don't want to get slippery, slippery.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       You could get. If you know, there's a guy that I know that's a tattoo artist that's done dmt like 100 times and um, I, I have hung out with this dude and he did Eddie's arm know Eddie's a sleeve. I don't want to say his name just in case he doesn't want people knowing. Anyway, dude is got this fucking sniper stare. He's got this look in his eyes, man. Like he's just been over there just a few too many times. Like he can't ever quite step back into the real world. Like every corner he turns around, there's fucking DMT. Elves stared at him from behind the counter. Like he's just been there too many times. Man. He's had some very interesting. He doesn't talk about it. That's a weird thing I think when you, when you, when he does talk about it, but he doesn't go into depth like me, like I'm just yapping about it because I haven't done it in years. So it's still fresh in my mind. It, it start off like I'm talking about it a lot and then you start peeing your pants and then we can talk about it. You start seeing it again, like little flashbacks will pop into your head of things that happened, not flashbacks, like you were like you can't see or you're hallucinating, but just like, oh yeah. Oh, okay. That happened. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Just, just. It makes you think about it again.

Speaker 6:          01:24:22       There was one experience that, uh, that I had at the traditional shaman out in, uh, out in the desert here in the US. And she took me out. She took me out a girl Shama yeah, female. She's hardcore and uh, and so with the music start. So, but anyways, I, you know, I fasted for traditional preparation and I drank, drank, drank of substance. I think it was, um, you know, some kind of mushroom and other traditional plant based substance. And that what I got from that has totally changed my life forever. At that point I was able to lift from my body, lift from it, look down and realize, Oh wow, this is just the vessel, you know, it's useful. It's wonderful. It allows me to flow through this world, but it's not the end of. It's not the beal, you know, like there's a separation. There is a distinction between body and spirit and from then the fear of death evaporated for me and it's just. It would just be a shame. Like I certainly don't want to die. I love life. Life is fucking rat, but the fear of it is gone.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       There was just a loose nation, man. You were on mushrooms. You're hanging out with a hot shaman girl trying to get some pussy. You got a little carried up in the moment. You went a little barry manilow. She's just. Just put him on your shoulders, man. He could have been January shoulder. Everything of that. Do you ever. Do you know the book of the, of the book, Sacred Mushroom in the cross? You ever heard that story? I've heard a little bit about John Marco Allegro, who was the one of the head scholars of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He was in charged of deciphering it. Spent 14 years working on the oldest version of the Bible by far and what he decided after 14 years, he wrote a book about it that the entire Christian religion was a gigantic misunderstanding. What it was initially all about was psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals and he said, this is what the whole Christian religion was initially all about and like, you know, has this fucking book dedicated to it.

Speaker 3:          01:26:16       I don't know. I can't follow it. I don't understand, you know, ancient languages. I have no knowledge, but just the fact that this guy was really well respected scholar and it came to these conclusions. I mean, of course they were doing drugs. The drugs were around. Mushrooms have been around for thousands and thousands of years. What were the first ones to figure out? You can eat it. People back then ate everything they could write. They had everything. They had a truck. The reason why we know shit's poisonous is because due to eight it and died and then they said, all right, he ate that. He'd died. Don't eat that. You read that. You try eating that because if this is, there's a lot of this shit around it. This is edible. It's good, it's good. The apples are good. Let's eat the apples. That mean that's how they figured out how to do things.

Speaker 3:          01:26:54       They ate everything, Bro. They it all. They knew what was good, what was bad, and if mushrooms are around and they were people were eating them and if people were eating them, they were seeing God and if they were seeing God, they didn't want anybody else in on the action. So what do they do? They hid all their fucking knowledge about these mushrooms and these rituals and they put it in stories and they put it in fables and parables and they just twisted it all up so it was just a little bit different. Yeah. Fascinating. That's the fucking. The forbidden fruit is a mushroom man. That's what it is. I mean there's, there's an ancient fresco in France, there's this ancient. I'm a painting rather, and it's a on a, on this wall. It's from fucking thousands of years ago and it's Adam and eve with a mushroom tree is Adam and eve with mushroom caps all around them. I mean it is the fucking forbidden fruit

Speaker 6:          01:27:39       and it's been squashed because if you take that, that's a direct link I feel to God, you know, I'm a both a spiritual person in a kind of a deistic believer in the, in the universal God for us. But you take, so you take away mushrooms and then you insert people and people get to absolve you of your sins. It gives them power. You build them giant structures, you know, they get the hat, we'll money power and if you look at the history of the Catholic Church, women as well, especially in the Middle Ages and the renaissance going through there and so they have inserted themselves and then removed the other mechanism to get there directly. So they become the intermediaries at a certain point. I wonder,

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       I mean how much of that is true because there's a lot of speculation about, you know, we're, where they lost the way and what it was really all about. I'm wondering how much they let the common people know about it. Even back then, you know, maybe it was something that, you know, the, the elite found out about it and they tried to protect the information even from the common folk, but also might have been a question of climate change to terence. Mckenna's had some ideas about that and he thought that, um, with the global climate change, which is, you know, very cyclical happens all the time. A lot of times the climate will be inhospitable for mushrooms that changes. So instead of getting mushrooms all the time, now they can't get them anymore. And so then the culture completely changes and becomes more of an alcohol based culture starts off. They start using preserved, uh, mushrooms in honey because we know they've been preserving things in honey for and thousands of years. And then you deal with fermentation because honey can become a psychoactive substance on its own. It could become mead. When it becomes fermented, it becomes like an alcohol. And so then they go into an alcohol culture. And then before you know it, the mushroom ideas are gone all the love. And you know, all the, your fellow man that Shit's out the window and now you know, everyone's just drunk and raping.

Speaker 3:          01:29:25       You know, it's interesting. It's fascinating shit man. What you always got to wonder like how did we get to be who we are now? Like what was it like? Could you imagine if you could go to like 1400 BC and just go hang around England and see what the fuck was going on in France and see how people were living in Europe. You know? How trippy would that be? Man, that'd be crazy. Woo. That would be the strangest fucking thing to be able to go back in time. Even just in like an invisible, impenetrable capsule. Like you could just stand there like in an invisible phone booth in the middle of a town, you know? And you get to watch and they can't walk through the phone booth. It looks like a tree. They can't touch it. You know? I've always,

Speaker 5:          01:30:07       I've been fascinated by that moment before battle, you know, where you know, you just have, you have like an ax or you choose between an ax, a morning star and a sword and you're like, what am I going to use? It's gonna maybe make me survive, you know, like how good is my armor? Not as good as that dude's but I'm a rocket anyways. And like just feel that. I mean mma gets an approximation of that and I think why people love it so much because it's the closest we got, but it pales in comparison to that, you know, to that moment you're with all of the people in your country and perhaps the horde that's coming is going to rape your girl, you know, kill your children, put them into slavery, smash their head on and you got it. You just got to fucking hold the ground, you know, like how is that?

Speaker 5:          01:30:51       We don't even know what that's about. I have no idea. No, and they did that forever. Forever. I mean that was such a part of the human, you know, birthright. But how much of that shit is still in our genes and how do you shut that shit of it? All right. The human hardware is so retro still goes on now like any war, you're doing the same thing. Like what kind of missiles is this guy goes different now. It's totally impersonal. You know? It's so impersonal. Know with the call of duty, it's pretty great. Soldiers were saying just said call of duty. Well two wars are going overseas. What that means like call of duty. That means it's all ground game. That game is pretty much ground game going into or explosions and stuff like that. Still going on for is

Speaker 3:          01:31:35       going on and you know what else is going on? Drones. Drones are allowed to go into places we're not even really at war with. Like in Pakistan, we're not really supposed to be a war in Pakistan, but we got spaceships that are working on remote control from Nevada. They're remote controlling them from Nevada and jacking dudes in Pakistan from the air. It

Speaker 5:          01:31:58       probably have iphone apps with

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       controlling. Just tilt it man. You can destroy that person by just hitting. Do it. It's like that movie. Do you remember that movie where the dude got really good at that video game and then the aliens came and recruited him? Yeah, I remember that Shit. I remember that Shit. Star Star fighter starfighter. Was that it? Starfighter. I just remember because his name was Rogan. His name was Alex Rogan and you know dude, I mean they're doing that with kids that get really good at video games, man.

Speaker 5:          01:32:27       Yeah. Kids get real good at video games. You guys are awesome. Already hasn't been score and then people burst in your dorm. Pneumatics on the army has a video game that's tracked so they can track the top guys. I bet those top guys get knocks on the door of once in a while. Would you like a million dollars? You imagine that you would like to add 80

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       pounds and you're in your underwear. You like, um. I don't like killing things for real. It just make to play your game. Can I go back to playing your game? You put some poor little 13 year old, like flat boat years. You can join us. You can play that game for a living. What do you think? Bell tell anything you want. Take some poor fucking kid. It was just awesome. At the army game. Yeah. It's scary to remove that personal side to killing. I mean it's just a totally different paradigm. When we were talking before the show about these guys that had been caught in Afghanistan that are US soldiers that had been killing civilians and taking home little trophies. They'd been playing like a game just jacking people and killing people. Just they get to use to killing people, man. To, to used to killing people and to use to being in a place where everyone presents you and they don't want you to be there.

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       You know? I always, for the longest time I always would look at, at, at like politicians and go, how much say do they really have? How much state is a president really have and what the fuck is going on over there? Or is he just a dude with a job just like all of us. Is it just all bullshit once you get in there, you know, and I used to look at Bush and when, when Bush was in Iraq and I say, how is this motherfucker responsible for all these people dying? Is he responsible for all this talk about weapons of mass destruction or is he just some dude who's got to do this job? And I remember when he was standing in front of those people and that dude took off his shoes and through madam. Yeah, I remember that Shit. I remember that and he ducked and then to do through it again and he ducked again and he had a little half smile on his face and I'm like, that guy's just a spokesman.

Speaker 3:          01:34:19       Yeah, that's what I got out of that. I looked at that. I'm like, that is just a dude with a very difficult job that's not all that bright and has some ideals and got stuck in this situation and yeah, he's got to say we're going to war, but there's a machine behind that motherfucker. He's not running. Shit I'm looking at is duck in those shoes smiling? I'm like, that guy is not. He doesn't have a care in the world. He's not worrying about what happened in Iraq. He's. He says, no, he's just an employee. Perhaps it's not as responsibility, really, is it? I don't know. I think Alex Jones would have a theory on that. That was my favorite part of the whole Bush administration was in that through through the shoes. It was the first time I liked him. The first time I liked Bush, I would get angry.

Speaker 3:          01:35:01       I'm like, this mother fucker's just bake it a board. It's all bullshit now. I thought about. I'm like, that guy probably gets like four hours sleep a night. What would I be saying if I was speaking all these people, I'd be making up words too. I'd be stumbling. I'd fuck my words up at it. Everybody fucks up. You know. Obama said something about there being 48 states. I mean, he fucked up the states when he was running. You know, people fuckings up all the time. You're not thinking you're tired all the time. You're on this campaign trail. They don't. He's not running shit. I learned like Bush. No, I mean I think he's probably right. It's probably not a bad guy. Okay. Everybody's like use the gym and he's double. I bet they believe that you're really a president until they get in there. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:35:40       I think once you get in there, you, they open up these doors and you get to see the gears of the universe run. You get to see the gears of our whole system and the fucking. Well, if we stopped the war, we don't have the oil and we needed to do in society is going to fall apart and we're getting to a point of overpopulation. That's why you need to feed them in camps and we have to make sure that if something goes down, we have enough caskets and whoa now about you cutting taxes. Oh fuck. All that. Fuck all that. Fuck all that. Exactly. We don't need some money, dude. We're going to need some money or some shit going on. We've got to come up with an alternative fuel. We have exactly two years worth of fuel left and then people start eating people.

Speaker 3:          01:36:13       Okay, what the fuck happens when you get in there, man? Yeah. I was a big, big support. I was a big Obama Fan. I thought, you know, maybe I don't. I'm not. I'm a libertarian so I'm not Republican or Democrat, but I thought this dude is smart. He can hoop. He's got a good family. It looks like he'll get in there and play a little basketball. Hey, you say that I, I appreciate it. I saw him play pool. They'll go, this guy's got gotta look, Bama can get out. You mean for balls on the table? Obama might get out on man played halo. Reach with him. He's a regular dude. That's what I want. I don't want something fucking child blood sucking dragon like Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney can't play pool. He's too busy killing people. You think Dick Cheney everland had to play basketball. No, he's heart explodes when he tries to tie his shoes at 150 heart attacks, you know he ain't playing shit with you and he's got no sense of humor.

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       You know, I, I could recognize him and relate to him more than anyone that has ever been president before. I was like, well, here's a guy who was only a few years older than me, and he seems like a normal dude. You know, like Kanye West. He calls him a jackass and like, yeah, fuck yeah, this is his wife. It's like, oh yeah. He kissed his wife. That bullshit. Quail. That was carrie. Oh, all of them. All of them. My favorite swarmy Douche bag busted you. You fucking fake all of them, man. It's like you can't. It's like, it's impossible to be honest. It's impossible to do it. They won't let you get in. You got to be full of shit to get in. I thought Obama was the first guy that wasn't full of Shit. I was like, what is. He seems like soda can take a chance with.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       I was, I was backing. I think you can do anything. I think you get in. It's just a stalemated yeah. You get in. It's just like, well fuck you. No lobbyists and fucking congress and this and that and layers and red tape and chaos and war, and then they just tell her when heroin, heroin, heroin coming in by the fucking boatload. What's the heroin doing? It's just slightly. Afghans need to make a profit. Otherwise support this war. You know? We were talking about that on the Alex Jones show. We were talking about that before the show that there was a Geraldo Rivera was in Afghanistan talking to this fucking soldier, this guy who has a family who is supposed to be defending his country and meanwhile where is he? He's in the poppy fields protecting the poppy fields for the afghany farmers because in order for the Afghan farmers to support the fact that we're over in Afghanistan dropping bombs on your moms, we have to get this guy's approval and we have to allow them to keep producing their illegal crop of heroin. So we have American soldiers that are guarding Afghanistan heroin so that we can go over there and blow shit up.

Speaker 3:          01:39:05       God Damn. What do you do if your Obama, what do you do? Fuck. You get into how you gonna fix that. It's tough, but as you know, I think they figured out that his approval ratings were dropping as the economy was tightening up and so they're like, ah, fuck it. Let's just put some more money on the system, push the ball up, and then it's working. If I thought that heroin was helping the economy, I would say so that heroin, who the fuck is buying heroin retards? You know, why is oil still like in, at least in California? Most states right now, still cheap. Cheaper than it was like five years ago. And you know what you mean? When Bush was leaving office then they had a fucking a grab, but don't you say, why don't you think it should be like ridiculously high, especially after that spill and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       Well, did you just realize or just here rather, they underestimated Iraqis oil reserve by 25 percent. There's 25 percent more oil in Iraq and they thought there was a. oh Shit, oh shit, I'm gonna. Get that quote that son fuck a Va. You know, listen man, who the fuck knows? I think it was, I think they just jacked up all the prices that they can pay for new plaza on top of the all the fucking oil. You got to be gotten to like the gas station. There's like nice plasma tvs and everything like that and like how does, where does this come from? Oh yeah, $5 a gallon last last year. You know, I'm, I'm wondering who actually, how that works. I think. I think actually how it works is the. I mean they're all in bed together obviously, but I believe it's the distributors that set the price and then these oil companies, like there's a place up the street, it's owned by these hindus that I go to and they have like the ohm on the door. I'm like, this is the oddest place ever. They sell weed pipes. They're there. So we pipes and incense at the counter. Like this is the oddest place ever. Like you guys sell petrochemicals. You sell, you know the real problem, the reason why we're in war, that you know the reason why we pollute and it's all coming out of this hole right here. And then you get the oam at the door. So I don't think it's them setting the price of the plasmas. I think it's the companies that sell it to them,

Speaker 5:          01:41:07       you know, it's all for free market speculation, handles a lot of that. I mean, when oil price was dropping there as big deflationary pressures, at the same time, gold prices were dropping, things were priced because nobody had any money. The speculators weren't able to buy the gold, they were pulling their assets back out into cash, et cetera. But now things are a little bit looser and these commodities have value. They're more worried about inflation now because obama's push it, you know, just shoving money into the system. So in an inflationary time then these commodities have value. So now we're seeing oil rising. We're seeing gold bush.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       I would, there was one big jump where it went up to like five bucks a gallon. What was the cause of that?

Speaker 5:          01:41:43       I, you know, I think at that point it was the massive inflationary concern, you know, that there was, that money was goIng to lose its value and that caused the oil to go up in price at the. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41:54       When it, when it goes up a barrel, does anybody know? You don't know either. Do you? Brian has no idea.

Speaker 5:          01:41:59       Yeah, it's fine. I'll tell you. It's dangerous. It's ninja set the price in Japan on friendly dolphins and there's certain, there's certain supply and demand factors involved in the oil but as well specifically, but on a macro level, I mean it's all about generally inflation.

Speaker 3:          01:42:15       It just seemed very suspicious to me that it was the end of the bush administration and administration that was clearly under the influence of big oil and then at the very end of the administration, everything just gets

Speaker 5:          01:42:26       delta twist to pay his tab. You know? It was true, it was true red line.

Speaker 3:          01:42:31       They were going to red line as much money out of the system as they could until the new administration came into play on how much, how much control does the president or the administration really have and how that kind of stuff works. Do they have any at all? It's all gotta be set up. There's no way they're going let some new dude come in every four years and just rerun shit like why would we do that? We know the career guys, the very top of the heap. They've already. We got this. We got no.

Speaker 5:          01:42:57       Well opec supposedly sets how much the available reserves there are and kind of does that, but how much is it? You know, all of that is speculation now who knows how much they know and what they're doing, but it's. It's an interesting game with a lot of money at stake when you have that much money at stake, you could be buck sure that people are trying to figure out a way to fuck it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:15       You know? It's pretty amazing what it's done now because if it wasn't for oil, there would be no plastic. There'd be no computers, it'd be no nothing. You know, all the shit that we make today. No flashlights, no flashlights. Especially flashlight is actually made out of oil. This shit has to come out of the ground as oil before you can fuck it.

Speaker 5:          01:43:33       Yeah. Mostly mineral oil, food grade, mineral, a primary component

Speaker 3:          01:43:38       and food grade mineral oil comes out of the ground, right? Just like, just like, well

Speaker 5:          01:43:42       why? Where does it mean? Doesn't it all come from? Yeah. I think it actually might come from it. Probably know

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       that doesn't come from fish. Can you make a flashlight? That official. Al will be nasty. That would be more realistic. Dirty fucking deep flashlight. Maybe some dudes just missed stinky pussy. All the only time they got laid as by slots and just drunk pigs and that's what gives me a hard on. There's a good mood.

Speaker 5:          01:44:13       There's a product that came out actually called the vulva and what they've done, they sell it for 40 bucks, gagging already 40 bucks and it's like a little perfume vial that supposedly smells like pussy. So obviously being in the business that we ordered some fast around a smell and it doesn't quite get there, but what it kind of smells like is like a cat. No, no, it's way closer to that. It's like post condoms, sweaty sex, sweat and rubber has like this. Like this.

Speaker 3:          01:44:54       Oh, why would anybody want to sell stinky pussy smell? I dunno. We used to send ours with, with like knife to spread on your vanilla scent. But now all flashlights come on. So I always wonder how much fart porn is just for show how much of dudes who are mostly definitely girls who were foreign and dudes miles and they're beating off and shit. What, what is that? Is that for show or is that just fire porn really over the deep end. What is that? What is that?

Speaker 5:          01:45:21       Uh, you know, I, I think with all these fetishes out there likes it for sure. At least familiar for sure. He's one guy out there, loves every, you know what I think it is. I think all of these fetishes, whether their feet or whether it's shit, I think someone's mommy was like, that's disgusting. Don't you ever fart like bottle and they just hammer them with this repression and this repression gets all twisted up and then all of a sudden all they want to do to get a boner is barred on somebody because they've been told by their mothers so many times. Parting is disgusting. Don't ever fart. And I think the same with feet, like hide your dirty feet, you're dirty feet day, they think blah blah blah and like really like kind of victorian, you know, parents are doing. Then all of a sudden all they want to do is see someone getting jerked off by girls feet. So what's your I, you know, I don't have one really bright girl. I don't know. My beautiful girlfriend friend.

Speaker 3:          01:46:07       Yeah. What's your spine? I have a lot of fetishes. Really? Yeah, totally. Definitely boobs. That's not a. So it's called being a dude now. Every guys in the boobs, I'm not really. No, you don't remember, but my mom really a bug guy, but it's definitely more. I appreciate, I appreciate what they do to the feminine form. Like I can aesthetically value them, but as a sexual object very low on the list. Yeah, I agree. Well, I don't say they're low on the list, but they do not compare it to the ass. This is critical. It's very important that trigger girl can have a tremendous ass and really be like an a cop and she's hot as fuck. You know? It doesn't matter. You look at the ash like, god damn. Yeah, but girl with big tits

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       and a really flat ass. It's just like if the bud had nipples, I would agree. If the fns had nipples, I would agree. Could you imagine though, if an asset, if that'd be the nipples, you would agree that you don't want to fly one. No, I'm just saying for fed is, is if you combined boob and asked, that would be like the best. Do a mashup. Yeah. I want to finish refinish mashup. The remix. It.
