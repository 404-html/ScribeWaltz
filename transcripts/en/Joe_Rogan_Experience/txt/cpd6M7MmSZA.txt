Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, freak bitches. Yeah. I'm going to quote Sinbad. Say that you got. I love the. I love this quote. He goes, he's a very nice guy. He was great. He did my podcast. Tony Hands Club says he's awesome. Talk about leaving your body. Astral projection. Same bad. Does it? He asked truly projects, astral project. How's he do that? He stopped doing well. There's all these techniques. There's there's books and stuff about it. The long and the short is you get into a trance and you imagine a rope above you. Then pull yourself down or what he did actually remember, he was like, I put something just out of my reach and then you're trying, as you're laying there with your eyes closed, kind of meditating, you're trying to reach the thing, and then he said he felt his hand wrapped around and that's how he knew he had left his body and he did it for months and months and months and months, and then one day he said he was like in this weird place.

Speaker 1:          00:47          It was in the cave. Some shadow creature came up and hit him in the chest. I know this is sinbad, remember, and he goes and it felt like someone had cracked me in the chest with a sledge hammer and he was like, I never did it again. Whoa. And I was like, really? You got to go back, try and find like booby island or something. He's right though. Maybe he's ready to be snatched up by the demons in stranger things. It is next dimension demon that lives in the wall. It is scary if you read a journey's out of the body are far. Journey is a Robert Monroe in the fifties. It's like you read this book and he still calls black people negros and stuff like you can tell it's an old old book, but he's telling that's how old this stuff is. It's because way back he would tell stories about like seeing something fly by and being very concerned that that thing was trying to get into his body before he did.

Speaker 1:          01:31          So it's kind of a scary thing, but it's one of those things. So I was under the impression that people did die when most people are under that impression. I've, I've had, I've spoken, given talks at medical schools and stuff and all these doctors think that everyone died at 35 or 35 year old results and they're like, and it works its way into medicine where they're like, okay, look, the reason you have chronic back pain is that the human body was not evolved to live beyond 35, and so of course you have wear and tear and things like that's totally false. The human bodies evolved to live into the seventies, so it's a statistical thing. It's like if Bill Gates moves into your neighborhood, suddenly everyone's average annual salary is hundreds of millions of dollars, right? So if you count all these infants who died in prehistory, many of whom by the way died from infanticide, like twins normally are not allowed to survive.

Speaker 1:          02:23          The, the weaker one is left in the woods to die. What? Yeah, and any sort of deform and mal formality, we just leave them in the woods by themselves. What a cruel way to handle it. Yeah. Whew. That's dark man. They would leave him to wolves. That's fucked up, man. Leave your baby in a basket and runaway. Ooh, yeah. There's a lot of, a lot of infanticide, but you know, in our world, a lot of it, huh? Yeah. Well, just because the times were harder than. And it was more accepted that you were going to have to do some terrible things that you didn't want to do. Well, it's just that, you know, if a kid's born physically fucked up in some way, you know, you're not gonna, you're not gonna have the resources and that kid's not going to. The person's not going to grow up to contribute to the group.

Speaker 1:          03:09          And so generally, and also there's a different sense of life and death, right? You know, I think we're death is much more a daily presence. It's not that big a deal. So we're all gonna die there. I was reading about a tribe in the Amazon. Uh, I can't remember the name of the tribe, but when someone gets too old to keep up with the group, someone is chosen randomly, like they have a lottery or pick the shortest straw or whatever it is. And their job is to come up behind this old person and hit him in the back of the head with a hatchet. Oh boy. Right. And no one wants to do it. It really sucks, but everyone agrees it has to be done. And it's the least cruel option that they've come up. Be careful to do to keep signing up for that job.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Exactly. Got Papa Joe. You've killed nine old ladies. This lady. This bitches gone over. Okay. We'll just let her stop. It's weird, man. It's a weird gig. Kenton's wife tends to look at me like that is the source of looseness right there. That's single man with a mustache. This man got cut loose to spend too much time with him. It could all go down a feral. Yeah. What's why. Like no one tells Ryan were to go. Ryan can just go into the woods anytime he wants. I don't think that's right. Yeah. What about d? Doesn't have a leash on how many times did he call and check in, but I was just out there with no leash collar. I get a long leash. I get along, especially during hunting season, but mark might have a leash. Brian doesn't have a leash. He just asked him. He doesn't have to call anybody.

Speaker 1:          04:53          He just goes where he wants it. It is what it is. Joe, if he just decides to take that mustache and go for a hike, nobody can tell him that. That, that pisses women off because then when demand goes, yeah, Hey, Ryan says out there with no leash, just do whatever he wants. I wish I was like that. Like I love being married. I love having kids. I loved the whole deal. I love having a family, but I got a buddy, my friend Ari. You know what he did? He just went off the grid, shut his fucking phone off. He won't answer his emails. He just disappeared. He went to Pacific for so long. I just want to do it for a few months. He's just. He's a standup comic. Hilarious guy. Successful show on comedy central is doing great. Kicking ass. He just decided, you know what? I need some experiences in my life to write about, to talk about, so I'm just going to fucking stop talking to people and disappear for a few months ago. I talked to him in two months. I haven't talked to him. I don't know where the fuck is. You call his voicemail. It just says the subscriber. You have reached to shut off incoming call or I'll play it for you. That's amazing dude. This thing is just the most devious creation on it is it is

Speaker 2:          05:59          subscribers request. This phone does not accept incoming calls. Message in V one.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Gotcha. Phares. Rockin message [inaudible]. You don't give a fuck straight in the eye. So if my wife heard that, well he's out there. You think that's good? He's got no one to call in to check in, but he can check in and do whatever he wants, but he wouldn't call and say everything. Cool. Yeah. How late she can call me up. Hey faggot. I'm still alive and then hang up the phone. That's it. I'm like, God damn the to checkout and we can. I mean, where we are, it is narrow valley public land everywhere. As soon as you get off the valley floor, you're on public land like we talked about. I can hate. I can hate to the fricking Yukon, man. That's crazy and you can be disconnected, as disconnected as you want to be, and man, there is no price tag on that. That's the thing and I need it.
