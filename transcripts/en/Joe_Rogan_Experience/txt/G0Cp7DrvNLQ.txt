Speaker 1:          00:00:01       It makes it look like we're on a radio show. Yeah. The Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Joe Rogan podcast by night.

Speaker 1:          00:00:16       Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. Randall Carlson. How are you, sir? I'm doing well. Joe, you freaked out the entire podcast population the last time you were here with your stories of cataclysmic disasters and, and, uh, the, uh, ramifications of asteroidal impacts and just the, just the, the evidence that you presented was a real mindfuck as it were. Well, uh, what can I say? I apologize to all the listeners out there that might have had nightmares. No worries. I knew that was going to be the case though. I knew after the first time I met you, we had that long conversation in Atlanta. I knew once you sat down for three hours on a podcast and open up about that stuff, it was really going to uncork a lot of people's domes. Well, you know, ironically there's an upside to the whole thing. Maybe we'll have time to get into that a little bit today.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       Yeah, definitely. So tell me, you just returned from a long excursion with Graham Hancock if you want to bend that thing like that towards your face or probably work a little. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, there you go. You just returned from a long excursion with Graham Hancock. You guys were on the road. And what was the nature of your trip? Where we were. I was taking Graham on a tour showing them some landscapes. Um, we were, I could haul them to the landscapes of catastrophe because he's doing his secret two fingerprints of the gods. And you know, when he came out with that book in 1995, he was theorizing that there had been this lost civilization in prehistoric times and you know, the critics, the gist of most of what the critics were attacking him on and there were considerable attacks on him as a result of some of the things he put forward in that book was that, well, if there was this great civilization that had existed in, you know, somewhere back in prehistory.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Where's the evidence of it? Where, where is the worst of pottery? You know, where are the carvings were, where is the infrastructure that would have existed and you know, I don't know if he really had an answer for that other than the fact that there had been a cataclysmic events that had intervened between then and now, but he wasn't really specific about what the nature of those catastrophes actually, we're in a lot of additional research has come out since 1995. That basically opens the window onto those events that basically separates our modern history, which, you know, the recorded history goes back five or 6,000 years. You, when we look at

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       the emergence of modern civilization, we would basically trace it back to nine or 10,000 years ago with the emergence of, of um, uh, you know, agriculture, a dispersion of languages, the first cities and so forth. When we go beyond that a few thousand years, we're in a completely different world and I mean, so completely different that it's almost unrecognizable from our modern world. If we started recreating maps, a going backwards, like taking snapshots of the planet every millennium, going back, what we would see is that going back to seven or 8,000 years ago with the basic configuration of our planet would not change much. Once we get 11, 12, 13,000 years ago, the change has become profoundly dramatic. We start seeing sea levels going down hundreds of feet. We see massive ice sheets covering North America and Europe and and lots of other enormous changes. Beyond that is what I considered to be deep history because as we may have talked about in our last interview, you know, we modern humans have been on this planet for a 150 to 200,000 years.

Speaker 3:          00:04:13       At least. You know, if we go back, say I think the oldest modern human skeleton ever found was named Homo adult too, and he dates to about 180,000 years roughly if we think of a generation of humans is 25 years. That's 7,000 generations of humans now. So the question is, what were we doing for all those thousands of generations until somebody finally realized, Hey, you know what, we can plant crops, we can, you know, we can build cities, we can form communities, you know, we can invent language, etc. Etc. WEll, my contention is, and I think the evidence that's accumulating supports this interpretation at what we're really seeing seven, eight, 9,000 years ago, is not the origins of civilization, but the rebooting of civilization. You see what I'm saying? And when we go back and we realize that modern history is separated from deep history by this extraordinary series of events that transpired between about 11 and 13 or 14,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:05:27       Once We begin to recognize how extreme these these events were in remodeling our planet, totally remodeling our planet, it then becomes obvious to us why there is not a lot of hard evidence for whatever went on prior to these, to these events. And there's been some things that they found since then that have really sort of made graham hancock's theories become more and more palatable to even mainstream scientists like go tap. Exactly, exactly. Go back a good ang pedang. These are apparently a structures that were buIlt at least 11 or 12,000 years ago. And I'm waiting to find out the, um, the most recent ideas on him. I think that probably they go back much older than that because from what graham told me, they're just only in the preliminary stages of being excavated. So I believe rebecca tempe is less than 10 percent excavated, right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       Yeah. Yeah. So this is this enormous ruined that appears to be late pleistocene ice age in an age that apparently was deliberately buried. Um, which is interesting. Brings up a very interesting issue. Why would they deliberately buried and they noticed delivery deliberately buried because of the uniformity of the age of the dirt. Is that when I questioned him on that, because I wanted to know if it was because the first thing I thought to myself was it could be natural because I have seen so many sedimentary deposits caused by great floods. Graham assured me that that was, that it was human. It was deliberate. It was not. Because if it had been buried by floods, your water, there should be internal stratification. That would be very obvious. I've been giving it some thought and, and you know, what occurred to me was this and, and I ran this by grand, but I haven't gotten a response from them on this, but I started thinking if it was deliberately buried, why would they bury it?

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       Then I began thinking what we talked about last time when we were talking about the tin guscott vanity in siberia when you had this massive aerial detonation, you know, that was about a 15 megaton explosion. Okay. Now that's equivalent to our biggest hydrogen bombs that used to be in the american arsenal and it's just because of an asteroid that, that blew up in our atmosphere, but a 150 foot diameter asteroid, which is not that big really relative into cosmic scale of things. The point though is that it was moving really, really fast. You know, is moving, you know, a rifle bullet, let's say on average it's about a thousand feet per second. Write a, an asteroid coming into the atmosphere is going to be 20 or 30 times that velocity, so it carries an enormous kinetic punch. when it hits the atmosphere, it explodes because of the fact that the earth is not actually absorbing a lot of that energy. It's dispersed widely through the atmosphere. Now, think about this particularly during the height of the cold war, in order to protect our missile silos are super hard and command and control centers. What did we do with them? Put them on the ground, put them under ground. We buried him. Exactly, and that began. I began to think perhaps could could explain why it was buried in order to preserve it against the possibility of, of some kind of an aerial burst or or you know, some kind of a,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       a highly energetic event. That seems a weird thing for 12,000 years ago. No, I mean, what? What do we have really no evidence whatsoever that anybody's capable of doing anything like that that long ago, but it was. I think on the contrary, I think that what we see at the very beginnings of recorded history, it's an obsession with the sky, you know, and that's one of the points that graham brings out in his work, you know, is that that humans, our ancestors, have 10, 12, 13,000, or even much sooner than that ad had a, um, just an obsessive concern where the vents in the sky and you know, all of these ancient structures, whether we're talking about stonehenge and I'm sure it's going to be the same case with go beckley, tappy, when we look at these, these, this infrastructure from the messel ethic period through the neolithic period from six, five, 4,000 years ago, 300 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       What we see is that there's this concern with astronomy. You know, you see the astronomical alignments that are built into these structures actually allow some pretty sophisticated, uh, observations of, of events happening in the sky. And we can maybe pull up some stuff here that I've brought today to look at. But, um, yeah, I think that it's highly plausible that people back then could have. Because think about this again, to try to put this in context. How many generations ago was the primary mode of human transportation? Horseback, not that many, four or five generations, and pretty crazy, pretty crazy. Now think 7,000 generations. Are you going to tell me then and all of that trance, all of that time, all of those generations of humans that have the same presumably intelligences our own because they've got the same brain size, um, that they're not going to be able to come up with some kind of a, uh, a transmitted tradition, some type of, of, um, you know, the idea of somehow of culture, of civilization, of language, of, uh, you know, that's my point is that there was so much that has been lost.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       And once we understand how dynamic this planet really is, it'll become clear to us why we don't have the hard physical record of things going on 20 or 30,000 years ago. To put it in perspective for people who have never studied ancient Egypt. Cleopatra, the pyramids of you. If you look at the date of the pyramids, that cleopatra is closer to us. Yes, than the pyramids were to clear path, which is nuts. It's crazy. Stop and think about that. Like, wait a minute, what was that old back then? And they have found these little tiny airplanes inside the pyramids, these little, little, miniature, you know, carved airplanes that looked like airplanes. If someone's people have tried to saY, well no, they represent birds. That doesn't look like a burden at all. I mean they have a rudder and they look like planes. Well yeah. And, and you know, there are tradItions, particularly the vedic traditions that are full of descriptions of flying off.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       Yes. The vimanas yeah, exactly. So what is that, you know, I'm not going to proclaim unequivocally it's, it's, it's airplanes, but at the same time we got to keep an open mind about it. And the point I'm trying to make is that yeah, there was so much time to transpired. All kinds of things could have happened that have basically been erased. Right? And, and hopefully by the end of today's interview you'll have a better, clearer idea of specifically what some of those things really were. So we're talking about a potential civilization of maybe tens of thousands of years of growth and if we're looking at what we're, what we have from the beginning of the dawn of civilization that we believed mesopotamia somewhere around 70,000 years ago from that till today, we're talking about maybe double or triple that was lost and these gigantic cataclysmic events may be 15, 20,000, 30,000 years of of human beings inventing things, people building upon the inventions of others expanding and then all of that wiped out.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       We're rubbing sticks together again to start fires and then whatever memories are left, people have to rebuild a generation or two ago. It was easy to dismiss. Ideas like that is fringe science. Today as we sit here in 2015, it's not nearly so easy to dismiss that anymore. Particularly what we now know about the history of this planet that are truly dynamic. It is bad and that we have in effect been sort of blessed the last six to 10,000 years were they relatively stable climate. And I'm going to show you some graphs here that really will blow your mind, that really will, will, will underscore how significant some of these changes have been, how profound some of them have been. And once we, once we know that, begin to incorporate that into our thinking, we realize we're going to have to kind of reevaluate our models of, of prehistory.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       Okay. Well we have a new setup now. So with the tricaster, we're gonna allow randall to take control of the situation here. If you're just listening to this, this might be one of those podcasts where if you're one of those people that listens to it on a commute, you might want to go back and check out the, uh, well, vimeo or youtube or those are the ones that use stream is going to give you a hd now too, right? We do. Some people don't even know we do a hd video of this podcast as well. So what is this oxygen isotopes in greenland? oxygen isotopes in greenland. Yeah. What we're looking at here, this goes back to the early nineties when glaciologists and paleo climatologist guys should study ancient climate extracted these ice cores from the summit of greenland, and the reason they went to the summit was because they were looking for the most undistorted ice core records that they could find. previous ice core extractions had been near the perimeter of the, of the ice sheets in there. The ice flow is much more dynamic, so there was more distortion. Your record. So what

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       they did was they went to the very center of. There was a european team and an american team, and without getting into the, into the background, basically the ice sheet there was almost two miles thick. It took them five years to drill through. It was miles thick. Yes. Yet just think about how far like looking how far two miles away. It's like, what is a plane? A plane is a mile in the air. No, no. Well, uh, is going to be about 30,000 feet. What's the mile? Thirty 5,000 feet a mile. Now human gut. Remember this, because it's going to be at number 5,280 feet is a mile is a mile right now the tallest building in downtown la is probably not over 800 feet. Three hundred feet at the most. No. Um, I'm not sure I did look it up at one point. What the tallest building was. I don't remember what, what it was.

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       I know the tallest building in atlanta is a thousand and 60 feet and um, you know, two miles, you'd have to think of 10 of those stacked on top of each other to get a two mile thick sheet of ice. That's, that's an amazingly huge, massive ice. right? And, and, and that's pretty much the summit of greenland. right? And what we're looking at on this, on this graph here, if you, if you go down the left side of the graph, this is the surface. And then down here there's 1500. You see right at the bottom, that's 1500 meters, right? Fifteen hundred meters. You figure there's about three point two, eight feet per meter. So that's going to be 45. It's gonna be close to 5,000. So this is, this is 1500 meters. Tufts aaliyah mile, yeah, a little less than a mile over here on the right is, is the time in thousands of years before the present.

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       So you go down right there, there's a thousand years, you go down, there's 2000 down at the bottom you see 10. So that's 10,000 years ago. Now basically what the oxygen isotopes through there are a proxy for temperature change adjacent to the ice mass. Right? And if you look at these, these are snapshots basically taken like every 10 years. Right? And once you see here is that the, is the temperature is oscillating back and forth, back and forth. It's a two to four degrees centigrade. Now to put this into context, the concern, you know, we, we got into this somewhat last time to hold issue of global warming and, and I know that in some of the feedback we got some of the most critical comments came from people who didn't like me undermining this whole concept of global warming induced catastrophe, right? What we see here though is was clearly that the, that the climate, this is the 10,000 years that we're talking about here, it's called the holocene by geologists. It's oscillating back and forth, two to four degrees centigrade every, every 10, 20, 30 years. Right? So we're, we're talking about a degree that has changed basically in the last century to the century and a half, right? Which, which really almost wouldn't even show up here. You see, but we're going down as we go down, we'll see if you go to the right. That means temperature's warming. Did you go to the left?

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       It means it's cooling, right? And so as we go back down, this is through the holocene. We're going through here and if you look, there's some interesting stuff going on right here at about 8,000, 200 years ago. There's a really, there's a spike Of cooling right there. And that was very, very significant cooling. I mean that was probably a, caused the glaciers worldwide to start growing again for short, for a couple of centuries after they had basically disappeared at the end of the ice age. So this was a very significant event right here, and then as we get down right here at 10,000, you see it starts deviating to the left, it starts deviating to the cooler. I'm going to go to the next slide. Where do we take this graph and we turn it on its side. And what I've done here is you see this is, this is the present right here and this is basically 10,000 years ago over here on the right side and, and I've drawn a level.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       There's a level green line in here to kind of give you a comparison and you'll notice something. Here's this 8,000, 200 year ago cold spike, right? And then as we're going along here, you'll notice something that the general amplitude of these oscillations starts increasing as we get closer to the present. Can you see that? Yeah, it gets better. And you'll also notice that it's dropping, it's dropping below that green line and that means it's cooling. So in the last 10,000 years, we went from a period of considerable warmth in the immediate post glacial era. And then it began to cool off around 6,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago, and I said, begin to cool off the temperature. Oscillations began to increase in magnitude. Okay? Which actually contradicts the computer models that are saying the amplitude of the oscillations is going to increase as the climate gets warmer.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       What we actually see from the greenland ice cores is the opposite of that. And it's right here in this graph. But what's really significant about this is when we go back beyond 10,000 years ago, whoa. And we see this jesus christ. Yeah. For folks who listening, there's a giant change. I mean, we're looking at a little tiny, you know, maybe millimeter left, right? Left, right, left, right up until this point. Now we're looking at huge changes. Huge changes. Wow. Catastrophic changes of temperature. Yeah. And, and here we're going back. This is notice, this is between a 11 right here, roughly 11,600 years ago. And about 14,000 years ago. Look at what happened right here. You can see right around 15,000 years ago, the climate is is actually if we took this thing out of here, you can see there's almost a a trend upwards that gets interrupted right here. Boom, instantly, boom, overnight jump overnight. Overnight. Yeah, and in fact, what has happened is if you go back through the literature of of climate change and you read the, the estimates, how long

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       it took for the planet to shift modes from full glacial to the interglacial like we're now 50, 75 years ago, it was a thousand or more years, thousands of years. When radiocarbon dating came along in the fifties, it began to compress and what happened is that if you look in the eighties, they're talking about perhaps a century, several centuries now comes the greenland ice cores and other ice cores and other proxies, deep sea corps and so forth, and the correlation of all of this evidence and it goes from centuries, two decades. Well, as the ability to perceive these changes through with ever greater precision and ever greater resolution has evolved. It's gotten to now where the change, the climate change that took us from glacial interglacial happened in less than five years and that's what we're seeing right here in this graph. That's what we're seeing. So 2010 glacier, 2015 done ice age over the glacier.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       Yeah. Bear in mind now that there was a considerable lag between the actual, the, the manifestation of the glaciers because the glaciers didn't melt that quick because they're so huge. Imagine it. We had a big chunk of ice. We had an ice sculpture here. Right? And if the temperature is 31 degrees, it's not going to melt. If you turn the temperature up to 70 degrees, right? We could turn the temperature up in the matter and he could warm up the room in a matter of hours or minutes. But it's gonna take a while for that ice sculpture to melt. There's going to be a lag, right? Although the change that led to that meltdown was virtually instantaneous. You see so, but in that, in that period, and it's the interim, what we're seeing right here, there was an extraordinary right here. I think if I go to the next slide, I think you know, let's go to the next one.

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       Yeah. I'm going to zoom in here so you can see this. There were two massive warming spikes. One right here, you can see that we're down here in full glacial mode right there. And then boom, right there. There's huge spike of, of warming. Now what does that represent when it comes to like temperatures? Uh, that could be on the order of. Well, that would be about 10 to 12 degrees centigrade, which would be about 18 degrees fahrenheit. Average temperature, which is a crazy, crazy, crazy change because they're scared of two degrees, right? Scared of two degrees. And here we're looking, we're scared to tutorees centigrade here. We're looking at five, six times that much in a matter of a couple of years. You'll see at this point, we don't really have an explanation for this. That's why I get really frustrated when somebody says to me, oh, the debate on climate change is over.

Speaker 3:          00:23:36       No, no, no, we're, we're, we're, we're in the infancy of understanding the climate of this planet. And when we look at stuff like this, you see, um, it really drives home that point. And you can see here, right here people, people are saying when they're saying that the debate on climate change is over though, is whether or not human beings have had an impact on it in current times. No question. We have had an impact. No question of what the debate is. Right? Well, if you say that the debate is about have humans had an impact or not, I think that there is no debate. Yeah. Humans have had an impact. What they're looking at though in your mind is one aspect of a very multidimensional issue. Yes. Yes, exactly, exactly. And, and my, my concern is, is that we're going to get so focused on carbon chains and carbon chains that we're not looking at any of these other factors.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       Isn't that what people do though? We concentrate on one aspect of things and it becomes like almost like a cultural meme and that it spreads. And this is all people talk about. It had been so many people. I guarantee you that we're upset at what you said have not researched climate change at all. They just have parroted the words of people that they've heard on television that are experts. Well, you got this. Well, 97 percent agree. Well, if you look into the origin of that, it's pretty contrived. It really is. I mean, how you come up with that and, and we could do an hour long discussion on dan. I don't really think we want to get into that today, but I, I really feel like I should write an analysis of that. The source of that 97 percent so called consensus so that people can really see where it came from.

Speaker 3:          00:25:14       In a nutshell. Basically it goes to three or four pieces of research. Some surveys that went out that were slanted right from the beginning. It's such as a. Do you feel that humans have an impact on climate? Yes. Nobody disagrees with that. So you can go through all the whoever these so-called deniers are. I have looked and looked. Who's, who's denying? Is there any climate scientists on any anywhere on the spectrum that denies that the climate changes or that denies that humans have had an influence on the climate and I haven't found a single one. So in other words, these deniers that you hear about, you know, the climate change deniers, they don't really exist. There are those who criticize the consensus view, right? That the dominant mode of climate change is being induced by humans and they are being shoved into this camp of climate change deniers, but they're not.

Speaker 3:          00:26:07       They're absolutely not climate change deniers. And when you look at it, stuff like this, you know, a lot of these guys who would question the so called anthropogenic climate change consensus are guys who have done this work. Now this work is how old? How? Well, let's go. This goes to the. This goes back to the, to these are the, this work that I'm showing you here. It was published in [inaudible] 93. The, the, the, the, the greenland ice sheet project and the, the greenland ice sheet project into greenland. Oh, I forget it was grip and just the two. It was a european and an american team. They five years drilling, so these are the most accurate proxies. We have it in hand and they're pulling tubes of ice is just like a cylinder. Yeah, like cylinders picture maybe six inches in diameter, so they have like a circular cutting thing and they have a circular cutting drill that extracts these ice cores and for the last 20 years they've been analyzing the ice core, you know, it took five years to get them out and it's been 20 years now of analyzing what they're telling us.

Speaker 3:          00:27:10       So before they had all these ice cores, when they were saying that this climate change took thousands of years, was that just guessing? Pretty much based. That was based upon actual empirical observations of ice glaciers receding as a result of the modern warming because you have to understand up until about the middle of the 19th century, we were in the middle of what was has commonly been referred to as the little ice age. And, and this is another thing that's important to put into context. The ice. The little ice age was in two phases. the earliest phase came on in about the mid 13 hundreds, then it warmed for about a century into 15, 16 hundreds, and then the second phase came on. During that time, the glaciers worldwide began to grow, and most of the evidence today suggests that during the little ice age, glaciers were bigger than they had been in 10,000 years.

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       So around the middle of the 19th century, around 1850, give or take, a decade or two, the climate began to warm out of the little ice age and glaciers began to receive. Right now, if we look at glacier recession that's going on right now, and it's been going on for the last 10 or 20 years, what we see is it's basically a continuation of the recession. It's been going on for 160 or 170 years. Right? So it's important to establish what's our baseline when we're comparing modern recession of glaciers. Bear in mind that our baseline is we're starting from the glaciers being bigger than they had been in 10,000 years. Right? So the. I think then we have to understand that that that little ice agent in fact had some pretty serious consequences for civilization. We can see that there were two period in the last 2000 years.

Speaker 3:          00:29:02       There were two periods of of global cooling. One of them occurred in the sixth century. It actually now can be accurately dated to occurring between 5:36 and 5:44 a d, which is a very interesting time. This was basically the time that historians have have for for decades said this was the onset of the dark ages. It's also the time during which all of the arthurian myths and the grail quest stories are placed. You know arthur arthur, his desk death is, is traditionally placed at the battle of cam land or cam lawn, which is usually dated at about five a which, which basically culminated this quest for the grail. Right. WhAt was the other grail? Stories themselves were, were set down in writing between about 1130 and 1230 d in this really interesting time during the middle ages. At the same time that the great cathedrals were being built.

Speaker 3:          00:30:03       When the cath, our movement was at its strongest when tonight knights of the temple were at their strongest, um, when cobble ism schools were flourishing in Spain, when the troubadours we're making their circuits around europe, uh, you know, spreading news and entertainment, but really probably carrying a esoteric information to the initiates that had the key to the, to the secret language that they use there. It was very interesting time, but it was in that 12, 82, 1130 to 1230, that the, that, the grail stories were written down. Now the grail stories actually refer back to this period of the arthurian days, and the quest for the grail, if you recall, was that the, that the land had succumbed to blight. It had become a wasteland. England who had become a wasteland. And the idea of the grail was it was the grail not only restored the wasteland restored the king, because remember the king, whether it was king arthur or braun, or on toss or the fisher king, there were different names and different stories.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       It was the same deal. He was sick, he was in decline. He was wounded, the wound wouldn't heal, he was debilitated, and the only way to restore him was to find the grail, bring the grail back, allowing to drink from the grail, but the grail was also the means of restoring the wasteland to fertility and fecundity. Now, here's where it gets interesting, is that the dendro chronologists who who studied tree rings have been looking at that period exactly in that period that the, that the tradition places, the grail quest and have discovered that for about eight or 10 years, forest growth in the northern hemisphere almost came to a screeching halt. And this is now been well documented. Mike bailey, who's has done most of this work, I'm basically showing that there was a serious global cooling that took place during those years. And the historical record of that seems to confirm because there's multiple descriptions from irish monks and saw on describinG how for weeks at a time the sun is not visible, that you know, that it's darkness has come over tHe land, that there were reports of these mysterious fogbugz and then there are multiple collapses of agriculture.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       Okay? So, uh, as a result of these multiyear collapses of agriculture because of the cold and the dark and damp, um, people got malnourished and then you had famine as a result of famine. People be there, their immune systems became weakened. And then in five, 42 a d, you had the onset of the justinian plague, which wiped out maybe a third of the population of europe. Whole whole villages disappeared as a consequence. Now these events pretty much followed in sequence. You see, the cold brought about the collapse of agriculture. The collapse of agriculture brought about famine. Famine brought about weakness. And as a result, boom you have flag. Now it took european civilization nearly three centuries to recover from that. Now what brought about the recovery was the return of warmth to the world, what is called the medieval warm period. And between this began really to occur in about 900 add this sea ice began to retract back well inside the arctic circle, which opened up the sea lanes between northern europe, Iceland, and greenland.

Speaker 3:          00:33:39       And so it was this period of time that the, that the, that the vikings were able to sail to Iceland and then sailed to greenland and actually establish a colonies on the west coast of greenland, greenland, and farm or the. Now the ground is perennially perennially frozen. Let me try that again. Per yeley frozen, right? So it was clearly a warm period. And what happened was, if you look back now at the studies from that medieval warm period, you see that agriculture rebounded suddenly. People had lots of food to eat. I'm actually studies of skeletons show that the stature of humans during this period of time increased by four or five inches on average from what it had been during the dark ages. And I'm now europe started becoming wealthy because the basis of all wealth basically was, was agriculture was food, right? Without that, you don't have anything else.

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       Population began to expand enormously. You see other things going on. Um, lifespans increase, a infant mortality decrease. All of this stuff has been well documented in a whole variety of studies. Well, after about a century and a half of this warmth with the, with the concomitant wealth that came along, european society was wealthy enough to undertake this extraordinary cathedral building phase. You see where you had literally hundreds of thousands of highly trained, highly skilled crafts people working on these things. You had essentially, when you begin to look at the cathedral building phenomenon, it required the basically the mobilization of of the whole of european society behind this enterprise, because you had to cory mounts of stone, you had to transport these stones, you had the car of the stones, you look at the statuary, the stain glass, which is exceptional, and it's in its refractive properties that really have still not been mimicked to this day.

Speaker 3:          00:35:33       The way the stained glass was able to refract light so that it gives the appearance of of not the light coming shining through the glass, but emanating from within the glass and you could go on and on with this. ThE, the, the, the carpentry scaled, the engineering skill, the astronomy that went into these structures. All of this combined basically shows up basically in historical instant and in what's interesting is the scarcity of, of evidence showing what proceeded this. How did these, who organized this, who raised the money, who trained the craftsman, you know, this is, there are, there are references to this in history, but really, you know, there's no explicit detailed discussion where we can go and trace it and say, okay, this is, this is how it happened. You know, but it's important to realize that this was a consequence of the, uh, of the, uh, you know, the expansion of, of, of wealth in european society that, that was able to allow this to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       And that's as a consequence of the warmth, the warmth of the earth. And what we see is that the cathedral building era comes to a sudden termination in nearly 13 hundreds. And if you Go on your travel around a cathedrals, you'll find that there is, in many cases, you know, the record suggests that it's almost as if in the middle of their work, the workman laid down their tools and left in some cases. And this is why there were so many cathedrals of the great ones that weren't finished. Okay. but what you see is that exactly concurring with the cessation of cathedral building within a day, within a few decades anyway, was the onset to the little ice age and the return of the cold and this first phase of the little ice age again brought about agricultural collapses at brought about famine. And then you had the black plague that showed up, I think around, whAt was it?

Speaker 3:          00:37:32       13 slash 30 slash 1340 right in there again, decimated the civilization of europe. So you can see, I mean if we look at the historical record, what we see is the times of, of global warming have actually been times of advancement in civilization. Now, of course, That there, that would have its limit. I mean we could get to, you know, at some point where we would get too warm in yours. But so far what we've seen, we're at this point well within the range of natural variability. That's the why is this never brought up by anybody but you. I've never heard anybody else discuss this, this very controversial subject. It's controversial because everyone's so fixated on global warming being a bad thing. It's there. It's there for anybody who is willing to do their homework, you know, and if somebody goes on my website or whatever and says, what are your sources?

Speaker 3:          00:38:26       I'm glad to provide multiple, multiple sources going back. I've been, I've been collecting this data for decades, you know, and it's there and I have to ask the same question. Why are we ignoring this evidence? You know, why are we. Well, the, I think we're ignoring it because climate change has become a political agenda rather rather than a scientific question, you know, and so because there are political factions that are lined up behind it. Um, you know, the inner intergovernmental panel on climate change is now looked at as being the ultimate source for data on, on the climate. And bear in mind, they were created by the united nations framework convention on climate change and given the mandate of go out there and demonstrate that humans are causing climate change. So right from the very start, that was their mission. And they were not told go and look for natural causes of natural climate variability, study the human and.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       And it's important and I mean I'm not at all saying it's not important for us to study our own effects on climate, but it's going to be dangerous. I think if, if we neglect, you know, what we're seeing right here on these graphs or this graph that I'm showing you because that's clearly not carbon dioxide. See if we're told, and we have been repeatedly told that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere held relatively steady at about 280 parts per million, right? Prior to the industrial revolution and only subsequent to the industrial revolution. Did cArbon dIoxide start going up? Well, if we assume just for the sake of argument that, that. That's correct. We'll look at this graph. What we're saying is that if carbon dioxide held steady at 280 parts per million going back hundreds of thousands of years as al gore is actually stated, and as many others have stated, it's not carbon dioxide driving those climate changes, is it?

Speaker 3:          00:40:16       well, it can't be that it can't be new. if that's the case, and that's hard science, this is hard science, right? It's hard science as well. You're. You're looking at something really crazy. Some event. Yeah. Yeah. That's my point. Now the alternative is, okay, are we saying if, if, if carbon dioxide is the dominant driver of climate change and that's what we're seeing here, then what that basically says is that there is some gigantic unknown reservoirs of co two that have outgassed into the atmosphere, which again undermines the so called consensus view because so far the consensus view, the consensus view states that the ceo has only increased because of burning fossil fuel. So this graph is the real inconvenient truth. This graph that's well put. Yes, this graph is the real inconvenient truth and when we look at some of this, I mean right there, that is a major global warming right there because this dashed line represents the modern temperature like the date, the 20th century average is this dash line, that dash line. What year are we looking at? Right there, right here. This is between 100 and 150,000 years ago, and that's a giant jump. That's a gIant joe. I mean, so what, what does that represent as far as degrees in temperature? Oh, well, let's

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       see. That's probably going to be, you know, 15 to 18 degrees fahrenheit. Whoa. Yeah, right there. So that's, you know, again, 15 to 18 times greater than the, than the, the presumed temperature increase of the last century. Is there any mainstream, I shouldn't say mainstream scientific explanation for what that is? No. Well, it's called the eemian called the eemian periods in interglacial period, but even within the interglacial period, you see that there are these massive oscillations, massive cooling, cooling and warming again. Yeah. And so there's a variability if you're saying the warming is between it's 18 degrees. That what you said to up to that. So the cooling, you're talking about almost that much in the other direction. The other direction. Yeah. And who you're talking about this over a period of just a few decades. Well, as we get back this far, we don't have the same degree of precision is we do when we're, we're here.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       um, perhaps yes, but we were not sure, but we do know that these changes that we're looking at here, the terminated the last ice age. We're just in a matter of a few years. Yeah, for sure. And the instantaneous nature of those is what you focus on when you start talking about asteroidal impacts and things along those lines of that is something that we can explain. It's something you can point to by default. There doesn't seem to be a lot of other things that we can invoke to explain what we're seeing right here. And there's absolute evidence that we have been hit multiple times. We're going to get into that. Yes, yes. And, and that's a big part of what, what graham's book is going to be amazing. when you look at the ancient history, I mean it's not even ancient as far as me and they were human beinGs living sort of like us, but how much different the climate was like, it was so fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       Well, I'm not sure about the west coast, but I know on the east coast there were, you know, swarms of icebergs stranding, like off the coast of South Carolina, for example, you know, there was no great lakes because of the great lakes were under thousands of feet of ice, you know, New York, boston, detroit, um, seattle, portland, or not sort of a portland, but seattle, twin cities, chicago. All of these areas were under thousands of feet of ice, thousands of feet. And we're not talking millions of years ago. We're talking 12, 13,000 to 25 to 30,000 years ago. That's incredible. It is. And, and sea levels were basically in round numbers, 400 feet lower than now, which essentially exposes the entire con. Most of the continental shelves. And I'm going to, I've got some, some interesting graphics here to show you, uh, what, what continental coastlines would have looked like. There was an article that I was reading recently about aborigines in aboriginal tales of, uh, of the lowered, like lowered levels

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       that they're starting to correspond now with actual climate data and understanding of what the sea levels actually war at that time. And these are stories that are supposedly 10,000 years old pass through oral traditions. These traditions to me are just beyond valuable, you know, up until very recently they have been considered basically just, you know, interesting in the, in the, in the anthropological or psychological sense, but had no real hard scientific credibility to them. Now I think we're beginning to reevaluate them near as an archeologist, this archeologist by the name of Bruce Massey, who's been doing some very interesting work in for the last 20 years analyzing, uh, many of these ancient myths and realizing and putting out there the argument that these, that these myths and these legends in these epic tales a code really hard scientific information that we could extract from them. And I'm talking about global changes and astronomical events and so forth.

Speaker 3:          00:45:36       And, and um, so, and I've been a believer in that for a long time, you know, and this is one of the premises of graham's work is that, that the myths and the legends actually have a great deal to teach us beyond just the psychological orientation of our ignorant pre-scientific ancestors, you know. But yeah, a good point you make there. Um, when we look at this graph, basically what we're seeing here is that coming out of the ice age, you can kind of see that we're coming up here and then we have this massive spike of warming and then it seesaws back down into this full glacial cold. This is called this period between these two green arrows is called the younger dryas, which is named after a polar wildflower that had disappeared in northern europe and then suddenly came back again. It only grows in polar environments, a dry us octa patella.

Speaker 3:          00:46:29       So the younger dryas compared because there was an older darius too, but it lasted. Now the dates are placing it from roughly 12,000, 900 years ago, give or take a few decades to 11,600 years ago. So this spike of warming right here is 11,600 years. Now, if we look at the next one here, this graph basically goes to a different realm of evidence. and what this shows is the average, the rate of sea level rise. You see now oceanographers marine geologists have been studying. There'S, there's a number of dIfferent ways they can correlate this information. They can look at actual evidence of submerged shorelines, right? They can look at changes in the, in the flora and the fauna that have, that have lived in the oceans. They can look at coRal reefs. Uh, there's a lot of different things that they can pull together to see how rapidly sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age and again, generation or two ago.

Speaker 3:          00:47:33       The assumption was is that there was a smooth continuum of rise that took tens of thousands of years, right? To get us from minus 400 feet up to what we are now. At the present level, what this graph shows is that there were two massive spikes of meltwater introduced into the oceans, into the global oceans at the end of the last ice age, and you can see The first spike called meltwater pulse one a is the biggest followed by another one, meltwater pulse one b. If we go back to this graph right here, those two spikes of glacial melt water and sea level rise coincided with this warming spike and net warming spike, and you can see how this warming spike seems to be the most intense followed by this one. And we see that meltwater pulse one a is the biggest. So what this is showing is that the, that the rise in sea level was not as smooth.

Speaker 3:          00:48:27       It was like, whoa. And then warm up again. So there was something that caused all those glaciers to melt within just a very short amount of time. A geologically speaking, yes, a geological instant. Exactly. What's further interesting is when we look at this graph, this is the late pleistocene mortality graph, and each square represents a fossil specimen of an extinct mammal. You know, could be a woolly mammoth, could be a giant ground sloth, could be a saber tooth cat, could be the giant cave bear roughly 120 species of mega mammals that lived during the ice age when extinct right at the end of the ice age in basically what this graph is showing us here is that you probably can't read this here, so oh interpreted for you. if you go back to here, the left side represents 50,000 years ago and here were where the cursor is. That's 40,000 years, 30,000, 20,000, and you see that as we're going along here.

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       Each one of these squares represents the finding of a fossil, of an extinct mammal in the, in the fossil record. What we see from this graph is that when we get to between 11 and 13,000 years ago, there's a massive spike of calendar shoots through the roof. This demise of these animals directly coincided directly coincides with this right here directly. Now what we, what we're dealing with is that for 50 years the dominant theory has been, is called overkill or blitzkrieg and this theory basically states that bands have paleo. Indian hunters came across the bering land bridge, slaughtering every animal that they encountered along the way and somehow within less than a thousand years, swept from siberia down to tierra del fuego and killed off every willie, every man within the world, and presumably every other of the extinct mammals. And that has been the dominant theory that, that humans caused this mass extinction.

Speaker 3:          00:50:36       And personally I think that's just absurd because for one thing, based upon anthropological studies, there were possibly more wooly mammoths in the world and there were people for awhile. Um, you know, you have to assume that the blitz creek was so instantaneous and so all encompassing that there was no time even for the mammas to, to reproduce. Of course, the overkill hypothesis basically addresses itself only to Willie May or only to mammoths. Wooly mammoths were one species of four different species of mammals. But what about the other roughly 120 species? What about the, the giant armadillos into a giant beavers in the american place to see lion that was as big as big as a horse. Uh, You know, the list goes on and on and on and on in these animals all basically disappeared during this spike that you see right here. And that spike faults exactlY between these two warming spikes and between the two sea level rises.

Speaker 3:          00:51:31       So all the data, all points that same time period. Yes. Wow. And so what I'm saying, and this is, this is, uh, you know, basically consistent with what graham singh and his book is that, this, this, what we're seeing here, this episode basically represents a curtain that has come down and obscured 150,000 or more years of deep human history and basically his last that history to modern perception. But now once we understand that, yeah, you know what the uniformitarians were wrong to reject all ideas of catastrophism, you know, because in the original, in the early days of geology, the, the founding fathers of geology, we're catastrophists. They went out in the field unencumbered, unencumbered, unencumbered by dogmas and doctrines. And so forth, they looked at the evidence in the field and concluded that there had been catastrophic episodes. And this is a baron von qva, sedgwick murchison, if you'd go back and you're all of these guys who basically are considered the godfathers of modern geology, they were to a man catastrophist, uh, james hutton, lyle and play fair came along and basically proposed the idea of uniformitarianism.

Speaker 3:          00:52:53       The present is the key to the past. Very powerful. A working idea is that we can look at stuff that's going on today, extrapolate backwards and try to figure out things that happened in the past when we don't have an eyewitness account. Right? Very powerful. But what, what happened was it became so entrenched as dogma that anybody who invoked catastrophes was considered, um, basically fringe. Because in the early days, some of these guys like sedgwick, for example, he was a theologian. He was a traveling minister who went around and in his travels to convert that, the people to, to christianity, he would see the stuff and he would, you know, place it within the context perhaps of being noah's flood, right? And they would place it in some of, not all of them, some of them would place it in a, in a biblical context. Right? So when they were attacked, basically the, the substance of the attack was, well you guys are trying to bring us back to the days of biblical literalism in sciences.

Speaker 3:          00:53:58       Moved beyond that. We're not here, we don't want to talk about catastrophes or great floods. Dahlias weren't. We're through talking about all of that. That's all been discredited. And what you see is between the early 18 hundreds with the beginning of geology, earth science too, about the 19th century, what you see as a steady decline, you know, some of the older guys die off, they're replaced by the new guys who have now basically taken control of the university curriculums. And they been indoctrinated into this idea of a strict gradUalism. And at any deviation from that strict gradualism is, is a heresy basically. So by the time we get to the 20th century, you had this raining uniformity, raining gradualists dogma that had been imposed upon all earth science. And anybody who deviated from that was immediately kicked out of the club. And this is why when jay harlan brett's came along in the 19 twenties and proposed that there had been these gigantic floods in the pacific northwest, you know, the geological community basically said, get outta here.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       We don't want to hear aBout it. We know that that couldn't have been just because we know jay harlan brett's continued to document, exhaustively document from the field that, that these floods were very real. His critics said, well, you don't, you can't provide a source for these floods. Therefore they didn't happen. Now, bear in mind that all of his critics is his most vocal critics had never even gone out to actually look right. And a gram is going to hit. It's got a great section in his new upcoming book describing the, the ordeal that brett's was put through. But he finally prevailed of ultimately, um, most of his critics died off, you know, he outlived and he lived to be, I think 98. So I think when he was 96, he was given the penrose metal, which is the highest honor of geology and the only, he said he was very grateful, but the only thing he he was unhappy about was the fact that he, all of his critics had died off.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       So he didn't get to gloat over. So. But, um, but so What happened was you had the younger geologists come in who are, who are more open to that in, in what you see is between the fifth, 19, 15 and 19 sixties. You have a transition going on where we're, where they're beginning to accept that these great floods that happened. But, but what they did was they took a modern example, which is glacial outburst floods, which we've witnessed dozens and dozens, probably hundreds of suitcases in Iceland, particularly Alaska, british columbia of the himalayas where you have particularly going back to the little ice age. When the glaciers began to recede in the mid 19th century, you had a lot of what are called pro glacial lakes formed or lakes bodies of water held in by the melting ice. And then eventually the ice gave way into the water, rushed out in the form of a flood.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       The icelanders call it a yoke elopes. Okay, so we have a modern example. So what they did was in the sixties and seventies was they said, okay, guess what? We've got now evidence that there was a huge body of water, huge lake in western Montana, and it was held in by an ice dam. That ice dam gave way all of this water gushed out over Idaho and in southeastern Washington down to columbia gorge to the pacific ocean, and caused all of these, this amazing erosion and sedimentation that harland brett's was documenting. Never mind that we have to extrapolate up three orders of magnitude from modern examples, right? Nevermind, that the modern examples are utterly minuscule compared to what brett's was looking at. That has become the dogma to explain these floods and it's still the entrenched dogma as we speak. Now I am trying to demolish that dogma.

Speaker 3:          00:57:52       I want to show that these floods were something much grander than they have even imagined, and that the source of him was not actually a big glacial lake, but was, was what brett's originally originally theorized was that there was something that caused a rapid melting of the ice. But then his critics said, well, there's nothing that could melt the ice as fast as you're requiring for your floods. So again, your floods didn't happen, but his floods did happen and they were on an enormous inconceivably vast scale. And this is what I was taking him out to see firsthand because I felt like for him to, to really have a handle on this, uh, this information and this, this insight into the catastrophes that, that basically would have terminated his mother civilization as he called it, that he should see this stuff in the field for himself.

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       Because, you know, as they say, a picture's worth a thousand words. We're going out in the field and experiencing this directly is worth a thousand pictures. And, and so he's going to incorporate that into his, into his book. And I would like to say about that book, that that, based upon what I know and what you've shown me, a bit of what's going into the book I'll I'll proclaim without any equivocation that I think is probably going to be the most important book that's come out in a 21st century because it's opening a window onto this story, like no other single source of information. CredIble information. Wow, that's a big. It's a big statement. This, this whole thing is so mind blowing and as mind blowing as your first appearances. This chart especially is really freaking me out. Like looking at the mortality, all the animals, the mass extinction event that must have taken place.

Speaker 3:          00:59:37       One of the things that always bothered me about that idea that human beIngs killed off the wooly mammoths is that they found these vast fields of uneaten mammoths where there was thousands of them that had died almost instantaneously, which is just. That doesn't make any sense. Like what did they do? They went on a mass killing orgy of slaughter and then just decided not to eat any of them. Well, you know, the field evidence itself is inconsistent with that idea right here. This is an example. This is one of the many mammoth cemeteries and and what happens is that you can see here that you can see from the shoreline seated, there was a flood, the river rose up to this level, and then when it rolls down, it left this in its wake. And what you see here like this is bone counting at the barrel mammoth cemetery in northern yakutia siberia.

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       Identical deposits are found throughout the tamer peninsula in what we see here is these massive bone deposits that have been showing up for the last couple of hundred years. Every time that there's a thawing or a flood or these things are washed up on the shore of the arctic ocean. You know what we see is that there were huge, huge herds of wooly mammoths grazing. We're now the plant material is only two inches high. So clearly it was a completely different climate there. You know, what's interesting is that you, you had in siberia able to support herds of wooly mammoths at the same time that half of north America is buried under two miles or more advice. How is that possible? Just a totally different atmosphere. Still puzzling over that. I have some ideas, but until I can test these ideas a little further. Um, so without an ice core samples, is it impossible to figure out what the temperature was in siberia at that time? No, no. They configure out basically based upon fossil plant remains. And you can see that in some cases the tree line was hundreds of miles further north than it is now. An ex. Clearly if you've got trees, forests growing now were 13 or 14 or 15,000 years ago. It was permafrost, you know, it was warmer clearly.

Speaker 3:          01:01:51       So there's still. Whoa. What does that 19th century scene showing every floor of the london docks covered by thousands of mammoth tusks from siberia. This is a drawing obviously, pre dates, photographs, yeah. For hundreds of years, thousands of mammas in tombed, mammoth and mammoth tusks were being zoomed from the siberian permafrost. Thousands and thousands and thousands of these. And, and basically

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       to me, you look at this, this is just in your face evidence that this was not humans doing this, you know, it was not humans that were, were slaughtering these mammas and burying near remains it, it the instantaneous nature would almost. It would almost be like people have figured out some new thing, like they figured out some, some like, uh, a doom gun, you know, where they shot the whole, the doom got well, look at, look at the near extinction of american bison. What brought that about trains and high powered rifles, right? It was a technological major, technological advancement that was able to bring about the near extermination of the american, especially a guy that I'm going to bring on the podcast soon to discuss that. As name's dan flores, who spent a big chunk of his intellectual career studying this. And what he believes is that the bison had a massive population jump that was directly correlating to smallpox epidemic.

Speaker 4:          01:03:26       The native american people and that when the United States, when we look at the United States history in the big stacks of woolly mammoths, or excuse me, the big stacks of bison skulls, we always look to like that was a very unusual population of bison that existed because the plains indians had experienced this massive extinction event and then when they had incorporated the horse like the horse and the. Apparently the american indians, native americans rather were on their way to extra padding the bison even before we came along. But then they died off in this massive death scenario with small pox and all the different diseases that the europeans had brought over here. And then the mammoth population, or excuse me, the bison population had grown like almost unnaturally. It'd been much larger than it ever been in the past and that's when the United States was established and that's when all the western european immigrants had come along and started killing off all these bisons.

Speaker 4:          01:04:32       It's really a very interesting subject and it's an interesting idea. It's plausible. I haven't looked into that. You know, I, I just assumed, and maybe maybe wrongfully, but I had assumed that the bison population had been relatively stable. I am not convinced though, that, that there was this massive die off of the native american population yet I'm not convinced maybe, well, because I haven't looked into it yet, but, but you know, one of the things I've seen is that the assumption there is predicated upon the europeans arrived and brought the diseases that, that, uh, that native americans had no defenses for. But the thing is, is that, you know, there's so much evidence now showing that there were lots of explorers in immigrants

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       to the new world prior to the arrival of the europeans. You know, the chinese, the phoenicians. And I'm not necessarily saying that's credible that none of it's been proven. But there's some interesting data out there that suggests in there a number of books written that again, I haven't accessed it. So I'm not gonna sit here and pretend that I'm an authority on that because I'm not. But, but if some of that turns out to be credible, it would suggest that there was a lot more interaction between the native american population and other groups around the world, which, if true to me kind of somewhat undermines this idea that they were, you know, completely susceptible to the introduction of these, you know, to these foreign diseases. But again, I will, I've got an open mind. I'll wait and see. I'd like to see what his, what he says, I'd like to hear his, his, uh, his idea

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       for anyone interested in. He has a paper in the journal of american history. It's called bison ecology and bison diplomacy. The southern plains from 1800 to 1850. Um, I just looked for it online. You can, there's a preview that's available, but to download the entire paper or book, I'm not sure which one it is. It's $19. And what's, what journal is it in the journal of american history from september of [inaudible] 91. And like I said, he's working on a new book right now and uh, I'm trying to get them to come in, but it's just, it's very difficult while he's in the middle of a, you said september of 1991. Yeah. Yeah, I can probably access dan flores is his name. And uh, well just the information that I got about it was pretty mind blowing, but a sounds interesting. I want to know more. Thank you for that. Joe, please. Now let's, let's go back to that photo that you have on your desktop that you were going to explain to me, but we decided not to talk about it before the podcast because it's so incredible that you said this. All this incredible change that we're looking at the, the, the geological structure, all that took place within just a week.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       Yeah. Let's go to. This will, will come. I've got that world will come to that. This is a, this is a satellite photograph taken from about 500 miles up. And what you see here, this is southeastern Washington, and what you're looking at here is part of what's called the columbia basalt plateau. This is part of the terrain that, that we crossed when I was with graham. What you see here is that you have an area of, if you look here, you can see the, um, oh, differentiate between the pixels in the actual squares that like, you see this red area down here is area that's actually being farmed and it's an in because this is an photograph. And so what happens is, is that the areas that are being cultivated will show up warmer than the surrounding areas. this is, this whole plateau is covered in this stuff called los l o e s s, and it's a type of very fertile soil that has a rather mysterious and controversial origin.

Speaker 3:          01:08:34       We'll get into that right now, but in some places, this last layer is hundreds of feet thIck, over a dark basalt bedrock that is the result of, of these massive outflows of basaltic lava, uh, that, that came out, did extruded between about $6 million and 16 million years ago. Right. The, the hotspot, that was the ultimate origin of this basalt is now we're yellowstone is which, so you can make that connection near the yellowstone super volcano. Super volcano. Yeah. Yeah. In, in, um, but what you have here is that you have the lighter areas is where this lust topsoil still exists and the darker areas is where the, the, the underlying dark basalt has been, is showing through because the loss was washed away. So what this is, is, is your typical, the geological term is and nasda moseying and basically that means a branching flow pattern of the water and you can see that very clearly here that the water came off of this river, which is the columbia river up here and float over the landscape and washed away the basalt and left these gigantic channels in its wake and there's more over here to the, to the east and there's more over here to the west.

Speaker 3:          01:09:54       Um, and if we look at actually this, let me go to a different program here. I think that will actually have some that actually I think has the picture in it that you were seeing. Now what we're looking at here is what's been called the missoula flood, right? Named after the town of missoula, Montana. Missoula is in a basin that was part of this hypothesized giant lake that that presumably caused this flood. Right. And again, there was an ice dam that there was this ice dam, the ice dam broke and as soon as this thing comes up, I will be able to show you some slides. Here we go. Let's see. here we go. It's becoming operate here. While that's coming up, we'll look at this slide right here because this will kind of give you a, a picture of the earth as it was during the height of the ice age.

Speaker 3:          01:10:56       So wow, that's pretty deep. The sheets of ice go pretty far down. That's amazing. Canada didn't exist. Candidate in exist. Wow. Yeah. Poor canadians. Well yeah. And you know, and you know, the ice part of it is, you know, a lot of that in the midwest now. A lot of the farming belt of America is basically growing out of the fertile soil that the ice scraped off of Canada and dumped down in Minnesota and Iowa and Wisconsin and so on. So, um, you know, some day they may want that back, but we're not going to let him have it. It's fascinating when you look at that, that there was this big ice cap, but then the areas around it, no ice and why, why was that? Well, that's one of the mysteries, again, like over here in siberia can see over here, this is where all the woolly mammoths were.

Speaker 3:          01:11:51       Giant herds of bully mammoths and it appears lIke it may have been warmer than now during the ice age, which is very odd. There's some ice up there. Is that what we're seeing? Yeah, there's some ice up there. Sporadic glaciers, but nothing like what we see in northwestern europe over here. This was called the pheno scandi and ice sheet. And the sheet over north America actually consisted of two ice sheets, the lauren laurentide, which was centered over hudson bay, and record the aaron, which was centered over the canadian rockies. And in this particular slide you can see a, you can see here, this was the core of the aaron over here, over the canadian rockies, and this was the law, the laurentide was much bigger c, and then there was an area between the two right here, which has been theorized as a, at one point, having been a corridor called the icefree corridor in migrants from paleoindian. Migrants from siberia would have come across Alaska and down through this corridor here to the lower United States and ultimately down here to south America. And it was that group, these groups of bands of paleo indian hunters that according to the overkill or blitzkrieg hypothesis wiped out the, the, the, the mega mammals as they, as they passed by.

Speaker 5:          01:13:18       It's just.

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       Let's see. Okay, there we go. Okay. So here, this will show, uh, the coastlines of the, uh, of the world during the, uh, during the ice age. And uh, let me just escape out of this so that we can zoom in a little bit and look at it closer. Okay. So here would be, as we see now,

Speaker 5:          01:13:57       and

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       this is modern coastline, this is modern coastlines. And now I'm going to, I'm going to jump to. This is actually only 300 feet lower than now and quite a bit different. let's just look at the United States.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       North America. That's amazinG. It was a lot more United States. Yeah. Now check this out. Okay. Now here, here's north America city is now, and you see up here, this is what's called, this is the bering strait right here in between Alaska and siberia, right during the ice age. This whole area was exposed it because of the lowered sea level. And we'll go one slide further and you will see. Take a look. Now, watch what happens up there. And Bahrain jia. Boom. Wow. So it's all land. It's all land and it's connecting north America to siberia. And that's all drowned. Last didn't understand that. See, I always thought that the bering strait was an ice mass that thought it was during the ice age, that there was some sort of us that it was ice, but it's not. It's land. It's land. wow. and it's not glaciated.

Speaker 1:          01:15:03       And it was home to these extraordinary herds of mega mammals that ranged over these thousands and thousands of square miles. I mean the drowned areas bigger than modern Alaska. So how, how long ago was this? When this is, you know, right at the end, up until the end of the ice age, you know, between like 14, 15,000 years ago, 14, 50,000 years ago. Know glacIers in this area. This is all just land and there's animals living in it and people are walking back and forth is. I mean, essentially it was a continent. I mean it was connected. There was all one continent. It was all one. It was all one continent. Wow. That's amazing. And the coastlines of the world. Look at Florida down here. See, it's douBle the width of the modern peninsula. Yeah, it's enormous and it's so close to Mexico too. It's almost like a little boat ride. Now, here is Indonesia and you know, we're, we're stories, which I don't know how credible they are, but you know, there are stories like memoria and the pacific and all of them.

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       again, I don't know, a credible. Those are. I think the atlanta story actually has a little more credibility. We talked about that last time somewhat, but here's the modern and you can see the light. Blue is the, is the coastal shelf area right now. Let's go back drop. We're going to drop sea level 300 feet and then you'll see here the enormous change. Whoa. So again, enormous areas of land were drowned by the rising sea levels. Remember this now, when we look at the rise of modern cities and modern civilizations, where did they first show up? We're going to coast to coast, right at the mouths of rivers, on the coastlines, and in during the ice age, where would have been the most obvious? Prime, habitable real estate down close to sea level, right? So if there were cities built, you know, if they were thriving communities during the ice age, there are now 400 feet under the water. It's so amazing that all of these stories of floods, the epic of gilgamesh, noah's ark. Yeah. They all have these stories seem to really correlate with, with all this data.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       I mean, they all seemed to coincide. That's exactly the point. It's so weird. I, you know, most people would think about the story of noah's ark. Oh, it's just crazy old horse shit, but it's most likely this. They're basing it on something that happened very rapidly in their area. Yeah. Now, of course we were most familiar with the story of noah's ark, you know, because of the judeo christian tradition. But there are hundreds, literally hundreds of stories from all over the world that parallels the story of noah. One yard. You kaylene thrusts the, pitched them, man knew that list goes on and on of these culture heroes that somehow had for knowledge of this impending disaster. And we're able To take steps to preserve themselves, their family, some diverse cross section of, of species. Um, which, and they all have this similarity. They all parallel now my way of looking at it as this.

Speaker 3:          01:18:12       Okay, we now know from the hard geological record that massive floods have taken place on the surface of the earth, massive floods, right beyond anything that we have even imagined right up until a decade or few decades ago. They're real okay. On the other hand, we have stories and myths and legends repeatedly. It's probably the most ubiquitous of all the stories that we've inherited from the past is this story of this gigantic world destroying flood that occurred right now. On one hand we have the geological hard geological record, which shows there were giant floods. Then we have these epIc tales and myths from all over the world about giant floods. Do we now dismissed those flood, those, those stories out of hand and say, oh, that's just superstitious preliterate, you know, pseudoscientific nonsense. I think we'd be making a big mistake to do that. Now if we accept that those flood stories and maybe they have been altered through time and through the telling represent something real.

Speaker 3:          01:19:19       What about the other other elements of the story, the fact that in so many cases there was somebody that had for knowledge, do we dismiss that out of hand as well, you know, or where does that come from? That there was one group of people, small group of people that saw this thing coming and prepared for it and others who basically paid no attention. Maybe they would just preppers. Maybe there's the prep for 10,000 years ago. Preppers have 10,000 years on those tv shows that explains it. Right? The one last slide quick here, here's, here's europe and look at the british isles right now. We'll drop sea level. No british isles. That's incredible. See, that's what I was saying earlier when we started talking to the world of 15,000 years ago was so dramatically different than our modern world that, you know, it's, it's almost difficult to conceive until you start looking at things like this.

Speaker 3:          01:20:16       and this is all during the ice age. Yes. And so the melting of the glaciers just changed everything. Every thought process while human beings were absolutely alive. So yeah, absolutely, absolutely no question. The human human beings were alive. Yes. Okay, so we'll start looking at some of these pictures here. This is from western Montana. You know it says in genesis seven, 19, the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills recovered. We want you to take a look. As you can see many mountains in western United States. If you know what you're looking at that have this on them, you know what those are, those horizontal lines they look like, like where the shore there shoreline exactly their shorelines. That's absolutely what they are. That's absolutely what they are. Their shorelines reaching right up to the very tops of the hills. You see, and basically what you had was you had this enormous gush of water filling these mountain valleys almost to the mountain peaks and then draining away and as it drained away, it left the succession of shorelines etched into the hillside and all along the pathway of the floods, we're going to see stuff like this.

Speaker 3:          01:21:32       This right? This was our first stop with graham. This is a lot to ral falls. This is that basalt I was talking about. Look at this stuff. There's layers of this basalt or that's you guys underneath it. Um, I don't think in despair. I think I took this picture about 10 years ago, but yeah, I have pictures of me and graham under there. The, you're so tiny. That's so crazy. It's so big right now. Here's what you've got to picture joe picture. You've got this nice gentle valley with a nice river, very pastoral scene. You know, trees and stuff. Probably mamasan herds of animals grazing along the side of this peaceful river with gentle chatt valley slopes. Here comes this massive flood and we're talking about perhaps a flood wave 800, 1000 feet hIgh coming through as it comes through. It's ripping up everything in its path and it, what it does is it now changes the profile of his valley from this gentle profile to downcutting 800, a thousand, 1200 feet or more into the bedrock.

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       Right? So now prior to the passage of this giant flood, you had streams and nice little rivers flowing into the main river, which in this case was the columbia. What happens is after the passage of this flood wave, it sheared off the sides of the channel, so the now rather than a gentle slope, you've got sheer cliffs, four, five, 600 feet high. These pre-flood streams and rivers come up and are now waterfalls, and that's what we're looking at right here in this picture, if that makes sense to you, and and you notice how you've got this undercutting here, that undercutting only occurs when you have enormous intense turbulence in the water doIng this. You see the water doing this will undercut. See this modern waterfall here had nothing to do with the creation of this cliff. This cliff was cut again probably in a matter of days to weeks by the passage of these jargon floods, and there's dozens of these waterfalls that are left.

Speaker 3:          01:23:44       They're called and these are called hanging valleys. They can be produced by glaciers, but they can also be produced by enormous intense flood waves. This is your typical, not no appointment, not typical. This is called. This is a bar. I'm a gravel bar, but in this case it's a boulder bar. And if you've ever done any walking along a river or a creek or along the beach and you've seen ripples in the sand and they're typically, you know, if you've got a water that's a foot or two feet deep, you don't have ripples that are maybe an inch or two high. What we're looking at here is a flood bar that's three miles long. It's up to 250 feet above the modern river. And the ripples that you can see here are up to 50 feet in height and 350 feet in wavelength. This was produced again by gigantic flood flows.

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       And if we look right over here, that's a three story building you see right there for scale. Um, wow. So this, this gives you an idea. It's, it's features like this that are just unequivocal in terms of realizing that this is, this is not pseudoscience. This really happened. And this is, there's this date back to a very specific time. Yes to this 13,000 year. So everywhere you're seeing thIs, you've seen a. Geologically you've seen an ice core as you're seeing it in fossils. Yes. Yes. Wow, this is evidence of the big meltdown. Has anybody ever tried to debate you on this stuff? Uh, I would certainly welcome debate. I don't claim to have the final, final word on this, but you know, here's the thing. I've, I've interacted with a lot of geologists that are studying this professional geologists. They're studying this. what I can tell you is that in most cases, the geologists that are studying it, it's not something, it's basically something that you're doing in your spare time.

Speaker 3:          01:25:46       Um, most of them are engaged, you know, either you know, in the, uh, in energy industry or working for government for other purposes. What you actually will see here though, when you being to look at the, the, the trend in the evidence is that I think that the geological community is moving much closer to a scenario like I'm describing. And right now there's actually a controversy because, you know, some of the older guard is wanting to defend this idea of the old collapse. This pro, this giant lake draining out. There are a group of canadian geologists though, who are, who are challenging that under a leadership of a man who may now be retired named John Shaw, who goes back to the 19 eighties and began a reinterpretation of a, of a very ubiquitous glacial feature called [inaudible]. Um, and, and that we're, I can show you some pictures of him here after a bit there.

Speaker 3:          01:26:39       They're very interesting. um, they look like inverted bolt holes and it was assumed and are always associated with the locations of the glaciers and the ice sheets. So it was therefore assume that they were somehow created by the glaciers themselves, but glaciers tend to grind things that they're moving over in level things off and scratch them and leave striations. And all of this abrasion, these drum ones are smooth, streamlined features. What shaw first proposed back in the late eighties was that they had actually been produced by water flowing massive amounts of water flowing under the glaciers. And there's a very similar, the, the, the, the critics said, well, where does this water come from? And he said, well, I don'T know. It must have been enormous. SubglacIal lake subglacial reservoirs. The critics said, well, there's no way that our reservoir is huge as your floods would require, could have existed under the ice.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       Therefore your subglacial floods didn't exist and that was the. To me, the fatal weakness in his theory was to explain where the water came from, but I think now we can't explain where it came from and you believe it's an asteroid impact again, by default I, there's, we have, we look at all the possible, the cross section of possible explanations within the realm of nature. We can go through and we can eliminate this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, and what we're left with is one that of itself would be fully capable of doing it fully capable and make sense that it would happen instantaneous. That would make sense. It would happen instantaneously. Other sort of thing that would. Yes. So is there an impact crater that corresponds to this timeline or. That's what I'm working on trying to find it. Yeah, and I think I've.

Speaker 3:          01:28:24       I think I've got a pretty good idea, but it's going to take some field research and next summer I'm planning to do some some more field research. Is there an idea where it hit a. Yeah, I have several ideas. We don't want to talk about it when it's. When it's time to reveal it. Okay. Let's do it here. Oh, I'd love that. I would love that. Well, you, you've shown several impact craters. You showed a bunch last time you were here, the one in Australia that was, I believe you said 500 years ago. Yeah, and of course everybody medically, it hasn't been proven yet because again, some of these more recent craters of the last 10,000 years, some of these that have been hypothesized are actually on the bottom of the ocean. The trader that I think we talked about on the bottom of the indian ocean, it's under two miles of seawater, so until we can actually get back there in and do more in depth sampling in examination, it'll be impossible to prove it, but I think that the, the evidence is stronGly supportive of that possibility that maybe 5,000 years ago there was a significant impact into the indian ocean that could have caused enormous tsunami waves.

Speaker 3:          01:29:35       Now, I actually posted one of the, uh, somebody called into queStion some of the things I had said in the last interview about tsunamis. And at that the things I was saying weren't really tsunami. So I actually wrote an elaborate response to that which is posted on the sacred geometry website where I've gone into great detail. I'm showing that the evidence really in the end I think does support the idea that there had been enormous tsunamis, possibly hundreds of feet high, sweeping over the coastlines of the indian ocean probably around 5,000 years ago. That could have been the origin of some of the flood myths

Speaker 4:          01:30:18       and your timeline where this mass extinction event occurred, where the massive warming occurred. all of that also coincides with the discovery of this nuclear glass all over asian europe, which is somewhere in the when they do the core samples of around the same area, right around $12,000

Speaker 3:          01:30:40       years ago. Yes. We can see here. We'll go through a second. This is some of the research you can see. This is. This is very typical, the mysterious onset of the younger dryas. Now this is. This has been the kind of the consensus view is that, okay, we don't have an explanation. The younger dryas remembers. That's an interval between those two spikes, right where you had the warming than the snap back to glacial cold and in the warming again, so that interval in between is the younger dryas. So here they're saying the mysterious onset of the younger dryas, the 1300 year long younger dryas cold reversal, and you notice the date's twelve thousand nine hundred and eleven thousand six hundred. That means calendar years before present. So what they've done is they've calibrated this from radio carbon dating too, which is not necessarily going to be the same as the actual calendar years. So those dates are very interesting. Um, 11,000, 600 years ago, you may recall from our last interview, is the date given by plato for the subsidence of atlantis. Eleven thOusand. I mean, he says that atlanta subsided in. You can. Anybody can read this if they want to pick up timaeus and critias the two dialogues that he describes atlantis and he gives that date 9,000 years before the

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       exile of long in Egypt, which took place in 600 bc roughly. So six huNdred bc in rough roughly is 2,600 years ago. Add that to the 9,000 years and years. Your $11,600. So now what has happened is 2,500 years ago, plato gave a date, which would seem to suggest that something, some something. A man's happened in the atlantic ocean and you had an island complex that sank perhaps from rapid sea level rise. Now 2,500 years later. Here's modern science coming up with the exact date showing, hey, there was a massive meltwater pulse into the ocean at that date. Now at this point, nobody within mainstream science is going, oh, well, see he doesn't mention here. Oh, that's the date given by plato. They don't say that, but it's. It is the case. That's incredible. That's so amazing. Now, plato, that he was told that it was all through stories.

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       It was. Yeah, it was handed down soul on, handed down. Let's see if I can remember this. Through deprived esther pitus to courteous. The elder critias, the elder to courteous. The younger then critias the younger, I guess to socrates actually at the forum we're plato would have heard it would have been the socratic forum where it was told, so I think there was like three generations between salon in plato, the wise men of the time or the people that were in charge of disseminating knowledge. Back then it was such a critical job. Critical job. Yes, no internet, no books and, and, and, and the, the whole thing was, was that the whole emphasis was on transmit. The oral transmission had to take place without not one iota of change. It had to be transmitted from mouth to ear, unbroken without change, without alteration, which has always been the issue with human beings.

Speaker 1:          01:33:49       Hence that telephone game. You tell someone something, they tell you something, but if you start out in, you know it's going to be the same with native americans and the native american storytellers have to go through a very long arduous term of initiation to show that when they tell the story, it's going to be exactly like they heard it. That's one of the basis of modern freemasonry too. We need to get that with today's modern gossip. Yeah, we need to nail that, but let's just run through a quick succession here. If some of the most recent research shock synthesized hexagonal diamonds in younger dryas boundary sediments, whoa, now these shocks synthesized hexagonal diamonds only occur. There's no natural known natural process that will produce them except for the intense heat and pressures of a cosmic impact. Whoa. Okay. And what year was this study? Oh, this has been very recent.

Speaker 1:          01:34:44       This is probably within the last 10 years. there was some since 2007. This is probably around 2011. There was something that was released very recently about micro diamonds and micro diamonds correspond summer. Yeah, and that also was the same timeline, so it's just like the evidence keeps accumulating in this time period that something hit us. The micro diamonds, the nuclear glass spikes in warming. That's observable on the ice core correlates that mass extinction events of all these animals. This is an event. This is an event. Well, I. This is crazy that you're. You're the guy talking about this event. I mean this is really nuts, but not anything taken away from you, but there's so few people beating this drum that there's so much information. We're talking about hard data. You've shown on this show three, four different examples of hard data that points to this event.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       Well see, here's the thing. Modern science does tend to get over specialized and so what happens is the guy looking at extinctions might not be looking at, you know, glacial melting. The guy who is looking at glacial melting isn't, the geologist is not looking at what's going on in the sky, they're not looking at, you know, traditions from thousands of years ago. So what it does is because of the power of this specialization, specialization is extremely powerful, but he's shortcoming is that it's easy to miss the big picture. What that does is opens the door for generalists. Guys who are just people who are just say guys, men or women, anybody who's curious about this stuff, to look into it and try to see the big picture. Why am I bringing this? Well it's becAuse for 40 years I've been obsessed with this stuff and you know, I read two or three scientific articles every single day and have done so for 40 years plus.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       So that adds up after awhile and I don't just read them. I study, I might take notes, you know, two or three every single day. So you figure what is that? That's 2000 a year. You go back 40 years. That's means I probably read something on the order of 40,000 scientific articles from anthropology, geology when I studied geology and astronomy in college, so I have some academic background in that, but, but you know, basically what I have done is tried to piece together the big picture because early on I saw nobody's doing that. Nobody's doing it really, and some of the guys that are out there doing it are not doing it with academic rigor, you know, they're bringing in all kinds of weird stuff which makes it easy for the critics to attack them and dismiss them as fringe science. The throne, some wound to the mix.

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       They're throwing some wound to the mix. In fact, one of the, the, the rational wiki entry on me says something about randall carlson and he is woo and that's all it says. You know? So I took that. And so people love to be able to dismiss anything that's not mainstream. Right? It's outside. Yeah. Yeah. Because there's this cult of authority, you know, that's why you're here. Somebody says, well, what is a real scientists say about this? What is a real scientists say about this flood into my current role, which real scientists, you know, vic baker, richard, wait, uh, you know, roy breckinridge, you know, I've, I've read or talk to every, almost every scientist that's done work on the missoula flood, you know, so I know what they're saying and what they're thinking, you know, and what they've written it. So, so, you know, when you say, well, what are the real scientists say?

Speaker 1:          01:38:22       Well, okay, let's get a little more specific. Who are you talking about? Because there are different points of view, you know, are you talking about John Shaw idea? Are you talking about, you know, victor bakers ideas or, or, or any of the others? Well, you know, and that's the thing, they say that because they don't really know they've got this idea in your mind that there's this authority that's got it all explained, which makes it easy, right? Because if somebody got it explained, then we don't need to concern ourselves with it or think about it. Right? so what I say is, okay, forget about who says what. Let's just look at the facts that the facts dictate to us what the meaning of all of this is, you know, and let's look at all points of view because that's what I try to do. You know, I've got in my, in my archives here, I've got, you know, not only the research that supports the idea of a, of a cosmic impact back during the younger dryas, but to criticisms of it as well, you know, and I go, okay, how can we explain those criticisms and into give and take of science.

Speaker 1:          01:39:24       That's part of the process, you know, that's how it evolves because somebody puts out a new idea, you're supposed to attack it, you know, and then if it withstands the assault, the onslaught that shows that it's a credible idea, you know, it's like a last man standing sort of thing. And I think that the cosmic impact really is going to end up being the last man standing. Well, it seems like there's so much evidence that you're, you're, you're bringing up that's so hard. You know the, this, the, the, how do you say that word? Hca. Contract. Contract. Contract like mineral from black, matte, I mean all the, the, the, the various things, the micro diamonds, the nuclear glass, the mass extinction events, the evidence of uh, the loading, warming, the flooding, the c level, raw, all of it. All, all this burn area. Yeah. And this, this is basically st conrad chondrites are a type of media, right?

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       So this is saying, right, like material, in other words, material that would have had its origin in space from the black man. Now this black man is really interesting. I'm going to show you a couple of slides of it because this black matte layer, it's black. The reason it's black is because it's so loaded with what is the result of fire, right? So let's, let's go through here. This discovery of a nano diamond rich layer and the greenland ice sheet. So nobody had looked, but when these guys, richard firestone and James West and james candidate, these other scientists

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       that are working on this younger dryas impact hypothesis said to their colleagues, check out the younger dryas boundary layer 12,000, 900 years ago and see if there's anything that shows up there. They did, and what do you suppose they found here in his right here? A nano diamond rich layer. So there it is showing up in the ice sheets. Here's new evidence from a black math site into northern andy's supporting a cosmic impact. Twelve thousand, 800 years ago, a very high temperature impact melt products as evidence for cosmic airburst impacts 12,900. So they, you know, they haven't, they're getting closer and closer to refining the date, but it's coming in 12,800 to 12,900 years ago. Um, wildlife, wildfire and abrupt ecosystem disruption on california's northern channel islands at the aloe rod. Younger dryas boundary at basically 12,900. Twelve point nine k means 12,000, 900 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:41:57       It was the universal means a thousand. It's crazy. It's all the same. Everything keeps coming back the same date. Yeah. Nano diamond rich layer across three continents consistent with major cosmic impact at 12,800 calendar years before present. Evidence from central Mexico supporting the younger dryas, extraterrestrial impact hypothesis, evidence from northwestern venezuelan, andy's for extraterrestrial impact, the black mat, enigma evidence for deposition of 10 million. Tons of impact spiros across four continents. Twelve thousand, 800 years ago. See, it's coming in, man. It's coming in and abundance and what's gratifying to me as I theorized this 25 years ago. Wow. And it to see now the hard evidence coming in supporting a scenario I had pieced together from all of these different realms of knowledge is very gratifying to me. What was the seed in your mind that led you to be obsessed, for lack of a better word, with this anomaly thing? Lack of a better word. I think it's pretty accurate, right? With this subject. Okay. I guess iT's time to come clean. I was on mushrooms on top of a mountain. Well, no, you're actually pretty close.

Speaker 3:          01:43:17       Okay. Nineteen 69. That's a good year. Mushrooms. Well, wasn't mushrooms but it was something in the family. Okay. Okay. I'm going to a rock concert. Right? And the beautiful summer day, early summer 12. Twelve thousand 900 years ago. No, 19, 69, right. Okay. So it's. It's on a field next to a little airport in just out southwest of the twin cities, Minnesota, which was near where I grew up in the Minnesota river. Flows through there, right? Minnesota river flows into the Mississippi. I think I'll have some slides coming up here. I can maybe even show you. Okay. So what we have here is that in the middle of this thing, between bands or whatever, I wandered off from the main area where the, where the crowd was gathered to listen to the music and I walked over to these 200 foot high bluffs overlooking the valley of the missing of the Minnesota river.

Speaker 3:          01:44:22       Now the Minnesota river currently flows in a little channel at the bottom of this valley and I'm standing up on this hill and I'm looking down at this Minnesota river, you know, hundreds of feet below me in this channel and three miles, four miles across. I see another set of bluffs matching the ones that I'm standing on. And I had this. All I can say is this was kind of a revelation that I'm looking down here at this little river flowing into a channel and then I'm seeing just a gigantic version of that same channel, but it's three and four miles wide and I just looked at that and it was almost as if for a short period of time I got transplanted out of time or something. I don't know how to explain it. You can see this raging river had this sense that this whole thing was a gigantic river.

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       At one time. I came away from that with this idea planted in the back of my brain and it bugged me for years after that. Right, and it was maybe five, six years. This is now into the seventies. There was not a whole lot on catastrophism available in the seventies. There was, you know, a manual makowski, one of the forerunners, but you know, he, he came up with some really wild ideas that made it very easy for mainstream science to dismiss him, but he came up with some really solid ideas to his book. Earth and upheaval basically was just a documentation of all of this geological evidence for great catastrophes in the history of the earth. I think he misinterpreted the cause of those catastrophes. But nonetheless, when you look at the criticisms you've heard of the manual vela kosky, right? Fellow cops think I've heard it from you.

Speaker 3:          01:46:09       Okay. Well, he was famous bestselling author, one of the big best selling authors of the 19 fifties, you know, maybe in a sense a forerunner of, in fact, graham hancock has been compared to vela koskie now. And then I've actually seen some of some of that. Um, although vela [inaudible] work I don't think was anywhere near as credible as graham's. Graham is very, very assiduous in his, his referencing in his detailing. And so vela kosky went way off into this really weird astrophysics to explain his, his theories of geological catastrophe, which again allowed the critics to basically dismiss everything he had done so. But his book, earth and upheaval, I think has upheld the test of time. We were basically in the 19 fifties. He was accumulating all of this evidence suggesting that there had been catastrophes in earth history and what was it, like I said, a best seller, but the mainstream scientific community was very dismissive of it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:07       Okay. And then after that you had a book called, uh, uh, by charles hapgood called the path of the pole. I think it came out in [inaudible] 76 and he, he and near theorized that there had been a sudden shift that had brought about the quick freezing of the mammoths and the end of the ice age and so forth. Um, so I was familiar with that stuff and I would, I would read that stuff just out of curiosity, you know, um, because that was some of the stuff that was out there. And, and um, you know, somebody would say, hey, did you read the lukowski? And so as I was reading this stuff, I would keep thinking back to this image I'd had of this, you know. And then in early eighties I was talking to somebody, I actually gave one of my very early lectures on this stuff and there was somebody who had a degree in geology who stood up and he said, no, no, no, no, that, that valley that you're talking about, which created over millions of years.

Speaker 3:          01:48:00       I said, I don't think so. And we kind of got into it a little bit in, but what that did was it kind of pissed me off. And I said, okay, I'm going to research this thoroughly. And I did. I thoroughly researched it. I went and I found every single thing that had been written on it and discovered that there's actually mainstream geologists that have said, yeah, that river channel, that giant river channel was actually created by a huge meltwater flood. And they estimated that it's volume. They called it river warren. They estimated it as volume, might've been 4,000 times greater than the modern Minnesota river that's flowing in there. So I felt very vindicated from that. And this was by the early eighties. So that was like one of the key things. There was other things, you know, I um, I spent the summer of 1970 mostly sitting on a mountain top in Colorado, you know, in a hut that I had built studying and reading stuff and, and, and traveling.

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       I knoW this was back in the days when you could hitchhike and travel all over and I think at one point I was with a buddy and we were in his old camper van and other times I would teach anchor, but I spent the whole summer traveling around the western states. And the thing I came away from that summer with the. I'd traveled the first time I had traveled down to columbia gorge. And as I did, I had this overwhelming sense that there was something in the landscape that I was, that was, that was waiting to be revealed. I would look at these features in the columbia records when I showed you that huge waterfall with the basalt over and that's in the columbia gorge. So that was the area I had traveled through in 1970. And I came away with that with this sense, that point or something that, that landscape is trying to tell me. And so it goes back to that and I just, you know, I got very in this stuff

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       because I'm interested a in science and I love the outdoors. So I love a good mystery, you know, and I love, you know, ancient traditions were. So all this sort of came together over a period of a couple of decades. Um, so I began really, I would say obsessive lee really going into this in the early eighties, you know, where it went from, just more or less casual reading into, you know, spending hours in university libraries for digging up these things. Going back to the ninth, going back to the early geologists to see what were they saying, why did they believe that the history of the earth had been catastrophic, you know, and um, and it just accelerated. It doesn't seem like a ridiculous idea at all. When you consider what we see on the moon and the moon is so fascinating because we can look right at it.

Speaker 1:          01:50:41       There's no oceans, there's no forests. We can see the evidence of impacts all over it just completely covered, completely covered with our minds living in this very small window of life, you know, if we're lucky, we get 100 years and then of course we have the history which goes back to about seven plus thousand years. This is not enough to really to represent what we're looking at. When we look at the moon, we look at the moon that's covered with craters. We're looking at potentially billions of years of impacts. Yes. And, and the assumption that those impacts ceased hundreds of millions or billions of years ago is clearly not correct. Well, there's no evidence that seized or why it would cease. When we look at how many we known near earth objects are floating around. Oh, in the last few years there's been dozens of close flybys. That was one the other day that had a fucking moon.

Speaker 1:          01:51:37       Yes. Yes. So something that flew by that have its own moon. Yeah. Yeah. That's wild. And so think about this, joe. Here's what's happening. We've got geologists who are looking at the crust of the earth in discovering that, yeah, if we strip away the biosphere in the oceans and an account for plate tectonics, the earth is going to look like the moon. Right? Are noW hundreds of identified craters, right? At the same time, astronomers are looking out into the near space near the near earth neighborhood of space and discovering, wait a second, we assumed that we were pretty much isolated. There was nothing else going on. We're now realizing that near or spaces densely populated, the inner solar system is densely populated with cosmic debris and this stuff is western bias all the time and it's now at the same time. You've got paleontologists who are looking at the record of life and realizing that the record of life is not a smooth curve.

Speaker 1:          01:52:40       It seesawed, you know, life proliferates and then suddenly bam. It's like the hammer comes down and you have these mass extinction events, so this is our time right now, but it could very easily end. There could be some new bug like creature that takes over and become super smart a billion years from now. To me, it all comes down to this. This to me is like, okay, human species on planet earth, it's time for you to grow up and start paying attention to the bigger picture because whether you like it or not, you're a part of the bigger picture. And if we, if we finally accept the fact that maybe our predecessors have undergone in a sense, cultural mass extinctions, you know, it suddenly implies that we can't take our own unending future for granted that we have. We have to incorporate this bigger picture into our thinking.

Speaker 1:          01:53:32       and you know, the evidence has continues to yes. Like here, this was just from 2011 multiple lines of evidence for possible human population decline. Settlement reorganization during the early, younger dryas into three years, four years since this was published. More evidence has emerged that yes, the, the events that caused the mass extinction of half the great mega mammals on earth did not leave the rest of the mammals the rest of the animals unscathed, including humans. And there is now emerging evidence, hard scientific evidence that the human population crashed during the younger dryas. So this would completely coincide with graham hancock's ideas about the sphinx. Sphinx. Absolutely showing very clear, according to robert schoch, boston university geologists, John Anthony West, John Anthony West, that there is clear evidence of water erosion on the sphinx, which would indicate thousands of years of rainfall where there hasn't been rainfall in the nile valley since, I believe it was 9,000 bc.

Speaker 1:          01:54:44       So that's 11,000 years ago. It's all the same stuff. It's all the same stuff. God, this is crazy. Yeah, we're, we're, we're, we're on the verge of a major paradIgm shift and where it's going to go remains to be seen. We live in a shooting gallery. We live. We listened. it's not an exaggeration to say that we are sitting ducks in a cosmic shooting. Gail. Exactly. But the point is, here's the point, is the only thing that's see, it's like, what was it in the. In the book of matthew, there's an interesting quote, and I'm not, I'm not not thumping the bible here, but the bible is full of just like all the traditions of ages are gone. The bible is full of some very powerful, interesting stuff. There's a part in here and we're one of the disciples asked jesus about when are we going to know about the end of days?

Speaker 1:          01:55:35       And he says, well, as it was in the days of noah, when the people were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage. So will it be again in the days, the end of days when the flood comes, when the people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the flood came and swept them away. So will it be again at the end of days? So what that seems to indicate to me is that we just get comfortable and relaxed and do well. And when we do well, that's when you get hit. But it's not saying that the everyday stuff, the stuff of everyday life, there's anything wrong. It's not saying that, it's just saying if we get so preoccupied with the minutia and the trivia of everyday life to the exclusion of the bigger picture, that's when we open ourselves up with has been. I've had these weird coNversations with people about asteroidal impacts over the years because I've.

Speaker 1:          01:56:30       Before I even met you, I've been obsessed with this stuff. not nearly as much as when I met you in atlanta and we started talking then I got really into it. but would they would talk about the asteroids that killed the dinosaur. Oh, today we'd be able to stop that. And I'm like, okay, really? Is that true? And then I started looking into it. Well, what has been done is nothing. Some fucking theories. See here, here's the thing. Potentially yes we could. Someday we could do it. And, and really, you know, within, within a decade or two. Yes we could. We could do that right now potentially. But see what happened on February 15th of 2014 when that little meatier came in and exploded over chelyabinsk siberia injured 1500 people now in damaged thousands of buildings. That was a wake up call, right? That was a little suspect.

Speaker 1:          01:57:20       it was a little speck. Now here's the thing, if he had been a little bigger, a little dancer, if it's an angle of approach, had been a little steeper. If it's velocity had been a little bit greater, we might've been looking at thousands of deaths rather than just injuries and tunguska, as you said, only 150 foot wide. Only 150 foot wide objeCt. Right, right. So that's very, very small in the cosmic sense. This room. Yeah. Well it's the building from here to the front door, you knoW what I mean? That's not that big. It's not that big. Once you've got though is velocity and you think like, you know, think of a say a 38 slug. It's not big. If I was to throw it at you, even as hard as I could, it might sting a little bit, but it wouldn't do any damage, but if it came out of a gun with a muzzle velocity of a thousand feet per second, think about that little thing and what the damage it would do to you and see. That's the thing about an asteroid or meteorite or a comet coming in. It's moving really, really fast. You know, so that's why, like I said, it packs such a powerful kinetic punch when it hits and some of them are even made of iron. Some of them are made of iron and so. So if, if there's, if there's a moral dollar this, it's simply this look, we are the one species that could prevent the type of mass

Speaker 3:          01:58:41       extinctions that have dominated the biosphere of this planet for a couple of hundred million years. Or we could keep putting our resources to fracking. Yeah. Well, I still haven't made up my mind about fracking yet, but I do believe that what we need to do is be thinking of, if we're going to extract the resources of this planet, let's do so in such a way that what we're doing is implementing the transcendence of human culture into the cosmos itself, because I ultimately believe that is the destiny of terrestrial life is the terrestrial life wants to become cosmic. It knows on some level that as long as life, it's confined to the surface of a planet. It's vulnerable. Right? And, and you know, without getting into all of this, there's, there's growing evidence that life originally came to this planet from space, right? Was seated here probably through comets that carry organic material.

Speaker 3:          01:59:39       All been. Spare me her hand sperm. Yeah, exactly. So here's the thing, if you're an environmentalist and rightfully critical of some of the things that humans are doing to disrupt the environment you got to the place in context, the fact that nature itself has done things to the environment so that so far exceed anything we have done yet what I showed you with that slide, showing the ice sheets over candidate. Think about this. Suppose some logging company got a contract from the government, us and canadian governments to clear cut every forest from like the 47th parallel up to the arctic circle from the atlantic to the pacific. We're going to cut every single tree from the northern United States up to the tree line in, in northern Canada. We're going to cut billions of trees, billions of board feet. we're going to clear cut every single tree.

Speaker 3:          02:00:34       We would rightfully be up in arms and say, no, you're not going to do that. Right? well, what do you think that ice did? It wiped out. You know, there's evidence now that 35 and 40,000 years ago, there were forests growing up there, right? A few thousand years later, the ice has bulldozed everything. There's no forest growing under two miles of ice, right? Imagine if we said, well, we're going to just decimate the shallow marine ecology. We're going to go in there and we're going to just wiPe out the coral reefs were going to overfish them till there's no nothing, nothing left of the shallow marine ecology. Ecology is less than 400 feet below sea level. What do you think are dropping 400 feet, 400 feet in the c level did to the shallow marine ecologies to the coral reefs that were growing there. You see, that's where I'm just saying it's not to justify that we can ransacked nature willy nilly, but it's to say we have to have a realistic context for thinking about this and bear in mind that the environmental movement was born during an era of total

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       gradual listic dominance in the fifties and sixties. If you go back down again, only the fringe, the, the, the, you know, the, the, the, the fringe science people like vela kowski and others were talking about catastrophes. The assumption was is that all global change occurred one grain of sand or one drop of water at a time, right? Well, we've come a hundred 80 degrees from that model of earth history, but our thinking has not really evolved to, to, to incorporate such a dynamic planet. You knoW, at this point. Now see, so when the environmental movement was born, it was easy to think that if, if all change, it had happened at this imperceptibly slow rate. Obviously didn't humans have accelerated that pace of change and humans are now contributing to know more global change than, than we've seen in millions of years. If that uniformitarian undergraduate holistic model was correct, but it's not.

Speaker 1:          02:02:39       And I'm afraid that thEre's a large faction of the environmental movement that's still locked into that thinking of a gradual evolution of the planet. One grain of water, one drop of water, one grain of sand at a time, and that it has not suffered any kind of disruption until we bad humans came along and started, you know, with our factories and our oil wells and our movies and everything else. But you know, clearly we have to come to terms with the fact that we live on one hell of a dynamic planet in one hell of a dynamic solar system was a hell of a dying without jupiter. Right. We'd be fucked a long time. We would be. Somebody said they wanted to hear me say the word fuck at least once.

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       So I'll throw out. Go ahead and throw it. Yeah, we would be fucked. Jupiter is the big, kind of like the bouncer for all the bigger asteroids that get sucked into jupiter can play a dual role. See jupiter connect as a as. Yeah, the bouncer that it kicks a lot of those guys back out, back out into the kuyper disk or wherever they came from or from. But it can also hurdle stuff in towards us. It can do either one. Sacred geometry is a subject that I wanted to talk to you about because we. We could go on about cataclysmic impacts forever, but it's one of the things that you mentioned at the end of our last podcast that you wanted to talk about on this one and it's the name of your organization. Sacred geometry. Well, it's the name of the website. Yeah. I could find some stuff here to show you about that. And, and it dovetails because bayer, remember we're talking here a lot about geology, geometry, right? They both are sciences that have evolved out of the study of the earth. And uh, you know, one of the things that I've done is, is in geology. We have this thing called scale and variance, which is that if you're looking a geological picture,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       you're always gonna. See somebody you're going to see like a rock pick set in the picture, you're going to see a person standing there because oftentimes you don't have a sense of the scale of what you're looking at. Right? If, and in geometry we have the same phenomena. It's also kind of the modern term for it is fractal association where the part looks, the smaller part looks like the bigger whole. And that's one of the basic working ideas of sacred geometry and it's the same idea of what I was describing standing there looking into the Minnesota river valley. This was an example of scale in variance that you had the same, that the big channel was just a much, much larger version of this small channel. And if you didn't have a scale of reference, you couldn't tell really what you're looking at, how, how big or how small it is.

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       See. So in the study of sacred geometry, one of the fundamental ideas is this idea of scale and variance. So when I first was interested in geometry, because geometry I think is one of the keys to decipher in many of the ancient traditions. LIke you know, I became a. Somebody wanted me to talk about freemasonry and I can talk about that up to a certain extent. You know, one of the things that I learned as soon as I actually, I think I learned it before I was actually initiated into the masonic fraternity in 1978 was that at the core of all of the masonic symbolism was geometry. If you wanted to understand the message of the great cathedrals, you had to have geometry. If you wanted to understand the, the, the, the, this amazing plethora of symbolism that has of which masons are the custodians. You had to study geometry and secondarily you had to study astronomy, so that sort of confirmed some of the ideas I had already been thinking at the time that I went in in the, in the late seventies.

Speaker 3:          02:06:31       Freemasonry is full of symbolism. Why did you join the freemasons? Well know, because for one thing, I've always loved you. I come from a family of builders. I build things for a living. That's what I do. I design things and build things for a living. That's what I. How I make my money. So I was always interested in the built environment and somewhere along the line I just began to realize that there was a whole lot more to the built environment of ancient times that in modern times you look at architecture in that architecture is not necessarily symbolical except on a very abstract sense. I became aware of the fact that the ancient architecture, the ancient structures, whether it's the pyramids of giza or stonehenge or angkor wat, are the mayan temples. There are all profoundly symbolic. They're not just built because, hey, it looks good. No, it's, they convey information. um, you know, cathedrals. It was victor hugo who, who referred to some of the great cathedrals as being literal textbooks in stone and that's what they are. Sharp cathedral,

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       beautiful example of a textbook and stone. And, and uh, I have, I don't know if you've ever been to any of the cathedral that that's something you need to put on your bucket list. Joe. I'm planning on going to europe this summer, so when I do on a vacation instead of working. Yeah, that's. Yeah, make it a research vacation. It will make a lot more interesting. And maria, go have kids. It's tough to do a lot of research. We've got little kids get bored real easy, but I'm going to check some shit out. Checks and shit out, you know, and I can send you some places that I don't know about your kids, but I could easily have been eight years old and been totally blown away by. Well, one of the things about the freemasons, the idea of the free masons is that it's a secret society and this a secret, you know, and people associated with the illuminati and the people that control the world and don't.

Speaker 1:          02:08:29       I wish. But no, I think I would love to be the dick, dick supreme dictator of the world. Really. Why would you do differently? Differently? We could get into. That's going to be, yeah, that's a five hour body, but that's a different podcast. But the. But when you say like I'm a mason, people would automatically, you know, especially ignorant people would automatically assume that you're a part of some sort of society that's victimizing the general population and you're involved with the people that put the eyeball on top of the pyramid that's on the dollar bill and your, you know, I don't even know where to start with some of that. Are there secrets in the freemasons where you're not allowed to talk about it? Well, bear in mind now secrets in in the middle ages, there were trade secrets and building secrets. Clearly, you know, and when you went through the process of initiation, you learned about these secrets, right?

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       But it's not that really that different. The idea than say modern commercial or industrial secrets, you know, coke has, it keeps it formula secret. Right? Right. And has done so for 100 years. But the thing was is you got to realize that freemasonry became an outlawed organization right during the middle ages when the church was persecuting anybody who was branded a heretic, which could have meant anything that they wanted to be free. Masonry had to go underground. And that's the primary reason for the secrecy is because it was a survival strategy and it only reemerged in nearly 1700 with the consolidation of four lodges in britain to become the modern institution freemason. And you know, to anybody who comes up with that, I would just challenge him, show me the hard evidence, show me that, you know, I like to say that. Well, yeah, I'll admit, you know, 14 of the american presidents have been free masons, but 22 of them were episcopalians. So clearly that implies me that it's the episcopalians

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       who are the puppet masters ruling the world, right? If you want to make that argument, well why were they freemasons? Like, what's the benefits of being a freemason? Well, for one thing, what you're doing is you're aligning yourself with probably the oldest institution. It still exists on the planet that goes back. Now we can historically trace it back to the middle ages. But if you go back further than that wild, the historical continuity breaks down. We can go back and we can talk about the coma. Chines and Italy. We can talk about the martin lists, we can talk about the, um, the myth reyes tradition. we can talk about the mysteries of Egypt. Uh, we can talk about the, the zoroastrian tradition. Um, the list goes on, the loc and mysteries. And what we see is a structure of initiation, it's virtually identical in all these cases to what modern freemasonry is.

Speaker 3:          02:11:27       And I'm with modern freemasonry basically, you know, you have a whole cross section of individuals that join who, who a lot of them joined simply because, hey, my dad was a freemason, or my uncle, it was a family tradition. So that's why I joined. Others joined because free masons raised every year, raised millions of dollars for charity, mostly for children's, a charitable causes, you know, they run the scottish rite hospital for crippled children. They run I hospitals and you know, children that need medical care, they can go to these hospitals and not have to pay anything. So they're fraternal organization or one of the largest charitable organizations on the planet in terms of the money that they raised. You know, again, jesus said by their, by their works, you shall know them. You know, um, you know, you can twist that around, perversely, twist that around and say that some kind of nefarious strategy to, you know, whatever, get control.

Speaker 3:          02:12:24       The other side of the equation is that they're also custodians of this body of ancient symbolism were all of these things that we have been talking about basically are encoded. Um, and, and, and I could pull up some interesting stuff here. Did you know that you could look at to see what we're actually talking about there? But, but yeah, they have this amazing body of symbolism. Let me, let me pull it. Here's how big an example of a masonic apron. Okay, let's take a look at this. we'll zoom in here. And what do you see right at the very center of this symbol? Symbolical array. What do you, what is that? I think it's a barn. It's not a bar of the ark, the ark, it's, you know, it's probably a noah's ark of noah's ark. So that's the. So that's supposed to be the ocean around it and it's floating in the waters of the great flood. And, and if you look closely, I know it's hard to tell, but growing out of here, that's a chicken. What's an acacia? The acacia has impatient bush, a masonic symbol for rebirth regeneration, rejuvenation.

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       So the idea here is that iN that arch is preserved all of the seeds, the bIological diversity of the world that is now being erased from the planet by the waters of the flood, the acacia. Is it related to the acacia tree or the case of bushes at the same sort of thing? Yeah. You know, that's the same bush that they believe was responsible for moses having the visions of god. So what are they giving him the 10 commandments because the acacia bushes rich and dimethyltryptamine. Ah, the flaming bush, the being symbolic of somehow or another extracting the dmt from that, smoking it or lighting it on fire. And that being the transmission method for the dimethyltryptamine, which of course is one of the most profound psychedelic experiences and gives people this feeling of being in contact with the divine. Now, do you think it's any coincidence that the freemasons have venerated the acacia for hundreds of years?

Speaker 4:          02:14:29       It makes a lot of sense. Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's modern day scholars who are looking at the story of moses and connecting it to some sort of a psychedelic trip. Yeah. Here is, which is another thing that's slowly being exonerated today. Those ideas are being vindicated today. Yeah, way that before, you know, you would say just a few decades ago that somehow or another moses was on drugs and I'm like, get the fuck out of here. Yeah. I think people would just. And any real, legitimate sort of stories being connected to psychedelic drugs, people would think of as being preposterous and now and now worn more accepted every day simply because the evidence has accumulated overwhelming the elephant there. There's no question that in the llc and mysteries, they were imbibing some type of a consciousness altering substance. I think that there's no question during the mithraic mysteries also.

Speaker 4:          02:15:21       They were, they don't know what that was though, right? Not exactly. Unless you, you know, I think, um, who was it? Maybe Albert Hoffman and a couple others, they, they, they wrote a book in the seventies on the loc and mysteries where they were talking about that. And I read it so long ago, I've kind of forgotten what their, what their final conclusion was, but it was definitely that they were doing some type of a psychedelic potion will even soma. When you go back to the ancient hindus, the soma being some sort of a mystery concoction, they don't know what it was, but most likely had some sort of psychedelic properties to. I don't know what it was. They don't know exactly what. It was amazing when you consider the fact that this stuff was so profound, so important to them, and now we don't even know what was in it and most likely some concoction with probably included psychedelic mushrooms.

Speaker 4:          02:16:14       Yeah. Well I'm convinced that one of the, one of the great boons to humankind is psychedelics. And it was a profound mistake to criminalize it when we should have venerated as ancient cultures did and provided a context in which people could do it with wisdom, you know, and propriety rather than driving it underground, you know, and turning it into a criminal enterprise that has been, I think enormously had enormously destructive consequences for our society by, by criminalizing this for the last half century. Yeah, most certainly. And you can see the difference in the art of the 19 sixties, especially when it comes to music, the difference between the sixties and the seventies, that shallow nature of a lot of the music that came out of the seven days in the disco and all that stuff. And then look at what was going on in the sixties with hendrix and jim morrison, most likely psychedelic related.

Speaker 4:          02:17:04       Oh, of course it was. Yeah, of course. Led zeppelin, the beatles. The profound change in the music of the beatles. once they discovered lsd, it inspired an enormous burst of creativity. It's really interesting. Then what we're seeing now is huge benefits in psychedelic therapy for people with posttraumatic stress disorder, ice. And it's out of war that we're finding these therapies for people that went to war and these therapies, the best ones are psychedelics, which is really amazing. Well, you know, in my own case, you know, I basically went from being a juvenile delinquent to the quest for god in one weekend after my first basically. So wow It was that, that quick. A lot of people have at the same story. I mean, terence mckenna spoke of his, uh, one of his trips to the jungle, being that he was this sort of narrative, well, just couldn't get it together.

Speaker 4:          02:18:02       and then he came out of it, the psychedelic shaman. I had this intense desire to spread the word. yeah. Yeah. Yep. So, yeah, and I think we're definitely moving in the right direction. I just, it's of course, you know, for me, I'm impatient. I want to see you move a lot faster. I want to see us just end this ridiculous drug war, you know? And, and yeah, of course there's going to be a downside to it. There's downsides to everything, you know. and, but the upside is so substantial. Upside is so substantial. And the downside of it is minuscule compared to the downside of the drug war itself. Not only that, how about the drugs that we already have that are legal to the drugs that are sanctioned or the worst one? Worst ones. yeah. Just we're not going to have a drug free society.

Speaker 4:          02:18:48       I've had Dr. Carl Hart on the podcast who's an expert in this and is written some pretty amazing stuff on it and one of the things he said is not only do we not want a drug free culture, we've never had one. No one has ever had an idea of a drug free culture. They've never existed. Once people figured out a way to perturb their normal states of conscious and the benefits of that, whether it's alcohol or psychedelics or whatever it's been. Even yoga and meditation, you're essentially, you're, you're, you're stimulating indogenous drugs. Yes. Yes. And, and, and see, here's the thing. Somebody brought this up. I don't remember who. It might've been somebody like richard or something back

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       in the day saying, you know, you can go. You can embark on a quest for spiritual enlightenment in and mystical at one moment, right through through this arduous program of yoga and meditation and in, in all of that, and it'll take you years, but who is going to embark upon such a program? Not really knowing that the end of it is this ecstatic, mystical union with the god had. Right? Well, they said it basically. Nature's provided shortcuts so that you know, we could actually see what the goal of it was and know that, yeah, at the end of this process that might take you 10 years or five years or whatever, depending on your dedication. There is this all this experience of your consciousness expanding into these ecstatic states agents of evolution as it were, and that's the thing that people, I think universally feel from psychedelic experiences, is that it allows you to get over a lot of these sort of built in instincts that we have from our thousands of years of evolution and the the time that we were essentially living like wild animals.

Speaker 1:          02:20:40       those, those genes are still in our system and we have all these ideas of paranoia. And fear and ego and jealousy and all these different things that allowed us to be ultra competitive, which allowed us to innovate at a faster rate, which allowed us to get to where we are in 2015. But those things are kind of hampering us because we were outgrowing the monkey body. It's like, you know, if we're going to travel to um, we wanted to travel to europe, right? You can't drive there in a car, you can go drive from here to the east coast. But once you get to the coastline, you have to get out of the car and get into a different vehicle, right? Because if you keep driving in the same car, you're going to go into the ocean and you're going to drown. Right? We're kind of liked that in the sense that, you know, see, I think that war was perhaps inevitable.

Speaker 1:          02:21:30       You know this because it's embedded in our consciousness. You see, I just showed you hear evidence that the human population crashed coming out of the younger dryas. Well, what's ironic is that after the, after the ice age was over for about three or 4,000 years from 6,000 to about 9,000, 9,500 years ago, what we had was a period known as the climatic optimum by the scientists who have looked at it in which some of the estimates are that Global average climate might've been two to four degrees warmer than now. What that meant was that you had a much longer growing season and anybody who doubts is please do your own research or I can post all kinds of stuff online that anybody who's not immediately, you know, can't handle this. This can kind of information. Anybody who's open minded can actually go and do their homework and see that the climate climatic is well

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       documented and for about three to 4,000 years basically we were living in an almost quasi parodies iol state. Almost a garden of eden. Like it was almost like after their traumatic birth of this modern age. The holocene that we're in. It's like nature just sort of was this nurturing environment. It was during this period that humans were worshiping. The earth in the form of this corpulent pregnant goddess, right? It's been called the goddess civilization by maria gimbutas, who was the archaeologist who did all of this work. And what was interesting, if you look into her work, is that during this period of the, of the early neolithic in the archaeological terminology, there is no evidence of any warfare. There's no evidence that people are looking at, at the, the, the, the, the carvings that people did, that the artwork that people did, looking at the communities, there were not stockades like there were later.

Speaker 3:          02:23:25       There was no evidence in the, in the archaeological record of weaponization. And it makes sense because in the aftermath of this extreme event that ended the ice age, which you had was huge areas of the planet that were depopulated nature quickly begins to reclaim. And what you now have is you have this sort of, this benign warmth. We're growing seasons are months longer than now, you know, farming 14, 1500 feet higher in the mountains than is now possible. Um, you know, uh, you know, long, longer growing seasons and rapid expansion of population during this era. This would have been the era, you know, think about what would the biblical injunction that you always gave to adam and eve, what did he say? Be fruitful and multiply, replenish the earth, and subdue it. Be fruitful and multiply. Well. If you've got a species hovering on the brink of extinction, what's the most important thing that that species can do?

Speaker 3:          02:24:31       Lots of sex, lots of reproduction, right? In the context of those times, it would've been very important for people to have lots of sex too quickly, reestablish the viability of the human species because we were literally at now appears hovering on the brink of extinction. As were so many of the other large mammals of the planet, right and nature gave us this interval, this window, three or 4,000 years of extremely mild climate, right. During this time, human population rapidly expanded and moved into these vacated habitats. Around 6,000 years ago, the climate shifted. What started was has been called by the paleoclimatologists, the neo glaciation because the planet cooled a couple of degrees. What happened? Agricultural habitats contracted. The growing the, the, the, the elevation of viable agriculture came down. Okay, now if you've got settled human communities that have become well established and living, uh, in the context of that environment and now suddenly that environment changes, right?

Speaker 3:          02:25:46       Exactly. Coincident with those environmental changes around 6,000 years ago is when we see the first appearance of human conflict because now with this changing climate, you've got this disruption is major disruption in human communities that have been well established and proliferating for three or 4,000 years. Think about, you know, if you're living in a community in your farming at 10,000 feet above sea level, a smaller example, a micro example would be the freezing out of the, of the greenland colonists with the onset of the little ice age, right? For 500 years they were able to farm on the west coast of greenland and then the little ice age came on and they were frozen out and they tried to hang on as long as they could, but it kept getting harder and harder to grow crops. And then the climate declined further and the cis began to move south.

Speaker 3:          02:26:37       And the one who waited too long lost their opportunity. Because once the cia said moved south at cutoff the lanes so that they could actually evacuate greenland colonies completely went extinct. Iceland itself was almost completely depopulated during this. If we take that scenario, expand it, and go back 6,000 years ago, we essentially see a very similar parallel phenomena going on, and so when you figure for during it a civilization age of the goddess, this, this time that people were worshiping the earth in the form of this corpulent pregnant goddess, this benign, motherly, nurturing goddess, there was no reason for conflict because human populations were small, they were isolated. Resource base was enormous, and then with the climate change, what happened suddenly, now human communities and populations are disrupted. Migrations began happening. One group conflicts with another group, and now we see the implements and the evidence of warfare.

Speaker 3:          02:27:39       If we go back to 10,000, 12,000 years ago, clearly whatever happened then must have been profoundly traumatic to the survivors. Think about this. If you were the survivor of an event that basically erased modern civilization and you were living in a small, isolated banda survivors with no way to communicate with the rest of the world and no knowledge of whether there was even other survivors anywhere on the earth, it could profoundly affect your, your, your, your consciousness, and that could be so profound that it's the imprint of those events could be so profound that it could be passed on for generations and and be lodged in our subconscious. This idea of human conflict necessary for human survival into traumas that had been visited upon our species by nature itself. So I think that once we come to terms with the possibly origins of only until we come to terms with the origin of human conflict, are we going to be able to purge it once and for all and and realize that that the modern analog for that scenario was that coming out of that catastrophe.

Speaker 3:          02:28:53       Abundant resources, abundance, habitat, abundant space, no conflict for territory or resources because the human population was limited. What I suggest is that if people want to understand the future of the human species, go out on a crystal clear night and look at sky. There is the future. There's our potential future because the scenario is that had been around since the 1970 [inaudible] show that everything that we're extracting now from the earth, the minerals, the precious metals, the hydrocarbons, it's all out there in infinite abundance and it's basically just outside of our doorstep and we are as close now to being able to harvest the resources of the cosmic environment as we were from setting foot on the moon in 1960. Do you think we've been visited before by something from other planets? I think perhaps long, long ago maybe, but there's another scenario there that has been overlooked In all of the discussions about ufo is an aliens and at some point we'll talk about that some point. Yeah. You tease.

Speaker 3:          02:30:07       Well, you know, it's the kind of thing where you kind of need to lay out the case in, in, in what I like to do is basically present the evidence and see if whoever then draws the same conclusions from that evidence that I have. So. Okay. Let me, let me put it to you this way in what we were talking about at the very beginning of this interview and in talking about 7,000 generations of people and and the fact that in four or five generations we went from horseback to rocket ships. How many times in the last 7,000 years do you suppose that we could have done that? To me, it's not implausible that we could have achieved flight, even interest in interplanetary flight more than once. Just as we have. I guess. Think about it, we have, we have achieved interplanetary flight even though only manned expeditions to, to near space, but we're sending our satellites out beyond the solar system. All of this has come about in my lifetime, right? Totally. In my life. Tall since the 1958. My grandfather, when he was a kid, you know it was horses and a big point is that if we died off now, if there's some sort of mass extinction event, there'd be very

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       little evidence of this space travel, thousands of. There'll be no evidence. All the aluminum, all the stuff that the rockets out of it would all be gone, right? The earth would aBsorb it. Now, let's just consider as a wild, outrageous working hypothesis that humans have been able to offload from the planet prior to that prior to the modern space age. So at one point in time we went to mars, there's probably somewhere a little closer than that. It would've made sense like the moon, like the moon, like we've been able to establish a base on the moon. Yeah. Now this isn't. Like I said, great. This is an outrageous heretic. I'm what else? You've done drugs, man. This is over. It's time to lock me away. Gag me, muslim me. In life, we consider the fact that our civilization, you know, if all your theories are true, which they most certainly appear to be, our civilization has been rebooted as of 12,000 years ago.

Speaker 4:          02:32:24       Modern civilization emerges somewhere around 70,000 years ago and four point 6 billion years of life on earth, or excuse me, of the life of the earth, the earth, existing, and then life on earth being, you know, in our form what few hundred thousand years, right? In 100,000 years is all, oh, time. That's 10, 10 events since the big impact 10 times. But remember the greenland ice core graft and they showed you, I mean, what you're seeing there is a dozen or more enormous events in the last quarter, million years into time. Probably the human getting the oldest human skeleton, modern modern humans. Skeleton is now dated to about 180,000 years. How much earlier than that? Where we, I don't know, but conservatively we can say 180,000 years at greenland ice core grafted, I showed you, it goes back 250,000. So the rig veda stories of the amanas and the flying crafts and all that could actually have been based on real live objects, real live spaceships that someone read the sumerian stories.

Speaker 4:          02:33:30       What did they say in the wake of the flood? It was so disastrous that what did the gods do? They fled the earth and went to space. It says right there in the myth itself, since they left, they went, when they left the earth and went to the heavens because what was going on on your earth was so traumatic. It even freaked them out. Read the story, the gods, the gods, hanky and ian and nunan, nerc, don and the rest of. What did you think of zechariah situation and is fantastical translations of the sumerian texts dubious about some of his most are right? most people who are experts in the sumerian cuneiform. Yeah. I think that he was kind of cuckoo. Cuckoo, cuckoo. Well, but what's fascinating is there's so much that they absolutely understood that's really confusing. Like they understood they had an ad, an accurate depiction of our solar system, which included pluto, which included all the planets and all the orbit in, in, in the correct, you know, relatively correct sizes on these clay tablets that they made nine thousand seven thousand dollars, who knows how many thousand years ago, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:34:42       Yeah. I guess I'm, I read some kitcheN and stuff years and years ago and at the time took it with a grain of salt and subsequent to that, you know, after I've seen some of the critiques of him, you know, I'm kind of in that category myself. I'm thinking because he's, you know, his, some of his translations are, are dubious. He made some leaps. Sure. But what they did discover what they have just, it's so fascinating to me when you look at like the caduceus, which very clearly resembles the double helix of dna and how it's closely associated with some of these images of larger beings holding little smaller people with tails. Like what the fuck is that? Like this idea of genetic engineering, of taking lower primates and introducing human or alien dna into these lower primates to create modern humans. I don't know what to think about that.

Speaker 4:          02:35:36       It sounds ridiculous, but if we found a planet like let's say we exist in this state right now, and uh, we, uh, we evolve without getting hit in the head by a big rock from space for another thousand years or another 10,000 years. Let's get really fucking crazy. Just imagine how far we could come if we don't blow ourselves up. We don't. Yellowstone doesn't explode. We live another 10,000 years and we jet off into the cosmos and find some planet with a bunch of dumb monkeys on it. You don't think we would splice our dna into those dumb monkeys just to say, listen, I think you guys could do better. You could be like us. We're going to give you a little bump. We know what's coming. If you guys keep going along this way, you could get to where we are in the million plus years. Weakened a little injection maybe.

Speaker 4:          02:36:25       How about a scenario like this? Okay, well from our superior perspective, we know that you guys down here are living on a vulnerable planet that's going to be habits to ask kicked every so often, so we're going to do something to accelerate your evolution a bit so that perhaps you can become a little bit more intelligent and figure this out. We're going to leave some clues behind for you and then we're going to leave it in your hands to basically redeem to redeem the planet. It's amazing how often people just like completely dismissed any ideas like that, but yet we clearly are. We're very advanced in compared to life on earth, but clearly we're advancing into the solar system at the very least with robots. You know, we, we haven't really been doing man space trips

Speaker 1:          02:37:15       anymore, but we're sending a lot of fucking robots. Yeah, we're sending satellites, we're sending all these things to go around other planets and take images. Were sending robots that land on mars to rove around and take photos and soil samples and send information back through the sky to earth. I mean, that's pretty. It is fantastic stuff. Well, imagine if you tried to describe to this this to somebody 100 years ago, they'd go get outta here. This is outrageous. I don't even want to hear such ridiculous, but like you just said, considering the pace of change over the last century, you know, given us a century ago, there was no airline industry, but of course the thing was if you know, if you had the government bureaucracies like you like you have now back then orville and wilbur would have never been able to test their flights because some government bureaucrat would have been out there saying you don't have the proper permits to do this.

Speaker 1:          02:38:12       And right now that's, You know, one of the big obstacles is that we've gotten. We've got these top heavy political systems that are really, I think really encumbering the creative process, the evolutionary process. That's why I'm such a big supporter of, of basically freedom in getting back to the idea of, of individual liberty. Because think the upside of people being free. Yeah, of course there's a cost to freedom and there's going to be a downside to it. But the upside, I think, again, is so much greater than the downside that led to what the internet is showing the internet is. It represents freedom. The free, the ability to freely distribute information. This show itself would have never existed. This podcast could not have existed without something like the internet. No one would have ever given me a show. no one would ever like said, yeah, go talk to this guy from Georgia for three hours about asteroid impacts.

Speaker 1:          02:39:07       People will like it, you know, get outta here. Get the fuck out of here. Actually, I'm from Minnesota. Well, I mean you live there, you know. but it's just the whole idea is that freedom allows people to innovate at a much quicker pace. It allows negative things too. But so does life itself. there's, there's more of a chance of negative things. If things are controlled, if things are locked down and innovation goes, where does it goes right out in my own personal sphere, like 20 years, like I'm building a project right now in atlanta. Took me six months and nine trips down to city hall to get permission from the bureaucrats to do a small project, which 20 years ago I could have gotten permission in an hour to 20 years before that I didn't even would have been, would not have even needed permission from anybody, you know, oh, you've got your own house, you want to do this, your neighbors don't care. We'll do it. See, so this is what my experience there. Multiply that by millions across the board, you know, it's like, you know, it's going to get to the point where, you know, can we, do

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       we dare breathe out without a permit because we're exhaling carbon dioxide, you know? Right. So, um, yeah, I just, I, I think that a couple of things need to happen. One, we need to really get back to the idea and America, that's the great dream and vision of America was that this was supposed to be the home of freedom on planet earth. your bureaucracy is pretty disgusting, but it's also, I feel like sometimes we need some resistance in order to facilitate action. Some resistance. Yeah. And some resistance. Sometimes gives us this real desire to overcome that resistance, which makes innovation. Yeah, you know, and that might be one of the things that we're experiencing with this new culture that's emerging from the internet. It's kind of emerging in response to the resistance that we received from mean going back to psychedelics from the sixties and seventies, seventies into the eighties and the nineties.

Speaker 4:          02:41:11       The internet emerges and the internet is causing this big pushback on all of the archaic ideas of being promoted during those dark decades. Yeah, and I totally agree with you. I mean without some resist. I mean, after all, I mean if there's no resistance, you know, we. We're going to basically turn it into slugs. We turned the couch, potatoes, we turned the couch with the lazy. We're lazy. Yeah. It's very rare that human beings by default are ambitious. It's like in response to something like one of the worst things you could do to a kid is give the kid everything they want and not have them work. Though they'd never develop any instincts to work towards things. They never develop any, any instincts to recognize that there's a benefit to struggling and being uncomfortable and that the rewards when, when you have a hard day's work and a job completed, that you feel satisfied, but then the beer tastes so much better, so much better.

Speaker 4:          02:42:09       The jewish cabela's have a term for that, which I can't remember, but it translates as the bread of shame and it's like the bread of shame is the bread you get that you didn't really have to work for. You didn't have to struggle, you didn't have to put forward any effort. It's just given to you, you know, and, and, and, you know, it's like one of the, the stories that kind of goes along with presenting that as, you know, the, the, the man who builds up this great business empire, you know, and then you know, he's getting ready to retire and he wants to pass it onto his son and he says, you know, come in and I'm going to make you ceo of my business empire in the hole. You're going to be Able to run the whole thing. And the son says, no, thanks. I don't want, and he goes, well, what do you mean? He says, well, let me start at the bottom and work my way up and earn that position and it's going to mean a whole lot more to me and I'm going to be a hell of a lot more effective in that position and if it's just dumped in my lap. It's just so rare that anybody has that mentality though most people would take the easy road every single time. Well, and that is to the consternation, I think of our who didn't look at it

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       that way. You know the people that came across the ocean, it great hardship, didn't look at it that way and I think that they would be pretty much rolling in their graves if they could see. You know what's basically, oh well we'll let you. We'll just let the government take care of us. I don't have to get a job because the government's going to take care of us, but they would also look at our computers and go, holy shit, you guys have figured some thIngs out. God. Wait a minute, hold on. You asked a question to your phone and it gives you the answer. I mean, they never even thought about that on star trek and and see what that does is it shows there's 30 these parallel trends that are, that are happening, you know, so yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, that's why I tend to be more optimistic.

Speaker 1:          02:43:52       I'm not a pessimist. I, I have great hopes for her future. I do too. And people give me a hard time for it. Sometimes you think I'm unrealistic or the hippie side of me. Hippie ideology as well. The sacred geometry, sacred geometry name. Like why did you choose that as the name for your website? Well, because at the time I was looking at there was so much interest and because I saw it as a venue for putting information out there about that and showing some of the amazing correlations and linkages between the subject of geometry and so many of these other things. like I said, you know, the mayan temples, egyptian structures in helping, using that as a key to decipher or decode these messages that have been have been embodied in architecture. It's the key. It's a master, it's one of the master keys to decoding the archaic, true wisdom tradition.

Speaker 1:          02:44:49       There's no question and geometry pervades everything. I mean geometry pervades, you know, we can actually, I can show you now studies that have shown that the exact architecture of the solar system, if you change it even a little Bit, none of this could happen, you know, because as it is now, you have this great reservoir of comments outside the orbit of neptune called the kuyper disk right at the inside of that, an inner perimeter of that disk of comets, commentary in stable condition. In other words, it doesn't take much to perturb them from that position, but at the same tIme there isn't much there to perturb them, so they generally are just slowly orbiting the sun. Well, what happens is conjunctions of the outer planets, uranus and neptune primarily the combined gravitational forces exerted on the inner part of the kuyper disk or enough to dislodge comments and send them either either the gravity effect.

Speaker 1:          02:45:46       Think of this, if you've got a gravity effect, polling on something from behind and it's moving this way, it's going to act as a breaking mechanism. If it's a head in drawing on it, it's going to act as an accelerating mechanism, so if you accelerate one of these objects, it moves out further from the sun. If you decelerate it, it moves in closer to the sun. What happens is is that the conjunction of the outer planets can move these comments inside the the become within the sphere of influence of the planets and it just so happens in an astrophysicist have worked out the mathematics of it, that the masses and the spacing of the four great outer planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune are exactly what they need to be to transport comments from the kuyper disk to the inner solar system, and if you change that even a little bit, you would lose this.

Speaker 1:          02:46:39       They've referred to it as the the bucket mechanism or the like a bucket handoff. Each planet. We'll hand off the comet to the next one, and then when it gets to jupiter, the big one, like you said earlier, jupiter is either going to accelerate it and throw it back out or it's going to decelerate it and send it in towards the sun. Work becomes an earth crosser where it begins to desegregate and into process, fertilize the earth with its constituents, which we now know are all kinds of interesting and exotic materials, so if it turns out, and it almost certainly will in terms of the panspermia idea that that life was originated on earth by comments that you had to have an environment that was conducive. You had to have this matrix of environmental conditions that if were altered slightly, would not allow the proliferation of higher life.

Speaker 1:          02:47:33       You now have the introduction of cometary material into that. Well, if the architecture of the outer solar system was not exactly lined up into geometry that it is, then you would never have that delivery of the organics and the volatiles from the comet. It's Backed. It's likely that the oceans, that the hydrosphere originated from space without the oceans, where would life on earth be? You see now here's where it gets interesting. The architecture of the solar system is what's condensed and embodied within the sacred architecture of old, so they've taken that those proportion, however that got there, whether they knew it directly or on some subconscious level and incorporated that into the designs and the proportions of the ancient sacred structures. It's there. Basically the model of the holy city, the new jerusalem is described in the book of revelations is basically a model of the solar system architecture, so it abides by bodes law.

Speaker 1:          02:48:33       Is that what it is? Yes. I think it's bid day. I think that's how you say it, but god, he would just be, oh, d, e, b o d o. It's bowed day and I've only seen it written and the lobbying that the size and mass of a planet allows you to extrapolate and find out how big and far away the next planet would be, and so yeah, it shows up that one of the intervals within that sequences, for example, where the asteroid belt is [inaudible], there's no planet there there, but there's an asteroid, right, and that's of coincides with the ancient sumerian myth of the creation of earth being an impact that there was an also earth and earth to. They know that earth was at one point in time different and it was impacted and that's also what created the moon, right? Yeah. Well that's, that's the theory about the moon, but the moon, the moon is really something we could talk about for the next hour and we can save that for a future broadcast, but the moon is really one of the grand symbols of the great mysteries with a capital lamp.

Speaker 1:          02:49:41       No question. And it's right there every night. I mean, right now, I think we're one day away from the full moon right now as we're sitting here, and I would highly recommend that anybody listening to this go out and begin contemplating the moon unless you're afraid of werewolf's unless you're afraid of where, unless you're afraid of becoming transformed into a werewolf. Um, yeah. So the, the. How is jerusalem designed representation as a representation of the solar system? Uh, well, the, the, the hypothetical jerusalem, the new jerusalem, well describes this layout. It gets complex. And again, when I show this to people, I usually rely on a lot of graphs and images and reproductions, geometric diagrams and so on. But basically it's describing tHe city lies four square, the length, the height and the breadth of it or equal 12,000 furlongs. And there's a walgreens and high 144 cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel.

Speaker 1:          02:50:43       And then it goes on to describe other things, but it's when you begin to begin to do the analysis of these numbers, you discover it. It opens up this whole world of, of numerical symbolism. the 12,000 furlongs you know, how, how much, uh, furlong is no a long. It's one eighth of a mile. It still exists. It's in very ancient unit of measurement. Still exists. It's used in horse racing. That's the one place that I know of. It's still exists. One eighth of a mile at 660 feet right now. If you were to take the earth, the earth, you know, it's an oblique spheroid. It spins on its axis, so it bulges towards the equator, shrinks towards the polar axis. So the difference is about 7,900 miles at the polar axis, about 7,926 miles at the equatorial access. But if you were to take a perfect sphere with the same area, surface area is the earth actually has that sphere would be 7,920 miles in diameter. Now that number 797920th. A very interesting number because for one thing, if we look at a furlong furlong is 660 feet. So I'm putting 660. Why don't you take that calculated? Okay? Okay. Now that's a furlong 660 feet. Convert that to inches by going times 12 times times 12,

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       one slash two. Okay, and equals equals seven. Nine, two zero. There it is. Diameter of the earth and miles that I just said, right, right. The, the, the perfect sphere that would have the same surface area and the same volume is the earth is 7,920 miles. That's and that's actually the the diameter of the earth. If you took a line from the tropic of cancer, 23 and a half degrees north through the earth to the tropic of capricorn, you would discover that that diameter is about 7,920 miles. That's the number which I'm theorizing and, and I'm thinking with a lot of evidence to back up that ancient peoples use to symbolize the earth. Seven thousand 920. But what you've just seen here is that this ancient unit of measurement called the furlong, which is 660 feet is to the inch exactly as the earth is to the mile.

Speaker 3:          02:53:02       Now, what was the origin of the mile? WHere did this myra, we see we brought it up earlier, length of the mile. Five thousand 280 feet, right? What's the. Or think about the latin word mill. What does that mean? A thousand, right? Like a million is a thousand. Thousands of a millimeter is 1000th of a meter, right? Because they're prefixing mil. The middle, the latin prefix, that means a thousand, right? So that's where the actual word mild comes from. So a mile is a thousand what? So thousand paces. Human paces. So if you were to go out and walk off a thousand paces, say counting every time your right foot hit the ground, you did add a thousand times, you're going to have a mile more or less depending on your size. You know, I'm six foot one, so I'm going to have a slightly longer pace than somebody who's five foot five.

Speaker 3:          02:54:00       Right? But that's where the origin of the mild comes from, from 5,000 from a thousand paces. And given that the, that, that standardized, but it's very ancient. Safe. Now, the outer circle of stonehenge, the sarsens stone circle, if you were to encompass it in a circle that just tangent to the outer faces of the stone, the radius of that circle is, has been, has been measured, and it's almost exactly 52 point eight feet right, or 100 of a mile. Now, if you take the diameter of stonehenge, it's a double it, which is 105 point six feet, right? 50 times 100 point 105 point six. There's your mile. It suggests that the mile was being used by those who built stonehenge 5,000 years ago, but you see this number five, point two eight is a universal relationship. It it. For one thing, it says

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       the average human pace related to the foot, which again, remember protocols said man is the measure of all things, right? Where comes the inch? It's this. Here's the x right here. The origin of the inch. The distance between your thumb. Yeah, or it's already width of your thumb. It's this. Well, yeah, so you can. You can measure here and that's going to be an inch or you can take this and that's an inch as well. So. Okay, so it's the tip of your thumb to the first joint. Yes. As essentially an. And it depends because obviously you're trying to size, right? Right. But the idea here is that the units of ancient measurement derive from one of two sources from the human yard stick or the earth itself. Okay, so now if you take the average human pace divided by the average human foot, it's five point two eight, multiply that by a thousand and you have the mile of 5,000, 280 feet.

Speaker 1:          02:56:03       Right? I'm suggesting that that unit of measurement was actually incorporated into the design of stonehenge. Right now, what we have just seen is that the description of the new jerusalem in the book of revelations describes it as being 12,000 furlongs, which again is an ancient british unitive measurement, but probably used way beyond britain. And when we look at the ratio of the furlong, if we took out in the parking lot here and laid out a furlong 660 feet, and then marked off one inch on it, that furlong to that inch would be exactly the same as the diameter of the earth to the mile. Now in in the book of revelations, what it says is that the new jerusalem is 12,000 of these furlongs. So if you take 660, which I put in there times 12,000, look at the number that comes up again, there's a number again, seven, nine, two zero, zero, zero.

Speaker 1:          02:57:07       But it's been raised by orders of magnitude. Now divide that by the number of feet in a mile. Put the divide button here, divide by 5,280 divided by 5,280. And there is what they're describing a body that's 1500 miles in diameter, right? So what is that? What is 1500 miles in diameter? That's the mystery. Now, if you take that number, and I'm going to go to the earth itself, 79 slash 20 and divided by the new jerusalem, divide by 1500. There's the ratio. We get the human pace to the human foot. Whoa. Coincidence, or are we beginning to see that there's an underlying pattern now? Five to eight, five to eight, so

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       the ratio is there, right? I'm not making any of this up, so you either dismiss it as coincidence or you go, okay, there's an underlying pattern here and it's got some meaning to it. Now I think it's going to be beyond our Ability today to really get into that, but this is the kind of thing. Would you be to peel back these layers? You begin to discover that there are, these ratio is built into this.

Speaker 4:          02:58:24       So it's some in a sense

Speaker 3:          02:58:27       it's fractal, yes. Wow. And, and the idea here, just like protocol has said that, that we humans were the measure of, of all things. And in all of these cosmic dimensions are miniaturized and encoded in our very anatomy,

Speaker 4:          02:58:44       randall carlson, we have run out of time, but you have blown minds on multiple front. Once again, man, we gotta do another one. When's the next time you tell me a good? Well, give me a few months to recover from this one. Okay. You tell me. I'm going to bed for a week now. Yeah, I'm sure it was quite a burst of information, but thank you sir. I really, really appreciate it. It's always a pleasure having you here. What? You're one of my favorite podcast guests. Without a doubt. I enjoyed so much and I'm going to go over this podcast with a fine tooth comb and try to figure it out. I want to say one more quick thing. A lot of this information that I've been talking about here is on our dvd that you can get online, a cosmic patterns and cycles of catastrophe. Where are you getting all of the images and a lot of the background and the stuff that we went into.

Speaker 4:          02:59:34       So if you go to the sacred geometry international website, you'll be able to find a link and find out all about it. What is the exact website sacred geometry geometry international dotcom, I guess. So if you just put sacred geometry international into search engine, it'll be the first thing that comes up in your google and your twitter handle is sacred geometry int correct, right? Yeah. Is it right? Hold on a second, I'll check it out real quick. Sacred? Yeah. Sacred geo int. Okay. So sacred geo at sacred g o I n t. Thank you. My friend is a massive honor and a privilege and a pleasure and I appreciate this so much. Thank you. I appreciate you having me. Joe. Listen man. Changed the world. You're the world. Believe me. Your freaking the fuck out while you're helping me. Joe randall, randall carlson, lazy gentlemen. He will be back in a few months. We'll let him recover. We'll send them some vitamin c, send them some supplies. We'll get them back out here. Thank you brother. I really appreciate it. Wow.

Speaker 2:          03:00:37       Hmm.

Speaker 6:          03:00:53       Oh yeah. Well if you don't drink much coffee, that stuff will.
