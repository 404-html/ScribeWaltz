If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and then enter in the code name Rogan, you will get 15% off the number one sex toy for men. It is an excellent alternative to masturbation. Without it, I recommend it. Brian do recommend it. I like it a lot. It's awesome right now. It comes in different shapes. You can get buttholes mouths, you can get whatever are, whatever you're down for it. Even like vampire mountains. Let's go get some alien mouths are alien Vaginas, right? I need an Easter bunny flashlight. You know it needs to look like a bunny's vagina. Cross the line and fellow. Imagine with like art, like real rabid hair on it. Ooh, oh yeah. And the or the fake rabbit. We hear like when you see this rabbit foots, that truck stops that are so creepy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       It looks like there's like a hard bubble gum in the middle of it. But it was a cop in San Francisco and he found a, uh, he, this guy had a sheet, a Chinese guy had the sheet over his lap and my buddy goes to, something's going on with that fucking sheet. And that guy's parked in a weird place and that's weird. And he found that the guy was fucking ate chicken. Oh my God. Chicken. Oh fuck chickens. Let's start with your mom. Oh, what went wrong in your childhood here to fucking in the egg. Did you fuck it's Po? Yeah, he's fucking poultry. I guess you that's where you fuck a chicken. Right? And his egg whole. I guess so. I never thought of that in the egg hall. She gross. I never even thought of that. I didn't even know where, where he would fuck a chicken.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       There's like strong side of it. That's exactly right. When it is like websites dedicated to do to fuck chicken, she can hold out to be enough people. That's about chickens sort of movement. Have you seen Nica Nica Schwartzman's that had bid on that? He goes man, before the Internet, if you've got a fetish it must've sucked. Cause you had to feel people out. He'd be like dinner and you'd go, Hey, I'm going to go to the bathroom, but a or I could just piss on your face. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. That's so true. It's so funny. Mad. I'm like, you know the story about the documentary zoo there was based on those guys go want to have sex with animals. There was two files. He didn't know this weight. How to, how to buy a zoo or I don't know. No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       It was just called zoo and it was about zoophilia if that's the correct way of pronouncing it. It's people who are attracted to animals and they would go and they will be in Washington state. It was legal, real hot shit up until this movie, until this documentary came out, this guy died. He got fucked to death by a horse. Oh my. Then they pretty bright. Yeah. I've, I've told you about this. I know. I got a guy, the guy had got brought him to the hospital. He had bled out. And then the, the, the people that brought him in all got arrested and they said, what the fuck's going on? And somebody cracked and then he took them back to the barn. You can't crack in that situation. You've got to, he'd go, Oh man, he'd been, he was who he was trying to jump over this fence post out man for act lines.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       You can't tell the truth. You can't say that you go to jail for fucking a horse. That's a, that's weird. You bring a dude to the hospital and his asshole's bleeding and there's some kind of sperm all over the place. They didn't clean his ass. I'm sure you know, once that thing blasted and chicken whole, the whole thing is just so crazy that there was hundreds of hours of footage of this stuff and they found each other on the Internet. You know what they find with a, um, a lot of people like that, they have an inability to feel as deeply as a lot of other people. So they do these day that they have to go extreme. That's what happened. It's a term for it, like a, like a, like a banality. Like they have a, um, sort of, there's a pathology where you, you essentially are numb to most of what goes on.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       So they found the serial killer in England. He was a doctor and he had, when they found out he was doing all kinds of terrible things. In fact, I think he was the guy, they did a, they based silence of the lambs on the guy, eight people. And they found it. He had fucking like 25 pins in his testicles and a punch. I had pins in his anus, he was sticking them all the way upstairs and they were like, you know, when the psychiatrist, um, found that it was because he couldn't feel anything and he had to do that just to feel something. Like he always walked around numb. And so the only way to get kind of a rush was to stick. Hey, hey, he's a doctor, ladies and gentlemen. Hey Doc, I got a pain in my, uh, in my balls. He was a doctor in England.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       She's Christ. You don't need a doctor to get alpha brain, which we'll do commercials. This is the beauty of the organic commercial. Anyway, go to [inaudible] dot net click on the link for the flashlight and when the code name Rogan 15% off bitch. Cause I'm also, we're brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n it makers of Alpha brain, the, did I ever give you reaction? Yes. And did you enjoy that shit? I don't really, didn't really feel a big difference. But then again, I don't know why, you know, I only took two pills. Does just once. You didn't try it for a while. Yeah, just once he didn't feel anything. I mean, you know, it's hard to tell. Hard to tell. I had a lucid dream Joe, that somebody broke into my car and I want to know if I take shrink tech, what helped my dreams because I, my car got broken into and somebody took off with my car and I ran outside.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       I'm like, AH, fuck this. I'm not going to chase you. Think caused that dream. But then I was lazy. My dream. I didn't want to chase like a dream car around. I like, I was like, no, I'm not motivated enough to chase a dream. I want to come see you when it comes to the 50, if you examine the statement, the efficiency of your brain so your brain would work more efficiently and then otherwise I would, I would imagine that if I were to put you in a life and death situation or if I were to put you in a situation where that really counted, your brain would work better or at least on, on more efficiently or at least more alertly then then would your brain, if we were just sitting around and shit, right. So you should play chess in Iraq.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       That's exactly right. Well, when you're playing, you know how they, those guys playing cards and when, and they let a bull loose. You ever seen that? And the guy who, the guy she gets up from the table, but last rice is the winter, winter. Jesus Christ. That makes my dick hurt. Just thinking of that, that is the craziest shit in the world. Um, but you know, the, the reality of consciousness is that we have ebbs and Lowe's and we have moments where we can't remember things and we have, where the fuck did I put my key moments. You have your days where you're, you know, your, whatever your connection, whatever the full symbiotic connection of things that's going on to make your month. That has to do with hormones too, right? When you have an insulin overload, apparently that sugar, because sugar can cause too much sugar, can cause that sort of what they'd call clouding of the brain. I never used to believe that sugar is bad for you until him. As I got older, I started looking like more, I love sugar. I love like delicious chocolate cake and ship it once in a while. But if you live in fucking good for you at all, it's like drinking. It's like getting hammered. There's a guy named Robert Lustig

Speaker 3:          00:07:03       and another guy named Scott caught both doctors and another science writer named uh, Gary Taub, who a couple of great books. One is a good calories, bad calories. And another book that was follow up to that book, which is shorter book called I think what makes us fat or why we get fat. And through 20 years of research, you know, and more. And by the way, Barry Sears, who was us, uh, I think, uh, doctor over an m a scientist over at MIT who was one of the pioneers and time release drugs. And he also wrote the zone. Well, well if you look at all their research and these guys are on a clinical level and they're looking at, they're looking at what happens to your body that try to measure things like inflammation in the body, which is a very difficult to do, but they're doing all these things.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       What they, what they found is that insulin, which is this mother hormone is directly related to a lot of health issues. And, and so when you look at athletes that you look at people trying to be healthy, they, the idea is to eat foods that keep your insulin somewhat neutral, um, because that, that otherwise when you eat foods that oxidize as sugar, glucose in your system, uh, right away you run into a host of, you can measure that there are a host of health problems. And so a guy like Robert Lustig just came out with this, this long hour and a half speech that he gave somewhere. And Gary Taubes kind of conferred in the New York Times saying, he said, I think sugar is a toxin. I don't think it's bad for you. I think it's, it's a toxin, which is kind of a radical thing where you go, well, come on man.

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       You know, so he said, yeah, so there's so do you give to your child is doing your child harm. It's not just, doesn't just rot the kid's teeth, it's doing the child harm. And here are the, here are the host of reasons for it. And if you actually look at the literature and then more importantly, if you look at what athletes are doing and especially Olympic athletes or, or they are, they stay away from sugar for the most part, it's a smart move. Should stay away from sugar, does make your body feel different. There are natural that your body can use

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       and sometimes you buy needs to glycogen, you know? But um, anyway, on a.com and it kind of where I got my degree. Hey everybody else talking about sugar. By the way, listen to Brian Calendar. I know it's not good for you. Um, um, we, we have a Alpha brain, which is the cognitive enhancing supplement. And then there's also, um, shroom tech and shroom tech comes in two forms. It comes in shroom tech sport, which I don't recommend unless you like a real serious workout fiend. Would that have helped me in my dream though that car and been able to catch that burglar be, you would have had some extra endurance in your training if you were on shoom tract. Imagine if there was some shit they take that could specifically charge your dreams in a certain direction. Brain. You know what, one of the things in Alpha brain did, they believe a is making people have such vivid dreams is B six apparently vitamin B six gives you some pretty fucking vivid dreams and that's an Alpha brain as well.

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       It should call Alpha Tech. Make that few having vivid dreams. Doesn't that mean you're getting rem sleep, which is the sleep you need? Not necessarily. I mean, yeah, you'd need rem sleep, but there's, I believe there's a deeper cycle than rem sleep. I don't believe Ram is like the deepest cycles of sleep, but when your dream isn't that, isn't that when you're having, but that's an rem sleep as far as they can, you know? I mean, who knows? You might dream in the deepest states as well and they just can't figure it out. Who knows how to, I don't really understand how they can figure out exactly what the fuck is going on in your head. I guess it's electrical signals or something. Yeah, they're getting better and better at that, but I don't know. It's crazy shit. When you really stop and think about it, you shut off for eight hours at night and you just sort of accept it. The juice you just disappeared. And some people, some people, not many, but some people can recharge in four hours versus eight hours, which is really weird. And, and, and they think maybe that has, that's correlated to testosterone to people with higher testosterone sometimes need less sleep. The sleep above an hour a night. That I was always saying that Arnold was always saying that really will lose sleep a few hours a night. Why would you go just that's the best thing all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       Just tell us about that time to give someone Dick. Anyway, as we say with all of our products at [inaudible] dot com what else? Or I'd leave out, oh no mood, which is the five HTP supplement, five HTP and l Tryptofan is a bunch of other stuff, things in as well and it gives you a nice little, a nice little serotonin boost and the shroom tech immune is, this is the new one as far as I understand that the way it works is that this a, it's a different mushroom and this mushroom gives your body the impression that it's under attack by like a bug, you know, like put or cold or something like that. So [inaudible] system fires up for an attack that never comes. That's is boosts your immune out. Yeah, it's called shroom tech immune. Anyway, and as I say with all of these things, the ingredients are available on [inaudible] dot com go to o, n n I t.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       And if you think it's because it costs too much money, if you have any sort of a argument about pricing, go buy it in the cheapest form steel, the ingredient list and make it yourself. You can do it and you probably will save money and good luck to you. I would be the, the most important thing is I don't want anybody buying anything that doesn't want to buy anything. If you don't want to, that's totally cool. If you buy it and you don't like it, you get 100% money back. So it's, it couldn't be any possibly fair. Like you don't even have to return the product if you don't like it. If you try any of this stuff and it doesn't work, just say it doesn't work. I want my money back. Boom. It's that simple. I could a bottle and I can't make it any easier. It's trying to make it as, as neutral and as honest as possible. I enjoy all the supplements I use them, they're awesome. And uh, go to Joe rogan.net. Click on the link for Alpha brain entering the code name Rogan, and you will get 10% off or not if don't even buy it. And your own podcasts pod. Ken, here's my podcast. Ready to start right now.

Just play with this drunk driving and my, my, my blood, well Brody would do it but on stage Brody's a really good drummer. Yes. Part of his act Brody would get up on stage and have chairs to put chairs up there and do like a fucking drum show.

I play the harp, I play the cello, I play the violin and I play the, um, I played the 13 year old Filipino boy and that's when I saw him and he was quiet. Now he's 17. 13 is a, that's not right. It's 17 which is legal in some states. And uh, and I, I mocks automize a 17 year old Filipino boy as he screams, that's part of the music. So we, they all play drums. Like the fuck is this.

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       There's different results. Oh, I see.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       That's me all day. So how many are we talking? Think about how many sharks? Well, at one point they were tagging them and what they found was they would follow them after they would tag them and they were all coming into four and five foot deep water at the Santa Monica Pier. Crazy and all around. There were some of the largest of great wise at any given time. Can Be. How about that now? Now largest concentration of great whites. Trust watching, not tambien the great white invasion. Okay. They don't know why they're coming so close to the shore, but they, Bashar Shark ecologists think that's a good sign.

It was shooting out website thing and there was like an 18 foot or just swimming around just about, you know, I don't know, a quarter mile less than it was probably an eighth of a mile off shore, you know, let's call it 300 yards off shore. That shit happens all day and by the way, they are eating seals all the time. Surfers are always in the water. They know you're in the water and they don't fucking buy you because it's gotta be the perfect storm. Oh Jesus. What the fuck ever. Whatever. It's to be the perfect. Exactly. It's called.

My buddy's bronze in Hawaii last summer and I freaked out a little bit while I was in there.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       I was snorkeling and I was like, what am I doing? I'm going to, I'm going to be one of my own jokes when we get eaten by something. I was down, I was down in West Palm Beach and I was staying at this place called the Onfi, this great, great, really great resort. And I asked, I asked one of the guys, he was parasailing and I go and I go, any sharks out there? And he goes, Oh yeah dude. Oh yeah. Oh No, they're times, certain times of the year they put flags up, purple flags. You can't swim because the bull sharks, they're all migrating this way. And then you've got the spinners and they'll bite your hand and feet. I was like, why are you talking about said, Oh yeah, did they you do there? They're all over the place. They're there. Co He goes, I don't know why people swim in this water.

The fact that there, but there was one summer, they were like eight shark attacks. Yeah, like a fight in your leg off bull sharks will, the bull sharks are so crazy. They'll go way, way in shore. They'll go into fresh water. That's exactly right. 200 miles, 200 miles up the Mississippi near Illinois in freshwater sharks, man. Well, you know the story that inspired jaws that was based on a river, a test in New Jersey that was based on one summer where these bull sharks, where Jack and people in a river, it wasn't a great wife, great wife for Hollywood. You know, when Peter Benchley it turns it into a yeah, post sharp. Pretty sure that's what he was a spicy. It was, I remember it was like this aberration where they were being, you know, they, they will, they'll go, they've found them way far up river man. There was one of those, um, monster quest shows. They had freshwater sharks. One of them was the reality of it. That was a fun fucking show. Even though they never found any monsters. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       never had. They actually even Paranas piranhas don't eat you. I always thought, what if you jumped in? Water is honesty. You, you got to Eaton. If you're living, they swim away from you. They don't eat you. The only time a Pronto we'll actually use when they're starving in little mud pools and you put your hand in there and they haven't eaten. They beat and everything else there and they're starving. They'll bite your hand. Otherwise Sick Ville each other. Actually they, they even put a duck in there with a live talk with a bunch of uh, Paranas Protestant swam away. No, I used to have Pronto's. Yeah. Yeah. Don't listen to that nonsense. I remember that it was called that you had the, you had the gold fish on the other side. They called it death row. It's death row at two tanks. I had a tank filler Paranas and then a tank filled with goldfish.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       Goldfish would just swim looking at their, their, you know, what they were going to be. Yeah. Their future. They would fuck those goldfish up. It was wild to see man fish, I guess really wild to say. They don't just eat fish bro. Delete anything. There's videos of them. I never fed them anything other than goldfish. And that's just what their natural, it was natural for them to eat fish. But I got tired of it. It's too creepy. I mean it's like, it is a part of the food chain and everything and it's life and it's natural and it's just the way it works out in the wild. I mean, animals eat animals and that's just the way it goes. But there's something about just washing this slaughter every couple of days in my house, fucking morose man, a Burmese python and I used to have a feed at rats and really you have to stand the rats.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       You take them by the tail and you throw them against the wall. Oh Dude. It's felt bad after awhile. I was like, I've got to kill this greatness. You know, rats are kind of cool cause you can't just let it in there. There was a rattle fight back. Right. And it's nice to snake its bit. But here's the other thing. Here's the other thing. Snakes are fucking boring. Okay. I like that. It just sit there and they, I guess they slither, they're creepy. I'd rather have a rat and pythons are fucking mean. My mind got to be eight feet long and the thing was like, he would try to fight you every time you stick your hand in there. I was like, keep this fucking thing. Those are creeps. Those are monsters, man. They're monsters. They get used to you touching them. They don't give a fuck about a reptile.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       Yeah. They never give a fuck about you. I don't give a fuck about. Yeah. People are weird man with their connections. Reptiles, you know that. How about that? That guy who had swims where he's got a Costa Rican crocodile 17 feet long and and raised from a baby and swims with it. Seeing that crazy, crazy shit in the world I've ever seen. It's nuts. It's close to, we can crocodile 17 feet and he's a salt water crocodiles it. Those are the big ones. Those are the brackish water. They will be with each of us fucking crying. No, I don't believe you can do that. Costa Rican crocodiles and I've, I've done the research. They are, they are way more timid than most crocodiles and Nile crocodile. You couldn't do it with, there's no fucking way because they will. You are as tasty to a Nile crocodile as any food source.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       They have Costa Rica. So beautiful. Even the CROC crocs are chill. That's hilarious. Exactly what it is. That's not actually a little shy. They're shy crocodiles. Whereas good luck with a fucking Nile. Krakatau good luck raising that thing. It's amazing that there's animals like that that essentially served. I mean they must have survived that big asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs. Yeah, the Yucatan one. Yeah. It must've. Then they had to, if they are dinosaurs, they're old. Isn't that right? I don't think like here, like virtually unchanged for like more than a hundred years when they found that they found this one skeleton of this huge crocodile where the skull itself was six feet long and yeah, I heard about that one. It was basically, if you look at the anatomy of the, of the animal, it was a, it was no different than a real crocodile. It was just a giant one.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       Back then. Animals were huge. Yeah. An ambush. Predator w well, look at this. You all just, I just did a radio show and then sue just was on the show in a, in a fucking Fort Lauderdale. Right. And the guy's been to Africa 35 times documentary filmmaker. And he said, uh, he goes, dude, I was in Rwanda and I watched a giraffe drinking and a croc come out, grab batch raft by the head, pull it into the fucking water, drown it and twist its head off. And then it's friends came in and ate the rest of that fucking giraffe. So nobody's safe. And by the way, you know what I'm saying? Safe baby elephants. When they stick their toe in the water, they grabbed that date, grab that. I mean their, their Trump, they'll grab that trunk and drown it. Okay. They'll eat elephants. Whatever's in the fucking water.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       So Jesus, oh by the way, that I mentioned that the ones in Tanzania weigh in at over 2000 pounds. I got a, there's a video that, it's a one of those iconic ones where w one, a crocodile jumps out of this waterhole and grabs. It was a big animal. I think it was a water buffalo were up, but will the beast probably a be 350 pound a little bit. He's like, when I'm around the fucking midsection and whip this thing around like it was a children's toy. You Go, you get, you get caught, you, you're brought them to the water. That's it. It and it happens in a flash. Here's a piece of the world is going on in the same time as us that's going on right now. I mean, we're just not there. That's right. There's a spot where if you step in the water in the wrong spot, I'll monster that lived to a hundred million years ago. There's going to eat. As I get older, they're all, like I said, is it's different realities of how some people live your fucking worst nightmare and somehow I'm lucky I never lose perspective and that shit. Look at history, look at history. You know the fact that we live in that side of it, I don't have to worry about, I'm Mongol hoard coming over that hill. Everybody I know.

Speaker 6:          00:29:10       Yeah. Blown this. Obama was in office. I'll tell you what, you got to suck. Failed, so pussified way ain't got nobody to have guns no more. They're got to make it hard to have guns. Then they're going to take over. Or

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       by the way, did you hear about this and I'm sorry, go ahead. I was going to ask you if you know how big a blue whales tongue is. It's fucking huge. It's the size of an elephant. God Damn. What about Tom? His heart's the size of a car. His Dick is gigantic. I wonder how big his tickets pictures are enormous.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       It's pictures of the voice and the will live there 95 feet long and they weigh 200 tons, I believe too can wait for the documentary. The guy that fucks Wilcock. Wait, well we guys from it. What were you saying? What were you going to ask me? I don't remember now. I said, well, you're going to tell me. Oh, the Obama thing, the NDA that just passed, they just signed it on New Year's Eve. He sand signed it. That was the bill that makes a, essentially it makes America a battleground officially classifies it as a battleground so the military can come in and stop civil unrest and uh, they can detain people and definitely they don't have to have warrants anymore. That kind of thing won't get through the Senate. You've got through Obama just signed. We got there. It's done. Touchdown. Terrifying. It's terrifying. First of all, the, the use of military is, you know, it's supposed to be strictly for Hipaa did this and we don't, we don't want to ever consider that our, our, our people are the enemy. That's deal

Speaker 3:          00:30:44       don't difference between the FBI and the CIA. FBI deals with domestic issues. The CIA supposed to deal with foreign issues and by the way, you're never allowed to spy on your own citizens. There is a very, very specific reason for that. Very strong separation between a foreign power service, a foreign service and a domestic sir.

Speaker 2:          00:31:04       Yeah. When you get to the point where you're just all automatically opening up to the idea that you can't trust anybody, that everybody must be able to be scanned and stopped and searched and,

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       well, we were talking before the podcast. I have a book that I'm reading now and I've read some of his other books. Leon Uris is considered one of the great writers, Leon Uris. What's the guy's suppose you r I s and Leon Uris wrote, right? Writes historical novels. And if you ever want to learn history, you know, whenever you say to somebody, we should learn the history of Ireland. The problem with that is that how do you, you know, I, a lot of young people, I get like text after I do these things or tweets and they say, Hey, can you give me a reading list or whatever. And the problem with educating yourself today is it's very hard to know what to read. It's also very hard if I say, well, you should educate yourself on history. What does that mean? Do I pick up a book on history?

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       I mean, Jesus, who wants to sit slog through that? No. If you want to learn about history, you want to learn about the history of the Middle East. You want to learn the history of Ireland. Do you want to learn history of the founding of the state of Israel, which I'm reading now, a book called exodus a. If you want to learn about Ireland, read a book called Trinity. If you want to learn about the Arab world, the Middle East, read the Hodge. Uh, Leon Uris is a, is a guy who, who was a foreign correspondent, who, who spent a great deal of time all over the world and happens to be a fucking brilliant writer. He wrote most of his books in the 70s and the 80s I think even the 60s but he's considered a great writer. And, and the point I'm making is that when you, when you talk about how a society and its laws and its government can sneak up on you, if you read exodus about the, about what happened to the Jews in Poland and in, and in Germany, you're talking about a group of people who lived there for 700 years and many of them were very well established in all fields, whether it was science, academia, um, uh, the arts and things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:51       So when all this antisemitic behavior started occurring under Hitler's regime, and it started really in my 33 where stores are being broken in, articles are being read about blaming the Jews for everything. Uh, uh, people were being dragged out in the street and beaten up. If you, if the majority of the Jewish people who were established in those societies were like, look, my, my, I go back generations. I'm a German, I'm as much a Jew as I am a German I, and by the way, I am, I've written several books and I, I, I'm, I, my roots are in this society. If you ever told any of them that well, your government's going to come round up. All of you, all of you. I'm going to give you some numbers in a second and they're going to kill everybody, you know, and worse, they're going to gas torture and starve them all in a systematic way in the concentration camps.

Speaker 3:          00:33:41       That was a troop apocalypse. And if you don't know anything about the Holocaust or, or, or, uh, the World War II, then you're remiss because it's, it's, it's the worst event in recorded history. But it's also very important to us to study because you don't understand and you can't fathom the, the depth of human evil until you see that. Because here's what it was. It wasn't mad men. It was very rational, cold, cool minded men with shaved cheeks who sat in a room dressed in metals and in suits who came up with something called the final solution, which was to kill every single Jew in the world. And they almost did it. And in Poland alone, out of 3.1 million Jews who had been there for 700 years, mostly in ghettos, but who had deep roots and huge contributions to society so that society and Germany at the end of World War II, and this is just five, six years, there were 50,000 left, all of whom were wretches, all of whom were starving, all of whom were coming out of the concentration camps like Birkenau, Auschwitz, a Triblinka and all these things.

Speaker 3:          00:34:45       So when you, if you, if you really think that you're safe or if you really think that anybody giving anybody power over you is a good idea, is a good idea, you're, you're, you're fucking wrong. And you should pick up a history book and what makes this country very, very special and what makes this country and what you have to fight for his government, by the people, for the people. And that's very easy to forget. And even George Washington said, you gotta be careful because people will invent laws to take their own power away from that. That's what George Washington said and it is very human. And if you, if you look at like if you look at anybody in power, I don't care if it's Republican or Democrat, uh, you, you did. This is why I'm a Ron Paul supporter. Because if you look at anybody in power that when you're in power, you, you have an impulse to try to solve a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       You want to solve a and the only way to do that government does what? It passes laws and it grows and it, and attacks. Those are too taxing and passing laws are too coercive measures. That's what they do. It's just, and you do need some laws. You do need some taxation, let's be honest. But when you have a central authority like that, the big question for anyone is who is going to govern the governor, governor, who is watching the governor? That's the central question of political science. Who is going to govern it to and have someone who'd be on? And the answer is who? The people, that's the answer. And it just choking dead out a daily basis. Choking that out slowly. This is the biggest enemy. And you have to be on guard at that all the time. And by the way, it always is under good auspices.

Speaker 3:          00:36:22       It's always any society, oh my God. Even the Nazis, for God's sake, even the Nazis that monstrous machine defined what they were doing along what they would consider moral grounds. Hitler was trying to quote unquote solve up, solve the Jewish problem, et cetera. And, and it's a propaganda that got that, that had lift, uh, Ukrainians and pull, cheering on those firing squads as they were killing Jews. Uh, that's what happens. You can poison an entire mindset. So it's amazing that it's within our grasp. Historically. Look, we can see things, we can have photos and video because things like this have happened. This is, this is their worst than you can imagine. They're there. As you read exodus and I, I studied Nazi Germany was my area of focus in, in, in college. But, but if you read that book and he brings it down in such a personal level, it is the unthinkable and it's the unspeakable.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       And it's like, it's almost like it was the first event of that magnitude or horrific event of that magnitude where, you know, a, her travel had just become like a sort of a big player in the way the world functions because people could fly over you and drop shit on these things changed very quickly. They accelerated very quickly. And it's just amazing that it's all within our capability of recording it and watching it, if that's right. But here's the big difference too. Back then, nobody was watching it. Nobody was seeing what was going on in the, the Russian countryside, you know, stop. Hitler said, I want to get rid of is to hit Stalin. Hitler said, I want to make part of the Russian countryside habitable for Germans. And so what he said is we have to just get rid of all the, all the Bolsheviks that's just kill everybody who's their kid.

Speaker 3:          00:38:07       Just, just empty the villages of people. So what they would do is they would have these soldiers come in and they would dig these huge mass pits and shoot everybody into the pit. Oh Man. That's how bad it was. And so at the end of World War Two, there were 50 million people dead. The wow. How do you get that many people to do that? How much? How does that happen? What is the, that's a very good question. Let me put it this way. And in, in, and I believe these are the numbers, but by the 1943 in Birkenau, Birkenau, which was about a mile away from Auschwitz, so it's, I'm saying Auschwitz in Auschwitz, let's call it Auschwitz. They were probably killing close to 40,000 people a day. And the way they would do it as this, what they found was that when they brought people in and it was at a peak, is this a constant steady stream?

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       Yes. Yes. That's why they were able to kill 6 million Jews. And Look, and let me explain something to you. And it's important if that on those numbers for a second, because there's just the overwhelming, the number of the overwhelmingly for killing. And these are children are children and these are women and these are infants. And they all had names and they all had, they all had families and they all connection. They were all as human as you and I, and it's very, it's very natural for us to kind of say, well, that was a long time ago and they may have looked at life differently. No, they had all the same dreams. They had all the same hopes, they had all the same love. They all had all the same bonds and it's, it's overwhelming and too much for your heart to bear if you really think about what human beings have done to other human beings, especially the Holocaust.

Speaker 3:          00:39:32       It's why the Holocaust that that word, that word, the Holocaust, which I believe means the great fire or a derivation of that. That's why that word is used only for that specific event in history because they did get burned. They did get put in ovens and they did get that. They're all trace of them was washed away because as the Russians and the Americans closed in on those camps, they had to get rid of all the evidence. So they blew up all those gas chambers. They, they burn the bodies, they crush the skulls, and they would use other Jews to do it. They would make you do it. So you'd be 14 unloading bodies out of a fucking think about this. I mean it's, it's as crazy as it gets, right? It says worse than it did, prayed as it as it possibly gets. But the way you get people to go about it, it's two things.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       One is deception, one is, and, and human beings have always done it. And I'm going to, I'll explain why we're in a living in a world where it's harder to do, but, but what you do is just misinformation. Propaganda. You say, hey, guess who's causing all your financial problems? Uh, a group called the Jews or our group called the Chinese or a group called the blacks and there, and by the way, they also kill their own kids and their subhuman. And you take young men who have no education or have been educated specifically and they're full of fire and what they go to war for us to protect what they considered their way of life. See, I don't think people go to war for hatred. I think people go to war because they, they're in love with their way of life and they're trying to protect their families.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       They're trying to protect their way of life. And that's how you create a real soldier and a dedicated patriot. You create a sense of misinformation and young men who are 18 and 19 are not asking questions. They're trying to be a hero. And if it means having to kill all those bad guys over there and even their kids and their, their women, while the kids are, when women are kind of sub human, you always, you always quit a sub human context for the other, for the enemy. And that's, that's what, but the good news, the good news in 2011 is that it's becoming harder and harder to do because of the Internet. And we're all getting closer and closer together. And it's easier to kind of empathize somebody when you see them suffering when we'll videotape doesn't lie. And when you can, when you can hear their voices and you can hear and they create political bodies and groups.

Speaker 3:          00:41:43       And they say, you know, look, we, we believe and we cry just like you do. Right. And, and, and that's, that's what I think has a lot to do with breaking down these natural tribal tendencies of human beings have because human beings are tribal. We are tribal. Even if you belong to one martial arts school, it's so natural for you to go, yeah, we're better though. Those guys over there kind of. Yeah, they're fucking, they do that thug jet too. We do the original pure, you know, you, you'll find that an [inaudible], right. We're tribal and look at teams. But the nationalism involved in my team versus your team, I mean, you know, these big rivalries. So the, but the good news is that I believe that, and I may be naive, but I don't think so that pulling off something as horrific as what happened in the Holocaust would be very difficult.

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       Very difficult today and almost probably impossible because too many of us would go, this is outrageous. I don't think it would get as as bad as the Holocaust, but I think it's happening right now. Well, it happened in Rwanda and the 90s. Right. And uh, and that was, that wasn't the, that was the, yeah. Yeah. And, and those places again are pretty remote and still haven't, but most of Africa, I can't remember the number, but there are an inordinate amount of um, cell phones in Africa. And during the violence in Kenya recently, people started videotaping soldiers raping women and they started tweeting and texting where the concentration of violence was happening. So people were able to avoid that. So what's happening is just like in Mexico, at the drug cartels, people are being empowered by social media. And when they see a house where drug activities going on, they can just tweet it anonymously in the cops, go and find it so they don't have to worry about retribution.

Speaker 3:          00:43:24       So the, a lot of these things, a lot of the social media is a really good thing because it's creating, it's truly democratizing power. It's really spacing power out. And, and in some ways it makes for, um, it makes for a better place to live. Know, could you imagine if you had a move to Africa? Cause you'll have, imagine if something happened, like America doesn't like Brian Calendar anymore. You've got to get out of the country. I've been to Africa twice, you know, I know what if you have to live there, I'm sure there's nice place. There are very nice places of Africa but for the most part, and you'd probably want to be in the United States to live in the Congo. Could you imagine that? That would suck that Japan has had another fucking earthquake by the way. 7.0 like three days ago. And I think right off site Tokyo like in the water, like a 7.0 all the shit makes me wonder when I got to get ready, do I need guns? So I need to start scoring water. What are we going to do as an earthquake in Ohio? And they found out where there's some controversy dead that it might be because they're drilling for wells and that they actually had to shut it down because there was recent, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       activity from this drilling. Like they've noticed that the activity has been higher than normal and so they shut it down. And then like, uh, just a little bit of time later, there was a 4.3 earthquake and Youngstown, Ohio. That's possible. They said that you can do that. They say they can start some, some sort of minor movements with like some hardcore drilling kind of makes sense if you drill a gonna fault, you know it seems like, yeah, but that is that you want to fuck it up for good. Now we're going to be earthquakes all the time in Ohio. Would you imagine if they did, if they just the greedy fucks if they just drilled the hole the wrong spot and now it's like the worst fault line ever and you can't really blame them because no one, there's no real science behind me. It's really difficult for you to do prove whether we know what caused maybe all these earthquakes we're going to happen anyway. And they wrote, we actually have a thousand wells that we've done in Ohio and in Pennsylvania and we've never had a problem before. The drill. 1,000 gigantic holds a thousand that's so weird to like ten one hundred you know you really got that fault line. Good guys. Just think about that a hundred

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       oh fire under those states because we have a water source shorters and parts of this country and but apparently there's a massive aquafyer that that, that they say is going to push a lot of industry in that direction. Like properties. What do you mean by Aquafyer? I mean under a stream of water. There's a massive natural reservoir of water. Really? Shit weird. Is it agriculture?

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       It has all these creepy fucking layers underneath us. You know, we're just living on this crust. We don't like to think that man just right under you. You know, whatever it is on my own. What are from

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       what the Colorado River, I mean this is where the La doesn't have water. There's no water different. We had to divert water from the Colorado River and the Owens valley is just to ride the fuck out. Like, that's what Chinatowns about where the [inaudible] valley had all these farmers and this way of life and they were like the powers that be came in and go, we need to, we need to grow a fucking orange groves. And by the way, let's start the movie industry here because the weather is predictable. Oh, we need water. Ah, fuck the Owens valley rather redirect the river over this way. And they, all these farmers were like, my fucking sheep are dying. I don't have any water. And then, then they went fucking nuts. But they were like, sorry, we have the money. Wow. That's what happened. What a creep move.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       They stole their fucking river. They'd dried out a whole fucking valley. They stole their water. Isn't it amazing you can do that? You could decide power. He could decide, well, I like the people that affects. That's, that's when guys had power, like smoking a cigar going, let's just, uh, let's just divert the river. So what do you mean sir? The Colorado River, one of the biggest rivers in the country. Yeah, let's do that until they created that salt and sea. Right. I guess and then what it is. I don't know. Some did alum, I might be talking out of my ass. I think it's natural lakes in this, we're all, and that result of just, you know, figuring out a way to get water to land so you could grow food. Yeah. Is really a ridiculous place to live. It's a fucking desert. So stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       It is. But as long as the water could get taken away at any time and we're just like, fuck it, it's 73 degrees and breezy you all the time was 93 when, so it's always really nice. Today was 85 degrees. He was 93 minutes driving. Jesus. That's insane. I like it. It's beautiful. I love is in January. I love the heat, man. It's a lot better than fucking freezing your ass hawk. And I'll tell you what, it's a lot better than black ice and dealing with Boston. I looked at high Sierra dude the winter times driving it scared. I remember going to high school up in New England and I would met the nostrils that deep my nostrils, the mucus in my nostrils would freeze. Walking from one firm to breakfast next Thursday. Joe, I've been on the highway before and uh, watched it rain and washed the rain.

Speaker 1:          00:48:24       Just sort of start sticking to your windshield. You're like, what the fuck is going on here? The rain was like just beginning to s to to turn into, I like Christmas. It was just beginning to become icy rain and then the entire road became a skating rink to anyone's just slide into a ditch. I'm going to do it. Everybody would just wait. Have you been caught? You ever been caught in a hailstorm? Oh yeah. It's a New Mexico in the summertime and I got caught in a hailstorm, like huge hailstone. So New Mexico's got home, they got legit hail got hail that they put on Youtube. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. I golf balls and the whole city had it and everybody's cards with or fucked up and everybody does the same thing I did, which is like, Oh, they gave me $1,200 to fix it. I'm just keeping the money and buying some x box games and stuff so everybody's cards had we're fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       Like for years. Their dog's got jacked, peoples got, dogs got fucked up. There's one video that I watched this kid put a a video up of. It's starting and he didn't know how bad it was going to get because it was so crazy. It was like, oh my God, this fucking, this, this tail is so bad. We had to film it. So He's, look, you're filming in his backyard and it's coming down, man. You're watching it, but then as he's filming it, it just turns into the preposterous. It turns into the end of time. It turns into a fucking shotgun of ice. It's coming out of the sky every second to mean his fucking pool is exploding. Exploding with splashes. Yes. Yeah. There's a lot of them. Oh my God, you can't believe it. It's the most horrific. The thought that you could be on your way home from somewhere or walk home.

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       Yeah, but you've got headphones on. I don't even know what's happening. You get hit with the first ice pellets. I ain't, that's what, that's what I was talking about. Okay. That's the, that's the random shit that drives me. I don't want to die randomly. Like for example, how about this? I told you the story where the couple is driving down the fucking highway and they hit a bear 60 miles an hour there it goes, flying into the other lane and kills the people coming in this way. Oh my God. Flying fucking bear. Wow, that's annoying. Can't bear proof your windshield. Okay. It happened in West Hollywood. I saw, dude, what a thing on his car for a deer though. When I lived in Colorado, he had this bad ass fucking battering Ram Fraley grill. He had a pickup truck and he was a hunter. I here kill more people than any other show.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       A lot of people, man, you gotta be really careful. They're crazy. They just, you know, they have nutty instincts that just leap out in front of cars and I don't think they quite understand something can move as fast as a car because in nature they, I think they get a lot more of a warning then that judge cause the cars on one level. So when it's coming at you on a highway, you can't tell it fast because it operates on the same plane. Oh. So cause it's not jumping up and down runs or a Predator runs, they stay on one level. They're not jumping up and down. Whereas it cause hell is jumping up and down. Right. You can, you can, you can measure how fast they're going. But when uh, physics wise, when something is operating along the same plane, it's much harder to judge their speed.

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       That's why when you're on a highway and cars coming at you, you can't tell what's going 90 or 60 staying at the same level. Now is it an efficiency thing for a cat or something like that? More more apparently more just the evolution wise. It's, it's so the animal can't tell how fast it's coming to racing. It doesn't run according. It just runs right. But, but, but the cat looks like it's farther away from you then if it was John. And it's also hard to see. It's also staying, it's also staying low on the foliage. There's a cool video of a guest South America's Jaguars, right? It's a Jaguar eating a giant rat like thing Kappy Berra. Yeah, that's exactly what it is on video. But they're number one. This dude's filmed it [inaudible] 90 pounds. It's enormous. It's like the size of a big fucking dog man.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       And this Jaguar is sitting there just completely frozen, like not moving at all. And the video takes like, it takes four minutes of the Jaguar doing nothing until he launches himself on this thing with Jaguars, which are very big. Cats will eat a human right quick. You, you the one, the one hand, the one cat you don't want to be around is the Jaguar more than anything else, including a tiger. You don't want to fuck around with it. But you know, when people take Iowasca, that's that DMT beverage that they take in South America. One of the big visions that people have is Jaguars. They have lot of Jaguar visions. Did you, you know, my buddy works for, um, like the secret service, you know, and you know, they get calls all the time because like sometimes they'll get there for foreign service guys who go in and nail, they'll fucking take like gr. They try to mix in with the locals and I'll take drugs and then they'll just end up in the middle of the fucking Amazon or the Congo and they have to, they have to get a search team to go find them cause they took some fucking drug. And there are several stories like that. Or how about this, how about this? If the guy during the Haiti, not during this earthquake, but there was another disaster back in the nineties people were trying to emigrate

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       to the states. Right. And I'm the guy, they had one dude, some young dude who is like basically at the embassy who there's a long line of people trying to immigrate to the u s and none of them were getting it, right. So you basically just go with denied. Denied, denied. This is one they had. This one young guy was like a shit assignment there, right? And it's hot. There's a fan on them. And he started, he just like, people kept lining up. He just kept going. He kept going, denied, fucking denied. Finally started going stir crazy. Right? And, and uh, he had this little, um, what's that? Star Wars? Well, who's a star wars character? Both of fit well of that. And bubba fat. Okay. So we have a little Boba Fett all there. And so he started going, he just started going crazy and the guy would come up and he'd go, hold on, sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       I boba Fett says denied. Sorry. And he start doing that. The beaver, that's like Mel Gibson's movie. Okay. Well, so he starts going, Boba Fett says no, right? Cause not all of a sudden the people started giving him Boba Fett offerings. Okay. So like, like a week later, Boba Fett has a fucking pile of everything from food to cigarettes, like a whole mountain like right here. Okay. Then then a block markets are developing over a Boba Fett dolls, Boba Fett costumes. And people started coming up with Boba Fett costumes and dolls and stuff trying to get in because they thought that was kind of who you had to talk to. And I figured the sky was, they figured this guy's obviously talking about the fat and this guy and he's up Boba Fett fanatics. So we should show allegiance to Boba Fett. So people were coming and trusts like Boba Fett and the u s embassy had to be like, all right, we got to fucking stop this, take that fucking doll out outta here right fucking now as this will.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       Cause the guy was like, Hey, yes, I'm more money. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. And Boba Fett says, no, I'm sorry. And the guy who dressed like Boba Fett, like what the fuck? It's amazing that that guy got so far that just shows you that was, that was a story. That was a story that this guy was as foreign foreign service guy told me about. Oh, by the way, my other buddy buddy came to visit me. I can't say his name, but he's a CIA guy or something like that. I don't know what he does, but I know he's been under a rock for 10 years and Afghanistan. He was telling me about that fucking what the waste that goes on. How about this? How about this? In in Iraq, they, they, it's a desert, right? They spent $100,000 importing sand for volleyball courts, so they had to, they brought $100,000 worth of sand in for the volleyball courts as opposed to just getting the sand in Iraq.

Speaker 3:          00:55:46       I'm sure you could find fucking sand somewhere in Iraq. Nah, let's import it from the states because everybody's got their fucking mouths at the government trough and when you got a war going on, there's so much money to be made and everybody does it and it's just a confluence of fucking events in everybody. Everybody who goes there, you'd have a project, you have money and you want to build a big dam or a power, a power, a big power plant, right? It doesn't matter if the fucking Iraqis needed or not. What matters that you burn your money. You get judged by your burn rate, okay. And it has you, you, you, you have a certain allotted a budget and you have to get a fucking huge power plant. Whether it's needed, there are not. The point is to get it done because then you get a promotion or your aunt or your project is a success and that shit was going on and continues to go on in Iraq for the past 10 fucking years.

Speaker 3:          00:56:35       The waste is so outrageous. It's ridiculous. By the way. You know the, the Iraqis you're not, do you know how much oil we've gotten from the Rockies? How much oil revenue? None. It's all gone into her rocky coffers. This whole thing costs us a fucking fortune. And let me go on. Let me go on. Maliki is creating his own secret service. Police forces that direct report directly to him. Does that sound familiar? So we fucking take the country apart and now we're creating. We're leaving behind Saddam light. See you later. Thanks a lot guys. We uh, you know he's consolidating power, keeping the Sunni's out. So as soon as like, fuck you, we're going to lose all our, we're going to lose all the resources. You guys are sitting, all the resources in the south. We're going to bomb the fucking shit out of you guys until you come back to the bargaining table.

Speaker 3:          00:57:20       Hey, civil war in Iraq. It's fucking a tragic past that. But, but you know who was calling all that shit? A lot of people, including this fucking idiot. And I'm an actor and I, and I, I said, how are you going to stop the Sudanese and this she has from getting into a war after all the shit breaks down. And how do you stop the Shia who are a majority from aligning themselves with Iran are number one enemy. Huh? That's weird. Wasn't Iraq kind of a who playing a sort of a countervailing force to a Iran. I'm an actor and I was asking that question. I'm an actor and you know what? I read one newspaper a day, that's all. I don't know anything and these fucking guys couldn't figure that out. So why is it so why do you think that our foreign policies so self destruct?

Speaker 3:          00:57:59       I asked him, I asked him that question and, and obviously there's a lot of people are making a profit, but it almost seems like burning the farm down had a great answer. He had a great answer cause I said, how much of this is like a, a group of men, a cabal of evil men or how much of the centrally planned or people have different interests? And he said, dude, he goes, it's not like that. He said, what it is is there's just a whole bunch of the, and I'll give you another example of what's happening there. I said, what is this? There's a whole bunch of interests working a whole bunch of money to me and everybody has different opinions and some opinions when the day and others don't. Right. And so the State Department has their own agenda. The executive have that has their agenda and everybody has their own agenda.

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       But ultimately enough shit starts to be kind of like talked about where you start creating an enemy. You start saying this might be a good idea for the following reasons and pretty soon there's so much, there's so many sort of, um, there's so many groups of people that have a vested interest in going in. And usually it's an intellectual interests. Usually it's like, I think we can bring democracy to the Middle East. Uh, and that's a very grandiose idea and grandiose plan. Oh, and by the way, because it's going to make the world safer. At the end of the day, they're a lot of idealistic people involved in this. Well, not just money people. And all of a sudden all the shit starts to come together. And, and before you know it, you're fucking on your way to a war, you know? And the way he described it made a lot of sense.

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       It's just, it's like a tidal wave. It's like starts as a snowball. And before, you know, you got a fucking massive tsunami on your hands up. Just momentum. And there's just so many interests in is so much movement in one direction that what are you gonna do then call it off? No, you got weapons of mass destruction. He's used to before. Let's go, let's go, let's go take out the fourth largest army in the world because it's not safe. And, uh, you know, let's, let's, let's make the world a better place. And you get a bunch of people like that who do it. And then of course you get a lot of people, if you haven't seen, it's gone. We can make a lot of fucking money. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon saying, dude, they're going to need a lot of weapons systems. They're not going to need them, but we can sell them to them.

Speaker 3:          00:59:56       It's an amazing thing to the, once that money starts coming in and coming in and just billion dollar look contract after billion dollar contract, I mean the amount of money is defense contractors, Halliburton, the clean up people, all the different people in the amount of monies. Insane. Try asking them to cut it off. How about this? Well, not only that, $11 billion, we have an $11 billion arms deal with Iraq right now, okay? And it's about to go through it. But here's the thing, can't give around the arms because Maliki is not not agreeing to the terms heat we set for him, which was you have to share power with the Sunni's because we don't want a civil war there. And we have a lot of American interests already in Iraq and Iraq, okay? There's a lot of American companies making money. Now here's the thing, you, you tell a politician to veto that 11 million on dollar arms deal.

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       You now, how many people that employees, you know, how many people that, that, that, that you know, how many constituents are fucking, um, uh, our voting based on the fact that they get a job because of leaven. Bill, you're going to take $11 billion out of the American economy. Good luck. Good fucking luck. And that's what happens. Isn't that amazing? It's amazing money, but the money to make shit that kills people unnecessarily. Yeah. Oh, we need $11 billion. We're going to give you 11 million now. It's owned by the way, we're going to get that to you and Maliki. So you can see, you can create your own army of Shia to keep the Sunni's down. And that's called the civil war. Without the military industrial complex, how much less war would there be? I don't know the answer. I don't know. I don't, I don't think it's war that you would stop.

Speaker 3:          01:01:22       But I do think if you take, I think I do think with, with, with, well I think the private sector makes a lot of money off of the decisions made in government. And so there is a profit to be made from war. And if that's the case, it does raise an important question. How if war becomes big business? Uh, let me give you another example. A Iran. Iran has nuclear program. At least we're trying to stop, right? Uh, we did sell bunker buster bombs to Israel about three years ago now. Now what? Our bunker buster bombs, bunker buster bombs and these particular ones we sold to Israel are bombs that can penetrate deep into the earth and take out on arsenal. So if you have an, uh, uh, nuclear, um, uh, facility that is churning out weapons, these bunker bombs supposed to go into the earth and blow that fucking facility to smithereens.

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       Okay. Now we don't want to do it, but maybe Israel will, we'll drop those bombs on aunt cause they know where Iran is making these weapons. I uh, do you think that the Americans are sitting back and using the Israelis as a proxy to see if those fucking bunker buster bombs work? Uh, there seems to be a lot of noise headed Iran way. It seems to me. There seems to be something brewing in Iran. They have taken a very aggressive stance with the, uh, with the, the golf, with, with blocking off, um, oil routes now. And the U s navy is saying this is unacceptable. There's a whole bunch of noise going on and it seems to me things are moving in, in a, in a direction that is not an Iran is favor and let's see what happens next. But a lot of money, a lot of money is real.

Speaker 3:          01:03:03       You know, we probably gave those those weapons Israel without, with, for, for no pay, but we want to see if they work. You know, Wesley Clark, the guy ran for president predicted all this shit. Yeah. Predicted every single stone. He lives it every day. It's amazing. He sees the fucking waste. Yeah. He sees how much money and what kind of a lobbying, uh, power, Raytheon and Boeing and Lockheed are. You don't think they have massive lobbying efforts. Uh, there's just too much money at stake and they can find a way to justify it is legal. Yeah. You know, has been done employment. I'll employ 10,000 people in your state cause I'll take my thing, but we got to build this. We've got to build these very important, um, you know, fucking [inaudible]. These are all, this is all shocking shit. It's all big bummer. End of the world.

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       Shit, how do you fix it? Is there a way, is there a way to fix? I will. I will tell you, I'll tell you what Ron Paul would say. I'll just, I'll tell you what Ron Paul would say. Ron Paul would say, the only way to fix it is to make the government the government that everybody feeds off of. And it has a lot of power to make these decisions that you make the government smaller. You take away some of government's power and that's his NFU. And there's a, there's, I just watched a speech by Ronald Reagan that he made it and I think 1969 and it's called a time to choose. And if he made that speech today, Ron Paul, Ron Paul could make that speech today. And, and it would, it wouldn't be any different at all. He talks about how 37 cents of your dollar is gone to the government before you even wake up in the morning.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       37% of your day is working for the government. And the government keeps getting bigger and getting better. He talks about the war on poverty and if he say he did a little arithmetic, it goes, if we take the money that we spend on poverty and he takes a list of how many poor people that are, he said everybody should be getting $4,600 a, um, a year. But it turns out we're getting $600. How that happened is some money being lost along the way. It was all the stuff that wrong. Let's just go, let's explore that, right? Okay, here's the deal. What if you do make the government smaller? What do you, how do you, how much do you keep? And then what happens to all those people that used to be government employees that have a career in being government employees? Is that this the biggest problem?

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       And by the way, I mean some of those folks are hard working folks and you know, they do a great service to the country and some of those folks are useless and there's a lot of people that are a little leeches unto a sister. Me, yes. And for me it doesn't have to do with being Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal. It has nothing to do that for me. What, what I look at it as, as anything big at whether it's a big corporation or the government, which has no accountability and is that big. I don't understand how you can make that, that power run efficiently. I do see how it can grow and it keeps growing and that's the threat. And like you just said, you just brought up the biggest question. What happens? How do you make government smaller? It has so many vested interests and not only that, it's not just government computerize.

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       Privates private industry is involved in this. You're right, technology computers is the right answer. Instead of having some asshole fucking suit that represents your state, you know, go up in front of everybody and no misstate everyone's position. Instead of having that you could have the people actually let me say it, they'll actually let me say one other thing. You're not alone. You're not alone in your thinking and what the conversation we're having is being had all over the country, both Democrat and Republican circles and that this whole Wall Street occupy Wall Street movement is, is, is in some ways, uh, voicing some of those frustrations. W what w I'll give you a piece of good news in my opinion. Okay. And a piece of good news that we've never experienced before. Um, you hear a lot of people talking about inequality. Income, okay. And there is, however there is, we are, we are experiencing, and I'm stealing this from a Wall Street Journal article, so I'm paraphrasing this, but there is an equality of consumption that we've never experienced before.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       And let me give, let me tell you what I mean by that. Take somebody who's very wealthy, very wealthy. You have a lot more money than I do. I do pretty well, but you got a moment. Your life, your life and my life are very, are very similar. The only difference might be might be that you drive a faster car, but we sit in the same traffic. You drive a Porsche. I drive a Prius, but we basically sit in the same traffic. But the interior of my car, not that much different. I got gps, I got a great stereo, I got everything I need. The the, you wear the same clothing I do. I guess you could wear Armani and Versace. You never would. And the rest of that, it's fluff. We eat the same amount of food. And if you look at most people, and I'm talking about the middle class in this country, including people who are struggling for money and stuff, most people, the average amount of for a wedding spent in this country is somewhere around $26,000 a year.

Speaker 3:          01:07:51       I'm $26,000 that's a lot of money. So what we are doing, what we have now as an economy where very rich people invent something. Say it's an application or a computer or something that we all we all use. Okay. But they don't make any money unless they can generate mass consumption of that product so that most of us own a computer. Most of us own a cell phone, and that cell phone has all kinds of applications. Most of us have a TV that brings to that, that allows us to watch pretty much anything we want. High def TVs cost $700 of the technology that you have in your phone. Let's take the old Wall Street, the first Wall Street with Michael Douglas. He pulls out, he pulls out a Motorola phone that weighs two pounds and cost $3,995 back then. Okay. And it was, it was a brick and weighed two pounds and that was for the illegal is a little more than that actually, but that was for the elite back then.

Speaker 3:          01:08:43       That was what Michael Douglas pulls out a cell phone and we go, Holy Shit. He carries his own phone now a days. The difference between, I'll tell you Steven jobs and I use the same fucking phone, Warren Buffet, and I use the same foam, right? The only difference in Warren Buffett and me, the only difference is he flies privately. But I can fly anywhere I want for under a thousand dollars anywhere in the world. If I, if I, if I get on the Internet fast enough. So we have an equality of consumption in this country, unlike any time in the history of the world. And that's good fucking news. Most people I'm talking about, most people at least have enough to eat. They have an ability to contact each other. They have an ability to entertain themselves almost the way they want. How many people own Xboxes? I believe it was last year, 60 million were sold or something crazy as Xboxes.

Speaker 3:          01:09:30       So think about that. Yeah. So, so, so we have access and we have access to information and inspiration. How many people listen to your podcasts? You don't have a lot of money, but they get inspired that you turn them on to things that they can afford. Uh, you, you, you know, this is what's, this is what the good news is about. Yes, we may have inequality of income, but we have equality of consumption like we'd never seen before and that's fucking, that's a big deal. And nobody talks about that. This definitely isn't the worst time in human history. The great, the thing I think what would really is killing people is the unrealized potential of the human race. That's what drives people nuts. People that really, truly are patriotic people that really, truly do have respect and admiration for the human spirit. They believed that there's a much higher level that our society and our culture can achieve.

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       And I do too. It's not that I'm an unpatriotic, it's just that I think, God damn, we could do a lot fucking better than this. We don't have to be the crux of the world. It's not necessary. We can, we were going to die some day. We are temporary beings the way we're doing this is ridiculous. The fact that we've allowed these people to continue to operate like this is ridiculous. They're not looking out for our needs. We shouldn't be playing police all over the world. We should have a hundred fucking military basis over the world. It's ridiculous. Our military industrial complex as somehow or another co-opted the entire government and they're forcing people into some shifted. The people don't want, even the patriotic people don't. Very few people think it's a good idea that we stick around and Afghanistan, I mean Afghanistan doesn't even need is we overthrew the government.

Speaker 3:          01:11:07       I wreck. We took off and left them in chaos obviously. Right? Everything's fucking falling apart over there and guess what? Afghanistan doesn't have a government, right? They're not even a real country. It's ridiculous. The idea that we can't leave it on. We don't want that to happen over here. My, my buddy, the other guy was a CIA guy said to me, he said, he said when he spent a lot of time in Afghanistan and he said they were talking to a dude on the border of Pakistan and a of Afghanistan was Xerostomia. That lawless area. The guy didn't know what Pakistan was. He never, he was on, he lived on the mountain. He was like, what are you talking about? I don't, that's not my reality. I, and you want, you want a guy in counter hard to have loyalty to add somebody to the government in Kabul.

Speaker 3:          01:11:46       There's never been a tradition of that. Never. So what are you talking about? The just war lords, by the way, I drunk a corrupt government like you think Karzai and his group are, are, are looking out for all the [inaudible] and the touchy acts up in the north. The fuck you [inaudible] brother who was a CIA drug. A drug runner. Yeah. Drug runners slash getting checks from the CS. What? They're having a tough time getting people to not grow poppies. Oopsie for heroin. We'd rather, you know, grow cotton and soybean because it's a lot more profitable. It's, it's, it's, these are, these are a lot of those soldiers. I was out there, I was out there and those fucking soldiers, those soldiers that were building hospitals and schools and those guys are brave. And I fucking him proud where every time I see those guys okay. And a lot of them died and a lot of them got fucking grievously a grievously wounded.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       Is that a word? It doesn't matter. So, so, so the, the, the bottom line is I'm not, I'm not, uh, that's what, that's what kills me is that effort and that fucking dozers, real heroes. You'll fucking men and women up there with it. Yeah. And then we go out there and anybody, you can tell anybody you talked to anybody who really knows about the country, including those soldiers who've been there a long time ago. What the fuck are we doing, man? You can't build us is going to build a nation, Afghanistan. And you're going to build a nation where there never was one. What are you talking about? All you're doing is taking money and moving it to people with bigger guns. What is the deal with al Qaeda in Afghanistan isn't there's like almost none left. No, there's no awkward. No Al Qaeda. And by the way, you think the Afghanis, but there is a Taliban.

Speaker 3:          01:13:15       It tell, you know what Taliban button means. Tell means student. Really? Yes. So you're a student. So tally bond. She has say is you're telling about I tally bond means yes, I'm a stew. Yeah, you're here. You're a student students. Yes. Italian. You know, you're, you're, and you're a student. So you know, then that why? Because the, the, the notion came out of those schools and put shower and in Saudi Arabia, most of, oh, most of those schools, all of those schools in the shower and came out at were financed by Saudi Arabia. Our number one ally in the Middle East. Okay. They were financed by that. Why? The Saudis are what? Hobbies. That is a puritanical sect of Sunni Islam. Okay. Obsessed with purity. Okay, so let's start there. Uh, that's what happened and you have to go all the way back to when that Soviets actually invaded Afghanistan and we were financing the Mujahideen and everything else with the help of the Isi, which is the music truths. You would be, the growth got

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       to ask about this because I watched it in a documentary where they were saying that the, the whole term for jihad was originally a war on your own vices and that it was subverted by the CIA. The root word, if you had an Arabic is struggle, struggle and struggle. You had meant she had meant two things. I look, I said that was very sad. She had very authentic. It's so authentic. I love you. And the idea behind it of course, was the, was the, with the battle that always wages between the flesh and the spirit in your own heart. And then when the CIA was training the Mujahideen and supplying them with arms, they somehow or another subvert it to get them to meet the who did it, who got them to change it to holy war. What happened was when, when you had people who were fighting, first of all, what the Soviets did too.

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       I've gotten some, it's pretty horrific, right? Cut Out, cut down all the trees, bombed all kinds of villages. And you had these, you created fanatics. You created men who, who basically had lost their village, gotten and they're young men and basically looking for natural gas. Is that what they're looking for? We're just looking for a buffer. They were looking for a um, uh, they were, I believe they were looking essentially for a buffer zone between Pakistan and and themselves. Oh, okay. That makes sense. It was all just all due to the Cold War and, and um, and they were afraid they were going to lose control of Afghanistan. Never really had nobody ever wanted to be in Afghanistan. You didn't want to be living in the Khyber Pass. It's too forbidding. There wasn't oil there. They say there's minerals there. Good luck. Nobody fucking wants the minerals that we don't have.

Speaker 1:          01:15:49       We get what we get plenty of minerals from Africa and places that are much easier and nobody wants to go into Afghanistan. It's always been a group of unruly. You still not totally true because of the one, there's a lot of people that he had the resources to top those. Yeah, but nobody wanted to get involved. It's just back then in [inaudible] 79, when they [inaudible] Steve is just fucking too difficult. They didn't understand that nobody ever anticipated the worth of the minerals though the crew for cell phones, you know, like lithium ion for batteries. This is one of the the best, uh, mining areas in the world for all these different, I don't know, it's all over all these different scientific journals. I mean, they found over $1 trillion worth of minerals and Afghanistan. We'll see if anybody is willing to put the money into that. It's such a fucking pain in the ass to it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       I can't understand why you would say that there's, there's $1 trillion laying in the ground. You, you're telling me that it's not going to be big businesses going to pull that out of there $1 trillion oil. Do the trillion dollars can change the fucking world. $1 trillion couldn't put a company into, I'm a senior out of a position of power. You should research it before we talk any further. I don't know. I don't know. It's indisputable. They found a gigantic or of minerals they had always suspected, but it's much, much larger than they thought. I don't believe that we went into Afghanistan. I think we went into counseling because they were harboring al Qaeda. I think that's what it was very hard to get it politically. You can't get the American public that you say the American public, hey we got minerals, we've got everybody wants it to be either or, you know, all we went into there because were corrupt and we're trying to take all their poppies cause it's not billions dollars with a heroin.

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       No, it's easy. It's not an either or. It's a god damn soup of Shit. And by the way, it doesn't hurt that they could make money off the poppy. So it doesn't hurt. There's $1 trillion worth of minerals. It doesn't, we should try to predict the next six out there. There's opportunity. Right. But isn't it funny how everybody wants to have a black or white issue? It's either a crazy conspiracy theory that's, or you know, this is just the unfortunate nature of reality. That's movies. That's what we want. We want, they're so fucking stupid. It's so amazing. It's way sloppier. Real life is waste sloppier. You know when you, when you talk to, I think it was Tony Snow before he died, said they were saying, well what are you guys gonna do about this situation? He said, guys, when we're in the Oval Office and you've got a bunch of people there with all the top brass in the military and the CIA and then you've got, you know the State Department, we do exactly what you think we do.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       Try sitting in a room with 10 we strike, try sitting in a room of 30 people and come up with one, one idea to try to come up with one thing everybody agrees on you don't everybody's banding ideas back and forth. People are disagreeing with each other. People are pissed off cause they you over, you talked over me so nobody can get the presidents here and that's what happens. And then the president has to go into a room with three of his advisors and have to fucking go. We got seven options that we'd been presented. No. Why do you think that in that case, why do you think that Obama is like such a, a wishy washy dude? Why do you think he's the guy that is willing to pass the NDA bill? He's the guy that is, I think my, my feeling and I don't know, but my feeling is in the mistake Obama made and I think the, the opportunity he wasted was not, not, I think he's an academic, first of all.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       And I think he's by nature a very, very, um, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, he's an intellectual and he looks at both sides and I think he's by nature fairly indecisive maybe because he's an intellectual and I think, I think so. I'm just, I'm just speaking, he's compromised. I think it's clearly compromised. He doesn't have the, uh, I don't think, I don't know. There's nothing I, I don't necessarily agree that he's that smart. And also, I don't think that he has a, the backbone. I don't think, I don't think it's an effective leader. I think that, uh, he should be more convicted. He should have stronger convictions. He does have strong convictions towards the people. Got them in power. And that's what you've got to look at it. If you guys look, people spent a lot of money to get that guy into the position that he's in and he's working for them now.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       It's as clear as day. Yeah, well they'll listen. Let's let look at that. I mean a president spends two years doing as policy and then he spends the next few years trying to get reelected. It's just basically trying to keep everybody reasonable. You know? It's like, come on folks, let's just be reasonable with how hard we fuck these people. I mean that's really where the president's job is. They get it and the best they can do is say, I really don't agree with this, but I have to sign it. He voted against what he did with the NDA. He voted against a rock and I, and I always appreciate that you said, I don't believe in going into Iraq. Yeah. But meanwhile here we are who we are. A lot

Speaker 7:          01:20:07       of it's tough for a presence. Yeah. It's tough. I don't know if it's read. Do you think the problems, how much say do you think he really has? How much say do you, I mean, is it possible for him to go against those people? Is it even possible? Can't do a thing without congress. Right. So he has, he has executive power, but they used to be that way, but you don't have to declare war anymore. You just start going over places and next thing you know, shit happens. I mean, was war ever declared and it was there a couple of conflicts that we were involved in were congress did not step in and declare war. Vietnam. Yeah, there you go. I mean that's, it's not, we don't necessarily know there's, there's an emergency executive powers, you know, and then that's another creepy thing. It's like when you find out how many fucking bills and laws are passed just under your nose. Congress passed flying bombs passed 40,000 miles last year.

Speaker 7:          01:20:58       $40,000 Ladies and gentlemen, why is that? Do you really meet them? I believe that is the, uh, that is the number. What I say is that you need Clint Eastwood laws and this sort sorta clinics would laws. If you couldn't imagine cleany Twitter arresting somebody for it, then it should be common sense law. It's fucking Clint Eastwood. It's only assholes. Douchebags meth heads guy who needs a punch. Someone you have to shut but you gas laws. But you get into really complicated issues with, for example, antipiracy laws. How far do you go with that stuff? Right? So, so you know, you and I love, we raging debate on my website about this because we will, because the website, because the web is the last frontier of free speech of free everything and it's not regulated. Now my take on it though, electrical property from being stolen by countries like China.

Speaker 7:          01:21:42       What do you do? Do you pass a bunch of laws? Would that help the problem? I don't think it would. Well we would have, we would have to step up and say somehow or another we're going to, we're going to boycott the, I mean, they wouldn't eat you kill, you couldn't boycott the whole country. That'd be ridiculous. You couldn't knew that. You couldn't make a few people that won't, won't play nice internationally responsible for the whole country. And what the fuck would you do it, man? Well, you know, we've got to do is somehow or another get it into people's minds when they're really, really young, really young, that the world is so much better if you're cool to people and then once they get there, the mean it's spreading that Ma, no, we haven't. Not only in other words, in other words, we haven't never will but what, but here's the thing that's not necessarily true because we've never had access to human beings.

Speaker 7:          01:22:27       The way we have access now and the Internet and I think that human beings to two things happen. One, you develop in a terrible environment and you, you develop all these defense mechanisms at genes that are only activated under extreme stress and you need to develop like a whole culture of people that are in a bad situation on a regular basis and are wired for that shit. That's terrible. Okay. You, you also develop a bunch of people who don't get love on a regular basis. They don't know how to give up. They don't have a real true sense of community if real problems, if you don't educate people and how to be a perception, but once you do and once you can, you can slowly change things. You can change the way children are raised, you can change the way relationships between your neighbors or form and you can slowly spread this out to the point where it can have a real effect. You can essentially be a new operating system for people.

Speaker 3:          01:23:20       Well, for the most part, I got two thoughts on that. One is if you read Tim Ferriss's book, the four hour Workweek, not for our body, but the four hour work week.

Speaker 7:          01:23:26       Listen man, I ain't got no time. I'm trying to get some four hour bike season a hair and he's a really, he's really a great author, isn't he? I really love that. Lot of that fascinating

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       poker and I love that. I love the other one and he said, and he said something and it goes to the internet and stealing and things. Look, he said you, when you give people, when you like what you doing here with the brain thing, you say, if you don't like it, I'm sending back get, we'll give you your money back. When you do something like from a business plan and he talks about it, he says, just tell people you'll give them either you can give people, you can tell people, you'll give them double their money back and people go, well that people will abuse it. I'll, I'll go broke. Guess what? About 2% of the people out there always abuse it always and the rest of them don't. And the bottom line is it's like stealing music. Okay. Once you started getting out there to piracy is stealing. Most people, and I don't steal fucking music. Okay. Some people do, but I was like, I'm an artist. I bout to come up with my one hour special. I'm like, I don't want people stealing it. And it'd be nice if they paid for it. I guess you, if I feel guilty, I feel guilty because I listened to some, somebody a great song and all the effort that went into it. I don't want to see like, and actually most people, most people don't steal music. Most people go to Itunes,

Speaker 7:          01:24:37       they down to the 12 Shawnee five cause they have no money. Sure. But even that man, even then if you look at the statistics, even then if you look at this disease, I my Shitty, I'm a shitty business person because I don't think about business. I try to think about it. I want to think about business as little as possible and if anybody's ever said to me like, Hey, if I could get your your DVD on torrent or should buy, should I buy it? I'm like, you know what man? You should do whatever feels right to you. That's what you should do. Okay. If you don't want to pay for it, don't pay for it. If you feel like it's okay to take it, just go ahead. I mean it's not, look, I'm going to, I'm going to put stuff out there and I'm going to put it out there with the honest intention of trying to entertain people.

Speaker 7:          01:25:18       I'm going to say this is what the fee is and if you pay it, you pay it. And it would, Louis CK did is the perfect thing where he released it himself. Total direct connection between the artist put it out for five bucks, which is awesome. You know, it's a perfect price and you know what? I think that that's the future. I think all these other relationships, amazing books. I'm talking about exodus. I downloaded for $7 and even Louis, they pirated his thing even though he said, you know, he asked people not to steal it. Don't put it up on Torrence, but you're always to have some people did that. But there are always going to him. But you know what man? Some people don't have five bucks. Okay. And I know it sounds stupid, but you can't unless you're starving because of all this, you can't fixate on it. Those, the correct thing to fixate on is get out your point of view. And you know, I look, I've been in a position before where I was broke and uh, unfortunately for

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       me there was no internet at the time. Right. You know, I didn't have the opportunity to just download music, but of course I would. Yeah. When I had no money, I mean what I'd be like, you know, I would love to listen to this led Zepplin over, but it wouldn't be a good person. You know, when I would say I'm going to buy this fucking thing someday when I have some money, but right now I'm going to download the shit out of this. Beautiful. The way artists make money, they're still making money. Yeah. They're not starving. And by the way, it's beautiful that all that shit gets out there. I want everybody to download every fucking led Zeppelin album that's ever made. And if it's, you know, a dollar that you can't afford to get fucking whole lot of love goes, you'll find it somewhere man.

Speaker 2:          01:26:35       But he will. So listen to it on youtube. This like things you can take where you can take a song off youtube, they'll convert it into an MP, three 40 now credit card companies have, I think it's setting a ceiling, but credit card companies always have what they factor in a certain fraud quotient in their business plan. And I think it's almost all, it's really interesting because actually like 2.2 or something, it's almost always the same percentage. 2.2% of the population is going to defraud you and you're going to lose money. And they just factor that in. There's always, it's the same percentage that you were talking about earlier with double your money back guarantee, you know with the, the Alpha brain supplements. Yeah. If he did do that, I bet you're right. I bet it'd be the same 2% of this group of people that are out of a hundred suck.

Speaker 2:          01:27:19       Maybe that's the number. Maybe that is the number. Cause I've always said it's like 50% like it's, I don't, it's like sociopath's. Right. One in a hundred people is a sociopath or something crazy like that. He like that. Yeah, that's, that's a disturbing figure man. One to a hundred people doesn't care if you're fucked up and not one in a hundred people just have no feelings for other people sticking rods in her asshole and well, those are very rare like serial killers and that sex, sex slash by the way, now that I just remember it, I mean you were talking about that guy who got fucked death by the horse. He might have been one of those. He had piercings all over his balls. There you go. There you go. You fucking nailed it. I totally forgot about that. Yeah. The guy had like a member. He had a gang of piercings.

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       If you're doing extreme things like that, you've lost the ability to feel and you've got to think about it. You've got a jacket. For me, the fleshlight is fantastic ladies. Gentlemen, get it on. Joe Rogan. Isn't it crazy with that recent arsonists here in Los Angeles or die? It doesn't happen more often that that, that one out of a hundred just doesn't start fucking, I mean, I guess it does in some ways, but not to that extent. And reality is what Brian was talking about earlier is that Brian Kallan was talking about earlier, is that this is a pretty good time to live. You know, we can fix it on the negative shit. This is a pretty good time to live. And it's 2012, you know, this big change that everyone's going to look back on. You know, like the, the idea that the Mayans were correct and the TimeWave zero novelty theory, you aware of what that is? No. Timewave zero novelty theory was a mathematic algorithm created by Terence Mckenna, the great silence Psychedelic Bard and author and botanist. And He, uh, went on a mushroom trip in the jungle and came up with this idea based on the chain, cause he had studied the teaching and he came up with this idea that the eating was

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       a map of time and then he was going to construct a mathematic algorithm based on the each thing that would literally track progress and human innovation that you could track it like a wave. That it was a mathematical program. Wow. Yeah. That's how high he got. How about that? Sit around and think about the fucking, they have original thoughts that are, so it came and it came to a point of what he called ultimate novelty, which means something, novelty, meaning innovation, novelty being some new thing that had not existed before or some new branch of some new thing. And that a period of a point of ultimate Davonte will be achieved December 21st, 2012 now here's what's fucked up about that. That is the exact same day to the day as the end of the Mayan calendar. So he came up independently on his own with this crazy mathematical algorithm that I don't even know if it's real.

Speaker 7:          01:29:56       It sounds ridiculous, but if you believe the guy, he says that he did not know the end of the Mayan calendar until much later that he had been working on this mathematical program for like 30 years, bringing in mathematicians to work on it. And apparently there's some debate over whether or not he had fudged numbers or I don't. I'm way too dumb when it comes to math to understand any of it. But the idea has always fascinated me of even if it's on a date, 20 December 24 2012 even if it's not a date, but the idea of it, the idea that it's inevitable that like really must have, it's going to happen. And if you look at how fast shit has happened to get to the point we're at today, and just a few hundred 300400500 years ago, the way we were living is just an unrecognizable, the hard surfaces on the road, things flying in the sky and the lights.

Speaker 7:          01:30:42       And now you know his name because he made up this whole bullshit. You know, like he knew the Mayan calendar from the whole time. You know what I mean? They got it. You're saying that that either he knew about it or he didn't know about it? Well, no, they hadn't even know he had axe. Lord. He knew about it. I'm pretty sure he actually had come up with it. I'm pretty sure it's been proven that he had either come up with it before they had deciphered the Mayan calendar or it was that he definitely hadn't studied it and it wasn't mainstream news enough. There was, it was enough though. I would give him the benefit of the doubt and plus the dude was like super honest. It's like if you listen to Terence Mckenna lectures, really fascinating individual, had an interesting, fascinating things to say, but brilliant, brilliant guy.

Speaker 7:          01:31:23       He goes mad, really amazing. Matthew has killed me, but he's on a math theorists. See that's the crazy thing is that he wasn't, he just had this crazy idea that came to him on mushrooms and this is the most ridiculous aspect of it was he asked the mushrooms, why me? Why are you giving this to me? And they said, because out of the, you know, thousands of years that we've been in this field, no one's ever come up to us who had the teaching and their head before. So what it was was to him was he happened to be in a place where he had studied some incredibly ancient Chinese divination system. It's a real mystery with the, each thing is because it's a method of like

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       fortune telling and it seems to be like incredibly effective, like statistically numerically effective. It's really weird. Like people try to figure out what it is about the ching, but it works more than it doesn't work. And what does that even mean? I don't know. I don't understand it, but it's based on hexagrams. It's based on these patterns and Mckenna coming into this field, eating these mushrooms, tripping, it's fucking balls out, had this ridiculous idea that what the each and really was with the Chinese at some point in history way, way a long fucking time ago had figured out a map of time. Well you know like, like the guy when it feels metal, right? When he figured the answer out there was an equation. The Russian dude. Yeah. And so, and they don't even know. So the quote it just the equation, just the question was already theoretical right there.

Speaker 2:          01:32:41       All right. The question is what if it may not be a question? Let's just say it as a question where Matt and mathematicians had been contemplating the answer for the past 200 years. They got comes up the answer and the answer I think was, I think it was like 357 pages long. But the funny thing about that is that at the end of the 350 pages, all the great mathematicians went, fucking guy. He got it. He fucking, ah, I miss that Dan. And he like think about your mindset that you were able to read the answer that but 357 pages long ago. Ah Fuck. And then as a group, the group of great mathematicians that award the metal go mother fucker for one person. That is an incredible achievement. Right. But the answer is it, but also the fact that you can prove mathematically that the answer has right.

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. Right? I mean, whether you want to be real clear that I'm not supporting this Mckenna Theory [inaudible] I am absolutely not, but much money did door am I 12 he's dead bro. Like how much do you think? Oh no, eight off of that. Well, one of the things, you can look at it that way, but I think he made a lot more money off of lectures on psychedelics than he ever did on this time wave zero thing. When you look at the fact that the guy worked on it for over 30 years, it seems to be some weird labor of love and obsession that he had. I don't know if it's correct. I don't know if it makes any sense at all. I don't know if it's total horseshit. I just think it's fascinating that a person would spend so much time making a correlation between the each thing and a 13 cycle, 28 day lunar calendar, that it is a, apparently it's like more accurate than the calendar that we employ today and that you could use the, each ching as a calendar and the, each thing was somehow or another, some map of waves and that the, that novelty and, and positive things, it comes in it.

Speaker 2:          01:34:22       The never, it's never a steady rise to the top you're

Speaker 3:          01:34:27       bringing up is that the fact of the matter is with, with technology, and we talked about this before, we're probably going to live. If you live long enough for the next 30 years, we're probably going to live through things that are going to take our entire paradigm of reality and what we see as reality and certainly the world we live in and, and, and destroy the entire, the boundaries dissolve the boundaries. I mean we'll have to reinvent what, um, I think that questions of being a human being will always remain. I think there are questions that we ask ourselves as human beings. What is fulfillment? Or who am I, what am I doing here? It doesn't questions that, those are questions that you can't, that's a responsibility you can't run away from. It's why I love like Seneca and reading those guys cause you read those fuckers and that these dudes were sat around thinking 25, 3,500 years ago and they came up with questions that we, you still have to answer it.

Speaker 3:          01:35:22       And most of us, most of it, when you read that Shit, you, you go, you go, you use what happens to you as you go, oh I'm living in a fucking, I'm living in a glass house or a box of cards. Like most of my belief system, most of how I live my life, a lot of times, you know, when you read it you go, there's not a lot of scaffolding for that. There's not a lot of, you know, there's not a lot of like I can't really justify it along true moral or truthful terms. And that's what Socrates in Seneca would do. He would just ask you questions like that. It's really interesting. You know, you Kinda, you Kinda, that's why reading the dialogues is such a mind fuck. Cause all it is is just a series of questions and you go, fuck well I believe this and they have some standing and now you're asking me a question I don't really have the answer to.

Speaker 2:          01:36:06       I was listening to this talk about the library of Alexandria and how it was burned down. Not once but twice, once by a followers of the Qur'an. And they, they, you know, they apparently they looked at it. Yeah. The Muslim said that apparently they looked at it and said to anything here that disputes the Qur'an is heredic anything that supports the Qur'an is unnecessary. Burn the whole fucking thing down. It's like a million volumes. And it was essentially the same people that built the God damn fucking pyramids, you know? I mean what kind of information was lost? I mean, how, like when you talk about the each thing, if Macquarie forget about whether or not it's really a map of time and I make but what it, what is it? It is really obviously something incredibly complicated, you know, and that there's this series of hexagrams and the, there's obviously something to it. It's not a random thing. There's something studied about it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:55       How the Irish saved civilization. Have you heard of it? No. By Kaplan is, um, the camera thing. His name is Kevin. He's great, great historian. I've read a couple of his books and uh, the when, during the dark ages, after, when when Alexandra was burned down and, and a lot of during the crusades, the Christian Crusades and also during, during the, um, the, when the Ottoman Empire came in and took over and things, a lot of this knowledge was lost. But the people that actually were the only people that could write back then in Europe were primarily the Irish scribe, the Irish clergy, the priests, and they would write down, they would date, they copied these books. They wrote painstakingly capitalized books and carry them around with them. And carry them in their oral traditions as well. And so a lot of that information like uh, like the Greeks and all the things that we base our political system on was carried through. At least the thesis of this book was, was carried through by these, by these Irish scribes by this hour, by the Irish clergy who during the dark ages kept the tradition of alive in books

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       and kept their own libraries hidden. This is an amazing, when you look back at like really, really ancient academics like you know when when people would go to Egypt, a lot of the Greeks would travel to Egypt to study. You know that there was at one point in time there was obviously some gigantic pool of information. There was a, I'm a, I'm a much more advanced aside and then we give credit to I theirs, that's for sure. That's amazing isn't it? Some asshole burned it all down. They lost everything. But then, but then you don't lose everything. But then as you get older but it's like it's probably more advanced today. Right. And you assume a yes in many ways because we are privy to more information because we are becoming, you know, it's like, um, I, I would liken it to how how martial arts has changed exponentially because everybody is sharing of information with you.

Speaker 2:          01:38:47       You can agree with you 100% until we started talking about the pyramids and then I just go, we'll explain that. How the hell did they do that? That's amazing to at least 2,500 BC, maybe even early. Insane. That, that's a good point too. I mean, it's the most amazing physical accomplishment that human beings have ever done. Forget about. Not In the industrial age. I also think like if you look at Saint Peter's Cathedral, you've ever been there? Have you ever seen that? No. And photos, but it is incredible. It's beyond what you can imagine. And even as young boys to go there, because my uncle lived in Rome and I would go and I'd look and I'd spent all the time there because that would never be that. Would nobody would ever do that today. And the reason nobody, that's not true, man. Did you hear about that guy that got arrested in Italy because they thought that he was building some sort of a military thing and they were gonna, they were gonna storm his house with guns until he let them in.

Speaker 2:          01:39:34       He had a modest home in the countryside and then inside his house was a giant fucking construction that went into the hills and the mountains. It was a beautiful cathedral, incredible artwork. I mean this place was massive and stunning and stunning. And it was him and just a few friends and they somehow or another been working on this for 20, 30 years. Everybody was like, what is this crazy ass hole doing? Digging a hole, dude, you have to look at it because it is art for the sake of art. He didn't want anyone to know about it. He did. And it's beautiful. He has rooms that are like Egyptian rooms where like hieroglyphs sarcophagus. It's online just to look up, um, uh, Italian, uh, Home Mountain, uh, look up or what would you call it? Art Work. What would would you call it? A Cathedral temple. Temple.

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       Italian home temple. Well, what I mean is that the craft of stone making and, and when, when one, when when they take a tap street and two generations of artists would work on it. So you one generation to work on it for his lifetime, then die in the next generation. The next day his apprentice would come and finish it and all those things. When you look at Saint Peter's Cathedral, that was so, that was a group of people that are so divinely inspired. The notion that they were just making what you said art for Art's sake as an Omar, come over here and look at this real quick. Come over and look at this real quick. Put this down. Look up folks. Look up eggs. Eighth

Speaker 7:          01:40:54       wonder of the world on the Wii u k or the mail online. Stunning tempo. See really carved out below ground by paranormal. Eccentric. Look at these fucking photos, man. I mean, you can't even wrap your head around this shit. This is uh, this, this guy made this in, in a countryside. It's insane. I mean, this guy built all this shit in the countryside, man. Look at this. Look at a ceiling. Wow. No, it's incredible. It's you would say that, but he did it today. This is recent. Look at this. I mean this is incredible shit. Look at the floor on this place. Look at the artwork on the pillar. I mean it is some of the most stunning shit and I don't like that stuff. Like I was over these people's house. They were there. Very nice folks, but they have this ridiculous mural like a painted mural on the wall and it's like bad art and it looks so like a boat and shit.

Speaker 7:          01:41:46       Fucking asshole fishermen and you're like, what are you doing? Is there a wall? There's the restaurant by my house and just hired their daughter. I'm sorry. One more. Take a look at this. I want to show, this is the hallway that leads into it. Who did that? They carved that into the mountain. The carved out in the mountain. Yeah. It's an amazing folks that you've got to folks that are just listening to the artwork on the wall is spectacular. The floor, the marble and the floor is just immaculate. It's amazing. And look at this is the outside of the house. Yup. Just a regular house. Just a weird regular house. That's cool. Yep. And they were, they were moving so much dirt out of there that everybody was like, and they did it for a long ass fucking time. That's what makes the world a better place.

Speaker 7:          01:42:23       They occupy 300,000 cubic feet. That's an act of faith. You know that, that's an active thing of this big Ben. The clock is 15,000 cubic feet under this guy's house. He had 300,000 cubic feet. Think of how big this fucking thing is that this guy built inside the countryside underneath his house. That's incredible. It's amazing. 57 year old former insurance broker from northern Italy who inspired by a childhood vision began digging into the rock. It all began the 60s when he was 10. God Damn. Yeah. There's some mother fuckers out, dude. I mean, why isn't this a movie? [inaudible] went blind from painting the Sistine Chapel. Oh yeah. By the way, I credit, uh, I credited Leonardo Davinci without the other day. We were super high. Me and Everlast we're talking. So folks, folks corrected me on Twitter. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. For some reason when I get high, I forget that Leonardo Davinci and uh, bank that they were their contemporaries though.

Speaker 7:          01:43:22       Yes, they were. But I forgot that, you know, I forgot that the Michelangelo was a different guy. Yes. You know, leader out at Vinci and Michelangelo, my stupid head or like one personnel. In fact, if you read the agony and the access saved by Irving stone, but just short kind of skinny with a pug nose and that Da Vinci was a stud, he's a stud beginning and Davinci did. Davinci was the one who was the real a inventor to Michelangelo was a Badass artists. But Davinci was a convent and fucking space planes and shit. That's right. Yeah. What a, what a freak show. That guy

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       fucking chaplain went blind. He couldn't stop when the greatest thing, the greatest fucking, the greatest line for a Michelangelo when he, when he, and to define what you are as a person and art was when he looked at the fucking, uh, at this huge piece of marble and he's about to carve the statue of David and his girlfriend at the time is one love said to him, what, uh, how are you going to do this? And he said, it's already in there. I just have to get all the stuff out of the way. And it was a great metaphor for art or a human being. Like you start a piece of shit and as you can delete enough stuff you, you can, you know, just through hard work and carving and stuff, you can become a better person. It's so important that people do things and that you do things and other people enjoy.

Speaker 2:          01:44:34       Correct. Action is huge. Whatever it is, whether you're a fucking a Datsun repairmen and you're like, oh Frankie and failure is, is more important than success to become a better person. It's, you asked to look at fighters but, but what I'm saying is that like doing something that people enjoy, it really is like the fucking key to happiness in life is like doing something that makes other people happy in some way. It really is the key to happiness in life. And it's one that so few people ever figured out. And that's one of the reasons why people were so fucked up is because so many people have this selfish, it's all about me attitude. And you don't understand that you will never be happy. Not only that, you will be prosperous, either you won't be because you are a part of a gigantic system and you are in a symbiotic relationship with every human being that you come in contact with.

Speaker 2:          01:45:19       So when you fuck them over, you fuck up your whole system. You spread out negative energy, you put out bad ripples and it comes back. It's impossible not to see it with fight. Or sometimes you see fighters start come in with like a lot of guys who are real angry and there and they come from broken homes and they're just fucking sour guys. But they learn and they learn and to get better they have to confront that anger and they have to learn to control it. And a lot of times by the time they're done, they come out of it really well adjusted just men in some ways. The best guys, the best of the best are martial artists. You know, Anderson Silva, he's a martial artist. He's a martial artist. Would you say is in the George Saint Pierre is and martial artists, no doubt about it. He is 100% martial artists.

Speaker 2:          01:46:02       And the way he behaves around people, the way he conducts himself, he conducts himself as an exemplary member of society who can fuck you up. That's what he does is you never get the feeling hanging out with chores that he can kick your ass. You never get the feeling. Of course he can, you know, he can the cycle, you know, psychologically, realistically, you know you can kick your ass but you never feel that around him because he's always so humble and so friendly and so nice. Where we were talking about that though, you know, some people have a lot of trouble managing success and a huge, it's a character issue. It's whether or not you accept bullshit lies or you know, whether or not you look at yourself realistically, it doesn't get better and stay on top. You've got to confront that in your store thing all day, every day and you have to have a completely open mind.

Speaker 2:          01:46:43       That's why a lot of fighters choke or they freeze up and stuff and it's just human. You know, you've got to be able to assess your objective, your, your, your objective strengths and weaknesses at a moment's notice and you've gotta be able to do it completely accurately. You can be burdened down by some ego that has you convinced that you're right and you're doing it together and avoid all the, you also have to be doing it to some extent to to check in in. It's, it's a fine line because you don't want to do things for other people. You're doing it to surprise yourself, but your motivation has to be pure because if your motivation is not, you will pay a price for it. You Do, you do it for art, man. You know, when I don't, this is how I approach everything. I write.

Speaker 2:          01:47:22       Okay. I, you know, I say, well, you know, I really got to get together and fucking do some writing today. I'm don't be lazy bitch. And then I sit down and I started writing and I never say, okay, here I'm going to write things for people. I'm going to, I, I got to, whatever it is, I got to conjure it up. I got to let that bitch trying to, I'm trying to be funny. I just try to write what I think is interesting. Well, that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed, uh, writing blogs before I started writing my book. I started, I was writing a lot of blogs and there's still all up@joerogan.net somewhere you could find them. We need to make that shit easy to find. Um, it's uh, yeah cause the blogs and the videos were all together in the same pile because you have blogs, you have it as a blog or most people don't even know what a tag is.

Speaker 2:          01:48:00       Dude, most people just want something real clean, clean can click on, here's the shit you wrote. Click. Well, I'll get that done eventually. But my point is that I would never write anything on purpose. Trying to be funny. I would just sit down and just look, man, the world is funny. This is just stupid shit that's going on all day, every day. If you can't see some funny in the world. But it's also the, that's some funny, especially when you're writing blogs, it's all always balanced out with the shit that's not funny. That makes the funny stuff even funnier. It's like, it's, it's got to be whatever the fuck is coming out of there. And then I just extract the jokes from that. The stuff that's actually funny, I extract it from that. The ironic point we've always looked at your comedy is to me has always been, um, you know, I've always been, I've always been more absurd, but you, you look at the truth of situation and then you just fucking, you just, you carve it out and shine a light on it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:49       I try to put a lot of observed and there as well because I found out along the way that first of all not being observed can be a trap. You know, people take it seriously. I don't want you to take me seriously, man. I don't, I just, I don't have time for that. Okay. So please don't, you know, but that, that becomes a trap and I've seen some comics fall into it, especially when they develop a following. You know, they have a, this, a, this group of people that want to follow in the way of what we're talking about. Don't fucking listen to your following to passion because you start getting, you start believing the hype. You get older and people like I go on, but yes, but appreciate it. But as a responsibility, it's a resource. It's a responsibility that your friends out there, you know, you just got to respect it. Just don't let it, don't let it find you because then you will start trying to be a certain way. They just think it's all about when it happens to you that you develop a following anyway mean develop, develop a following. When you're 17 years old and you're on a Disney sitcoms and you don't really understand yourself or do you develop yourself when you're, when you're 30 and then you, because back to

Speaker 7:          01:49:48       Mark's example, back in the day when your teacher would taught you martial arts, you've got a karate teacher. He was the master. He would never fight sparring bands or wherever. He's two deadly to spar with those. The Brazilians are like the blue man. Like they, they're your teacher. They fucking rolled with every fucking day. That's the difference between real fighters and guys who are, well no, the real issue is striking versus a Jujitsu. It was, you know, because he can't do that every day with striking. It's just too difficult. I mean, if you, if you have a great group of people where you guarantee, you know, like any man, let's just go light, you know, and you really do not try to kill each other. That's awesome. But that's not normal. Normal is like the gentleman that we were talking about earlier today, the very successful gentleman, and we won't, won't mention his name, who does know how to spar.

Speaker 7:          01:50:31       He just tries to kill guys in the gym. You know, they tell him, listen to man, you're not gonna get any fucking sparring partners. You're too crazy. You know? And that's, that's a god that's he's missing the whole point. That's exactly right. And you know, you missed the whole camaraderie of being a teammate with someone, part of it as he, you, you know, you build each other up, you know, you, you, you, you could hit your teammate, but you don't, that's one of the things that is like an extension of those guys. They'd all those teams, those teams, they're, they're just, they become close, super close because they're bleeding and fucking dying together, you know? Exactly. And they can trust each other when they're sparring. It's really important, man. You know, even though you spar hard, it's nothing mean dudes are getting hit no doubt about, look, you don't get as good at boxing as Nate Diaz does unless you got a guy like Gilbert Melendez and your camp.

Speaker 7:          01:51:12       You know what I'm saying? Like these guys are going at each other all the time and they're doing it the right way and they're both get good as fuck. And same thing with Nick, you know, you know, he's so God damn good. And you know what Nick is doing? He's constantly boxing with Andre Ward. He boxes what Andre Ward is a Olympic gold medalist. Hell of a box. It brilliant, brilliant boxer. I mean that guy never gets hurt. So he boxes and Nick Diaz is professional boxing level. He could, yes. First of all, he's a super athlete. He can put a pace on those dudes and they can't handle. He's for me, he's my favorite fighter. He's a super endurance athlete. And you look at him, he's obviously in great shape. I mean it's not, it's not that. But what you don't understand is his cardio is like double with a normal humans is like literally double.

Speaker 7:          01:51:55       Yeah. And because he has that man that's a weapon, he can use that weapon cause most times aren't willing to work that hard to trial. He does triathlons all the time, man. He'd fucking swam back from Alcatraz twice price and the fucking in the shark infested water. I mean the reason why they put Alcatraz, there they go, we'll put a prison. Who the fuck's gonna swim that they thought it couldn't be done and this crazy assholes. A cage fighter because done it twice just for the fuck of n. That's not even when he does. He's not like an ultra endurance swimmer in the ocean. No, he's a cage fighter. But his mind is so strong because of that, because he has so much fucking endurance. He can just take his name if he goes, let me tell you something. If every round was like a 20 minute round, you could never beat Nick Diaz.

Speaker 7:          01:52:39       You can never beat him because after 15 minutes you'd be huffing and puffing. You'd be waiting for that stool and he'd be like, what? Bitch? And we still pop pop pop in with those 50% punches in the face. Does he talk to Funky? Does you know why? Cause he's smart. Cause that's a psychological war that's going on right there. And if you can get a guy flustered and call him a bitch and get up in his face and get him thinking about your emotions, that's the intelligent thing to do. If you want to teligent fighter, you would add that. I know it's beautiful to be a George Saint Pierre and to, you know, to bow at a martial artist and didn't, it's never be talking shit in the middle of a fight. Do a completely respectfully and he gets it done masterfully. But in my opinion, I like watching the garlic.

Speaker 7:          01:53:16       Nick Diaz get in there and go live bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch. Moving his head. He's half forest moon is Henna moving his move his head back and forth talking mad shit to truly hate the guys he fight doesn't until he fights him and then he's cool with them. You know, he yells after he knocked out frank shamrock, he'd get it. He goes, come on and get up. You're a legend. And he helped him, helped him. I picked him up by his here in Lafayette. Same thing. Neda's brother Nate. After he beat up Serone this weekend, he said, you know, listen man, it's all good. You know, it's just hype and bullshit. And they hugged and it was cool, you know, and Serone gave it up to him, period. He was a better fighter. That's it. No excuses was he kicked my ass and they just let it go.

Speaker 7:          01:53:49       It's beautiful. You know, I liked that. I like when dudes can let it go, but it's a smart thing to get guys upset at you. Smart thing it seems Nate and nick don't give a fuck. I don't give her dare to kick your ass and it's, it's really sad. I don't want to talk to you to kick your ass, but they're punching I then it sees, it's brilliant. They're punching. It looks like he's moving in slow motion. I was watching it the first time I watched and punch. I was like, there's a little bit, he's, it's so emotional. Looks like he's not trying to hurt you. He's like, dad did that. It did. Oh, you know why? Because don't throw your punches at a hundred percent throw your punches at 50% land. 82% of them, they still hurt and he wasn't even throwing them at 80% I mean, I would say, I would say baby, like he went through a lot of punches that were around 50% of his full power.

Speaker 7:          01:54:33       What he could really, if he really wanted to haul off and blast you in the face, he can knock people the fuck out. But him and his brother had figured out this really effective style of like volume, technical topic. That's a real good question. And I would be out of school if I said that, but I don't think so. They have a boxing coach. It was a, a Mexican gentleman that's in the ring with him all the time. I should credit him because I need to find me. It makes me want to go, uh, become uh, like a, I'll never, it's over for me. But you just see those guys. They make it look so easy there. Their submission game, they're fucking punching kids. They're so fun, man. Nick Diaz is just, I love it. Sorry. Sorry. Richard Perez. Richard Perez. I should've known. He's one of those guys that I, his name was at the tip of my tongue, but they'd been with him for a long time.

Speaker 7:          01:55:18       He said every one of their fights and he's there boxing coach and he always, you know, they always credit Richard Perez afterwards and you know what? He's gotten them so slick. Their head movement, their counters. There are angles, man. Dude, two fights. I mean, how much, how many, how many they practice boxing every day. I mean, oh yeah, they're boxing a lot. I mean, they're very boxing centered in why not be, because look, first of all, everyone knows that Jujitsu's nasty. So you don't really to take them down necessarily and wind up in their guard. Nate Diaz fucks guys up from his guard and so does NEC. They both catch guys. So we're going to do, you know, you have to stand up with them and if you want to stand up with them, they're both along. And they both were all these volume punches and I was tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. But that pap pap, and they're so fucking accurate, man. So what had broke the Compu strike record. Nate Diaz. Dad Serone fight happens. I think it was 82%. I believe it was nuts, man. That's nuts. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:56:11       I've never seen anything like it. He boxed him up, man. He was, his boxing was brilliant. And then in the last two fights and attacking Nori Gomi fight in this fight, he just turned this crazy corner. And I think it came out of the loss to what Roy Mcdonald's, that Roy McDonald kid is a fucking beast. You know that, uh, the young man from Canadian Canada, you know who he is, Roy McDonald, he's uh, he's only had a, a few UFC fights. He, he had a real close fight with Carlos condit and he got stopped in the third round, but he was winning the first two rounds and uh, it really quick demolition of Mike Pile. I was like really blown away by that. I expected Mike Pile. It's going to be very difficult for him. I mean he caught them early and you know, you catch anybody really is, no, he's a, he's a full on MMA fighter but, and he's a young kid.

Speaker 7:          01:56:53       He's been training him and may only for his whole life from the beginning to end. Well, Nate had a fight with them and then Nate lost a decision. It didn't get hurt. He never got beat up. He got thrown around a little bit. The guy took him down a few times, like soup plucks them and stuff. But you know, one of the things about the Diaz brothers is there amazing defense. You know, they're, they're always, they're so used to fighting against brutal guys and training that they're really good at surviving, you know, and so he realized that he probably should be at 155 pounds. It was like a better way because he was fighting one 70 and he build up to get there. He didn't go up to like one 85 one 90 and then cut his weight down. He was, you know, he was essentially, you know, weighing in like much, much closer to the 55 pound women, but the last two fights, yet at lightweight, it was tacking or go me and this last one against the, and both of them, it was just tense.

Speaker 7:          01:57:37       Wrong is no joke, man. No, he's a beast. You know, I think what happened was I think, you know, naked pissed off at himself after that, uh, that fight with Rory Mcdonald and he said, you know what? Fuck it. I'm kicking it up a notch and decided, you know, one 55 was where I was supposed to be. And they're just really get to, it gave him the finger like that, that now it's beautiful. It's beautiful, man. It's, this is war man. It's psychological war. You know, like Larry Bird used to show up at every three point contest and go, who's coming in second? That's it. You know, you gotta think about Larry Bird when you're fucking shooting that shot now because you can't be in the zone because no one, no one's fucked with you. And you could have your own positive thoughts. No, you got Larry Bird's freckly little white ass cracker phase going, who's coming inside?

Speaker 7:          01:58:14       You know? And you know what I said to me when I saw him give him the finger, I went, that guy's not tired. He's not tired, he doesn't get tired. He's just like his brother. They go on, you know, they do some fucking extreme endurance work, man. And they keep their conditioning and a really high level. And if you do that, you can put a face on it, dude, they can't fuck with. And then on top of that, if you have really good striking, you know, then it's like, man, you're getting striking. Like that is so difficult. That takes balls. You have to have balls, you have to go in there with guys who can take your fucking

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       face. Yeah. And you get here hit and hurt. You gotta learn defense. You got to learn how to roll with punches. You gotta you gotta learn who not to spar with or some dudes that it's not worth it. Some days you could spar him every now and then like especially if you're feeling fresh or something like that. Do you think they keep a guy out box with just strict boxes like Andre Ward? Do you start to try to fight him just to Zach's or MMA guys? A lot of different though. A lot of guys, especially in the early days of him and may like I've had long conversations with dude about this dude's about this who started out in like the early nineties they didn't know any better and they would just go full blast in the gym all the time. And then somewhere along the line people start telling them like, hey man, you shouldn't do this.

Speaker 2:          01:59:16       Like you guys should be sparring with technique and this is how you do that and this is how you save yourself for the, yeah, because nobody is ever using the jab back then or anything like that. Everybody was like, Hey, maker central and then you get in there. That's one of the reasons why a guy like Anderson shines. You know, you get in there with a guy like Anderson, like Chris Liebing just charged at him. Just went to try to maul him, which was, you know, if you're going to give him a good strategy, which is a good strategy to stay on the outside of, let them pick you apart or chase that motherfucker down. I would, I would have told Chris to do the same thing. He just wasn't ready for that level yet in that technical level that Anderson's achieved, you know, he has all the techniques.

Speaker 2:          01:59:50       He doesn't have just haymakers he's, he came from a technical Moyie Thai background, you know, so his technique is beautiful. I was watching a tagline office down in American top team trained with them, right? Yeah. Train with that. It was best friend I guess. And coach Muay Thai coach who's a stud himself, just like this real good looking dude. He's like, and I got, I was, I was so, it was so exciting cause Tiago was, is a big death valley fan. So he came up to me, it's like this is a show that you're on for people. That is, I do the, I'm a huge fan. You May, you crack me up. It's so funny and terrible accident. Not at all. But he's so funny and we had such a laugh when he took me around and we had a blast but he gave me a private Moy Tai class and then, and then he rolled with me and Jujitsu and if you ever want to feel like a hen, a wolf, that's, that's, it was ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          02:00:36       He's so strong. He kicked the bag at one point just lightly. I was holding it. He was showing me around house like a low kick it, the power is retarded with that guy. You know, the beautiful thing about him is when he throws things, he does it. Everything is like tight and Tucker, he's a, he's got some of the best defense as far as like MMA strikers. He's got some of the best deal I can tell and I spent enough time with him. He's fucking smart guys doing everything. Very technical. He's very smart. He's matured a lot. He's 28 now and he was just very open about what, what a what a crazy fucker he was when he was younger, spending money going crazy and you see his last fight against puppy a baby. No, I tore the guy who was beautiful because this guy's a monster man. This patio Betty looks like the last guy you'd ever want to fight. You look at him, he's just ridiculously shredded. He's a judo black belt who can strike. He's like a of very similar to a shirker. No, no, no. The Beltour Hector Lombard, very similar to that. Bella toward champion. Hector Lombard. Really similar. Just build and ridiculous power

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       punches really fast and Tiago just stayed in the pocket. Managers caught him with a little shot at the little shot leg kicks and the dude was swinging it. Tiago man, the dude was a scary guy, but it was a beautiful display of technique and patients and being a veteran and overcoming, I have be everybody fights in the UFC, man, that's a lot of fights and that pappy a betting guy, I feel like he could beat anybody. I feel like if he just, if you fuck up and let that guy punched you in the face, like if somehow or another you zig when he should have zagged and you get caught, which happens to guys. Well you saw the John Fitch fight this weekend. He got knocked out, knocked out with one punch. Well, you know there's a followup punch, but essentially the one punch was the one that really did it.

Speaker 7:          02:02:16       Yeah. Johnny Hendricks caught him and he tried to come back from it. You know we tried to, well with those, with those little gloves, your margin for error really slims down and that's where, that's where learning technique and if you look at boxers when they teach you you're, you're spending more time avoiding them, throwing punches. Anybody can throw hands but, but moving out of the way and then, and then hitting or just being able to slip punches that tells us there's a lack of like real high level technical boxing. A lot of a lot of areas takes forever. It takes forever and it's really hard to learn everything. You know, it's one of the reasons why a lot of people think you should be awesome at one thing before you ever got into MMA. Cause you know, it's like the Rory Mcdonald's of the world are very rare and this is this young kid who's starting out and he's got great wrestling, is wrestling, is outstanding kickboxing as nasty as Jujitsu, solid as fuck.

Speaker 7:          02:03:04       He's really got no weaknesses. But you know, he's, he's one of those 22 year old kids that can actually do that. This came up with it from the, from the get go, you know, for the most part, most guys they came up with one discipline or another. And the best thing that could hope for was to be really good at something. But they're really good at wrestling. So they'd take God down are really good at striking. You just learn how to sprawl. Like Mirko Cro, cop, you know, he never really became anything other than a striker. He has a couple of submission victories, but they're mostly after he except the random and fight mostly after he was fucking a guy up the, uh, the question is, can anybody beat John Bones Jones and does he go to heavyweight? Sure. Anybody can. You know what? Nobody ever expected the Jon Bones Jones was ever going to exist.

Speaker 7:          02:03:42       You know, before he existed, nobody would have suspected that some brilliant young kid could come in here who was a, an excellent amateur wrestler with, you know, a few years of karate and taekwondo or something under his belt. And maybe not even a few years, I should say, like, you know, months of it. But just, you know, practice some kicks and knew how to do them and then you get him with some ace trainers like Mike Winkeljohn and Greg Jackson and they mold this kid into some fucking prodigy. I would, I would've never said that could have happened before that some kid could have been in the game only like three years and just dominate guys like shogun dominate cause like Machida Yoel he put machine at asleep with a standing guillotine. When's the last time anybody put on high level champion to sleep with a standing gate and then dropped him like it was mortal Kombat.

Speaker 7:          02:04:26       Like he just beheaded him and shit. It was like, Hey g, it's ridiculous. So he's a, he's, you know what he is man. He is the king of the new school. That's what he is. Jon Jones is the king of the new school. There's no one who can fuck with him. You guys, there's a level, there's a high level, there's a higher level than has ever existed before in Jon Jones is at the peak of that junior dos Santos. But there's another way of coming and another way of coming as those Roy McDonald dudes, you know, Jon Jones started out as a wrestler and learned all that striking and slowly become better at striking. Rory Macdonald is great at everything. He's great at everything. It's his fucking head movement is nasty. It's striking, it's clean, it's technique is perfect. He got knockout power. It's fucking 22 years old and he's smart and he's a little savage.

Speaker 7:          02:05:10       Those guys are coming up and there's, there's a 14 year old right now that will probably fuck him up. And that the guy that was hitting pads in Vegas right now ever see those two little kids, the little Mohawk kids do. Those cool kids can do everything. They're like little treats. I don't know how they all now, but they're super dedicated. They love the sport, you know, and they get a lot of attention. So they do it a lot in their parents. Love it. And come on man. That those kind of guys, that's the next wave. So as crazy as hoists, Gracie was in 1993 John Jones is in 2012 and as crazy as Alistair Overeem is in 2012 you're going to have some new dude that's going to be 10 years from now or whatever and he's going to have some mad distance between them because there'll be a, there'll be a sport as itself, cause right now it's a sport that's piecemealed from a bunch of other different sports, right.

Speaker 7:          02:05:58       With no clear formula. That's right. Eventually they're going to get a pretty clear for them. Yet eventually there's going to be, there's going to be, it seems MMA as a, as its own fighting system is going to, it's going to solidify most likely, most likely boxing like, yeah. But part of the fun is the ebb and flow in the battle. Walt's happening all of a sudden, karate is what everybody needs to know. Nobody could touch Machinga oh shit. Who would've ever thought it was karate after all these years if you just have the sprawling than it's karate. And then you know a guy like Jon Jones comes around and I was like, oh no, no, no. It's length. It's distance and intelligence in a wrestling background. That's what's important. And the willingness to believe in yourself and just throw wild shit. And the fact that nobody can hit you because you're a mile away from them, you connect on them.

Speaker 7:          02:06:37       What about, what about him and junior desantis will they fight? Maybe eventually. I think Jon Jones was somewhat someday be a heavyweight cause he's so young. I think he's only 2,400 see what weight does he walk around that? That's a good question. You know, I should ask him. I think he's above two 15 to 20 I think he gets pretty heavy and then he drops the weight, you know, and eats healthy. And I think he's got a big family and I think it's, he's got big, you know, I was young kid, he's going to fill out, I think one professionally. I think you'd be amazing as a heavyweight too. He's big enough. He's just got to skinny legs. Yeah. And those could get bigger. And by the way, he'd be even more ridiculous than could you imagine if all of sudden you had super legs underneath them.

Speaker 7:          02:07:12       We did all fucking squats and dead lifts and just triangle the fuck out of my gym. Imagine that evolves in these triangling people. I mean, he can do anything that's, he's a guy you shouldn't, I believe he's six, four, I believe. Six, four really tall. He's really tall. But his reach is what's ridiculous. Yeah. But we'll pull that up, Brian. Find out how tall John Jones, and by the way, what is Anderson Silva Tall? Is He, I think he's six too. That'd be great to see that fight. Yeah. But you know, the, the issue is a wrestling issue, you know, I mean, he's, um, Anderson Anderson is like, he's an amazing, amazing fighter. But when you're taking on a guy who was physically much bigger than you, right. He's Anderson is, well, we ask him how tall he is. Six foot four. Yeah. He's got a six foot four, but he has a reach that's bigger than some seven foot tall people.

Speaker 7:          02:08:05       He's got a crazy reach. Yeah. I mean, I just said that and that's real. His reach is the longest of anyone in the UFC, including semi shelt who used to fight for the UFC. So his ability to touch you with his hands is like right up there with Stephan struve. Stephan skyscrapers. Struve has a, I believe he has a shorter wingspan than Jon Jones does. So he's just got, he's got everything going for him. He's got intelligence, he's got confidence, he's, he's got the, uh, the courage to get in there and fucking throw down against the best fighters in the world even though he's only been doing it for three years and he's got the athleticism to pull it off and he listens to everything. And then you're like, you listen to like interviews with them to do it is on youtube all the time. Like watching wrestling matches and learning moves and putting them in his head.

Speaker 7:          02:08:46       He's a fucking, he's loving that. He's the baddest mother. Tell me that, that, that Anderson's, I said what's interesting like, and he said he's a martial arts nerd. He loves martial arts. He like watch his stuff. Old Guys. But you don't get as good as Anderson unless you're completely obsessed with it. You know, there's the story of Anderson's fight with Tony Fryklund. Did you know that story? Yeah. Anderson fought Tony fricken and he had this crazy upward elbow that he wanted to try like some shitty song and on Bach moving and uh, his coaches were like, we get the fuck out of here with his elbow. Like he kept practicing this really nutty elbow that like would never come up. It was like a Kung Fu move, you know, it was like, I, it was like some stuff that you saw in a movie that you would never see in an MMA fight where, you know, it's much more dangerous.

Speaker 7:          02:09:26       But, um, he made his wife hold the Pellot forum and he would practice this upward elbow. They made his wife like hold pads and he would practice this shit over and over again. He had to do it away from his coaches. And so then he was like in in the the actual cage and he like told his fucking coach, I'm going to do that upward elbow, the league who shut the fuck up and get out of here with this crazy upward elbow. And Bob Blam, he catches Frickin with this upward elbow and puts them to sleep. Not just put them asleep but stiff armed them who went down like stiff leg, stiff on nothing, was working and he blessed them with an elbow and then Anderson just walks away like he's a Ninja. It was the most ridiculous shit ever. But that's what it is. He like, he learned a technique that was outside of his discipline.

Speaker 7:          02:10:07       He's just such a bad motherfucker. What he's got is just like John Jones, he's very intelligent and his timing is amazing. And his confidence and intelligence, timing, confidence and character. And with Anderson to Anderson is a guy who's been proven. I mean, Jon Jones has never been in a fight where he got dominated for four rounds and then pull it off in the fifth you know, there's, there's something invaluable about what Anderson has accomplished. And the Wood Anderson showed them that shell son and fight was that he's not just the hammer, that, you know, he can, he can take it, dude, you can't break him. And if you slip, yeah, he's looking for, he's looking for a way to win, man. And if you slip, he's going to find it. Guess what? Yeah. It's only unmet need to go, but look at this. What's, this? Could not believe that bitch.

Speaker 7:          02:10:53       Yeah. I mean he just did what he had to do and one came in, they're injured, you know? Oh, is that what it was? Oh yeah, he edited it. He had a rib issue out of it. Well that's why he let him take him down. You know? He's like, you know, I could stand up but this guy, or I could just fucking barley fight off the take downs. Interesting. Yeah. If you can't take them now, but Chelsea and has the best double in the sport. His running, charging double dude, he just takes motherfuckers down. Even if Anderson was like fully healthy, I don't know if he could stop that guy from taking them down. A lot of people don't know she does. The thing about shell son and dude is Chelsea and the one who's right and right now he's right. He's one of the best on the planet.

Speaker 7:          02:11:30       Dude, that wrestling is insane. His top position is boxing is fucking good. When he caught Anderson with that straight left and wobbled him, look, I don't give a fuck what you say. That's got to put some thoughts into a guy's head. You've got to guard charges at you. Throws fucking clean, crisp punches, different can take a shot and his wrestling's ridiculous. And now after the Brian Stann fight, oh, he's strangling people too. And now we started submitting people. Jesus Christ. And you got to tell you, you want to talk about a guy talking shit fucking with your head. [inaudible] he's the best ever. The grain white said he's the best since Muhammad Ali. I, you know, Muhammad Ali was in a different world because he was, he had a different flavor to them. It was like a ridiculousness to which chill sort of has a little bit of a ridiculous to him.

Speaker 7:          02:12:14       But God damn, that dude's funny. He's hilarious and he's so prolific. He's amazing. He's always coming up with new ridiculous shit to say. I wish they didn't hate him so much in Brazil because he said a lot of crazy shit. I know, I know, I know, I know. And you know what he probably mean. Whatever. I shouldn't say you probably shouldn't have done that, but now he can, you know, if he went there, I mean it would probably suck for him everywhere he goes. People be screaming and yelling at him. If he has balls ballsy enough to actually fight you gonna fight. Is he going to finance itself as I can be on the boat? Who knows? He says, no, he said that he's got a, an announcement and he said, uh, my next move after Mark Munoz, what he said was, I don't know, but if I was a George Saint Pierre or John Jones, I'd take a real deep gulp right about now, chill son and said that. So He's, he's insinuating that he will want to fight Jon Jones or George Saint Pierre and since her real gold right now he's, he's a hilarious showmen and since George just had knee surgery and he had patella tendon graft, knee surgery, which is particularly difficult to come back from, not difficult, but time consuming because you have, well you have, yeah. You know, it's, it's a little more, I mean differ. Every doctor has their own philosophy and doctors have their own specialty, but some doctors don't like to do it that way because they believe that it compromises

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       the strength of the patella tendon and it makes a knee a little bit wigglier. I have both. I had this one done. My left knee was done. Patella tendon graft. My right knee was done with a cadaver and the right knee came out way better. Maybe it was a better doctor. That's very possible. But the God that I did in New York was a top notch guy that did like New York Knicks and did basketball teams and shit. He was supposed to be really good, but it took a long time before that knee felt right. Again, this is my right knee would felt great in like a few months, like four or five months. My right knee was fine. My left knee, well Noah did surgery is very different. They take a chunk out of your bone and they slice your tendon. They'd take a strip of that tendon and a chunk out of your Shin Bone.

Speaker 2:          02:14:10       So they pull it off intact and one thing and then they open you up and screw that in place and that becomes your new ACL and he tore his ACL. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He tore it. He tore a training. He heard it and then he had to pull out the Nick Diaz fight or the Carlos condit fight, whichever fight it was at that point in time. I believe it was Carlos Condit. Yeah, it was Carlos Condit. He pulled out of that fight and then I would have loved to have seen that Nick Diaz. Uh, yeah. Well he kept trying to train. I guess that's really what fucks you up. You know, I have a little back injury and this little Mussel Pole, it's where my floating rib head is. It's like we're connects to like where your scapulas. Yeah, it's been a fucking pain in my ass for like a couple of months. And the reason being because it was hurting me and I said, oh, I'll just go and roll light.

Speaker 2:          02:14:55       And that's when you do like when you have an injury you have to, it's like driving your car with a flat tire. Like yeah, just go slow. Like you gotta be Super Smart in combat sports when you have an injury. And George hurt his knee. He had to pull out the fight and then he tried training again too soon. And then he blew it and then it exploded on him. You know, you, you know, it just lost the ACL and that's what happens a lot of times. You have like small, you do damage to the knee, the knee will be compromised and week and then you heard it again. That's exactly what happened to me. In fact, on my first knee surgery and the four hour body, that's why it says that Soviets, the Soviets, coaches as well as guys don't they? The way they get you conditioned for an Olympic condition, they make you walk really fast for 15 minutes and every day you have to cover more ground.

Speaker 2:          02:15:35       So walking is your aerobic exercise and if you walk speed, walk for 15 minutes as fast as you can, you'll get in the best shape of your life, especially if you do it uphill. That's hilarious. That's a great idea. Fucking if you get on a treadmill and put it at four miles an hour at 15 degrees incline at 50 at 58 the highest inclined. Just try that shit sometime. Try Walking for four miles an hour and at for 15 minutes. [inaudible] had a great article on his website about, uh, in intelligence and efficiency over overtraining and how important it is to build up real undertrained. What they found is that Dan Gable and those American masters overtrained, what happens is you get injuries later on that stuff. They have unstoppable mental strength because of it. Of course, their ability to dominate competition, the ability to there, you know, no one has more mental strength in combat, then they're, they're on another level.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       Man Readiness. I went to, Dan gave us camp for two weeks. I remember and not realizing if this is what it takes to train in college. I don't want to fucking be a college wrestler. This is this. I don't want to get up and sprint for an hour in the morning. I was like, this, this, I was 17. I was like, fuck this. I did it. Then I came back my senior year and did pretty fucking well just cause I had been in Iowa. But yeah, it was one of the reasons I quit wrestling over a taekwondo when I was in high school. I was doing wrestling and taekwondo and wrestling made me so fucking tired. I remember have the first day after practice we ran stadium stairs or something like that. The first after practice I couldn't walk. I was like walking in the hallways. I would have to like stop for a second and like massage my upper thighs and then walk again.

Speaker 2:          02:17:11       Matches, matches sometimes masters to go over time and an extra three minutes. You thought you were going to fucking die. I'll never forget that. That that is a young man. When you, when you wrestle like you know I wrestled pretty, you know, it was my sport. You never that, that fear of going walking on that and mat against somebody you don't know when you're 14 1516 1718 yeah. It does change you. It really does force you even any sport and he's just playing basketball. Anything we have to step up when you're alone for cultural sports, when you were alone, it's a lonely place on that mat. It is definitely, I think more troubling or more more a taxing and more testing of your character and to go to Iowa. To this intensive wrestling cabin. It, Dan's gable and you're around, all these all have a Midwestern animals and you're like, holy, you're ready to dedicate every wrestling.

Speaker 2:          02:17:59       Why is that? 17, I'll have a fucking mustache. You know, one of the first times I ever saw Matt Hughes fights, I remember thinking like this back when he used to, they used to let them wear wrestling shoes. Okay, good luck. Good luck. Good luck stopping that shot with his red wrestling shoes. I got so fucking God told me he was the strongest guy he'd ever, Russell. He said Matt Hughes was the strongest person I'd ever, oh, I believe it. You know, Matt Hughes tapped out fucking Brock Lesnar when they were training together. No, dude, he's a black belt level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu artists. He just, you know what I mean? He learned everything from like Jeremy Horn and from MMA classes and you know, catch wrestling. He does a lot of wrestling submissions too. Like the one he put Ricardo Almeida with, he put them out. Remember that Ricardo? Uh, he got him in that, um, uh, the, um, it was the Schultz headlock and he just fucking cranked it down to the beautiful and put them out, you know, and made it even know.

Speaker 2:          02:18:50       He didn't even know he's in danger. He didn't even freak outs, you know. Yeah. It's ridiculous. So I remember watching when he first started fighting in the UFC and I'm just like, man, these guys are common man. I always knew they were around. I always knew from my time in wrestling, there was always guys that would, we would go to the states and, you know, watch like the best guys in the states go out of the division champions so fast and so and just so flexible. Yeah. The kid in our, um, we had a kid in our, um, our, our, when I was a sophomore, when I was a sophomore in high school, we had one kid that was in like national level. It's a who smoked cigarettes too, by the way. Mark Collins. And he was a great fucking car, like a really passionate dude.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       And I remember one time, uh, uh, believe the coach's name was Hurwitz. I believe that was, it was her wits end. Uh, the other guy was, fuck the Irish, fuck, I can't remember his name, but hold on, Hook this mark calling guy would have this fucking crazy practice and everybody would be dying. Hands on their knees and calling would run across the fucking room and slide down on his knees and go, come on, let's go. Who's next? And just wanted to, wanted to keep wrestling learned, keep going, want to keep drilling. And the coach pointed at him and he goes, there's guys like that in every weight class. He goes, get, you better get that in your head. There's guys like that in every weight class. And I remember realizing myself, you know, being 14 years old or whatever I was, you know, it was either 14 or 15, and I was looking at him and I was killing my God like this.

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       Yeah, you gotta know, you gotta know that there's dudes out there that are willing to take it like that. They're willing to go that far. Coach Murphy, that was the Irish guy and Murphy was always trying to get me to play football. I'm like, bitch, are you crazy? I am a small person. There's a dude on our wrestling team that was also playing football. His name was Bob Baker. He was 300 fucking pounds in high school. I wrestled one 34 I don't want to lose this fucking giant dude. Someone on another squash on top of me. Fuck that man. Oh my God to for one season. I was so afraid. I just seeing these huge guys run at me. I was like, I'm so dangerous. Man has made a paper. It's such as such a dangerous sport. I mean, people love it and everything now, but charging into guys.

Speaker 2:          02:20:58       My 14 year old who I've worked here on nephew is, is 185 pounds and he's six foot one and he squats to 85 for reps. Okay. He's 14 and he's a giant Jesus and he plays football and I watched that. I watched him play Jv. He's only 14 and I watched, I watched those kids hit each other and I was like, nobody's heads built for this. I told his dad, I go, look, he's a monster and amount of there, get him out of there and get a good amount of it in a minute fighting and he plays guitar. Let him play guitar. They don't even know how bad the damage is until these guys die. Yeah. You remember that guy that fell off of his back of his girls? His truck had it. He had an old man's brain and an old man's like rotten brain and it showed like, you know all this degeneration 23 or something.

Speaker 2:          02:21:36       I think he was 25 but yeah, close enough. I mean it's insane. These guys have been doing this device school. Exactly. It's not even a layman alignment or or running. I have a friend who was an alignment and he said back in the day when he was to play in college, he, they didn't allow you to use your hands so you couldn't push guys. You would slam head to head with guys. Is that true? Does that make any sense? Use Your hands. You always use your hands always. Is there anything different than what you couldn't cause he was telling me that the pig gets spiked guys in the chest with the big difference is that now in football you can't have a helmet to helmet contact. You can't do it deliberately. So if you hit somebody, you tackle somebody and a lot of guys just to run at you and they'd hit you with their helmet and you always allowed to use your hands and push guys where you will have to do, you have to unblock them on the line.

Speaker 2:          02:22:22       You can use your hands. But yeah, you typically held your hands this way. But what are the rules? Can you grab a guy and fucking on Juno is asking me about office all offense. You cannot do that on defense. Kenyon, you know, holding on offense and defense. Offense, you can grab and move. You can pull people out of the way. So on defensive of dudes coming at you can judo his ass. Yes. Really? You can grab his clothes and fucking hip toss on. Yeah. But it's really hard to do. Cause those guys know what the fuck they're doing. Yeah, no shit. Right? Yeah. That's one of the craziest thing is when you see some nutty running back, one of those fucking freaks, one of those incredible specimens. And I remember this one where Peterson dudes were trying to get ahold of them and he's spinning.

Speaker 2:          02:22:56       He keeps spinning. Adrian Peterson tried to grab a hold of me. He just spins out of their hands. Oh Adrian Peterson sprinting with a shirt off. There's like a, there's I've commercial. And just take a look at the physicality is a guy who was so fast, he runs I think 27 miles an hour or something like 20 what is the human athlete going to look like a hundred years from now? A lot of things going on like, like Venus and Serena Williams. Okay, they're going to have sex and they're gonna make a baby. And I can only hope they have sex with some Olympic athlete motherfucker. And we see what's possible. And everybody just keeps doing that until the point where that just becomes, you know, the, the, the number one seed on the planet earth and just see what is possible with this human form. I got to come to that because we're going to have two things.

Speaker 2:          02:23:37       You're going to have training methods of course, and nutrition and all that. Nano bots and shit. Genetic engineering. Yeah. Science is going to step in and take care of everything that nature, manipulation, myostatin inhibitors, all those things. If we think that you know that the stock market crash is a wake up call, wait, so the genetic crash comes, have 400 pound linemen, 500 pound linemen. We're going to have to fucking women that are 10 feet tall, squashing men on the head. Dad Way. Could you imagine if some woman became a like a mad crazy man hater and they genetically engineered a way for her to be like a check of the giants? How big giant. It's huge. What are you gonna do? Are you going to fuck around with you, Tanya? She's going to use you like a Dildo and just grab you by your little ass hole and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:24:16       You inside her pussy. I do imagine if there was like some, if you could just decide I want to be a 10 foot tall woman because men have been fucking with me. I'm just going to walk around and kicking guys and the ball and shove them with other animals. Your genetic structure with other animals. That's what's interesting. The idea is can you stop that technology from getting to that point and can you keep it out of the hands of a person who would use it for a terrible thing? Probably not. Probably not. Right. You think everything will look at this. I mean there's laptops that were, we use just your phone. Your phone has like so much more power than anything that existed in the 1960s but everybody's going to have access to it. So everything is going to come up together just like computers.

Speaker 2:          02:24:51       But will there come a time where we have to stop people from becoming 10 foot tall attack of the giant women's stomping on dudes and shit? I mean, what could you imagine if there the manipulation of actual physical life, if it actually gets to a point where you can design what you want to look like and like you can say, mom, Dad, I've decided to be one of the blue people from Avatar and you just decided the Pentagon is definitely the thing. Trying to figure out ways to create super soldiers, whether it's a cloning or tissue regeneration and yeah, but I mean what if I forgot about super soldiers? How about things that don't even exist? You can make things that you could become a dragon. You know, like I want to be a dragon. That's what, that's what Craig Venter, Craig Venter, the guy who created that synthetic biology quick vendors team that the implications are 21 years.

Speaker 2:          02:25:33       Is this the guy who created um, um, it's made out of metal or is he the guy who so poor? Basically I'm a synthetic form of bacteria. That was, that was basically, it's a host genetic blueprint was created on a computer. It's synthetic biology. And, and the idea is that anything you can conceive of a human being can make. Do you know that scientists have been able to grow sperm and the laboratory dish? Yes, I do. Your time was up, son. I know our time on this planet as men, we will no longer be useful. Just that biology is going to be an antiquated and antiquated machine controlled by technology. It's going to be some mad rush to see who can dominate whatever aspect of this new reality comes up. Because if there's no morality and there's no humans that are in control of it, clearly it's going to get to a point where it's gonna.

Speaker 2:          02:26:19       It's gonna be wild, wild west for genetic manipulation. But also the idea is that if you're going to live that long, what does that say about your earning power? You've got to make a lot of fucking money for a long time. You know, you know that a Apple's got, you know, we're not going to be able to, we're not going to need to charge our phones anymore. They have flow cells. They have the patch. It's going to blow up on your patent from fuel cells and every two weeks you'll take an action. Cautious ago. Check. That'd be set for two weeks. What I'm going to pay, I'll be really, it's going to be that. That crazy. Yup. Why don't you just hold your pee and we'll wrap this bitch up. No, a la based comic. Angelo Bowers. No, he had died today. What does he know?

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       Immediately hung out at the comedy store a lot and stuff like that. I don't know the exact details, but I think he might've been in a car with another friend of ours who we talked about earlier in the podcast, Josh, Adam Meyers and maybe a drunk driver hit him, but I don't know if that's real. Do you have a picture? Yeah, I don't know. I that's, that's songs. Recipes to Fred James Too. I don't, I don't know that dude, but fat. Well maybe I might have met him before. I'm not sure, but Fed James. I knew very well. You Remember Fred James Comedy store? I should do. He was one of the first person I met. No, he looks like a, like Andrew dice clay, but squished in fat jolly guy. Nice guy. Yeah, he passed away unfortunately. He was a great dude. So rest in peace. Fet, James.

Speaker 2:          02:27:40       Um, uh, thank you to Brian Callin for coming by brother. Always like whenever I think you know, you're just like Joey Diaz, a Bert Kreischer when a or Duncan Trussell whatever thing you're out of. Interesting Shit to talk about. You come with a wave of new things and I swear, man, when you were talking about the Holocaust, I've always been aware of the holocaust of course, but there's something about the way you were describing it that it was put, it was shining like some extra light on how fucking crazy and barbaric it was really like you were, you were saying, it's so eloquently, it really made me like really tuned in to how chaotic and Insane and disgusting and horrific it really was. It's really was and, and important to keep in mind. Also the lesson to the Holocaust is that it can happen again in some form or another human beings when you give people power over you over you.

Speaker 2:          02:28:27       Yeah. Uh, you, you, they'll, they'll take advantage and it sounds melodramatic, but something like the Nda actually does that. It's, it's not what the constitution is the first step. It's not how it was founded. The country, they knew that the people who founded this country knew that shit could go wrong. And so they had a bunch of things in place. And one of the things that Benjamin Franklin said, and she never forget this, that he who would sacrifice liberty for security deserves neither. Oh, that's a good way to end this podcast. I love that. Say that again. He who would sacrifice liberty for security deserves neither. They knew back then. Man. Someone's going to play a shell game on you, man. They're going to tell you this, some bad people out there. We need to look at your email to protect you from them. That's right.

Speaker 2:          02:29:06       Those Fox get your own porn. Thank you to liberty, liberty, liberty, and justice for all. One of the most important things that people forget, and that's the issue of a liberty God damn constitution. All right. It's the bill of rights. It's in the, the idea that this country was founded on, they got away from a system that's sucked and they said, let's make one for the fucking people, by the people, for the people, by the people. And now it's become for the corporations and lobbying groups and lobbying groups and cunts. It's for the cuts. He just stopped the Kuntz. We could be okay. Fleshlight stop the cont start fucking training on it. Nick Diaz, camp camping, just started balling. They'll kill you. They'll kill, you know, there'll be nice to make sure I'll be, I'll make 'em laugh. Thank you to the fleshlight for sponsoring our podcast.

Stop playing games. Just go ahead and auto one. And when you know, when you're not in your little fake vagina thing and you're like, oh, you'd be like, Joe Rogan was right. If you make this this, ah, I usually go fucking crazy silver back when I thought, you know what, I sound like, I sound like I stubbed my toe. Oh my God, I like to let six notes quickly. Jimmy Burke, I heard him, I heard him having sex one time and he goes, oh, oh God bless America. That's the thing. When he blows Jimmy Burke, I was like, Jesus, Jim, thank you to [inaudible] dot com makers of Alpha, brain, shroom, tech, sport, shroom, tech, immune and new mood, all different types of supplements for different things.

Speaker 2:          02:30:49       Alpha brain, is it cognitive enhancing supplement? No. Mood is a serotonin boosting, serotonin boost, boosting supplement, and then of course a shroom tech. Shroom tech sport is the one that's for people who are like seriously in to working out. If you're not, skip that. And then shroom, tick immune is a fascinating one where it fires up your immune system because it recognizes the mushroom that you're eating as some sort of a a possible threat. And then it gears up for a fight that never takes place, leaving you with a charge of immune system. Pretty wicked from what I understand. But I don't understand any of this shit. I'm just talking
