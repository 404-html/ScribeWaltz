Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah, my oldest one's super. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Ben And ladies, gentlemen, Dude, I've talked about you on this podcast. It at least a dozen times. You are the number one guy that I'm most disappointed, never fought in the UFC. Yeah. I always get, whenever you talk about me, I get like 15 texts. Like, hey Joe, Joe talking about you now and you know, they'll send me clips or whatever. So obviously appreciate that. Um, but yeah, I never, I never really got to fight those top guys and it was for reasons beyond my control. Yeah. And you're done now. Yeah, I saw, I said, I said, I don't want to say I'm done period. I said I'm done excluding the fact that I get to fight and prove I'm number one. That would be the excluding facts. So if you could get in the UFC, you'd be willing to do it again.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       I mean, I don't care where it is. Right. I, I really genuinely don't. And obviously that would be the, the thing that makes sense. But there is legislation like the alley act and the things going through. So I don't know that maybe, you know, I'm still 33 so I'm not old. And you know, polluted GSP took four years off from one flight to the next fight. So I'm not saying I'm an age overnight. Well your style to you avoided so much damage. I didn't get, I didn't get hit once this until of 2017 so yeah, I think you hit once in three fights. So yeah, I should tell people you were fighting in one FC, which is a big Asian organization. It's like the Asian version of the UFC. Yeah. So one FC started in 2012 I think. Um, obviously my contract with Belcher came up in 2013 and then there was that negotiation process and stuff obviously went south.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       And what happened there? You were the champ of belt or, and then all sudden you left and you are still undefeated, right? I'm undefeated 18. You know what the fuck happened? That pellet tour let the champion will go. That wasn't what happened. So no, there's so much misinformation out there. And you know, I, I'm popular but I'm not that popular. And so lots of times in my story gets missed toll because I get spoken over by other people. Right. And they don't hear what I say. So here, here's what happened. Um, obviously, so prior to me and Bella tour, Hector and Eddie were the ones that left, right? There were, Hector was the lumber yard and Eddie Alvarez, Alvarez, both of them, both the middleweight champion than the lightweight champion. They both got taken care of pretty well. But if you, if you remembered Eddie's situation, I don't know if you remember this, he got an offer from the UFC still under the matching period of Beltre.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Beltre says we matched it. Right. And in terms of what was in the contract, it was matched. Right? But because Belterra has no paper view venue, well if you have c says we'll pay you on pay per view belts as well. We will too. But that's not real life. That's still patients. They've done two paper view shows ever and they've never met any type of threshold. So you know, they say imagine, but it doesn't say, I don't know if you remember, but they went to court over it and the UFC one Eddie has got the right to, I'm sorry he didn't, when he, he somehow did it like a one more fight in Bellator and then went to the UFC. I don't know exactly what the finality of that case was. But anyways, when that happened, his, his

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       contract became public knowledge. Right. And so a lot of UFC fighters were pissed because he, they gave him a whole bunch of money. And so when I was 12 and older, I will, I have my last fight in belt organs down under crush cough, July 30th May 31st of 2013 beat him up pretty good. And then I had a 12 month matching period. And so what was expressed to me by the UFC brass was that you need to get rid of your matching clause and we will make you an offer, but we will not make you an offer until that happens. Get rid of your matching. Yes. How do you do that? Well, here, here's how I went about doing it. I exist 12 months. Right. That's a freaking, I'm not going to sell for 12 months. So I'd call Bjorn or did it and say, Hey Bjorn, I'm not gonna resign.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       Please let one guy who was running belt or correct. Yeah. And now he, you know, he got fired. But um, and Bjorn had a terrible reputation, but I never, I had a decent relationship with them. I never like butted heads too bad. So every tear this had Bjorn, let me go. I'm not coming back. And then so everyone says it will bell toward, didn't want to reassign me. Well that's, that's not true at all. Every day is Bjorn. Let me go. If you aren't, let me go, because you know, I love challenges. What I love more than anything in the world is a challenge myself. If you look at my wrestling career, that's what it's all about. Taking the next best thing every single time. And so, yeah. So finally in and all this time, you know, Dana and the UFC is saying, we want Ben to ask him, we won't been ask her.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       And I'm ranked number seven in the world or you know, somewhere around there, 12 and [inaudible]. And so I remember I was going to the Asian food store cause I was gonna make some Tom cost soup and Bjorn calls me, said, you're released full, full, you're released, you can go. And I have to say, I appreciate that. So Friday morning, it was Thursday night, Friday morning, it's in November, sometime in May, mid November, um, morning they fax over the release, my management faxes it to UFC headquarters and all of a sudden that afternoon there's a, you know, like a little scrum where everyone's asking Tina questions and the dentist says, we're not interested in Ben [inaudible]. And I said, wait, what just happened there? Right. Because for the last three months they were saying, we were interested, where's your, where's your where's did now I finally produced this full release from Bella tour that I got and now they're not interested.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       And so I said, wow, I just got caught in the middle of this. And uh, was there a reason given? Well, so, okay, so the Monday, so then I say f that I buy my potato, I bought a plane ticket to Vegas for Monday, so that was Friday. That happens. I say, fuck that. I'm going to Vegas. I'm not taking this shit, you know. So, uh, Monday I buy my plane ticket to Vegas, I fly out to Vegas to UFC headquarters. Uh, I met with Lorenzo. Dana was on the little speakerphone dealy and they offered me a, a zoo for contract, but it would be confidential and I would have to fight one fight for the world series of fighting, which is like, well that's bizarre. What? Yeah. And they said, didn't fight for the world series a funding the exact relationship with the world series the world. I don't like a feed organization at that time. Something, yeah, I mean I, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:06:01       Marlin Mris. Just engage you both those guys came from champs over there.

Speaker 2:          00:06:05       Yeah. I think the relationship was, is very hazy between the old world series of fighting in the UFC because there was also, people don't want the other way. Right. Andre Arlovski gets dropped from the FC goes to world series. I, Anthony Johnson, boom. All these people. Yeah. So they say one fight, one fight, world series of fighting. We will pay Zoopla, we'll pay you, what'd you do? One fight. Okay. I say let that's F it up, but okay. I said, I don't think anyone's going to go for it. I'll do it. So I leave and about six hours later I got a phone call. Is that deal is no longer available. We are not going to make you an offer. Yeah. So, wow. And you have no idea why? Well, I, I, so I, here's my guess. I've never got to sit face to face. And you didn't say, what was your problem with me?

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       I think there's four things. My mind. Number one, he didn't really like me. Um, stemming from the, I called them out on the steroid thing, you know, where he said it's impossible. And this is where our disagreement, it's impossible to test all UFC athletes. I said, well that's not true. You cited does it all over the world for all kinds of athletes. Right. You can do it. It's just expensive. But let's just call it what it is. You're a private business. You don't have to do drug testing. And it's obviously they do it now. Do it now. Yeah. Do it through Usada. So you were totally right. Yeah. So I, I was correct and now, but that was, you know when Dana is wrong in an argument and he's got this huge army that follows him and he said, I'd rather hit, I think his quote was bad cause I'd rather watch flies fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       And Ben ask him fight. You know, I think he said something like ambien takes, Ben asked her, he goes asleep. Yeah. There, there's a few of them. So the personal attack started, right. So that, that's number one. Number two, my fighting style is not highly attractive, but I also think that's a little bit of fake news because if you look at George St peers to consistently novelty, McGregor trumped him. But only a couple of times, but if you will get consistent basis. George Saint Pierre is the number one draw of all time. He heavily relied on take downs and ground and pound. I mean he didn't have a finish in like five years or something. Let me

Speaker 3:          00:08:00       say what my take is always been on you and that style is that it's important and that it really, it really works. Yeah, absolutely. You're able to do really works, and I've always said this and it was proven son a Saturday night in the steep Emile Chick Francis Econo fight. Wrestling is the most important part of MMA. Absolute ability to take the fight to the ground. Obviously Steve Bay has a lot of other attributes. He took tremendous punches in that fight. I mean, I know you didn't get a chance to watch it, but I saw some highlights. The Holy Shit. I mean the first round was chaos. I mean Francis and Gannon was a terrifying guy and Steve Bay took the shots, use great movement, you striking of his own, but most importantly after a while God is wrestling going. And then once he got in God but to the ground and gone, I didn't have any answers.

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       He didn't know what to do. What your, what you've been able to do to guys like Douglas Lema who just fought Rory macdonald for the bell to our title. Really good fight of course golf who is another fantastic fight who uh, you know, it was beaten a lot of really top guys. Yeah. You're able to use your wrestling and completely nullify all, they're striking an offense and that's a huge part of fighting. Fighting is not what's exciting for people to watch. Fighting is what actually works and what you've been able to do time and time again is take these guys who looked like world beaters and completely nullify their offense, taken to the ground and beat the shit out of him. Yeah, that's huge. That's very, very important.

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       Yeah, absolutely. And so, you know, not so we can get back to the UFC thing, but so yeah. I mean when I started fighting, right, it was just like, hey, let's go fight. I didn't live in a coaching. And so I didn't move to Duke's until to Souk Rufus. Yes. Until 2010 I think. So I started, no, no, no. 2011 I'm sorry. Cause I was in Arizona. I was coaching for Arizona State University. But when I moved there, I know, hey, the I, there's a lot of elite strikers in this gym. I said, but I, I'm never going to be elite striker. But if no one can hit me, they can't beat me. They're not gonna outlast me. They're not going to help her. Apple, me, they're not going to beat me if they can't knock me out. They're not going to beat me. Plain and simple.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       So my whole goal was how do I not get hit? Not, I don't need to be a great striker hitting people. I just need to not get hit. If you can't knock me out, I'm going to eventually get you on the ground and I'm going to beat your ass. Right. And so that was kind of my whole goal when I got an amaze, how do I not get knocked out? Right. And so you said, obviously I've found a really good way to do that. And it added a lot of longevity in my career where I wasn't taking damage a, a lot of other people were taking. And I think there's also a lot of other things to being a really high level wrestler that, you know, besides obviously you can control where the fight happens, right? But there's a lot of other things that high level wrestling provides us, right.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       That came from that world that other disciplines don't get. You know, a lot of competition. We compete thousands of times. Right? How to get our mind right. Um, these wrestlers are just strong and then there's just a different strength that he's actually, I got to go work how term Burroughs last week cause a many time world champ. And it's like you forget how strong wrestlers are. Like you grab him, you're like, good God, this guy is like, you know, I don't feel that from him. Maybe people like grab him and I'm like, oh my, everywhere. It's like there's no worries. Week. Um, very, very disciplined. Right? Cause a wrestlers, like we've been in the system from youth wrestling to high school wrestling to college. I said, well, we're under, you know, coaches and have a very strict training plan and understand how to put a training regimen together where a lot of other martial arts don't have that kind of structured system. So I think there's a lot of advantages that we as a wrestlers have when we come in mixed martial arts.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       And if I could add to that, the intention is pure, it's pure for competition because there's no financial reward. It's not a bunch of people that are getting into wrestling because they want to get rich. It's a bunch of people that really want to prove that they're the best. And so you have so many top flight guys that are incredibly mentally strong feeding off of each other, knowing that they're going to be competing against each other and almost no financial possibilities except for coaching.

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       Well, yeah, there's, I mean now, so 2018 to 20, uh, 2008 when I was wrestling and then when I decide to make that jump MMA, there is a lot better financial structure for senior level athletes. No, none of them are getting rich and there's only about a dozen and I'm making like a decent living. Right? Yeah. And so which is crazy. There's thousands of wrestlers. Exactly. So your points mostly correct, but there are a handful of top United States athletes now who can do nothing but wrestle. Where when I was in, in 2008 when I was trained, that wasn't even the case. I had to go do camps. I was coaching at Missouri, so I was doing other things in addition to wrestling. So like a top Olympic athlete. What else would they do to make money? Well, so like in 2008 I was doing a lot of camps, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       You'd travel around the country, do camps, make money, coach a college team. I was making money that way. So the handful of things I didn't like w w it wasn't just wake up and train every single day. But the athletes today that you were saying now that's what they're doing. That's it. Coaching and different things. No, no, no, no, no. Some of them don't have to. Anything you're saying that just do it from where are they getting the money? Jordan Burroughs and James Green for example. Um, sponsorships are slightly more lucrative than they were. Then there's something called the regional training center system. Um, which, you know, most major colleges have one that's a lot more lucrative and that's fundraising, right? They're not, they're not earning money that the RTC people go say, hey, rich guy, would you like to fund this program? That'll help us develop Olympic level athletes.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       Sure. Okay. Right. And then the United States, uh, you soc has slightly more funding given to USA wrestling than in the past. Well, it's the tragic story of John Dupont. I mean, that's literally why that whole, if people have seen that movie, what was that movie called? Fox got Fox catcher. Yeah. Awful crazy story of, um, Dave and Mark Schultz. And this millionaire or billionaire crazy guy, I believe in her and wound up shooting Dave Schultz and uh, was just Weirdo guy that was running this camp. And these guys kind of got stuck training with this gap because I mean, and that's 96 was when Schultes got shot. Right. And so that's 12 years prior to, you know, my Olympic birth and, and so then it's even worse. I mean, these guys are literally making nothing and that then, you know, then we'll go back to the argument of amateurism and the Olympics is stupid, which was abolished like 92 of the Dream Team was kind of totally abolished tourism.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       But yeah, those guys in that era, that 84, 88, 92 nights, they were making nothing. And so when this guy, John Dupont offers them money and stipends and places to live, they don't really have a better option. And it's freaking sad to be honest about it. And then obviously USA wrestling sanctioned him because he gave you as a wrestling a lot of money. So yeah, it was really bad thing. And, and so we're doing a lot better in 2018 than we were 10 years ago. And Way, way better than we were doing 20 years ago. Yeah. The Olympic thing where they try to treat the Olympics like it's an amateur sport event. It's a business you're making absolutely ins and billions of dollars off these athletes who get paid zero is to me it's disgusting. I think it's just this relic of ancient thinking and these guys are using it to steal money from young athletes. That's what I think.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       I think the hard thing is theft. Yeah. I usually don't know whom. Who's more evil that you soc or the IOC or the NCA. Cause the NCA runs right along the same lines. And I think both are pretty evil and both are archaic and both DDB changing. And you know, if you could abolish the NCA and the IOC, that'd be fantastic for athletes worldwide. Yeah. Well especially when you look at the football teams that are getting literally billions and billions of dollars every year and these athletes are ruining their lives. I mean you have football players that maybe play one, two seasons if they're lucky, if they get their back blown out, their legs get blown out and then they never have an NFL career. And meanwhile the university has made tons of money, tons of money and they make nothing. Yeah. And to make that even worse, cause I actually had to, I had a whole podcast about this argument with someone and to make that end, we're on the same side of this, but to make it even worse, if you're an NCAA athlete, Joe, you can't even make money off your own image and likeness.

Speaker 4:          00:15:46       You can't have a youtube channel. It's crazy. It's so not only will they not pay you anything, which I think we can debate and argue on that, but the fact that they can't make money off their own name, own image and likeness it, that's, it should be criminal for that to happen. Jimmy, you were telling me about this, right? Like a guy got in trouble for having a youtube channel where it was punter for like an a college football team or a kicker. I remember his name, I don't remember his name, it on and there was a, there was a wrestler from the University of want to say University of Minnesota. He made a rap album and he had to either quit the wrestling team or or donate all the money back or something like that. It's like rap, rap, rap and wrestling have, they have nothing to do with each other.

Speaker 4:          00:16:27       The fact that he can't go make money off freaking recording an album is like mind blowing. It's disgusting because you're keeping a kid from being industrious. You keeping a a young guy. I was trying to find his way through the world. You keeping them from being successful and, but though that kind of success like figuring out a way to make some money off of that other name, doing rap that could lead to all sorts of paths in life. Like he's, he's learning as a young guy like, hey look, I could be industrious. I could go do this. I can be creative. I can go do that. Like this is what we should be encouraging people to do to take chances and make money. The idea that you're saying like somehow or another this spoils his amateur athletic standing. It's just stupidity. I think it's fucking disgusting.

Speaker 4:          00:17:06       It drives me nuts. Agree a hundred percent. It just drives me crazy. So we're back to your situation with the UFC. So the UFC says we're not offer no offer, no offer. So tours release too. So I, I had spent three months telling Pella Tor, do you think you played, you feel like the USC might've played a little way? They played me harder sell. Okay. So number the reasons Dan doesn't like me, number one. Number two, my style and not that great. Right? Didn't you say something like he's a bald steroid? It was mostly after the fact, after that went down that I really torture him. But um, you know, but the, the original one was, he's lying about this, the Usada thing. So that was the simpler the, those people who say me and Dana had beef prior to me

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       not getting it off.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       Have you met him? Yeah, I mean, yeah. Not Talk to him. We've never had at length conversation. So great guy. Well the wrong impression of him. I mean, I really love it that yeah, you and I have had different experiences. I always feel like I should be there when people have experienced, let me let you know the Dana. I know. Yeah. So, um, so that would be too

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       three. I think obviously stealing a key piece away from Bella tour was important to them. Um, and then number four, I think they thought I really had the ability to be their champion and if someone can be a belt or champion and make this transition directly to the FC and then be the UFC champion. I, you know, they remember this when they're going on filters down spike now that bell toward, use that to say, look, we're the same. He was a champion here. He's a champion there. So I think those four things are, and I've, Hey, I've never got to sit down face to face day in and say, why was there no offer? That one I've never got, you know, like when Anthony Pettis was the champ and you know, I'm helping coach him or tire was, I, I've haven't had more than five words a day in passing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:50       Right. And so it would be really interesting to me to sit down and say what was tell me for real, cause I have my assumptions on what the deal was, but I don't really know. And then if I have to add number five, number five is I think he got the idea that I would never be a yes man, which I'm not going to be. Never would be. Um, where Dana really kind of likes the yes man champion. I mean he, you see he's got, he's got some heat with Tyron. He's got some heat with steep bay as we saw on Saturday night. And he dated really struggles with the personalities that won't cater to what he wants to happen. Well,

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       fighters very rarely are yes men. Then that's by nature of who they are a little bit. Yeah. You know, especially the really good ones, especially as things start going well and start going their way. They realize they're the fucking man. I mean this is, if you're the guy was running the division, you're the guy who's running the division and then you're not going to take any shit from anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       Yeah. But that's [inaudible] you see as some of these guys ascend right up the ranks, they do. Like John Jones started having trouble with Dana. Right. But didn't have it

Speaker 4:          00:19:47       till he was Jones was having his problems I think had very little to do with Dana and more to do with his actions outside of the cage. I mean inside the octagon he was and the way he was promoted, he was promoted. Fantastic. But he's just crazy. John's crazy. You know John John needs a babysitter. The baddest motherfucker at 205 ever. He just needs an ear. Let him drive a car anymore. When you got that much money, it's beyond me like pace the, pay your buddy 40 grand a year and have him drive you permanently. Like why he was driving his own car. That one's beyond me. Well, they didn't know until they bought him a Bentley and then he wrapped around a tree. But that's when, that's when they should have known. And then, but then there was the other one where he hit and that was at the hit and run was after that one up. The hit and run was after that one. And then there was the other one we got pulled over speeding. And it's good that he told the cop to go fuck himself. Terrible decision. Two ways. A fucking wild dude. That's why he's so good. But then one of the reasons why he's, but then you put, you got to

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       put safeguards in place, right? Like, like you're making how many million a year? Multiple. At least for sure. You can't pay someone 40 grand to drive you around.

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       You're preaching to the choir. I mean, I wish I could clone me and send me all to all these camps on top. John, listen to me. Everything's gonna be fine. I've got a driver, we've got a Cadillac and escalate out here. Wherever you want to go. We're going places. We're going to have some fun. But no driving, no driving, no none. We don't need driving. We've got [inaudible] we've got fun. Let's go. Oh my gosh. I mean, seriously. Yeah. Well that's what you would have if you know you had like, you know, it's, I dunno what he's doing. I don't know. I never been to Albuquerque. I don't know how he's living, but he can't babysit everybody. You got the UFC has 500 fighters on its roster. I mean, how many of those guys are prone to wild behavior? I would say,

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       yeah. Yeah. Most of them. Right? High risk males at playing a sport where you have the potential to be heard every single time you step out on the job. Yeah. But when you're making millions of dollars, you got to put safeguards against yourself. Yeah. But I think also what

Speaker 3:          00:21:52       makes John so good is his self confidence and he probably, he's like, ah, I got it. Yeah, I fucked up before, but I got it now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       So I'm really into sports psychology and I want someone to write this book because no one's ever written it. But I think there's this, uh, I call it the hypocritical elite athlete. So there's two sides to every coin, right? And if you're a really elite athlete, you need both sides of those corner. And I'll give you a great example because this is kind of what you're talking about. There's these guys who are ultra elite prepares the eat, right? They sleep right, they train, right? They do everything right, right? But then if one little thing goes wrong, it messes with them, right? If they don't get the right food or their weight cuts bad, they start panicking, right? And then on the opposite side of the coin, there's these cowboys, right? And they're just like, I'm not going to eat right. I'm not going to sleep right.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       I'm not gonna do anything, right? But when time the step of the cage, I'm a fight my ass off and nothing's going to bother me, right? And so you need, you need both sides of those coins to make, to make it whole. And so you want someone ideally who does everything right, but at the same time when when something goes wrong or their toe hurts or whatever, they can just say, well, it doesn't really matter. I'm going to go compete anyways. Right. You want to have both sides of those. And that's where I think a lot of the UFC fighters are more on the cowboy side of it. Like, well, I'm not really gonna do a lot of things right, but I'm just going to go, I'm on fire. I'm just, we'll fight like cowboy Debbie, a fantastic example. This, yeah, the namesake of my argument.

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       Yeah, that's a good point. And it, it is, uh, it's probably one of the more fascinating things about any form of high stress, high level competition is there's no real guidelines of how to prepare your mind. You know? I mean, everybody teaches you how to wrestle every teaches you how to kickbox. There's all these martial arts schools. A teacher technique is very few real like rock solid programs of a how to, how to manage your mind. Absolutely. Like, I think you should be taught almost like in, in, in a step by step basis. Like, Hey, you get a flat tire, do you kick your car and scream or do you just go, this is what it is. And Hey, I could have been born in Ethiopia with no, right. I could be living in a fucking coal mine somewhere. No, I'm lucky. I'm fortunate. This is thing. This is a minor setback.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       No. And so like I actually started going to graduate school for sports psychology. I got nine of the 36 credits done and then I actually got a scholarship to go further and, and you know, get paid for. Um, but I was just, I was traveling so much, that was 2007, eight when I was trying to make the Olympic team and I was gone all the time. And then once I was out of school for a year, I was just like, there's no freaking way I'm going there. I'm not going back to school. I'm not going to sit in a class. You're not going to freaking write papers. I'll still study sports psych on my own, right? And so actually every Monday I do something called the mental Monday and one of my Facebook pages and just people message me questions and I talk about the mental aspect because you're right, there aren't enough people that talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       And then, you know, written wrestling is actually this company that's being highly successful, I'll call wrestling mindset. And they have a training program for athletes' minds because you're right, there's nothing out there. Is there a website for this? Yeah, right. It's rest of mindset.com. No kidding. That's great. And they're starting to s that'll apply to everything, but well, they're starting to explain, expand in a different disciplines. But you're right, I think, I think there's these general principles of sports psych, which can kind of go into any domain, right? And you're, you're 100% correct that every single individual is different. Right. And one of the, like for me, uh, um, I'm an overthinker, right? I'm obsessive. I'll do something over and over and over and over it again. Right? And so, like when I was 14 I was at this big national tournament and I was obsessing about who I'd have to wrestle and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       And it wore me out mentally. I got my ass kicked right. And my coach said, hey, I was that person many, many years ago. And it helped me just to talk about fishing. Right. Cause that maybe, cause I, if I don't think, I don't want to think about what I'm gonna do, I'm not one of those guys because I think about it too much. All obsessed. And so ever since age 15 I've, I've always taught myself a train myself to not think about the competition within like, you know, six hours, right? So maybe the day before I can think about are a couple of days before I got to think about it. But like, even when I'm in MMA locker room, I'm not thinking about my fight, my minds off of it. Because if I'm not, if I don't understand what my strategy is going to be by six hours before and I haven't trained myself by six hours before I fucked right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:02       I'm already fucked. Like, what am I going to do? Six hours. It's a brilliant strategy in six hours, you know, so like six hours. I intentionally fly people to my fights who are just my friends who have no intention of telling me what to do MMA wise and just want to pull shit backstage. Right? Because really smart keeps me really calm cause otherwise I start obsessing and that's going to lead to something really negative. So that's like one thing is where, you know, but some people are the opposite, like the f off too much. You kind of got to bring them back to focus. Right, right. You know, in other sports side concept is is what we'll learn. Gee, do you want go into the competition? Some people, you've got to get them amped up. Some people, most people you got to calm them down quite a bit. Like let's relax, let's execute because we need to

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       up. You're gonna execute. Right? So I think there's a lot of these sports psych concepts that can cross over many different genres. But you're right, no one trains you about it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:53       I think it's a huge part of the sport and it's, it's, it's overlooked because the sport is not just, and I think this is true with every sport, the sport's not just the movements that you make. It's what's going on inside the machine. Who, the manager of the body as the mind. And if the manager is like poorly formed and the structures all out of whack and you, you have like, whenever a problem comes up, you fall right into a pit. All these things should be addressed and you should develop this mindset, develop the ability to manage your mindset. And He, I think at a young age, I think it's, it's really critical.

Speaker 2:          00:27:25       Yeah. No, I totally agree. And you know, I think, I think one interesting thing, which I don't know if it's going to happen to them or now we'll see. Right? There's very few people who came from a wrestling background that are head coaches of MMA teams, right? Who came from this very, very structured environment of college wrestling. It's like you go to, I want you to remember my first training camp went to American top team in Florida. And I show up, it's 11 o'clock practice show, but 11 o'clock uh oh where's, where's everyone at? Right. And then we started 1145 like 45 minutes late. And then so the next day I'm like, well, am I assuming and charm and 1145 or should I show up at 11 because we say 1145 I can show up more. So I show up at 1130 and then they started 1120 you know, like what the hell where's in college wrestling?

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       If you're a minute late, you're going to get punished. And college wrestling, right. It's a very structured, organized system. So I'm very curious to see the day where there is an MMA team that is very structured like a college wrestling team would be, I think it would be very effective towards performance for athletes. And, but then again, you are going to have is a different structure because called dressers are poor, right? Where are you going to a bunch of MMA fighters who get rich and then say, well, I don't want to do what you're saying right now. How are you going to make them? Right? They're the one paying your paycheck. So it does become an interesting circumstance, but I think if there was someone who ran a highly structured, mixed martial arts team as structured as a college team, I think they would have a gigantic amount of success. I think their guys would get a lot better, a lot faster. Um, and I think you'd see a really interesting dynamic developed between the high level athletes and the coaches.

Speaker 3:          00:28:57       Well, I think they're still trying to, trying to figure out what's the best way to coach fighters. And I think everybody's got their own way of doing it. You know, for us, the hobbies, ways different than the way they do it at American top team. Matt Hume was doing it different than the way Duke does it. Everybody's got their own way. And the only way you could tell is how well the athletes compete. Yeah. That's the only way you really find out who's correct and who's need, who needs to make adjustment.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       Yeah. And it's really hard and in fighting, because I mean even your highest level camps, how many say Bella Torn Uca? How many high level MMA fights did they have per year? Maybe 30 and I think that'd be a lot for most of these teams. Right? And so you only get 30 samples sizes, right? Whereas the college wrestling team, you're going to have between everybody on the team, the all 40 guys, you're going to have at least a thousand matches every single year. Mint minimum. Right. And then obviously every event is scored by team. Every deal made is scored by team, every NCA championship scored by team. So you get a very good indication of what coaches are doing right and what coaches are doing it wrong. And then obviously with recruiting process, the coaching or doing a right now get the next crop of the best talent. Right. And so you have a very good idea of what's working, what is not working. We're in MMA. I think we struggle to see it because the sample size isn't large enough to give us a really, really direct correlation.

Speaker 3:          00:30:12       Now you were able to instigate your strategy in pretty much every single one of your MMA fights. The only fight where you really struggled as a j Heran turnoff fight. Yeah, absolutely. That was a close fight. What was different in that fight? Well, the, so that was the,

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       my first fight at dukes. Um, obviously Jane Iran is pretty damn good too. I really don't want to take that away from, I think he was right, number 16 the world or something at that point in time. That was my first fight at dukes. I think the biggest mistake I made, I mean, and obviously at that time, I'm literally two years into my fighting career, right? So I stopped wrestling completely. Um, I didn't do one wrestling practice. I moved to Duke's August for, well, I moved to Wisconsin August 1st search training, Duke's August 1st I fought, uh, three months later at the end of October. I literally did not do one wrestling practice. So what were you doing? Uh, I was just as striking like six times a week. I was doing Jujitsu a handful of times a week, and then I was doing conditioning instead after that fight in my rest.

Speaker 2:          00:31:04       Well, and then actually I went to, my brother was living in New York at the time, who my brother is also an NCAA champ and went to visit him for Thanksgiving and he whooped my ass and I'm like, I freaking suck at wrestling. Like, you know, like I went cold Turkey and so it's like, okay, I don't need to wrestle every day to be great at wrestling anymore, but I need, I need to wrestle once a week, twice a week with high level competition. So at that point in time, and for pretty much the rest of my career, I would go to one of the local colleges once a week or twice a week just to keep my skills sharp. And so I think that was the biggest mistake I made in the rom phase. I didn't wrestle at all prior to it. Um, but Jay, Ron was good. He was also a division one college wrestlers. He knew what he was doing also. Um, but I think if I, if I had to pinpoint one thing that that would be it

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       isn't it fascinating that a guy with as much wrestling the experiences you have, all you have to do is take some time off and everything degrades? Well, it's timing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       It's all timing. Right? So you, you take three months off your time, he's going to go to shit. I mean, literally amazing. Tell you I wasn't even one practice and it's like, but that was also what helped me get the striking thing down is I was doing, and this is what I think you actually made this point. A who the hell are you talking to about wrestlers are willing to go to the environment? I was striking six to seven times a week. How many strikers go and wrestle? Six to seven.

Speaker 3:          00:32:20       None of them. Do they want to leave? They refused to. Well, there was Francis in Ghana. It's training camp. When I talked to people outside, uh, afterwards, it's crazy. Before everyone was saying, oh my God, he's in tremendous shape. Everything's amazing. And then afterwards there was like, uh, he doesn't train on the ground. What he crazy train on the ground. Like all he wants to do is strike. Yeah. Well you can't let them do that. You can't split up. I can't let him, he's going to fight and a division one wrestler. Yeah. Like how is he going to do this? How is he going to, how is it going to stand up? He's going to somehow or another magically stuff. All the take downs. You have to train that. You have to train it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       Yeah. And well, and then, but you got to train it. But then even when people train it, the striker the hell, those strikers, they don't want to do it. Right, right. Like I said, when I go to Duke's, when I started at dukes and it went down to four times a week where we are striking, right. But in the beginning it was six or seven times a week sessions a week. I'm striking. Right. And so I'm immersed in that culture. I have to learn. You can't not learn me doing six to seven times a week and but the strikers, they want to do one restaurant practice a week to wrestling practice a week. Well if you're here and they're here, how are you going to catch them by doing one practice a week? It's freaking impossible. You need to, I mean if I, if I got to like be in charge of an MMA guys camp and I dunno, I, I coach wrestling, I love coaching the kids. I don't know if I ever want to coach Emma people I would consider for someone like high level, but you've got to immerse yourself. You literally have to take three months and freaking wrestle every single day because Russell, you've got to bill, you have to build those skills. You're not going an alert. You're not going to learn something well doing at one time a week. You are going to do it. Period.

Speaker 3:          00:33:55       No, I, I completely agree and I think that it, it all depends on what the athlete brings to the table. Like some guys have like a little bit of wrestling and then maybe they need to work more on submissions. Maybe some guys need to work more on their striking. They get hit too much. I mean it's, it's every single fighter is a, there's a different recipe and you have to figure out what that recipe is. And it's hard because it's like you only way you find out is how well they perform in competition. And how many times do you even get the chance to do that? Three a year. Three a year. Yeah, maybe.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       Yeah. And so, you know, that's, that's that. And listen, so I'm not saying, I'm not saying a striker has to do six sessions a week for three years straight, but I'm saying it take three months, take six months, immerse yourself in that, be obsessed, be obsessed, learn those skills, figure it out. And then after that, it might be once a week, twice a week, three times a week. But then when, when, when, when, when we start considering the, the CTE factors, which I'm not totally sold on, on CTE yet, cause you don't get hit. And you know, this guy, he's a poster boy for wrestling, martial art. If you really think of, yeah, no, for sure. But, so I watched, I watched concussion. I was actually flying to my fight in April of 2016 a wash. I said, shit, that's scary. I did, I spark two more times the rest of my career. So my crew was 19 more months. I spoke twice. I just didn't, I didn't do it just because you didn't want to get hit. Uh, yeah. I felt as an an an an an uh, an unnecessary risk.

Speaker 3:          00:35:18       Well, there was a recent study that came out, oh, just a few days ago that said that it's repeated subconcussive hits and they're causing CTE, not concussions.

Speaker 2:          00:35:27       Yeah. So the, but the study that made me really question the CTE phenomenon was they did that study where they studied a whole bunch of professional football players and it was like a hundred per se. It was like 99% have CT. Right. But then they studied people who had played football for any length of time. Yeah. Any length of time. And it was like still like 80% of the people and it's like, well f I can't live my life in a bubble. Right? Like are like how can 80% of people who have ever played football, I mean how many American males, what percentage of American males walking around at 40 years old today put some level of football? It's like gotta be 80% so you're telling me 70% of America is walking around with CTE? Yeah. Or the American males. Like that's crazy. But that's real. Come on really is what's happening. No, I buy, you've got, you've got to think there's gotta be some kind of low threshold because otherwise 40 years down the road, if everybody played football and everyone who played football has CTE, everyone's going to be walking around like there.

Speaker 3:          00:36:20       A lot of people are walking around like that. Come on, that's what's going on. Or is it a diet? It might be the Diet coke. A little bit, a little bit of that. I think way more people have some form of brain damage than I do. Well, I think in the world of martial arts, I know so many guys. Yeah, well let's talk about not martial artists are just regular people, ball players. I think football players, it's even worse because you're running, you're running at each other clashing heads. I mean you watch football, I mean the damage those guys take his crave. It's once in a UFC you'll see like a wild head kick, k boom and football games. These guys are literally running at each other. I mean it's crazy. One team's running this way, the other teams running that way and they slam into each other and these guys are 200 5,300 pounds that that impact that the jarring of your brain. Plus they have helmets on, which allows them to be more confident clashing into each other. I think a giant percentage of those guys.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       But you think, but so like I said, so if that one study said it was something around 80% of anyone who ever played any level of football field length of time for anything like that has CTE. That means like, I mean, if we take the American population, at least hit 2% of American men played football.

Speaker 3:          00:37:34       Yeah. They have CT. So we're talking about like a gigantic population. Yeah. I think there's levels of CTE though. I mean, I think, you know, you get to the point where you're like, Joe Frazier, he could barely talk before he died. Um, rest in peace. But then you also get two guys that are just like a little forgetful and don't know why, or impulsive and don't know why. You know, there's a lot of that, there's a lot of weird stuff that comes to CTE. I've studied it pretty extensively. Okay. And the more studies that I've read on it to more of [inaudible] gotten really

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       derby. So do you think there's maybe just a low threshold for what they call CTE?

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       Well, there's also genes that certain people have. What was that gene? Rhonda. Patrick talked about it. Uh, I don't remember what it was. Fantastic. She's amazing, right? Yeah. And she was talking about, uh, some jeans make you more susceptible for traumatic brain injury than other ones. Like if you have it, you are many times more likely develop CTE.

Speaker 2:          00:38:25       But then also, and then so the other thing that I would is out of curiosity to me when they did a CT studies, especially with they're doing, you know, after death with these football players, right? That were so now if they're dying, their pipe played in the sixties seventies eighties that time period, uh, steroid use very, very high and drug use is also very high in that culture and so, and and alcohol. I'm including drugs. So it's like, did those things contribute, contribute? Is it a, you know, is it like a mitigating factor or is it like going to create this crazy storm of brain damage that you're, you're going to freaking running into people like this. Then you're doing steroids, then you're a freaking drink and a pack of beer. Then you're doing some cocaine like

Speaker 3:          00:39:08       that. That can't be good for you. Right? Can that be good for you? Can't be, no, it can't be. Yeah. Especially the pills. A lot of them get caught or the pain pills if you're caught up on pain pills, that's a, that's a big one, man. We just found out a Tom petty died from fucking pain pills. My wife and I were talking about sad. That was that a man, he couldn't have a sense of a,

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       because at my wife and I both love Tom Petty music, but how he did, how, how at 66 years old, he was still like not so okay with himself that he was jamming pills down his throat, you know, that he didn't have a sense of, I have had great accomplishments. I've had to create life. You know, I have people around me that love me that, you know, I mean, it's gotta be a sad, lonely thing when you're overdosing on pills. I would have to assume,

Speaker 3:          00:39:49       well, I mean, I don't want to guess, but I would, I would imagine he's in some kind of pain if it was free, is taking those opiates hip fracture he was recovering from, ah, I got hooked on them, man. My friend from the amber from the UFC, she hurt her ankle recently. She blew out her a Achilles and she said the doctor immediately tried to prescribe oxycontin. She was like, got the fuck out of here. Yeah. She's like, I'm not taking that shit. No. And you know, um, it happens, man. Doctors just try to shove pills down your throat. It's a real common thing. And if you have any sort of serious injury and they put you on that stuff, one of the things they put Tom Penny on was fentanyl and fentanyl is that shit that's fucking killing. Everybody took meth. Meth are very similar.

Speaker 3:          00:40:31       No heroin. It's a extreme deal. Heroin. Yeah. It's an extremely potent opiate. Yeah. It's, it's much more, much more potent than heroin. I didn't many, many hundreds of times more potent. Yeah. And so they give these people fentanyl patches and then they're taken oxycontin's too. And who knows what else. I take it and I mean, I, I've, I feel terrible for someone who has bad pain, like, you know, from a broken hip or something like that. But Jesus Christ take the pain rather than death. Seriously, this shit you could take CBD, you can take CBD. It doesn't even have a psychoactive effect and as radical pain reducing properties to, yeah. Yeah. And I, and I, I,

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       I don't do drugs, but the fact that people are so actively prescribing these, these heavy, really heavy hard drugs to patients, people kill people and weed is still illegal. And I don't smoke weed, so I'm not even like for myself, but just for other people.

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       Well, that's crazy. We need to be a pain reliever. Really. I've heard a lot of people say no. A lot of people do say that. It's just maybe, I don't know. I just, I'm one of those people that you're in, if you're in pain, just be in pain. Just like, just, just, yes. Just relax, you know? I mean, I remember one time though, I got my knee operated on, I had an ACL reconstruction and they gave me one of those buttons in the hospital. You press it and you get more fun. And uh, it was when, uh, they, they had my leg on this motion machine. Right. So like right after surgery, they're trying to get your blood moving. And so there's a couple of screws in there and they'd taken my patella tendon and cut it and put it inside and drilled it all in place and everything. And then I'm sitting at, it's, this thing's just, it's this throbbing pain. And they gave me this little button. I'm like, clap, clap.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       But I'm like, I'm in the hospital. I'm not going to overdose. But uh, I remember thinking, wow, this could be really fucking dangerous if you had this in life. Like it was like a little button on your hip and you just press it and you get a dose of morphine. But it was a wonderful feeling. I've only done it once while I was in the hospital. I got it for that brief moment. I was like, wow, this is an amazing feeling. It feel like, like you're floating through a cloud of love and just flying through the air. Like, ah, I went from being in exacerbating pain too.

Speaker 2:          00:42:43       So how, how do you feel then we, so we got in this discussion, we're talking about CTE. So now like, okay, I think MMA is a terrible career path and people ask me all the time as a professional MMA fighter, two different, two different organizations or like a couple people. It's probably the right career path for majority of people. Probably not a great career path, but so, you know, how do you feel about it when you think that you, I mean you're obviously saying, and I'm on the fence, but you're saying I think a lot of these people aren't getting CTE clearly. How do you feel about, you know, being involved with it? Cause that's like in my future I could probably coach them MMA, but I struggle with it because it's like, well, should I really recommend this person? Do you have a mayor?

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       Should I not? Because are they gonna end up fucked up and not be able to take care of the kids are aware. I don't think you should ever recommend MMA to anybody. Okay, good. I usually don't, I don't think anybody should recommend it. But I think some people, it's their destiny. Yeah. There's a few people out there that they want to, oh look, I don't think you should recommend skydiving to anybody either though career to that. I mean my friend Andy stumped is a world record holder of squirrel flies. That's, that's this death. Did you ever read there was that book called uh, something chasing superman or do you remember talking about it was about people like him and how it almost always ends up very poorly because you need this bigger rush and this bigger rush and this bigger rush. I was telling him big wave surfers in the flying suit and all of this, I was talking about the psychology behind it and how like it ends up poorly very, very, very often because these people need bigger rushes and more challenges and the end up fucking themselves up. It only makes sense.

Speaker 3:          00:44:23       Yeah. I would never encourage anyone to do that. But for him, I mean he's a retired navy seal and this is just another level of psychotic

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       shit we can do to fill his time with. But he's got a bunch of sponsors and he actually makes a living doing that. I would never recommend that to anybody. I wouldn't recommend skiing. You know, my kids liked skiing. I don't even like skiing. I go skiing with them every time. I skied like, no, I've never gotten hurt. But I'm like, fuck that. Every time I'm skiing though, I'm like, don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Who wouldn't get hurt? Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Oh, I think it's Sonny Bono. Oh Geez. Who else? One of the Kennedy's in a tree. Right then maybe that was a, that could have been false flag. No one could have been right until we'll push them into the tree. Yeah. Fuck it took a ski out with a sniper rifle, but I wouldn't go too close to the woods.

Speaker 4:          00:45:11       Yeah. I think that there's a lot of very, very dangerous career and I think if you feel compelled to do that, no one should be talking you into that. But yeah, I don't think anybody should stop you. Like, I like the fact that boxing exists, you know, would never want to tell. You know the Civil Lowman Chanko don't fight. Sure. I don't know. I would never want to tell him don't fight. I want to see him fight. Well, what if they, what if, uh, it gets proven without a shadow of a doubt that these things cause he, he CTE. Do you think the government is going to ban them? No, I don't think they can really. How could they be? Are they going to ban the government? Like banning everything they really do. They like banning things that cost them money or the cost people who don't end up to them money.

Speaker 4:          00:45:54       Fair enough. The banning of the drugs is really tied to pharmaceutical drugs more than a year. They're not banning it because they're trying to save us. They're banning it because someone's putting pressure on them to ban it or had put it in the past and they're, nobody's banning a skateboarding. No one's trying to ban BMX ride. Those guys kept fucked up. I mean, I was watching this video the other day of those guys doing the ramp with the skateboard and the guy got to the top of the ramp and didn't catch it right and fell like a hundred feet awful. Oh Jesus Christ. I mean they get beat the foot that's up. That's another one where the damn book chasing soup man, or being superman mad at something. Nothing. Superman coding. Superman. I decoding superman was called the coding superman. Yeah. Okay. So like if you go back and watch the original x games when I, you know, I was a kid, I don't remember what year it is, nineties at some point.

Speaker 4:          00:46:40       And uh, oh, the rise of the Superman, decoding the science of ultimate human performance. This is a, this is a freaking fantastic book. I mean it's like, it's so awesome. I'm so, I'm obsessed with sports psych. Like I said, I'm sure Steven Kotler. Yeah, that guy's interesting. Yeah. But so if you look at like the original x game stuff and then you go to like the x games today. Oh yeah. It's different world. Yeah. Totally different events. So much more extreme because you there, it has to be this advanced, advanced, advanced, advanced, but then all of a sudden people are getting left up. Yeah. You get to a certain point where you can only do so many flips in the air with your bike. Apparently they tried to go more. I would do one rotation. Everybody go, this is crazy. Yeah. Somebody that comes along with two and then now they're doing three. Wasn't there? The movie about a Tony Hawk was like the first one did the seven 20 or something. But now they go way more, don't they? Yeah. It's and going to be more in every year. And if you watch any of those par core kids that are building to building and, and we've had one of them are in here. What was his name? James.

Speaker 5:          00:47:38       He's a

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       find it. I don't know. I'm sorry. That one I listen to mostly you're a political ones. I think some of the people you bring in are highly fascinating. Yeah. It's, it's an interesting time. W I get labeled outright. I know it's bizarre, but everybody's so quick to label people today. It's such a strange time. Finger pointing and putting people in boxes. Disingenuously it's, it's more divisive. They, a lot of these leftist, they want to, uh, you know, they want to say, well, I'm trying to make people less racist, but what they're really doing, they're being very divisive. Yeah. You know, and like I would, I think you identify as libertarian. I W I identify more as a libertarian than Republican or Democrat. But yeah, a lot of people say, I'm all right or love Trump so much and it's, well, I'm more libertarian than anything.

Speaker 4:          00:48:28       I think less government, less invasion into our lives. But people want to put you into a little box because you don't agree with what they're saying. Yeah. It's a weird time for that. And W I think what you were saying about shaming, they tried to shame you into this racist or shame, but you're not doing that if you're pretending someone's racist when you know they're not. Or if you're pretending that someone is a sexist or homophobic or whatever, when you know that you're just, people are, they're ignoring nuance. Yeah. And what, and what's, what they're really doing also is they're making, they're making people afraid to speak their minds. Right. And really how, if you and I had a disagreement on something, how we would come to a common ground is by discussing it. I'd say, well, I think your result person, what do you believe?

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       Then you'd say, well, I don't agree with that and this is why. And eventually we would talk it out and maybe we still disagree, but we'd come to a common ground. Right? But instead the people on the one side, they're not saying that they're saying, what'd you say you're racist or sexist or homophobic, nay, nay. Name one. Right. And then ended discussion. Then there's no discussion at all. Right? Yeah. They're trying to win. Yeah, exactly. They just turned on when they're trying to label you and then get the upper hand. And yeah, I think there's a real problem with people not being reasonable. And I think that you should be able to have conversations like I've had, people have criticized me, uh, even in person I've taught, like why would you have that guy on your show? Which one? Any guy like a Milo Yiannopoulos, perfect example.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       And I'm like, well look what happened. I mean, we got to see how the guy thinks God got mean all, all of his weird issues that came up and his book deal falling apart. A lot of that had to do with conversations I had with him. Yeah. It's like now you get to chance to see how the guy actually thinks. And I don't think there's anything wrong with the way he thinks. I think it's a, he's a provocateur. I mean it's not how I think. Yeah. But I think that everybody has this perspective on who he is that is exaggerated because of this public persona that he does that to be outrageous. So I think that's a double edged sword because I think, I think Alex Jones does it as well. Alex, where way crazier than well, but okay. But same idea, right? Is like, yes, part of their persona is a show is a show.

Speaker 4:          00:50:34       It's making it more extreme because they want to say that one thing that's totally effing crazy. It'll catch a headline somewhere. Right. And so they have these beliefs, but then they kind of go beyond them because it is a show and because they will make more money if they get more followers or more people clicking on the articles. Are there videos or whatever. So I think it is, but then you know, you go to someone like the Bret Weinstein Guy, I think he's fascinating. People calling him a racist and you know, he was strong liberal and he's as progressive as it gets. He's as far from a racist as you could ever get. Yeah, yeah. There's a, there's this need to label people. Well Alex is, Alex is a showman and but also like he says, some things that are pretty fucked up, like the sandy hook stuff, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:51:19       The Sandy Hook was a us. He's looking for conspiracies everywhere. Everywhere. He finds them some places. So sometimes he's, right. Exactly. Sometimes he's right. Yeah. But the problem with looking for conspiracies everywhere as you are going to, you're going to make people feel terrible. Yes. There was an article that I read about a guy who was a conspiracy theorist until his son was killed in Sandy Hook was people were telling him that his son wasn't killed and that is some sort of a government actor and this guy was devastated. Yeah. You know, of course the people that are really the nutty conspiracy theorist, Oh, you're spoken undercover still. You're still under Grover. There's people out there that look for conspiracies. Yeah. Everything. And it becomes a real problem because it muddies up the water. But I think, I think at the same time, you, at least for me, and I think we have similar thought processes, you can't just take what mainstream media tells you and say, well, I guess that's how it happened.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       Right. So as an in some situations, but in Sandy Hook, you have dead kids of people grieving. You have bodies, autopsy reports. Yeah. It happened. Yeah, absolutely. I know had guns. You had a mentally ill person who had access to these guns. Then if you take that same thought process on say, Stephen Paddock in the Las Vegas shooting, well we still don't know how that turned out, right? The Las Vegas shooting is complicated, but as we know, one guy did do that well now coming out with new stuff, I think there was other people involved and he might've gotten help from people, whether it's willingly or unwillingly, but or wittingly or unwittingly. But I don't think there was other people shooting. They've said that. So I don't know. Right. And that's what the law of these conspiracies, you'd have to understand that you're never really gonna know what the real truth.

Speaker 4:          00:53:00       Right? Right. You have to keep it open mind and you'll say, okay, well this person says this. What does this person say? What does this person say? Do these things, check out with each other. And it's like how many different times have they changed the Las Vegas shootings timeline? Right. And then it was kind of weird that it went way out of mainstream media. Like I'll send you heard about it for a week and then you didn't hear about it again. Sign of the times, I think the new cycle. Today's about Tony Hours. Yeah. But you would think people want answers. I mean

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       that's the largest mass shooting in United States history. I think we'd want some more clear answers on what really happened and how it happened and why it happened. Um, and we never really got those. And I know there's been a few new articles on it recently and so maybe we're going to find out more information, but it's an incredibly confusing story. Absolutely. The guy was clearly a psycho and clearly fucked up. I'm clearly planned this out for a long time. I mean he, he got hotel rooms overlooking music festivals and other places. Yeah. And like was planning out how to do this for a long time. He had a note in his, uh, in his hotel room that had all the ballistics calculation, so he knew like, like bullet drop from x amount of yards and he was calculating how to kill all these people. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       He was on some weird antidepressants and anti not anti anxiety medication, which does all kinds of weird shit to your head. There's a guy that was prone to fits of rage. He was a, a calculated professional gambler. There's a lot of weird stuff with this guy. The fact that he accumulated these weapons over years. Yeah, and maybe did it knowing that he was going to do this so you don't, there's a, whenever there's a mass shooting or anything, that's crazy. You have two things happen. One, everybody wants answers and to everybody forgets about it really quick because some new shit happens in the news and if it wasn't your family that got shot, it wasn't someone that you're close to that got shot. I know people that got shot there. I know people that I met them. I met people in Vegas that that got shot there.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       I talked to them after it was over. It was complete and total chaos and when there's complete and total chaos, you get all sorts of conflicting reports. People were running into other casinos saying that there's a shooter because they ran out of that area and so then people were calling and police reports. There's a shooter in the Monte Carlo, there's a shooter in this. And so those things get reported as fact when many times it's a part of the confusion of a chaotic mass shooting. Like that Vegas event. I don't know what happened other than the fact that this one guy definitely killed a bunch of people, but whether or not someone was helping him or whether or not there was other people involved or I think they're still investigating as to, yeah, and it's, but, so I guess my, my greater point there would be that, uh, if you're an intelligent individual, you can't just take what cvs tells you to be complete fact, right?

Speaker 3:          00:55:44       You, you go do some investigation yourself, you try to read from different sources and then, Hey, sandy hook, I think there's like a 99.999999999% chance of Sandy Hook was real. Right. Is there some crazy in the impetus of the small chance that didn't happen? Sure. Right. But I think, I don't think there is, I think it's very unlikely. And this a Vegas was a 0% zero. Sandy, Sandy Hook didn't happen. So I looked into it pretty, you know, it's just sad to me. And you're a dad, you know the idea of your kid going to school and getting their school getting shot up by some psychopath. Yeah. Imagine if someone was saying that that was fake. Yeah. After your kid's dead, you'd be frustrated, infuriated, you wouldn't even know where to turn. And these that's actually happening to these people and they're, they're getting labeled as, as frauds and people are emailing them and saying, how could you do this? You're, you're defrauding the American people. You're a part of the Illuminati or,

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       yeah. So, well, I think so. I think there's obviously those people who are on, right. The way one side of it, there's so there's, so if you go a spectrum for me, right? There's the American who's drinking diet coke and eating frozen pizza and listening to every CPS says, right? And then in the total opposite of spectrum, there's the group that thinks every single thing that ever happens in America as a, as a planned conspiracy by the new world order. Right? So those are two ends of the spectrum right now. We can fall anywhere in the middle there. But I, so I think as an intelligent individual, we look at situations independently and say, well, there's some sketchy things. They're not sketchy things there. That's probably true. Right. And kind of independently think about stuff by ourselves and that's, that's how I do it. And so, you know, that's a wise way to approach it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:57:20       And uh, I think CBS or NBC or you know, any name, your new source, they're run by people. And if they weren't there, they only have access to a certain amount of information. And sometimes they get bad information and sometimes they don't necessarily know. I don't know how much of it is a part of some grand conspiracy rather than how much of it is a part of the chaos of these moments. The lack of information and people drawing conclusions and, and then also witnesses on the scene and people on the scene of something that's crazy. They give all sorts of weird accounts and they're just, they're filled with adrenaline. They don't know how to handle the situation. People, you know, the people don't handle chaotic events very well.

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       Yeah. But I don't think the earth flat if that's fair. Well, good for you. Yeah. What do you, what do you possibly believe in? That might be crazy. Can I take a piss in it? I'll tell you. I got to go fast. Go ahead. No worries man. I wonder if there's something wrong with my bladder that you can hold it. Yeah. Do you think I've trained it? Yeah. I mean, sure. I just had guys going to try to shoot himself to see the flat earth and a couple of days. Oh, you guys shoot himself up into the space and don't take March 2nd James Kingston,

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       James Kingston. Thank you. Sorry James. Yeah. Bam. Yeah, it's a Dunbar. There is Dunbar's number, brother. Uh, you can only keep 150 people in your brain at any time. Look at that fucking picture. We're looking at a picture for the audio folks of James Kingston on the top of this tower. And I don't know how many fucking stories he's up there, but it's insane because below him, and I mean way below him are skyscrapers. That's probably like Dubai or something. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:58:56       Do you think that Dunbar's number could apply to other things besides people like websites or numbers of instructions? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:59:03       yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think so. You know, I think it, uh, it applies to too many things. Uh, it applies, I just think for names, names and people, I'm, I'm struggling. I think I'm getting like I have a overflowing pot, like, um, um, shame Burgos

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       and Calvin cater. We're fighting this weekend and I called Calvin Cater, Chris Cater after he won, even though I'm a fan of his, like he wanted, I went Chris Cater and then I'm like, it's fucking name's Calvin dumb cunt. Like I just don't, I think I'm running out of space in my head for names. So my apologies to Calvin cater. I'm running out of names and my, we're talking about Dunbar's number, how you can only keep so many people in your brain. My brain's overflowed. I don't have any hard drive space left. I didn't know. So I thought it was a is that the guy says you can only like keep track of 150 people like what's going on in the relationships and that kind of stuff. You only have so much room in your, in your hard drive space. Yeah. It's based on a tribal societies. Like our brains are sort of designed to keep track of 150 people.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       That's how we evolved and then over the last, you know, x amount of hundreds of years, now all of a sudden you have to keep track of many, many multiples of that. Especially if you're someone like you or I that runs into so many people who you, you, you meet on a regular basis. Got to keep those people all in your brain. But is it, is it, so I guess I haven't read that. Read it an edge. A bunch. Is it that you have to just know their names and faces, or is it that you have to know like what's going on in their life? I think you're supposed to be able to track them, like have a, some sort of a, whether it's intimate or personal relationship with these people know them. Yeah. So it's like there's only something like, especially if you think about a commentating on fights, I have to pay attention to these guys and what they're doing and their career.

Speaker 4:          01:00:51       And there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of 500 fighters now, 500 fighters that's active. And then how many of them get re new guys come in, old guy go away. I still keep them all in my head. Hey, what's Sean sherk up to these days? They're all still in the head and it's like, there's not, there's only so much room. And after a while you will, you'll wonder, you're like, wow, where are all these people going? Yeah. And I found that obviously with the, it's sad, like, you know, college friends, it's like, yeah, you know, and it's good because you see him and it's like no time has passed. Right. But it's like I, if I, if I know if I was live in two minutes way, we'd probably be best friends still. Right. But now I get to see you once a year, twice a year maybe. I can't keep up with you, dude.

Speaker 4:          01:01:31       It's super challenging. I totally agree. And you're now max and I run the rest of the academies. My brother, we have three in Wisconsin and it's like this fall was my first wife fulltime, worked at one and so now I'm really immersed in the one academy, whereas I was kind of loosely keeping track of all three. But now that I'm kind of totally immersed in the one, I find it a lot harder to keep track of what's going on at the other two, whereas kind of bed read it before when I wasn't so immersed in one. Yeah. I can only imagine Eddie Bravo is a hundred schools. That's crazy. Right? It's 110 plan. Jujitsu's worldwide. Like how he can't keep check all uncanny. I don't know. I don't know. I'd have to ask him. I know he travels to all of them. He travels, he's constantly traveling. I traveled all a travels constantly. He's doing seminars at all of, oh my gosh. Always traveling. Yeah. Once he is so easy to do like one time year for each facility.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       I don't know. It's a good question. That would be the Columbia he's going to, he's going, I mean you probably wouldn't even be once a year. Yeah. He's three years Singapore now. Yeah. He's everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       He was out in Singapore when I was there and uh, one of my fights this year, it was maybe the, maybe the May fight. Yeah, I think, yeah, he was out there doing is a 10th planet seminar and now that, and now they have a 10th planet program at evolve is crazy. Evolve is supposed to be an amazing facility. I've heard some amazing, yeah, it's Fab. I mean the, the nicest MMA facility I've ever been to. And so they have, they actually just opened their fourth location. Justin Singapore, which Singapore is a city state, right? It's 6 million people in a, on a really, really small island. But some of their, some of their academies are only a mile or two apart. Like they're not far apart, but the population density is such that, you know, they listen, they start classes at I think at 6:00 AM and they end class at 11:00 PM and you can freaking stop in anytime of day and there'll be a class there that's full with Muay Thai or Jujitsu, whatever you name it, it will be going on.

Speaker 4:          01:03:21       That's great. Yeah. Well Manhattan is kind of like that in a lot of ways, right? Manhattan is how many Jujitsu schools are in Manhattan? I mean obviously Marcel, yeah, there's hundreds, but really nick one's Hendel has got a huge one. Marcel has got a huge one, so yeah, there's a lot right there. Handles is huge. And that places enormous. Hundreds and hundreds of students. I thought that, no, I thought it was thousands. That's what somebody told me. Hanzo has over a thousand

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       students in the main New York City location. And I think it's, you know, it ain't cheap cause you got to pay for rent.

Speaker 4:          01:03:53       Mm. And so they're probably paying a couple hundred bucks a month. Yeah. Of still have of all right.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       Is I think $350 a month. Wow. But obviously, so Singapore is one of the most wealthy countries on the planet. So you have to take that new account approach. Everyone that lives there, it has a, a decent amount of wealth and you know, it, they spend it differently. Singapore is a fascinating country. If you, I, I, you know, I was there 15 times or whatever, so I got kind of immersed in the culture and then ended up reading the books about Lee Kuan Yew, the guy who started the country. And so, you know, there was a whole bunch of those Asian countries, they got independence in the 1950s and sixties. Um, and Singapore I blew was founded in 1965. It could be off by one year there maybe. Um, but you know, a lot of those countries are not doing super well economically and Singapore is like, this is freaking stand out country who's like top five world per person wealth and why, why, why are they doing so much better?

Speaker 1:          01:04:49       Uh, and so this is me from an outsider's perspective. So um, they really do a lot of kind of, it's kind of like self tracking, right? And so every month a Bungee, your check comes out to a, you know, like we would pay taxes, right? Bunch of mine comes another check, but so they can spend it. This is fascinating. They spend their money on three things. It goes, it goes in it, it's fun, right? Education, healthcare and housing. Okay. And so if you want cheaper, if any one of those, if you want the cheapest of it, right. It's very government subsidized and it comes out of your fund, right? So only a little bit of mine comes out. If you want the nicest healthcare or the nicest housing are nice, then it's only a tiny percent government subsidized. Right? So the more expensive the stuff gets, whether it's education or housing or healthcare, the less subsidize it gets in, the cheaper gets, the more subsidized it gets. And so everyone Kinda, you know, they pay, they painted this fun so everyone has this personal fund that they can use and then you know, into those three things. And so I think a lot of people have, I think they feel like they have more control over their lives and, and you know, obviously it is very strict regulations and laws, but from what I've seen and I've spent a lot of time there, everyone seems pretty happy. That's interest.

Speaker 3:          01:05:59       Yeah. That's an interesting way to go. I mean, I don't think there's any one good way to government to govern people. Yeah. And I mean I think we have a pretty good system over here, but it's obviously filled with bureaucratic bullshit and right. Too much weight, too much government. There's much, there's way too many people doing stupid jobs getting paid too much or doing them. And I mean it's, and then the shit like, you know, trying to chase down medical marijuana in 2017 trying to stop legal marijuana and like why? Like what, who's paying you to do this? Like why you, why are you doing that? That doesn't make any sense. It's not what our tax dollars should be going towards.

Speaker 1:          01:06:31       You know, it's funny when you go all the way back, I think about it. So we talk about that process of who's keeping them from doing this and you have like the pharmaceuticals with, with weed, which I think is true. You know what a funny one I think about is John Mccain and mixed martial arts who was sponsoring John Mccain, Budweiser who was like the main advertisers of her boxing. It's like you cannot make an argument that boxing safe for them and May, you can't freaking do it. So like it's impossible. It's impossible. But John Mccain's over here getting paid by Budweiser and saying MMA is awful. Let's ban it. And the same time he's promoting boxing, essentially it's fricking mindblowing. Well in his

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       fence. It was MMA from a long time ago and it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't really the same as them may now. And he's turned the corner and now he supports him. My man. Yeah. But also you've got Budweiser and bud light or sponsors now of MMA, so it's like, but that's a real problem with politicians. They're dirty. There's so many dirty politicians. I don't know what percentage is, but it's high 97. It's probably, it's probably a fucking high. Know what crazy shit that, what could crazy conspiracy do you believe in?

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       So the one that got me started really like independently think myself was nine 11, which I think that was, that was for a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. What, what do you think about nine 11. Oh, I know. I don't know all the answers, but I know the given explanation. I don't believe what, give an explanation. Uh, the one that came, what's the damn report that they wrote?

Speaker 3:          01:07:58       The NIST report? No, that wasn't what it was. Was it? Yeah, we'll, NIST is a, the one who did the report on, um, tower seven collapsing.

Speaker 1:          01:08:07       Now, what was the other report that came out with right away? Um, anyway, so I had my buddy that right by the airport and he played loose change for me and I said, you are out of your Gd Mind, like you are insane man. Right? And then I started thinking, well that doesn't, maybe, maybe, maybe I should think about it. You know, that it was an inside job. I'm not totally, I mean, I, so I think obviously the planes flew into the buildings for sure. If there's no doubt about that. But um, that maybe the, there was inklings inclinations that ha that was going to happen and that not enough was done to stop it.

Speaker 3:          01:08:43       I think, um, this is one, this is another thing where you have a gigantic tragedy and because of a gigantic tragedy, there's a lot of people that draw these conclusions based on witness a testimony and things that are happening. But I think you have to realize that any time there's some, some thing that happens, people start looking for all these different correlating factors, right? You start saying, well, hey look, you know, there was a, there's local tests that were being done. There was, they were looking out for, uh, planes that were potentially gonna fly into building. Like they knew this was going to happen in advance, but if you talk to anybody that is in intelligence, there's, they're dealing with that shit every day. Just one day something happens. There's always warnings about terrorist attacks. There's always warnings about things happen. And a lot of times they, these warnings get towards like the FBI stop that. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:09:36       wait, there was one, there was one in San Francisco, right? They had bombs and they stopped in the ledger, security, whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       And this has happened many times. Yeah. Now when, when it doesn't, when they don't catch it and it goes through, then people start thinking, oh, there was some sort of a conspiracy. They allow these planes to fly into buildings. The missile hit the Pentagon and

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       look, there was a video came out of that last week, but I, I might've been fake news, the Pentagon thing. There was a video of the Pentagon or something. He ended up Pentagon, which looks like a missile and not an airplane, but I don't believe it was, you know, I was like this instincts, I've never seen this video before and obviously there's no video evidence of what hit the Pentagon.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       There's a video of something. I know there was one, yeah, the camera thing or a security camera video that was released, but what they did have is all sorts of pizza pieces of aircraft all over the fucking lawn in a blown up building and a plane that's missing and all the people dead. Like, I'm going to guess it was a plane. Yeah. You know, I just, I think people look for conspiracies and everything cause it's exciting.

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       Well, I mean stimulating about it. There is, but then obviously be, I, I know that you don't believe that everything we're told is the truth right away. Right? I mean if we go to something like a Gulf of Tonkin incident, right? I mean, perfect. That's been proven to be false. Or the fact like the banana republics, right? Where Dole asked us to go take out one of their dictators because they were going to nationalize all of the banana plants and that country. Yeah. I mean those things have been now proven to be totally factual that the United States government went and did that stuff. So the fact that, and you know, in 1960s or seventies those things were reported the opposite, right. We can't obviously take

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       everything that we've been reported as truth. While there's definitely been conspiracies that have been put together and executed and these conspiracies have greatly affected the American people. The Gulf of Tonkin is a perfect example. Another one that they were planning on was the operation Northwoods operation. Northwoods was one that they were planning on blowing up a drone jetliner blaming it on the Cubans that were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay. And they were gonna sacrifice American troops and American lives and they were going to do this in order to get people to be excited about a war with Cuba. Yes. Was, this is a real thing that was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was released by the freedom of Information Act and it was vetoed by Kennedy. So we know that there were people, at least in 1962 they were planning on shit like this. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       So that's a real thing. And the idea that that just went away and no one does that anymore. It's crazy. I don't, I don't believe that. I think there's, there's most certainly evil people in all fucking sectors of life. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So it's good to have an open mind, but there's also a lot of fucking conspiracy loons it looks they get consumed good. That's, that's the issue they get consumed with. Nothing that I've been told is true, which is obviously I said that one far end of the spectrum and I, anyone who is dead end is crazy also. Yeah. There's people out there that think the satellites are fake and they think that real and that the earth is flat is once. Why I just shake my head like the moon landing one's my favorite. I got balls deep in that for years I was complete complicit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       You think they did not go to the moon? No, I don't. I don't think that anymore. But you know what I think now I think, I don't know. But I do think that it is one of the more fascinating conspiracies that between 1969 in 1972 they had seven, seven, seven to attempt six of them successful. But they went to the Apollo 13 was the one that they didn't apparently make it and they had to come back. But that was the only time in history that a human being has been more than 400 miles above the earth's surface. All the space station missions, all the space shuttle missions, all that stuff is, is within Arbonne. Yeah, it's low. That's all very low. They went 260,000 miles out and back into deep space, but they'd never even flown a chicken out there and see if it can live.

Speaker 3:          01:13:28       Like we really, really? Yeah. No, I'm not into this. The space travel and so, and they did a couple of flybys went around the moon. Oh, early before they landed on the moon. Yeah. But other than that, I mean without unmanned drones, like what we have on Mars and things like that, we've never really sent a living thing out through the magneto sphere, through the van Allen radiation belts into deep space, have it, you know, I mean there's all these possibilities of solar flares and anything that would have killed him instantly and they just did that and then we haven't been able to do that since 1972 that's the one way I, I've never looked into that moonlighting. I think it's kind of Goofy, right? Well it's, it's weird. It's a weird one. Why have we never gone back? It's been fifth. Surely our technology is far superior to what it was in 1969 right?

Speaker 3:          01:14:09       The technology is far superior except that they're not using that technology for man space, travel into deep space like that and then go to the moon. So it's like our technology and all these other areas is superior, but they haven't really worked towards that because they haven't been funded. So the big issue is in many ways it's money, right? There's how much money is there and going to the moon, and it's also very risky to send humans out there. Maybe we're talking about manned missions to Mars now, which may or may not take place by 2030 they're talking about doing that, but it's way cheaper and safer to send robots out there. Like why risk human lives. It's very retro the moon. Right, and if it robots on Mars. Yeah, the rovers, rovers on Mars or most the, that's the most interesting because they're, they're sending these really high resolution photos of the surface of Mars and they're running tests and checking for biological life.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       It's really, really interesting stuff. But between 69 and 72 when they did all this stuff, I mean there's, the technology back then was nothing compared to what they have now in terms of calculations and computers and, and it's also, there was a, there's unquestionably some stuff that, whether it was images or video that was faked and I think really, yeah, I do. Like I said, I never looked into this at all. Gemini 15 is the big one because there's a photo of Michael Collins. It shows him in deep space and they use it as a press release saying that he was on a space walk when it was really an image of him from a test run where there was all this stuff in the background and he was on his harness and they just blacked out the background and tried to sell it as him being in space save.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       You find that my Michael Collins, you, I was looking at how much it cost to send somebody to space though. It's insane. 79 70 million for ash and [inaudible] not to fly on a Russian shuttle. Those private guy's trying to sell tickets to places that mean days. I'll just try and do it Musk obviously. But that space, that's just, that's just low earth orbit. That's, that's still inside 400 miles or trying to go anywhere? No. Well they might in the future. Branson. Well that's all same thing. It's all the way through but, but, but they are talking about future visits to the moon and to Mars. But a lot of times I feel like when they say that, you know, George Bush senior said that they were going to go to the mute back to the moon again and like fucking one was that 1990 or whenever the hell that was. But people have always said, we're going to go back to the moon, but we haven't been back since 1972 does that mean that we never went?

Speaker 3:          01:16:43       No. But Dennis gets weird when you find out that Wernher von Braun was a fucking Nazi. Who? Wernher von Braun, the guy who he was the head of NASA. He was the guy who organized the the moon landings and though he was the head rocket guy, he was, he, that guy was a legit Nazi like he's wanted by the, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that he was alive today. They would prosecute him for crimes against humanity. They would hang the five slowest workers every day in front of his Berlin rocket factory. Oh yeah. No, 100% I mean, that's what they did. What they did was they took this thing was called operation paperclip, where when we won World War II, they took all the top Nazi scientists and they secretly brought him over to America and they did it on the down low so that no one would think like, hey, why do we have a guy named Wernher von Braun running the American space program was because the, the Nazi scientists were insanely advanced.

Speaker 3:          01:17:42       Hmm. So the question is like, well, were they really Nazis or were they scientists that were under the boot of the Nazi administration? I mean, well, I don't know. I mean, I'm not around that, but I do know that these are the people that were the head engineers and the people that designed it, Wernher von Braun's himself was saying how impossible it was just years before they did the moon landing and years before operation paperclip that it was impossible to go to the moon or how ridiculously impossible would be. But technology advanced from then to when 1969 happened to when they did it. I stopped saying that we never went to the moon because I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. And that's, that's a big part of the understanding. These conspiracies is hard. You have to, well you have to really know how much do I know about rocketry? How much do I know about aerospace? Zero. Yeah. So if I'm running around saying I don't, I, you know, I don't believe people went to the moon. What is it based on? It's based on mostly on ignorance, speculation and the exciting excited feeling that comes with trying to uncover a conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       Sure. But a, and I think you do have to be a little bit discerning on what you hear and, and, but it is frustrating and that's where a lot of these conspiracy guys, they think they know more than they do because you have to come to the realization that you're probably never going to know the real answer with a lot of these things realize, I mean some of them come out many, many, many, many years later we're talking about like Gulf of Tonkin writer or operation Northwoods. Many years later it comes out, but you know, there's a good likelihood that I'll never know the truth on stuff. I had read a lot about,

Speaker 3:          01:19:13       I think with the moon landing, it's way more likely that we went to the moon, but that some of the footage is fake and I think they probably did that because it's incredibly difficult to film things on the moon. And I think they filmed some stuff in test runs and then tried to pass that stuff that I iPhone, they didn't have it back then. They had these cameras that they had in the center of their chest. I think they were been taking a Selfie on the moon. They had the snapchat, snapchat, you'd have to take your shoot off then you would die. There was theirs. Yeah. They didn't have a camera that you could put in front of you.

Speaker 1:          01:19:43       Well, maybe they have one of the clicker buttons they could have with their big gloves on and they, they, you know, they put the thing out and then click it and then boom, snapchat. Why fight in the moment?

Speaker 3:          01:19:50       Well that's what they said. Well, it was that they did it remotely. That's how they captured the video of the lunar module, leaving the surface of the moon and panned up and watched it go that they did all that remotely. Hmm. It's all this some squirrely footage ever. See the video of them jumping around and it like, they're on trampoline and I see that we like, they're just bouncing straight up in the air and you're like, well, what the fuck is that? How come the physics are different in different flights? Like in some, some of the flights like Apollo 11 they're barely getting off the ground. They're walking, but they're kind of to do. Yeah. Like that. Well, there's ones like that and then there's, we'll also ones where they fall down. It looks like the getting yanked up by wires. Hmm. I think it's entirely possible that some of that stuff was fake.

Speaker 3:          01:20:33       Huh. But I don't, I think it's way more likely that they actually went to the moon than they didn't. But it's way sexier to think that they faked the whole thing. It's fun. It's fun to think they faked the whole thing and everybody was quiet about it. And you know, Neil Armstrong gave this real cryptic speech on the 25th anniversary of the Moon mission saying that, you know, there are hidden truths, uh, the, the, the, that, uh, what is, what is the exact quote that he said? Um, some of the great truths that could be real revealed, removing some of truths, hidden layers, like he was giving her away. It was real cryptic. It was like, what do you see if he could find it? I got the video, the play, the video. He might have been given it away. Well, it seemed if you were conspiracy theory, this would give you a rock hard boner cause lesson. Listen to this.

Speaker 6:          01:21:24       Armstrong, middle rare public appearance. Next generation of taxpayers.

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       No, no, no. Just play the whole thing so you don't confuse everybody. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:21:31       In 1994, Neil Armstrong meter rare public appearance and held back tears as he spoke these brief cryptic remarks before the next generation of tax payers as they toured the White House.

Speaker 7:          01:21:44       Today we have with us, my group of the students, some on America's best to you. We say we have only completed a beginning. We leave you much. That is undone. There are great ideas. Undiscovered breakthroughs are available to those who can remove one of truths, protective layers.

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       What the fuck does that mean? I mean, what do you supposed to say Yo, I went to the moon bitch. Yeah, that's what's to say breakthroughs. He's giving it away. Truth, protective layers like I don't even understand what that means. The vig caught the press conferences. One of the more fascinating things, if you watch the press conference again, I was balls deep in this stuff for years. The press conference from 1969 when they were returned from the moon is one of the most cryptic weird things you'll ever see. These guys look like they just stole something and they're being questioned. It's, it's, it's, I've never seen a video where people look like they're more full of shit. Then that video of the press conference from 1969 it's weird, man. It's weird. They're like fidgety and looking nervous, like they getting away with something and then they might have done it right.

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       They might have a been forced to say some things that they didn't want to say and that could be part of it. Yeah, absolutely. You know, they could have done it, but there's a lot of weirdness with the moon landing. It's, it's, if you wanted to have like a conspiracy that to wrap your head around, it's exciting. It's one of the best ones who benefit, who benefits from it? The United States government did because it showed military superiority over the Russians and we were able to do that. It also, you know, it was the Nixon administration people would just flat out full of Shit. Well I mean they were just lying to people left and right back then. The government though. Yeah, but even more so than cause it was unchecked. There was no media, there's nothing that would expose them for this and this stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:23:48       They would air it on TV once in 1969 you never see it again unless you watched it on film. There was no youtube. We can go back and watch the astronauts on trampolines video. That's my favorite one. You watch that and you'll, what in the fuck is happening there? These guys are bouncing up in the air like how are they doing that? Like they never did watch Apollo 11 when they were moving around on the surface of the moon. It just like they're moving in slow motion and then you go to whatever it was like Apollo 14 or 15 when they were doing the trampoline thing. They fucking flying through the air. Have you seen it?

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       I've not. I know I had never gotten to the moon thing. The flatter watching is ridiculous. This

Speaker 3:          01:24:26       and like their feet are hidden. Look at this, watch these guys bounce up in the air. It's like they're on some sort of wireless being yanked up into the air. Oh yeah. Like what the fuck are they doing? And they're playing like falling down and it's very weird. But it could have been that they were really on the moon and these guys were fucking cowboys and Yahoos and they wanted to bounce around. Oh, you're a pussy. You're posting those videos. Posted those videos back in the day. Yeah. I had a debate on Penn Jillette's radio show with uh, a guy who was an astronomer and he wasn't willing to admit a lot of stuff. That was a fact, like the fact that Wernher von Braun was a Nazi, the flag looks I was still there. Well the flag out of wire, first of all on the top of it that stiffened it up to make it, but there was, there's videos of the flag moving in a nonexistent breeze, which is weird too.

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       And yes, they try to make some logical explanations for why the flag could be moving in a vacuum and some of it makes sense, but some of it doesn't like the, the wires. One is weird. If you watched them fall down, like go to that one right there, Jamie. You like if you watch, like sometimes they're falling down and when they're falling down it looks like they get yanked back up. But I think it might not have been real footage. What they might've done is use some test footage like right there at Jamie right there. Let it go. Like homeboy falls down and then it looks like he is yanked back up. Look at this.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       Oh, he did not that him standing up. Yeah. What is this? That's not even standing up. You can't stand up like that. Right, but you're on the moon. You realize you're on one six earth's gravity, but there was no, there was nothing to make him go like this. Right. You can't get

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       up put. Exactly. Now we go back to MMA because that's what these freaking folkstyle wrestling is. The next generation of MMA, you turn to your base to get up. You can't look at it. There's nothing on the ground. How's he going to get the momentum of the yanked up? He would have super abs. He would have to be like a break dancer because, okay, maybe a break dancer, maybe a break dancer, but you can't get up without putting a base down. Right. Yeah. That was really weird. I never, I never saw hard watch it again. Watch him get yanked up. Yeah. He's got no base pieces played in reverse. Almost does it almost does that. He couldn't stand up like that. But the thing falls down right afterwards so it wasn't reversed. I think it's entirely possible that some of the footage was bullshit, but it doesn't mean that they didn't go to the moon.

Speaker 4:          01:26:49       It means it overzealous people in. He only has one sweat on the ground there too. Right? Yeah. Well that's true. Look at this watch. So he stood up like that's ridiculous. You can't do it. What is right? Floods down. His left, what's up and he just goes straight up the air. That's fake. But I've never been in one six earth's gravity and neither of you fake dude that that says we never went to the moon. I saw that video is fake. Not to put the video is real. That's from television. The video that guy standing up like that he got helps on that. Can't stand up like that very well. He could have been on wires. It could have been that they were using that to simulate what it would be like. Cause they definitely filmed a lot of simulations. They get a lot of that because they wanted to prepare the astronauts.

Speaker 4:          01:27:35       It's entirely possible that some of those simulations gotten passed off as being an actual video of them on the moon. Sure. Yeah, fair enough. Or the fake, the whole fucking thing. I wasn't there, so I'm pretty used to it as a privilege. I think folkstyle wrestling is the next, that's the next genesis of MMA, right? We go, what's next? Like that guy standing up. People don't realize it. If you watched the Lima Roy Fight, it was, it was incredibly frustrating to watch for me, uh, because Lima was literally just laying on his back and guard and guard is almost nonexistent effective in MMA now. Unless you're Brian or Tayga. Okay. There's, there's a few guys, tiny amount, but I think those, but those guys are like, you, like your wrestling is so highly effective and MMA. Some people could say you can't get by just with Breslin.

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       Well, well, hey, I don't just wrestle. I'm a black belt. In Jujitsu you use on a lot of wrestling. Yeah, primarily. Yeah. I mean it's not that Brian Ortega can box too. You can do a lot of other things to strike. I mean, he's a good solid striker, but his guard is so dangerous. It's just another level of dangerous as opposed to most MMA fighters, including Lima. Yeah. And so, uh, you know, people actually going back to their base, right? Which has been, it's been a no, no, forever. And it may, you don't go back to your base because you expose your back. Right. But then again, you know, what percentage of guys who are sitting in guard actually get submissions from the guard? No, the number's really small. Really? Well. So you're going to have to out now.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       Okay. Like this. So it's so fresh. And so in the, in the, in the Lima fight, Roy wins the first two rounds. It's competitive, but he wins pretty clearly. But the leg kicks her state. I had never been kicked as hard by anyone's Douglas Lema. He kicked me one time in the leg. I freaking it and walk right for a week. Really? Oh my God. He kicks so hard. He kicks so hard, so hard. And so, um, third round there's this accumulation of leg kicks and all sudden Roy's leg is really EFT. Up from getting kicked a handful of times. Right. And he's doing that low calf. Yes. Chicken, I'm kind of all over. But the EEC Roy, Roy start are tending to do this one and you know, instead of checking it, so Lima starts taking control of the fight. The, I think he wins the third round in my opinion.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Fourth Round in the beginning he like kicks him once and Roy falls down and he hops in a mountain, starts beating him up. You're like, holy crap, this fight might be over. And then so Roy recovers, but then the fifth round, Roy goes out and shoots like a single leg, double leg. Like immediate. We're talking first 10 seconds. Right. And going into that writing to take shit. He might get finished this round. I mean he, he can barely walk, look at his leg. Right. And so they make us take it down 10 seconds into the round. He literally stayed in guard for four minutes, 50 seconds. And you're like, at some point is he going to try to get up? Cause he has to, if he gets up in the lands weren't too more kicks it out, getting taken down the fights likely over. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       You know, but he refuses to turn to his base because this is anti Jujitsu. You shouldn't turn to your base in Jujitsu cause you're getting choked. Yeah. Fuck it Joe. At that point you're losing. Right. What else are you going to do? Well, he never made to sweep him. He never did try to submit them on the fact butterfly sweeping a couple of times. But so at this point, I mean even if I thought it was two, two rounds, two rounds, right, right. He was in the fifth round. He's got to try to get up at some point. So that was the did it for Rory. So he won. He won 49 46 on two scorecards in 48 47 on one. So what it was three to one. So then even more, right. Even more reason to get up at right. If you're losing by that much.

Speaker 1:          01:30:58       Um, but yeah, Lima refused to get up. So at that point I'm think, well, hey, maybe Lima thinks he won or something. I Dunno. But yeah, so a lot did you do to, people are struggling with this fact that in modern day MMA you're going to have to try to get up because God is no longer that affective and you just get punched in the face over and over and over again. And that's terrible. What are your feelings on going to half guard and like going for an underwriter? Same side. And yeah, try it, but it's not, you know, again, like as me as a, as a top guy, I would rather be in half guard than full guard. I'm going to land a lot of damage from half guard. And then you're also, if you're in half guard, you're me trying to work in your ESL tired and you're very unlikely to sweep me. Right. So I think half guard is better than full guard. But I think, I think eventually where people are going to have to get to is they're going to have to actually get up. You're gonna have to get up and putting your feet on someone's hips and kicking them is no longer a great solution. It works every once in a while, but it's not like you can do that every single time. It just does. It's pretty rare. Pretty rare. So he rarely, everybody's so aware of it. Yeah. So bottom bottom and folk style wrestling

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       I think is the next genesis and MMA where people are really going to have to have a deep understanding because once you do get taken down or once you get a takedown, um, and there's some, you know, Yoel Romero was the perfect example and he never did folkstyle wrestling and American, right. He's a very, very elite freestyle wrestler, but he gets these takedowns and you can only stay on top for like 15 seconds. Right. It's like you did all that work to get the guy on the ground and they use let them back up. Like what was the point? Right. What was the point of it?

Speaker 3:          01:32:27       Well, he's, he smashes some guys in the ground like Machida when he got him down on the ground and some of them, yeah, put them away. He's um, he's a freak athlete too. It's hard to say, Hey, do what he does because it's like no one's built like that guy. That guy's the weird, he has the weirdest body I've ever seen. Really? Why? Because he looks like he's 230 pounds and he weighs one 85 when he weighs in. It's like how the fuck is that one 85 I always look at him, I'm like, I don't even understand it. Like where's the weight

Speaker 2:          01:32:54       going? And you would think he's, well those guys did some PD is by looking at them but then when you look at him like he won a world title in 98 99 somewhere in there. He looks the same. It was the same at age 18 or 19 that's four test out yet. What's it crazy? You know, it's incredible because then you think like, well if he is on pds it had to be prior to age 18 cause he looks the same.

Speaker 3:          01:33:17       Well, what are your thoughts on like Karolin cause you know the carets yeah, but they used to call him to experiment. Yeah. And his parents are tiny. You know, his parents are like five, five, five, seven and then he's six foot whatever the fuck he is a guru of a man. Yeah. And I always wondered like one day in the future, whether it's five years from now or 30 years from now, they're going to be genetically manipulated people.

Speaker 2:          01:33:42       You're right, he watched ICARUS. Yeah, sure. Yeah. And that was fascinating. And that pretty much just, I mean cemented the Russian, that anti-doping program or they run every single person, state sponsored doping program where everybody forever. Yeah. For everybody. Yeah. It's crazy. And it's like you had the hint that they were likely cheating, you know, but then as someone who competed against them, man, that's a tough pill to swallow because they wouldn't make you feel, I mean, now it's like, well shit, I guess I should it be one way or the other. But to know that you are a leg down and like going into MMA now I it MMA I do, everyone was cheating for sure. Right. So I'm going to fight them whether they're cheating or not. I like to pride days. It was essentially sanction that was sanctioned. Like they would tell him like, hey, you know, when this contract that says you can do steroids.

Speaker 2:          01:34:28       Right. And how does one IFC handle that? Uh, so they don't, they don't do drug testing yet? Well, yeah, I mean I should be fine. I've been pushing them to do so, uh, you know, in my time there and their, their thing is that, um, a lot of these countries, it's not prevalent in Indonesia or Manila or wherever. And so I'll just skip to find out, just get the fuck out of here with that. That's my, that's not my style. That's what he's saying that it's almost Joe Rogan saying that. Get the fuck out. So there, but there, I know you've saw, you've, you've talked a couple times,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       I've heard you about their way and program and one of which I think is fantastic and I think every, every MMA organization should do it at the high level ones. Could you explain it? Yeah. So it's really simple. You do hydration and you do wait, oh ski on scale, same time. So you can't cut water out. Right, right. So to piss hydrated, get on the scale. Literally moments later, like you go in the bathroom, you pissed, they test the specific gravity you go get on the scale. Right? So essentially everyone moved up one way class. Every one of their champions bumped up a weight class. So like over there I fight one of the five. But you know, it's essentially wealth or they even call it welter weight because it's the same thing because I can't cut any waterway. They adjusted it. So they just, they moved every day.

Speaker 1:          01:35:37       So I was the welterweight champion and is still the way to welterweight champion. They just move. The weight class is different. Um, so there's the day of the fight. The day before the fight. Cheers for the fight. If you make the two days before the fight, if you make both the weight and the hydration, you do not have to wait test or hydration test on the last day, you're, you're clear. So if you make it both those days, cause you're not going to be, there's not going to fluctuate and for 24 hours and listen, if you can figure out how to cheat that, I can't figure out how someone could possibly cheat that test. Because when the first incident I said, well how is someone going to cheat on this? Or how could someone cheat? You know what it's like they look at, they watch a Piss, you know, you can't have like a wizard or on or anything.

Speaker 1:          01:36:14       Right. Uh, so I don't, I don't know how you achieve. I don't think you can. I don't think you can. I don't think you can. So yeah. So it's fantastic because like fight week then instead of making this, and so what I would fight one 70 I would be one 83 to one 85 to start my waterway cut out. Cut The waterway to one 70 or one 71, depending on title or non title, and then I would hydrate back up. So now I don't have to do that. That dehydration process, I'm literally the exact same size I was prior. And a, you know, media obligations during week are obviously a lot easier because I'm not worried about cutting my weight or I'm not feeling miserable or whatever. Um, and it's a lot safer. And then so if someone misses, so mrs obviously they're fine. The same as in America.

Speaker 1:          01:36:54       If you miss what you're fine. If you miss hydration, uh, so say Joe, you're wanting any five and you weighed in when a five, but you're dehydrated, you didn't really make it right. You have to get hydrated and make weight. So if you miss, wait, if you miss it, so it's the last day you haven't made it. You have to keep drinking until you piss hydrated. And then whatever you way there is what you weigh. So what's the parameters when it comes to hydration or not hardware? It's the, it's the same skill that you use for it. Uh, in America at the beginning of the college wrestling season or high school, you have to do specific or every test, I believe I might mess up a zero, but I think it's 1.0 to five is this specific area which I know is the same they use for hydrated, not hydrated in wrestling in America to anything under that you're dehydrated.

Speaker 1:          01:37:35       No, you're good. So you want to be bullet. So 1.0, zero, zero, zero is water. So you want to be close to that, right? And so there is like you do have to just, you have to drink some water, right? If you drink a whole bunch of water, you piss it out perfectly hydrated. But if you know, there have been a couple of times like so in the early days they did, they did tests. This is the first two days we're actually just testing to see where you were at. The third day was the one that counted. You know, it's like if you, if you ate a bunch of like meat or something, you might show up as dehydrated even though that's what you walk around. And every single day, so you'd have to make sure you drink a lot of water. So it's coming out nice and clear.

Speaker 3:          01:38:09       That's an interesting way of doing it. And I think that's a great idea because I think that is one of the biggest problems in MMA. The Uriah hall and Vitor Belfort got canceled last week. Uriah hall was like literally having seizures on his way to the way and crazy. Right. It's fucking insane. It does. And I think it's one of the worst parts of MMA because I think MMA shouldn't be about who's slickest in being able to deceive the weight system. I mean it should be your skill versus your opponent's skill. You both the same.

Speaker 1:          01:38:39       Well, the whole, the whole point of it is the whole point of the way it's to fight someone our same size. Yes. That's the whole point of it. Yes. And so why people would fight back against those system that one fc is using this beyond me because listen, the most miserable part of my weight cut. I'm fine dieting and that's all good. Right? But when you got to cut that last 12 1314 pounds of water weight out, it's miserable. Everybody knows is miserable. Right. And it affects your performance the next day. Yeah. I mean, so my, my thought process was it affects them more than it affects me. Maybe that's just me being positive about it. Right. That was, why is that? Because if you were wrestling pussy and I'm not right. Or maybe it's just me, my me psyching myself up. So my thought process on everything is anything that goes wrong will affect my opponent more than it will affect me. Oh, that's a good way. I am more stable. I can deal with shit that goes wrong. Most people affects them. And so maybe that's just me telling myself that, but that makes me feel good about it. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:39:31       people feel that way about awakening, the lightweight cutting because they think that the other is not gonna be able to handle it as well. Make them go through some adversity and then the next day he's gonna be

Speaker 1:          01:39:39       troubled. Sure. Exactly. So, but I think if you take that process away, I think it makes media obligations a lot easier. It makes people a lot healthier. And yeah, I mean, how many fights have you, just from a business standpoint, how many fights have we had canceled this year because of the weight thing? I mean, quite a few.

Speaker 3:          01:39:55       Did it change your performance? How physically, how do, how would you feel the neck?

Speaker 1:          01:39:58       I, I think I felt, you know, honestly for me, I know they said those studies that you don't really fully hydrate. I've, I believe it was 36 to 48 hours after man. I've always felt fine. And so I, so when I graduated college, um, the way class in the United States for, for the Olympics stuff was one 63 I would weigh roughly one 75 on a day to day basis and then water cut down to one 63. Um, and then when I was fighting at one 70, I would say between one eight three, one one eight, five and water cut down to one 70. So my water weight cut was very, very similar. Every single time. You know, I was disciplined in that manner. I want, I didn't want to be fluctuating. And so my goal is actually to get down to my target weight six weeks prior to competition, right?

Speaker 1:          01:40:40       So I'm walking around one, eight, three, two, one and e five, six weeks prior. So I'm the same exact person every single day. Whereas I think the part that a lot of these people f up, and it's because they're not disciplined enough, is they try to descend while they're training, right? So, you know, maybe I get up to one 95, which is, that's a small bump. Some of these guys are really undisciplined. They get way, way, way, way overweight, right? And so during that last six weeks, or even the last couple weeks, they're trying to bring that body weight down, right? And so in my mind, there's two ways to lose weight. You can dye it and lose body weight, right? Fat, mass, whatever. Um, and then there's the waterway where we're sweating and we're taking that out of us, right? There's the two ways. And so I think a lot of guys, and I, you know, I don't know if you've ever cut weight show, but I know.

Speaker 1:          01:41:21       So for me it was in college in the summers I'd get really fat and then I'd bring my weight down in the fall. And you feel it when you're not, when you're losing more calories than you're taking in. It's like this weird feeling in your body and you feel like shit all the time. And so I think a lot of fighters are doing that really close to when they're fighting. And so now the waterway cut makes you feel terrible and now they're cutting everything out. Calorically also and said that's like a double whammy. That's what I think about it.

Speaker 3:          01:41:47       There's another thing that benefits wrestlers and the wrestlers seem to take pride in being able to push through discomfort. Yes. And the more miserable you are, the more you just fucking bite down your mouthpiece and deal with it. Well, cause you, you get used to doing that all through camps, all through college and high school. You're always dehydrated. You're always losing weight.

Speaker 1:          01:42:08       Well, I mean the cod dressing that is not that the way cuttings not that bad anymore. So they had the system and people are starting to change a 97 I think couple died and a change it. But you know what? The name

Speaker 3:          01:42:19       institute the same thing as one of, see that's sort of a,

Speaker 1:          01:42:22       so it's once you do it in the beginning and find your minimum weight, but I think more than anything what people are, it's, it's a one our way in. So you, so if you're dual me does at one o'clock everybody weighs in at noon, right? So what people have found out, you can't cut, you can't cut weight. We wrestle like shit. So

Speaker 3:          01:42:37       problem with fighting doing that though

Speaker 1:          01:42:39       is brain injuries. So that's, I think once you the best. But in college wrestling, you're talking about the discomfort thing. Part of that is that, you know, when you go to a college wrestling program, again, it's very structured. You can't skip, right? You have to be there every single day. Right on time. And then it's like you have 40 boy, you know, black belt, right digit two black belts. Well, and not even just black belts like worldclass 19 to 23 in their physical prime ready to fight each other every single day. And so you get used to this grind dealing with people, battling people, discomfort every single day. Um, you know, and a lot of is also dealing with injuries like you know, and chill son and talks about it a lot that hey and I was talking to my casual is less. Listen, the national tournament for the NCA is March 15th through 17th and you cannot guarantee me you're going to be totally healthy on that date. You cannot guarantee meet your and be, uh, not sick on that date. You're going to have to compete March 15th through March 17th no matter what if you want to enrolled, you know, a national title. And so wrestlers get used to this grind where you just don't see that in other sports.

Speaker 3:          01:43:38       Yeah. I think that that aspect of wrestling is one of the biggest tools that they take into the octagon. The mental toughness and that, that ability to, I mean the grind, it's again, it's, it's a, it's a badge of in wrestling to be able to handle the grind. Yeah. It's not really in kickboxing or in Moitai or any others.

Speaker 1:          01:43:57       Well then not really forced to, I mean how many, how many kickboxing or, or Jujitsu schools you name where there's literally 40 black belt. I mean it's, it's been borne out through high school wrestling. You go to all these national tournaments and stay terms, you find out who the best are, the best of the best, get recruited and they go to these institutions to train with the other best of the best of the best, you know. And then, and then addition to that, the other, the post-collegiate guys who are trying to make the world teams and Olympic teams, they're sticking around training. So you have this like melting pot of freaking really great wrestlers. They're trained with each other every single day for five to plus five years. If you're going to world championships, right? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:44:33       yeah. There also seems to be like a much more systematic approach to training people and a lot more drilling, you know, and a lot of Jujitsu schools like gosh, should the arm bar from the guard here. We hooked the arm. Okay. I go on to here, my legs, I make my leg, I lift up. Okay. You practice, everybody get together. It drives me insane. It drives a few times. Like I'll go to Jujitsu classes sometimes and the literally go over to techniques. You drill it twice and then the last rest of the class is just people rolling.

Speaker 1:          01:45:02       Five minutes. Yeah, five, five minute goes. Maybe it drives me insane Joe, because I come from this wrestling background and then I also like sports psych in this study of high performance is like, that's what I love. I love, I love studying people who are the best in their field at whatever they do. And we know without a shadow of a doubt, just saying go for five minutes is not the most effective way to train someone does not happen. So in wrestling there's a whole bunch of different, you could do, some days you might do matches, some days you might do a 30 minute ago, some days you might do a group of three women, it goes, some days you might do situations. I started on the single leg, I started a high crotch, I sent a friend Doc. Right? And so there's all these different scenarios that we might try mean if I'm coaching my academy right and we're working on it, we, we drove front headlocks or we called Mantis position, we've grab both armpits and bounce and go for Joel on that.

Speaker 1:          01:45:47       We don't just say, okay now go five minute goes cause how many, how many tries are they going to get it going in the math, this position there are the front headlock, maybe one, maybe two. But essentially most people if you say go for five minutes, they, they are not disciplined enough to make themselves do new skills. They revert to whatever they do best and then he's doing over and over and over and over again. Right. And so if I want a kid to be good at a for a headlock, which if you're going to wrestle at a high level, you need a good for a headlock, period, factual, you have to have it. I'm going to put him in there 50 times in that practice. He's going to get it over and over and over and over and maybe the next day it's single likes and then maybe next day it's double legs, right?

Speaker 1:          01:46:22       And then maybe Sundays you say, Hey, go for 10 minutes, go wrestle. Right. Right. Cause you want to change it up on a little bit, but saying go for five minutes every single day is very much not the most effective way to do it. And it's so insanely frustrating for me to have that happen. And almost every Jujitsu school on the planet, Eddie Bravo is talked about this a lot. And one of the things that he says, uh, um, Jujitsu, so fun role that people just want to get to the rowing part real quick. I don't care what they want. It could be wrong. Like I freaking Care Gel.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       I want them and my kids tell me all kinds of stuff. I said I'm running practice. I went to the Olympics, I want to hunch trophies. You're at my school cause you want to learn how to be the best dominant help. You beat the best. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care what you like. I don't care what you like. Some days, every once in a while, hey you guys don't play game wireless play game right every once in a while just to keep it fun. Just to keep it fun. Right? Hey you want to do this? Let's do that. Every once in a while I'll indulge you. But most of the time you're here and so you know, we don't, for our, for our young, we don't really push our young kids too hard, but like especially, well I'll tell about high school guys. You're telling me you want to be a state champion.

Speaker 2:          01:47:26       You're telling me you want to go to college, you're telling me all of these things you wanted to, I know what it takes to get there. I've been there myself, I've seen many other people achieve those things. And so, you know, and there's a lot of, you know, it's really funny cause people choose and this even go Emma May, we can get life. People choose what they value. Right? And I'll just give you a simple example. I get this, I got this one kid who's probably listening to the show right now, cause I know he loves you. Uh, what's his name? Oh I can't, well I can't give one of my kids a shout out and not all of them. So, but he's probably kind of who you are. He's got to know who I'm talking about. He, he goes freaking hard. Just boom, grind, grind, grind.

Speaker 2:          01:47:58       Just I couldn't, I couldn't ask for a kid to work harder, Joe. But when I started teaching technique, he tunes me out and then we go to the national tournament and he places but he gets, he gets scored on a whole bunch by the technique. We were just drilling and then I say, hey bud, you just tuned me out the last three weeks. We were just drilling that thing and you just got your ass kicked by it. And so I love the fact that you want to go hard, but you need to also value the technique, right? Yeah. And then there's some people who value the technique too much and they all do. I do this technique and then when it comes to going hard, they don't go hard enough. Right. Because in wrestling or in any, in any venture you want to take in life, there's not just one way to be successful. You need a bunch of different attributes to be successful and so if you overvalue one or another and you devalue other things, you're not going to be as successful as you could. You might still be successful, but you're not going to reach the pinnacle because you're not putting yourself into the right situation.

Speaker 3:          01:48:50       It's funny because in a lot of ways it's like what you were talking about earlier, the two sides of the coin of a fighter being a wild person who doesn't care, the cowboy and then the other guy who's like super systematic, everything's controlled. Yeah. You almost have to have everything and the fighters that have those really strong attributes just have to be aware that those attributes are strengthened even further by technique.

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       Yeah. 100%. And, and, and again, it's both sides of the coin in me. Another one would be, uh, you know, something I called beginner's mind and then know it all right. And when you come into, when you come into practice, you need to have a beginner's mind. I mean, I got to work out with three or four time world champion Olympic Champ Jorn Pearl's last week. And he was asking me questions. It's like this guy really cared about learning from every possible source and he's already, he's already at the pinnacle and still trying to learn.

Speaker 3:          01:49:38       Interesting thing to Dominick. Cruz said, uh, during the broadcast about steep immuno chick that Steve Bay, when he went to alliance and the man was asking everybody,

Speaker 2:          01:49:46       you have to. Yeah. But then when you go into

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       a competition, you can't have the same mindset and thinking, I don't know, I need to ask. Right. And so like kids who, kids who have just the beginner's mind, they'll, they're great in practice but then they go into a mash and I coach, watch I do here, what should I do? What should you do? It's like, well just go wrestle, wrestle, you know. But then kids are coming to practice like I know it. All right, well that's a very unhealthy mindset also cause you when it's great, when you compete, it's great when you compete. So you got it. You've got to balance both those things, right? Like you can't have just one. Cause if you're, I know it all. I'm a bad ass. That's great for competition. But you come into practice, you're going to stop. You're learning right now when you're coaching kids, how much time, if any, do you spend on mindset?

Speaker 1:          01:50:29       Um, and so every, I added my Facebook every Monday, do this mental Monday, and then I usually repeat repeated or something fairly similar to the kids at practice. But I also think it's a lot, you know, I think competition is where you get your really, really good teachable moments because that's when kids care the most. And so like the kid I was talking about when he loses it because he didn't want to listen to me, I can say, well, look at, look at this. This is a great example. You know, I, I did this, I do private lessons with this fourth and fifth grader. They're brothers and, uh, and like five weeks in a row you're doing this wrong. You're doing this wrong. You're doing this wrong. You're doing this wrong. They don't want to listen. Right? Right. Then they do it. They have a match last week they do it wrong and it didn't cost him the match, but it almost cost them the match.

Speaker 1:          01:51:11       And, and now I can say every single time I see you're doing this wrong. Or I can say, remember that time in that match when you got put it in your back because you did it wrong and you refuse to listen to me. So I think that, uh, matches create great teachable moments. You know, like, Hey, you remember when you wilted under the pressure because you weren't tough enough? Well, you need to practice a little harder. So you get used to that pressure. Remember when the referee made a bad call and you flipped out because he made a bad call and they didn't think about, well, I still have to wrestle the rest of his match, right? So there could be all these, there's all these teachable moments within competition where you can say point to something very clearly and say, well, look at this and see how this affected you and see how you would have been more successful.

Speaker 1:          01:51:48       So I think from mental aspect that comes a lot more on one on one basis. And sometimes I'll use it in front of the whole team. I don't, I don't like, like really picking on people, uh, every once in a while I will. Um, but so I think the, I think there's competition provides a lot of teachable moments for athletes to see, well, am I stronger here? What do I need to work on? Because we, again, we can't, you can't say one mental aspect makes the guy successful. It's this conglomeration of many, many, many mental aspects that'll make you highly successful. Now when you're coaching, whether it's coaching wrestlers or MMA, final coach, movie theaters anymore. None. Zero. I how, okay. I help a couple buddies but I don't consider it and really just help us. Let's say, just say, when you're coaching restaurants, do you, do you concentrate it all on strength and conditioning or is it from the wrestling that you get most of your strength conditioning?

Speaker 1:          01:52:37       So we only got them, you know, an hour and a half, three or four times a week. And so we don't do a lot of strength conditioning. I know I read, especially with the older guys, I recommend they do some on their own. Um, you know, for a college program, for High School program where we're getting them Monday through Saturday, maybe twice a day possibly. Obviously we're in to do that, but you know, we're an academy, uh, you know, we're kind of on our own. We get them three or four times a week, so it just doesn't Trump what we need to do in that short time window.

Speaker 3:          01:53:04       How do you balance it out though? Like, how do you know how much strength and conditioning to do versus how much technique and skill work?

Speaker 1:          01:53:10       I mean at the college level are we talking about are because we do not, we do know strength conditioning and I recommend kids do on their own and you know, and if I had 12 hours a week with them, I would do that. But we, you know, we don't, we don't have that ability to, um, I think, I think it's important. I think it's really important. I don't think it tries. I don't think it trumps especially knowledge. And then if kids wrestle really hard against each other and kill HUD that one saying like wrestling is the best strength conditioning. I can't remember he said something, something, if you wrestle really hard against each other, you're going to develop those things. And it's like, I think like people went when I grabbed people are squeezed people, they're like, oh my God, I've never felt anything like it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:45       And I think that comes from that doesn't come. If you put me in a weight room, I can do nothing abnormal. I am not abnormally strong in any exercise. I'm actually like on a college division one costume, I'm significantly less strong than most people. Right. But then when they wrestle me and they're like, Holy Shit, I never felt anything like that. And I think it's because a lot of those things that I do are very, very, very wrestling specific. And I developed that strength because when I grabbed some impacts, like freaking grab him as hard as I can when I squeezed them, I squeeze him as hard as I can as an now from doing that thousands of times I've developed that squeezer that strength. Um, and so I think the strength conditioning is important, but I don't think it trumps doing other stuff. And if I had all the time in the world and these kids didn't have to go to high school or Middle School, I'd probably put them through some. But you know, we don't have that luxury.

Speaker 3:          01:54:27       What did you do when you were finding an MMA? How much did you devote to strength to get conditioning?

Speaker 1:          01:54:31       Twice a week, ish and maybe three sometimes. What kind of stuff? So I had a personal trainer since I moved to Milwaukee. I actually ended up, I actually, I helped him open up a crossfit gym. Um, and it wouldn't be that specifically crossfit workouts, but kind of that type of work. Nothing slow. We're, I'm doing three sets of 10 and two sets, a, you know, nothing slow like that potentially, you know, one, one or two days. We might do like a slower start and then, but you know, I think fighting, you need to be very highly active. You know, you need to be in really good shape and need bill to move a lot of things really fast. So kind of cross it type stuff I think is probably the right direction to go. And now when I go back to college programs besides like the heavyweights that in season stuff for college programs is mostly higher pay stuff, which I think is, you know, very relevant to both wrestling and fighting.

Speaker 3:          01:55:20       So did you do, when you were saying like you were doing like crossfit style workouts, so are you doing like kettle bells box jumps, like everything? So when I said that, I just meant that we, you know, we are moving at a high pace through a lot of stuff, you know, and it would be like, he would tell me, hey Diego, do some no. Do sled pushes. Do this. Do that. Do that though. What about like your diet and nutrition and supplements and things? Those have never

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       been, uh, that much into nutrition. I saw it. I said I don't. Okay. I was fat when I was a little kid. Right. K Too much at age 11. I said, I don't wanna be fat anymore. So I went from 130 pounds, 100 pounds in Tam, you lost 30 pounds and 11. Fifth grade, sixth grade, six one year. 100 pounds. That's a lot of weight. That's 30% of your body. Well, yeah, I was fat. I was fat as shit. Oh, you eating everything and you were wrestling into, yeah. Now you know, I was, I was having some success because when you're fat or there's not as many people to compete against, right. So anyway, so I lost 30 pounds, six grade. So I stopped drinking soda. I had this whole whole list of stuff. I just cut out discipline at 11. Yeah, I know. And that's uh, that's an, I want to look at kids.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       I think. I think the mental maturity is huge in, in longterm success. Being able to make, like, see, see the future and make decisions on what you want to do at that young age. So I lost 30 pounds and so now I have slowly started like reintroducing a lot of stuff by, it's like sodas gross. I haven't drank a soda and forever, you know what? They're growing fast food. I cut out fast food. I don't, I don't ever like, they haven't eaten fast food in 20 years. I mean, it's just disgusting, you know? And so like I eat generally healthy. My wife and I cook at home a lot. We make really healthy food. Um, and so, but I don't take any supplements. Zero, no multivitamin, nothing, nothing, nothing. So you get all your nutrients from your food. And I just figured like I, so I called, I tried a couple of supplements in college.

Speaker 1:          01:57:09       I never, I never felt anything from them. Like I didn't feel any different, you know. And so I'm like, Eh, I didn't feel anything. Why am I, why am I going to take that? I don't need to take it. And then so then obviously I became like this, uh, anti p e d crusader it, you know, by chance. And so then it's like, well now I really can't take anything because if I go take something and I pop hot because these idiots or putting something in supplement supplement should be there. I'm, it was like a total asshole. So I literally, I don't, I didn't even take protein. I met, took nothing. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. So did you make sure that you ate the proper amount of vegetables? Green leafy vegetables, eat some food and Latin script? I mean, you know, like it's like healthy food.

Speaker 1:          01:57:50       Like, we're eating salads and of course, you know, I'm not eating cake and ice cream and pizza and that kind of stuff, and we're eating healthy food at my house, you know, but I'm not measuring the grams of this or ground to that or so I really think, what am I? And I, this has been proven by science that you only have a certain amount of time every single day to have a high amount of mental focus on stuff. And so I think like my training is more important than focusing on nutrition and stuff. And so I want to really like really zoning in really high level focus when I'm training and stuff. And so I think if I worry about all this stuff, it'll take my focus away from that. Right, right or wrong. That's kind of how I thought about it. And it was a smart way to approach it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:29       And it never really affected me. I mean, uh, like I said, you know, even when I took the supplements in college, I never really felt them at all. So it's like, well, if I don't feel it, why would I do it? You know, kind of ironic though, that you were an anti-drug crusader and you went to the one place, it doesn't drug test. I know, right? It really hurt me. It hurt me. A crazy is, you know, and it is, if you look at, so we talked about like Singapore being so fantastic and having a really high GDP. A lot of the countries over there, uh, Indonesia, Manila, they, Manila, Philippines, um, they don't have huge high GDPs, right? I mean they're not super wealthy countries. And so when we think about, you know, how much it costs to buy a lot of the steroids that are readily available in America, they're just not as available.

Speaker 1:          01:59:14       And so I think they do have a point. And if you look at the athletes, there's not a lot of athletes that look like Yoel Romero. Now you'll notice probably not using, like I pointed out earlier, while he's tested clean, except once it was tainted supplement, but they proved that it was a tainted supplement. So when you look at their athletes, maybe except a few of the Russian ones, they look pretty normal. Like it's probably unlikely that they're using from my, for a few Russian ones, let's say for rocks and they can't help it. It's like part of the culture. I can't help it. Yeah. That one Russian, the one Russian guy that I fought in April of 16 he was freaking enormous. And you know, the other thing that I think a lot of MMA people are using some type of uh oh my gosh, I'm blanking.

Speaker 1:          01:59:58       What, what gives you endurance, EPO, EPO, that type of stuff. Because if you watch a college wrestler, that's how tired people get in seven minutes and then we're fighting 25 minutes and you're not going to get tired. Like that's not normal. Well, people definitely tested hot for that. And the UFC, who's the guy that fought mighty mouse? Yeah. There is a routine of Russia. Crazy. Yeah. So, but I think more people are using that. And I think if you, you know, you don't, I don't have any conclusive evidence, but if you look at when you sort of started and then how somebody is, people fell down straight down. Their bodies are different. They look different, they're competent, you know, Johnny Hendricks would be one that comes to mind. I mean, what's his freaking record since you saw it ain't very good. I'll tell you that much.

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       And all of a sudden he can't make weight. And you know, if you remember, so obviously I watched Johnny because he was, I couldn't stay on Johnny. He beat me when we were 17 and then I tried to wrestle my senior, so we were different. He was one 65, I was on 74 and I want to wrestle wrestling for the all star classic. And I called the, the people who put it on and said I want to wrestle him. And uh, they turned the match down. So that's, I've kind of like, I wanted to get that one back and I never got to get it back from when I was 17 so I've been falling giant pretty closely. If you watched Johnny like a constant fight and prior to that he gets so tired in like two rounds. Right? And we just felt exhausted, exhausted and then all of sudden he's going these five round fights and you're like, Whoa, how are you going to get tired and that exhausted in two rounds and now you can five for five rounds. Johnny, like what's going on here? I mean in his defense, I don't got to improve team take down. They, they implemented a pretty fantastic program over there. I mean they spend a lot of money on it. That was the whole thing where they were, they were paying him then they wanted 50% of his earnings. I got the same offer right out of college. You? Yeah, we were both Grad Joe Seven. How does that work?

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       I felt like he was betting it's myself. They pay you $100,000 a year for seven years. They got 50% of your career earnings. And I said, my thought was, well, if I ever make it really big, I'm going to make $1 million a fight and I'm going to pay him back in one fight. You know, like it's, it's a, it would be like hedging your bet against yourself and I don't ever bet against myself. Yeah. But for them I get it too. It's like they have to have some sort of a reason to put out there and it's a big bet whether or not you're going to be able to be. Absolutely. Plus if you think you suck, it's good to take that bet. If you think, I don't know if I'm going to make a dog, I'm okay with making it a little bit of money.

Speaker 4:          02:02:15       Yeah. Then it's a good bet. It doesn't seem like the best strategy. It doesn't seem, I mean it's interesting and I think, I think there's probably somewhere in there with, you know, I, I know a few manage it and it's where you go pick out, it's pretty proven that hello call adjusters are going to make really damn good fighters. That's pretty proven itself. Going to try to find a couple every year, spending some money on them and then getting a percentage of their earnings. It's probably a pretty, I don't want to say a safe bet for the people putting out the money, but it's, you know, take down team, take down, had Jake rush Holt who was an amazing wrestler and for whatever reason he just didn't transition great to fighting. Right. And you know, he was good but he wasn't great and it was like for as good of a wrestler's he was probably 30 it can be a little better.

Speaker 4:          02:02:55       Yeah. What do you think is the factor? Like if you had to look at it, the Mosler cause there's not a lot of outliers like that. Like where you don't like [inaudible]. And so when we talk about how good Jake, right, he still made the UFC, he still won some fights. So it was like he wasn't a bad fighter, but he's a three time NCAA champs. So you expect him, Hey, he'll probably go challenge for a UFC title. Right. So I, you know, in his case, I don't know what the factor was. Um, but there's not a lot of outliers like that where it's there are a really high level wrestler and then they don't have any success. MMA that's really unique. You don't see it a lot. Yeah, it's, it's interesting like I've looked at it from striking from if you see like really high level kickboxers some have a style that would readily translate to MMA and some are fantastic kickboxers like maybe Peter Hertz is a good example or a Nesto who's where I wouldn't really think that they would translate that well to MMA.

Speaker 4:          02:03:47       Whereas Mirko Cro cop who might've been like a slight notch below them in terms of kickboxing translates perfectly to MMA cause he's so explosive and quail and I would want them decent takedown defense too. He still kept it for a while. They developed it. But the thing about Mirko was unbelievable power and speed and he could just close the distance quickly and blast. Yeah. And I think that is w difference between that and a guy who's like methodical set things up. Those guys didn't do as well. They didn't translate as well. They get tooken taken down to what, what would you think would be like, well, it's, it's very different guns you don't want, the other things I think benefits us wrestlers is the fact that Jujitsu people are stuck on doing Jujitsu, the Jew two way, right? Strikers are stuck on striking when we come into MMA, we know we can't win a match just by wrestling.

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       Right? So we know, we know. I've got to add striking. I gotta I gotta add Jujitsu and I'm open to that idea, right? I'm open to those ideas that I have to add those things into my arsenal. Where'd you'd, some Jujitsu guys are like, well, I'm just going to submit them and they don't, they don't develop their, I mean there's, there, you can literally not name me Joe, uh, a Jujitsu guy or a striking guy. Well, maybe Jose Aldo who has developed high level wrestling, but you can name a lot of wrestlers who've developed high levels, something else, right? I mean, when you see the cross over, like Jon Jones was a wrestler, he can strike with pretty much anyone on the planet, right. It means steep meo chick was a wrestler. He can pretty much track when they don't on the planet. I mean, so you have these wrestlers who are becoming high level at these other skills, but you don't have a lot of other skills becoming a high level of wrestling.

Speaker 4:          02:05:27       And I, and I'm, for me, I think it's the stubbornness of people who come from those other backgrounds or too stubborn to want to work a lot in wrestling where it's wrestlers are like, okay, teach panel strike. Yeah. I think it's a, it's a recognition of what's important. Like George Saint Pierre is a perfect example of a garden. Started off with a killed Christian background, didn't wrestle in college or high school, became a fantastic restaurant. He's good. Yeah. And just figured it out and realized, realize what a critical skill it is too. Yeah, absolutely. So there's a handful of very small handful. Jose Aldo would be like, eh, he wasn't an offensive wrestler, but who'd be like, he was so ridiculously hard to take down. I mean fantastic takedown defense. And so there, there's a handful, but there's not a lot. And then, but then if you go to wrestlers going opposite direction into Jujitsu or striking, you know, you can name quite a few that were able to do those things really well.

Speaker 4:          02:06:12       You know, it's interesting when you see a guy like Khabib number Grumet off and you see these fantastic fuck yeah. And his, his mauling wrestling. I mean, you see what a massive factor it is. Fights like the Edson Barboza fight. Yeah. That to me is one of the perfect examples. When I say, look, the ability to take guy down and control them on the ground is the, it's the bottom of the pyramid. It's the most important foundation because he dictates where the fight takes place. Yeah. You might catch him when he's coming in and trying to get you, you might, but if he gets you, he was like a fricking terminator though. He was just like, I'm just going to come get you. Yeah. He just ate kicks for each address and there's no hope constant chasing him around chasing him. Right. It was. It was insane.

Speaker 4:          02:06:57       Yeah. No, he's fantastic. Yeah. But no, I would totally agree that at the bottom of the pyramid it's like the is the Trump card. If like if you fighting a wrestler and you can't stop a takedown, you're going to lose 90% of the time. Yeah. You know, and if, if you're the wrestler and you can go get a take down really easily, you're going to win 90% of the time. The only wild card in that equation is a guy like Brian or tig fights so well off his back. But how many people get submissions from garden? How many of those? Yeah, it's me. Even like any, any Anthony Pettis who got a lot of submissions regard. A lot of that was transitions off of I body kick, Benson Harrison, I body kick, Ben Sanders and Benson. Harrison hates getting body kicks. So he dives in for a take down. It gets arm armbar right. Or Guilt Melendez. Getting Guillotine

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       choke cause he got jacked a few times. Right. So there are, there's a handful of those but just strictly like I take you down, you're in guard, then I submit you right. Maybe for Bri silver doom every once in a while. Maybe Brian or Tega. But the numbers pretty damn small.

Speaker 3:          02:07:49       It is very small. It's smaller now than I think ever before because people understand the takedown, the guard defense.

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       Yeah. Even like this guy that I, so one of the things that frustrates you the most more than anything else that may is bad strategy. She was like, drives me up the wallet, that Lima thing. But this freaking knucklehead that fought Michael Chandler on uh, on Saturday. I didn't see it as names. Uh, Gordy Gordy. Yeah. Moo Cheer. I don't know his damn name is. So the first round he pulls guard like fast gets frikking hammered on for like four minutes and then he ends up on bottom again. The second round, third round he gets taken down and I dunno, 15 seconds. Did he try to get up one time? No, he just laid there and I was asked what performance in 45 seconds. Like everyone's while to try a comer. Everyone's while to try to triangle, but it's like, dude, you're getting your ass whipped. You're down two rounds and nothing. Try to get up, try to do something, change your strategy. If your strategy is not working, you can't just stick with the same bullshit and get your ass off for another four minutes or 45 seconds. I give me a break. What do you think's going to happen down there?

Speaker 3:          02:08:49       Well, I think some guys get locked into a defensive position. Like they realize they're getting overwhelmed and so they just try to survive. You think so? Yeah. Really? Yeah. You don't think that way because you're a champ and champions don't think that way. But for some people there's a, there's a acceptance of their, their fate, asphalt pennys. This is just, they're getting their ass whooped and so they just try to stay conscious. They try to just protect themselves as much as they can.

Speaker 1:          02:09:14       Kind of like Edson Barboza but then you know, it's an instrument. Edson Barboza you saw once he realized he was going to survive, like when it was like two minutes left and third round maybe ish site. The first round he's like, I'm getting, I'm getting fucked up. Just kind of, I'm just going to survive. Right? But then when there was a couple minutes left, he's like, no. And he was like, okay, I'm going to fight again. I want to make it through this shit. I might as well, if I were to make it through this, I might as well just fight back. Right. So he started fighting back really hard like the last two minutes f I tried. He certainly tried, but there was a period in the middle where he like had resigned to just taking an ass hole open.

Speaker 3:          02:09:44       Well, I think he was just, body was just not responding. He was getting so fucked up and you could see the pace that Habib put on a hard day. First round, like halfway into the Round Barboza is like Jesus Christ. You see the look in his eyes, got that thousand yard stare. It's like, Whoa, did I signed up for? Yeah, this guy's on another level. I mean he really is on another level. I'm fascinated by him fighting Tony Ferguson and apparently they're going to do that now. It's sitting happened April. I don't know if it's going to be for the interim title or the actual title within. They're going to strip Connor. They're in a weird,

Speaker 1:          02:10:17       I caught it beats up Tony. That's just my [inaudible] and I've underestimated Tony before so I could be wrong again. I just think, I think it's again, Trump card. I think Tony's kind of one of those guys where he's pretty good everywhere is pretty damn solid wrestling, high level Jujitsu. Uh, but I

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Khabib's wrestling, I mean better than Tony's wrestling, so it's going to end up on the ground. And I think Tony's going to think he can submit him because his Jujitsu is very high level, but I think it'll be one those things where it could be just good enough not to get submitted. And then he's going to land damage and land damage, inland damage, inland damage. And Tony's going to get close to a submission and close to a submission, close to a submission, but not quite get it. And then all this damage is going to just accumulate and accumulate and accumulate. That's Kinda how I see it going. It's fascinating. And I also think it's fascinating now that could be, but has changed his training and has a real nutritionist, had no problem making weight. Yeah. So all of the factors that played into him getting removed from the last time they were supposed to fight, pulled out of the car.

Speaker 4:          02:11:15       That was kind of overblown. He only missed weight one time. He only missed w wait one time. But his body shut down when he's making me wait for the Michael Johnson fight in a similar way. But he still did the Michael Johnson fight. Yeah. But it was the same thing happened on the way and it was a rough way in. But there's been other guys who missed weight many times. I mean, if we go to a Johnny Hendricks, Johny Hendricks, Melvin Gallard, Calvin gasoline, and they missed it by a long way. So I thought the cube thing kinda overplayed. He missed weight one time. He had some injuries which sucked for him. Um, but it was, that was happening for a world title fight, you know, fighting for the interim title. He misses for you. Yeah, I mean, and so it one of those where he probably just like, it was like okay for him to make it but be difficult and they just got just a little bit too big.

Speaker 4:          02:11:57       I said, was it for world interim title when he was supposed to, I don't think it was the original time. It was Kevin Lee. Right? That was for the world time. Yeah. Yeah. Or interim title. Job Title. Yeah. The whole, that whole division is kind of fucked up with Conner. Not even knowing whether or not he's fighting it. They're going to strip him, right? Yeah, mostly I think so. I would imagine. Unless Connor says, fuck it, I'm in, I think the best comeback. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. I want to keep me belt. I know the best course of action strip Connor let, let, could be even Tony fight it out and then it Kinda of was going back. Give him a title shot that's going to happen. Whatever. Well, I think what would be the most lucrative thing is Connor versus GSD. Joe Ought to fight GSP. Oh you do? I want to be number one. I don't want to fight Tyron cause we've been your friends for 20 years. Uh, I wanna fight GSP that that's who I want to fight. Do you think that they would set that up? They would try to set up GSP versus Tyron. Right. That would be super fun. GSP doesn't want to fight anyone who can hit hard because he's worried about the brain damage. Yeah. I don't hit that hard.

Speaker 4:          02:12:58       Right. Interesting way of looking at it on a train with GSP, I've never changed. So I've trained with almost every top what the weight of this era except GSP. Really. Yeah. Well GSP and Rory, but uh, shields, Fitch, Diaz, a couple times tire and obviously, um, you know, go down the line. I've trained with pretty much everyone in this era. What do you feel like if you do wind up retiring, what do you feel like you'll, you'll wind up doing? Just coach and coach wrestling. I love doing it. Really enjoyed a lot so I could, I don't think I'd go back to the collegiate level. It's obviously

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       always an option. It went for the four years I coach called dress and I loved it, you know? And then it was like, Hey, I won the belt. Hotels making a lot of money. I should probably try to be good at this instead of just doing it halfway, you know? Right. And so I did that and then, you know, we opened the wrestling schools and now it's going a little on it. I really enjoyed that a lot. And you know, there's positives and negatives. Like I love coaching at the highest level, being able to talk about his level to the college guys. So I missed that part a little bit. But then obviously if you go work for a institution like that, there's gonna be a lot of bureaucracy. And I worry about that. I don't like that. I love owning my own business and having my own freedom and not having to worry about what I tweet or what I say or heaven with telling me what to do or where to be or where to dress or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:14:16       Like I don't like. So I love that freedom obviously. Then running your own business has its own challenges also. So I think I will coat dress on for the rest of my life, whether I fight once more where they don't fight once more, I'll probably call Jonathan for the rest of my life. Awesome. Yeah.
