Speaker 1:          00:00:07       President United States 20, 24. Dave Smith is with me. Is that a real date? What is that? A date was 2024. That wouldn't be it, right? 16, 20 slash 20 slash eight when I'll be ready. Dude. You could pull it off when entered a real libertarian candidate that could fucking hang in there. Someone who's going to break the mold. Dave Smith and a stand up comedian as well. I didn't want this task, but now that Joe Rogan's called you could do it. You're immune to all the trappings that hit all those people. Of course there's dirt on you. You're a part of skank fest. You know it's going to be. There's a lot of grabbing by the postseason. You're on a podcast called the legion of skanks. It's could be introduced in a presidential debate and then I have to go. Yes, that was my shower. Yes, but you would do it just like that and everybody would start laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       We're realizing that this just do it like a politician or I'd be like, I repudiated that show years ago. I no longer associate with big joker seven dude speaking in which they put wiener in the pokey today. Twenty one months in jail for sexting. I believe it was a 15 year old. Well look, I. That guy, single handedly probably changed America. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think she really did, but he changed it through Dick Pics. Which. How else were you going to change America in 2017? The road edge, Anthony Windier. It gets hard time. Is that the post? The Post is hilarious. Whoever writes for the post, Goddamn they have some fucking great headlines. Anthony Wiener gets hard time. Oh, you know what's horrible is before all this happened, he was fantastic. That guy could have been the president. He was. He had that politiciany thing. I mean he was he and he was like for a young politician on the fast track.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       Yeah. But he, I mean, I really do think Hilary Clinton. I mean, I just think it was such a close race that any little thing probably could have made the difference. So you could blame any number of factors, but I mean the FBI coming out and reopening and investigation on you like less than two weeks before an election. That's pretty tough to get over politically. Like in any normal year, any candidate would be buried by the. After all that, lock her up, lock her up. There's no way you can survive that. The FBI is looking into it. All the people that don't want to look into it any further than the surface, they immediately go, oh, we fucking got heads over. And I, you know, like I think there's also just in terms of the politics and the way people work, there was something about Anthony Wiener were so it just, it made the American public think about him again.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       And trump was bringing the women who are accusing Bill Clinton of rape to the debates. And I think the average person just kind of went like, wait a minute. So. So your husband is a sexual Predator art and your best friend, her husband is also a sexual predator. Like who the fuck are these people? Who the fuck are you that the story for. Yeah, well that's one of the that got me about Fox News because Fox News has always been the voice of conservative America on television, right. These staunch verse, the staunch Voice of conservative America, but yet all this sex stuff comes out like the bill o'reilly tapes where he was calling up as whoever the girl was and saying crazy shit with a loofa sponge. Remember all that? The, I read about it. It was crazy, but they had recordings of it and then it was, you know, the, all the women that accused him of sexual harassment and sexual harassment with other people and other people are sending Dick pics and like, wow, you guys are freaks.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       And you know, it was really crazy about it was that so Roger Ailes, who is the head of the network, she went down first for sexual harassment and then as soon as he was down like a whole bunch of other people started going back and then you really start wondering like, Oh shit. Like was it just like a new guy isn't letting us sexually harass anymore? What's going on with this? Well, I think it was just there was a culture that they could get away with before the Internet where they were the bosses and the women were the underlings and they all felt. I'm sure there's probably a lot of dynamics plan there, right? There's a power situation. The man, the guy who's the boss is in position and then there's also women that are attracted to power figures and then there's also this conservative like really repressed environment, which always leads to freak shit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       It always does. Yeah. We have like people buttoned down. They always lead to frequently. They have to find a way out that pressure. It's got to go. You're right. I mean, I always say to people, if you're in a. If you're in New York City, if you go to a bar in the financial district, like right after work, it's a really crazy scene. Something interesting like the exact dynamic you're talking about. Whereas these people who are all day working in this crazy like this and then like the ties are loosen. Then it's this like drinking and they take their shoes off at the bar and I'm like, whoa. People are getting slapped on the ass like crazy shit is going on that you wouldn't think your banker, you know the guy, the guy who runs your retirement account. You know why? Because like we were talking about before with like before the podcast started with like these ancient reward systems, there's an ancient reward system for plundering.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       I really believed that. I think these guys feel like their goddamn pirates, like they're plundering, makes sense. They're part of the financial market and then they're doing shots. We're going to fucking check and take them down. They grab each other, we're going to fucking take them down. We're going to take them down. And if you think about, I mean if you think about the acquisition of property of goods or anything like that throughout human history, I mean the idea of like a, just a theory of just acquisition of property is like relatively new and the way everything was acquired for all of human history was through conquest. Just, you know, you take it, you take other people's Shit and you got to think that like a hostile takeover must feel incredibly like sacking the city. Again, these guys, oh, that's from Wall Street from uh, what's his name wasn't Wall Street.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       What the fuck was it called? A wolf of Wall Street. Yeah. Yeah. That was a great scene. But people resonate. That scene resonated with people. I'm not fucking going. I'm not fucking going. And everybody said it's like being above the system kind of tapping in just same way football taps in. It's tapping into this ancient reward system for plundering when men get together and they fuck up other men and take all their shit and then we kick ass. It's unbelievable how much. I thought about this a lot this last year through the election, but like it's unbelievable how much like that football team dynamic is just the whole thing. Like it's like human beings love to get into a stadium to be like red team, blue team identified with one team and lose their freaking minds. Like literally lose their minds and that's when they know it's meaningless.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       It's just about a ball crossing a line. And this has absolutely no. We'll still bring God into it with brand team into all these. And again, you see like with this trump thing now that he just stepped on, me and Jamie were joking around before we started like a, or it's like he, he liked threatening nuclear war and insulted Steph curry in, in one thought I'd ever. Everyone in America is like, excuse me, what was that second? Excuse me? What did you say? And both sides, like this is just what gets them interested. Well, we are a gossip country now, like 100 percent officially, like what we'd like is a squabble between the leader of the free world who is a reality star and some of the best basketball players that have ever lived. Like, Oh shit, it's on football players. I mean Le Bron James is making videos about the president being a douchebag.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       He's making videos about all these different people like expressing their right to free speech. I saw one of the tweets that he, uh, he tweeted out at the president where it was like, just kind of like a broken English tweet. Like he used the word ain't a lot in it, just like. And it's just him verse trump. And I just had a moment where I was like, so this is where the national conversation is at now, like, do you remember, I just remember watching like a William f Buckley vs Gore v down to Bates. And you're like, how fucking retarded has our country gotten? Have you seen the documentary? Yeah, it's amazing. Really interesting. If you haven't seen it focuses on Netflix. What is it called? Something I don't remember. Bitter rivals. Yeah. No, that's something that's called bitter rivals. That might've been a UFC event back in the early two. Thousands. Sylvia, best of enemies. Enemies. Thank you. Stupid pattern. I don't know. 50 four obliteration. Yeah, I was saying they're gonna run out of adjectives and they realized eventually we are. This is so stupid. But you don't ever say. It's never like a verse. Sixers slam fest. Total slam fest. Yeah. Like you'd never have a name. It's just the world series. It's just the fucking super bowl. It's never. It was never a, you know, domination event. Oh, they figured it out somewhere along line. But

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       what we're talking about. Oh yeah, how crazy it is to see that this is all going on while Puerto Rico has no power and only five percent of it has cell phone service. Holy Shit. You want to talk about. There's some. There's a weird racist thing that we will like if that was an island filled with white people, do you really truly think it was an island filled with white people that spoke perfect English and it sounded just like us. Do you think we have so little coverage of Puerto Rico the way we do now? Oh, Puerto Rico is technically a part of the United States. It's not a state, but it's technically like we had on Peter Schiff. Yes. We just had a mother who was was fantastic. Amazon. He just moved his whole team down there. Boy, Betty's regretting that now for a guy who's known for predicting the future, he really, really missed that one was like that moment and that that animated Gif with that black kid has got glasses and a and everyone around us doesn't.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       He just did Peter Schiff. For guys knowing to predict the future where he did fucking do, you don't see the destruction of your empire by God himself. Turns out you can only predict the subprime mortgage crisis, not acts of God. Fuck Dude. And there's another one along the way. Look at this one, this one over and over again. This is great. That kids faces fucking classic. Like if he shut you down and gave you that face, you'd be like, fuck. He got me. There was no counter argument after this has happened to you, but you just accept that you lost. Yeah, I mean you might be able to like gain some ground afterwards with a couple of good insults, but fucking contest is over. If that's like a halfway through a roast battle, just call it for the judges to know when to walk away to with a loss because it's way worse if you stay there and keep swinging.

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       Just keep getting fucked up. When that guy gives you that face, you gotta go, you gotta go get. I'll come back and fight another blocks. Pilots about. Definitely can't believe it. I mean, that might be like one of the V perfect events in human history. Forget about like, uh, you know, planting the flag and Iud Jima, this dude, this dude making that face that will be used, who knows how many, countless hundreds of thousands of times. How many times did that thing been used? It maybe millions, right? If, if a youtube video get millions of hits, that's probably in the millions. Millions of times used for sure. Right. But yeah, so it's a weird fucking time with all this because we're concentrating so much on weird stuff. Like whether or not you should stand for the flag or Neil and first of all, I think what they're doing, if correct me if I'm wrong, they're protesting cops shooting innocent people.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       That's what it's about. So it's kind of ineffective on their part, the message, because you have to listen to them afterwards. Right? It seems like you don't like America, right? That's what people have a problem with and trump's plan on that, that they get down on one knee and you know, I mean, it's kind of weird because it's kind of respectful as all. Also getting down on one knee for the flag is actually more respectful than putting your hand over your heart, which is really weird. Right, so they. They're supposed to be protesting cops who have shot innocent unarmed people, which have been a fuck load of them, but that's a weird way to do it because you're doing it during the anthem. The anthem isn't those cops. The anthem is all of us, so it's. It's a shitty way to divide because it's not really making a whole lot of sense because the people who wrote the star spangled banner who were singing it right now, the people who have sung it all throughout the years and stood there, they aren't the ones that shot those unarmed people.

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       What you have is a cop who was a probably a nervous wreck, most likely has been operating with ptsd for the past five, six fucking years. You have friends that are cops. A few. Yeah. They tell you crazy shit, right? Yeah. You know, I know a bunch of cops, especially from Jujitsu. I know a ton of cops and and from the UFC as well. They tell you some fucking horror stores, things that they have to deal with, like they stumble upon a crime scene. Guys got half his fucking head missing people chopped up, you know, all sorts of dark, dark, dark shit and it's in their head all the time. They've had buddies get shot in the face at, you know, routine traffic stops. Everybody's freaked out because over the course of 20 years, you're a police officer. You have seen a fucking amazing amount of shit, probably unfit for the job.

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       These guys that are shooting people and we think about the vast number of people that are cops that aren't doing this, the Internet, all the interactions were concentrating on these terrible things that obviously there's no defense for it, right? There's no, no, no, no. Defending someone shooting a 13 year old boy with a plastic gun. There's no. There's no defending any of the crazy stuff that we saw. The Guy who shot the guy and he had planted the Taser. There's no defending any of this. Right, but how many interactions are cops having with people where this doesn't happen? A fuckload man, like let's keep some perspective because the other end and if you live in a country with 320 million people and you see one incident or a few incidents there, there's no perspective there so you can find it. Any, any example to paint whatever narrative you want to.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       If you're just going off random examples. God, I really like it. It's really frustrating for me because the whole. It's like the whole trump thing and the whole moment we're in now, it's all about a culture war. Like that's what it's really about. It's not about politics or policy or anything. It's really a culture war and what you have here and this is why everyone gets so into the kneeling for the national anthem thing because it's symbolic of two cultures and to me it's like I, I, I see the worst in both, which is really frustrating. So it's like the left wing thing is just this bash America with no perspective, like no fucking perspective at all. So it's like, yeah, I'm right. So there'll be protesting, say like cops being shot or something like that, which you can say certainly there are legitimate cases of that and I'm a person who

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       believes we have like a real real police problem in America and, and we have like just insane amounts of arrests for nonviolent crimes, really fucked up, Shangri mass incarceration, all these fucked up things. Um, uh, that being said like there's also justifiable shootings, shoot cops do, you know? Um, but so, so you have these people taking a neat. But it's kind of like symbolic to people who aren't on the left of this culture of like everything over the law on the left is just like anti America, anti capitalist, Anti White Man, anti man in general and anti Western civilization with no perspective, like no perspective of like, you know, just like Americans is white supremacist country. It's like, well, what does that mean? Like compared to what, you know what I'm saying? And I'm not saying it doesn't exist, it's like, but it's like when they say like we live in a rape culture, it's like what does that mean?

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       If I'm like, we live in a robbery culture, there are robberies, but compared to what? So if you're going to say we're a white supremacy culture, to me it's kind of like saying, it's like saying America is a poor country. I mean, I, I suppose compared to some richer country in the future that's figured some shit out that we haven't compared to everything else that's ever existed. We're a rich country. So if you're talking about white supremacy, it's like, well no, by and large were probably the best like melting pot and most diverse, most inclusive, most, uh, like we feel more guilty for the sins of our past than pretty much any other country commercial. And I don't know any country that like, you know, it's like America was founded by conquest of the native Americans. It's like, right. And so as every single other country, and so, and every country had slavery in every country had all these things.

Speaker 3:          00:16:19       It's not no one, 150 years ago, it wasn't fucked up. That doesn't exist. Right? And so if you have some perspective, the left wing thing gets pretty frustrating after awhile. However, then on the, on the trump side, so I've kind of been more sympathetic to the right than the left probably over the last year and a half because I really do see like the issue of our time becoming this like are you for free speech are against free speech that that to me is like really because we don't really figure things out unless we get to debate them. We can't have been topics and we can have topics that are supercharged to the point where they're. You can't have a position on them. Yeah. And you can't explore them. There is a real powerful. Yes. Yes. That's it. That's exactly right. I mean it's, it's one reason I think there's many reasons, but that's one of the most important.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       Like why we need free speech because unless you fucking. Unless you come from the position of I have everything 100 percent correct. Like then maybe you need to have a conversation and someone has a conversation back with you because odds are you don't have everything 100 percent correct. It's their correct versus your correct. Like they're correct. Is Gender Quality? They're correct. Is transgender rights? They're correct. Is Socialism there? Correct. Is like, and if you. Obviously I'm talking about people far left, not talking about you. If you're listening just I'm talking about the hypothetical extreme far left person that is protesting Ben Shapiro on Berkeley campus calling him a Nazi, but this isn't. This isn't just, you know, a right, it's not you're making, you're talking about a hypothetical person, but obviously this is happening in reality. They exist lots of them and there's enough to the point where like it's like this real thing where, okay, so the great threat to free speech and our time isn't coming from the state, which by the way, like as a libertarian that would be more comfortable to my narrative.

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       Like that's what I've been thinking for years is the great threat to free speech. But no, it's coming from this left wing culture that says a right. Like Ben Shapiro can't speak Milo Yiannopoulos can't speak Condoleeza Rice can't speak about it. Look, if, if Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson need to be silenced, I mean that. My only problem with those two is that there to moderate. Like these are like, these are not bigots, these are not these, these are intellectuals making an intellectual argument and they can't even speak. So it's, it's very scary. And then the other thing I would just say on this left wing culture and is what cabarnet kind of embodies to meet is just the, it's this frustrating ignorance like this client. So you'll be protesting police brutality and mass incarceration and then like you'll put a Castro image on your jacket. Like, I mean, come on man.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       Come on dude. You can't, you can't stand up for something and swing and miss that big like that. So like you got to research a little bit, I mean do five minutes. All the information is on your phone. Like I just don't. So there's that and I get being against that and I want to be like on the free speech side and I see a lot of these guys like who will bring up like Steven crowder and Ben Shapiro guys you've had on your show who I really admire a lot because they're fighting against that. And Jordan Peterson fighting against that anti authoritarian authoritarian pc antifreeze speech stuff. So I kind of more sympathetic to the right, but then there's this thing with the nfl where, and it really just reminds me of all the cultural aspects of the right that I hate, which is when, first of all, I'm sorry, someone who's standing for freedom of speech.

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       I'm pretty fucking troubled by the president of the United States, the man who's in control of the most powerful army in the military and the history of human humanity coming out and saying, I think if someone takes a need, they should be fired. Now that may not be writing a law against a speech, but that's pretty fucking chilling to have like the government telling you, hey, you know, what would please me is if you started firing people when they spoke out against me, I don't like that. And this fucking right wing, like praise the flag. And if you say anything against it, you're, you're in a. it's like religious, like it's blast for me. It is a criticize the troops or criticized the country. Like fuck that. Yeah, it is a power issue. When I was going to say earlier is that when you were talking about the state, when you were talking about the fear of the state and the censorship coming from the state, it's the same thing because the state is just power and the far left is power too and it's power with shame and with blogs and with protests and it is the power that they're trying to exercise to get you to behave the way they want you to and the right does the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:20:30       I think what we should have if we're gonna, if we're gonna really keep doing this whole, we're a country thing. We should have like an armistice when then this is I think reasonable people. Reasonable people have an issue with this idea of desecrating the flag because the flag is just a flag and it's not important,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       but what is important is that we treat each other like we're a team and we look out for each other and we're all together and we're all united together. We shouldn't be fun. If we have an issue, our issue should be with communist dictatorships across the world that have nuclear weapons that are holding their people captive, like if it was ever a time to look at a country and go, wow, this is a country that is in an unjust position and it's a really terrifying dilemma that you have this murderous dictator who's in control of nuclear weapons and he has an entire country of people enslaved, which is essentially what's going on in North Korea. Right. It's basically like a giant hostage situation that's, that's a real giant issue to us. It's not whether or not transgender people can use the fucking males, the men's room or the women's room.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       That's not our issue. That's, that's, that's a cultural conversation and that cultural conversation should become. And we should be friendly to each other because we're supposed to be on the same team though. I agree with you, but that stuff with the like the transgender bathrooms, I got to say man, and it's really weird for me sometimes I just can't. I can't even believe I hold some of the positions I do because I grew up like a kind of left wing kid and uh, you know, I was raised by a single mom in New York. I kind of like, that's kind of where I belong culturally, but I really can't, you know, it's almost like the Kooky conservatives who, the religious coogee conservatives who I just dismissed for years is like, this is just insane. Had more of like they had a grain of truth that I didn't realize they'd be like, uh, you know, you can't legalize gay marriage or they'll start coming after the kids and you're like, well, that's just insane.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       Anybody like gay marriage gets legalized it. Like the next year they're like, kids should be able to take hormones to suppress the. And you're like, Whoa, this is kind of weird. It's very weird to me that the left didn't take like a minute to celebrate this victory on gay marriage that they had been fighting for like my entire life. They got a huge victory. The Supreme Court came in and forced it on the remaining 20 states or so who weren't ready. We weren't going to vote for it. They forced it on them and there wasn't a big backlash like that. One chick went to jail for like three days. It's not like the one in Oklahoma with gay folks, Wendy Davis Owens, and then she and then it's not like, oh, there was like this wave of Republicans who rose up like, we're going to repeal it. We're going to write a law to reverse that supreme court decision.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       It's like, no, actually they elected the first pro gay marriage president. It's like you won on this issue and immediately as soon as they won, they're like, now transgender bathrooms. Now this now. Well, I think, I don't think they're related. And this is why I think, um, first of all, the gay marriage thing is consenting adults. They should be able to do whatever they want to do. The difference between gay people and transgender people is pretty radical. No great. If almost the same difference as between straight people and gay people there. But they're in the same four letters according to the left, but that whole Lbgtq a plus, whatever the fuck it is now, there's a bunch of new ones that they've added on asexual. No, I agree with you. I think it's actually insulting that they lumped them together as if it's the same thing. I mean, I think it's a weird that when trump tweeted the thing

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       about trans people not being able to serve in the military, I saw a bunch of people being like, trump has come out against lgbt rights and you're like, what the hell does this have to do with lg? Or be like, what? Why is that crazy? They're just a gang. Lump it all together. A big progressive gang of acronyms, but the, the. They're always going to say about all this stuff being lumped in together is that the left has been the side that has looked towards the hard science when it comes to global warming. Right? The hard science when it comes to climate data, those are the ones that are always pushing whether they're right or wrong or getting the right data. They're the ones that are really harping on the science and if you looked in terms of the amount of people that are working in universities, there are far more left than there are far more left.

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       Professors now are right, so you would think, okay, you have this base of academia and knowledge on the left, but yet the left is the side that's willing to entertain the idea that a young kid should take hormones to alter their sex. When you know for a fucking fact that when you're a young person, you're extremely confused, constantly back and forth, left and right. There are hormonal changes. The cerebral cortex, the frontal cortex isn't even really fully develop. They don't say you're a real fully developed until you're like 25 if you're a man, which explains a lot of the shit that I did. Right. It's a lot of people listening that are 20 and retarded that like, what the fuck am I doing with my life? Exactly. Dude. You're barely an adult. Oh, you're thinking about things you do at like 22 and you're like, I can't believe I'm the same human human, but so this same party, the same progressive mindset that is so incredibly open minded but yet also so deeply embedded in academia like far more than the right is this is the side that is willing to put aside all that they know about biology and psychology and physiology and children.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       Put aside that a lot of people are not all in one lump. Anybody together put aside that for Progressive Brownie points for saying that you are so incredibly open. Like this child obviously knows that he is a. She or she is a he and we need to start addressing them as that and this is just a fact. Well, it's not just a fact. It's a conversation that we should have and I think it varies in individuals and I think there are some people that I have personally talked to the transgender people that for sure are happier being a woman or a man and they were born in what they feel is the wrong body. And I absolutely 100 percent salute their right to go out and do that, but we should have a real conversation as to how many people is that really happening to me? How many of these people have a psychological issue? How many people. Is there a physical trait that we're missing? Is there a, some, some switch that gets flipped when they're young? I mean it's a fascinating aspect of human beings that you are one sex and wish you were another. Right. And it seems strange to me that on the left the rules always seem to be. There's this topic like it's like the left forever. It's

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       always like we need to have a national conversation about race. But if you say the wrong thing, I want you ruined. Yeah. You know. And it's the same thing with like the transgender thing. It's like they want to like, it's like we want to have a conversation about this. They put this forward as like this is an issue we need to talk about. And then also, by the way, you're not allowed to say anything. So if you bring up the 40 percent suicide rate and say maybe this isn't due to societal oppression because there's no real link between societal oppression and high suicide rates, now you need to be fired or something, you know, say 40 percent of transgender people commit suicide and the people that want to support the idea that there's not any sort of a mental illness in any people on shore.

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       It's not in some. We're not generalizing, but it must be in some. Right. The people that want to deny that side of the reason why they are suicidal is because they don't get a chance to express their genuine, authentic self, which is a very good point. So it's not. It's not that either or. No, I'm. I'm open to the argument, the argument that the 40 percent is possibly. It's maybe a combination of those two factors. Maybe there's some people that are mentally ill that are suicidal in the first place and they hope that maybe becoming a woman would make them feel better and it didn't work out. There's a. there's a whole website where people, I think it's called transgender regret or something like that and it's all people that switched over and we're like really upset that they did it and then realized it was like some strange phrase they were going through or whatever, and then you know, there's, there's people that are sure suicidal because they want to be one way and people just constantly shit on them and bullied him and heckle them and they, that's what's causing them to be so deeply.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       It's not like one or the other. No. And I think in every individual case there's probably like a complex, a complex set of different cause causing factors. So yeah, I agree with that. I just think it's like, no matter how low, obviously I'm for, you know, like everyone owns their own body and she's able to do whatever they want to it. If you can find a doctor who was willing to perform a surgery on you, you know, whatever surgery you want to have. And, and I think transgender people should have the freedom to do that. Truthfully speaking though, I don't really see anyone. Not that anyone is in saying that, but I don't really see anyone disagreeing with that. You know, like most people seem to agree are people that think it's a sickness and they absolutely shouldn't be allowed to, but what is it seems like that's pretty rare.

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       Like even the people who are getting a lot of, a lot of heat for, for their stance on transgender issues. Like I've never heard Gavin mcinnes say it should be illegal. I've never heard like Ben Shapiro say it should be illegal. What they will say is that I'm not going to pretend that you're a what? You're a woman. I'm going to acknowledge that you have a y chromosome. Like that to me is like okay, that has nothing to do with your freedom to have a surgery. He, this guy has a free freedom of thought to describe what's going on and it is kind of crazy like you said with the global warming thing. Like it's like, yeah, the left Prague themselves on being the science party. Like we believe in science. Although the problem is that I try very hard to like wrap my head around all of these different issues and I've read a decent amount on climate change and I'm pretty tough, pretty tough stuff. It's not

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       easy. It's not like some of these other issues that are much easier to understand and I will say that about 90 percent of the people on the left who are like have the science, they haven't looked into it. They've just been told this is the science and they're like, oh great. Now I get to bash people by having the science because if you're going to say like you're the side that that believes in science. I'm sorry to deny that there are biological effects on biological effects on gender is, but that's science as you be such a small fringe group that do make that distinction. They think that there's no biological difference in the sexes there. Those people are really just crazy. The idea of pushed it so far, they're so far left that there in some crazy alternative reality. There are a lot of those.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       I look at it like the same way a year. Like, um, scientologists have like their levels I look at like, like left wing ideology, jc or something like the social justice warrior who's like out in the front lines protesting Christina Hoff summers. She's like top level left wing mindset, but there's a lot. But no, the idea that gender is a social construct is pretty well accepted I think on the left. And to me that is insane. That's true. I think it's only accepted in a very fringe group, especially academics. Maybe you're right, and people in school that protest about it and people that are super active social justice warriors. I think if you polled people, whether or not they think there's a biological difference and you gave them three choices. Yes, no. And Dha that most people would say, Da Da, here's what, here's the only thing I'll just, I, I, I think you're 100 percent right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       If they were taking that test anonymously, anonymously to put their names behind it, I think you'd get a much different answer. I talk to college professors, like my sister's a college professor. I talked to our friends. I talked to other people. A lot of them will come up to me and it's almost like this thing, like at a dinner table, it's like get close and be like, hey, just so you know, I really agree with you on like a lot of stuff and I'm not, you know, like it'll be like the people who for, for the one Jordan Peterson, who by the way a guy like Jordan Peterson really does beg the question, why aren't there more Jordan Peterson's like, why is it just you and five other people? Why are there not more professors? And the reason is because they're all intimidated. Look at all the shit he's had to deal with.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       They're all intimidated by that. Bret Weinstein, who's a super progressive guy, I mean he's way left and he got shamed and he got like literally threatened. I mean, and now he just won a lawsuit though. He just got paid $500,000. We had him on like right after Evergreen College had to shut down and kids were patrolling the fucking parking lot with baseball bats. Looking for him. Like it was really crazy, man. It's insane. Really crazy stuff that the left, I mean, imagine if that was coming from the right, you would start calling them Nazis. He started calling them white supremacists. You start calling them thugs, but on the left they conveniently ignore the same types of pattern. It's so unbelievable. Like the double standard of life. A dude will look. So you have like the, the, the thing that happened in Charlottesville, right where you have like, I mean I'm a few hundred

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       people marched and, and I guess there were dozens of them at least at least who were like wearing Nazi gear, which is, you know, don't get me wrong. I mean it's pretty eyeopening and like, Holy Shit, I mean, what? It's, it's like disturbing and kind of very. It very interesting to me that anyone in 2017 in America is putting a swastika on. Not only that, these dumb fucks got together in public with lit their face with torches so everybody can take video and photos of them and March student street together, yelling like blood and soil and all sorts of weird fucking shit. Like what would the quotes that they do you remember? What the Jews will not replace us was. Wow. What can I tell you is that as a Jewish person, I've never felt more empowered in my life than the Jews will not replace what an unbelievable.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       Like I've never even entertained the idea of replacing anybody. And then when they're like, the Jews will not replace us. I think we can replace these motherfuckers got worried about it. Let's make a move. Jews, let's go replace these Charlottesville. How many people were there? The protest? 100. I think between three and $400. That's it. That's it. That's a good size crowd. That would be psyched if they came to see me, right? If I, if I walked into that on the road, I'd be like, oh, that was the line again. Theater. You're like, oh, we're doing good tonight. And they'd be like, it's pretty white supremacy in Italy and here. There really, uh, I mean, at first I thought it was well lit. Can they bring their Tiki torches inside or a sticker on a dirt outside? Who's going to funny to watch those fires and how to get to know which torches yours has got the.

Speaker 3:          00:34:14       We got a guy, we have numbers. We got it all figured out yet she passed Walmart Torch when you had a nice home depot torch. Good solidly constructed American Home Depot Choice and some dude stole your shit and left you with some main Chinese bullshit. That would be. I'll vto bullshit and it's probably just good enough that you get halfway through the march before you're like, wait a minute. Look up and you see made in China. Fuck. I knew this felt light used to have a little American flag under each. A little metal bonnet. Let's get real. They were all made in China. Yeah. Probably. This is not a big market for Tiki torches, but anyway, I was saying, but these guys like, I mean nobody even like people who are real far ahead on the right wing who are like pretty, you know, considered, you know, like whoever, like Ben Shapiro who was being protested by these guys, he doesn't associate with any of those guys.

Speaker 3:          00:34:58       I disgusted by them. Gavin McInnes won't associate with any of these guys. He's disgusted by them. These guys can't even speak at their own rallies. They don't come to the right wing. Does a, I think a fairly decent job at just being like, no we're not. We're not even associated with trump. Did Not denounce them correctly. Well, no, I don't think so. I mean, look, from what I saw, I actually thought it was a weird reaction to what trump said. It's like, it's like, so what I'm saying is I see this going on here with, with the one thing that happened in Charlottesville, right? And I haven't seen too much Nazi stuff outside of that, right on the Internet. But I mean like in terms of response. But this will just make this point because I to address what you're saying. But. So then this happened, this one limited.

Speaker 3:          00:35:40       There's one thing with a few hundred people in Charlottesville happened. The media goes fucking nuts. Like, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened on the other side, on the left wing side, everywhere that someone tries to have a free speech rally everywhere. Anyone who's, who's one step to the right of Bernie Sanders wants to speak like Condoleezza Rice can't speak like anyone who's one step to the right of Bernie Sanders gets shut down. And there is this mob, okay, called Antifa, who, who actively go after assaulting people who, and this isn't just Nazis, they go after trump supporters or anyone, anyone who disagrees with them, they were hammer and sickle flags, which is, you know, represent representing an ideology that killed more people than the Nazis. So, you know, let's put them both on the level of like genocidal horrible, uh, groups. However, this one group on the left is going everywhere across the country and are given comfort and aid by college professors.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       So when, then my ears. Yes, yes, there actually. And when it's brought up and it's actually backed up by things like 40 percent of millennials in a Chicago University, a study, a state, they don't believe in free speech for hate speech, which basically means you don't believe in free speech. You've got about 40 percent of millennials who don't believe in free speech. You have to define hate speech. And that's where things get slippery and what you might call hate speech is so different from me, right? What I might, what you might call hate speech is me saying that I don't want to call a transgender woman, uh, her right? That well, let's. And that has been, that has been labeled hate speech. That's a microaggression. These are all. So it's like, once you define that, it's like, oh, you can punch a Nazi. But by the way, everyone who disagrees with me as a Nazi, I am against hate speech.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       And by the way, anything I don't like I'm offended by is hate speech. And, and that's the whole idea of freedom of speech is to protect unpopular speech. It's not there. So we can talk about things that don't offend you. Obviously. No one has a problem with that, but so you have this on the left, which this math problem, and then the media demands that everyone on the right denounce this non existent thing, so when trump can on a nonexistent thing was disturbing, was seeing hundreds of people walking down the street with torches, yelling out racist things together as a group, and the only thing that was differentiating, differentiating their idea was so much more stupid than the free speech idea because their idea was just to differentiate people based on how much melanin in their skin and what part of the planet their ancestors came from.

Speaker 3:          00:37:57       That's one of the dumbest fucking ideas in human history. So what you have is this river of dumb dumbs walking down the street and the president doesn't say that. The president doesn't say he's the guy who's running the country, right? He doesn't say, Hey, this is the lowest form of stupidity that we know of with humans. The lowest form of stupidity is to accept everyone that looks like you. This is so fucking stupid. You're pretending that someone has any power whatsoever over where they were born, their national origin, who their parents were. You don't, you don't have any fucking power over that. So you're putting all the power and things that you have zero control with. That means you're a fucking loser. Alright, and that means the only thing that you got to bank on is this white skin, the unity of in workforce. This is the group that you're lumping everybody together with and you don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       Do you not know any great black people do not know any great Hispanic or Latino people you don't know any. Well then you need to get the fuck out of your neighborhood, the ignorance, but I think that applies to that thing you're saying about kind of being like a loser and then grasping to some collective because you don't have anything in your own story to really cling to life. I agree with you, but that's. I mean I think that applies to people who get into this identity bullshit on all sides. I don't disagree. It's like, yeah, I mean for a second about the president, Short, short, but I just think to me what he said, from what I see, what like he did call out those guys, he did say it was like disgusting, but what people were upset about it that he said there were bad people on both sides.

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       What did you ever see a storm fronts reaction to trump speech that he never criticized white supremacy and they were saying it was very good, very positive overall, and he said that there was problems on both sides and bad people on both sides. I see videos slide that Antifa was bad also and they were say, God bless Donald Trump. Okay, so this is what I saw from the videos that I saw because I have learned and we could go through this forever, that I don't trust the mainstream media at all. They're completely full of shit. So whoever rotated by corrupt people, a reporter. Sure. No, I'm not saying that it's necessarily corrupt, but been an embedded reporter that just wanted to write a story. Maybe maybe, but I'm from the videos that I saw like videos of what was going on there. It's like, yeah, I saw all the stuff you're talking about, like the Tiki torches.

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       The Jews will not replace us, swastikas, all that really, you know, garbage. And then I also saw, um, like David Duke and Richard Spencer and all these guys who are kind of like Richard Spencer, I think as a white nationalist. David Duke has been around forever. You know, is, is a bigoted guy who had a almost successful run for governor I think at one point in Louisiana. But you know, it's been around forever now. I find a lot of both of their ideas a fucked up at offensive, but they got a permit and we're there to speak and this was the next day. This has nothing to do the night before they were out doing all that crazy shit that we were talking about. And then I did see this video of groups of people who were forced out when they canceled the speech, a forced out through an Antifa mob at a bunch of them getting tear gassed and rocks thrown at them and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       So I don't know, I mean as, as, as disgusting as like white supremacy may be, or national socialism, particularly to me, someone whose family was fucking slaughtered by them. And I believe in freedom of speech and I think like the. So I do think to some degree I get, I just get where and, and like I get where trump is being. I guess what I'm sympathetic to is that he's being like a raked over the coals for not for calling out both sides instead of just calling out one side. Whereas everyone on the left is silent about this antifa group. It just started getting press actually covered in a fair way in the mainstream media. But it's everywhere but blow.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       I think the idea of anti for though is to react to people they disagree with who are speaking right? This is, this is their idea versus the idea of rights of premesis to walk down the street and denounce other weaker races and get together as a big group with torches and then people protest them and then there's violence. I think you got to address the root of the idea of it as a representative of all the people in the United States. The root of the idea of it is that it's okay to be a white racist and you know, there's a lot of people that said, what about Brown pride? How cain Velasquez is brown product tattooed on his fucking chest. If you don't know the difference between a guy who is born of immigrants that literally his dad walked from Mexico, you know, I mean this is, he's a first generation.

Speaker 2:          00:42:19       I mean, you're second generation. I guess his dad was first generation. How does it work? No, he's first generation American because his dad was from Mexico. I mean this is a, it's a different. I mean, they came here to try to get a better life because they got a shit roll the dice. They were born in Mexico and he wanted out and he wanted better for his family, so they took a chance to come here when he has brown pride tattooed on his. He's not saying that like, you know they're going to dominate and the Jews will not replace us. He's saying, I'm proud to be a Mexican. It sure when you say you're proud to be a Mexican for whatever reason, and I don't know why, it doesn't mean you hate white people. It doesn't mean you hate black people. It means you have pride in your heritage when you have white pride in for whatever reason.

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       I don't know why, but our thought is that you hate other races. Like if you are, if you're a white nationalists like you love white people, people look at you like you're a piece of shit and you are racist and you. You think black people are inferior and you think Mexican people and Asian people and American Indians, you think they're all inferior. That's how we look at it. But if you have black pride, we look at you as a strong person who's resisting this really fucked up society that has brought your ancient ancestors over from Africa and enslaved people and literally marginalized everyone who looks like you and you were there to fight against that. But it's kind of strange in a way, like even as you say it, it's kind of strange that we think of one this way and the other that way. I do think like, I get that, I, I get the certainly get the point that like came to Alaska, is tattooing brown pride on his skin, give him his story is a very different thing.

Speaker 2:          00:43:56       Then tattooing white pride on your skin because you're like a neo Nazi or something like that. And it was the UFC heavyweight champion and it never came up. Yeah. He's arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight in history. It only, it only came up in the, in the fact that like they were like, oh, we're gonna sell numbers in Mexico City. Brown pride. And they didn't. He lost the belt. Well, he shouldn't have used Brown. It's a fucking English word. People to say, no, you can't even. What is the, what's the word? Brown and Spanish. What's the word? Pride in Spanish. I get a guarantee you it ain't brown pride. If you go over there and you go, I got brown pride. They'd go, what? What'd you say?

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       So weirdly symbolizes how American he is. Ah, or our own. That's how you said that's what it should say. That's what she'd say came. Who? Fuck cane. I can't wait to see that guy fighting. I hope he can heal up. Yeah. He's had a lot of injuries or injuries? Yeah, just his whole career. Is that a lot of injuries but he's been yet, like you said, maybe the best heavy weight ever, but I just wanted to, to what you were saying like I do, I get that. I get the difference and I think that's a very, very valid point. But like there is this thing like the idea of white people embracing identity politics. The way the left has kind of embraced identity politics. Oh, it does in some sick way. Seemed like the natural logical progression. If you want to accept what the left wing believes and then you're like, okay, well you look at the demographics, white people are becoming a minority in this country in the future and this is how you kind of have like I get the point you're making, but at the same time it's a bit of a weird setup that the left has.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       We're like, everyone else is allowed to say these things except white people ever. Like political correctness kind of only applies to this one group and we're going to put everything you say under a fine tooth comb, but somebody else could say whatever they want. It gets to a cartoonish point where you have ice cube lecturing Bill Maher about making a joke and actually ironically while he's promoting his gangster rap album, sitting there going, now what made you think it was cool to say that Bill Maher and it's like motherfucker, you made cop killer. Yeah, she iced tea. Oh No, what? What was his song now? I'm sorry. They both didn't like cops is my point, but I'm just saying like he makes, you know. It's really funny. It's key calls, easy e a house Nigga on that album, right? He uses the same insults actually toward another black guy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       Not as a joke, not as a self deprecating joke the way Bill Maher used that, but in the worst way you could insult another black guy. He uses it, so I just think there is this weird dynamic on the left where it's like the rhetoric is so anti white and so anti male that I almost sit there and I go like, man, if you guys think Charlottesville is ugly, you're gonna. You're gonna. Create a lot more of this. I was sitting at my sister's place a couple of weeks ago and talking with a few of her left wing professors and my sister's got a. she's a college professor. He's got this big bookshelf up behind the, you know, like behind the table, lots of books and I just looked over and there was a Michael Moore book from the nineties called stupid white men and you just look at it and you're like, oh yeah, maybe that's why they're all angry. People don't like being the bad guy. Black Guy wrote a book called stupid black men. They would come out of him so hard. Yeah. It's sounds like something Larry elder my right, but with a more eloquent title for it. Nobody fuck with some stupid black man. If a black guy wrote a book that was like, Ah, you know, all white people aren't stupid. They'd be like uncle Tom, you know, like right away it's like, oh, you sell out. Well it's racist. Yeah. We just don't like to think it's racist because it's about

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       white people and generally white people don't have to deal with racism nearly as much as other races. So we allow it to be okay. It's also sexist. There a big thing that's going on now, especially lately where women think it's okay to say all white CIS men are trash. I mean, it's so fucking common. It is such a crazy generalization to say that all men or all white men are terrible and they're horrible trash until prove until they prove otherwise. And it's so fucking killer to say that it's so contradicts everything they've supposedly believed in it. So like, you know, if, if there's, uh, if there's like a Muslim terrorist event and then somebody lumps that into like radical lumps that into all Muslims, people on the left will lose their mind. Like how can you lump every, the whole group in with what this one bad guy did and then they turn the land and lecture white people about the evils of history.

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       But forget if we just stopped saying left and right, don't you think that what this is is just human beings doing that team thing, you know? And once you start adopting the rules and the patterns of the team, whether you're a Wisconsin cheese hat or you're a Boston red sox fan or whatever the fuck it is that you're into, you get into this like you've ever heard those vikings chant, whether they get the whole stadium like a thousand people and they clapped her hands together. It's insane. It's amazing. It's amazing, right? But obviously that is a group think sort of a situation. And they all, they all gear together and they all support this behavior that makes them feel good that they're a part of this group. And I think people do that when whenever they support rightwing causes and I think people do that whenever they support left wing causes and what the right and the left arm is essentially just frameworks that we can fit in our ideologies and our mind and our needs and all of our social and emotional requirements and we can fit them into these patterns that we follow and when anybody opposes the structure that we've adopted as reality, then we fight with bike locks and fucking pepper spraying girls with trump hats on.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       And you know, you find all sorts of insane justifications for racism, sexism, all sorts of crazy shit that you would if it were happening to anyone else other than the person that you're opposing. You would say, think of it as being a horrible front to everything that you stand for. But as long as it's a white man who cares? Hit him in the head with a bike lock. Imagine if it was a black woman that it was this professor was disagreeing with and he stepped up and he hit her in the head with a bike lock. It's insane. Like that's when, when you see someone who does that from Antifa, it is exactly the same as that. That redneck who pulls out his gun and shoots at that black guy was holding a torch. Yeah. Yeah. This is all the same thing. Well, I also know, I mean, you're right, and it's, it's like, uh, they're shocking similarities between, between the extreme and the extreme, right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       Or, you know, whatever. You know, these teams, and I agree with you completely. I think it's all just this tribal team group think bullshit kind of that we have to a large degree outgrown, but that's still kind of haunts us and it's still don't think they've outgrown and universities and that's part of the issue. That's why this is all happening at UC Berkeley. That's why you're seeing it all throughout the country in these universities because in universities, first of all, you have a bunch of people. Let's, let's try to be as honest and objective as possible. First of all, you have a bunch of people that are seeking knowledge. You have young people that are idealistic, that want to change the world, that want to stand out as being better. They want to virtue signal. They want to do all the crazy things that they can to be something great and there's other ones that want to get laid and there's other ones that want to manipulate and they still don't know who they are.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       They still don't know how to behave. Then you have these professors and a lot of these professors went through this process and then after they went through this process, they got their phd, they wrote and then they started teaching and so they have never been outside the hallowed halls of academia since the time they were like 19 years. They've been going through the whole system and some of them do it and they do it with balance and they figure out who they are and they take great pride in the fact that they can mold these young minds and give them information. And some of them are incredibly broken people who are never sexually viable when they were young and now they're in a position of power and they virtue signal to a sickening degree and you see them and you see them standing up for women above all else, which is what happened with this whole betsy devos thing when she's there.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       They're trying to push this and say her name devoss. I think they're trying to push due process in the case of these sexual assault cases on campus and people are resisting due process. People are resisting guilty until proven innocent. Oh my God, that's what they want. And I'm sorry, like, and I don't mean to also like uh, you know, like keep harping on this kind of left versus right thing. But it's hard for me. I almost want like some term to like define, but this left side of a lake on college campuses. This grill, they're position is simultaneously. I mean, it's really quite amazing. Their position is that, and this is what basically what was just repealed now, but this is what the guidelines under Obama basically did on college campuses. They said, okay, there's no due process for men who are accused of rape.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Oh, and by the way, and this isn't in the legislation, this is just the cultural punch, but so there's no due process for men accused of rape and by the way, everything is rape. Everything's right. Everything's right. Everything. Every guy you've ever met. Yeah, I mean if you had anything to drink, by the way, the man is not, is not responsible or the man is responsible. The woman is not so great beers. I mean you've probably taken 90 percent at least of the pool of what men and women in America previously considered. Good guys. Forget even like rapists, good men like just the guys who you think are good people not like consider it. Ninety percent of them are serial rapists. Have you heard the story from University of Amherst? It's one of the most ridiculous ones or this guy suing now and he has gone through hell for the last couple of years, but it was a kid who was a student from Nigeria and some girl who was in his class and they hooked up and they got together and they apparently they were slightly intoxicated, I think on marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       The girl gave the guy a blow job and then she wanted to stop and he was trying to get her to do it again and she said no. And so they ended it. That was it. Um, she talked to her friends. They decided that she had been sexually assaulted because he was trying to get her to. Come on, please, you know, I don't know what he said. I don't know, maybe it would be a no, that wouldn't be enough. I don't know what the fuck he said. I don't know what the scenario was, but I do know that it was essentially an awkward sexual exchange between young people, which is just a part of being a young person who's having sex. When you're, you're a person and you're 18 years old or whatever they were and you're in college and you're having sex and you're in some sort of a sexual scenario with a new person.

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       What are they? How long have you been doing that? Three years. How good are you at it or you fight you probably fucking terrible at it. You'd probably awkward as Shit. You probably weird around women. You can't believe they like you don't know why they like you. Maybe you're confused. Maybe you think you have to act a certain way. You know the, the finding yourself, you adolescent use it before you actually do not have a fully developed brain and it's a different and forget even insects and stuff like that. There's just things. How many things did you do at 20? We'd look back and go, oh, what a douchey thing to do. Like that's not how you treat someone. You know, like, so this young guy, I think he was 19 at the time, somewhere in the college age, whatever it was, he's fucked. They kicked him out of school, they labeled him some sort of a sexual Predator and he's in this terrible position where, you know, he's suing the school, but it's gonna take a long time before anything gets resolved and you know, we don't know the whole story of the case, but if the case is as he's representing it and as no one's said, he held her down, no one said he tried to rape her and no one said he threatened violence.

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       No one said anything like that. Her version of the story is that they had some sort of a willing sexual encounter and she just didn't want to go any further and he asked her to and she said no, and then it ended. That's it. That is a normal. That's just part of being a young person that's just part of being a young person having sex, especially if you're intoxicated. Is it a good idea to have sex intoxicated kid? I don't know. I mean, I've done it a bunch and sure you have to have. Yes. Stop pretending you haven't done it. Stop pretending that a lot. Look, there's all sorts of mistakes you make when you're drunk. W why? Why are they so much bigger? If it's sex and there's something about just using the word rape, rape. I mean it's like look, rape is a particularly horrific cutting word because of what a horrific crime it is and then to try to make everything else like it's literally, I mean the extent they go, it's almost like, you know, it's like if you, if you punch someone in the arm and they go, you committed or murder or something like that, it's like, no, you can't.

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       You can't just throw that word at everything. I mean everybody wants to. It's worse than that because of race. That's an assault is an actual egregious offense. If you're talking about people

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       having sex. No Cross, right? You're absolutely calling. You know, it'd be like calling a glance murder. Yeah. I mean it's really, it's fucking crazy. Was the idea of microaggressions and this is the whole. This is the whole thing that underpins the philosophy, which I find really terrifying is that the idea of micro aggression or social justice, it's like you take these terms like aggression or justice that meant something and now you've made the mean the opposite of what they mean. But microaggression is not an aggression inherently. It's not an aggression. No, I know. It's a normal part of human communication. You say something mean and I go like this and I walk away. That's what people do is that's a microaggression and there's this thing, and this is why I find it to be such that the issue of our time, I almost forget like, you know, like it's not the issue.

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       I necessarily wanted to be the issue of our time. I was hoping it would be like embracing libertarianism full on or something, but it just seems to be like, are you for free speech or against free speech and free speech has such a Prereq for everything. It's a prerequisite for everything about the, uh, the society we live in and everything particularly like what you do, what I do, everything we do. Like you can't, you can't. What I love in life is like comedy and truth and you can't have either of those without that free speech because possible can have this conversation about free speech. I mean, we couldn't have this conversation if we were on a state sponsored program. We couldn't have this. If we were on a corporate sponsored program, we'd likely couldn't have this conversation without being interrupted or, or being lectured to or having some conversation with someone who says, Hey, you can't say the word nigger.

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       Right? You're not allowed to say it. Forget about living in the context. Yeah, yeah. You can say that noise with your mouth. Right? Not Calling someone at not saying you are one, you know, and like, no one can go, but that's fucking retarded. It's what's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but that this was the rule and this is how everybody operates and there's a thing where it's not. I mean, if, if we're living in a world of I can't commit a microaggression, I can't go down a path that might offend anybody. You, you need that freedom in order to find anything interesting. There's nothing worth saying if you're living in this world where you're like, oh, I can't get outside of this box. So I find that to be very, just very dangerous and I feel like people in America, it's almost like we've had it too good for too long, that people are removed from the fact that we can lose all this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       It's like there's no, there's no respect for like, like what we have, how much different, how much higher standard of living we live than the vast, you know, uh, for, for, than most humans that are alive today. And the vast majority of humans who have ever existed. I mean, it's like what? I got this from a Jordan Peterson lecture, uh, but he said, uh, it was an 18, 95. The average American lived on a dollar a day adjusted for modern inflation. So in 18, 95, you know, it's like, like central Asia level poverty in America and that's just everyone. Before that living in backbreaking poverty was like, just life. That was just all of life. And it's like we figured something out in these last less than 200 years, you know, like we figured something or a little more than 200 years. We've figured something out. Wait, what am I saying?

Speaker 3:          00:59:27       No, no, no, it's less than 200 years. We figured something out in this industrial revolution that like now lets us live up here on this. And it's like we can lose that and a lot of it has to do with freedom. But the whole thing to me is freedom. The whole thing is that we embrace. Look, if you look in the year, um, and uh, that you had on your show, Thaddeus Russell, who's great, I just did his podcast recently and he put it this way, uh, where he goes, you know, in the year 1800 [inaudible] I was talking about what an incredible thing the 19th century was and how it transformed humanity. And he goes to the year 1800 Americans are all making their own clothes in the year. 1,900 Americans are shopping at macy's. Like we, we, if you had said in the, you know, in the year 18, 45 and been like, dude, in the next 65 years, slavery is going to be abolished in the West and we're going to have an industrial revolution, you know, it's like magic happen and that's why we live the way we live today.

Speaker 3:          01:00:19       And no one is even interested in that story. Like why do we have this much wealth? And I like what you said. I think it's, it's all about freedom. And when you have a guy like Bernie Sanders who harps on and on about income inequality, I, I have a real issue with that because it's one of those blanket statements. It sounds really good at a campaign speech, but freedom itself breeds income inequality. Yes. Because freedom means you can do whatever you want. You could do very little or you could work like a maniac. Well, if you're going to work, like if you're, if here's the game, okay, you do something for that. Something. You get currency, you use that currency to buy things or to make sure you don't have to work again by food and goods and take trips and travel. The more you work, the more you decide you want to pursue something, the more chances you have to acquire their currency.

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       If you do it correctly. That is income inequality due to freedom. I mean take away all the other factors that might be in play, whether it's racial discrimination or sexual discrimination. I'm not denying that those things exist, but what I am saying is that the idea that you are going to have income equality in a capitalist society where anybody can do whatever they want. You know people that is so counter to what we know about human behavior. I agree. This is. You're talking about a fantasy person who doesn't exist, who has motivations outside of wealth. Outside of that, most people want some sort of reward for what they do and if everybody gets the same amount, there's no fucking reward for working extra hard and that's not going to. We're not going to get Microsoft. You're not going to get IBM. It's just, I mean it's not, it's not just, I mean they talk about fairness a lot, which is a strange concept, but it's not just that somebody works twice as hard and doesn't get more.

Speaker 3:          01:02:03       I mean that's not the right thing to do anyway. But like what you were saying, I just think it's like they, they use the term so much, but what's misleading about it? You're absolutely right that freedom breeds inequality, but what's misleading about it is by that people think like the poor get poorer and that is objective. That is a like objectively false, demonstrably false. It's not that, you know, they make it out like the rich get richer and the poor get poorer like that old saying, but it's like that, you know, if you think it through like that can't really continue like that. Nobody was going to have rich. But if the poor work hard and figured they haven't possibility to escape whatever economic situation they're in, it is possible. But with freedom and homeless people here live better than, than rich people in Third World countries, or certainly at least better than average people in third world countries.

Speaker 3:          01:02:48       Uh, so it's like, it's not just that the inequality grows, it's like everything moves up. The inequality grows up here. And this is like what I just, what I can't understand. And, and again, it's like what I was saying before, like if you have any concept of the fact that we're by far the richest freest human beings who have ever existed in recorded human history, at least recorded human history. Who knows what is going on in ancient Egypt, but like a pro before engineered it. But, uh, but if you realize that we have this incredible amount, then it's like, yeah, it's like just being like, oh, we need all of these policies to like give handouts to poor people. It's like, well actually, let's continue this train of getting richer and richer and richer, which is not at all. You know what people like Bernie Sanders, man.

Speaker 3:          01:03:30       It's like, well, it's a hustle. Bernie's got a hustle going on. So you find out it's a hustle when you find out it's got a bunch of houses and his wife tried to buy up all this fucking land to expand the university that she was running and she killed the whole fucking school. Like you. How about the fact that the motherfucker, and we haven't seen. First off he, he made a million dollars off a book on how it's wrong to be a millionaire. I mean it's like how are you not how can anyone look at you like as a serious leader when you did that? So you saying what people want to hear and there is something, some truth to some of the things that he's saying. I think that the world would be a better place if we had more social programs in place. I think the world be a better place if college were free.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       If we think. I mean I don't disagree with like the thought behind that. I think they're, all of these things would be better suited in voluntary arrangements than some forced government monopoly. But I do agree with you that like, sure, I'd like great schools to be very affordable or free if possible. I'd like everyone to be. And, and Bernie Sanders certainly addressed some very real problems. Like he would point things out that were very real, like he would be like, you know, they claim it's a great recovery, but you know, 90 percent of the new wealth has gone to the top three percent, you know, like he either have some Jackie Mason, I only do one thing, two and that has to apply to every New York Jew who's out there. But like so like there is some, and I don't care if Bernie Sanders makes a million dollars, but there's something like, number one, making a million dollars while claiming it's kind of a moral issue that some people have so much what others have. So little endorsing Hillary Clinton. I mean, I just don't know how you can have. You can look at the guy who goes, the problem is incoming inequality and these and the banking cartel, but I'm going to vote for the candidate of the big banks. Like to me, that's, that's insane. It would, to me it would be if Ron Paul endorsed mccain. Well, don't you think the big banks sort

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       of were on both teams? Yeah. Well not. I don't know if they were on trump's team, but there's certainly been on every other team now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, certainly. It's not even like the teams they run the Treasury Department in the Federal Reserve. They run the whole system. But the fact that Bernie Sanders never had like a fiery speech about what happened at the DNC about how they literally conspired to ruin him and to take him out of the race with Hillary because they, the DNC wanted hillary to be the candidate. They literally sabotaged him. Oh, they were very open. I mean, I shouldn't say they were very open about that. Openly. They lied and said, we don't have a pick, but the leaks that were weaponized. Yeah. I mean really some of Russia did it. Russia ruined everything. I, I actually remember it was one of the most surreal and I'm a guy who was always preaching about how full of shit the media is, but even I like this last year that'll give the trump moment credit even I've been like, Holy Shit, I can't believe it, but I was watching CNN and they had.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       They were playing clips from a Hillary Clinton interview and talking about it and Hillary Clinton was claiming that Vladimir Putin a weaponized information against Hillary Clinton and they're discussing this and they never mentioned that the information is on CNN. They're breaking down this piece and they never mentioned that. The information that was weaponized was that CNN leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton before the debate. Like you sit here talking about undermining democracy for a month. What could be more to under what could do more to undermine democracy? The debate, the things that people actually watch and vote on in America. They gave Hillary Clinton the questions that were asked at the debate. We know for a fact too, I'm sure there were more, but we know two questions were given to her and that they were both asked and Hillary Clinton take some doesn't have a problem, doesn't have a moral issue with that, just takes them and pretends she's hearing the questions for the first time and the show that I'm watching describe.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       Talk about this on CNN that's talking about the weaponized information and not mentioning what the information was. The show is called reliable sources. It's a show where they break down the media. It's like it's surreal to be watching and then those same guys in CNN go, we've got an epidemic of fake news on the Internet and you're like, man, I don't know if I'm living through a fucking simulation or what, but this is some nutty shit. Well, it's so obvious when you watch the strategies play out. Like for people who don't remember Hillary Clinton before she ran against trump was running against Barack Obama. Yes. And when she was running against Barack Obama, one of the things she did was she positioned herself as to be right of center. So more right than Obama was. So one of the things that she did was she was publicly stating that gay marriage was wrong. She was publicly stated that she believes that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. And that was her way of positioning herself to the right of Obama. Like she would appeal to all the religious nuts. Obama, by the way, I'm okay with going left. I don't want no more war

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       in Iraq, but these fags marrying each other and. But fucking. It's just me and Gary Been Married for 25 years. You think it's right that they get to be the same thing? We are under Christ. She will. She will. Just to be fair, that Obama was also against gay marriage and that election, but she absolutely, you're right. Did he say how he. He did the same thing. It was these motherfuckers. It's like 51 percent approval rating, right? Then all of a sudden they come to Jesus 53. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, well, it's like right when it went right when it starts being a wedge issue we can use right when Obama was going, oh, we need reelection and I didn't end in any of these wars and still open. It's like if you're a comic, but the only way you could work is if somebody gave you an earpiece and they fed you great lines.

Speaker 2:          01:08:59       Like you couldn't just ad Lib Yourself. Like if you were doing this podcast and why you're doing this podcast, big Jay's over in the corner feeding you lines through one of your earpieces right. Know there's a team of guys, you know, because the other guys in the back, they're doing like a. they're like running like research on it. The like Jamie's over there constantly googling and you have like a screen in front of you. Like you know Howard stern used to have that with Jackie. The joke, man, this is way back in the day. Really? The jokes? Yeah. What he did was he had a thing where you would write on like an overhead projector. This was like a thing. It was like a camera and he would see the video of it on his side. He would see the picture. So you had a funny line, you would write down the funny line and you would put it on the projector and Howard would get it on his screen and that's one of the things that Jackie, the joke man did because he was always.

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       He was great at like one liners and things along those lines. He knew a lot of jokes and so he would give Howard like really funny things to say any with juice it up and I did the Jackie Chair for a couple times when Jackie, the joke man quit. Jackie wanted like a million dollars a year and they wouldn't give him a million dollars a year. They would give them a 900,000. He was like fuck you. So he left and so when he left they had a bunch of guys sit in that chair and one of them was already and already wound up taking that job and part of our job was to feed Howard lines and like that kid Benji. He's really funny man. That guy, he would write down stuff and feed Howard funny lines, so he has a few guys on the side that would toss some stuff, which is essentially what a politician does, write us a politician like you're not going to get their full unadulterated ideas except for trump and that's one of the things that was so refreshing about, even though it was a shitty message, even though there's a poverty of words and the way he spoke and there was this clunkiness to it all.

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       There's certainly as a clunkiness, there's no question about that. It's a very, very simplistic way of, of speaking compared to what we're used to. Politicians. Yeah, like all the slogans, slogans, work. I think there is something about it. The fact that he was as, as you were saying, like completely unrestrained, completely on, you know, there's something really interesting about trump. I mean the whole thing is really fascinating, but it, it's like the most profoundly hilarious and interesting moment ever. And like no one wants to appreciate

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       it because they're so dug into like one or the other. Nuclear War with Korea. Well, I get that. That's kind of scary. I mean it's more, more scary for the people in Seoul than us, but still like that is scary. But the thing with trump is that he speaks and, you know, it's like, okay, the people who hate trump hate him more than any. Anyone. I mean, I've never seen a political leader hated as much as the people who hate trump hate him right now. No one in America for sure. No, no, no one in my lifetime has in America has even come close. I'm sure there are other countries where it's like, you know, dictator. Yeah. Yeah. Like that I'm sure. But like there, um, but trump has hated and I got to be honest with if you ask people on the left why they hate him, I think they struggled to give you a really good, honest answer for it. I mean they'll say things like, I think they say things like racism or bigotry or you know, I'd say pa people were paying attention to what he's doing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:08       Right. They were worried about that. Although I gotta say the EPA thing, I don't think any of this is actually the source of the trump patriot. I think this is like we hate trump and now what's he doing? That's how we're going to get evidence against him. Um, the truth is what they'll say nine out of 10 times if I present this to a left wing person or I'll go like, oh, you know, he's pretty much continuing all the Obama policies or it's virtually the same. Which I think is one of the really big stories of the trump era so far that how much is the same since Obama. No one wants to talk about big changes. There's been a big change. I'm not saying there are no changes. Immigration Policy, immigration policy. He wrote one executive order by the courts, but it hasn't really gone into effect, but it's the idea that he's promoting his rhetoric is very, very different.

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       No question about that. He's promotes different ideas. His rhetoric is very, very different. Um, but in terms of like monetary policy, fiscal policy, foreign policy, the war on drugs, see if you're talking about immigration, I mean, that's kind of like, okay, I would get, I'm putting that in domestic policy in my mind, but yet far enough, well in foreign policy it speaking about, because I was saying nine out of 10 times the answer to me as they go, well, that's kind of your white privilege. And if you were in, if you were in one of these, uh, um, uh, uh, groups that's worried about being deported, you would feel differently. But the fact is that deportations are down, right? Under trump, there were more under Obama. I mean, they're down now. There's a few different arguments for why that reason is, uh, there have been a lot of arrests but, but not deportations, but it's just like, even that the narrative isn't fitting the way.

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       Like what really, to me, what really drove what made people hate trump was his rhetoric. It was all rhetoric. It wasn't. Obama was deporting lots of people. Obama was bombing the crap out of him. Obama was targeting families of, of and he was torturing like all these things were happening, but he didn't talk about it. He spoke about it in a nice way and trump was like this unapologetic like white rich man who didn't play the PC game and spoke of minorities. Not In like a glowing. I'm so sorry, like minorities are better than me. I'm the evil white guy. Was like, no, we're

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       great. I never say we're great. He would say, you know, some nice things about minorities when asked, but his central message was like our teams great and this to me is I think the reason why leftwing people's blood boil was just so many pieces of evidence that point to corruption with Russia. So many pieces of evidence that point to the idea that this guy is operating in the interest of himself and of big business and then he's profiting in a huge way off being the president and one of the ways they're doing that. The reason they're not rolling back the environmental protection agency standards because they don't believe in them. They're rolling a backpack because it's impeding business. That's infuriating. A lot of people on the west scares the shit out of people when you have some crazy old man who's just doing everything for profit.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       Some guy who wants to literally start disc fights with basketball players and the hosts from. That was the thing. We talked about this before, but the host from espn who had tweeted some stuff about him being a white supremacist and then he asked for espn to apologize. I'm like, hey, how come you didn't talk about her man? He can't talk about her. He can't. They literally can't say her name because if he goes after a black woman, then it reinforces all these people's ideas. Prejudice might know. Look, I, I get what you're saying and just to the point about corruption. I mean like, of course. I mean that's the nature of government. Like whatever decision they're making is based on what lobbyists is lobbying them the harder and when it's all corrupt, but my point is just that, that is not at all different with trump.

Speaker 1:          01:15:41       I mean like if you like the corruption under Obama was. I mean, Obama just went and collected $400,000 for a speech to a Wall Street, so he's in there just a couple of months ago, right? Don't they all do that and once they get out, bomb is like you're in there, you preside over the bailouts of the banks. Started under Bush, but continued under Obama and the big ones, the Fed policy, which really bailed them out. Like you're in there. You take all this money for your campaigns, you present, you vote every way that they want you to. You preside over the biggest profits for the big bankers. You put them all around your administration and he'd get out and you collect your check. It's like time to get rich now. Now some of them one check, he's going to get a ton of them. As you think it's speaking everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:16:24       I mean, maybe I'm wrong, right? I'm being too cynical. Probably all of those bankers just really loved the way Obama speaks. He's, I mean, he has a great speaker, but here's my problem. That's not why they're paying them. Hillary Clinton is not a great speaker and they paid her shit tons of money and that was one of the things that Bernie said, we're the transcripts and you know, what a transcript. And of course, uh, she didn't, but wikileaks did get their hands on one of them in which she said something that kind of indicated why she didn't release the transcripts because she actually said I'm lying to the public. I mean, not literally, but she basically said to all these bankers to not be concerned about because, you know, she hurt public rhetoric at the time was like, you know, no one's too big to fail, no banker too big to jail. And then she basically said to them in this speech that wikileaks leak to the transcript of where she was like, you know, you have to take one public and then hold

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       a different position in private. So she was basically assuring know that that's an unaltered now. I mean it's kind of like the same way that we, we know that all of the emails are legit, like they've been presented. Even the Clintons aren't arguing that there are legitimate. Like nobody's really coming out and arguing that they're not legitimate and it, and it seems too big from a legitimate site. Julian assange is sort of shifting over time, paying more and more aggressive, like his, his position on things. He's more, he's more aggressive, more leaning one way. I think he's bummed out that he's still stuck over there. I mean, it's rotting him away. Sure. But I think he's been kind of consistent. It's almost like everybody else, like changing their of like I feel like the Democrats to me and the people who follow them and the trump haters, it's like insane how much they've changed their possessions.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       Like to me, Julian assange was exposing all this bullshit under Bush. He exposes all the shit about Clinton and Obama. And it was like, yeah, from my perspective, they're all part of the same network. So he's kind of exposing the same network. Whereas the Democrats became cold warriors, like, like the Democrats. As soon as trump got in, it's like, well, everything was CIA is taken without any evidence being project, uh, presented. And Russia is the evil threat of our time. And like when did you go, you guys became Republicans from the seventies, like just that quickly and then every. I even saw somebody today, like it's like the trump haters, like again, feel however you feel about trump hatim sure. Go ahead and be against. I, like I said, I think it's terrible that he's telling st people should be fired for speaking up. Like that's ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       But I say these guys who are like, they're like, oh, you want, you know, you want to talk about patriotism and, and like bashing trump for being a draft dodger. He wants. He dodged it a ton of. If you did whatever you did to stay out of the Vietnam War, God bless you. God bless you for staying away from that fucking nightmare. That was started on a lie. That was like the most disgusting mass slaughter for profit. I mean like if someone avoided that, like you're mad at him for avoiding going and killing some fucking poor people in Southeast Asia. But it's just the point that they could grab him on the hypocrisy of being a chicken hawk. Like same as Dick Cheney. They did it with him as well, but it's not because he is at, look, I'm all for hitting someone for hypocrisy, like if you're advocating a war, hitting them on not wanting to fight a war, but you're just mad at him for not being on the same side of yours about police brutality.

Speaker 3:          01:19:32       It's like finding out his character, pointing out who he is. Fine, but don't abandon all of your principle guy. He's not like JFK went over and fought in the war. I get what you're saying, but I don't think there's. I'm just saying if the left is going to say to me, it's kind of abandoning your own principles. If you're going to bash someone for like a not fighting in the Vietnam war, you kind of know what they're doing. They all do that. They try to find something that you did that's kind of questionable that they can politicize. Yes. No, I get it. I'm just making the same thing with like the Democrats becoming the Cold War. It's just like, yeah, so whatever windows, whatever gets you points. What really gets me with the Democrats with the left is how all of a sudden Julian size is a puppet

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       of Russia now, like for the longest time Wiki leaks was supposed to be the voice of honesty. This not, you know, non bipartisan sorta or bipartisan openminded group that's just trying to disseminate information they think is critical to the American people that they're being denied. Like the casual, would it called casualties? What was that one video that they had? There was a v, one of the first videos was, I forget what they called it, but they had a footage from one of those gunships when those helicopters and they showed these guys sort of casually talking about gunning down these reporters. They thought these reporters are carrying guns and so they just opened fire on them and gunned him down, including lunch.

Speaker 2:          01:20:58       I forget what it was called, I forget, but that sort of like they. They felt like they had some information that people weren't aware of. They weren't allowed to see photos of caskets. They weren't allowed to get the full. They weren't allowed to have a really informed opinion and what exactly is happening there and when they see the horrors of war in that regard, like we see people like sort of casually talking about gunning down some people and I think there are kids in their car and well they shouldn't have brought kids. You know, that was one of the things they had said. Like that whole thing was like, Whoa, we are better off knowing that this is what can happen if you just allow people to just go to war. And especially some really ambiguous war on terror. That's what wikileaks did for, right? Qliq stood for Chelsea Manning, AK Bradley Manning, you know, releasing this information. Someone who is under a lot of people's eyes, a patriot, right? A whistleblower. See something gets a hold of some stuff and it's like, look, you guys got to see this and gives it out to wikileaks, but try to give it out to other people. Right? Didn't, didn't he try or she tried to believe New York time?

Speaker 3:          01:22:01       I believe so I got rejected it and then out into the same thing. And then uh, you know, Chelsea Manning, Bradley manning at the time, paid quite a price for it, I think 200 days in solitary confinement. This is a really brutal price. Um, and yeah, and exposed a ton of really interesting stuff. I mean, we, what we learned from the Bradley Manning Dump, what's, you know, like all this crazy shit about war crimes and then like we learned about how there were like a, like US officials trying to influence the British parliament, trying to influence a reporters and just all that shady shit that came out. Um, and then again it becomes this kind of like integrity test for the mainstream media or they just have no interest in it. I mean, if they talk about it, they'll talk about Chelsea manning. But that's the story. The same snowden's the story. None of it's ever like, Oh shit, we learned some crazy shit that's going on. Well that's what we are. We're a nation of gossip, awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:22:57       Copper next historic, not Puerto Rico. You know, a guy not standing up with his hand in the correct position that lets know that we are

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       all on one mindset, that guy is more important and even within that context and a lot of people like and this is where there's this weird disconnect between like there's like the mainstream media and then all of the alternative Internet media and there's certainly a ton of bullshit in the alternative Internet media world and a lot of just straight up false stories short, but then there are people also talking about the truth there. Whereas none of that seems to enter the mainstream media. So what doesn't. What gets brought up online and in the alternative media, which should be at the center of this story, is that like, like the the players didn't use to be on the field for the national anthem. For the vast majority. It was 2009 or 2010. The Defense Department cuts these huge checks to the nfl and then all of a sudden they get the players out on the field so we can do this whole tribute thing.

Speaker 3:          01:23:50       And the military industrial complex has been like working on taking this past time, the number one sport in America, which is already pretty like warring and making sure we can use this as propaganda to get Americans, you know, into this nationalistic pro military mindset. I like no. Are you a journalist? Like how are you not interested in that? How is it, how can Obama sign into the national defense authorization act that he has the right to detain American citizens with no charges? And it's like, okay, like Alex Jones is over here. And like, yeah, I know he says some wild stuff, but he is making a big deal about this. Like this is crazy. And then the mainstream media just doesn't think it's a big story. How is it possible that you're a journalist in honest journalist with integrity and you don't think it's a big store?

Speaker 3:          01:24:34       You don't look at that and go, well that's the story of my lifetime. Obama just repealed habeas corpus. Don't you think it's the exact same thing as what we were talking about with people in academia and on the left, don't look at things that are in opposition to the group. Think of their ideology. I think it's, it's a lot of that and it's like this thing where it's like there's this, it's almost like unspoken, unwritten pressure where you just kinda know. It's like, right, you have this herd mentality and you know, if I step out here I get bashed and most people don't want to get bashed. Like, you know, you were talking about the people who are professors and and they're certainly very, very smart people. Lots of very, very smart people. But it is a certain personality type, you know? It's like that, that, that person who like that you go to school your whole life.

Speaker 3:          01:25:15       Then you go to college, then you go to Grad school, then you teach and you basically just been in college your whole life. Did you see that video? That woman at the Berkeley protests where she's screaming at the cops fucking yes. Yes. Screaming in the. Yes. See if you can find her, because that is a social retard. That's what she's asking them to go arrest people inside. They're Nazis and these are the types of people who never got into into like, look, there's socially retarded. I mean, that's really literally what it is. They never competed in the real world. They didn't formulate a normal psychological outlook. Yeah, but there's. Okay, so there's that, that woman who you're talking about and, and, and Oh yeah, she is whatever, whatever, the scientology, whatever the top level is. I'm saying that it's left wing level five. You've achieved the height of those people are literally mentally disturbed. People like these

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       are. Yeah, laser. This is a woman with video's gone. It impossible. Well, this one has to go to four Chan. So fine. If I don't believe those geniuses at four. Chan haven't kept this job, but this is, she's at level five with like trigger puff and those who like yelled out for more muscle Missouri state. These are like the maximum level and most of those people are made up of like genuinely disturbed people. Here she goes, here, can we get some volume on this crazy bitch?

Speaker 4:          01:27:09       Do you work for Devin?

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       Wasn't that at Milo's rally? Which is hilarious. I think this was Gavin. Could you say proud boys is getting your proud boys a boy. She might work for his marketing. That's like the best branding. She's still going. We shut it off, but she's still going. I'm a fucking professor. How dare you so much make a t shirt. From my perspective, I'm a fucking professor. How dare you. I've a professor is not what you expected. The next line's fucking professor. How dare you so well, but also from my perspective, like as a libertarian, you just look at that and you're like, wow, what a naked like example of you just calling the state, calling the authority of the state because you believe this ridiculous microaggressive aggression. Like, well, just look at her the way she's behaving and that's not a balance, but ilt person. What I was describing with the college professor, I wasn't talking about those people like that's level five disturbed is that top people will change you like belt in Jujitsu. That's. That's like, it's not even like that. Not even black belt. That's like next next level. Like you're tapped out. Yeah. You tap out black belts, coral and then red belt is like Noam Chomsky, red belt, right. Written Chomsky's, a red belt. Noam Chomsky is actually like an intellectual. I don't want to lump them in with these top of right. He, but he is talking to the top of the food chain, left wing ideologies, but this is like

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       some Hixon Gracie Shit, but these, these people, she's more retarded. She's more of a Kung Fu person. She's got ineffective martial arts. She's got some shit, some shit that doesn't even really work for work. She's trying to get people with that cheat. Touched was like a guy with like just an overhand right. Could probably take you if like you'd like to see her. Like in an MMA fight with Cyborg. She actually would believe that she had this. Cheese is still the most amazing. There's still to me, nothing better. I know you've got over a bunch of near Shell before, but there's nothing better to me than someone really believing in a martial art that doesn't work and finding out in a fight modular doesn't know. It was amazing through the early UFC is when it used to happen. It'll still, you'll find internet videos that have it, but it's still going on in 2016 and 17 has been some of the best videos ever, especially at China where they had that.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       One guy had to go into hiding. He brained some fucking poor slob that thought he knew Kung Fu. You know some dude really thought he was going to cheat, touch this guy, and he got he this Chinese kid who knows mma, fuck this guy up and had to go into hiding because so many people are mad at him for using martial arts techniques that did not originate in China to sort of denigrate Chinese martial arts, man. Yeah. Myth versus reality. What's interesting, they are fighting against the exposing of their bullshit nonsensical fucking tiger claws. Shit like. And you've got an entire identity associated with this being real me. And want the guy who did is also Chinese, so China is apparently like Asia in particular is where a lot of the martial arts techniques that people use today originated and they were sort of adapted and they were changed and they evolved particularly in Thailand.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       They really started understanding how to kick the legs and they became masters at using the elbows and the knees more so than and they did it through competition, which is really quite fascinating. They did it through gambling and by having these competitions on a regular basis where people will like nine, 10 years old, they start fighting and they fight. They might have hundreds and hundreds of fights in their career by the time they retire. They developed a real acute understanding of what actually works and what doesn't work. Whereas these other worlds, they didn't do that. They didn't have. They weren't like this small island is filled with hedonists that are gambling, kicking each other in the legs and betting on the guy kicking the guy. That's really what develop that art. But then there's other ones that sort of stayed in this non evolved state. And then as the material sort of got out to all of the world and people started to evolve into techniques, it all coalesced together in the ultimate fighting championship.

Speaker 2:          01:31:31       And then we realized, okay, it's a combination of these things doesn't necessarily always work on every individual and styles sort of straddles sort of determined interactions and athletes determined whether or not something is effective or ineffective as much as the technique itself, the athleticism and speed and power of the practitioner is very important, but all told these are the things that we think are pretty effective. These are the standard techniques. Yeah, the new information. But you figure out pretty quickly like, okay, like wrestling and you know, crane kicks are not the same thing. One guy used Western boxing techniques and Moy Tai and wrestling and Jujitsu and just beat the holy fuck or this poor. I mean did it like 10 seconds, beat the holy fuck out of this poor Kung Fu guy. And then he had to go into hiding. People didn't want to know. They didn't want to know this is white power, white power.

Speaker 2:          01:32:21       The white power guy goes in there and gets fucking merch by Anthony. Joshua Electric Shit. How is this possible? Well, of course it happened. Did you not know who you were? Do you not know who he is? You know you're, you're in denial of this. And so if they all came after Anthony Joshua, because he beat the shit out of the white power boxer. That's exactly what's going on in China. It's take watch it here. So get this guy who his poor fucking dog, you can just already tell he's got some crane technique going on and the kid just fuck and starts beating the shit out of them. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Just fucking pummel him. Unconscious knuckles to the temple. Literally it happens all the like 10, 15 seconds. His kid just kicks the shit out of him and then after this happens and this guy who doesn't get hit like he's, he's never been hit before.

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       You know what I mean? Like, yeah, he didn't get hit at all. He doesn't listen. He's not used to even like being in this situation, but he must've believed that it was going to work. He must've believed that he was capable of fending off attacks. I agent and he's doing that crazy shit. I'm trying to remember in mma, what was the guy, I can't remember his name was like some really, really Asian name, but the dude to fought Nick Diaz. You called the fight. It was like an old nickname aspect before he left the website and the guy tried this crazy technique. He tried like hands out here. I'm going to block your punches with punches. It was like a short Asian dude. Me and thinking of Tony Ferguson, I think. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's 100 percent a nickname called as cocoon. You called it and I remember you being there.

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       I remember you saying during the thing you were like you say before the fight you go, this is really weird. He was doing this stuff before, like in the octagon warmup and it comes out like doing it and you're like, okay, he's going to try to fight Nick Diaz with this weird stuff. Like where he's trying to, whatever it's doing like this kind of like, like style of trying to block by like hitting their hands with your hands. Way Out. Pull up. Nick Diaz is a record. I'm, I'm remembering. I'm Tony Ferguson fighting this guy who's a bad motherfucker and pride. And His name is cocooned. No. And he used to fight like that. Pull up Tony Ferguson's record me. See if he could find that video. Tony Ferguson versus cocoon. Yeah. It's not. I don't think it's he though of that fight. I don't remember. I don't remember. Tony Ferguson.

Speaker 2:          01:34:30       He's been around for awhile. Yeah, totally lit him up. So what it was was that cocoon was a guy that had this crazy kick that he would throw to the body and fuck a lot of people up with it. And it was kind of a hybrid between a front kick and a roundhouse kick. Like some people would call it a 45. Yeah. Cotsen, Nora cocoon. No. And He came out him. Yeah. I think that's the fight you're thinking of man. No, I'm telling you this guy pull up. Nick Diaz is one of the ideas. It's a different guy. I used to fight like this. He used to walk forward like this. The Guy I was like that it was a similar type of style, but the guy was saying, but it was like real short too and I mean Nick Diaz just, it was like the worst guy to fight with that style because he's got like real Chris boxing so he just came in.

Speaker 2:          01:35:13       I mean just lit them up like next to his last fight in his first run in the UFC. So it's up way before this. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. Down, down from. This is down before it's his first run in the UFC. So it's a real maybe before the losses. Gleason Josh right there. Right there. Before Diego Sanchez. That's it. Oh, that Guy Koji. Click on it. Cogent. No, there's no ass there. Oh yeah. Oh he, she is that he said, I think you're right. Koji. Oishi. Yeah, maybe. Oh, okay. Nick Diaz and I remember this kid, I remember saying this kid looks like he's on heroin. Like he walked in like, like almost like in a Zombie state as he walked into the octagon. It was really strange. Just click on that right there. That's me. This is a different. Is it neat? Yeah. And then this was in the UFC, but it's the vine of it.

Speaker 2:          01:36:11       Is there? I don't know. I guess they both thought, yeah, this is the fight I'm talking about. He's trying to do this openhanded weird thing and it's just. Oh Nick, just by eating them online. I mean, uh, I'm sure it's on the UFC. See if he could find Tony Ferguson versus cocoon. No, that's a weird one because cocoon. Oh, he had this weird style, like almost like a car, like you would think of as a guy who knows karate, like move forward, like standing like totally square, not sideways, like moving forward in this weird way. And he would throw this kick and it wasn't a front kick up the middle. It was like an angled front kick. So he hit you with the ball was foot, but you throw it like a roundhouse kick, which was one of the ways that they used to do that in the old taekwondo way too.

Speaker 2:          01:36:56       They would make impact with the ball of the foot with a roundhouse kick, like they would throw a kick. Like I got a book when I was a kid about taekwondo techniques and this one old dude would practice in the park by kicking trees and the way he would kick trees with the ball of his foot. He throw a roundhouse kick and kick the ball of his foot into the tree. And it was. It was really funny, but because in one, one of the things where you described all various self defense techniques, he described what to do if you ever threatened by someone and one thing you should do is kick a tree. So show them like if you kick a tree, what you could do to them. It's probably an actually bad advice. It's just to break your leg and then I'll just kick a tree.

Speaker 2:          01:37:34       You know what I'm saying? Like if, if you're not used to getting countries, see if you can back that up, CV, back it up. But that's, it's only a ten second view. Oh, okay. Cocoon was a, hey, this is also another one of those guys were go let that play. Play out. A little video you were just showing. He was one of those guys that was in a shit ton of fights. So see that was, that was back when he was competing and karate. I think that's Keoki. Yeah. Keoki Shin. And so they fought with yogesh and outfits on, but they had an MMA fight and the guy who was a, the referee was dressed up in a fucking weird sort of geisha outfit. Like what the fuck's that guy wearing? But cocoon. Oh, was a like sort of a classic Japanese martial arts. Stryker. That's, that's him right there.

Speaker 2:          01:38:21       Okay. And you got to think by the time these guys got to the UFC, they had been trained so many fucking times, especially fighting in pride and k one. Oh Shit. Boom. Front kick to the body. Right hand. That's a wrap. That was due. Dude is fucked. Check this out again, man. Watch how I do this. Just steps. It was a different fight. Aau Tournament probably, which is really crazy that these guys would do this more than one time a day, but that was what they did in pride a lot. Oh, he just threw them off the top of the Mat and pride. They would fight several times a day early UFC is as well and then it like eventually I think they started realizing like a lot of guys get injured doing this. The craziest ideas like that stupid movie warrior when they fought more than one time in a week, like they fought once and they fought again the next day.

Speaker 2:          01:39:12       That's got to be worse than the same day probably because you're like all the soreness that like comes in two days later. Your fucking face is all swollen. You can't say you have to have sunglasses everywhere. You definitely can't take a punch. Like the whole idea is so stupid and they don't do that. I mean maybe they've done that a couple of times throughout history, but that's not a standard thing in this movie warrior. They, they just added their own Hollywood judges to the suit, be like, let me just change it. You're going to fight for the flavor, and then the next day I'll grabbed my balls. That's what they did. They added their own stupidity to it just didn't even make any sense. And it was totally unnecessary like that. That's you can't, you're changing what martial arts are just to fit your narrative because you're not a good writer.

Speaker 2:          01:39:54       Like if you, if you were a good writer, you would write about how it actually happens and you'd make a story about how it actually happens. You wouldn't create some fake thing that you can do. So be several times in a day, twice, two days in a row you'd be fucking meat. Well, it's just give them super powers at this point. Just give him like guns and stuff. If you're listening to John Claude van Damme, you got to decide what you are. Are you, uh, an excellent dramatic movie with Nick Nolte and Tom, what the fuck's his name? Who was another guy? The fuck's his name? No, no, no, no. How dare you? The young guy who's a Bain, Tom Hardy, Tom Hardy, that motherfucker is amazing, right? It's him and Nick Nolte mean they're amazing, but yet they put it in this stupid plot idea where they have to fight in two days. Like, come on, just come on. It's like it's, it's annoying because it's like you're making this world real and then you're doing something that's just my little ridiculous. Yeah. World where I work, so it makes me buy like super offended. I'm super excited. It makes it impossible for someone like you to. Because it's like if anyone

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       who knows fighting Canada, which by the way I will say, and I do, even when we talk about old school, UFC, there's something like that. Like I'm nostalgic for it. I know you can't have it now. It has to be the sport it is now and it's evolved way past there, but there was just something so cool about the old ufc and there was something about the conor versus floyd fight that almost gave you that feeling again of like these two guys from different worlds going in there and like how does this look like? How does a guy who doing mma striking and fucking doing like capital Ada stuff on the side, how does he go in there and buck and that it turned out connor actually it was just like, oh no, you got a box, can't do any of that stuff. Get destroyed.

Speaker 1:          01:41:28       So I just went out there and boxed and. But it was an interesting. Like I came out of it. I was arguing with a lot of friends of mine were like big boxing fans, nothing against you guys. God bless boxing. I'm not like as big a fan as I used to bake. I'm a huge MMA fan, but I just can't. Like when you look at mma, the way you look at mma is like the sport of fighting and, and the original thing was always figuring out who's better at fighting and have these does. It was just hard for me to not look at the fight with conor and floyd and go like, you know, it's like when there was the first Clinton I, Louis j Gomez said this to me is the first clinch of the fight. He goes, well, that's where connor would destroy him. Yeah, and then you just sit there watching 10 rounds of of a referee, saving floyd mayweather's life.

Speaker 1:          01:42:10       Like every few seconds the referee comes in and goes, Oh, let me save your life. Don't let me save your life. I know you're the greatest effort this, but you need even under your rules with your gloves and your this, you need a ref to keep coming in and saving your life every few seconds and you'd see it like every time they they clenched. Like connor would immediately almost just instinctually just kind of take us back and like step over here because right here is where I can hit you and you can't hit. It would just cover up and bend over. Like literally bend over, guy come saved my life buddy. And it's just hard to not watch that and go, Oh, if he wanted to, he would jump on his back and choke them to death. And even in Europe, even in your sport, like he went 10 rounds and okay, I know mayweather.

Speaker 1:          01:42:49       I know what may, whether did was brilliant and he dragged him in, he played it safe and perfectly, but it wasn't a part of the plan to eat that upper cut on the chin that definitely wasn't a part of the planet. And, and also I think there's boxers punch a lot harder than MMA guys do and there's, there's truth to that too. So Connor's power didn't translate in the way that MMA fans thought it would, but he's just not quite as fluid. And also I think he was probably very nervous. I mean he's fighting literally the greatest fighter of all time and his first professional boxing match. It's so crazy. And yet he's still got it to the 10th round it flow. I mean, I, this is why I said I said I gave her a very small chance of winning a boxing match, very small. So I thought it was like 94 percent that floyd would beat the shit out of Canada the way he did. And the economy would eventually get tired. Like the guy who did the best assessment of it, uh, in my opinion was John, John Donahoe. John Danaher, who's a brilliant Jujitsu coach, is also brilliant mma coach because get a deep understanding of it. He basically spelled out exactly what's going to happen because of all the times he's seen a boxer's sparring with elite martial artists that the mixed martial

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       arts does well for a few rounds because it takes awhile for the box and to figure out the timing and then the efficiency and fluidity of the box. It starts to take over the ring generalship the understanding of this one isolated particular discipline and then they dominate and that's exactly what happened to a it. What I said is I think there's a 94 percent chance that floyd mayweather. It just boxes the shit out of conor Mcgregor. There is a four percent chance that connor catches him with like an apricot like it did in the first round and actually stuns them and hurts them and then swarms on him and takes him out. Connor has got ferocious power. It's whether or not he executed that power, like he has an mma, whether he felt he could drain his gas tank like that, especially with two months worth of training, not enough, not enough to get in shape for a 12 round boxing match against the greatest of all time, but there was a 100 percent chance that connor nukes him in a fucking mma fight.

Speaker 2:          01:44:43       Nukes him like I would be willing to literally 100 [inaudible] Floyd's not going to knock them out with one punch and Conecuh kick his fucking legs out from under him before we got even close enough to punch them. And if they did get to a clinch, which they absolutely would, connor would ragdoll him to the ground and beat his fucking brains in before he strangled him. One hundred percent, 100 percent. Even if you just look, if you just take out even grappling. I agree with you that I just thought as a master of range and he's got excellent kicks and if he can kick the shit out of him and stay out of the area where he's just stay out of his punching range and kick him in the legs and the body believed if he can clench, if you don't break them up. When he coaches, he show nice the body, they're done fucked.

Speaker 2:          01:45:20       You're fucked in elbows to the head. He's going to tie you up in the back of the head and smash you. Has that ever happened? No. He's never. You don't know what the fuck to do when a guy's doing that. You don't know how to deal with those needs. The face like when Anderson Silva fucked up rich Franklin to win the title when you just plumb the back of his head and just start smashing these in his face and he was clear that rich really didn't know. He didn't have an answer to that, which was an amazing thing because that was one of those moments like everyone in the mma world thought rich was the best or not mma world. Everyone in the UFC world kind of like what was the, because you're. That's why I correct myself because people who knew the MMA scene better and pride and that stuff knew what Anderson Silva was, but like the average fan of the UFC had just been.

Speaker 2:          01:45:58       We hadn't really seen Anderson Silva. I hadn't seen one or two tapes of pride and I would say I saw him like maybe not. It's on the one where you got ankle, ankle locked real quick because I didn't really know how good Anderson Silva was. I saw I'd seen him beat Carlos Newton and that was like all I had on them, so I was like, I have rich Franklin will probably. Well the third type is the pride fights. The thing was when he got out of pride and then fighting in a cage wars or cage warrior, what the fuck was that? English. I remember the one you're talking to the organization. I know that it's an English organization. God dammit. I want to say cage wars, but it's not that cage warrior the fuck do they call it? Anyway, he went over there and just started fucking people you can people.

Speaker 2:          01:46:36       So like I hadn't seen any of that, any of that, and I think, I guess most of UFC fans hadn't seen that either and they thought rich Franklin is the champ. Beat up a bunch of guys. The odds were actually I'm in innocence favor though. Oh, what are they? One of the weird ones where the odds makers, when he fought Chris Leben, he was a slight favorite looney his first UFC fight and I was like, get ready for some crazy shit because this motherfucker's on a totally different level. I'm like, I knew him. I'd seen him fight Jorge Rivera and Lee Marie. I saw him hit Tony Ferguson with a step in upper cut elbow that he had practice on a pillow at home. He made his wife hold a pillow and practice this technique because he wanted to use it in his fights in as coaches wouldn't hold the pads for them because they thought it was ridiculous and they said, is this true?

Speaker 2:          01:47:18       I think I remember hearing this, but I think it was like in between rounds. He said to one of his coaches, he goes, I think it's open. I think it's there. They were like, forget about this stupid technique. Dammit. Like, it's not going to be there. Uh, I don't know if that's the case. You were worried about that. Fucked up Tony Ferguson before that. The reason why I was able to get that off, it's because he wasn't turning 21st. Excuse me. I'm 20 Franklin. Tony fryklund sorry, my apologies. Twenty percent. Um, he fought Tony Franklin and he hit him with the standing, stepping in upper cut with the elbow and he was just like another level, maybe three, four, five levels above Franklin at the time. It was just so infrequent, was a real veteran. Franklin was in one of the first. You have c's that I ever worked in.

Speaker 2:          01:47:57       Nineteen 97. He was there. And so that was like his debut in the UFC. I was there when he had his debut. So Anderson was just lightened him on fire before he decided to step in an upper cut them. But I just knew he was on it just such a different level. But that was a really important learning moment for mma because people knew like, okay, if you get in a fight and a guy is a more Thai practitioner on the level of Anderson Silva, you better learn how to deal with this goddamn clinch. So here's Anderson versus a Tony Franklin and this is Anderson in, in my opinion, maybe his prime ever because he hadn't taken on all the damage and all the crazy fights that he had in the UFC. And by the time he got to Chris Weidman, I mean he was in his thirties. He's getting older or his body was starting to not perform the way it used to and then obviously he fucked up and stood in front of Weidmann, got left hooked in the head while I was clowning them.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       Then it's a lot tougher to come back when you're 40 now they've taken these losses, but it's time back then was so fucking tight and it was just so levels above what everyone else was doing. Oh yeah. They just did. Didn't belong in there with them. Like look how he's moving around. Just sort of like feeling out. Tony trying to find out what Tony's capable of trying to decide when to move. I mean he really is like a spider because he's setting up the web and he's moving around. Eventually it's going to sting you and you know it's come in and you know by the time you're moving at him, look at that. Boom. One, two starts kicking you and now he's coming after you. Oh Shit Bitch. Now you know there's a big difference between the two of you and it just feels like even if you don't know anything about fighting, you just know there's levels here. Like you can just see it. Everything he does in this fight, it's like fucking picture perfect. He steps in and look at this beautiful Thai clinch clenched his, his control of the neck and head was spectacular. Look at that. Boom, and it's bigger

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       than all these. Stronger than them like knees to the body, man. And Franklin is fucking throwing down, man. He's, he's doing his best. He was a warrior, but you'd see it when he would be. When he went up and fought at two. Oh five. And he'd be in the clench with honor and forrest griffin, like these guys couldn't do anything to them. So these guys are like, just, he's already fucked here because he's eating a bunch of really hard shots to the body and even though he's moving okay and he's like really compromised. He'll look at that beautiful right hook and then left kick, left low kick. And Anderson fought a lot from the southpaw stance. He could fight from any position he wanted to, but he fought a lot from the southpaw stance, which is also an advantage to a lot of people. It's amazing how much mma guys make it look like me and Jesus. His arm's gone limp. I mean it's this boom, boom. Wow Dude. That is nuts. It's nuts. Just the way he moves. Watch them step in here though, man. It's so crazy. Watch this

Speaker 1:          01:50:47       step in elbow. First time ever in MMA. That was Anderson in his prime and the cool. And it was one of those moments where a particularly you have like, I've had a lot in watching mma where when someone comes in and beat someone else at their strength and then you have to reorganize your mind where you're like, oh, I thought that guy was like. Because Franco was like, this guy's got really great hands, he's a really good striker. And then a guy like that lets you know like, oh, there's like another world when, you know, it's like levels. You got these guys like the Chinese Kung Fu guy and then you have all these different levels, these steps along the way in the spectrum. And then you've got like Moitai of Anderson. But then you got like Moitai of Sand Chai in Thailand. It's like several levels, past Anderson Pool cow and rob deck, Ramon Ramon dekkers.

Speaker 1:          01:51:36       And Rob came in and all the greats, you know, uh, Ernesto, who's these guys are like even further past that, you know, there's all these crazy, crazy, crazy levels to this thing. And you know, when you see a guy like Anderson you see just for the first time it was in the UFC where you have like legitimate world class, maybe not the best ever and more Thai, but legitimate worldclass Moitai skills, watching them fight. That's like a professional Moy Thai fighter. And it seems to me like, um, for whatever reason I think because in it's on its own, it works better in a real fight. So the grappling stuff in mma like pretty quickly, we got very high level grapplers pretty quickly. Like, I mean from the first UFC, you've got the best Jujitsu guys at the time or were at least one of a representative of the gracies. And then uh, you know, you got Olympic level wrestlers in there pretty quickly. Like, I mean it was, it wasn't too long before, like Dan Severn and Mark Coleman and guys like that who had like legit wrestling credits came in. But it took a long time before you got like really, really high level striker. So he got Maury Smith was the guy, he was, he was really the first was the first. Yeah, go back to that, go back to that fight again. Here's something that's

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       interesting to point out as Bas rutten was one of the early guys to strewn was after Maurice where there weren't too many besides that, like it. Those guys were like a few who actually because it took so much to learn all the other shit. Right. But the difference between boss and Maurice was that Maurice was more of a tactician and boss was a destroyer and he's like an intelligent animal. He would just like attack like vicious, ferocious striking, you know, but real aggressive but also very technical as well. Whereas Maurice is much more clever like leg kick dependent, like Maurice is actually on a higher level in terms of like professional kickboxing. Then boss boss didn't have like a lot of kickboxing fights. Maurice was a world champion, but boss had that Holland style and as an MMA fighter he was one of the first guys that we ever saw that kick so fucking hard.

Speaker 2:          01:53:31       But if you watch this fight, what you learn is like what conor mcgregor figured out. What conor mcgregor figured out is that what holds a lot of these guys back his movement and see if you look at Tony Franklin as he's moving towards Anderson, his movement, he's very limited like he can't. He can't cover distance quick enough. He has to make these little hop steps, hop steps, just slide in and blast things. Connor is fluid with his movement in and out to the point where he can step forward and obviously wouldn't be able to do that with Anderson Silva, but he can step forward and step in and step out like when he fought a Joseph, although one of the most important parts of that fight was that Aldo was trying to figure out the movement of Connor, like go to go to that fight. Joseph Aldo versus conor mcgregor and what connor was doing so good was sliding forward and sliding back.

Speaker 2:          01:54:20       There's like that one moment because it's a very short fight, but there's the one moment where he faints a thing and jumps back right here. See that? See how sleep pod, but look how like he. He's in and out. He's moving a lot and it's. It's a different thing, boom, slides back and drops the fucking left hammer on his chin and it's that movement that's so critical in a really high level. If I look, look how fluid he slides back and launches that punch at the same time. It's very interesting to me too because it was a different intensity in his movement than like when he fought. Other guys like Chad Mendez matter because he respected what Al Alto throws, alto throws heat and especially in that first round when Aldo is furious at you for disrespecting them. Like he knows he's coming with like a bomb, but yeah, just but superior movement.

Speaker 2:          01:55:04       It's also new, unorthodox movement bloom. I mean a lot of ways. They've been doing that shit and karate tournaments forever. Right. But people hadn't figured it out in MMA yet. I mean if you look at a lot of what connor had done with his stance and his movement, a lot of it resembles what you see in the karate point tournaments where they would leap in and drop a shot on you and leap out, but they weren't fighting stationary. People like. Although that just charged forward, but although got used to fighting in that man fitting more Thai guys and that kind of mma look, it's just the wrestling look. It's been, you know, it's really fascinating to me. Just on this kind of evolution was a um. Oh God, what's his name? A hutto the

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       guy who fought Demetrius Johnson who don't, who just, I don't know who fights like him now. He all the sudden he adopted this style and you're like, Holy Shit, this style gives people real problems. And it's like I get, I mean maybe I'm wrong about this, but it reminds me a little bit of almost like Mochida type thing, but it's like this, it's this weird karate kind of thing that it's like this weird evolution wake once you have all the other shit. And what connor does this, he's also got really good traditional boxing. So like, like not a lot of MMA guys couldn't do 10 rounds with me whether they, he's also got boxing so he can kind of mix it up with like traditional boxing attacks and this crazy other shit. So what's crazy about him is he'll be like throwing like, like these crazy spinning like cartwheel kicks and then he'll just have like a one, two that was like perfect, which that's new to mma or we haven't seen a lot of that in the past.

Speaker 1:          01:56:33       And you know, it's titles, those kicks are longer too. You're dealing with something that reaches much further than the traditional Moitai techniques or, or straight boxing techniques. He's throwing sidekicks. He's. His head is so far away from you when he's throwing a side kick, if he lands, if he's touching you in the chest or the sidekick, there's no opportunity for you to counterpunch he's way over there. He's bent sideways. His head is way out of reach. He might be able to catch them with a kick if he comes forward after he drops the sidekick, if you're in range, but you might get pushed back. There's a lot of factors involved. The fight and the guy who fights like that. And so who does figure that out? And then he just dropped some bombs on Wilson has that is, which is, uh, you know, I mean obviously like, you know, Demetrius Johnson is like head and shoulders above, above everybody, everybody else.

Speaker 1:          01:57:16       And he made quick work of him. But that was like, at least to me, like a little like glimpse of like, oh, well maybe if this guy is this good a grappler in, is figuring, striking out like this. Maybe he's the guy who could, you know, like be a good, a good contender. It may may happen very well. I mean he might challenge them one day, but what Henry Cejudo represents is like extreme talent, a real sponge for knowledge and information. And he's got a guy that's in his division, that's the king. That's, in my opinion, the greatest martial arts of all time. I don't think there's anybody that's been a better representation of what's possible in modern martial arts better than mighty mouse because he just doesn't get hit. And He fucks everybody up and you can't hit him, man. He's coming at you. And then all of sudden he's over here.

Speaker 1:          01:57:55       And then you've got a knee in your body and then you got punched in the face and you're trying to figure out what the fuck's happening. All the sudden you're on your back and he's dropping hammer fists on you and you, by the time you're reacting to that, he's gotten in an arm bar. You're like, what the fuck just happened to me. Yeah. It's hard to argue with the emerald. He's, he fights like he's a specialist at every discipline. Yeah. Like he's like, he's like, like you feel like he could beat all the specialists at their discipline. And it's like what George St Pierre used to kind of do. But uh, yeah, I do modern, modern MMA and more dominant. Not going to decisions destroying everybody. He's about to break the record if you already have about to, you know, who knows, right? You're right. You're right.

Speaker 1:          01:58:31       I shouldn't grant him. Weidman knocked out Anderson Silva. Nobody saw that coming. This is a crazy sport. It's not, it's, it is a crazy sport. And it's like, it seems like nobody can escape it. Right? Like it's like it takes the toughest, most invincible person you can think of as like Anderson Silva was a Ninja in untouchable Ninja and then you see him crying in the center of the ring with like a shattered, shattered, but whatever, you know, split up Shinbo. I mean it's like it's chocolate dal. Like all these landscapes. They came, saw junior dos Santos, drop a bomb on, came the Alaska isn't came collapsed. You're like, wow. And then Kane can get Kale and then junior dos Santos at that point. Then I was like, well, after that you're like, I guess we're living in junior dos Santos has world. I mean those guys destroyed everyone.

Speaker 1:          01:59:11       And then to watch him get nuked by Cain and the rematch can you just came back and beat the fuck out of him, but can the first fight really probably should have been fighting. But it was the first big fight on Fox and he had a fucked up Neiman and you couldn't move. Right. And the only one out of the way, his only two losses were when he was coming off an injury. I believe he was coming off an injury against Fabrizio overdo as well. Uh, well he was always coming off injuries by that. Is that as a problem? But the real problem with, for Breo, for doing fight was that he didn't prepare in Mexico City. Mexico City is at 7,000, 500 feet above sea level, which is where I was in Utah last week. I couldn't imagine if you didn't train there that you could be adapted to it.

Speaker 1:          01:59:49       The way for Breesa was because for he smart, he was there for like, I think a couple months at sea level training doing his entire camp in Mexico like way, even above 7,500. I think he got up to the eight thousands. Yeah, that's the house seemed in the fight. Like that made a big difference. Pretty hard to argue because cane is known as being the cardio care. Fabrizio knock on his cardio, but that's not what he's known for. He's not known for being like the Cardio and, and to see him at last time it was like, oh yeah, that's a, that's almost. It's almost like cain had so much confidence in his cardio because this is what he's been known for since like before he got into the UFC, it's like he's, he's got this unbelievable tank that he was like, no, I'll be fine with that and it.

Speaker 1:          02:00:28       And it didn't work out. Okay. But I'll say, and I know he's an injury case, but like the Cain Velasquez that showed up to ufc 200 that fought a travis brown. I don't see any heavyweight beating that guy. Well, I dunno for breach shall beat him. I mean, I don't know if he would be able to beat them again. But see, the thing is for eco, his striking improved radically hand. He's got long reach. He's a big tall guy and he's strong as fuck. And if you could take him down, good God damn luck. Everybody found. If there's another argument for anybody being the greatest heavyweight of all time besides cane, it's fabrizio. Fabrizio might have a better argument because fabricio submitted all the greats. He submitted fate or million inco submitted minotauro. Nogueira submitted Cain Velasquez. I mean, fabrizio submitted fucking everybody. He's got some amazing ones. Amazing runs. Yeah. If he didn't get killed by Steve Bay and fighting out of composure, he was fighting very emotionally. He's chasing steep a. I mean, just got wild. He was in Brazil. He wanted to fucking get after it, you know, it was pumped up there in Brazil. He's the heavyweight champ. He's fired up, but I think he might've underestimated what a bad motherfucker steep meo trick is and how the steep. They could do the same thing. Connor did slide away and drop that right hand, like pays a fucking elite

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       athlete. He's a monster. He's a monster. I think I slept on him a little bit too much for a long time. But no, you see it in, you know, he's, he's proved it like it was last minute, but I was blown away by how reckless a lot about that. I mean he just charged them like straight on. Charge them as a dangerous way to fight any MMA fighter. Yeah. It was like modern day. He made a mistake and I think he made that mistake because you got caught before that. I think he got clip before that and he got emotional because he got clipped and he tried to really ramp it up and overcompensate. Like if you watch that fight before Steve Bay knocks him out. He catches him a couple times. Yeah. Pays a sharp boxer. Very, very sharp hands and he catches you on the chin. Oh, we could put people away. Obviously he's putting everybody away now. Put Away Alistair overeem. Arguably the greatest strike or whoever fought in mma, you know, k one Grand Prix champion. Strikeforce dropped, dropped and got right back up. You know, that's, that's pretty impressive. Fucking animal. Yeah. And when I was talking to him after the fight, he thought he got kicked. I, he didn't even remember he got punched. It was all. He was like, I don't know what the fuck happened. Usually it wasn't sure if he's like, oh, I know that one.

Speaker 2:          02:02:48       Well, both of them felt they want. He's the highest level so far. You know, Steve Bay in his athleticism, his ability to move, his ability to overcome obstacles like junior had kicked the shit out of his leg to the point we had this giant Hematoma on his shin and he's still knocked him out. Yeah, that was, that was a very interesting fight. I mean it was super quick, but it was like a lot of actions super quick. Now I do the more. I'd love to see a healthy cane come back and fight. Yeah. I don't know what the extent of his injuries are and why he's been sidelined so long and you'd have to talk to him personally, but what I'm hoping is that I know a lot of it was back issues and shoulder issues. He had shoulder surgery, knee surgery, back surgery, and he had several surgeries, so it's just that style is so aggressive and so physically dependent.

Speaker 2:          02:03:30       I mean he just so fucking overwhelming that a lot of it is mental toughness, the mental toughness to push past everybody. Sometimes your body just can't keep up. Right. And so like, right in general, probably every high level MMA, UFC fighter at this point. I mean, what they're doing to their body when they're putting their body through, is it a lot for, you know, I mean it's like, it's like really pushing yourself to the absolute limit constantly. Then as you mentioned, his style is particularly, you know, like kind of physical, physical and he comes from a chaos that's notoriously a very, very tough case. Those guys are like known for like getting in wars and like really, really training hard. So I'm sure all of that shit doesn't. It's bad because if Cain cain had such amazing cardio and great footwork and beautiful striking technique as well as like real elite wrestling technique.

Speaker 2:          02:04:19       If cain fought more in a mighty mouse sense. It's just one of the reasons what made mighty mouse so good is that like if cain used his cardio, not in like a blunt way, but more in a surgical way. Right. You know, if cane, like in the junior dos Santos fight in particular, he caught them like real early in the fight and clipped him with a right hand and heard them rock them and just decided to mall them. She has got all over him, amalgam, but he took a lot of damage in the process. They both did. They both hit each other and he came overwhelmingly dominated the fight, but it wasn't. It wasn't the way mighty mouse does. Mighty mouse doesn't get hit. He's there and then he's here and then you're getting hit, you know, and then he's on your clench and then boom, you get a need in the chin and then boom, you're getting elbowed and then boom, you're getting tripped and then if he's just doing things, he's got this repertoire of possibilities that no one else has. Whereas cain just had this ferocious attitude, powerful striking and ungodly cardio, which is common at your bitch. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          02:05:19       Yeah. It's interesting. One of the things may whether it was talking about. I see him like in a few different interviews leading up to the conor fight, but just talking about the fee, it's a crazy thing that like, it almost seem like fans like the guy who takes a lot of head damage more like they don't like the guy who avoids those wars and avoid that, but it's like you sit there and look at the way Mohammed Ali left and the way floyd mayweather's leaving. Oh yeah. And it's like, okay, I get it. The fans love rope a dope more, but like, I dunno, it's kind of hard to argue with that.

Speaker 2:          02:05:48       Yeah, floyd going out, beating conor is really the perfect way to do it too because he really didn't take much damage and that fight took one good solid upper cut in the first round and then Kinda like took over. So He gets his big 50th win and then really gets to show that it's really about boxing. It's not about slugging and standing there, but when people talk about him, they don't talk about them with the same reverence that they talk about like Arturo Gotti and micky ward made because they were more entertaining. Like the people that get entertained by the style, the fighter, the wild, crazy slugger. They love those guys.

Speaker 3:          02:06:19       I mean, we all love those guys. Like, I mean, who doesn't love Travis Browne versus Andrei Arlovski like a fight like that. I mean it's like the grant and to see things like, to see somebody come back after getting like, like there's something incredible about that. It's like, it's, it's an amazing thing that mma, like when you were talking about a steeping, not knowing whether it was a kick or a punch is this amazing thing that mma does where you find out someone's true character when they're in a storm, you know, and like how they come and that's amazing. But if you are that person, you know, it's just a little bit different. Like there's human elements involved too. And like you got a family, you've got kids. You want to think for the rest of your life you want to like, and how can you argue with floyd? I mean the guy made the most money and took the least damage and as the best record on you argue with that

Speaker 2:          02:07:04       and figured out a way to neutralize really dangerous people like Canelo Alvarez. I mean, forget about the conor fight who was congress, obviously outmatched, but if you look at his fights with really elite knockout artists like manny Pacquiao neutralized him, Canelo Alvarez neutralized him. I mean, pretty much everybody fought. He fought a freestyle that was more entertaining because you wanted him to lose his, like his, his brilliance was that he got you to hate him so that you would buy a fight hoping that the guy was going to kick his ass. So

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       I remember doing this thing. Uh, I was on, I was on a radio show, um, that, uh, Brian Stan called into was like MMA radio show on Sirius radio that they used to use me on sometimes. And Brian Stan called and I remember he was just talking about like, I forget what the topic was at first it was like Joe Silva had just left and he wasn't matchmaking anymore. And he started talking about how like, how, how tough the job is, a matchmaking and how much it fucks with you when someone gets knocked out real bad. And then you're like, and maybe I shouldn't have made that match. You know what I mean? Like you kind of feel like, oh, maybe I threw someone in the wrong time. And I was kind of like, Oh man, that's a human element I really never think about in that job.

Speaker 3:          02:08:09       And then he was like, we were talking about GSP coming back. And he was like, yeah, you know, I just don't think GSP each come back like, what's he got to prove and what's it going to do, you know, why risk the brain damage, you know? And then it's like this weird thing. Like you never think about that as a fan, but when you start meeting the guys and they actually become people like I met Michael bisbing and Lewis does it show with him? They do a podcast, a believer. You believe you may really great podcasts. How do it. They do it through skype? Yeah, skype, I believe. Yeah. So He's in La and Louis is in New York and they skype it and then like when they're on the coast, we'll do it together. But uh, but so you know, like you get to know them like hang a few times and like your friends and like I think it kind of like, oh yeah, no, I don't want to see you go fight one of these killers, which is fight gsp and then retire after that.

Speaker 3:          02:08:51       Dude, like what, what are you doing? Like you've, you've had a great career, you're the champ, you get a huge money fight now you're great at, at the commentating thing. It's like when you know someone personally, it's a little bit more like, ah Nah Dude, just. But when you're just a fan, it's like, all right, I want to see you fight Yoel Romero and then with the car and then this guy and then. But like when you know someone, you're like, oh, that guy's a monster. I don't know. That's my. It makes my job way harder for like the guy I imagine and I know it's going to be a mismatch. Like you find out somebody you really care for. It was gonna fight. Somebody that is just going to light them up and you're like, oh, are you going to win this? You know, that very public moment with a Brendan shot.

Speaker 3:          02:09:28       But it was a very interesting, compelling moment because it's like a thing where it's like, yeah, you're like, you're talking to your friend Tommy, you're also an analyst. I'm talking to a good friend who I knew as a good friend was already one foot out the door and had a bunch of other things that were going on and was one of the rare guys that has massive potential to do things outside the sport. Yeah, he's killing it. He's killing. It was right. Look at me and he's smashing it with his podcast, smashing it with the fighter and the kid podcast he does with count to machinate with his live touring. It was amazing to see him. Uh, he did a fucking great job on all the stuff leading up to conor conference. Like he was excellent. He was like the only mma analysts who was in there kind of breaking shit down.

Speaker 3:          02:10:06       It was great. It's like why? So all, all that to just have one or two more fights and maybe take some real band. Really see one thing if he really wanted to do that. Like if he was obsessed and that's what he wanted to do, he wanted to win the heavyweight title and that was 100 percent of his focus was. But he wasn't there. I mean maybe it was when he first started his career and often times your motivation shifts. You get knocked out a few times and he had been knocked out several. By then he got knocked

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       out by Minotauro. He got knocked out by big Ben Rothwell. He got smashed by Travis Brown. He got knocked out by Roy Nelson. And these are out cold knockouts, so like there was so many of them and I was seeing it so often. And then towards the end I was noticing just a lack of enthusiasm. It wasn't the same as those. It wasn't the same fire that allowed them to knock out Mirko Cro, cop. It wasn't the same sort of intensity. You, you told me last time I was on the show that you've experienced that a smart guys have a tougher time. Yeah. Coming back from getting knocked out because I found that really interesting. Maybe that's part of the case with him. It was like, it's hard to avoid knowing the information. Yeah, most certainly. I mean if you're a person who being you can be a smart person, just compartmentalize things and figuring out how to control the variables in your mind and just be refocused on what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          02:11:22       It's not to say that people come back aren't smart, but I think, uh, I mean people, it's not to say also that people who don't, who fight aren't smart because a lot of people think of fighters is not being smart. I think that's not true at all. I think there's a lot of people who fight who aren't smart, but I think the people who excel have exceptional mind power as well as physical power. I think some of them are like a, like a guy like a dominant Cruz. It's like a very smart guy. I mean there's guys like that, right? Stands by saying I'm very intelligent guy and then when you go to champions, like mighty mouse is super smart and he's a very, very articulate guy and it doesn't show any damage at all. I mean, I'm sure there are some meat heads also out there, but you know, it's, it's certainly like a mix.

Speaker 2:          02:12:02       It's A. Yeah. Carlos condit, he's another one. There's a lot of guys who fight, um, that just aren't like that though. There's a lot of guys who were just like super aggressive and they just do well and they kick ass and you know, the guys who know that they're experiencing traumatic brain injury, they, they understand the consequences are, they're unavoidable. Unless there's some new medical breakthrough that allows you to heal cte, which is super, super possible. Yeah, well absolutely. I mean if you described the medical breakthroughs we have now 50 years ago, you'd be talking about magic. So yeah, my buddy Steve Graham was on the US ski team like in the 19 eighties and he had scars when I first met him. He had already had like, I mean in his life, I want to say he's had more than 20 knee surgeries and I think I'm being super conservative because I think it's way more than that.

Speaker 2:          02:12:54       I think he literally had. He's had 50 surgeries including eye surgeries. Um, he's had shoulder surgery, everything. But when I met him, his knees were so fucked up. He had these big slices up and down the side of his knees where they had opened him up and tried to screw things back together again from skiing, just mangling his knees in the old days of skiing and those same operations. Today I have one on this knee. You can't even see the scar. It's little tiny dots because they did it arthroscopically and they put it in a cadaver unit and healed in six months. I was doing Jujitsu again. No pain, no loss of range of motion. Everything feels

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       stronger than I felt before. So like that's just the medical science that occurred in 20 years, 20 years from his operation to my operation. What's it gonna be 20 years from now, it's totally possible they'll develop some sort of stem cell technique to regenerate brain tissue. Yeah. Well this is why it's so. It's so crazy the bulb in human history where at, where we're like, guys, if we can just not kill each other for like another couple of years, we might do some really beautiful, amazing shit. Right? Like we really might. We might. Why? It's crazy that one of our big threats is North Korea. Yeah. Because that represents like one of the oldest styles of running a country ever. And it's really, um, I do, I do. I think trump's been really bad on a, on that issue. And like, that's fucking, that is terrifying.

Speaker 3:          02:14:16       I was really happy when you had a Michael Malice on because I've learned a lot about North Korea from that. Yeah. He knows so much about his book, dear readers, excellence. And yes, it's an excellent book. And he's just a fascinating human being. Yeah, got it. But it's, you know, it's like you have, as we were saying before, like it's like a hostage situation, but the guy holding the hostages has nukes, which makes that like a very different type of hostage situation. Any shooting them in the sky but also duds over Japan. Yes, yes. But there also is like people, because again, the media which just absolutely has a blind spot for the military industrial complex and the horror of American wars. So you get, you don't get the full picture. I think like to me it's very logical why he's shooting off rockets left and right.

Speaker 3:          02:15:02       Like he, I mean self preservation is a pretty obvious motivator and people like Gaddafi who come out and say, oh, okay, you international community, you said you don't want us to have nuclear arms. So then will disarm. We'll end our nuclear program where they do that. We move in there and throw them out and get the ends up getting sodomized to death, you know. So that's like if you're this guy you're like, well I'm going to not go that route right. So now I'm going to show you, and basically he's showing you I can fucking nuke South Korea. I can nuke these fucking places if you come at me. Uh, that being said, you know, he's a madman, he's totally a madman who's holding people hostage and it's horrific. But there are like certain, okay, if you have a hostage situation, there are some reasonable ways to handle that and some ridiculous ways to handle that.

Speaker 3:          02:15:50       So like when you have a hostage situation, I think it's reasonable to negotiate with the guy. I think it's reasonable to take them out if you have a shot. You know what I'm saying? If someone has a shot and like too many, like, like people won't be hurt, we can take them out, take the shot. What you don't do is stand outside and start talking shit. So the guy who's got the hostages. Yeah. Know if trump's not thinking of it as anything other than like a Rosie O'donnell. Yes. He talks shit about Rosie O'donnell. Who's calling the sky rocket man? Where's that? Kind of like with Rosie O'Donnell. But you know, there's the, there's a thing about trump. I'm no, I'm no fan of his, but there's something, I kind of get a thrill. I got a kick out of how he'd Piss off people who I'm not a huge fan of.

Speaker 3:          02:16:29       I'll tell you though, I love Hillary. When she did the things he, Bernie Hillary. I love the nicknames until it was rocket man. I was really into the nicky nicknames and you're like, whoa. Hey Buddy, this isn't funny anymore. This guy's got nukes. But there's the um, well, look, when he, it was a morning Joe, a cohost, Mika Brzezinski shape. So she made a thing and on the show were they, there was a picture on Time magazine with trump with like this, with his hands under his arms and she made a joke on the show and she goes, oh, how come he doesn't want to show his hands? Maybe because they're teeny. Okay. That was a joke. She made the sentinel essentially. It's a little Dick joke. I mean, that's what she was making herself. So Donald Trump, like immediately tweets out I think about her and he goes, when she was at my, uh, when she was at my party, she had, she had scars from the facelift.

Speaker 3:          02:17:17       She's still bleeding, bleeding from the face looks for that. They asked me to sit with her, did not go. Yes, yes. So it's this thing now. Then of course the media goes right into the mode of like, how could you insult a woman's, you know, like looks and it's like, I don't know man, like if you can't take the heat, get out of the fucking Dick joke. And then people were like actual journalists like grown up people who consider themselves journalists. I saw reporting a week later. It's been confirmed that Mika Brzezinski wasn't even at that event and didn't even. Yeah, you fucking idiots. This isn't a real thick. He's just getting her back. Like she hit him and he's hitting her back. Like, yes, if you're, if you're vain enough to be having plastic surgery, probably you're not going out while you're still bleeding from the plastic surgery.

Speaker 3:          02:18:01       But like it's the point is, and I kind of liked that about trump, it's like, oh, finally someone being unapologetic and being like, I disagree with you hardcore because I think it's stupid and childish and like, are you fucking dumb? It's beneath being the president of the United States and this idea that you're going to make up a story about a woman bleeding from plastic surgery to get over because she said you have little hands. That's some weak bitch. Okay. As you repeat it back to me, it does sound like some wheat. Sweet. If that was your friend. Hold on a second. Okay. That was your friend and one of your friends was making fun of the fact that you, you had small hands and so you went on a radio show or podcast and may not the whole story about him. Bitch. Okay. So far. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:18:45       So I'll agree with you on that. You're right, it is kind of a bitch move 100 percent. So I'll agree with you. It doesn't really happen even so I could get where you could say it's kind of a bitch move. Like you should be above this, but I get what I enjoy about it is if then everybody else like the like 95 percent of the mainstream media's reaction is how could you attack a woman's looks like how you dummies that. Maybe you'll think next time about. I just. I hate the thing that Mika feels entitled to make a small Dick joke and then feels entitled the next day to play though. Are you insulting a woman's looks like it's actually worse, right? If he was telling the truth because what she's saying, he has no control over his. No control over her head with the of his hands and he was

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       born with, but she does have control over whether or not she's so vain. She lets a doctors stick a tube down her throat and cut her half alive body and stitch it tighter to give the illusion of youth. Now. I don't think that really happened. At least that's what a lot of it didn't really happen, but if it did happen and he was talking about that after she was talking shit, then it makes sense. What doesn't make sense? It's not true. Yeah, so I get, I guess what I. I do agree with you the point you made, so I will walk back that a little bit. You're right. It's kind of a shitty move, but there's just something I did like the fact that he's willing to do that. Someone's like fighting back against the PC authoritarianism, which I do see as a really big fucking problem.

Speaker 1:          02:20:05       I don't see this as like a little problem that's annoying. Like I think it's a really big problem and I don't care about the dignity of the president. I liked that being undermined as much as possible. I, I don't think the whole idea that there's dignity to this bullshit job that shouldn't even exist. I hate. So I liked that being. I like that aspect of trump do. What do you. What'd you think about when board Dang got shit? Because they asked him at the airport. Just one of them tmz things. You walk through the airport, they go, if you had to cook for Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, what would you serve? It goes hemlock and they lease. That's a fucking bordain throw away. Funny punchline. That's just good chef humor right there. God Damn Dude. I was looking at all the comments and so many of them were using Hashtag Potus to talk about potus that way and to talk mean they were talking about like, he's the king, like these sheep.

Speaker 1:          02:20:51       But they also switched sides. It's like the Obama people in the trump. People are so happy to just, just literally one day. Oh, you take that position and I'll take this position now. No problem. No, no feeling of like, oh, this is a little bit weird. I was literally three days ago lecturing people about how he's our president and now I'm like not my president. Like you don't feel any, any, you know. And, and there's this thing that I go, you know, I remember you said this and I've quoted this many times on my show. Part of the problem, my podcast, they're a plug in a problem. I would have a part of the problem, but no more alliteration. But I don't know if you were quoting someone or this was years originally, but you were describing the, uh, the occupy Wall Street movement and you use the white blood cells as the way to describe them.

Speaker 1:          02:21:33       You might, might've been quoting someone else when you said it, but, or maybe it was years originally, but I remember hearing you say this, I think it was mine when I was saying is it's obviously there's a disease and they don't know exactly what it is, but the white blood cells are moving in and they're surrounding this infection that's trying to figure out what it is. I thought it was like such a perfect analogy and it applies to occupy Wall Street. It also applied to like the tea party movement in some other way. And you're right, the point of being like, look, a white blood cell does not understand the complexity of a virus. It doesn't have the cure for a virus. It doesn't have like that. But it knows corruption rush. Like that's the thing. It's like corrupt and rush. And I think that a lot of the trump thing is that too.

Speaker 1:          02:22:14       It's like white blood cells and they know that this pc authoritarian thing that trump fights, that they know that's the virus and this is to them the most anti audit report. He has half fake people. You know, I did that to me today and I posted it on instagram. I'm very happy with the results. You're doing way better than trump's. Way better than that motherfucker. I don't have any fake people on twitter because first of all, I'm not the president. I think when you're the president, you automatically get like a shit ton of fake people. Billionaire gop, patron behind trump's social media bot army. Yeah. Of course he has a media bought. Of course. Why would he not use that? I mean, it's just like to him that's like a tool, like what? It's like when the Samurai's refuse to adopt gun pile gunfire, they refuse to adopt firearms.

Speaker 1:          02:23:00       That fuck that shit. We're using bows and arrows and swords like men and they got gone down. That was the end of the Japanese empire as we knew it at the time. They just aged version of what Kodak did. Oh, right, right, right. Kodak was when digital came out, they were like, Eh, we don't really like digital will be the film guys. Fuck you guys go with digital and then after awhile they tried. They'll put out to digital cameras, but then this cameras were on phones. Bitch, you missed the whole thing. You were an industry leader. Yeah, you went way behind the curve, but you're the number one typewriter distributor now. That's all it means. If you are running for President Dave Smith and you don't use a Bot army, I'll be very disappointed in you. I'd be like, how can I give you my support if you're not even willing to use a bot army when we.

Speaker 1:          02:23:39       We're talking about Smith Twenty four now, 20, 24. I think bots are like old technology. To your point. You're right. I'm sorry dude. I'm not going to get elected with that crap. How short sighted of me I go, dude, that's totally. That's 2020 things. That's bullshit thinking. Yeah. Yeah. The new stuff is all you get to figure out how to hack into neural implants. That's right. I'm also. A lot of my campaign is going to be running against the previous four years of the Kanye West Administration and everything that they did wrong and be like, look, trump didn't solve the problem. Kanye didn't solve the problem. Now let's take a nice libertarian position. Will be Kanyi will have established colony in Africa and uh, he will have read designed Calabasas in Africa and they'll all be just driving around and bentleys and shit and duck in Lyons.

Speaker 1:          02:24:21       It's like, it really is though. Like it's, it's almost like seems anything seems plausible show will live into reality, but it is a thing that it is like a, like Andrew Breitbart said, this is what I've realized over the last year is that a politics is downstream from culture. Yeah. That was the truth. I completely missed this. Uh, uh, maybe not completely, but I definitely underplayed how important the culture is and how that really dictates. It's not, it's not. It's not like, Oh, if you went to like, like a, you know, central Africa tomorrow and went, don't worry, I changed the minimum wage law. Like, things will be okay. It's like, it's like there, there's a cultural element that you have to account for also, and the Donald trump thing. It's just kind of like, in a way, what's so interesting to me is it's like, okay, so like trump's a buffoon and he's a cartoon.

Speaker 1:          02:25:06       I mean literally a cartoon like he's got is the color of his skin, the color of his hair. Like you watch CNN, the fitting suits, overweight body like crazy hair. You're watching the news and then a cartoon character comes on, but in this weird way he's had this ability to like hold up a mirror. The rest of American society is also a billionaire, so he's an undeniably a winner and as far as we decide, hard to argue. Then on top of that, he's unapologetic and that's something we all admire because we all wish we could do that because we can't. And that's something that pisses off the left. Yeah, I like that. That I think is right at the heart of why they hate trump, which is something I'm fascinated by and I think it is. I really think being an unapologetic white man, [inaudible] rubs the left wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:25:51       Like, look, you can be a white man and you can be an ally, but you gotta be you gotTa. Be Down here, you know you can't be like up here. You can't be like, Hey, I have an opinion and this is how I feel. You got to be down here. Like I have an opinion and I know my opinion's been overrepresented on his Jamie kill scenes taken enough heat. You don't have to go after him again on this podcast like you just did. I saw what he did. Will welcome Jamie back. I will do. I will come back and he did some silly things. Got a little carried away. Exactly. People make bad decisions. He got a. He got influenced by a silly ideology and you know, and it came out. But then he did some great work for those people. Like there was a fucking speech that he did in front of this giant thing in Brooklyn.

Speaker 1:          02:26:31       I forget what it was about, but he was doing this, a speech about about Donald Trump and about black lives matter and it was rick really well worded stuff, whether you agree with it or not. Like he did good work inside that, that little sort of paradigm. I met Jamie Kilstein when I was like a brand new comedian, like just starting standup comedy and he was, you know, to me like doing things that were really cool, like he was on the road with Stan hope and like to me that was like, oh, you're like, you made it, like that's amazing. Like you're doing the thing that we all want to do. And he was just super kind and helpful to me. I was a young comment and so I always just have like a, as a person, I like Jamie and all the things I don't like about Jamie where we like seeing him on your show or seeing something he tweeted or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:27:17       So it's like as a person I always liked him and then the public persona, like he knows a few people. Apologies, but I'd be happy to. Yeah, I mean I think we're all vulnerable to a certain extent and we're vulnerable to like if you tap into a vein and you have success with a certain way of behaving and thinking and you know, you put blinders on because this is benefiting you. I mean we see that financially with people were talking about before you see that culturally, socially, and I think Jamie tapped into like the social vein of success in this very extreme ideology, this extreme feminist male feminist ally ideology, the denial of the differences between the men, the women in. And it's like he's a cliche and a lot of ways, right? Because he's a small guy and you know, he's very slight and you always see a small guy who a Vegan and a feminist.

Speaker 1:          02:28:06       You're like, oh, it's just, he's one of those guys. You know what I mean? It's like you fall into these weird sort of predetermined patterns of behavior, these categories and he just was a black belt at that, you know, but also banging chicks. It turns out you can't, you can't be in that world. And also like plus eight. As it turns out, so crazy me. Isn't that the ultimate feminist? He loves women, top to bottom. I don't know what the actual issue that they had with them. I don't really know either, but I will say this, okay. That he hangs out in that social justice warrior crowd that he was hanging out with. They will throw out the rape word for everything. You can look at someone the wrong way and they'll call that rape and what they accused Jamie have was inappropriate and manipulative behavior toward women.

Speaker 1:          02:28:50       I mean literally means trying to get posted. Like it's not even. You're not even exaggerating if you go to them to this in this social justice warrior world, if you were to be like, hey, why don't we like get outta here and go back to my place and you're like, no, we can't go. Come on, let's go. She said no, and then you said, come on. That is. That is inappropriate manipulative behavior. Skeptics conference and a man in an elevator asked a woman if she wanted to come to his room and have some coffee and she did a whole speech the next day about how men should not, if they're with a woman alone and it's late at night, do not ask them to coffee because you're going to imply that this woman is in danger and make her feel uncomfortable and all this crazy shit like, oh, so a guy was trying to fuck you.

Speaker 1:          02:29:35       Doesn't that happen all the time like you're, you're, you're making a speech about this t trying to control the behavior of men to the point where they're not mad anymore, is shaped them and formed them into some weird sort of pc version of you would like this. No biological difference between the men and the women. Men being only allies and like what? It's so strange. The whole thing is so weird and like, you know, it's always these people who seem to be so resentful and angry at the male female relationship and interplay and like ankle and God wanted to fuck you is so horrible. Coincidentally. Almost always not attractive. It's you don't see a lot of tens walking around going like, oh, it's so unfair. There's a few that snuck in there, but you don't see a ton of them like publicans. Well, here's, here's the thing is like the sheriffs Clark's that's right.

Speaker 1:          02:30:24       And they put them right up front. We put them right up front, like see, look at her tits, giant tits and a little waist. She's a fucking feminist. Well the truth is if you want to get into a conversation, a real honest conversation about privilege, right? And who has privileged and who doesn't have privilege. I mean hot chick privilege, it's pretty shit is pretty strong. I mean, but you know, hot chicks walk around in a different world than regular women and men do. I mean it's just a different thing and that's part of the nature of. But you know, whatever. I mean that's like who human beings are, but it's like I, you don't hear her complaining about it as much because she's winning at this, at this exchange. You know, women have to sort of keep their mouth shut about that shit. Have to like kind of wanting to get away with it. We're working on our end over here. You know, I, I saw this a tweet this woman put out that said a pro tip if you, uh, don't ever date a man who doesn't identify as a feminist.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       And I was like, that is so crazy. That's such a crazy thing to say. Like, first of all, pro tip is one of the Douchey is things you could ever say and not say something funny. If you say pro tip, what you say after that, better be proposed truss. He's Jesus Christ. See pro tip and you're serious. I just, you're a fucking condescending, angry person from the jump.

Speaker 3:          02:31:41       And it's very rarely a very successful pro who's giving me this protest. Second of all,

Speaker 2:          02:31:45       the idea of every man that you date should be a feminist. Well, every man date shouldn't be a person who discriminates. I agree with that. They should be openminded tissue, be egalitarian, but the idea that they have to subscribe to a feminist ideology that this can't just be fair and honest and curious and have real conversations with you. Open and objective. That's not good enough. Now they have to identify with this ideology that the only way you could ever have equality, true equality within the sexes of the man, identifies as being a feminist. Like that's what feminism is. Feminism is not supportive. Women know feminism is total uniformity and there's no discrimination whatsoever. And until that happens, you have to be a feminist.

Speaker 3:          02:32:29       Yeah. And feminism to me is like, like modern day feminism at least. It's just like a hate group. I just don't know how else to describe them. They're just a hate group. It's like if you take them at their word, you know, the way you, you could take any hate group at their word, you know, and they'd be like, Oh, you know, we're not a hate group. We just care about white people, white people's rights and the white children, Blah Blah. And then you're Kinda like, oh, okay, well let me come to a meeting and then by like that meet and you're like, man, they sure do seem to hate black people at this meeting. We're not hate group. We just think that all straight white men are trash until proven otherwise. Exactly. Exactly. And if you want to be there and you're of that group, you better first, uh, you know, like confessed to your original sin for being and be guilty the whole time and be constantly, you know, kind of repenting and then you can be there. But even with them,

Speaker 2:          02:33:12       there's a giant spectrum, right? There's a lot of women that are just what they don't want is some fucking creepy boss to talk, you know, crazy, creepy sexual shit to them. And they have to absorb it because they want to move up the corporate ladder and they're discriminated sexually in the office space. They're discriminated when it comes to, uh, you know, uh, promotions and raises and you know, the position in the company that's. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:33:35       sure. Yeah, that's fucking gross. If I don't want that to be a woman

Speaker 2:          02:33:38       working in an office filled with fucking men, think about trying to have sex with you all the time.

Speaker 3:          02:33:43       Absolutely, absolutely. And there are certain struggles that like guys are unaware of the or maybe not unaware completely because you like you're bringing it up right now, but we don't experience certainly like you don't know what it's like to walk around life as like a tiny hot chick that men just constantly want to fuck. I mean that's, I'm sure that comes from being catcalled you know when they first came out with that video that went viral of the chip being catcalled around New York City. My first reaction was I thought it was very interesting and I said, because you go, if you're a guy who doesn't cat call checks, which is like the category I fall into. That's just not my style of getting laid. I've never thought of just be like, let me get that ass Motha like as you walked by me. But that did roll off the tongue kind of naturally.

Speaker 3:          02:34:22       So maybe I should try try that. Maybe that'll get me a little more and made me get it nervous. So it's interesting to see that because you're like, oh, I don't do that. So as a guy who doesn't do that, I'm the only category of people who are unaware of it. Me Know how they made that video. I found out later. Yeah, I did find out later, please tell everybody like hours and hours of footage. They basically went all day long and disproportionately took footage of black neighborhoods. They went around in circles in this black neighborhood in Harlem and in Times Square in these two areas. And they basically got a lot of black guys, uh, talking, uh, you know, uh, to uh, a very attractive, very attractive. But yes, the crime of the century, but at least it's like, look, I do think there's something to be said for like, oh, okay, look, I don't know what the experience of getting cat called is.

Speaker 3:          02:35:12       This might be pissing off some women. So okay, like, let's, let's look at that. But then there's also lots of struggles of men that women don't necessarily know about. And the problem with feminists is that in modern feminist is that they're not going like, hey, we both have struggled here, let's have a conversation. We're not like we're humanists were people lists, let's have a cup. They're like, were feminists were on this team and we're going to talk about our struggles and lecture you about it and you can never discuss the opposite. The truth and the past gets so perverted like they, they'd speak. The past was all just oppressive gender roles toward women. It's like A. Actually in reality, there were oppressive gender roles for everybody in the past. And it's very debatable who they were more oppressive for. Like in my grandmothers and grandfathers day, oppressive gender roles landed my grandfather in combat fighting and war like it. It wasn't that, you know, it wasn't like, oh, the men didn't have any struggles that the women didn't know about. Like again, we technologically advanced, we don't need those gender roles, which we did need for lots of years before technology. There's no way for humans to survive. I mean, go go for a hundred years ago and say let's abolish gender roles. It's like, what's it like? You're going to have kids until you know, three of them died from polio.

Speaker 2:          02:36:25       I mean that's what that was the point of the Google memo. There's still things that people gravitate towards that or male with more frequency than they do with are female and then you have these aberrations, these women that want to be mma fighters and these men that want to be florists and you have all these, all the different people in between and to try to get equality and that was like one of the things that was so frustrating about people is that we're not saying that women shouldn't be equal. They can't be equal. We're saying they're not equal. They're not equally represented in this particular field. This particular discipline. Now let's explore why. Sure. Things that I thought was so crazy about the google memo was that the guy had like a page and a half of like dedicated to what would be a way to get women more interested in tech and he had all these citations for all these different studies that he was quoting. When they reprinted it and several

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       sources, they remove the citations and they, you know, they would put like these, they take these quotes out of context and highlight them and make them larger and it's like, which I find strange to be like, oh yeah, I read part of that thing and it seems fairly reasonable to me. And I saw it very misrepresented in the way people were talking about it on the news. Um, and like it's just this weird thing where you're like, okay, look, if you do like, I like, equality is what exactly do we even mean by that? It's like, yeah, the equality under the law or something like that. Like, okay, sure. But like, no, like men and women are different. Men are different. Like you and I are different, you know, way more about politics than I do. And you know way more about hunting elk and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          02:37:54       Well that's always going to be the case. It's not an equal thing because we're not mathematics. I've got a huge gap to close on your El content knowledge. I got to get at it. I tried to get out of time. That's a weird one that I'm probably shouldn't have done. Dipped my toes into. So absorbed. No, but you're absolutely right. In the case with all of it is like snowflakes I've been working on completely different and have different and the idea that equality, I mean you'll never have that have any true science and then the thing with like, okay, with women it seems like feminist basically like they almost well bashing men and bashing the traditional kind of masculine gender role. They also seem to embrace it and want that for women. So like if men are, they really want it for transgender people, that's where it gets super slippery because the left wants really classic feminine, like Transgender People.

Speaker 3:          02:38:45       When Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner, he's painting his toes and wearing high heels and short skirts and it gets a tit job, gets his jaw sod down. Like, you can't just be a woman. Got to be looking woman. You got to be a woman with a fucking facial surgery. You've got to be beautiful. And we go, yes, you, you're amazing. You go, that's right. If a girl embraces those classic gender roles, like wearing high heels and short skirts and her tits are pushed together and like, Oh God, you're falling into this classic gender trap. That's right. Or, or if a woman said, oh, I want to be a housewife and like raise my kids and live a traditional lifestyle, or if I'm going to move for my husband or something like that, a married man and you say that, well for you go girl. And you see the same thing happen where they literally the same thing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:33       They'll hate if a man does the law. So if you had read, uh, you know, a feminist article about mma seven years ago, it would have been all about toxic masculinity and male aggression and all this stuff. But as soon as Ronda Rousey was doing it, it's like, that's our girl, let's go do it. If dirty comedy, offensive comedy, they're like, no, fuck that, that's your mail. But, but as soon as amy Schumer is doing it, it's like, let's go. Like they love for a woman to do all the things that they always said they hate. And the crazy thing is like they'll, they'll say these things where it's like, you know, like women, um, whatever it is, women are uh, you know, whatever percentage, like 51 percent of the population and they're only like 10 percent of Congress or something. I'm just making these numbers up. Something like in that ballpark. And there'll be

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       like, well this is a problem. And you're like, well, wait a minute. I mean I'm all for freedom so if there's any barrier in someone's way, get that out of there. But if people are free and like men choose to go be politicians and women more choose to go into like, you know, like nursing and like these other light kind of like maternalistic fields that women go into a lot and you're like, okay. So like, are you sure? The answer is just that they should be more like men. Like maybe this is like saying something better about women, like men are going on or like going into ruling over other people and women are going into like a nurturing field. Like maybe the fact that women prioritize family over money is not a bad thing that needs to be reorganized. Great thing. There's gonna be some women that choose to pursue a career at the very highest levels of capitalism and there's gonna be some that have zero interest in doing that.

Speaker 1:          02:41:01       And that's the same with men as well. It's just we can't deny the patterns that we see. Well we should figure out is like are there barriers if there's bears unjust barriers to keep women from things. And I'm sure there are those things we should concentrate on. Yes. But concentrating on leveling the number of people in Congress and that's essentially sexual affirmative action. You want to get more women in those positions because you think they have. How many women do you have running? That's when you get to Hillary Clinton. I mean like we want a woman to be president. Okay. How about a lying old lady who faints a lot? Is that one? Okay? You'd be like, no. Well that's ridiculous. Well that's what you got when you wanted to get only women. You got that one? Okay, so what the fuck do you want to do now?

Speaker 1:          02:41:42       Because what you're doing is you can't just decide that you only want, you know, you want 50 percent men, 50 percent women in all. What about coal mining? You want to have 50 percent of women who die had fucking coal mining accidents. You know the disproportionate number of men who die on the job. It's, it's staggering. But that's my point with the feminist thing where it's kind of this, this is why it's, there'll be like, well, we're just for equality. It's like, okay, well if you're just for equality, how come I never hear about how the death, the workplace death rate is like disproportionately men. I don't mean disproportionately, a little bit. It's like over 90 percent. Then about prison sentencing differences though. These are major, major things, but people die or get thrown in a cage, but we, you know, that doesn't come up at all because it's like if it's black men they look, well that's right then and only then okay, because, but then of course it's also gotta be like the white racism white male and that's linked with the fee.

Speaker 1:          02:42:30       The woman's struggle. Like the black struggle, like they've kind of piggybacked onto that. They should take it back on to Lbgtq w. well they kind of are. I mean I hear that all the time. I actually, I heard one person on Msnbc and they were like, we just care about the rights of, of women and minorities and lgbt people and immigrants and something else. And I was like, just say not white men. Can I just save you some time? Say Not Straight CIS white men. We don't everyone else your name in them all in groups. So just say it like, just cut to the chase just for time. And they're doing it to align themselves. They're doing it to align themselves with other people that are going to have their back and agree with them when they go to war with it that way because the truth behind them, like what you said before,

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       that where you go, if there's any barriers, let's remove that. But then you get to a certain point where you're just like, if we're being honest, there are no real barriers. There are no real barriers to, to and, and, and if there are, let's go after them. But just on the big picture, like talking about things, if you're like a woman who really wants to do something in 2017 in a first world country like the United States of America, I don't see. I mean there are laws against paying, uh, a woman less than a man at the same job. There are all these rules that are lots of people who will like, like actually bend over backwards [inaudible]. They're really looking to have like a, a, you know, diversity. Like corporations really love diversity. Everyone in show business knows that's true. So it's like, okay, I don't see a real barrier.

Speaker 3:          02:43:54       But then when you do, when they can't find one, they'll, they'll kind of create this barrier that you can't say. So if we give people a bunch of freedom and then women make certain choices in men, make certain choices in this leads to, on average men making 23 percent more than women. Then they go, well, and I go, well, there's no barrier. It's just women making choices. They go, well, well there's this, this barrier called Patriarchy that's somehow, you know, and we've got to like, it's because these women have been socialized into thinking that they're. So then they'll find this thing that you can't prove or disprove. You can't test it. Just kind of like. But we live in a rape culture, right? It's like fighting terrorism, the war on terror. It's the same shit. It's like, well, if it's just an idea, I guess we're always fighting that idea.

Speaker 3:          02:44:35       And until women assume the power position and there's a disproportion of number of women in Congress and this proportionate number of women who are police officers and women who are judges, women, her lawyers and when they were in all positions of power, if men feel the heavy boot of the oppressive woman until then until fuck up. And it's so. It's all so ridiculous. It's just all so silly. It's like what? What area of life is there where things are proportionately representative while black people in basketball? No, not unproportionate. I'm saying proportionately. So they don't make up 13 percent of basketball. Yeah. Like they make, they make up. I mean it's like where, where do you find racist? We need to even that out. Yes, absolutely. More white people and Asians and whites and down a little bit. Make it easier to follow. Yeah. More black people in hockey.

Speaker 3:          02:45:24       That's a mess. But it's all just so it's all so fucking like we should celebrate the differences we have and just don't be. Don't be racist. That's it. Now let's say don't be sexist, don't be racist, but you don't get Brownie points just because you're a chick you don't know and you shouldn't, you shouldn't get into this thing where it's like, and I know it's like I've heard like people particularly like a left wing leading feminists or like female comics who are feminists, who I know several of them out without calling out by name, but uh, but I've, I've heard and they'll, they'll get very. And one of them said to me once they go, you know, Dave, you're whole thing is just that you hate women. Oh, like, but it's like hate women. Like what do you saw women say that to Brian and you?

Speaker 3:          02:46:09       Nobody said it was hilarious. He goes, you know what? I've heard that before. And every woman that said that I hated it was a great response because it was a stupid argument. It is. She was just like saying like a blanket statement. You hate women. No, no you. But I just go. I challenged a lot of people on, on the left who, who talk about race or sexism in these things. I just challenge you to to just entertain the possibility for like one second, entertain the possibility that you're not right about all of this stuff and that the correct position is to treat everybody equal. Now I know that sounds really, really wild and out there, and I'm not taking into account my white privilege and the history, but just entertain for one second the possibility that the correct answer is to treat everybody equal and not judge them based on their race.

Speaker 3:          02:46:55       And then you, if you entertain that for one second, you'll start realizing like, oh, holy shit, if that's true, I'm really the one being the biggest here. I've seen this. So like, uh, um, if you know the roast battle shows at the comedy store here, it goes up and they started doing them in New York too. Now they're really popular. There are like these group of female comics that will come out and I don't even begrudge them for this, but they'll come out and just hardcore like root for the female comic like there they'll post about like just want to see more women succeed at roast battle coming out tonight to cheer on my girl, Blah Blah, and there'll be this dynamic where like their first two jokes, you know, they'll just get this like it's just like, you know, female voices from the corner where the comics hang like super, super loud for, for the chick comic and like whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:47:38       I don't begrudge them anything like, fine, come do that. But it's just like those same people who will be like, you're like against women. Like I would never in a million years go out to a show and be like, I'm just rooting for the men today. Like I don't think this way. I'm not like on team man, but you are on team women. Like it's just, it just seems to me that there's a lot of that going on. You know what I mean? That shit where it's like you kind of project this thing that you see racism everywhere or you see sexism everywhere, but all I really see is you fucking lecturing people based on race. In their mind they're allowed to do it the same way Cain Velasquez allowed to have brown pride and his chest. Yeah. Kinda the same thing. Like you're, you're disenfranchised or marginalized, so you're allowed to stay.

Speaker 3:          02:48:21       Even if you're not you playing that victim card as a woman and you're allowed to say, I'm here to support my girl. Like I was talking about this on stage of the day. I saw a bumper sticker on a car and said girls kick ass. And I was like, some of them, yeah, some of them are lazy slobs equity. Going to align yourself with 150 million women just in this country alone. That's ridiculous. He was saying if a guy had a bumper sticker, it said boys kick ass. He'd be like, follow that guy and find out where he's been fucking these kids because first of all, you'd never say boys, boys kick ass. You put that into your bumper. Sit. What the fuck are you? You'd pull them over. Let me see your license. Where do you live, man? What do you do for a living? What's that bumper sticker about? What the fuck do you mean by that? Yes, and I don't need like I almost feel like an asshole sometimes where I preface everything with a disclaimer like, and I'm not saying this and I'm not, but I just want it to be clear

Speaker 1:          02:49:07       that I'm not saying there aren't exceptions to the rule, but it's also kind of strange to me that like if you want to celebrate women, why are you celebrating such a masculine quality? Like it's kind of like, it's like, look, there are white players who are great basketball players, right? There are the Levitsky was an amazing basketball player, but if I just wrote some like white people kick ass at basketball, it's like, well actually that movie tone in general, women don't kick ass in general. Generally speaking, that's a male thing to do. So I'm not saying there's not exceptions to that, but you're like, you're writing white people kick ass in basketball. It's kind of misleading, right? Well, there's that thing that's coming out, that movie with Steve Carell where he plays a, that man who had a basketball tennis match against Billie Jean King and he was like barely ranked, who's terrible tennis player and he fuck Billie Jean King up and it was and he was like, sort of mocking her the whole way and it was like a real hallmark, right?

Speaker 1:          02:49:57       I don't know about that. He just played professional tennis player, but he wasn't the best and Billie Jean King was the best woman in the world and they played and the Steve Carell character beater is now was not what happened. I believe that's what happened. I'm, I'm getting them conflated with Renee Richards, the guy who used to be a man and then became a transgender woman and starts stomping everybody in tennis is a terrible as a man. And then it became a woman who was one of the best of the world, but there's no biological difference. Even without a penis, you still stomping on it again is like so funny because once you. It's so funny, like how much this stuff starts undermining their own arguments. Billy Jean King One. Okay. I get that wrong. So I got wrong. The Renee Richard One. Yeah, that's what I could fuse. So, um, what was the.

Speaker 1:          02:50:44       And he was like particularly Gross, right? And Steve Carell plays them really well and movie same Steve Corral who played that crazy guy in that wrestling. He did a really great job with a story. What a crazy story that espn 30 for 30 on the side too. Good man. You know, not a good in the sense that the stories are just such a compelling unbelievable story. Oh my God. Yeah. So when Steve Carell played that character and then you watch the video video, the actual character that like, whoa, like he just nailed that guy. Steve Curls. Incredible talent. He's such a good fucking act to be that funny of a comedian. And that good of a dramatic actor spoken. Pretty incredible. I guess it's comedy though, is always kind of his acting, you know, is like that's his strength and comedy. Like he owned that character, you know. Well Roger Federer said that recently.

Speaker 1:          02:51:30       He got in trouble, right? That the best women. No, it wasn't, it wasn't the older guy. Fuck John McEnroe mock McEnroe said that, and they let us, they let him into it. He said he, he started by saying Serena was the best female player and then they go, why female? Oh, well. And he was like, well, what do you mean I, because I think she's the best female player goes, well, why female? Why not say male egos? Because the men are way better. He was literally just answering the question, started off giving this woman in extraordinary compliment. That was the story I remember. Didn't serina play against an unranked male player? She did. They used to play when they were younger. I think she, she played against some guy that was the story and the guy kicked her ass and everybody was like, what? It just seems to me to be this thing where I kind of look at, obviously we're talking in generalizations here and there are exceptions like, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          02:52:20       Like there are like, you know, uh, a Rhonda Rousey could beat the shit out of me as an example, but it's a bad example, but I'm not a fighter. No, but I'm just making the point that like if you have this stereotype that men are stronger than women or something like that. There are exceptions to the rule if you get. And there are, there are. I still use Ronda Rousey even though she's not championing more, she's just still got that ring to it. Um, but I'm saying there are exceptions to the rule. There are exceptions and, and to treat someone based on a group dynamic is, is ignorant like to. But if you're going to like. I do think there are differences between men and women generally speaking and if you believe that it's like if we're going to celebrate women, I just think it's kind of odd that we have to celebrate the most masculine achievements of women.

Speaker 1:          02:53:02       It's like celebrating them kicking ass. There are these things that I feel like women are superior to men in that I'm very impressed by them. Like I, I just think women. Hold on, let me stop you because you think that running a corporation is masculine, like do you think that being involved in any creative endeavor is masculine? I think that being involved in anything in tech is masculine. Know what they're talking about. Well, I was more responding to the women kick ass. That's just stupid bumper sticker. No, you're right. It is really a group thing is. I think my issue with it was if, if you see things like um, well I just did, but the element I'm responding to is that kick ass to me it just seems to be kind of like a masculine thing. I'm describing that as masculine. Yeah. It was just one silly stupid bumper.

Speaker 1:          02:53:41       Like to say those things, right? Yes. Yes. But I just think there's something about it. It seems to me like the nurturing element of femininity is almost like denigrated and the ass kissy asked kicky element is like his praise where it's like if I'm talking kicking ass and nurture and I'm talking men, verse women in general, just broad speaking like I tend to think of one being male and one being a female, right? To wrap this all up and bring it all day. I think we'd all be better off male women, White, black, Asian, whatever. If we just reasonable nice people, you know, and that's the real problem is that we lock off as we've been discussing all, all day into these camps and we are on camp white male and we are on camp blackmail or camp gay or transgender or camp woman and we just locked into these ideologies and we hate anybody else different and we have these divisive things that we say like all white men are trash unless proven otherwise, you know, like that kind of crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          02:54:39       Like you're, you're setting it up. So the guys like, sorry, sorry. Like you come in, sorry, do it. I didn't do it. Instead of just being a reasonable normal person, but there's not enough reasonable, normal people, so women are constantly dealing with assholes, so they develop these kinds of behavior patterns of behavior. They think about men as being these intrusive, shitty people just want to get in your pants and really don't care about you and they're manipulative and they just want to fuck you. Which when do you say it, I mean that it's somewhat true to describe and then men think of women as being manipulative too. Always looking for the bigger, better deal. You know where they're going to fuck their personal trainer while you're at work and we think about getting divorced and losing all your money because you were too stupid. You didn't sign a prenuptial agreement.

Speaker 1:          02:55:17       She has some kick ass attorney and then you're fucked and we all know guys who have experienced that before too, that she lies about you beating the kids and then she gets full custody. That's all real, but then the good stuff is all real. To know what I mean. It's real and that does happen, but then there's also like the chick who just like gives a guy like, you know, like the security and competence. He never had to go be great. There's the guy who does support his chick through like her endeavors and like, you know, it's like, it's like you got it, you know, it's like, it's like that shouldn't in the hurricane in Houston. Kind of put some perspective on that for me where it's like, you know, it's like you see just like all these people, it's like Antifa versus Nazis as the state of the country and then you see like this, this horrible hurricane happened and just the acts of kindness after, when you see these people, like, like young guys, like, like these group of like 20 year olds maybe they were, I saw took.

Speaker 1:          02:56:01       They're like, they're like a motor boats down to Houston and are pulling old people out of their homes and you're like, God damn it, motherfucker. Like that's our country too, you know? And like, like it, it's all like the Nazis are our country too. But that guys, our country, that is also as people responding to a very real problem, we're really unites people. They feel like they have to help each other because it's a weird problem. Most of the time we're separated from each other by buildings and cars and there's this weird alienation we have with one another. It's one of the reasons why places of high density you get much more liberal ideologies or liberal in terms of accepting, I should say, not necessarily conservative, but there's a lot of that to a democratic versus conservative or left wing versus conservative. But these big population culture is people interact with each other more.

Speaker 1:          02:56:44       You know, you don't get the same kind of racism, you know, you get less and it's less accepted I think in like maybe say New York City and probably anywhere because in New York City, especially in Manhattan, everybody's got to interact. Not saying you don't encounter it. You certainly do sides. White racism, black racism. You're gonna encounter racism, pizza flaw in human nature. That's the same thing that we're talking about with the assholes of the Tiki torches. It's a flaw. Everyone likes to feel like they're the best and my team is the best at my local bar is the best and my aunt makes the best chili towns and it's like, no, your aunt does not make the world's Best Chili. That's fucking ridiculous. It's, it's, you know, the odds are very against it. Let's just say it's a very, very low chance to prove it, but people. Right. But people want to feel that way and so there will always be these certain kinds of in group preference things where there's.

Speaker 1:          02:57:31       But like you said, there are. I do think like growing up in New York City, you also just see, and this is the beautiful thing that we fucking lost in America. That sucks, but it's like freedom does fucking bring people together and capitalism, even though it's become a dirty word, like all that shit brings people together, man. Like I'm a Jew and I can go in a New York City Street and put my hand out and like a Muslim guy comes and picks me up and drops me off at home and just use uber. Do you wasting your time with all that? I mean, to be honest, I really do use Uber, but Uber, I uh, I was doing lyft and now I just switched over to uber. Do you feel bad that Uber was getting locked out of London? Like I'm going to step up and help out uber?

Speaker 1:          02:58:07       I don't know about that. I knew they're locked out of Austin. I think Austin, Austin, Texas, they left there. I think they're locked out of London now. I think the marriage you said that the way they operate socks fuck off. Well, I do. I love anything that undermines government monopoly. So I thought that was great that they undermined that home medallion thing. I think it's like, I think technology that undermines the government is the most beautiful thing ever. As you know, that ways app, uh, they, they have that now in New York City. They'll tell you if there's a camera on the next red light, they'll tell you if there's a cop on the highway waiting the check, you know, like there'll be like police ahead. So there's literally the system where the cops, cops will sit there and wait for someone to come, you know, speeding so they can come, you know, extort you for some money and understand how that works.

Speaker 1:          02:58:48       The waste thing that it's just people calling in. So cops calling fake cars. I did not know that, but I know that I knew that it was other people calling in very upset because the police officers actually call in fake cop on the side of the road calls. But. So what is that doing? Making people drive the speed limit. Fucks it up. It's a car. It's crying wolf. So you basically just don't believe it as much anymore. It's interesting. But I thought there was something really beautiful about that server protect. I get to know. I mean that's the third thing. Protect and rule and take you out. Yeah. But I, I thought when they first did it, what a beautiful thing that you're going. Because look, if you, if you, uh, if you tell them there's a cop ahead, what you're going to do is make sure you're not speeding.

Speaker 1:          02:59:27       I mean that's the only trick. So essentially it's doing what you would claim the law wants you to do. It's just doing it in a way where the state doesn't fucking extort, you know, of course. So then they'll start going out, we've got to fuck with that. I did not let that work. Yeah. They'll eventually figure out a way around that or we're going to get to a point I think in our lifetimes where it's impossible to lie. I think that's where it's headed and I think that's gonna solve a lot of our issues socially, a lot of very. She's politically, we're going to understand motivations behind things in a way like maybe motivations will seem color coded. That is when someone's envious, you literally see green with some new program. We're all running. I think what you're sit like, we've already started to see it and it's like it's much, much harder.

Speaker 1:          03:00:05       I think that it's much, much harder for people to pull off lying. It was much harder for Hillary Clinton to pull off then for traditional politics in the past because they're leaking everything online now and it's just harder for the government or the big corporations have the media to convince you of this narrative. It's getting harder and harder, like we haven't figured out exactly how to move it in a good direction, but like it is. You see the control that they have being undermined. The control of the mainstream media is being undermined. The control of certain universities. What's already gone. The, the Internet has sort of eroded all the control of mainstream media. CNN is now called fake news a million times a day all throughout the country. And you look at these people constantly calling. The president calls it fake. That's fucking CNN. Oh, that's right.

Speaker 1:          03:00:46       And then you say like a w when you said it earlier in the show with Fox News had had a monopoly on right wing news. Well that's fucking over. When you look at the bench, Shapiro comes and shows. Look at the numbers. That thing does. I mean it's like, oh yeah. Fox News as a big competitor on their, on their hands now and all these other guys at crowder and all these guys were like huge and all of the. If you look at like and Jordan who's more, you know, like he calls himself a classic British liberal and it looks at it that way, which is like a sort of a different definition. It's more of a pragmatic sort of more conservative pragmatic, probably closest to what is called Libertarian in the American School of thought. The classical liberal people in disingenuously call him outright. It's just so freaking ridiculous. But this is the thing where it's like everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders is a Nazi.

Speaker 1:          03:01:33       It's like there's just these words don't even mean anything and he just installed so it's like people shouting in your face and it's like Lion Hillary, like that kind of thing. But you take the most fucked up word you can think of to justify the legal position. And then culturally you say, oh by the way, that word applies to everything. It's like women are getting raped on college campus, so we get the law passed. Well, that's one of the real problems with the guy like Donald Donald trump said, when he boils things down to these slogans, then they boil things down to slogans in return and we just have a fucking fight. Were you throwing rocks at each other? That was one of the amazing things about trump and the moment is that trump comes out, he's like this simplistic buffoon, and in every in the normal mind you're like, well, at some point he's going to meet a a professional who will embarrass him and then you start to realize after a while I was like, oh, there's just no professional plans.

Speaker 1:          03:02:18       Neither did Hillary Clinton. They were all. They were all completely empty. The difference between him versus Hillary versus what we just had with Mitt Romney versus Obama to really reasonable well spoken people who are accomplished and quite intelligent, and while the one of them believes that nonsense, I don't know which one. They both believe in nonsense. Right? But one of them believes in like one of those magical underwear at a presidential debate with them. Yeah, he has to. Or it goes straight to like a cabin in hell. You have to stay there with no satellite TV. I don't know what the rule is. You only get to have your wives that we sling back. I hope we have this blow back this way and I hope I don't mean I don't know who's going to emerge between now and 20 slash 20, but it's gonna have to be someone that's interesting, right?

Speaker 1:          03:03:05       What's going to be have to be someone that we look at and go, okay, this is a viable alternative to what we're currently dealing with and they probably shouldn't say shit for a long time. They should probably just build up and prepare and just constantly say I'm not running. I'm not running. I don't know man. I don't know if there's any bringing this thing back together. The United States of America. I think we might be going our separate ways in the future. I just think we might be headed toward some type of Soviet style breakup. Like, like where some of the countries still exist, but we're not all a part of the same thing. I just, I look, I look at these two trends that I see happening, right? And one is that content, and this to me is the biggest moral issue of our time, but the continued growth of the state, which is just like gets like we live under choice happens just like a corporation, universal growth. They want to get bigger and stronger every year pretty much always seems to happen. I mean, and that government, unlike, like corporations always want

Speaker 3:          03:03:58       to grow, a lot of them go out of business but they always want to get bigger governments, uh, they can force you to pay them. So it's a lot easier for them to grow. And this is our most advanced society. Start as, you know, a constitution with a somewhat limited government and then it grows. And that was the big appeal of trump. The only appeal drain the swamp. This is what it was then. And a lot of it was, you know, some of it was, was good. The idea of draining the swamp is good and not fighting these wars anymore I think is really great. But you know, you have this thing where we, we live under the biggest government, most powerful government in the history of the world. I mean, there's never been a government that spends $4,000,000,000,000 that can drone bomb anyone on the planet.

Speaker 3:          03:04:34       That's, you know, we, we have bases all over the world, hundreds of different countries or at least well over 100 and everything is going up. I mean every budget, you know, Bush spent the most effort then Obama spent the most ever trump will outspend Obama, no question about it. And all of the major major problems that I see are our direct result of this. Like the longest wars in American history, the mass incarceration rate spying on all of our citizens record debt. You know, like all of these things are a result of government being way too big and way too out of control. And then at the same time, while we're like spending ourselves too far into debt way to extended militarily, the culture is also completely decaying. And we're more at war with each other than we've ever been. And like I said before we go from like, you know, a Buckley Vidal debate to trump Clinton like this.

Speaker 3:          03:05:22       We've had a jerry springer culture and now we've got a jerry springer president to go with it and I just see this culture breaking up. The government getting too big. I don't know how this all works out so that like we're all friends again. But I'd love for someone to maybe spoken like a true white man. Great privilege gave. We got to wrap this up. Thank you very much. So can I plug my on, just put a new comedy special. So I just wanted to mention that he just put out my, uh, my debut comedy special.
