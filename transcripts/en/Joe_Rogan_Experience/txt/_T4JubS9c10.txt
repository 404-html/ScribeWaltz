Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Did you see this? And we're back. Trump's latest conspiracy. You know, what is it? He's, I guess he's saying that there's a New York Times piece that contains a paragraph saying, trump suggested that the access hollywood tape wasn't real. So he's like saying that never existed. Oh No. You know, he said, well, I think those are the two microphones on or something. So I was up, the TV was on. So it, it's, um, I think he said like in passing to someone, like how do we even know? That's real, dude. Do you know how tired he must be? I'm so tired. Just listen. Just think how tired you are, right? Just doing normal stuff. Doing podcast, dual comedy shows, you know, having a girlfriend, right? Tiring. Imagine being 70 and being the fucking president and being in a position where you're like, why did I do this?

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Why did I do this? He's got, I mean, maybe, maybe let's just give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you went into this job with the best of intentions, but it was just overwhelmed by conflict. Every step of the way. He's tested in a way that his character was never tested before and all these people are mad at them. It's just hell, hell on earth. 70 so tired and he's getting the worst comments ever have. He did like this tired. But here's the thing. There was an article that was written, not married men not meaning in any way to disparage the great president of ours, but there was a article that was written, um, a while back that were this guy found out that trump had some sort of a prescription for an fentimans like way back in the day, which again, that word's a dirty word, but let's just break down what that means.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       It's a series and a class of drugs that's a stimulant and there's a lot of people that use stimulants, including me. I love coffee. I drink these caveman Nitros for a lot of people. This might as well be a drug, just 270 milligrams. This little can, 270 milligrams of caffeine. So I'm a hypocrite. I try not to be at least. So I'm just being honest. It's nothing wrong with stimulants. I enjoy coffee, but that's the only one that I fuck with other than that new vigil. I've tried that stuff a few times and I will try it. Like say if I have to drive home, if driving home from San Francisco, it's like 10 o'clock at night and know I'm not going to get home until three in the morning, four in the morning, I will take one of those cause it'll keep you from falling asleep.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       That's what it's made for. Yes. It's not high. Apparently what I've read was that it, that's what they prescribe it for, but it would, it's made for the guy and it was originally called pro vigil. Right? It's two different ones, but they're pretty much the same. Yeah. But one of them's a new one. Think new vigils. A new one. Right. And I think what they did is like, there was probably some sort of a, I don't know, one of maybe maybe it's an improvement or maybe it was some sort of a copyright thing or a trademark thing. I'm going to ask Jamie that. Google a bunch of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       What did we start with? Start with the trump, uh, amphetamine thing. But here's the thing, that's what adderall is folks. And I know a fucking shit load of people that are on that stuff and I've talked about it ad nauseum. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I just, just for people that have never heard me talk about this, you got to get it out. Fun Fact. 19. Excuse me. I said, I think it came from this tweet is which is guy that was a contributing writer for Vanity Fair. Yeah. Kurt, I can walk, I believe is the way you say his last name. I says fun fact. In 1982 s trump started taking amphetamine derivatives. He says abused them, but that's, that's his classification, right? Only supposed to take two for 25 days. Stayed on for eight years. Really?

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       The second tweet, where were the one below? It says wives. White House admitted to edit to me. He took it for a short amount of time for a diet.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       Oh, a diet. When he was not overweight, I counted with med records. They cut me off. People misreading dread was drug was though propane, 75 milligrams a day. Prescriptions filled at Duane reed on 57 wow. Not that I know things. He gave out the fucking address of the Duane Reed where it was prescribed or fulfilled. Yeah, man, I think I'm for sure. Without a doubt. Right? Like there's a lot of people that enjoy some stimulants. Can you see him now

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       getting tan his tan on and get taking diet pills?

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       Like that's, that's how you get, that's how you get ahead and this is gonna sound fucked up and it's not entirely true. Okay. This is why it sounds fucked up because other people have done it with nothing. There's people out there that are just fucking getting up early and run in mountains and drinking water and kicking ass. There are people like that, but there's a lot of people in business in a lot of different walks of life that enjoy stimulants and I am not knocking them. I just don't want to be really clear about this. This is just sort of a discussion of it. I'm not knocking him. Maybe it's awesome. I'm scared of adderall. I'm scared. I'd love it.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       I, I've tasted it. It tastes like, I mean, I've had it, you know what it reminded me of, I tried to do it once. My friend gave me one and I took half of the wine and I went on stage like later and it felt like I was on coke, like in the, you know, like if you tried to do coke on, uh, before you do comedy, your timing's off. You know, you start like you're just going through your shit super fast. And that's what I felt like. And I'm like, I'm never doing that again. And then I had it one more time, like years later, uh, when I was doing something, I had to stay awake and I just felt jittery. Like I, I didn't like it compared to like nuvigil where you didn't have like the jitters or the, the adderall type feeling

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       nuvigil doesn't give you any of that, right? Yeah, you're just on. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird, but it doesn't, um, it doesn't, you don't feel like it stimulates you. I feel like it just doesn't, that keeps you out of level, but it doesn't take any heart. Jesus sounds like a new vigil. Add this, this, this shit is. So this is the thing about new vigil. I had a conversation with Tim Ferris about this, you know Tim Ferriss didn't put that in one of his biohacking books specifically because he felt like if he did, people would eat it like candy and I went holy Shit. Like when on a guy like Tim Ferriss, extremely influential guy that spends a lot of time doing like biohacking and improvement shit like he does for that guy to say he didn't want to write about new vigil or pro vigil at a book because he didn't want people eating it like candy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       Like Holy Shit. Listen to him. And one of the things that he said that I thought was very important, he said there's no biological free lunch. So there's gotta be some sort of repercussions for taking that. And maybe we won't know for 20 years. Right. That's the thing, like something's happening, right? You're doing something. If it gets you fired up now it's not a natural thing. So it's not like you're taking vitamins and those vitamins like b 12 or something like that stimulates you. It gives you energy. It's not that, okay, so is it bad that it's not that is it bad or cat? How much, how many chemicals are bad and how many chemicals are okay and how do you know? I mean

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       look at sugar man. W we we are now learning a sugar is like the worst thing in the whole entire world because of the sugar industry. And back in the day was like sell this, sell this fats bad, you know, and him and now we know that sugar is one of the biggest things for heart disease and all that crap and the, they're weasels. What'd you pull up? The comparison chart on new vaginal and provigil. They're almost the same thing. One is modafinil and the other one is our modafinil. And so they have some sort of a here. The mechanism of action is slightly different on them. That's the only thing I can tell. It's different.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Is One an improvement of the other eye

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       can't really looks at new bridges, has slightly different functions to shit. Yeah. It's something about electronic couple anyway. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       The fact that I've taken this, no, they'll listen to what this is. This stuff is, it may activate orexin peptides via stimulation of Orexin receptors. Oh x one and x two and may also increase. Ready for this one glue to glue to Metta. Metallurgic Gluten, Matt Dirge, Dick [inaudible], Gouda muttered chick. Is that I say it and it sounds right. Glutamatergic concentrations decrease ga be allergic activation and increase electronic coupling. I who knows what that means. Rhonda. Patrick. Well she, she probably would have to go. Okay. And then she to like lay it out and then we would listen to it afterwards. Like, oh, whenever she talks, I always feel like I'm some sort of like a a stupid monkey person. I'm like stupid monkey of question for smart

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       lady. Please tell me how the body works. What is electronic coupling that we've got to get to the bottom of that cause that's electronic. That's a problem. How do we have something electronic in us? How was like a thing? You have to worry about what you're trying to stay awake. What is it the fuck? We're robots, dude. Magic. That's how we found out by looking at the ingredients of new vigil and were like, Hey, hey, hey, what does this mean? Then all of a sudden the fucking overlords turned the switch and we can see them in front of us. Sorry, you guys are robots. Because his entire time was that God damn ad agency the whole time that let it out. We're doing the bid

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       bidding for the robot world. You know what the creepiest fucking quote I ever read it was um, uh, God, Marshall Mcluhan, he said human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. I want, what the fuck man. And he wrote this Mcluhan was a bad motherfucker and like our one of a really underrated visionary, like you read some of the stuff, you're like, Jesus. Like this guy had some insight and I'm pretty sure he wrote all this stuff in like the 60s you know, think of what, find it, see if he could find when that quote was said by Mcluhan or written however it was, human beings or the sex organs of the machine world. I feel like it was in the 60s you wrote this,

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       which is like, wow, that's so how the fuck did he see that?

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       That's what it is. We are some sort of a, a weird being that makes better and better technology every year and we'd get pumped about it. Which is why I wanted to show you that

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       razor phone. Oh, that's so sexy, man. I can't believe you have that. 1964 64 just stop and think of that. 1964 that motherfucker figured it out. That was all kind of mine. Probably was covered is that, that's like, so look at that. Look at that. Bright. That's beautiful man. It's just the razor phone that's supposed to have the best speaker phone do to speakers and saying, yeah, like it's like a bluetooth. It's not that loud. Not that loud. It's not as loud as a bluetooth, but it's fucking crazy. Like you watch a movie on it, it's dope. You can play games on it. It's incredible. Yeah. Sounds like God damn ad for this now. Nuvigil and raised. No, no one's paid me. This is a, they gave it to me for free and all uh, all honesty, but it's pretty dope razor mixed quality products.

Speaker 3:          00:11:10       I have that big high end or high end laptop, but the blade pro and it's really good. Is that the iphone 10 I did. I just got the iphone tench yeah, it took me, I gave in, I saw Jamie is, I'm like, I give, I tapped two things about it that I liked. Good face id, a hundred percent legit, hundred percent legit. The only time it's like when you wake up, you know you've pillows like in the way or your eyes are puffy down but you just go to the passcode. But anytime you look at it, it just unlocks, you know, you can close your eyes and it won't unlock. So when you're sleeping you can't like just put that up to your face and the size of it. Cause it's the same about the same size as the the plus, which is what I told that bitch.

Speaker 3:          00:11:50       But it's like having an old small phone again. So I was starting to get carpal tunnel and my and my finger and my thumb from the plus after awhile. So you can just swipe up and I can get to all of your, um, I got to all your notifications. Yeah. There's, there's different swipe systems. It shouldn't say anything other than notification though. Does he looks at it. Oh Shit. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one of that. Let me back and I was trying to cancel it doesn't trust me. Cancer Pitch Dilly Dally and won't let me cancel it. It's making me enter a password. Cancel. Oh there it is. Here's some notifications. Now can you see anything? Cause I'm already, nobody wants to fake face Id. Look at me. Look at that will look, I'll unlock it for you.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       That's why. Hold on. Perfect. Perfect example. So it fucks up sometimes. Sometimes, but I'll tell you what man, this a, the form factor is very interesting. That's my security camp. So it's a huge ass camera, but it's not second three or four cameras I think. I mean it's the shoe as huge as phone rather, but it's not a huge ass phone. Right. And it has a killer camera. What a weird world man. Just 10 years ago the first iphone came out and if you saw that thing today, but that thing was made out of wood. I still have mine. Do you have some amazing all mine and two of them are starting to explode like, and it's not fair because I bought him and I wanted to keep them like a collector, but my like iphone three is like bubbled up and it's about to blow up any day now.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       So do you get used to all this difference? You have different swipes now because you don't have a homepage. Like how do you, you have to shut it down to get out of there. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. If the swiping system actually is very like, I can't believe I used to do it that different way. Like if you want to go in between like, uh, like programs now you just go to the on the bottom left or right. You know, so you do that and then now the top right, it gets you to the control center. And I mean, and it took me about two days for me to finally go, oh, this is so much how it's supposed to be. Yeah. Well yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:58       Who's figure, you know, like if they figure out a better way, even though it's a better way, like, you know, cordy typing, do you know the whole deal behind that? Apparently this is not the fastest way to type like the keyboard Qwerty is set up the way it is because in the olden days they made it that way because old keys would get stuck on each other and they would mash them and they get stuck together. So they had a separate, the more commonly used keys. So they changed the way they did it, but the right way to do the typewriter, goddammit, I forget the name of it, but uh, some people try wacky fucking nerds. You wacky nerds, these wacky nerds, they touch it. They take their keyboards and they reprogrammed them or they buy a specific keyboard that's in this way and then they learn how to type with this super unusual keyboard, but it's supposed to be fast.

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       Sure. Here's a plug in. I think that you can do it on your ipad and your iphones and stuff like that. They'll realize it. Like, what is it called James? The devora Kita for act. That's, yeah, it's

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       a little different layout. Yeah. So there's cordy and Devorah. So yeah, like it's a e U I d h. So it's not corny at all. P Y F, G, C R L on top. Like what? Like you would, it would take a long ass time to relearn.

Speaker 3:          00:15:08       You can't relearn. You'd have to start from the beginning. I don't know, man. I don't think it's worth it. He just, I just, I'm too stupid. I'm too stupid. It's like my thoughts about learning a new language. Like, well I'm good voice, right? Your students so much already there that we're not going to have keyboards very soon anyways. What have you heard about those google ear buds that you put them in and you, they translate for you in real time? Uh, my friend has him there. They, they, they, they're not good. I wasn't thinking like how could they be good when people have like crazy flow to their language. Like, you know, you talked to like some serious Puerto Ricans and like there's like all these words are like flowing into these other words, you know, I mean there's like a flavor to it that I just don't think that little computer thing is going to be able to figure out what the fuck that guy just said. You know, I think you could get already do it in Google, you know, so you don't, you don't need the headphones and you just need your phone. So I think in here it just does it on speaker phone. Okay. The new Pixel, by the way, that camera on that, the best camera of any, any phone, the new pixel two. It's crazy is it's a single camera where all these other phones are doing it with a dual camera. It is interesting,

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       you know, um, what's really interesting is the level that all these phones are at now, it's, everything is at a super high level. Like technologically speaking, the jump has been giant. It's like where is this fucking thing going? Like where, where are we going to look at for the iphone 20, you know, I mean is it going to be in your skin,

Speaker 3:          00:16:38       get it? Is it going to be aware of blindness? It's going to be wearable. I think one day there's not going to be a device, a phone. You're just going to be wearing it somehow. Like you look at your sleeve to make a phone call. You can check your email. You're using your shoe to some mad scientist is going to figure out a way to make it

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       eyeballs that work better than our eyeballs and they'll go, we're going to swap out our eyeballs. They're going to be the first to go and swap out your eyeballs for these super electronic eyeballs. But everything is like a shade of color off like red is purple. They got to get it. It's like one of them old led screens and he's got burned in like we're going to get, we're going to figure it out. But right now you just give up your eyes, you give up your eyes for the computer world. That's how it start us off to start us off with better eyes. First it'd be our blind friends, uh, pro, uh, blind friends. We'll get new eyes and they're like, dude, I see so much better. I'm actually happy that I went blind. Like, what the fuck did you just say? And then next thing you know, you're going to try it. There's going to be some someone, some crazy fucker with good eyesight is going to go, I want to be able to see better. It's like the girl with a perfect body that gets boob implants like, no, how'd you do that? You know, the girl already has double d's and goes to like AAA. He like, no, no, no,

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Why did you do that? It's interesting. It's interesting to think of like all the blind people would be the first ones to get all the new eyeballs and be seeing better. So they're all going to be like those people with the glasses, the blind people, and they take off their, and they're all robots like they live with the movie they live. Remember that Rowdy Roddy Piper recipes, respect. Remember when Rowdy Roddy Piper was a movie star for a little bit doing some action movies and he was like one of the first guys like the rock to break through, you know, and uh, that day live movie. That was fun. I miss that guy, dude. This is, it's a real possibility that this could happen. Like this is not a, I mean, I'm not saying it's going to happen in, in a decade, but if human beings live to be another hundred years, we're going to find they're going to have better replacements to tweet about that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       A robot was scared. Everybody just the way he worded it, he said, this is nothing in a few years, that Bot will move so fast. You need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams. Oh fuck that guy. So awesome. The shit out of me. But he's right. Listen man, he's probably one of the smartest human beings on the planet earth that guys, you know that they think he might have invented bitcoin. There's a lot of speculation online. You know what? Here's the thing, I want to talk about this and this podcast. I didn't even read the article. I looked at the headline, I'm like probably, and I kept moving. He started paypal, right? I didn't hit him like Peter Teal started paying. Yeah, I believe so. I believe that's what like made him and there was a video of him from like the 1990s where he got like a million dollar car delivered.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       Like it was just starting to ball and he's just starting to ball out of control. He's probably like one of the smartest human beings ever. And he sports car though. There's Tesla. He's a fascinating guy, man. Do you know? He just like made a whole town out of like a battery, like a term. He made like the biggest battery in the history of the world. Did you hear about that one? Yeah. They just isn't some new thing that he just built. They just built the largest battery in the history of the world. It's like a building. Like this guy is fucking Nikola Tesla. We're going to be some madman. We're going to have battery explosions in the future. That's going to be a big thing for sure. Now, right? Like this whole town's going to go up. A Tesla has built the world's largest battery in Australia. What in the fuck tech and Leon Musk. Elon. Elon musk is making good on his promise to solve energy, an energy crisis in Australia. Can you make that bear

Speaker 4:          00:20:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       Besides, um, screw that up. Oh, here it goes. It's fully installed. The world's largest lithium ion battery in South Australia. The state government said in a statement Thursday, Tesla teamed up with a French renewable energy from and a local government to install the battery, which must promise to deliver within a hundred days of signing the contract or it would be free. He's crazy, but he did as a crisis. He's, he's a mad man. He's like, I'm fucking mad scientist from a, he's like a guy from a movie, right? Like if you had a movie and there was some mad billionaire Robert Downey junior type character that just kept invented the newest crazy shit and was at the cutting edge of science and was telling everybody to look out for the fucking robots are going to kill us. It would be Elon Musk and let him know the comedy show one night.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       I was panicking. He watched you though, right? I think he, I think he did. He had a nice army with them. Yeah. I bring a lot of money with guns can move very good. Especially if you're worried about robots. Fuck man. He's right though. That's the scary thing. When you watch that one robot, there's one mini robot is this little yellow one in this video and it's running on the ground and like a very fast rate and you're like, wait, wait, wait. Like you're trying to wrap your head around this thing. Like what is this thing has guns? What? It's got a little camera and it's got guns and it's running at you like this and it's like the size of a 44 magnum. It's like a series of 44 magnums pointed at you. It's about that big and it's running. I'll go a hundred times faster than you could ever run.

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       Like what? Oh God. This is like probably how people in Yemen feel like, yes, I've been telling you you can't, you can't let them use robots. You know like the people that get bombed with drones, we've just sorta like, that's not real. You don't even have to Blake, tell us about it. No one has to tell us that they're going to do it. They just do it right. And something like 80% of the people that they kill her innocent. There's some crazy number of people that the drones of Kilt, I know we've gone over this before. What is it like 80% do you remember?

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       That sounds about right. It's some, let's see if we can find it. Just cause it's so, I know you're a guru. Can you were in surgery to get it probably might be like 78% whatever it is, but it's even if it's more than 50% that's fucking crazy. We just have robots that shoot things at people and we hope we get the right ones. You would never think that transformers like what actually happened one day we're going to have like good transformers and bad transformers. Good ones are going to hack the badger ones or vice versa. Michael Bay was right all along. God, we need to bring Megan Fox back into the franchise. What I just, that's hard to imagine man, but it's probably inevitable, right? It's probably inevitable that someone is going to make some super smart robot that does his bidding and this and we're going to have like a war of worlds and we're going to have robo cops fight the bad robots.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       Drones. You imagine if the argument would be let's let the robots fight because therefore it'll save human lives will dictate how the world is one sort of just like the Olympics but with robots fighting to the death to see who gets to run the world. I'm like Elon must, should be doing instead of making batteries is trying to invent force fields. You know like for real we need on the personal force fields, we'll see he's, this is the thing, he is at the cutting edge of science and in terms of like implementation of all these new inventions like lithium ion batteries that are hooked up to a giant fucking

Speaker 5:          00:23:56       whatever that structure was committed. Then drone raise this one on Espn all the time they pee do to put on like a almost a Vr headset and race through it. They did have him in arenas. It's crazy. A lot of times it's at night with lit up like neon obstacles they're going to go through and you'd be like 70 miles an hour. I think they go really fast. So cool. That's incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       That's so much cooler than a video game. Cause this is an actual thing out there that you're moving around, you know like to play a video game. Like that's the new video game. The new video game is you put some like 10 k camera Vr headset thing on and you put these cameras on these robots and then you go do shit where the actual thing is really doing it. It's not valid. It's not a video. You're just watching some real physical thing take place. And then you have these physical wars. So like instead of, you know like if you built together an army of semi indestructable robots, right? And you had to duke it out with another army of semi indestructable robots and that would be like a television show or drone laser tag where it's like star wars and you're fighting and if you have you shoot your laser at it, like turns off the drone.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       It doesn't destroy it. Maybe it makes it fake. Yeah, but you'd have to have high stakes. See, I think things would be so cheap back by the time it gets to this point. It's like everything gets cheaper and cheaper. Like you used to be, like you had to be a super baller to have that Michael Douglas brick on the beach. Right? Remember when the movie greed or whatever it was, Wall Street greed is good. He's walking with that giant brick. Like you had to be a super ball or to be able to afford that. But now that's like nothing and everyone has a cell phone that's way better than that. Like every person walking down the street you can serve. Do you have a fallen on you? Yes, I do. And he pulls out his phone. It's way better than Michael Douglas's. Super baller all time. High money guy cell phone here except ours. But Ari, he hasn't said No. Ari's phone, it's still way better. Right? It's still way better than that stupid piece of shit that Michael Douglas had. So if we just keep going in that direction, they're going to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper to do crazier and crazier things.

Speaker 5:          00:26:02       You remember this movie that came out a few years ago with Hugh Jackman? Oh yeah, they had fights. What is it? It's called real steel. It's like rock 'em sock. 'Em robots. How did they, how did they, uh, did they do it with like remote control where almost like what you're describing, there's some capturing their body movement and that just re like copies what they do. And really it also is ai and has feelings. I don't know how dumb was it? Wait a minute. He's on the ground. How's he fighting? Was it someone else doing it and then he's going to go back in there. Oh God, he did the thing with the,

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       oh no, he's going to, is it training? Montage. Stop this. Don't you rode Wolverine Jolt. You root for, don't you ruin Wolverine from me? You piece of shit. Sorry. I got dumped in that look. Oh, that's so sad. He's going to show the little boy, the little boy and tells him, Hey, come on man. You gotta get in there and when for us it pulls the sunglasses down. Well, I'm going to have to start training, which I took it. Did Anybody Watch that movie? I don't know. That's why I don't, don't know much about it. They must've gave him Hugh Jackman. Oh Shit. A lot of money to make that look like a good idea. He had to be sitting in his house in Australia. Going, how? When? How much again? How much? Okay, okay, so I'm a fighter robot guy. Is that what's going on? How many weeks?

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       I watched it on an airplane. No sound. That's about it. That's what you do when you're so high. You're thinking you got to fall out of the sky. They'd watch that and go, what? That guy's awesome as wolverine. Even though he's not supposed to like is not supposed to look like that. Wolverines not supposed to be a big guy. That would be like a bear hug. We'll run. It's like a little little blockhead guy. Wolverine would be built like um, you'd have to go like who? Samar Paul Horez. Perfect example. Who some are. Paul Harris is a guy who fought in the UFC. He got, he got kicked out of the UFC for I think unjustly. He's got it. He's, he holds on to submissions too long and people get really mad at him cause he fucking mangles people's legs. But I think the last one, like east the people are they out there on him so hard that I think the last one was just, it was a tiny minor infraction.

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       I think he's just get super excited and I think he's definitely held on to things too long in the past, but I think he's learned from that. But anyway, the UFC as a zero tolerance policy for that shit. He doesn't fight for the UFC anymore. I get it. But my point is the guy looked like wolverine from the comic book. He's just fucking jacked. He was like this five foot eight, five foot nine. He might not even been that tall, hundred 85 pound goal. Willa just ripping people's legs apart. He was one of the scariest guys hour. See if he can find a good picture of who some are. Paul Hi-rez just try Pahara it's, there's no way I'm spelling who some are correctly. It's who some are within our reach in my area. Yeah. It's, it's spelled with an r, but the, the porch. A gay, see, please use, uh, these h they call me Joe Hogan.

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       Joe Hogan. There he is right there. Jesus Christ, man. Wow. Look at that fucking picture. We kind of jacked. He is, man. That's what wolverine is supposed to look like, if the almost exactly like that. Just so like super jacked pit bull of a man, because that's what a wolverine is. A wolverine. It's a crazy fucking animal. He's still fighting to get the size of that guy is, he's still fight. He got fucked up a few times and some other organizations, he got beaten by some tough guys. Like a meal, meat meal. A meal. Meek. Sorry, I'm saying his name wrong. Amil Meek,

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       the mad viking dude. He fucked him up and that, that's what got him over into the UFC.

Speaker 6:          00:29:51       That's like a Gi Joe Body. Yeah. Yeah. He's ridiculous. Um, but that's what if like wolverine was a human, that's what he'd looked like. Wouldn't look like Hugh Jackman but you Jackman pulls it off. Like you don't have to be totally, I'm can you kind of get a movie star in there? It's not like let Paul Horez play Wolverine. Like Wolverine has to say a bunch of Shit and you got to believe you means it, you know? So it was probably hard to find like a super jacked movie star who could be a savage unless it's jack man who jacqueline could be a savage. I'm buying it. I got my t levels results today. How's everything going? I don't know what it means, but I'm in the normal range. Like here's the, that there's like the normal range. You have a chart. We had a doctor I just spent, I spent, I use this every, well every well thing and he spit in his little thing and like two weeks you'd get like full graph.

Speaker 6:          00:30:43       That's like 24 and me. But for you and 24 it's 24 hours. But like I showed you, like I, I'm on the low side of normal, but so I don't even know what that means. And I guess I should test it every couple of months to see if it bounces up and down. But I definitely have lower normal. Well, you could fix that. I know I, but here's the thing you should do. Like if you, you really, you really like we have in a conversation about health. No, I mean I'm just checking my t levels, bro. I know, bro. It's all connected. What I'm saying is that I guarantee you if you just changed your diet, it would have a significant effect on that just changed your diet. I'm going to go to, I'm going to do this new thing. If you want to do it with me all through December, December, discipline, this is what I'm gonna do. I'm going to work out five days a week at least. Minimum. I owe five days a week. No bread, no wheat, no pasta, no sugar. All month. Two drinks a week. Geez, that's it.

Speaker 7:          00:31:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       So if you go out, have a drink wine, you get one more of those in a week. So what are you going to eat? Mostly just stake healthy food, man. I watched another week document or on the plane, shit, my fucking pants. I was terrified. It was talking about the stuff that's in roundup and how it's only supposed to affect bacteria and they're the scientists in this documentary like, yeah, but you have bacteria in your gut. Like they're not taking that into consideration. They're not taking into consideration gut flora. And they were talking about how many people are having issues because they're eating bread that has pesticides on. I'm like, okay, is this like some pseudoscience shit? Is this some nonsense? Like I got to get to it and eventually I will, but I can't imagine that stuff that kills bacteria would be good for you. I just can't imagine. I don't know how much of that you would actually wind up having in your body, but how the fuck could that be good for you?

Speaker 1:          00:32:38       Like all that roundup that's, that should scare the fuck out of you. What is going on there? Man, you know, I, we sure we share. That's okay. For you, like one of those things, there's a certain amount that's allowable per probably, but who set that standard and is that standard been updated based on what you know, like there's too much money involved in all this stuff. You have to realize like anything that's going to slow down the money when it comes to in his old bro, you couldn't talk and conspiracies. But no, like for real, this is important when it comes to environmental regulations. If you look at the fight, here's a Ryko super good point. When it comes to this, if you look at the fight when it comes to environmental regulations, who the fuck would be arguing against preserving the environment to stop, stop and think about how crazy these conversations have to be where someone saying, Hey, no, you can't dig that oil well right next to this river because it'll kill everything in the river.

Speaker 1:          00:33:37       You fucking cunts. And the people still wind up doing it somehow. Like how it, how is that conversation even taking place that we're, we're in, we're getting involved in doing things that we know for sure is going to have some consequence and we're willing to accept a certain amount of it. Some consequence on the natural world around it might, you might just the keystone pipeline, just, just the other day release 200,000 gallons of oil a little bit. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Whoops. House bill. Want to fix? This is what we're trying to fix this thing. Whoa. Like we should be like before we agree to anything, right? I guess, I guess there's gotta be some trade off, right? If you want to do a big city and you want to have all this power, like there's gotta be some sort of environmental consequences at this stage of the life.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       Is that at this stage of, of people like the way we're running things and has elan musk can make us those big ass batteries everywhere. It's solar power collectors, man. Like, like lh. Every building should be required to have solar collectors on them in la. No Shit. And it's not that crazy expensive, like it's not that you could do it yourself on Amazon prime, prime dropping, that's for sure. It's dropping. You know, they make some things where you can like charge your phone. Like they make these a solar panels. Like you could sit them out on your patio. It collects a electricity enough to you take it with you the next day. You could charge your phone with it, you charge your laptop with it. They like backpacks that have solar on it. She got to be like, why the sunniest places should have be required to do shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       You know, in the windiest places should have windmills. And what I've read is, the only issue on any of this stuff is where are the minerals coming from to make these magnets? You know, there's things called conflict minerals. There's minerals that are, you know, taken out of the ground in the Congo by slaves. You know, there's little children working in these camps that they've documented polling, I think it's called [inaudible] Tan, that's the name of it. Out of the mountains and stuff. They used to make cell phones. It's very depressing and I don't know if they still do it there like that anymore. I don't know if since uh, it's been exposed, it's had any sort of an impact on how they do it. But um, Shane Smith was the first person that talked to us about it and I remember talking to him about it going, Whoa, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Like stop and think about like what a cell phone is like your flip that bitch overseen. I have to stare at your notifications. Everybody so scarce, not be connected, but you know, he, if you just think about the, the pinnacle of like what we use as far as like technology is like one of those things, right? And if you take that, which is like the most pervasive technology, the most advanced aspect of our society, right? The Internet in a phone that takes pictures and you can ironically connect that all the way back to a child slave that's digging rocks out of the ground with a stick. Whoa, that's dark. I used to do it as a kid. It was fun. You've mined minerals. I mean, I would just take it out of the Congo that malaria is digging in my backyard, get rocks. I collected rocks, polished him.

Speaker 1:          00:36:49       It was fine. I love doing that. Yeah. I met a dude once who pan for gold. We were coming across the country and uh, I met a dude who was a legitimate prospector and he was not making a ton of money, but he had like this idea that he could at any day like go in one of these rivers and pull out some serious gold. It happens. It does happen, especially like in Alaska. There's those TV shows where it's in Alaska where there's these guys go and they, they get a certain amount of gold out of the ground every day and sometimes they hit good pots and they can really, really collect and stack them up. But this dude was just like, and that brought him some shit that I thought it was gold and like, dude, I found some gold. He's like, no, no, no. That's pyrite.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       That's fool's gold. And I started thinking about, it was like, well, why is gold worth anything? I come, this pretty stuff was not as much as that pretty stuff. Like what the fuck is fool's gold might be worth more than gold. One some day we will like you fools. It was right there in front of your eyes the entire time. Natalie, what is fool's gold made out of? Fool's gold looks pretty dope. I think I should have some shit made out of fool's gold since I'm a fool. That's good move. We should make it happen Bro. How dope would it be to have a fool's gold watch movement? Get on that shit. Rolex with pass. Imagine a dope ass fools gold chain. Why not? It's pretty like, it's weird how like some shit is like worth a lot of money that's pretty and some shit like we don't give a fuck about rubies. The only thing that's coming up as the Matthew mcconaughey movie called fools gold, it's him and the girl on a bottle of wine on the page and there's a lot of singing. Wait, this flows go to actually exist or is this something we've always thought it was you described. That's

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       beautiful. And the watch that he's wearing, his keeps popping up

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       and they both have their crotches leaning towards each other. They do. They do look at the shadow works. They're like moving in on the deep dick and right there. Just real close

Speaker 5:          00:38:52       actually vaguely remember that he just like a pirate treasure hunter I think. Have you ever seen anybody do that or heard of people that do that? They like find a place and they can't tell anybody about it cause they know there's probably like $2 million worth of shit down there and they got to be careful because those are real kill him. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       That shit is real. Yeah. There's a whole industry of that and there's people that finance these guys. See there's the mad men that know where the fuck and mad women's are and non binary folk that know where the treasure might be. And then there's the people that need to finance that bitch and usually they make some sort of a split. Like the guy's like, hey, I'll invest and people have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and come up with Zilch and they just think around the corner, around the corner. It's got to be my pot of gold, a Roman ship that crashed. Just fill to the fucking brim. Those greedy cons, these to bring so much gold with them that it killed their boat, poison them from the inside. Imagine that he just got hundreds and hundreds of pounds of gold.

Speaker 5:          00:39:51       There's another movie, he an acts that came out last year that's sort of about it to where he goes to somewhere like Thailand and they're like, they know the spot where they're prospectors are going to like dig all the gold out of the out of the mountains and demanding thing, but it's not a in the ocean. Pretty Dope wasn't as good. You know what was good

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       that I liked a lot of people did not like the dark tower. Oh yeah, it's not good. Right? That Idris Elba Guy, he could sell me anything. I'm buying it. He's, he's like, he's a guy that's like you believe is like a legit Badass. But also can act like the, like I believed him in this movie. He was a wacky movie. It's like very wacky. It's always whacking. When you have a Stephen King book, he tried to make a movie out of it. So you have a British accent? No, not quite, but he has like some sort of a noble accent like the way talks, you know like I do not aim with my hand to aim with your hand, just to forget the face of your father. That kind of shit. You know? It was like intense, weird world that they live in, in this movie. It's very strange.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       But I enjoy the shit out of it. You know? Cause you, when you watch a movie that's a Stephen King book, you got to realize they have to abbreviate the fuck out of this. Like this is a complex story that gets woven into all these different places and you've got to condense that to an hour and a half to make it palatable for movie. It just use, it was very hard to do. Like I those, it's almost like game of thrones have made movies obsolete. It's like movies or like clunky. They're like cds, like why Karen had cds do you don't have a phone? Like who are you?

Speaker 5:          00:41:27       I I think the same way about game of thrones. I can't get into it. I'm like, God damn. I'd rather watch.

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       Fuck you. Fuck you man. I heard that. The punisher, the Guy John Byrne, dawn, I said his last name, he said that it gets a 13 episode movie. I got 13 hour movie. It's how it's supposed to be watched or sorta. That makes sense. That makes sense. That guy's a good fucking actor. That guy was great in the walking dead. He was fucking great. As the best friend wants to fuck the wife and then turns into a Zombie. She blow. Are you still watching that? No. I gave up man. I gave up. No. I read people getting mad about episodes. I'm like, no, no, no, no. What shows are you watching right now? Like what's some, what's some shows like you would never think like just like a reality show or like, I don't watch anything like that, but I do watch ozark. That's, that's the shit.

Speaker 6:          00:42:16       That's a, that Netflix show, ozarks or Ozar goes dark, just hose artist. Um, that's awesome. Which then stranger things, Ozark is a like, I don't want to give too much of it away, but it's Jason Bateman and it's this, it's, it's like a, it's like a drama, but like, uh, based on like financial shit, that's all I want to give away. I don't want to give away anything, but it's fucking crazy good. It's really good and it's fucking wild man. Like wild shit happens in this show. And you're like, what the fuck? I don't want to give away too much of it, but it's about money laundering and the guy's like a legit financier financier and he gets himself in a bad situation. It's fucking good show man. And that show got me. I watch like the last five episodes all in a row. That's a good fucking show.

Speaker 6:          00:43:07       Fast. Is that one of those that polian faster? You have to give it some time. Um, you know what man, it got me like five minutes in. I don't want to say how this episode first episode right away you go, what? Oh my God. Oh Shit. I mean, they just, they start off like a Quentin Tarantino movie. I mean, it's guns blazing. I don't want to say, I don't want to say too much. I'm gonna stop right there. I'm gonna stop right there because it's good. Um, stranger things, stranger things is fucking awesome. I love the son of a bitch. I should love that. That shows you got to go to a doctor. It's too cheesy for me. I don't know. It's supposed to be cheesy. I know, but it's like they're just copying everything I love and making and making it better and making it better. Okay. You know, Jesus.

Speaker 6:          00:43:55       I love it. It's great. What do you like? Uh, like stupid shit. Like fixer upper. What's that? It's where they buy these houses and that in Waco, Texas for like $50,000 and they spend $100,000 and they make it like this huge mansion and it's cute. I like fixer upper shows. Those are, you don't like stuff like that? No, I do. I'd like those. There's something satisfying about those. Yeah. Like Adam Carolla show was good. Satisfying. Well, you would bus people but then they'd fix it. He'd bust people that are like shitty carpenters. They were really bad contractors are doing terrible jobs on people's houses. That's a cool show too. I always, when I was a kid I always watched it, this old house with Vila and all that

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       shit. It's like, I prefer the positive shows though, man. I don't want to watch all these contractors that are like ripping people off and had a chef Gordon Ramsay. Shit you don't like separate and I love that motherfucker. I do. He gets very upset about food. But I think that this, um, the what the style of show that I like is when they take a house and then they redo it. Right. Those are the, those are my favorite ones. Yeah. This show is really cool because it's a husband and wife and she's just like a bad ass designer. Like she, she'll take it like just her paint style and, and like how she makes this stuff is very, very cool. And so the these houses and makes you depressed living at in La when you're like I can't buy a house, $50,000 anywhere in Los Angeles at all.

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       No. Right. So it's, it's amazing to see that exists. If you want to live in the pile spaces expensive cause there's not as much of it. That's the craziest thing is New York City, you know New York City, they have apartments that are $20 million and it's an apartment. You're like, wait a minute, it sounded apartment, apartment. No, it's an apartment. Even apartment. You have a great view. It's a great view but it's a fucking apartment and it cost $20 million. You're like, wait a minute. How many people are in the building with me? Thousands. No, really? Yes. You're on the top floor. There's thousands of people and you're all in a giant metal and concrete box. That'd be 20 million police. Like why in the fuck are you talking about who wants to live like that? If you ever like a pet, is it like 1.2 million a month or a pet you nail?

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       You have to pay extra because you haven't done much. I think you might have exaggerated. No. I think if you're buying it, you own it, but if you're renting it, I bet there's a lot of places that won't want to rent if you have a dog because the dog wants a fucking things up, you know, dogs will we bite things and shit on places and Piss on things. We're not supposed to dealing with that now it can happen. Yeah, but I just, it's hard to imagine that that's the right way to live. I bet it's exciting as fuck. I bet. Living in a giant apartment in New York City and deep and everywhere you go, there's just overwhelmed by giant numbers of people. It must be exciting as fuck. It's really interesting. It's like you're in the middle of the high line, but I just don't think that leaves you a lot of time for quiet and reflection.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       I mean, you can force yourself into a room and shut the door, but I think this is just a theory, but I really think we need a certain amount of actual space between each other. To relax. Absolutely. This is just my feeling. I feel like if I go over someone's house, they live in the country and I go sit out on their porch. It's like, why don't I live like us? How can we all live like this? So this is how you're supposed to live. Like this feels great. Like you go, you look, you see fucking rolling hills. You see birds and shit. Like this feels great. Like you see the trees see water dripping off of him and the sunlight's peeking through the leaves and you go, God, this feels so good. Like, why don't I see this all the time instead of fuck you. Fuck

Speaker 8:          00:47:30       you, go back to you fucking country queer. You know,

Speaker 6:          00:47:35       uh, the

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       fucking smoke and farts and cigarettes and people smell like truecar. Ah, ah. What have we done? Pissing in the streets? Garbage bags piled up, ripped at the bottom. Nobody cares. Guy Picks it up. Some of it falls out. They drive on fuck Bram Bram or just sitting, chilling. Just sit in on some soft grass. You back against the tree just sitting there. It feels better than on some stupid ass fucking park bench watching some wine. No heat zone shit. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:48:17       I did not understand how people do it. Like he loves it. He loves it. Oh, you talked to Ariba,

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       New York City. I love it. It's the best. It's the most to grover. I'm living there for toy dog. Yeah, definitely. Fuck the winter though. Who Kick? He's the best. He bails every winter. Fuck.

Speaker 8:          00:48:35       Que New York. I'll see you dummies later. He comes La. He lives here for three months. Then it goes back. It's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       It's fucking funny shit man.

Speaker 6:          00:48:47       That's the way to do it. It's a funny way to do it. I mean, I think he's going to do somewhere to time, but that went to Tom. Did Dunkin in salaries you back? Yes, he's back. He's back. We had him for a little while and we lost him. Now he's back. He's coming in. We're doing a shrimp parade. Uh, Christopher Ryan, him and me. Yeah. I knew Duncan would be back, you know. But uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       just like that winter is a different thing, man. You, you're either used to it or you're not, and if you're not, you better change. You gotta change your expectations for, for your, the way you interface with the world. Because if you're not wearing a certain amount of clothing, you're going to fucking die. Okay? Get your kids bundling mob. No, you can't wear sneakers. No, you have to wear socks. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:49:30       Fucking zero out. Zero and the streets are all covered with black guys, so we can't walk very fast and cars are going to be sliding the area. They can't stop. Bang. You get

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       drown like bowling balls. That's real shit. That's real winter stuff like you, you tried shoveling your way out of your apartment building and you're like, wait a minute. What? What? What the fuck? You can't drive anywhere. Stones stacked up on the sides. There's nowhere to put it. Like you better be ready for this. You're feet are cold. Oh, okay. Want to go back? Who's cool book? Good move. Never again. I'll tell you what, dude. I liked it. I liked it when I go into snow now too. Like one of the things I like, I don't even really like skiing that much, but I like being in the snow. So what I like, I like, I like, I like this feeling like, hey, we barely got this one under control by early. Like you can go out, but you gotta be wearing down and shit all bundled up.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       You got to have things over your little fucking bully, bullshit, fleshy digits, these little soft bitch ass hands of yours, his, those things break off. They freeze, they freeze and they turned black and snap off your feet. If you, if you keep your feet too cold, your feet, you lose your feet. They hack your toes off and shit. He gets frostbite. That's real. People lose toes cause ears. Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. Frostbites no joke man. Frostbite kills your skin. Like that's a wrap. It's over. You're like, you want gang green? No, we gotta chop this piece off. This piece is done. That happens to people. That doesn't happen out here

Speaker 3:          00:51:09       except for in a cryo chamber or whatever and that's only one girl never, and she fell asleep. That was a very unfortunate story. She was apparently working there and she did

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       to herself. She looked, she set the machine up for herself alone and uh, she was too short and the nitrogen got into her lungs. She's like breathing it in. She wasn't breathing in air and she blacked out. Horrible, horrible, horrible story. Ooh, just hearing it makes your fucking whole body clench up. Like, Ooh, what a way to die. That's so crazy. Frozen to death at a cryo chamber.

Speaker 3:          00:51:42       Have you seen this map going around? That is, there's this little county right here is Los Angeles. Oh, there's more people in this county then these other 41 states together. Not combined, but each of them, none of them are, have, are more populous than this little tiny guy. That's craziness. I think that's only with the 10 million, uh, official population counts. Yeah. We're a mad Hubba people sun. Yeah. It's so crazy. The 526 square miles, which isn't even that big. I feel like, I mean it looks big, but we keep talking. Where are we going? Where are we going?

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       Where do we go? What if we're going to bust a move. Oh, do I say Seattle still need good internet? Yeah. So now it might be the spot. You know why? Cause you get like a little bit of weather. You Go, hey bitch, listen. You better appreciate June. Okay. You better appreciate July because November is going to roll around just like it did last year and everyone's going to be depressed. Okay. Okay. I appreciate it. So if you go out in Seattle in like August people,

Speaker 3:          00:52:40       what about Oregon? Cause it's in between the, the mother hubs of Google and Amazon are bad spot right between them. I think the move is Eugene. We move in next to Dan Carlin and Cameron Hanes. Climb that mountain, climb that mountain, all Santa Barbara, my bus spot and my butt's and that's a good guy. That's a good God damn spot. It's like la light and has good wine and places to go. Yeah. Nice people. Yeah. I like Santa Barbara to chill beach to you. Go to that beach people. Super friendly. Cute Zoo. Oh damn man, that's a good spot. Santa Barbara might be the perfect spot. It's a good spot. Shit, I shouldn't have told everybody you're going to run out there and Barbara Bro. And they promise Seattle is the, you know like when you, we're from Ohio where it's gray sky every day and Seattle, I think it's going to be kind of like that. I think there's way too many gray skies. Here's the thing though,

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       are you willing to trade some grace guys for cooler people? The thing about it, and I'm not saying everybody in Seattle is cooler than everybody in La. I love people in La. I'm not saying that, but you're getting a kind of, this is just my opinion, and this might not be right, but I have a feeling that you have, you develop more character in an environment where your comfort is tested. I think if you live in a cold environment where it's cold in the winter, if you live in, where would it really rains and you get soaked and you, you hear the thunder outside. The [inaudible] is a humbling to that experience that people that live in la just don't fucking get. And it's one of the reasons why people in a lot of these other states get annoyed at some of the attitudes that people in La have.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       It's because you were not experiencing anything other than traffic. Like these people get snowed on every year. Every year they're digging themselves out. We're like, yeah, well what the fuck, man? I'm stuck in traffic, man. Like she don't have any constantly. It's one day it got too hot and you had to turn the fan on. Ooh, you're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. Just drink water and go buy ice at the store like you're going to live. Even if it sucks, you're gonna sweat a lot. Drink a lot of water. You're going to live. It's 110 stay inside. Stay in the shade. You're going to live. It's going to suck, but you're going to live. You might not live if you're living in Chicago and you can't, and your old lady and your power goes out and you're stuck in your house.

Speaker 3:          00:55:06       What's that? Traffic, but that traffic. Do you see the traffic last night of everyone coming home? It was just as bad. Look at that. That's insane. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       It's a video and it says Thanksgiving traffic, Los Angeles, four or five freeway at a complete standstill and it is fucking miles. I mean miles and miles and miles of people that look at the going five miles an hour in either direction

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       and when Satan is red because of the rear lights and the other one's white because of the headline. That's crazy. Videos. Crazy. Fuck this place. We got to go. Where do I go? I was just telling me when I'm weird. We go, here's the thing, where do we go? I'm up for Seattle or Santa Barbara. Maybe we should go to Arizona. No, I would go right next to where the walls being built. That'd be a party. I know it doesn't, it's still like we saw the sunny days in Denver. [inaudible] get cold. They're like zero or is it just, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Can I think about Denver's, it's Super Fun. Flexible.

Speaker 1:          00:56:04       Denver will go to zero. You get nine degrees for a few days and then there'll be 60 it's weird. It's weird because you're like way up high. You know, you're, you're literally at a mile high. I think Denver is 5,000 feet above sea level. 5,500 it's exactly a mile. Yeah. So that's, it's a, it's a very high city when, when you're talking about a lot of other words too. It's a very interesting place man. It's a, it's a different spot cause like Denver, either they're in this weird like combination world, right? This is the way I put Denver. Like you have a city that's like a real city. You have the comedy works. It's one of the best comedy clubs in the world. They have to, comedy works there. I think they have an Improv there too. Don't they have a Denver Improv? I don't know. I've never heard of I improv everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:56:55       Those fuckers, they're out there. They're constantly bringing, bringing the funny to the people. Yeah. They, they're everywhere. The end probes are everywhere. Right? But Denver has like everything that it has restaurants, it has like a real urban life. It's a real cities, real buildings and shit. And then on top of that, you're right next to the God damn rocket mountains. Like you look out the window, like we were just there the other day. Me and Tony did a Gig at the Belko and we were driving home. I was like, Dude, look at that. That's right there. That's the rocky mountains. It's right there. Like these fucking people are staring at the continental divide. I mean, they're just looking at the rocky mountains. You could just go, you could drive up to the top of the hills like uh, up near Nederland and shit like that and see these like quaint towns.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       It's still exists on dirt roads into the woods. You're like, Whoa, Whoa, oh, I'd probably did Denver. That would be the only place that had snow I would move to. That's the spot. I think Denver's a spot. It's just seattle. My go. My go with a good quake. Yeah. Good and quick volcano mount. Yeah. Yeah. The volcano could blow and if Mount Saint Helens volcano could blow tsunami. There was some tsunami shit about Seattle that was in the newspaper for years ago that was actually causing a drop in real estate in Seattle. Cause people were like, wait, what? Like they were talking about how someday the next hundred years a giant earthquake and tsunami is going to level Seattle. And what, you can't just say that I'm trying to sell my house, the disaster waiting to happen at the northwest. Huh. See if you can find the article. Like the article was something about con dammit.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       If I can remember, uh, earthquake, earthquake in soon. What does it look? Natural disaster danger zone. I don't think so. Experts, they've uh, on the really big one, here's what will actually happen. That might be it anyway, point being scared the fuck out of everybody because it was one of those stories that was kind of like one person reported on it and then it went around, you know, you know those like you get them on dig or something like that and you and then you go to twitter, someone will have, it will be linked to another website. You can go and check and be like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Is this really happening? Seattle go on under what the fuck? I'm like, out of nowhere. But uh, in my, we might lose Seattle. So let's, let's think, get off the list. How much are you scared of bears, right?

Speaker 1:          00:59:36       Toronto. See if you're not scared of bears, the move is Montana. Montana is the move. You know why? Cause Montana's like Denver. Well with less people, like you got an airport. If you're willing to give up a day, you've got an airport you can get out. Okay. You got to give up an extra day though for travel. Cause you've got to get out and fly somewhere and then from there you fly out. And so like the odds are you doing a show that night? You can really probably couldn't do it. You'd probably have to leave Thursday for a Friday night show. What did you get back the same day? Same weather. Yeah, but bears like the big kind of now I kind of knew people, grizzly bears for cool people. What do you do? He started fly fishing camp. Why are you laughing? Why is that the first cars fly fishing the awesome and you could do it there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       It's a great place. I mean, look, I'm in at night like after you set up and you put a gun right by your bed in case the wolves come cause they're wolves to just, whoa. Did you see the rocks in the movie that has the 34? Yes. That's perfect movie for him. I'm very excited to see it. Did you see his new Tattoo Nikko Hurtado? I made this fucking dope like bull skull. He used to have that bull on his arm and he updated it with this like insane bull skull that uh, um, Nikki Hurtado made here. It make that larger so we could see. Wow, look at that. Sweet. That is insane. Tattoo man. I mean, and the other, the old tattoos still in it. See it how the old tattoo is like the cracks now. That's so cool. Yeah. He made the old tattoo like a part of the new tattoo.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       I mean it is fucking dope and it doesn't like you have to look at it to know the old tattoo is in there cause he's turned it into these cracks in the bones of these, the bison skull. Fuck man. It's awesome. Or The bull, Scott, whatever it is. That guy's a bad motherfucker. You were seen his dad tunes. Yeah. Pull up some of his dad to is go to his instagram page. His fucking tattoo work is amazing. Amazing. He does all kinds of weird shit and a lot of photographic stuff where you don't, he'll have like a photograph of, you know Elvira's I'm shit. And it'll just like, perfect. I don't know why I said Elvira, go to Nikko. Hurtado has a page. Oh, but go to his page. As I said, I said, Nikki, it's Nico. Sorry. Sorry. Nico. Are you done with tattoos?

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       You're going? Nope. Nope. We're back. Yeah. I'm going to do a tramp stamp. I'm gonna have her on my back. The game of thrones. Lady, Queen of Dragons, mother of dragons. Oh my God. How dope is his artwork though? It's, wait, look at that. It's dude his, his artworks and saying, where's he from? What? He's a California guy. Look at the lips on that thing. Oh my gosh. It's crazy. It's just crazy. What does that woman's supposed to be? She had a demon or something. He's got a skull. Wow. It's amazing when you zoom in on it and see how, how good the details are, these incredible style. But um, yeah, I mean there's so many really good tattoo artists now. I mean, this is a weird time for the art form because it's, for whatever reason, I guess probably a lot of those tattoo shows in specific, they, they made, it seems like more people understand it more as an art form, you know, like give more like legit worldclass artists worldclass word way to put it. But legit, talented, super talented artists that decided to become tattoo artists, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:02:59       See this thing. What is it, temporary tattoo printer on your arm machine? I mean, not, not to think that, I don't know if that lasts as long as like a temporary tattoo, which isn't very long at all. But, um, at full color and probably just works off a jpeg or something. So you could try out then. How long does it last for? I don't know. I was guessing as long as the temporary tattoo, but I feel like it's a little bit longer. It's like a stamp that says, they might say, okay, better

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       what? Design your own tattoo on the APP. Oh Man. We're getting little kids

Speaker 6:          01:03:30       this indoctrination. They're trying to get these kids to accept the numbers when they come and collect the all for camps. God, what was he saying the other day about robots? It was that what it was you like said something like you tweeted him back like something like lol. What? Glitchy. Yeah. What was that? I love that guy. But sometimes you say shit that I just go, what? He needs someone like me next to you all the time. That's what Alex Jones needs. He just needs me to go, hey man, what? Stop. Stop, stop, stop. That might not be it. Some people need a rudder. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And by the way, if I'm your rudder, you've got a serious fucking problem. You got a serious fucking problem. I was hoping that flat earth or what's going to like the rock. I was waiting, I was so excited for this. He's done it before. He shot himself like 160 miles into space or some shit. Not really. No, he did. I think he did shoot himself like 1.6 miles into the air. Something ridiculous in the past and he recovered. Took him like several days to recover from the g forces. I do believe that this is something that was in the article. It might be something he said. He might just be crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:04:42       Yeah. He's trying to be like evil knievel. He was trying to do a bunch of different things and he jumped onto the flat earth thing about a year ago to gain money. So,

Speaker 6:          01:04:48       oh,

Speaker 5:          01:04:50       he's trying to like jump a limo over a boards, some dumb shit like that.

Speaker 6:          01:04:53       Well no one believes it. Come in. How do you know? Oh, do yes they do. I'm a bitch.

Speaker 5:          01:04:58       I read the article about it when it first was coming out last week.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       Yeah. You know what, I've, I've read one of the craziest fucking arguments. Someone said one of the flat earth proponents said about it, it's, this is going around apparently, so forgive me, forgive me if you've heard this, but the idea that a ship doesn't really disappear over the horizon do, you can always zoom in on it if you just have enough of a, of a powerful lens on your camera. So they think that that in some way is proof that the earth is flat. That's just proof of how far you can see. It's all it is. He likes, you don't understand like the, the curve of the earth. It takes forever. It's fucking huge. Like you're, I get what people are doing. Like who come if you zoom out, you can see, well you can't forever. That's why he can't see Mt. Kilimanjaro from your fucking living room in Santa Monica.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       Dip Shit. All right. Like it's a curve to it. It just takes a long ass time and you can't see the boat long before it goes over the curb because unless you're talking about a giant ass boat and even a giant ass boat at 30 miles away, which is what you still be able to see, some of it that's too far for your eyes. So if you zoom in with some sort of a crazy spotting scope or something like that, yeah, you'll be able to see it for a little while and then in another couple of hours it would be gone. It's going to go over the topic, but they want it to be real so bad. They want it to be real so bad that they come up with these things that aren't true as examples. Why the earth is flat and the big one was know there's how come every photo of the earth from space is a composite.

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       You didn't even bother to look into it because that's not true. If there's a fucking satellite that takes a high resolution photo of the earth, something like every 10 minutes, so the him Awori eight to Japanese style. You could go online, you could look at the pictures. It shows where every fucking storm cloud is all over the country in real time. So if there's a storm that's hitting Cuba, you go to that. You look at that image from that day where the storm's, you'll see the fucking storm, like it's all real. If you don't believe that's real. Do you believe that someone is so good at hiding shit that they've kept all the images of the flat earth from ever being published, that no one has been able to treat in the history of people, it's been able to travel, pass the ice wall and to the Nether region of hobbits and gnomes and pixies elves.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       It's just mental health. You know, we have a huge problem. Lack of education, lack of education, and then it's also being committed to these ideas to the point where they're a part of you. It's Aye. It's idea identity, politics. This is what it is. When you, when you believe in an idea so much that you don't, and I've been guilty of this and I think everybody has at one point in your life you've been guilty of not really looking at it for what it is, but instead looking at it for what you want it to be and for what you've already committed yourself to believing in. That's a big part of the problem. A big part of the problem with people is you commit yourself to believing in something and then when you commit yourself to believe me, it's something. Anything that's contrary to that belief gets fought viciously. You shut it down, you into robbed. By all means necessary. You mock it, you deride it. You don't examine it objectively. He don't look at it objectively. You just look for a way to shoot it down, look for a way to shit on it. Look for way, if in any fallback on the government lies all the time. I never believed that fall back on all these different positions, but at the end of the day,

Speaker 7:          01:08:30       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       if you look at it from just like, well, okay, what's the most likely thing? The most likely thing is it's round. They figured it out. They know it's round. You can see it from space. They've taken pictures of it. People have absolutely flying in the space station. There's videos of the fucking the thing landing on the sky. People pulling people out of the water. They they've seen, they've gone into space. Okay. They've taken pictures. This is all real. There's satellites. They're real. If you get satellite radio, it's real. Okay. It's really from a satellite. When you get direct tv, it's real. It's in space. It's orbiting the fucking earth. There's flight patterns that are carefully calculated that are going around the earth. Everybody would have to be lying. Do you understand how crazy it is? I'm with Ya on a lot of conspiracies. I'm with you on operation northwoods. I'm with you on the Gulf of Tonkin. Shit. He'd get me high enough. I'll go area 51 on you. I'll go. Bob was our, I'll go, I'll, I'll, I'll go deep on some what? Who the fuck knows? Wacky Shit. Take it to the earth being flat and that's when I go, you're just chasing your tail. You're chasing your fucking tail.

Speaker 1:          01:09:45       Angry little pricks. Call me a shill. They're just showing you around her and she'll share it on what a perfect, perfect advertising is. Advertising. Show jamie.com [inaudible] dot com give yourself a round earth shill tee-shirt votes and I have one done by Christmas and they're very soft cotton. It feels wonderful on this camp. Yeah, I think it's almost like a troll man. I'm telling you. I used to think that too. It started out as a troll. This is what I think happened. I think it became an exercise in psychology from what I've understood. One of understood, and I might be wrong, but from what little I've done poking around about this, it seems like it's might've started on four Chan and it might've started as a joke that there's always been a certain percentage of people that believed that the world was flat. There's always a certain percentage, just like there's a certain percentage of moonies.

Speaker 1:          01:10:36       There's a certain percentage of people that you know are Satan, watch Brazil. People just, there's wacky beliefs and people get attached to these wacky beliefs and they fucking clean tim, Matt, and to say in whatever it is, whatever, whatever the belief is, there's a certain percentage of people that have always thought the earth was flat, but then what I read was it someone on four chance started trolling and that by trolling and trying to post this fake evidence about the world being flat, a bunch of people bought it and they ran with it and not only do they run with it, they started to ramp it up and add things to it and flat earth theory became a thing and these people all decided that this was like a legitimate pursuit. That there is some Illuminati, some group of Jews. It's always Jews that are hiding all the information that somehow or another they've talked. All the map makers, all the people that work in commercial shipping, all the people that are flying airplanes, all the people that are making satellites. Anyone in aerospace, all these fucking people, all these people, all these people are all together and they're all lying. Okay. And I am. I am too. Or maybe just listen to this. Maybe you're chasing you're fucking tail and you confuse the shit out of some people that are dumber than you because of your inability to look at what it is versus what you want it to be.

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       You heard me? I'm not writing about everything. Don't get me wrong. You're fucking, I'm right about this. There's no fucking reason why someone would lie about the shape of the planet. There's no benefit in it. There's no reason why anybody would conceal that information. There's no benefit. If someone found out the earth was flat, they would be fucking singing it from the rooftops. And he real scientist and he real person has been in the space station and he real person flying a space shuttle. They're real. I know you're a girl. You don't know him. I've met him. I had that, uh, Chris Conrad Guy. Is that his name? Chris Hadfield. Chris Hatfield. I forgot his fucking name. Commander Chris. I blamed the weed. Chris Hadfield. He was wonderful. He was in space for a long time. It's talking about the effects of it when he came down and how it, how bad it fucked up his body.

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       That was a fascinating podcast. I remember had, I think I got like 40 minutes with them. Then he had to go. It's like one of those quick little things and he was amazing. You're talking to a guy, it's been circling the fucking planet in a metal box. No, let's do it real. It's real. No, it is real. This is the reason why your phone works. Understand this. The people, this is what's ironic. The people that are doubting the highest minds and the most competent technological innovators in the world, like the most competent people are the people that are involved in like aerospace,

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       airplane construction, jet pack, construction, cell phones, computers. Those are the people that are at the top of the fucking heap and these apes that are using these devices to say that the world is flat. You're doing just what a massive disservice you're doing to the very minds that have created the thing that you're using to complain with this ridiculous idea that someone's hiding the information from all the people because they don't want you to know that the world is like your phone. Man, I get it. I want to believe big foot's real. I get it. I want to believe if you show me some fucking half ass big foot footage, I'll watch it three, four times in a row. I'll go one day. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Hey, you never know. There's a lot of parts of the world we never go to, and also more deep in the Congo.

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       I wouldn't be surprised, right? I want to believe, but I'm also objective. You gotta be both. I know you want to believe the earth is flat. I'm super sorry, but it appears to be round as fuck. Just like every other planet we've ever looked at. All of them. Imagine how crazy would be if earth was flat. Well, here's the problem with this idea. You fucking dummies. A lot of the people behind this idea believed that it was created by God, like on a pizza tray. Like this is part of a religious belief is that God made this flat earth and the cosmos and it's all about us. This is part of it. This is, this is a connected to your group, Julie. You're so arrogant with your idea. No, I'm fucking dumb. Okay. But I'm smart enough to know the world is round crazy assholes.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       Have you talked about net new Trenton neutered trouty

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       net new neutered and trout trout. Yeah. You know, I saw mark Cuban saying positive things about nick net neutrality and I was really surprised, but then I realized he's a rich old white guy. And if I was a rich old white guy, be like, listen, we don't need regulation. We took care of Arizona, we clean up our own neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          01:15:20       He also has a lot of money. So no matter how much it costs, he doesn't give a shit. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:15:24       there's that for sure. But then, um, he was making some arguments and I'm too fucking stupid to know what their nineties right. You know, I've, I've heard the arguments against it and I think those make the most sense. But apparently there's some big business people and a lot of, I get your hippies, Yolo drove. Of course there are those fucking aerosols. They never have enough money. You're right, you're right. But also like you got to let them, you've got to let them do their thing. You know, you've got to let them do their thing. It's like I, I don't know who's right and I would love to hear a really educated objective analysis on whether or not that enhances competition or hurts it, whether or not that's good for business or bad for it. Most of the stuff that I read says it's bad for it, but I need to look at it really closely.

Speaker 2:          01:16:13       It's definitely letting them censor the internet and that's like, like what is the exact restrictions? Do you know? Um, it's, it's up to the ISP to be too, like, hey, you want this website? We might give it to you. They said they can start editing stuff. Say as an example via Viacom who is owned by Time Warner or whatever. Cause they like something comes out against the CEO of time warmer. They can actually go in and edit the Internet where it's nice. See Right now it's free. You can do whatever the fuck you want it. No one's editing it really, you know, unless it's like peto websites or something like that. Right. But uh, so it's going to be like in the future, like we're China. If they don't want you to go to my space, China will be like

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       soft dude. I was reading about a Vietnamese blogger today who was sentenced for seven years in jail, a 22 year old Vietnamese blogger. Um, it was in the New York Times. Um, he was writing about an oil spill and they said that he was, uh, talking negative and you doing propaganda against the state. They locked them in jail for seven years for doing journalism on an oil spill and for pointing the blame at the government or whoever the fuck was responsible for the oil spill. She's 10 years. Did lockman dl for 10 years because somebody wrote an article now a different one. That's the girl. That's a girl. That's another one. She's from earlier in the year I went, I went deep. Dude, there, they're locking bloggers up over there. Vietnam apparently they have great good issues with like gay rights and you know, a lot of progressive ideas that we subscribe to in this country, but they do not tolerate criticism like it's apparently in that way very totalitarian and that if you do criticize them in the form of like propaganda, like blogs against them, they'll lock you in a fucking cage for like a decade.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       It's scary. We've got to really appreciate, this is one of the reasons why, I mean, I don't know if trump understands this. I guess he does, but he doesn't give a fuck. I think his idea is like, you're going against me fucking, I'm going against you. Fuck you. CNN. You know I get it. But by just like completely deriding them like that, like you, you run this risk of getting to a position where there's not like this objective powerful force that's watching over the president and reporting on all of his actions. Right. This a chart that I read today though that was a little disturbing and it was like a truth chart and it was like how many times CNN has said things that were not true? How many times does it have to correct itself? How many times did they say things that are true? And uh, I don't know if it's right. I don't know if that, that might have been some horse shit that I read, but if it was right, I was like, whoa. Are They Brung that often?

Speaker 6:          01:19:02       Any News, especially when it has breaking news guys, it's at least they're correcting themselves. Where like our president won't correct himself in. True. That's good point.

Speaker 1:          01:19:11       Maybe, maybe that's what they mean by being incorrect and that like, you know, the latest report says, but it, see that's just what the latest reports as the latest report might not be. Correct. But if you say the, that's the latest report, you're not wrong.

Speaker 6:          01:19:27       You just don't have the right information. Right. And I think everyone knows that when you're watching the news, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       Right. Like if something happens like some crazy shooter type situation. Right, right. It's just very dangerous when you see the president and the free press going after each other like that. So he tweeted today what

Speaker 6:          01:19:47       he said, we should have a contest as to which of the networks plus CNN and not including Fox is the most dishonest, corrupt, and or distorted and its political coverage of your, your favorite president in parentheses. Me, they're all bad winter to receive the fake news trophy in all caps. It's her fucking president. Wow. That's so weird.

Speaker 1:          01:20:09       This is so weird because here's what's weird. It's not weird to think this, but to broadcast that, to write that down and to put that on, that's like that. It's crazy. That's a crazy thought. I think I would like him so much better if he'd never tweeted like, like if we just had news and that's it. Yeah, but you're getting to see like we were talking about this, the stress of this thing. I mean this is how he's always been fires back at people when they fired him. That's his thing. I mean, should have known, but people's for some reason expected them to be different. Once he got in there, they expected, well, he's just doing it for now. Just trust me. It's going to get in there. It's going to be super cool. All right. Have you tried to Bait Bait him yet? Oh, I don't want to get to bait him.

Speaker 1:          01:20:52       No, no, no, no desire. I don't want to ever do that to anybody. I just looked. This is the world that I'm seeing. You know? I'm just, I'm reporting on what I'm seeing. I'm a reporter. I'm like a journalist. That's what I'm seeing. I'm seeing a bunch of like whether they're justified or not, there's, there's a bunch of this pettiness, this all that should be avoided by advanced human beings. That's what's the problem is the lack of humor to it all and the, the angry pettiness of it all is what's most disturbing. Not the idea that something wrong with this system because if that chart was right and a wrong a lot and if they're wrong about him, that's there's one thing, but the, the way that that should be handled as always pointing out exactly and specifically how they were wrong, how it could have gotten back to them.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       That was the wrong information and what they've done to correct it. If they have it, acknowledge it and then that's it. Like that's, that's what should be done when you're in that position, when you're just a regular dude and you want to just go on twitter and talk some crazy shit and you know, say the sooner is fucking fake news. It feels like some firefighters somewhere. I don't think she'd be fired. If you say that, like I don't care that you can say that. Right. It doesn't bother me when you're the president, you got to go, come on man. You definitely are. You're setting an example like is as weird as that seems to say to someone that like this is a part of the job. You have to set a good example. You can't, you're setting the tone of the country. That's the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       Like I wouldn't write that. Would you write that? You write that to somebody's never fake news. Trophy exclamation points. So come on. I hate it. That's crazy. And whoever let you do that needs to get you some mushrooms and have you seen as boomerangs, like a boomerang and his snapchat. Oh, we have snapchat. I'm just kidding. Imagine though, if Tega you had, that would be hilarious if he did. Uh, you know, people get tired of all this anti trump stuff and you know, people get tired of just hearing the subject. It's almost like just, it hurts them. But those, those kinds of things, that's like fuel for the fire. It's almost like he's doing, he's doing the work of the people hate him for him. He just keeps providing more and more ridiculous shit. Do you think

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       trump is, he get mad at him for, do you think trump's a flat earth earthers no. No. I mean some of that probably a look, man. I would like to know what he thinks about Kennedy, but he keeps releasing these documents and I'm happy. Um, and some of these documents are crazy. You know, they've um, there's a lot of like, one of the ones was about Jack Ruby, Jack Ruby saying the day that Kennedy was going to get shot a get ready, going to see some fireworks today. Like what? Like what did he really say? Like how do I know he really said that I want to know. I really, I really owe it. But if the FBI got it from a credible source and that they really believed that the problem is like the people that Jack Ruby was hanging around with some crazy stripper is doing like some 1960s version of speed.

Speaker 6:          01:23:53       Yeah. He told me, he told me fireworks was going to happen. Yeah. And then she runs off into the fucking forest it where the fuck knows. Maybe check Ruby just had like a nice party surprise party later could have going to set off president got shot. What would be the best evidence that you would need right now to like know that that was true? That's a good question, right, because I've seen people argue that the photo of Lee Harvey Oswald is convenient photo of him in the backyard with a rifle in one hand, a newspaper and the other hand that is photo shopped, not photoshop, but photo edited is, I don't know if it is, I don't know if it is. I don't know if it's been proven that it is, but I know that that's a common statement and then if people have broken, they've done some analysis on the photograph and I do not know enough about photography to know whether or not they're right.

Speaker 6:          01:24:41       The shadows are all off. I think that they found out that they, the magazine did it too for some reason, like at the magazine did it not like the government or anything. Maybe I remember it being a controversial photo, but then I remember someone saying recently that they believe it was not faked and that there was new evidence to indicate that it was not fixed. It's just the problem with being like a surface reader. Yes. The one in the far left. Yeah. That's a Dallas police reenactment. Yeah. How do you know that? They're the exact same time? You don't have a camera when he was come on stupid. You can't take a photograph as a reenactment unless you know exactly when he took the photograph and you have the same clouds in the sky and shit cause they're, I guess they're trying to like find out whether or not that was a real photo or whether it was Lee Harvey Oswald's head put on somebody else's body, but the body matched his body go to focusing on his face. Don't go to this one. There's one, there's one that's like a better resolution version. Right? You go to the one right above it actually without him right there. Yeah. Yeah. That's the photo. It looks a little off like the head definitely looks a little weird head. I guess the shadows is what they're talking about. The shadow that's coming from the bottom of his Chin's not the same as what the shadow is, blah, blah, blah. On this feet. Oh no

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       ma'am. I'm not smart enough to know whether or not that's true, but it looks okay to me, but it's so grainy. Let's look at that photo. Imagine if that was, but pictures are today. I can, you had to check out a girl's tinder account. You'd be like, hmm, what do you really look like this? I've seen there's the full wine now. Now Look, look at his feet like zoom out of Louis is his feet shadows. See what we see it. There we go. See how the shadow is going that way on his feet and then if you look at his face, the shad is like kinda going to make that picture of the smallest. We can get the whole picture in there.

Speaker 7:          01:26:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26:36       something like that. I don't think that's correct. The thing that would make me feel like something was weird

Speaker 1:          01:26:45       is just that it's so old that you couldn't really tell whether or not someone doctored it and they might have had reason to doctorate. That's it. That's what makes me think that it might be fucked with not the actual picture itself. When I'm looking at the picture itself, I'm trying to find reasons why it was fucked with, you know, but then again, I'm losing, I know Jack Shit, I recreation. Oh, you guys just tell you right now, there isn't, that guy tells boring stories. Oh, that was legendary. Half beyond. That was jock Louie. He was depressed and he made fun of him. Your stupid fucking buck up. Sorry. Sorry in advance. I'm just joking. I'm sure that guy has great stories, but that those days, man, you'd get away with a lot of shit. You know, there's an interesting article that, uh, David, what's his name, David from, from the, he's a a conservative writer, New York Times bestselling author. He wrote something about it. Shit. I'm trying to remember what it was. Oh, it was Richard Nixon's letter to, uh, JFK, his widow. It's like heartfelt articulate, interesting letter between an opponent of John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. I mean that, that's who he was. The opponent of John F. Kennedy wasn't just Richard Nixon, like they were running against each other. And so he writes this like really heartfelt letter and it's like, Whoa, you read it and you'll out. Wow. Which it, Nixon wasn't as stupid as people want. Think he was. He was very smart of course, but just was fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:28:23       I think this job just does it to everybody. I don't think anybody gets gets out of this one alive. I mean, look at Donald Trump's hair. It's already getting kind of white like, yeah, but it's all painted and who knows what the real car that stuff is. That's true. It's probably all white. He's probably just given up. Fuck it. Not going in today like Switzer. Today's die day. No, now it says cheetos and the couch day. Fuck you golf. I'm going to watch Fox News and they gonna tell me on awesome. He just sits there stroking it, watching Fox News. Fox News loves him. It's interesting to see white one one network just going full gung Ho we're going to go trump all the way. And I supposedly, that's why he's getting involved

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       with that merger of Time Warner or whatever to get rid of CNN or something. So, so god, that's crazy if that really happens. Yeah, that's the idea, right? Like Time Magazine's being bought out a t and t is trying to buy time Warner, the whole company or something. Dude, these gigantic companies. See the thing is, I don't know shit about this, um, net neutrality thing. I don't, I need to know more about it because I need to know if in some way, here's the real scary thing that everyone who owns a giant company would be able to control their own internet. Like you would have like a network, like you would be on, you'd be on the verizon Internet thing and he'd be on comcast like, oh, you're on comcast. Ah, you can't go to my website, Shit. Yeah, that's what we don't want them. There's, there's a, there's an article I tweeted the other day where on the, I think la times or something like that word, somebody, a woman who works for the FCC a row.

Speaker 6:          01:29:58       Like, like, please don't let us do this. You know, like, oh, I read that. And there's, there's a website you can go to where it's automated, where you can put in your information and we'll write an email or a letter to the FCC. So I recommend doing that. I mean there's, there's, I think we have like 10 days til they vote on this. That's what's crazy. Is this, this should be something cause this is a very important issue. This should be something that's debated on prime time television. Absolutely. It needs to, it really should be. I mean all of these kind of really crucial, crucial, this is where you stop listening to me, her shoulder memory, all of these crucial issues, they should all be discussed in the, like the public forum. They should be discussed in like the, the center of the town. That's what the show should be like.

Speaker 6:          01:30:41       What CNN and any of these shows should be. Part of what they should be is like a town center where people talk about these like super important ideas. This is an important idea that needs to be like they need to interrupt television shows for this because we might be signing off on a terrible idea and we might be letting companies get away with having more and more control over us. I don't know. I need to go look at it. I need to really look at it carefully, but we all need to look at it carefully. If this is really happening in 10 days, the average person's not going to have the time nor the ambition to go and investigate this. Yeah, scary. Think Jamie. As I was looking, there's it. There's another thing that happened too that they're voting on I think this week. Monsters, the PR.

Speaker 6:          01:31:21       Another problem I have it is too, there's five people on that panel of the FCC board that decides these decisions. It's usually one person that's the flipping vote that makes it a three two vote. It's never like five of which one showed up and the solid gold Bentley, which one got out his next covered in lipstick. This guy, he's the analysis, but the FCC wants to relax when a broadcast media as big as rules that has to do with like a small, like a small city having one company owned the TV station and a newspaper in that area, which is like a media rights issue. Oh. So they want that to come back there. They're trying to, yeah, stop the rule

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       that prevented that or like re Redo the vote on it or whatever. But um,

Speaker 6:          01:32:04       I get that rule. I get that rule. But the problem is like if you're, you want to open, I mean it's also, I get the idea that you should be able to open as many companies as you want. There should be some sort of fair competition.

Speaker 6:          01:32:15       But the problem with like fair competition in the news, it's like in the news, you don't always want to get the most ratings. Like you want to like report like an APP, like, uh, an honest account of all the issues that are actually happening. But you can't do that if you want to sell ads. You gotta he gotta be spicy. You've got to go to that fucking fire quick, get to that fire. Let's see. Let's see the car accident. Chase's please chase the shit. We interrupt this basketball game to show you a guy that's never gotten away from the cops. Said that's what you see, the Oregon one. You know what I'm talking about there. There's one in Oregon than recently. And it was the craziest thing ever. He was like going through a fields, Oklahoma to him, Oregon told them ost data stuff. I'm not going to,

Speaker 5:          01:33:01       wow. There's a show called out. I was gonna bring it up a second ago called shot in the dark. It just came on Netflix. It's sort of like the TV show version of the night crawl or movie. So it's following some news crews around Los Angeles every night while they're going to find these like crazy news stories. Wow. And they actually, the first episode that catch a parked car on the 10 and uh, they're like thinking a, it's gonna be an accident can be real bad. And literally like five seconds later, boom. Fireball guys to go save the guy pulled him out of the burning car. Whoa. It was really intense. But that's what's happening all the time too. And the news that they're catching and sell. I saw it last night when I was watching the news popped up is another thing, a hostage situation. But some guy got paid probably 500 bucks. We're going to find video of this. It's real weird.

Speaker 6:          01:33:46       Do you ever see that night? What? What does that movie nightcrawler. Nightcrawler's yeah, that was a great movie man. How dare you? That's good guys. All right away my movies and my past Coco. Have you seen coco yet? There's Coco. Coco is the, um, the new pixar movie with a, it's all about the Mexican holiday day of the dead, you know, and, and all. But I did see one other Mexican day of the dead movie. It was crazy where they went to this other dimension. That's Coco, but I saw this, this the second one. No, this is the first one. You might've saw it early though. No, I saw it on like it on Itunes, on Apple TV. Oh, there was another one that's interesting. There was another crazy ass movie with day of the dead characters that I watched recently. A book of life. That's it. The book of life, Dude. It's fucking amazing. You haven't seen this? No. Is that just like a trailer? Animation is fucking insane. It's so why wait, this is it. So there's these like wooden people and then they, they get somehow or another taken into this other dimension and then this other dimension, it's like tron drugs. Man did this looks like the same characters. If no seat. This is like, why is no one about this yet?

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       I have no idea. This is sort of like when they did those two, what'd you go switching? What does this now here's the new one. Yeah, but go back to that one cause it didn't quite get totally freaky yet. They start getting really freaky towards the end. Wow. It's Guillermo del Toro. I, yeah. See this is where they, they're entering into this other dimension and everything is like super bizarro. Like the people are weird. It's really strange, like everyone's dead. It's so bizarre.

Speaker 3:          01:35:27       And that's exactly what coke has a bad, but it's like you remember that? And when deep impact and Armageddon came out the same time, it's like it like somehow or another somebody figured out like, Hey, these day that dead things are dope. Look, there's two other ones. That volcano movie and then like Tommy Lee Jones was in one and then Pierce Brosnan was in one, but there were like two movies about volcanoes and it came out like the same week. Yeah. They always do that in la. And one was not once next earthquake when we, he's like, look at this new dimension that he enters into. Sam, same shit. This is the same shit. It's exactly that. That's, I can't believe no one's talked about this weird man. This is

Speaker 1:          01:36:02       more dead people. And the other one was more like bizarro weird bond. This is pretty bizarro dead people. I mean, look at this. Yeah. It's like they find that like a bugs bunny and you know, whoa. We're going to have her own bunny are bunny's name is Tim Gaffey and Donald. Yeah. Daffy duck and Donald Duck like, hey, which one was mark? Which one is warner brothers? Which one of those Taffy Taffy guy more than a donald. Donald's the Oji though. And uh, they were the only ones that had the balls to have a hunter that like a bunch of moon, elmer fudd and then a bunch of other mean hunters and some of their movies like the Bambi movies, a mean hunter. It's a bunch of other ones. But the uh, elmer fudd that was like the first dumb white God you could mock in a cartoon, wasn't he?

Speaker 3:          01:36:55       No, I think they had a lot of dumb white people. You can mock.

Speaker 1:          01:36:58       Is he the first and when we're filing the rabbit gets away all the time. The rabbit lake treats him like a bitch. Like you fucking dummy. You're never going to get me. Like he's never threatened bugs. Bunny's never threatened by Elmer Fudd. He's a rabbit and somehow or another elmer fudd is so fucking stupid in elmer. Fudd wants to shoot this talk and rabbit. He such an asshole at it. It's wabbit season and he's got a giant head like a baby. Like what does that,

Speaker 3:          01:37:25       why does he have a baby head wait, homer fund. It's an enormous baby head. I never even noticed that. He's like a baby with a gun. What's the other one? That was elmer and then there was another one that looked exactly like elmer, but it wasn't elmer. Elmer and that's right. There was another one and another guy. There was another dude who was the other guy. I always thought that was strange. Like, yeah, there's more than one hunter. Right there was was the other guy. It was like the second Mister Roper when they changed the Darren on bewitched. Yeah, they changed the husband.

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       The husband got crazy and he asked for money and they're like, mm, Nah, bitch. Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:38:00       no, no, no. We got a new dad. He's like, well, I'm the cold star of the show. No, no, no. It's I dream of Jeannie motherfucker. Nobody cares it. Darren is trashed house Sam. They pulled the fucking court. The floor dropped out. He disappeared.

Speaker 6:          01:38:15       I don't think there was another hunter. Yeah, there was a, it was another dude. There's another dude, didn't have another buddy with them. Might be like one particular cartoon that maybe his brother showed up for something and they went hunting together. Fool's gold in the fake Elmer Bernstein bears. I actually, I saw that a long time ago, but that wouldn't freak people out. It's just like, it should have been a different name. You Dummies Zam movie. Where was it? Or Exist? Can exist. What are those called when people like collective. Yeah. What is that? Emory, you forget what it's called. Fake collective memories. Those are super common electronic coupling. Yeah. Those are super common about the Mandela effect. That's it. That's right. Yeah. That's simulation

Speaker 1:          01:39:02       shit. Yeah. Um, so we were talking about this elsa gate thing. Yes. This is, this is weird. No, this is not a conspiracy theory, ladies and gentlemen. So before you go, oh, I can't believe in show. Here's the morgue. So true. It's hard to Solon, listen, there's something going on where they're making these youtube clips and they play like, you know, how have you watch, if you watch a youtube clip, say on the brand new 2019 corvette Zr one like I'm, I'm a car freak. I love watching those videos. Like wow, look how fast, look at it. Go what a beast. And if you just let that play ill, youtube will suggest a nother corvette movie or video and play that and maybe a video on a shootout between a couple of different types of cars he would handles better. And then you'll just keep playing like car videos cause it thinks you're on that loop.

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       Well somewhere along the line, if you're on a kid's loop, you can get looped into one of these elsa gate videos. Now some of them, like the one brian showing me, he's like really shitty CGI second life. And it's like these cartoon characters get together and they become like sexualized and they drink sometimes and the babies keep getting their heads busted open. Like the babies fall and the beer bottle flies through the air and hits the baby in the head and cuts the baby's head open and blood's all over the place and that one happens all the time. It repeats itself over and over and over again. That same scene in a bunch of different weird cartoons with like babies and baby animals and you know there's anthropomorphization videos where it's like, you know the, the, the wolf has a bunch of pigs with them and shit and the pigs get drunk. Like that kind of shit. But there's like hundreds and hundreds of them and youtube is me. They had to be alerted of this stuff. You know, people were watching them with their kid and it would go on auto play and your one year is all sudden watching a beer bottle fly through the hair and head in a [inaudible] rather and bash a baby on the head and causing big Gash. Have you seen any of those?

Speaker 2:          01:41:02       Yeah, I just, cause I used to watch the ones that you, you know, the second life ones where it's just ridiculous. Like this stuff is crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:41:08       It's weird. I didn't even know about this. They dress up in these cartoons. They have little babies that are dressed up like spiderman or like Elsa and like this. This scene keeps happening over and over again where they have beer, they get fucked up and then as the baby falls, the beer bottle bounces off his head and shatters and lands on the ground and the baby's bleeding. It happens over and over again and so in this one with the minions, a little baby minions, they fall, Bam gets caught in the head. It's the same scene. Here's the Mickey Mouse. One little babies get fucked up. They fall. Beer bottle hits the baby in the head is another one with a little foxes. They get fucked up. Beer bottle hits the kid in the head. It's always the same shit. It's stupid. It's not stupid. It's weird. It's weird because it's not. It's not just things happen and it's, it's the same violent scene over and over again and the babies are the ones that are getting brutalized in these. They're getting hit in the head with beer bottles, giant Gash. His blood. Like what is that?

Speaker 2:          01:42:06       Yeah, it's almost like that. What's that? Yeah, the youtube crap or that you used to be really popular where they would just edit things together real fast and an end with like ha, like screaming. And what was that shit called?

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       That was user created. There was a bunch of people like you could see those people doing them. They just decided to try to talk real fast and cut out all the breaths in between it and slam it together. Look, you have no intention span whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       Now this stuff like in what we're watching now I find, I feel like they're all, they're all using the same characters. Right? So it seems like to me it's from a message board. It's like when we were back in the day on your message board and we would like make all these videos and stuff like that. It seems like it's from a group of people that all are doing it. You know, collectively like to me it seems like, like you'll find like a deep four chan thread in it or something where like, Oh I did the baby falling video or something.

Speaker 1:          01:42:56       No, there's a bunch of different ones man. I mean there's, there's this was like with real people but the ones that you're talking about with the, uh, the cartoon ones, they're being made in other countries. They're not speaking English in any of them. It's all like noises and stuff and they're generating like if their ad friendly and some of them were approved for ads, they're generating a tremendous amount of money. You got to think about how many hits these fucking things are getting and how many like see if you could pull up one and see how many millions of hits it had. Got It. Yeah. I just pulled up, had 5 million, 5 million. Okay, so 5 million hits is the business. All right? If you've got ads on a video for little kids, that gets 5 million hits, that's a business. Now, if you've got those things in there, generating them by computers.

Speaker 1:          01:43:38       So you're making hundreds and hundreds of them and you put them all over the Internet and they all have 5 million hits each. You're talking about a substantial amount of money that you're getting every month and they're just making these things. And then the real fucked up thing. It's like apparently there's some, again, I just read the beginning of this and then never read any further into it but read it. Ah, how to thread apparently where these people were trying to decipher some of the things that are being said in the comments and they think that they're using the comments as like ways we're child trafficking. People can communicate with Jonah. This is like speculation, which sounds like wow, that seems far fetched. But so it doesn't child trafficking sound far fetched. I mean, you know it's real. All right. Child trafficking sounds crazy farfetched. Like the idea that someone's so evil that they're selling children, right? It doesn't, it doesn't it? Yeah. So if that is, then why wouldn't it be that they would communicate? I mean, is it more far fetched that they communicate in code in some sort of way in the comments?

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       Yeah, because they probably wouldn't do it on kid videos. Would probably do it online. Like just like any video, like tractor.

Speaker 1:          01:44:44       It could be videos or something. I think. Yeah, it could be. Maybe they're not that smart. That's where the trauma Lester's right. But, but also that, um, like these why else? These kids are not going to make comments. So who's making comments on these videos?

Speaker 2:          01:44:58       It to me, again, it seems like it's a, it's a group of people somewhere and it's making these now the fact that that youtube is letting them sell it as kids, they need to change. Youtube needs to change how they have kid videos. Cat Videos should have a team of people. You get approved then you become in for sure two kids. That's it. You can't just upload anything and put the kid to tag on it. You should have the kid tag. Yeah. How kids find out about it. Yeah. You give your kid the user response when you get your kid like the ipad and he put it on Youtube. Kids that should be selected videos only. It's been approved by eyeballs and so on. I should not be able to make a kid video, you know? That's true.

Speaker 1:          01:45:38       Definitely not be able to make kid video where a kid gets hit in the head with a fucking

Speaker 2:          01:45:41       bottle right now. If that shit was like just on like once someone, one of us did it and were like, I just made all these stupid videos of kids falling down on the ground and it wasn't for kids. And then you'd be like, that's just a stupid cartoon that you would see on like adult swim or something like that. Four in the morning, right in there. You could see something like that on adult swim at four o'clock in the morning, especially the ones that I watched, those stupid ones

Speaker 1:          01:46:04       that could actually be like some sort of a, an like some thing that, what's that called? What's interspliced inside of a show where like a non sequitur video comes in. And what's that called?

Speaker 2:          01:46:15       Uh, it's like an adult swim cartoon where you're like, what the commercial work commercial out of nowhere that's just

Speaker 1:          01:46:22       get stuck in there where the Mickey Mouse Daddy is drinking with the babies. The babies fall and gets hit in the head with a bottle. Like what the fuck? And then you cut to some wolf that's telling you about the past of robot chicken a lot just to real quick 15 second thing and be like, what? What's that? What does the word interstition what does that word? I don't know. There's, I know you're talking about it's blank interstitial, cause that is, uh, that was, matthew mcconaughey was in that too, but he was in this movie. He was the

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       dark tower movie. Oh really? It was. Yeah, he was, he's the bad guy. Matthew mcconaughey's bad guy. And all I could think of that was all I could think of was, um, Louis C K is bit about Mad Mike and, uh, Louis C. Case bit about Matthew mcconaughey. Do you remember it? And he's like, the law says you can't touch, but I see a lot of law

Speaker 8:          01:47:11       burgers out here has lilly does

Speaker 6:          01:47:15       brigette he talks about how he, he was, he loved the movie so much. They was walking around his house saying that thing over and over and over again. So when I was watching this movie, Matthew mcconaughey is the bad guy. All I could think of is Louis C K is bit going on things. A lot of law burgers out here. Match of a guy. It's a stripper.

Speaker 8:          01:47:36       That's all I could think of. That fucking happens, man. That happens. Where a good comic. We'll do a bit about something like that. Oh, that subjects ruined. He's got me every time I see Matthew mcconaughey, I think it was a thing is a lot of long burgers.

Speaker 6:          01:47:55       Hbo Pulled All the Louis C K Shit offline tid. They really? Yeah. Okay. That's a hard one. That seems silly and it's still funny comedy. He wasn't jerking off in front of anybody when he did the comedy. Like just like you can't invalidate everything everybody's ever done. If they did something bad, it's not good that he did it, but it's kind of fucked up that day. Did that even though he, you know, the situation of him asking permission and him admitting it and coming out and apologizing, but yet didn't, there's that, that masterson scientologists guide that all his shows are on there and then there's like real, the more people. Do you think that those are real, those stories are real? I think a lot of them are real. Yeah, I really do. I mean like why haven't they done something? If that story is real, it seems like that one would be something that would get a lot of attention

Speaker 8:          01:48:43       hold. It happened

Speaker 5:          01:48:46       yesterday and, uh, the, I guess sports world and the Ohio state world to the, so the defensive coordinator who used to be an nfl coach was rumored earlier yesterday afternoon or I think maybe even Saturday, that he was going to be hired as the new head coach for Tennessee's football team. Um, they were going to make the announcement yesterday evening I believe, but at some point after the agreement had been signed, um, it hit the media in Tennessee and there was protests in front of the stadium. All of their fans and alumni were pissed at this is going to happen. Someone out of that, he was on the Penn state team, he was one of the assistants to Jerry Sandusky. Ooh. So the uh, tying to that, although he's already been vetted by Ohio state, like he's already the coach there and Urban Meyer's team has vetted them and backed him and all that.

Speaker 5:          01:49:34       So before the night was over, they already canceled a contract and now he's, I think even going to sue them for money that he was supposedly going to be owed, cause he probably, he could have already got rid of his house like in that day because he was going to leave, you know, so all sorts of things happened and just, it was like literally 24 hours or less that close to, he worked at Jerry Sandusky, I don't know, cause he was an assistant. He was younger. There's other, there's a couple of other coaches on there that claim to not know anything too. I believe man and sort of some other people like Kirk Carpentry. I started tweeting out last night that this was a, um, like, do you really think that you should do this with no evidence? There is no evidence in this case apparently, and he's lost. He doesn't have that job opportunity now I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:50:15       I think you need a real investigation before you commit to something like that. And He, I mean, I don't know the case. He might have not known. It's possible that he didn't know. But if you didn't know, like don't you think there'd be like a story you'd hear something melt down over potential hiring of Greg Ciano is a bad look for Tennessee program. Hmm? What's a bad look? Hmm. I don't know what it see. I don't know what the fuck is going on. If you knew that this guy knew, then you would have this feeling like, hey, fuck that guy. But if you, if you knew that he didn't know, you'd be furious. He'd be like, no, you're, you're labeling an innocent man and saying he's a bad person. Like there's needs to be an investigation. If there has been an investigation, you've got to accept the results. Otherwise you're on a witch hunt. You got to figure out what's really happened. I don't know. See, I don't know the particulars, but if you know the particulars, you know, and you, you're, you got to make a case for it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:13       It's like, look at Al Franklin. I like it like that. That let a little vague picture of him like acting like he's grabbing that girl's boobs and then you see the, all the stuff that comes out about her after where it's like, oh, she, she was like groping all these people the whole time. You know, Leanne tweeting. No. Yeah. If there was a been fake

Speaker 1:          01:51:31       dude, I didn't see any of that. There's video of apologized for what he did though. Like, I mean, what he was doing was trying to be funny, trying to be funny, taking a picture and he wasn't even a, he was a comedian bank then. He wasn't even a state representative. But either way, it's like you don't do that. That could be your mom, that could be your sister. She's out cold. It's not like it's your girlfriend. You joke around. It's one thing that was your girlfriend. If you girlfriends out and you take a picture like, and you'd be silly, right? She loves you. That's your girlfriend. She knows the joke. It's like I've heard she takes a picture like sit next to your Dick while you were unconscious. She goes like this one, I wouldn't be upset. Right, right. Um, but she wasn't his girlfriend. She was working, he was working, they're always doing this charity tour. And she said that he tried to kiss her. There was like, it was more than one thing. So he apologized for that. And then there was the other women that were saying that he grabbed her butt.

Speaker 2:          01:52:24       Well it's that dance do that. He said that was just like, you know when you're taking photos. And he said, the one girl said like, he put his hand on my bike. I mean, when you're taking a photo, you just put your arm around somebody. Maybe a touches your, but I be, I be old

Speaker 1:          01:52:36       dudes like to grab butts too though. It's an old dude thing. George Bush. George Bush, George W. Bush likes to take pictures of people and a ride as they go to take the picture. He squeezes their ass,

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       but that might be like some old Texas man. Thanks. Hey joke. Plus he's almost dead. Leave him alone. Like people have to realize he's the longest living president ever

Speaker 1:          01:52:56       at this point. Yeah, he's the oldest one. Yeah. Jimmy Carter Carter still

Speaker 6:          01:53:02       now he's not his old Herbert Walker. Bush is older than Carter. I think you right now he's the oldest surviving president is what they say. But Carter is the longest, longest to go that he was president. Yeah, man. He's almost dead like he's got to grab acids. He's going for it. That's what's also ridiculous looking. If you, if you became like like a president or something like that and then you went through all the photos you've ever taken with fans after a show or at shows and stuff like that. You can take any of those photos. My, Oh my God, look, he's making a blowjob face to a woman under the age of 17 or so. If you freeze every people take so many pictures.

Speaker 1:          01:53:41       We're taking pictures when you're not looking at your mouth is open. Yeah, but it's like, I think that those old dudes just grabbed acids. I think that's what's coming out.

Speaker 6:          01:53:53       They just thought it was a thing. They get away with it. They grabbed acids when they took pictures. They probably grab yours do just to get to look in your face like, oh, totally. There's probably a joke. Sports. I don't think anyone really slaps butts anymore. It used to be a thing all the time or they certainly, they slapped butts. There was a video that Morgan Murphy posted and it looks like a, I think it's on her instagram and it looks like some dude comes from behind or refereeing smacks his buddy in the ass and the guy like goes, yeah, see if you can find it. It's on Morgan Murphys. Instagram from I think yesterday. I think soccer player is constantly do crazy shit, like grabbing each other's dicks and shit. Oh Damn. It happens in football, but that's like in a scrum than not like a friendly, right. Right, right. But this is two referees. This video is a referee doing it to another referee.

Speaker 1:          01:54:38       It's hot. This is here, it wants this. So this guy, he's my off times man. They talked to each other and watched. The guy comes by and Oh, the flag in the face. Oh, he took a fine his butt pinched. I know. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:54:55       That's another thing. Barely pay attention. Parents. That's me hoping that it was a buck and that's why I freaked out. That's how I look at things. I'm like, just show me any reason why this is more exciting than it really is.

Speaker 1:          01:55:09       Wow. Or just seeing a guy get hit in the face of the flag. My brain was like, not good enough. Not good enough. I've been drunk for five days. Oh yeah. I did vacation and uh, just got hammered every night. It was wonderful. Wine. Drunk wine. Yeah. Wine bonk wine just puts you out, man. Like, I don't know how the fuck the barbarians invaded countries on wine. Just seems like they would have no ambition. Like wine just makes you so tired. We're lucky they didn't know about like whiskey, Magid. The barbarians had whiskey instead of wine. Been way bloodier

Speaker 3:          01:55:46       I can't, I haven't done one in awhile. It gives you a puts out bad morning I think I, yeah, there's something

Speaker 1:          01:55:53       then going on right where you get like a weird headache sometimes. I've talked to people about that. I never got a satisfactory explanation that I wind up. Are Men remembering. Yeah, I bet that's it. I bet it's like eating a lot of cake. You eat a lot of cake, Ben. You get that fucking feeling the next day. Like what did I do? I didn't watch anything at eight all week eight, whatever the fuck I wanted to eat. That's my go to vacation move now. Yeah. Yeah. Cause then you come back, you feel so bad that you want to like get back on a diet. It'd be like real cautious and that's why I'm going to do this. No wheat, nope. No Pasta, no sugar workout. Five days a week. Two drinks a week. That's it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:35       I've been trying to eat steak a lot. Just just steak, like steak kabobs. Those aren't my thing. Dude watches wheat documentary, you'll throw a pizza away forever. No more sandwiches. Pizza, no more burgers. I can't wait for the meet doctor to come on soon. Right? Yeah. Yeah, the meat down there. Better way to describe it. But yeah, the carnivore, he's a full carnivore.

Speaker 1:          01:56:54       That's all he does is eat meat. He thinks he's been like this crazy proponent of meat eating only

Speaker 3:          01:57:00       the has to be badgered. Stanker you're something, right? Cholesterol or a site owner. It seems like it would be

Speaker 1:          01:57:07       perfectly healthy though. I just, I dunno. I mean, I think one thing is like, I would think you would need some nutrients from vegetables, right? And then there's some things you can only get from vegetables. But then are you getting any of that from me? Because they eat vegetables. Like that's the idea. It's like lions don't really eat a lot of salads. They just fuck up zebras and zebras. They do plenty of salad eat and for the lion and the lines are good. You know, they don't really have to, uh, eat it on their own.

Speaker 3:          01:57:36       If that blueberry affects the bear meat so much that it changes the shape and color and taste of it, then it not all that shape. I didn't mean that but like that definitely, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:57:46       Changes the color and the taste of the meat. It would only make sense that you're getting something from the grass when you eat a steak, which is why grass fed steak is better for you, like proven for you. Then corn fed steak because corn is basically sugar. I mean well it's not good when you shit and you see, hey that's not even digest

Speaker 3:          01:58:05       it like the reason why he's he corn in your shit cause that your body's like, what am I doing with this? This guy's eating plastic. Just spit this out. That's such a weird thing. You're assholes. Just like get it out, get it out. When I'm going to try to process it. We're not going to break it down. Did I tell you a long time ago, I think I already told you this, but back in the day when like hands across America and all that shit we were supposed to write in school, like how do we help starvation and stuff like that. If we have any ideas. And I wrote about how we should just feed everyone in corn and then they could wash it off the next day and eat it like a few more times. And I got in trouble for that. Like mom had like, brain's always been

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       gross. My Mom's like had to get caught in and it's stuff like that because of that. And I was thinking like, well you can eat it twice. Like that's like make sense to me. Like it's untouched. Did you know that some native Americans used to call it a second harvest and needs to eat thrown shit. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I read that somewhere. I think the cooked it or something. They call it second harvest. I mean, you gotta be hungry as fuck. Oh, by the way, the person told me, this might've been crazy, might've made this up. I, I'll remember who it was. I'm trying to remember. Oh, okay. It was one of the wardrobe ladies on Newsradio. She told me that. I was like, what did she seem pretty cool? So I just listened to her and back then you couldn't really look anything up. Now I haven't looked. Is it true? Confirmed by urban dictionary. But I thought, well then texting urban dictionary is Hashtag woke what top definition Hashtag woke anyone could add to Irv urban dictionary. That doesn't mean it's real. Native wa a method developed by native Americans to conserve as much food as possible during deadly winters. The act involved sitting through, sifting through Ugh, feces for chunks of corn and nuts. Sleeping Wolf, my little bear. Your poo is rich with the second harvest. Oh, that's not real.

Speaker 1:          01:59:59       Yeah, you can get very porn. By the way, I'm connected now to a group of all outright furries. I am, um, I'm investigating. I'm a journalist. I told you earlier today, and I'm investigating outright furries cause a white, white people who go crazy who are, um, very reactionary and quick to jump the gun and call everybody a racist. Wrote this article about, um, I don't know if it was a white person wrote it. I just assume probably wasn't about, um, these Nazi furries like Neo Nazi furries. Well, the absurd obscure a subculture of furries has a problem with neonazis.

Speaker 1:          02:00:47       Any groups of sexual abuses. Here's a lot of Nazis. I mean, cut the fucking shit. Please. Just please cut the shit. Please, please. I can't, I can't keep going. I can't, I can't keep going. It's just too crazy. Every day it's more and more fucking weird. This stuff I can get. I think this is as the same people that watch this youtube videos or make the youtube videos. I think the people who make the youtube videos, dude, I think it's just like they're lit. They're in Asia or somewhere like that and they have a script and they just keep throwing the script over and over and we're looking for like hidden messages in the script. I think the script is probably just fucked up. They think it's fucked up to have a cartoon character hit himself in the head with a bottle. And I think you're probably right. Like maybe these fucking child predators, maybe they communicate on all sorts of different websites. Maybe they just decide like, hey, let's meet on this tire forum and we'll just say things in code and attire means this.

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       I mean it wasn't that always the shit with pizza gate. Like they thought that they were talking in code. Like all the conspiracy theorists thought that a slice of pizza meant like a kid and the youtube one, I mean them being there being so many of them sort of says that there's money in it. They've tapped into an algorithm and they're just beating it to death. Yeah, and they just have the same script and they just do it with a computer change. One little thing, little thing here and there and that's what I think it is. I think it's not as nefarious as everybody likes to think, but it's really fucking weird to keep seeing the same video playing out over and over again with a bottle flies through the hair and the baby gets hit in the fucking head. You'd floods. I think the activity was a little weird.

Speaker 6:          02:02:15       Or when it's people actually people doing it. You can't just have a computer make it to where people are. God damn nuts. They're nuts and they're out there. I like furries. Uh, I th I get that. I have a bunch of outfits that I make videos with and stuff and that's pretty much what that is. That's just basically cross play. Any kind of a roleplay. Yeah, they're having fun, having fun. They don't feel like normies. Right. I'll say it right. Yeah. And I'm sure having sex like that, it's probably fine. And that's Kinky. Like, hey, you're dressed up as my pretty pony and I'm spiderman. Yeah. Probably a lot of that. A lot of dude on dude crime. Other words, these hats, they're wearing fucking weird animal hats and their bone in each other. Paints. Why not man? But you know why? Because this is crazy.

Speaker 6:          02:03:05       So why not? Why to do it? Why not do it? See, look at that. Just like a Fox and you're fucking each other in the Fox is fucking the chicken. Why not? Why? Really? Why not? I just, I don't know. Why not? I can't tell you why not. Why is it okay that people were crazy fake eyelashes and extensions in their hair and they pumped fat into their ass and put silicone bags and their tits? Why is that okay, but it's not okay to dress like a big chicken and get fucked by a big rooster.

Speaker 6:          02:03:35       Why isn't it? Why can't you pretend to be like a fox in the hen house, right? Why not? Like if as long as everybody agrees, like do you agree to be the Fox? Okay, cool. Them dog. I'm going to be the bulldog mascot, the big bulldog head and we're going to bone. They're going to make some, some rendezvous was, why the fuck not? Why not? Yeah, I'm down for that. They just do whatever they want. I mean, I dressed my grow up as a school girl. You know she's Asian. There you go. Why not dress her up like a anime school girl? Give her a big fake head. Where would it be? A boner with a big fake head on big anime eyes can actually kind of crazy fake ponytail. I got her, I got her some tentacles. The other day. Wow. Technical Butler. That's the weird thing. So tentacle Porn, how did that ever take off member? That was the thing when we first found out about tentacle porn, I remember like collectively the Internet was like, what? Wait a minute. How much of this stuff is existing? How much? How much is out there? What the fuck is going on in Japan? Tentacle Porn was a loophole for or report insertion because she can't show a insertion. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:43       See like energy finds a way. You have the, it finds the weakest link and it makes its way through. You can't suppress it. That's why I like what you see with Catholic priests. That's why you see in this. You can't show penetration, Huh? Huh? Huh. Okay. How about crackings with a, a dick on the end of every octopus arm and they're banging eight different school girls. How about that? Good. Cool. Here's the, here's the magazine. Thanks.

Speaker 6:          02:05:14       They're all school girls. Japan is so weird, man. Big veiny Dick. So it'll like ripping their lower jaw out, but it's just coming out of an octopus so it's okay. Have you seen their game show called like slippery stairs the other day? I wonder what the, like the cheating would be a, how would you cheated? Slippery stairs seemingly someone in America would figure out a way to buck the system. Right? I would say it would have something to do with pulling the other guys down. Yeah. I don't think you can touch them though. I don't think so. Can you? Yeah, I think you can. If you did, I think people would just get ahead and you would never let anybody get close to you, but I think the problem is for people listening, it's, Oh my God, he was there. Oh my God. He was there. He took everybody out like a bowling ball. This is amazing. It's amazing. And then the other guy went down to the guy who was ahead of them. He got cocky and he fell all the way back. Yeah. This is a great show. That looks fun. It looks like they should call it like tooth, the chipper or something like that. Who would be a good host to this? You know it's somebody else who'd be a good host. Tony Hinchcliffe be good host. Maybe not.

Speaker 6:          02:06:29       I would love it. Dude. Japanese game show cause they, that's just one. Jesus Christ popular. Perfect for it. Yeah. Koreans and Japanese people don't get along. So it'd be even better. Yeah, it's girl. There'd be people mad at him. Did you know that Koreans and Japanese people have a sorted history? Absolutely. Um, oh Jesus Christ. Your speed skating down at like a slope. Oh my God. This is insane. There's the two other sports and this was one of them and that slippery stair thing came out. I was like, this new, this is new. Very, very, this as to fall [inaudible] 13 a red bull. This is insane. Oh my God. Oh my God. These guys are gone. Saw. This is incredible. People are hanging over the edge. I hope people don't smack them. What's this called? Ice Logos. Lizzy. Crack crashed ice I think is what it's called, but it's like, oh, this is insane.

Speaker 6:          02:07:18       It's like a downhill hockey speed. Cross x type. I don't know. It's real weird event. Just a matter of time before somebody figures something like this out, right? Like eventually people just make things crazy and crazy. You're like, this is way better than like a lot of shows. Like just look at this right now. Just the just intensity of this race, and now compare this to golf, right? If you watch golf on TV, this is riveting. Like this is way more riveting than people racing cars, isn't it? People stop playing football. They're going to want to do something crazy. Yeah. This must be it. Roller Derby Downhill, pretty much. But this is an agility thing. You know, like Wayne Gretzky was not a big guy, but he had incredible agility on the ice. Like you would have to be like one of those Badass hockey players. Like bieber is bieber hockey pile.

Speaker 6:          02:08:05       Yeah. Justin Bieber. Yeah. Imagine if he became like the top dog in this stuff. It just, people are so mad at him. He's a little punk. He can't be good at this too. Piece of shit. He's also a boxer. Thunder. That's a boxing and ass. Nice somebody. He's talked to him about the amount of tattoos. I'll be the guy, hey, stop. Stop. Which to do your stomach covered yourself up with tattoos. Settle, Bro, you're young. I get it going crazy. Got All the money in the world. You're balling, banging bitches left and right. I get it son. Just slow down your tattoos on your chest. Don't make sense. Is that unless there, does he have a Lesnar? What does that and that's across anyone. One of those things in the bottom is that a ship? What does a lion? A bear. What? Eagle. That's an eagle, right?

Speaker 6:          02:08:52       Here's the need. What are those things above it guy? There's so much chaos going on there. What's up? But the nipple lines, one of the things, if you talked to tattoo artists, like they want to make sure that like design stand out, you know like the rocks Tattoo, right? And Nikko Hurtado Rose Tattoo the rock. It's arm. See how that stood out? Like it popped, right? That's because Nico is a master. Not that this guy isn't covering that up. I think whatever it is, he had some written, oh, oh he had something written. Well, hey bro, get that shit lasered. That's, that's a lot of laser, you know, be a man. This lie. They like this. Ah, pretend that lasers making it more powerful.

Speaker 6:          02:09:36       So you gotta think you gotta think with eat with us paying I grow with each one. I'd be calm. Stronger. Yeah. You don't write over writing when you can erase it. Everybody knows that. Why would you ever know you don't do that? Don't do that. Burn it off. At least there's a way around what you're doing. Okay. That's a way around it. There's people that get those. Uh, what does this branding, branding that's gusting open. St prue has that. He's a top UFC light heavyweight. He's got that, uh, like one of the fraternity things that his arm, he's a football player. Tennessee. Yeah. He does that thing too. When he wins sometimes it makes the, what is it you, it's there. I forget what it was. It's crazy. A lot of basketball players used to do it. I think Michael Jordan's also in that frat fraternity shit. They banned all fraternities at Ohio state the other day. Too much rate. Yeah. It happened. Yeah. The kids get to rape at all. Shut down there. That's crazy. All the hazing or something was going on probably that they should never have fraternities anyways. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:10:40       you are guaranteeing some crazy shit's gonna go down. It's like you're just going to, you're going to have to have some sort of an agreement. Like how much crazy shit are you gonna allow? Because if you're going to let a bunch of dudes who are just starting to have boners all live together in a house, they have a house like they let girls in. Can they let girls? Then they're gonna open the door. Girls can come in, can they drank? They can. Okay, what the fuck are you doing? I can get a bunch of people that are dude's shacked up with other dude smelling each other's butts, getting crazy together. I'll fucking drank and I watching movies of every bachelor party, every fucking fraternity movie ever. We get a group of guys together. Every fucking, what is the, the hangover. The hangovers. Another example, every time you get a bunch of guys together, fucking chaos, chaos.

Speaker 1:          02:11:26       Every single movie, you get 10 guys together, they go somewhere. Wow. Is that a control? People getting punched? Somebody get shot always. Right. So imagine you're letting these 18 year olds who don't even know how to control their bodies yet. You're, you're barely an adult. You can't even believe. You can think for yourself. You can decide when to wake up. Your parents aren't there with you anymore. Finally, your dad is not fucking pissed at you because you forgot to mow the lawn and like, fuck you dad. I'm not here to mow your lawn, Bro. Okay, the next thing you know, you're, I know that other, and a bunch of dudes are just like you and you're all drunk and girls come over and they're drunk too. You're like, Holy Shit, this is the best

Speaker 6:          02:12:04       laurie about life. Make some mistakes. You weren't no frat parties work crazy though. I mean, they were, they would have like hookers there. That's where all the drugs, when you first saw like drugs and you're like, what the hell? There's drugs here the most, the closest to a frat. I live with two dudes once and uh, there were good guys sorta. One of them was a little fucked up, but it was a, how about a bunch of men together like that? It's just super sketchy. It's unnecessary. It's super sketchy. You can go, you can go bad. But bunch of young guys, I remember hearing stories of, it wasn't even a Frat, but it was like the ski club house at Ohio State would have 30 kegs at their parties on Saturday. Yeah. It's like there's 15 people living in a house. What the fuck is that? Don't do that. That's not good. That's not good. Plus Alpha plus liquor plus plus all the other things. Yeah man. When you get a bunch of people living together

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       and especially when you're young, you make shitty decisions and then the three of you are making shitty decisions are the four, the five or the 10 all like the same age. I'll just as dumb all fucking trying to out agro each other. All out of hammered. Come on, you know. And then on the other side you've got some crazy bitch who finally got away from her dad and cheese. Fucking Jack and nobody tell me she and everybody figures out life together.

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       Yeah, we should keep sororities. Definitely they have sorority still at Ohio state, right? Because they're like, oh Scott. I think it was both of them. Oh really? I only heard, I only heard fraternities. I think sororities like good cause it's about dorm rooms. I mean dorm rooms. And what about that? Dorms are crazy toward him, sir. Everybody knows dorms are crazy. They're just not. The thing about dorms is you don't have to join. Right. Dorms are like more egalitarian cause like you get to have a bunch of people did like different things, different interests, different. They're just different men and women, different parts of the world. Everybody lumped together in this dorm. They all just can't really afford an apartment. And they're all living together in this university setting. But they could be anybody. Your net and you roommate could be anybody got to share a bathroom with everyone in the hall.

Speaker 6:          02:14:20       That one shit in the news recently where that woman was, uh, they didn't get along and had a dorm and so the woman was like putting her toothbrush in her ass. She started getting sick and they found out that she was doing all this shit. Oh my God. How'd they find out? Hidden Camera, uh, toilet camp? No, I don't. She probably sued because she got something in her ass white woman arrested for torturing black students. She called Jamaican Jamaican Barbie. Whoa. And I guess she admitted to it on facebook or something like that. Oh yeah. She's like, how's the people rallied at Ucla and set fire to a trump and Yada unrelenting story. It's unrelated. It's showing up on here, but at the video, this is all just about various pieces of racism that people are finding. Huh. Wow, that's crazy, man. That's fucked up. Magine stick in someone's tooth, brushing your asshole and then watching them brush teeth with it.

Speaker 6:          02:15:14       Clam dip in or lotions rubbing. Use tampons on her backpack for a month. Oh my God. That's what she did. She, she did crazy shit to this poor girl, which probably want to hear buzzing. Yeah, she probably wanted to it just probably like fighting off the gay. Yeah. Look at this and then she tweeted about it. Oh my God. She treated it. Come on, I can finally say goodbye. Did you make and Barbie. Oh my God. Make that a little bigger. Finally I did it. Yo girl got rid of her roommate after one and a half month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip and her lotions rubbing, use tampons in her backpack, putting her toothbrush and places where the sun doesn't shine and so much more. I can finally say goodbye. Jamaican Barbie. She said she was making that up as part of her defense, but whether or not she wasn't not, I don't know. Story came out a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. See the thing is like, you might think it'd be funny to say something like that and make it up and it might be made up. That's true. You might think it's funny to make, but boy did you fuck up by saying that like you gotta make something like that up and then put it on the Internet where anybody can find out about it. That seems crazy.

Speaker 6:          02:16:24       I guess you can test her toothbrush and stuff like that for every day. Like you have the time.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       Do you have to know when the last time you tested your toothbrush for, but juice every well has it. Yeah. That's one of those things people just don't test for. Test your toothbrush to see if it's been someone's ass hole. It's just a lot of things I'm thinking about. It's not one of them. Yeah, and I just, how bad they hit each other, but that called them on a stick. A tooth brush. My brows bitch eat my shit. Well that's a sick type of person. I'll sit there and watch. You brushed their teeth, their asshole juices. Good in there for a weekend in the gums and the gums allegedly. Yeah. Hmm. I wonder if she did it. She did do it. That's a sick bitch. Ooh. Magine as in the thought that has to go through your head to do something like that. Maybe she didn't realize how gross other people would find it. That's the crazy thing that she told everybody. Like people would probably been doing that to each other forever. I think the first thing she did or was it a slow build up?

Speaker 1:          02:17:29       This is a spin brush right to the lower ribs frauds, frauds at the lower ribs and she's, she's got the toothbrush like this with their fingers. What she's like barely got the bottom of the toothbrush. She's knuckle deep in her own ass hall and she barely has the bottom of the toothbrush and she's got a kind of user shit muscles to force it out when she could pinch down on and pull it out and sometimes she has to do it over and over. And again man, I wonder what you imagine you get a drink prune juice to try to get that toothbrush out of your household and you got to keep, you don't want it to hit the wall coming out and then bounce back up. So you've got to really open it wide so like you probably got to have to wear like long gloves, you know like Lube your ass all up and they just were like some of the gloves you wear when you like clean and bundles of sticks and shit. Those, you know those ones made out of swings this way. Good grip on things that are slippery.

Speaker 1:          02:18:30       He's pulling your butter part, trying to get that toothbrush out and right when it gets out, you hear the keys in the door. I got the pictures back and put it in the glass clink and you shut the door and just wash your toothbrush off real quick. But you've got to dry it too because otherwise should pick her toothbrush. I would go, why the fuck is my toothbrush already wet Donna? And like if you put toothpaste on a wet toothbrush, you know that's a fucking wet toothbrush. He looking down and I think it looks different. Why is it when you feel that your finger, you know, whoa, it's cold and wet. What the fuck? Who is just using my toothbrush? You think about it? I've been at work for nine hours. How the fuck is my toothbrush? Not Dry. It would be dry or something like that in her asshole. All you smell it. It smells like Madison, Madison and Jim Poultney. It's smells like roundup and went out into the fucking garage. Got Some lawn spray.

Speaker 6:          02:19:28       Do you see that new thing that's a, you put in your mouth and it brushes your teeth for you? Lazy? Yeah. In 30 seconds it's brushed your teeth. Is it better? I don't know. It's an interesting idea that we'd like, you know, you could just put it in your mouth in the car or something like that in 30 seconds later. I don't know how proven it is and it seems like it would get down now. It's just weird. I wonder how much of an impact fluoride in the water has on preventing tooth decay, if any. I've been reading about Florida and the water and it's so hard to figure out who's nuts this ten second automatic toothbrush could save you hours every year. She's hot. I hope she brushed her teeth. Wow. I put that in your pussy. Imagine of her. No. Imagine for breath, smell that she's out pretty would suck lik that.

Speaker 6:          02:20:17       And she goes, this is like a ball gag. This is like if you were going to like practice strengthening your neck, you'd bite down on that thing and attach that rope to like a bungee cord. Like the iron neck device you that thing that you chew down and it strengthens your next book. Makes Sense? Yeah. This guy go back to that guy like, come on Bro. I don't care how much they're paying you for this, but he's the same one and his girlfriend comes by and kisses him on the cheek and leaves like he doesn't need to have time to get a good kiss on the lips because you too busy sucking on this robot Dick.

Speaker 6:          02:20:50       This thing is just cleaning out your face. How about you brush your teeth like a fucking normal person? Maybe have the newspaper open beside you. I just wonder if it's better. I mean that dedication. Here's my question. Is it better to go to the car wash or wash your car by hand? Mm hmm. Of course it's better to wash a car by hand. That's why hand washing costs more money. Well, it depends what car washing, what's better, what's better, what's better to give you your teeth, the attention they deserve and go over each one with a fine brush or suck the robot Dick. And he cleans your teeth out. It should be just to save time or not. I don't know. It's a good question. Yeah. But how much time should you save and how much time should you like? I've been reading a lot about meditation.

Speaker 6:          02:21:30       It's something I'm also considering I'm getting get into during discipline. December. It's cool because the tank is not going to be here for another couple of weeks. So I gotta wait. So, uh, I'm looking for other ways to expand the mine. So I'm thinking to do a little 10 minute meditation session every day. Every fucking day. That's the thing. Every day you got to do it every day it got to commit yourself. That's a long ass time. Seems like it's not, but it is. You're like, God, I have 10 minutes. I gotta go to work. Nope. You gotta do it. Gotta do it sometime during the day. A couple of those apps, I think they help you like start streaks and stuff so you can kind of game in a little bit of help me get to your fucking phone. That's what they helped you look at. Watch when nine o'clock rolls around, get out of bed, meditate, get 10 minutes to hear about this new dating app.

Speaker 6:          02:22:17       Caught Hater and a, what you do is you put what you hate and it matches you with people that hate is named the same thing. Oh, perfect. So it's like it, it's interesting though. It's interesting though because it's backwards, you know? So it's like, what if you only get matched? Like what if I only got matched with black women for some reason? You know, so all the thing, it's so unnecessary. Yeah. It's, I think people are probably getting laid more now than ever before. And I read this article where they were putting the blame on stds, the jumping stds on tinder and grindr. Like, no, no, no, no, no. You can't. No. Okay. Are you going to sue? All the nightclubs were giving people herpes. No, you're not. You can't do that. You, these are the places where people meet. They're not responsible for whether or not someone's got herpes or Vd.

Speaker 6:          02:23:03       Stop it. We'll make it too many people. They're just trying to, it's a money grab. They realize that a lot of money in tinder and someone's gonna start some class action lawsuit and all these people that got the herps or a real strong stuff like it's like a real car. You're legionnaires' disease broke out at Disneyland. Oh yeah. What? And nine people got it. What in the fuck legionnaire's disease or is it, what the fuck is that stuff doing around like we gotta have some old, you know, because of like preservatives and food or some shit. Have some old diseases. Make it come back. What is legion like? What is this symptom question? I don't know. Because there's another old sounds terrible though. Yeah, it better be strong. I better be able to fuck you up. I'll get super pissed if they name like some bitch ass.

Speaker 6:          02:23:47       Common Cold Legionnaires' disease, a slight diarrhea. It just makes you fart. All Great. And it doesn't spread from person to person, but through mist. Yeah, it's from the lottery. Oh Man. So it's from their water sprayers from an air conditioner. Yeah. Oh my God. Is that what it was from? No, it's from, it could be from that. I thought it was from outdoor mystery. Wow, that's crazy. Yeah. So it's somehow or another got on outdoor mres and then got into how many people? Nine. I think nine. How many of those people were weak pitches? Yeah, the kids. I mean that's just a joke folks. I'm sure they weren't. They were wonderful people. Uh, elevated levels of Legion area bacteria. Wow. Causes Disneyland. The shutdown cooling towers. Notice shutdown cooling towers not shut down, bitch. I'm sorry. The show must go on. 15 people have when 15 people.

Speaker 6:          02:24:41       Holy Shit. Now what is, how dangerous is this stuff? Find that out. We removed our roof, viewed our water quality testing data, including testing performed by our third party water quality maintenance contractor and learn that to cooling towers had elevated levels of legionella bacteria, Legionella, Legionella, legionella bacteria. Fucking amen. That's like some 28 days later. Shit. Right. That's where it breaks out. Like when is it going to, when are we going to get a disease? It turns people into crazy people. Some we already have it right. 28 days later type shit though. I think you just get sick from it. It sounds like maybe diarrhea or getting the chills. Fever. It can get diluted with the antibiotics sensitive people. Hmm. Well, that was this week document or saying that everybody's more gluten sensitive than you realize. Right? It's like, it's like being allergic to a cat. Everyone's allergic to cats, but some people have. Yeah, everyone's allergic to it. But about dogs. Is everyone allergic to dog dander? I think. I think so. I think, but yeah, definitely. Your levels of it. Severe often lethal form of lum oh, of pneumonia. Oh my God. It's a severe, often lethal form of pneumonia is caused by the bacterium. Legionella pneumonia fell into both potable and non potable water. Holy Shit. That's not good.

Speaker 6:          02:26:07       Can you get it when it one happens on water? Because fuck, I hope those people survive, but those people are going to be okay. Did the people from Disneyland get treated and released. Oh, okay. I need information. This is a, this is the dumb Bro News Network checking in. Hey Bro, Delta, Delta [inaudible] Bro. Right. I heard a, the fucking zombies are a Disneyland Bro. Just keep it on lockdown. Doesn't want you to know bro. They all over 50 to 52 sick. 50 2:00 PM now the age they were over the age of 52 kids. One was 94. Oh Jesus. What are you doing at Disney? Well, maybe their immune system is more compromised when that old, yeah, the body can't fight it off. Can't fight off the funk. Fuck man. 52 that's like Dean del Ray's age. Isn't it weird that that's uh, all of us are eventually, if you keep going, you're going to be a hundred. Like if you live like one day you'll be, if you survive, you'll be, who knows? With medicine science, you can easily survive.

Speaker 7:          02:27:06       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:27:07       Wouldn't put all my money and you make it a hundred be 77. But if you did, I mean, did you, you never know though. Dude, I'm telling you. We're so close to like innovation, breakthroughs, medical breakthroughs. What's this? What do you got? 55 cases were found in Orange County last year and they don't know why. God, Orange County's recorded more than 55 cases of the disease is here and the seen the number of cases jump in recent years, similar upward trend has been seen naturally and elsewhere in southern California according to the healthcare agency though. What's causing that is unclear. Don Don Don to coop the two towers ever shut down where a in the backstage area more than a hundred feet from the nearest people. Huh? Oh, that's why only a few people got it, Huh? Yeah. Wow. Maybe that week we can be in system, but maybe just some, Tommy didn't clean the thing.

Speaker 6:          02:27:53       He was supposed to clean because he was lazy cause he wanted to put on as furry outfit and go, Fuck Huh. Go on a furry fuck fest. Maybe that's what happened. How many furries working distantly lands? Probably all of them, right? Yeah. If you are a furry, that'd be a dream job match. You could walk around pretending to be goofy. Go to goofy's kitchen and wave at the kids is on top of her showing up. What's that thing for? Security is on top of furry showing up on on the parking lot and want to get them Outta here. You'd have to use a um, incognito social media

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       account, which all the firies do anyway that I've come across over the last three days of research. All Furry group especially, they have to be super careful, especially the art fairs. That'd be super careful. Well, what's the difference between off like all right there all right people to trump supporters that are fairies, fairies and maybe fairies to brownies. Brownies are, yeah, they're right up there. I like bronies now I can get down some brown brown. I don't know if that's real. By the way, if you're, if you're an ot furry and you're mad at me, now that's not, I don't know if it's real. I don't know. But one guy was calling himself for Nazi. Yeah, that sounds like a troll to me when maybe, but isn't that what a lot of this stuff is being silly? What we're supposed to pretend that that's not like the spirit of the Internet sometimes.

Speaker 1:          02:29:08       That's what got me so mad about that whole pepe, the frog stuff. It's like, listen, this spirit of the Internet is in fucking with people. It has been forever. People are bored. They're at work. They come up with hilarious memes and some of them are really fucked up. Does that mean that guy's a real Nazi or does it mean he's just an asshole who's bored at work and he's mad at everybody? It might be that, you know, I don't know how many of them are like real Nazis and how might have been. We're just people fucking around. That's like the Internet, right? The Internet is all right. Like so much of the Internet is people fucking around. It's so hard to tell what's going on in any given moment. You know, like this flat earth thing. I, that's the great thing about it, but doesn't change. It can't change. Do you think it'll change? Do you think that really it'll get to a point where they'll have so much control over the Internet that there'll be able to stop content like that. Like there'll be a closed down like message boards or a social media where people are allowed to talk about stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:30:05       They do it in every other country. All must, you know, they just, the main reason they want it is because too many, I mean net netflix takes up like 75% of the bandwidth right now. Does it really? Yeah. It's like something crazy where all these videos and we're all, we're, it's going to get worse. Four K Eight K, 12 gay. So they want to have control of, you know, if you're gonna use video or if you want, they want to like pretty much it's, that's what I think they're saying there.

Speaker 1:          02:30:31       Well, I kind of get it from their perspective. If say they have a limited amount of bandwidth and then the one application, like Netflix is using up most of their bandwidth of paying the same amount of money. Right. I don't know if that's the case though. That's the question I'm not sure about is is there a limited amount of bandwidth? It seems like there's always been an infinite amount of bandwidth, right? Why would there ever be true socialist Commie? Just wondering you bad for business. I get the pipe. The pipes might get clogged, which could be a thing. It's all happening at once. You would really freak me the fuck out. When I found out there's a real pipe, it goes across the bottom of the ocean. I went, wait, what? So if you send an email from somebody from Australia, there's a God damn pipe as someone laid across the flat ocean of the flat earth all the way to the other side, if that, those people have to be in on the flat earth conspiracy as well. By the way, why does it just go by satellite? Why does it have to go through this pipe anyways? I don't know. It might not be a pipe to Australia, but it's definitely a pipe to Japan. I believe. Trans Atlantic Communications, cable and transatlantic communications cable, transatlantic communications cables, a submarine, Whoa. Submarine Communications cable connecting one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other. After mid century, coaxial cable came into use with amplifiers late in the century, used for optical fiber, uh, and most now use optical amplifiers. So that's only one cable. It's only one

Speaker 5:          02:31:52       probably really big. And their mouths, they can't be just one. But this just made me think of something else I wanted to show you that I just found the other day that's kind of scary. That has to do with fiber optics

Speaker 1:          02:32:00       done. Done. I gotta get to it, but it's time for another episode of Jamie Vernon scares the world.

Speaker 5:          02:32:07       Me a link that showed that uh, people can hide a microphone. I don't know how big and how well it can listen inside of an ethernet cable. Oh Geez. And they were like, check all your cables cause you never know what could happen. And then so I started looking through the tweets of that and it showed there was a link to a, a company that made a fiber cable. And the description of what the fiber cable could do is that it could listen the entire length of the cable.

Speaker 1:          02:32:34       And

Speaker 5:          02:32:35       it was sort of saying it was just to be able to listen for like a water underground, like water pipes that are leaking and things like that. But it doesn't say the limit of what it can here and where it's being used, which is uh, alarming.

Speaker 1:          02:32:48       Could you imagine if it turned out that everything, every wire in everyone's house is secretly a microphone and the government has been years ahead with this data and tuning into everything you've said at every moment. All, all your life. So here's the microphone inside of the same, what? That little tiny thing is a microphone. Oh my God. And then where's your God now? Whoa. Serious. Leat kids. I bet he spells it. L three, three T. I don't know if I'll be able to find her. Three. Seven is three, three, seven

Speaker 5:          02:33:22       l seven three, three, one. Sorry, I can't, I don't know if I'm going to go to find this. I was like taking a shit while I was looking through this deep tweet. There's like 5,000 things in here now. So, but it's a scary thing. And the fiber, I didn't really know you could even hear audio through fiber that way. I know that it's used, um, like uh, the light cable you can use in the back of your any box. That little red light that's always on is looking for a fiber audio cable, which is the best, but

Speaker 1:          02:33:49       that's how it, Mike's Wick told me once, Mike Swick was working for the United States government in Russia and they had like a Russian ambassador, a Russian embassy building, you know, American US embassy building in Russia. And they had developed these devices that they found in the walls of the building that were powered by the movement of the building. Like cause the move, because it's a skyscraper would have a certain mass sway through the wind and they had figured

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       out to how to make a device that didn't require any sort of additional power source other than the movement of the building. Right. And it could transmit sound. They're like, this stuff is so far ahead of anything we knew even existed and they were using this in the building spine people. Mike Swick told me about that in like 2002 and it happened to him way before that, so we might be, you know who the fuck knows what they can, I mean John Edward Snowden does might be the reason why they kept that guy running like because they want to discourage anybody coming out. Now, at any moment we're going to find out that all of our phones are on 24 hours a day. Whether they're at of batteries are not that there's a certain amount of battery life. I think your phone retains and the government could listen.

Speaker 6:          02:35:04       They know where you are. The GPS tracker is tracking your phone, whether it's on or off everywhere you go. No, a lot of those phones actually do work with gps when the phone is on airplane mode. Oh yeah. Well it's just, yeah, yeah. There's a gps chip in your phone. That's why find your phone works. Like you can go on apple, find your phone. Hey, my phone's in the Bronx. Hey leave it there. Don't get shot. But listen, there's, that's how they can do that. They can find your Jamie once they take your eyes, man, if they give you those robot eyes, it's in the air pod. That's in the Apple Watch too. It's in all your apple computers. Lots everywhere. Yeah. How's that possible? Because she lives shit. Fuck. I like it. What if I try to lose me? So I'll tell you what. I'm digging these airpods I've been using it a lot like fucking awesome.

Speaker 6:          02:35:54       God, I was so skeptical. Look, I keep with me all the time too. Now. My favorite thing about them is that the case that, cause that's one thing I always had with Bluetooth headphones. I always like, fuck, I forgot to charge my head and look at this. [inaudible] welcome to the future pitches and I stick them in Miami and worry about them falling out. They don't really fall out. They're hard to fall out. I had to like hit it. I made them fall out of the gym when I was doing Chin ups because my shoulder's touched my ears and I made him fall out. And when one goes out, the other one stops. Yeah. Which is crazy. If you have the Apple Watch, which much? No. But then you don't need your iphone for music too much. You're using your phone. Got To draw lines. It's a better for jogging so you don't have your phone in your pocket when you're listening to music.

Speaker 6:          02:36:39       I have a fanny pack that is a neoprene waistband. My phone sits in there perfectly. Car Keys. It's extra weight, Bro. Not No problem. I don't mind. I'm stuck. I'm running with my dog. I'm not shaving any seconds. Do a lot of calling, trying to get him out of the bushes. My dog fucking loves it now. He still hates going in the car, but uh, he's more reluctant. He's less reluctant. He gets right up to the car cause he knows we're going to go run and he loves running. And then when we come back, a lot of times I give him a bath too. Oh, he loves that leash. No leash, man. He's a really good, he really listens. He'll wake me, obviously he's some fucking goofball

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       online. I posted a video and I was like a fool. I read through some of the comments. One of them said, don't let him get ahead of you bro. You're the alpha. And I'm like, look, I hope you're either joking around, maybe trolled me. You might've told me, but you might be just a dummy. I'm thinking you probably more of a dummy. No, I think your dog ahead of you when you walk on a leash, stupid or otherwise, you're not. Your dog's walking you. You dumb cunt. You know you're always going to be in the back. See the dogs in front. That's the other leash. That's where you're wrong, Joe. It has to walk next to you. I mean, cause that's what Cesar Milan tells people. I don't know. Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:37:56       He doesn't run. He's not running with his dog. I run with my dog. My top totally listens to me. And when he gets to far goals, stop dude. And he stops like he's smart. I go, come on back, buddy. I'm going to take a breather. Like he'll come back and hang out with me like he's, I don't let them off the leash. I liked the fact that he's, he likes to be free. He likes to run around. I want them to run around, let them have a good, he's a sweet dog. He's not going to be mean to anybody. You know, my, my new dog is, doesn't know how to use a leash and it's been trained to not use a leash, but I don't trust it so much because it's like one car honking his horn or something and he freaks out and runs into the traffic or something.

Speaker 1:          02:38:31       Yeah. When his cars, I always have him on a leash. Anytime there's cars that had him on a leash, but when I get out of the car and we go off into the trails, you know, I mean, if people see him, he's like the nicest dog ever. Anybody meets him. I was like, oh, he's so sweet. You know, so it's not like you have to worry about it being dangerous. He just likes to run around, man. It's fun to watch. It's like you're watching like a little dog, little kid. Why don't you bring him here so we can look at him? Well, because he's at home. I was like, Sabine is yard man. Go in the pool and swam. He swims whenever he wants too. That'd be funny if you were the new comic that always brings his dog everywhere. But you Brian Golden retriever. He's 75 pound dog everywhere.

Speaker 1:          02:39:08       Tales knocking people's drinks or ass hall. Can you fucking dog out of here man tales. So many people are so stupid with their dogs. Like their dog is like a baby. Like they can't leave it alone anywhere. Eliza can't leave it anywhere. No, Eliza's I've seen her without the dog occasionally. Yeah, he holds it. The husband, he clings onto that thing. She's a sweet dog. She's definitely a super, super loved and friendly dog. I Love Blanche. Yeah, she's awesome. I love dogs, man. You know what I mean? That's another, um, a good argument for not living in the city. Live somewhere where your dog can be free, you know, live somewhere. We can go out the back yard and throw a Frisbee for your dog, you know, go go on hikes, goddammit. Dumpy stuck in that red and white horror show of tail lights and headlight traffic. Fuck man. Yeah. What do you mean? What's that going to be like in 20 years and the skywalk? Shouldn't we be planning for that? You know that's just going to be in the sky. It's just going to be like 20 feet up. You might've been right with Santa Barbara. You know why I think you might've

Speaker 6:          02:40:14       been right because Santa Barbara's only an hour away so he'd go up there. It's an hour away. Important Shit. We could always come back to drive us in. Is that how that works then? Yeah, just has slightly honestly drives us in. Oh, one of them. Jammies. Yeah. Yeah. Is that going to happen? I think he's just doing la though. He's probably not going to do the Santa Barbara. Same County. Right. He's probably going to go right up to San Francisco. Have you heard of Tesla loop in Los Angeles where you can just rent a, it's like Uber. They said you have to go to San Diego, you rent a, somebody will drive a tesla for you and it's pretty cheap. Like $49 down to San Diego and you just ride in a tesla for 49 bucks. Pretty cheap uber type thing. I saw them. I want to got to the airport last time I was there. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:40:55       Testing nine bucks. The San Diego just talking about that seems super cheap. Yeah. How are they going to make money? Test a little loop. That's the thing is that new sports car, they came out with that new roadster goes 600 miles without a recharge. Now you're talking now I'm interested. Now I'm listening. 600 miles. Huh? Huh? Did he just not a top speed but fuck. Just go wherever you want to go. They go to Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, palm springs. That's crazy. Yeah, that's amazing. It's at $29 that's amazing. Smart. It's smart. It's free advertising for the cars. People get in and they're like, Holy Shit, this thing is nice. And then you see that guy giant dashboard and you go, Whoa, you got an ipad and you're down. What is that? Is it like a airplane seat? Your bias? You could be sitting with other people. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:41:42       Yeah. I mean it's $39 just by the seat next to have someone as far a bus that goes every day now from San Francisco to la, that's like a overnight sleeping bus. Were you sleeping a pod and they have like really? Yeah, that's not, that's obviously not the fastest way to do it, but if you need to go overnight and you kind have that time to rest was a driver stays away. Okay. That's the scary, I mean I hope the same with the pilot, but a driver sleeping, I don't know if it's a pilot, it's all shot on auto pilot. Pilot can adjust, but maybe those tests of buses, maybe a tussle bus like when them big ass, those, those big giant trucks that he's making now put pods in the back of the truck. There's only three or 500 miles though, right? So far? I think 500 miles Max one I think so you go, uh, you stop and San Luis Obispo.

Speaker 6:          02:42:27       I start carrying battery charge. How long they have to charge for. What is the distance in miles from La to San Francisco? If you had to guess? 800 and I don't know. No, no, no, no, not nearly, not nearly. I would say probably in the 400 it's like 420470470 you think? Yeah. Okay. I've never done it. Okay. You say 800? I say for 25. 600 you say for 75 you say 600. Okay. That's good. That's good bet. I don't think it's right though. I think it's way less. Is it from Los Angeles to San Francisco? Let's see. 381 82 miles from lawson. Wow. Interesting.

Speaker 6:          02:43:12       What's that mean? That means you have a raven bro. They got straight. Yeah. Straight. Then go above that. That's never heard that. Never heard of that. That's cool. Say that kind of talk. I'm used to it and I thought you fucking city slickers. Uh, that's good. Um, so yeah, a regular tesla can't do that. But they said the new one would be able to drive all the way there and back. That's not true. Cause that was one of their sayings. They said you could drive from San Francisco to La and back will. You definitely couldn't do that because that's more than 600. That's, that's more maybe the edge of the county. Maybe Carolee, let's lock. Stop lying. Stop lying. You gonna leave me stranded in the desert. I'm going to be somewhere halfway back where there's no water and that stupid piece of Shits gonna run out of batteries.

Speaker 6:          02:44:00       Stop lying. Just say it's awesome. It goes 600 miles. Don't say you can go to San Francisco and back. You can't, you shouldn't make it. They should make it a, the electric cars. They should make it wireless charging and then have the [inaudible] road speed. Like big mats. I think they've talked about too. Oh really? Yeah. I think they have talked about doing that. They've talked about having people in some sort of tracks where you know you can't change lanes unless like you're in a specific spot. And that that track charges the the lane up. It'd basically be in your own little trolley car. It's cool. Knows man. I think the idea of driving your own car though, that's on the way out for sure. I think we only have like a few, maybe a decade or so. More of that shit. Yeah. Mike, Mike Carr would just with the lane guidance, you know that's, I did it on the way here.

Speaker 6:          02:44:44       I barely drove off from Burbank to here just because of my link. My car just drives itself pretty much. I just have to put my finger on it so it knows that my fingers on it. What do you think, man? Do you think like, do you think people start moving out of la? You think people will realize that, look at this and go, this is unsustainable. I've got to get out now. What do you think? It'll take something like a fucking earthquake or something. Earthquake or thanksgiving. Hollywood continues to die. You know Hollywood's not going to continue to die. Now it with Youtube and people are doing it in their houses. You don't need to be in Los Angeles anymore. You could. That is true that people are making shitloads of money just from their fucking basement. That is true. I mean, and then the tech community is booming and other cities to like Seattle has a huge tech community.

Speaker 6:          02:45:28       You still have to come here though. So if you're only here for four or five days out of the month, what are you considering that, why would you have to come here? Work for a cooperate? I don't know if someone just wants to stay in La, you know what the fuck he saying? Listen to them. There's a reason why when youtube started, all the big people moved here. They didn't have to move here then they were all making money at home. They'd be like the glamorous thing to do. And Youtube does have offices here. The glamorous thing to do I think is part of it. Like come on, we're gonna move to La. If they made the officer's here though, cause everyone was here. That's right bitch. So well we're here. Why we're here. They go to the offices and he'd be here. Well, the one thing that keeps me, there's the comedy store, there's the podcast and having a great supply of guests and being around

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       all my friends, there's, this is the reasons to stay here, but we could just have our mass exodus. I've got to get everybody to make enough money when they could just pull up and bail. That's what everybody's got to be able to just pull up and bail and just like start a new community. We could just all move next to doug. Stan hope too much NYC and you don't, you're not going to sleep. You gotta make your own thing. I think we go to like Santa Ynez. We go to some weird cow country type place or people who have their own chickens. Yeah, that's the move. No where like that. The purge happens like that and then they had five years into it, everyone comes and just kills you and to like your city. Now it's a ghost town. Fucking be prepared, bro Brown kind of look all the cool shit in a cool city.

Speaker 1:          02:46:56       It's going to be like the dark tower movie. You gotta be prepared when they come. Let's just move the solving. That's not a bad spot. If you like to drink a lot of wine. Right. And listen to the ladies talk about the health problems and the yamas are llamas are, yeah, they have like Alpacas up there and they have to fight off the mountain lions. Mountain lions coming chapter. I'll pacos. Yeah, there's a, there's a bunch of amazing spots up the coast. You know, it's real interesting. We lost like hundreds of yards of a route. One a from a giant landslide and they still haven't figured out what the fuck to do. Yeah, it's still right till it still closed. Yeah. They're thinking about putting a road over the landslide, but they don't know when and they want to let it settle. Like, Hey, what? What do you do inward? A little were driving, if you're driving near that thing, he'd be like, oh my God. Oh my God, please don't fall please. And I'll fall like those 300 yards or whatever with a landfall was, look how big it is, late 2018 how far is it? How much of a, how much of a landslide is, oh, it's pretty far, dude. You gotta look out tiny. Those cars are, that's hundreds of yards for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:48:01       Doesn't, we'll pull up just so I could see it. It ruined 5 million cubic yards. Hold on. Go back up a little bit. 5 million cubic reigned. 5 million cubic yards of rocks and debris on the third of the mile. Okay, so it's one third of a mile. Wow. That's a lot. That's so big. You know, miles, 5,000 feet. Is that what it is? Three. So it's like Holy Shit. So they should go back to the photo again. Scroll down. So I could look at how big that fucking slide is. Just comes off the mountain. There's a before and after to where they show a, the two stages of the landslide. They show it before and then they show the second stage and then the third stage where it finally is. Now it's fucking crazy, man. Wow. Yeah. It's um, they have satellite images of what it looked like. See, look how much fell off, man.

Speaker 1:          02:48:55       Look at that. Boom. Just so what do you have to do now? You just can't even go anywhere near there. Oh No, don't drive there. It's kind of keep following some of these houses right there. Two guys. Fuck I'm screwed. He's so fucked. It's going to keep falling like more parts are going to fall and they think part of it is the root system isn't strong enough to keep the uh, the, the, you know like the more trees and roots you have, the less likely it is to have the landslides I guess because the trees and the root system keep all the dirt. So then if you have poor rainfall then the, the trees don't grow as much and I have as much weeds. You don't have as much shit on the side of the hill. And then there's like, you ever seen me drive by Malibu and they got like cement all up on the side of certain hills and like mash and shit to keep things from falling. I these people like holding onto their chunk of dirt with every tooth and claw.

Speaker 9:          02:49:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:49:50       Yeah. It's supposedly like a lot of places because of all the fires. Like this winter it's going to be land law, mudslides everywhere for for us. That's what I've heard. Yeah. Yeah. Burbank. They say that the fire, one thing that the fires are good for though. It's like you need to burn some of that shit down and it's supposed to be healthy, puts minerals in the soil and then it builds things back up and then these fires through like lightening strikes are like super common and then the things were burned down and the rain would come and then they would repopulate with new new seeds and shit. She, this guy figured out how to put together. You could stand on it. Yeah. Yeah. The car on it. Yeah. He put pieces of paper in between the sand and then he pulled the sides off of it and the paper, the paper being compressed in between these pieces of sand allows it to hold tremendous weight without losing its form. Weird. Yeah. It's super weird. See how it is. It's like each thing is like a slice,

Speaker 9:          02:50:43       right?

Speaker 1:          02:50:44       Like see if they show how he did it. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. It's just sort of how it works. Similar how side of it. That means you said the side of a freeway. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:50:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:50:56       So that's what they do with the side of the freeways thing. That's how they reinforce those things. Yeah. If you see him slowly build it up, it's kind of crazy to watch them do it. But dude, I watched something really crazy. You ever go to the, if you hi, I started falling it cause you retweeted it. Yeah. If you go to, if you high, they have a thing where they're building a bridge and they're moving a fucking gigantic girder and his girl, there's like a hundred yards wide and they're picking it up. Look at this, this thing, it's a machine. It goes to the end of the bridge where the edge is cause they're, they're building the bridge, it stops and then this other thing comes down and then it moves forward and then connects. It connects with the other side. You've seen this. This is sweet. Fuck Dude. It's crazy. So it connects to the aside. Extends and then once it does that, then they bring in this huge cement girder. I mean it is fucking, you see how small the people look next to it. It's fucking huge. This is cool. It's like a football field, right? I mean isn't it, is that close to a football field? How far is that? At least half of one if not at least 50 yards. Right. 50 yards of solid and steel.

Speaker 6:          02:52:06       It's huge. And they set it down on top of these stone pillars and everybody must be shitting their pants. Go do and we'll get you on up here. Where's this? Japan? China, I don't know. Asian while joint machinery company. I mean that's how they do it man, right at soc. The crazy thing is to think that they built the Brooklyn Bridge back when when they built that God damn thing. When did they build the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge? When the fuck did they build that thing? I mean that was a long goddamn time ago and I think still up so weird. The idea of building over water till you have to like go to the point where you can drive a car over. Yeah, it's nuts. 1933 the Golden Gate Bridge was built. Whew. That's crazy. How long did it take them people back then? Worked harder. There were different. Did stronger hands? What? How? How many years do you think that took the bill? I want to say it took two years. I say five years. What do you say, Jamie?

Speaker 6:          02:53:08       I don't know. At least 10 10 hmm. Easily. Okay. Let's see. I think I'm right. I think it's like two years. What'd you say, Brian? Five to five. 10 all right. How long did it take? How many workers? What do we got? 35 million bucks. That's it. Shit. That's like j Lo's house. Things you may not know I'm on. Why don't you just google? How long did it take determined? How long did it take? How long did it take to build the Golden Gate Bridge for a half years? Oh yes. Four and a half years. You went over, Bro. It doesn't count. You went too far. I ain't go right. Isn't that a price is right word go over 21 no, you said hit me and you fucked up. I go, I couldn't with one on one. Yeah, you could have one with one with one because I had to, so I was closer with one day.

Speaker 6:          02:54:08       You want a one? Yeah, you would have one that would have, you would have got that. We're not playing by those rules. That's amazing that they built it that quick back. Then think of that like less than five years. They built this incredible bridge that's still up. Why they did it in the stone age. It's a lot more slaves back then. You know, they weren't, they probably were though. Right? The Chinese people that built the railroads, they weren't technically slaves, but they weren't going anywhere either. The Brooklyn Bridge was in 1870 we did it first started in 1870 beginning. That's a technically 1869 because it was January 3rd. You know what's interesting about that? They're tearing down a bridge in downtown La Right now. Um, the sixth street bridge. Yes. Did it last year, I think. Yeah, they're there. They're rebuilding it because it has something called concrete cancer. Like the concrete was rotting out. Like how these dummies do such a shitty job. Goddamn la thing. Bridge smoked a lot. Ah, all the fucking shitty traffic and bad, bad air. Imagine if that like pollution actually destroyed concrete.

Speaker 3:          02:55:15       Yeah. Policing has been bad this year in Los Angeles.

Speaker 6:          02:55:18       Wow. Beautiful Bridge.

Speaker 3:          02:55:20       Last night we were on a no chimney. We weren't allowed to use fireplaces. If you had a fireplace,

Speaker 6:          02:55:25       it didn't seem weird. They can't just fix that. Yeah. It doesn't seem weird. I mean, I guess it makes sense if it's the concrete starting to break down, just what a shit design can you get your money back? You know, that was built in 1932. That's what was always said to those nine 11 troopers. You know, like everybody was, uh, they were pissed at this guy that owned tower seven that, you know, he said pull it, pull the building. You know, when I was driving crazy, like, why didn't that Guy Freak out? That building just collapsed. That was my building and it lit on fire. Just collapse like that. I'm like, who the fuck design this piece of shit? Like look at the building. Look how collapsed. Like, did you guys not know that? Maybe it could catch fire. Did you plan? You didn't plan for that. Okay, well you make me a new building, motherfucker make it so they can light on fire and I can just rebuild it. So make it so collapses shit about the extended warranty. The apple care insurance. Right. That's what, that's what those conspiracies about that he told them to pull the building. I have it all collapse.

Speaker 3:          02:56:27       Taller insurance companies alive, you know like look at all the houses in Puerto Rico and Texas and all that stuff that happened this year. How has like nationwide still fucking not running out of money? That's a good question. That's a very good question. Yeah, I mean that's a lot like the cars. You see a lot of cars of all the cars that got ruined for in Houston, like judge like thousands of cars and you can't do anything with those cars. You can't sell those cars. No. And one if they can even use the frames. I mean the frames might be rotten Rustin shit, everything. 1 million cars and Houston and they're saying that a lot of them are being sold in like Los Angeles and stuff. People are buying them and trying to clean them up to make them look like they fine. Well I wonder if you could as rewire them.

Speaker 3:          02:57:20       No, there's, I mean there's so much like mold and stuff in there and all of a mechanic now I saw, I think I saw a thing on it on the news like, like why they can't use them. I forget what his car got flooded when, when like in the 90s when it flooded in Ohio, we lived on the bottom of the hill. Whole shit flooded. A lot of people's houses are owned. Car was fucked and didn't even get that much water in it. Wow. Here's total it. Shouldn't they made a car that you can get wet? Yeah, like a little waterproof car. You can drive it in the lake, but like, no one ever wanted that piece of shit like member when they couldn't do that with the iphone. So like there's no work can make a waterproof. Right. Well that's one thing to raise. Your phone's not waterproof. It's not. Nope. Nope. Nowadays,

Speaker 6:          02:57:57       yeah. Nowadays you need that. But it does have a, um, the power button right here. It's also a thumb print sensor sensor. Yeah. I mean, it's a beautiful phone. It's, it's weird how the designs, I can't square, like, it's a, what's the battery life on it? Phenomenal. It's 4,000 Milli amps or using it as your main phone right now. No. Hmm. No. Mostly using it to play games on fuck around with it. Yeah. Just, yeah. It's, the sound is amazing when you play music on, it's fucking incredible. The game. And it's supposed to be bad ass. Like watching a youtube video, like it's fucking loud. Like you're watching it on a laptop with really good screen speakers turned out in the 120 hertz. Right? Yes. That's the other thing is that it's one of the very few, um, cell phones that has 120 rate a hertz frame rate that's crew fringe.

Speaker 6:          02:58:43       So it means that you get 120 frames per second sometimes, you know, depending upon the game, which is like Super Silky smooth. If you're playing something like, and you're watching video and think most things, it's not gonna be able to take advantage of it, but games, a lot of games can cause this out yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Dude, there's a lot of, there's one called a, I was watching unblocks therapy on blocks, unbox therapy. He, uh, Lewis had a, an article or a video rather on the one fte. Is that it? Yeah. Five t is that it? One plus five team is that, I say it, see if that's the right thing to say. But that thing looks fucking incredible. The big one. Yeah. And it's, uh, it's half the price of like a, a galaxy note. Eight or $299 500 bucks. 500 bucks plus five.

Speaker 6:          02:59:28       Yeah. The thing. So, so like my point was that the level of cell phone, look, look, your iphone x 10 sorry, sorry. Nervous, don't get mad. It's x doin bro or even you know any of the new, the new Google pixels, the level's so high now. Everything the Samsung note. So like these everything is like I was watching a video comparison and there are nitpicking. I mean these guys are nit picking, try to find anything wrong with any of these phones and like these things are like they're, they're literally like science fiction from 10 years ago, 10 years ago. The things that these things can do, the opens with your face, you look at it and it opens the one ft has that too. Yeah. One plus my note has it, my note eight. It does have that or whatever. Yeah. I mean he has it but it's not, it's the same level.

Speaker 6:          03:00:15       Like you have to like stick it in your face and be like do like if that was the thing that the note has a retina detection, which is different. This is facial recognition. And then the one plus ft has an even better version of [inaudible] facial recognition than the iphone. And Louis was showing a quick, it opens this. Oh Wow. Maybe pan. Yeah. And it also has a fingerprint sensor in the back, which the iphone doesn't have. Yeah. And a big ass screen. It's got a big ass green, a little tiny ass bezels look smooth, like the level, my point is just super high right now. We're dorks like you and me. Very lucky. And they're saying the next year one, they're already guessing at what nick next year's. I don't fold. You know, they, they got a patent for folding fold, which is cool in some ways.

Speaker 5:          03:01:00       Like imagine having like a normal size phone, but then you could fold it and make it an ipad. You know what I mean? Apparently they're really close to doing something like that

Speaker 1:          03:01:09       and that's, I think there's at one point in time they're gonna figure out a way to put it in your, in your glass.

Speaker 5:          03:01:16       Yeah. I think it's going to be more like, like glasses or even just like a contact lens that you never take out. Kind of like

Speaker 1:          03:01:22       dope sunglasses, like some cool like frame, like Elton John's style frames and you have like just a full screen computer playing a virtual reality in front of you all the time. Yeah. That might be the way to go.

Speaker 5:          03:01:35       I can't believe Google glasses didn't really take off too much stuff that good. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:01:39       it was too small. You were looking at it. I tried it once. I did it. I've worn during one of the UFC wayans here. Um, you're looking at this little thing over here and you look down, you could see it and you can look up and you don't, you kind of look past it but it's kind of, there wasn't right. It wasn't the right thing. I think augmented reality where you either looking through your phone or you have glasses on, like that's what I think you're going to have like clear glasses on and you're going to have your phone and you're going to be able to do is switch to glass mode and your phone will be in your pocket and it'll bluetooth with the glasses and the glasses will be able to pull up anything. That was the other thing that's pretty crazy about, um, some of the new google devices. You take a photo of something and it tells you what that thing is. Like you take a photo of the coliseum and it'll say there's the colosseum in Rome. You're like, what? Yeah, the new pixel does. It has that built in. This isn't, how about this. They have this thing called the pixel book. We've seen the pixel book. You buy a pen and you circle things on a screen and it tells you what those things are.

Speaker 5:          03:02:34       Yeah. My it has that. Yeah. My no aid. My note eight. You can just circle like a sentence and it will translate it on four year, dude. Yeah, it's pretty second how long

Speaker 1:          03:02:44       for that becomes just standard, you know, and how much we're going to get to some sort of Rosetta stone type situation where we can read each other's thoughts. Like you'll be able to just talk. I mean, right now the note taking software is pretty damn good. It's pretty God damn good. Like if you talk into your phone, whether it's with Google notes or anything else with apple notes, it'll pick up your voice very, very well. But what, what is it going to be like in five years from now? It's going to be incredible. And you're gonna be able to do it in real time like they're doing with those ear buds, those Google earbuds, you know, they're gonna be able to do that in real time all the time. And so there's going to be no language barriers than anybody ever has with anybody else. It's amazing, isn't it weird? Yeah, it's crazy. And then when you have the robot fights between the robot fights and no language barriers.

Speaker 5:          03:03:29       Yeah. Arrange. What is this? I saw this at twitchcon. Is this eye tracking new? Uh, it's replaces your mouse basically using your eyes. Yeah. It's a little sensor that's on the bottom right below your, uh, right below your screen. Kind of like where the folders on your laptop basically. And you do a little bit of setting up and it literally tracks everything you're looking at. Oh my God did it really well. I saw, I saw a little test right in front of me. Well, that worked for games. That's the idea.

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       If you're a tired though, maybe you bitch, that'd be insane. You imagine if you got that down to games and your, your, your cursor moved exactly where you wanted to go. It might be too easy be fucking people up with that.

Speaker 5:          03:04:11       Wait a second. This is, is this an old video? Because it just said like, they were just advertising the head u s 2.09 instead of 3.0 I just works over two point doesn't need 3.0 I see.

Speaker 1:          03:04:21       Wow. Tagged your enemies by glancing at them. Boom, boom. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          03:04:27       Yeah. So whether or not games actually needed or it becomes, uh, something actually useful in the future. We'll see. But that's just, it's been announced and that's coming soon or it's out now. Some alienware laptops that think or having it built into it.

Speaker 1:          03:04:40       I do not even with my eyes, daymond my eyes. Just forget the face of your father. Yeah, we're, I mean, we're at the cusp of some really wacky virtual reality, augmented reality type shit that's just around the corner. It's going to happen. It's going to take us by storm and it's going to be just like all these other things that we use, like automatically wouldn't even think about it because before twitter existed that you didn't even think about it before podcasts existed, you'd never even thought this would could be a possibility. That's going to be the new one that's going to, that's going to be fucking crazy. Some augmented reality type shit that you were then eventually they're going to have the robot eyeballs. Brian's going to go, he's going to be an early adopter. I do. One of them starts hard, worn glasses can read my phone.

Speaker 5:          03:05:24       I've lost my glasses but I would do one first if if after a few years of testing and stuff like that. But uh,

Speaker 1:          03:05:31       what did you do one and try one out? I think there's gonna be a bunch of options. I think there's going to be options in terms of like augmented parts and then I think there's also going to be options in terms of like dumb being able to regenerate parts. I think that's just around the corner too cause they already being, they can regenerate a lot of shit now with stem cells. They grew a woman's bladder. They made a bladder with skin cells and grew. She had bladder cancer, they grew her a new bladder.

Speaker 5:          03:05:57       There was that guy that's growing a new nose on his forehead. Have, do you see that? Is that from the same thing from stem cells? Jesus. And it's weird like on his 40 [inaudible] he has a nose growing or it's an ear and he's growing it for him. His nose

Speaker 1:          03:06:10       let us do that for, I don't know where hats, no one would know. I saw a dude. We're a video rather, where dude was getting, there we go. Oh Jesus. It's going to have a crazy knows guide one.

Speaker 5:          03:06:23       That's so weird. It looks fake, but it's on national geographic's. Yeah, it's real. What's wrong with his regular knows it. I think

Speaker 1:          03:06:31       some, I forget what happened. Wow, that's so strange. Oh, it looks like it was burnt, man. That's, that's another really crazy thing. Have you ever seen what they do with, um, with a skin that's been burnt now? They spray stem cells, all of the skin and it kills the burns and a regenerates fresh tissue in those areas and you don't have a scar. That's sweet. That's like science fiction. I mean that's literally out of star wars

Speaker 6:          03:06:56       or something. Like when you see it, they, they, they show people with these like really bad third degree burns are pretty fucked up and they spray this stem cell mist all over them and then their skin just regenerate tissue, like sweet feeling. Yeah. But it's really, essentially we're talking about something that had just a decade or two ago would be absolutely witchcraft. You know, fuck man. And they're, they're blocking it to like, we could be farther ahead in this whole field if they let stem cell shit be little bit more legal here now then it then it used to be, but I think the real issue was during the Bush administration, I think it was like fetal stem cells they had a problem with, they're really worried that people are going to get abortions just on purpose so they could sell the babies to stem cell places and that people would be as super immoral and just have a bunch of abortions and make money off the baby tissue. I was like, Ooh. Which it tells my son. So that's the problem, right? The problem has like, like no, nobody would do that. Yes they would. Motherfucker hasn't been approved yet. So put it on paypal. Jane's crimes when you're waiting forever. Ah Dude. If you got burnt and they offered it to you, take it. There's videos. The videos are good.

Speaker 6:          03:08:15       Just here's the thing. All the people that are like crazy conspiracy theorists and worried about science and Ugh, you got to realize that science is responsible for this kind of shit. Science might be able to save one of your kids. Science might be able to fix your body. These people are smarter than us. We need to respect them and they're not lying about this stuff. Yeah. There's people in the medical industry that make a lot of money off of pharmaceutical drugs at a bunch of things that make people super addicted and fuck up your life. There's that too. But there's also this, it's like, it's not perfect. You should definitely call out the parts that are bad, but you kind of respect the people that are smarter than us that are making all the awesome shit. Cause it's not you and it's not me. Right.

Speaker 6:          03:08:59       But Jesus, Joe, Jesus made the people that made the awesome shit. So there, I'll give you that. How about that? We'll leave it up, uh, and walk away. Friends. Ah, you got to show big show is tonight. Tonight. Yeah. Thomas Shore. Asher, Marilyn rights. Got a bunch of people bringing Shoub Brendan Schaub. Um, Lucas Lucas our, yeah. Well my watch and my Watkins Pat Reagan. Oh Shit. Going to be fun is that, that's an Iot comedy store. And then tomorrow I'm doing Sam Tripoli show that's in the main room. That's got a bunch of killers on it to good times. Ah, this weekend, Detroit, I think shows are sold out. I don't know. I should pay more attention, but we'll be back tomorrow with ct Fletcher and Brian Callen. It's a fucking double header day. No, I won't let Brian Cowen ruined ct flushes interview. Don't worry. CTB be by himself then. Brian Count will be later. Ah.
