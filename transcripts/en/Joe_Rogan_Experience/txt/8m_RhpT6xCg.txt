Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Headphone sir. Do I have him there? Better lock in. I would live. Hey Andrew. I do it. I'm good. How are you? I'm good man. What's up, chilling, man. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. Of course. Of course. I like. What are you doing? Thank you. I like a lot of things. Are you doing a, first of all I liked that you're, you decided to put all your shit on Youtube. Yes. Fuck it. Fuck it. Look, it's hard. There's about a million fucking comedians today, right? There's more comedians now than ever these off. Is that a locking door? There's like a million comedians today. Yeah. And a lot of these companies are overwhelmed. You have no room for all these up and coming guys that are coming up and you know some, some guys like you are really good and there's, they're looking, you know, like how do you, how do you get your shit out there?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Well it just put it out there on Youtube. Exactly that. Yeah. I mean everybody just said No. To me that was a thing. So I didn't have a choice. Well a lot of people that's happened in the Brian Cowen right now. Right. And then he just did his right. Posted his thing, but he's releasing it on iTunes. He's releasing it on all the other platforms, but there's no fucking room. Yeah. It's, it's a weird thing because, uh, I guess for me, you know, the, the standard industry wasn't really inviting to me even from the beginning. So a couple of years ago I filled my own and especially when I did it in New York and I did the five clubs and I did the cab rides in between and the idea was, all right, if you don't fuck with me, at least you can appreciate this part of stand up that is being a New York guy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Did you do 15 minutes sets in this place? Oh Wow. That's cool. Yeah. So it was like, I was like, if you love the game, yeah, you at least we'll take a look at this and maybe support this. Right. And everybody said No. Like Cecil said, no. Whoa. And I had a show with them, like, like Bro, it was humbling, you know, and uh, but I just believed in the project and I thought it was dope. So I cut like a, I could have 15 minute version, but I'll tell you what I did is because, uh, you can learn everything you would need about standup from asking people who don't do stand up. Really? Yeah. Like I asked all my friends and just people I would meet, I'll be like, well, you watching these days and you know, they'd say the names that we all know and then they'd always say this, they'd be like, uh, yeah, it was, it was funny man, but I didn't finish it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Everybody said that. Right. And I was like, all right, so as too long. Yeah. So I cut it down to 15. I did like a 15 minute version of the special ed for clubs and I just put it right on to youtube. And, um, it was weird. I liked sold out shows that we can as San Diego and I was never a sellout guy. You know, I have a few guys come out from the podcast I do and that kind of stuff, but it was never like a, like a sellout, you know? And I was like, well that's kind of weird. And then I did a show in like Columbus, Ohio, you know, the, the, what is it? The funny bone out there, a great club, great club. And um, I think we sold like 1600 tickets and I was like, what the fuck is happening? Like I was never, not in Ohio, you know, and

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       like people are coming out and like, I liked your thing. I was like, Oh shit, maybe people are, are watching this. And I started to kind of like sit back for a second. I was like, why are people watching man? Maybe it's short. And I was like, all right, fuck it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to put a joke out a week for a year. You know, I got another 45 minutes left to the special and I could probably produce some more stand up. I'll just put a joke out a week. There was this singer who is doing that and like he just put a song out a week, his name is Russ. And I was like, all right, that's, he's a worker. I can, I can at least control that. I can outwork somebody. So I'll do that. And uh, I put the choke out for a weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       Like the jokes are to go and like someone would go viral and I was like, Yo, this is crazy. And people would come out to shows and in my youtube guy hits me, he goes, Yo, something weird is happening. I go, what's up? And he goes, when people watch a clip to watch for two hours, I go, do you mean like they'll just get lost in a wormhole? And I go, so wait a minute. So people aren't watching an hour of stand up on the networks because it's too long, but they're watching two hours of mine. I'm like, why the fuck would that happen? And we figured out that it was, you made the choice when you are in control of your destiny, right? You invest as much time as you. One is hitting snooze on the alarm clock so that I'll take another eight minutes, I'll take another eight minutes. I won't set my alarm clock for an hour later. Yeah, that would be irresponsible. But I'll snooze snooze, snooze and when people make their own fucking choice, it was like, it was just crazy to see what happened man.

Speaker 3:          00:04:34       It's also the platform, the platform, you people on their phones. Uh, Netflix told me that half the people that watch my special watch on a four course. Absolutely. So people that are watching phones, they're there. You're, you're on that goddamn thing all day long and it's way easy to flip a channel. It's ways you just, you got that remote in your hand anyway. Yeah, that's a really good point. When you're on your phone, you're going full screen. You got to like tap it, move it

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       and you don't know what's next. I know if I turned this channels ESPN too. Exactly. I don't know if I leave this video, what I'm going to see next. Yeah, 100% little

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       bit of that. There's a little bit of phone addiction that contributes to a lot of views, but people love fucking youtube. Youtube never ends. You could be on it for the rest of your life and not put a dent in the content that's on there. I mean, it's a space. Yes. Especially if you have like me, I got a lot of weird interests. Like you look at like what it suggests for me, it's like shit on the cosmos, muscle cars, professional pool matches, MMA. It's chaos. The archery elk hunting and shit. It's crazy. Like I could never leave my fucking house, just sit with my phone plugged in the wall and just on my birthday and shit to you, right? Oh yeah. And they were like, yeah, I do want to check that out. Soon as they did that, I, I saw this when back when there was no suggestions. Remember those days? Of course, the dark day. Yeah. Well as soon as they start suggesting shit, I was like, oh my God, that's a, that's a game changer. And then the next video just automatically plays like, ah, you got us.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       Yes, it's over. It's like, it's just right there. You have all your access points to it, you know? Yeah. I mean that, that was the beauty of it. I found. It's like, you know, with a special your fee, you're maybe the best joke that you have on your special to someone else is 33 minutes in. So that guy has got a wait 33 minutes hoping you're gonna hit that joke right on youtube. Like if I had your special, not cut it up to jokes on Youtube, what topic? Not, you know, everything under an umbrella, you know, and you have an access point here you have let's say six different access points with a new special I have out now. Right? It's, it's six different pieces. So as a different access point every single time, some people might come for a Trump joke, some people might come for a trainee joke.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       It doesn't matter. Right? So it's not the situation where you have to go, okay, maybe I hit 37 minutes in this bit that I love. No, you're going to get that bill right away. And then you're going to go back to the beginning and go, okay, I'm going to watch this all the way through. It's the music model. Like for me, I didn't invent anything. I just stole it from music. Musicians put out a single for a reason. I, I kinda, I like that. If you thinking about marketing, yes. Complete, complete. Like you and I are and way different places with standup. Right? Like you're one of the most famous people in the world, right? So you don't need to find new people to see you. People are going to watch your standup because they're like, all right, I have an intimate relationship with this guy. I listened to him eight hours a week and I just want to see his standup. Right? I'm still in marketing phase. I'm like, how can I get New People to see me? There's five people that should have comedy specials now that's more, there's five Jeff out to get lighters. Do Rock, Chappelle, Louis [inaudible]. That's it. Everybody else should be an acquisition face. Why? I don't know

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       both up man. I don't know. I don't buy into that. I don't know. First of all, I don't think that way. I never worry about it with other people are doing. I just don't think about it. And then to all I concentrate on is doing my best shit. That's it. Right. And once I got to a point where I was successful enough where I didn't have to worry about money, it was a huge relief. And honestly I think I started doing my best work of course, because then I wasn't thinking, I didn't have any resources that were dialed into how do I promote this and how do I get that going? All my resources like this bit needs something more. I've got to figure out how to really sell that. I know I got to put maybe if I switched it around and so it's all about alchemy. Yeah. You know, it's all about adding shit and trying to make gold. All I'm doing is like starring in the lab, trying to make goals. And you love creating though. Yeah. Well I don't have, there's no thoughts on marketing now, but that's, you found that you love creating. Yeah, for sure. I've always loved creating. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:48       People. Some people don't know that. Like some, I feel like success teaches you exactly what you wanted. Like these people who blow up with standup and never do it again. Yeah. They never wanted to be a standup. Right, right, right, right. It's like if you blow up and all you're thinking about is how do I make this toe knuckle hair joke better? You love the game. You're like, I don't know. The greatest thing that ever happened for me was I stopped desiring things I couldn't control. Right. Like I realized, Oh, I don't care about a special on HBO or Netflix. I just wanted people to see it. Right. And if they see it and 10 people see it, that's cool because I just loved making it and if a million people see it, that's also cool. But if anybody sees it as gratitude, right. Do you see what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:09:31       Like before I was just this void, like so many, so much of us are like comics. I was just like trying to fill up, you know, like I'm sure you get people asking to be on the show and all that shit on it all the time and like, it's just comics trying to take fill themselves. Like, and I was entitled Little Fucking Brat Probably. Why don't I have a special one on one? I have this, there's a lot of that going on. It's useless bro. But I couldn't, you know how like every rich person goes, uh, money doesn't make you happy and every poor person is like, man, when I'm rich, I'm gonna be happy. Yeah. I feel like it's like dad, like I needed to get a certain amount of success for me to realize, man, I just love making these things.

Speaker 3:          00:10:10       Everybody does. It's like everybody does. And if you don't, if you don't mean you're, you're either blessed or stupid. You're like one of those things. It's, it's either, hey, the year this guy, this is pure, or a woman who's pure right from the job and you just, you're just all about creating. But it's really just about, you know, I was talking to shop about it, that we were at the comedy store. We were about to go on Sundays. I'm like, how fun is killing killing's the most fun? I don't understand how people could quit this. He quit doing comedy. Matt, how? How, why would you quit? I'm like got all the shit that I do. If they said you could only do one, I be like a comedy. Everything else I could just pretend I'm doing. They know whether it's a UFC commentary, I just sit at home and watch TV and just talk about what someone's supposed to be.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       You can't fake it. Right. Cafe comedy, you can fake literally everything else. Everything else. You can't fake Kylen.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       Yeah. You and I can have the same fucking conversation with probably would if there was no cameras, no people. If you and I would just chilling in the main room, green room with the colonies store, we probably have the same conversation. Facts hundred percent. Yeah. But when you go up there, that is a, that is a precision art form that requires calculation and also zen like smoothness and Alpha flow. You got to be in the zone. You got to be in that flow state. You gotta be happy, but you also gotta be focused. Yeah, that'd be having a good time. But concentrating on these people and, and projecting to them and you want them to have a good time. You know, the whole deal is one of the best things about this job is you're making people feel good. Yes. You're, you're there coming out of their house to see you and they come out of there feeling

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       better. They have a good time. Yeah. If everything goes right, they feel better. They, in my mom, my mom said the exact same things that you're very lucky you get to make people feel good for a living ethical job. Yes. Like how rare is that imagining he's like insurance guys as to like tell people they can't get their bills paid from their car accident because it was their fault. Or imagine if you like, oh one of those big tobacco guys you driving around or Rolls Royce knowing that someone's on an iron lung somewhere. Someone's, there's the lighter knowing someone's drowning in their own fluid. Yeah. You feel like shit, I need to just fly me to noon. Let me play among the stars. It's like is bullfighting. Yeah, that's what we do. It's somebody said it so well he's like, cause people used to always make the boxing analogy and I hated that because I used to box a little bit and like I never at all felt that it was similar. Like I've never heard a boxer go, yeah this is just like stand up. It is like a martial art in that the truth is what works. I'll go on that

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       because in martial arts if you like the in particularly in martial arts, not just in boxing, boxing is a martial art, but the only stuff that works is the stuff that works. And if you hit a guy and he goes unconscious, it doesn't matter. One of the things that I used to like about fighting was that everybody could hate me and I didn't care. I didn't care. Because when I got in there and I'm like, I knew that I was going to fuck that guy up. It doesn't matter what his friend's thing. It doesn't matter how loud, loud his parents cheer. I'm going to kick that dude and his head and I'm going to separate him from his consciousness Taco and that's just going to happen and there's nothing you can hate me all day long. It doesn't matter. But then I had to switch gears 100% into comedy and I thought there were so different.

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       And then I realized because in comedy you have to get the people to like you, right? You can't just have these ideas and be unlikable. Can't you get them to respect you? But they got to like you. They, I mean you can get them to respect me. Even respect is liking you. Like do you have to be, someone could say one thing like there's like the late great Brody Stevens who just passed. If you looked at Brody's material on paper, some of it wasn't funny and when you looked at it in real life, it was some of my best material that I ever saw anybody do. Right. Because Brody's personality was so likable and he was so funny on stage that you just wanted to laugh at him. It just, he figured out that, yeah, it's, yeah, and when I was starting out, I didn't have that. I was, I couldn't, I didn't, I had a hard time making that switch. Then once I get better, I got better at standup. I realize like, oh there's, it's so similar because either it's funny or it's not funny take either it works or doesn't work and your job is not like some comics get, they get caught up in their image, they get caught up in how they want the audience to think of them

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       and they dress a certain way on purpose because they want to project this image. And they'll even say things on stage that are kind of gross that they're the only saying it because they want the audience to think they're cool. Right. And it gives you a little like ill, but maybe they're good enough so that you seal lad everybody, Eh, cds, authenticity, illuminates all those comics can't follow a real comic. Right. Did you ever notice that when you see someone who's being truthful, he might not even be as funny, he might not be killing as hard, but it's so authentic that when the comic comes next it feels like they're reading jokes off a paper. Right. And it's, our bodies are keyed into like comedies reptilian if you do it right. Right. You know like a lot of times people will ask like why? Like old women can laugh at the same jokes that I'm telling it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       Like these young people can laugh at and then my response is always, it's not their choice. Like I'm not telling you jokes to your choice. Like the daily show, Trevor Noah is jokes about how you want the world to be. I'm telling you jokes about how you deep down feeling is going at your gut. It's reptile shit. So it's like if it's in here already, you're going to laugh for girls, how old you are, regardless of how you were raised. This is how you feel. And I think it's why you guys love 'em Diaz so much. Do you know what I mean? It's like he doesn't happen to how to not be himself. He's like, I like, he's like a, what is he Latino? What kind of land? He's a Cuban Larry David. Do you know what I mean? It's just like, like what does Larry David, the whole show is what if someone was authentic 24 hours a day?

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       What was Patrice raw authenticity 24 hours a day and we're drawn to that in its worst form and it's best for them, but we're fucking drawn to that and like there's something beautiful that that, that's why I always use the bullfighter analogy. It's like the bull for me is the premise. It's not the crowd. The crowd is still the crowd. It's like how close can I get to this dangerous premise and I don't want to box with it. I want to dance with it. I want it to put his nose up against my nose and then I want to secure it, but before I skewer it, I want to fucking do that shit where I click my heels and I do the Little Cape and I'm going to entertain the fuck out of the crowd with this dangerous substance. That's what the fuck we do. That's why we roll our eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       When we see the pandering shit, we're like, what are you wasting this for? Exactly the fucking superpower. Well, I think we're in this weird time period. You know there's an ebb and a flow to comedy and right now it's the weirdest airb because right now you have this weird comedy that it's, people are saying things that they want the crowd to here rather than saying things that are funny. They're saying things to hit all these check points of progressive thinking as cis white male, I believe. I don't say that word to me. I mean it's like shit ain't real. It's not real. Like the special I have on now is called views from the sis. Yeah. It's a playoff of Drake album called views from the six. But the idea is just like, yeah, he's a straight guy views. Yeah. Yeah. This is what the world needs right now.

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       Well, you know the world needs authenticity. Whether it's authenticity from a trans person or authenticity from a straight guy, the world needs someone to go out there and say what the fuck? They really thinking have a, a well measured take on things and that's what I see you're doing. What you're doing is you're, you're going out there, you're expressing yourself and the great thing about being turned down by all these platforms as they can't censor you. Yes. They're not going to tell you, hey Andrew, we really like you, but um, tranny we can't have tran. You can't say that on our, no, why not? Well, I was like, how come you can say cabby but you can't say tranny. Granny. Granny joke I have is transgender training grandmother. Granny. It's, yeah. How is this bad? Right out. What is happening? We see it's kind of cute bro.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       It's, we do it out of love. Yeah. If we shorten something and add a y, it's affectionate sort of. What's not. Uh, if you pull your me talking shit to someone to call him shorty. Hey fucking shorty ready? Yeah. That's longer shorty as longer. Yeah. That's why Blackie's wrong. Right, right. So it's like this, the logic is there is in trouble. Right? SORTA Japs. What about it? That's not good. But Japanese cute Jap Jews. He's talking about Japanese people. Oh, calm the Japs first. Yeah. Why is that bad? Well, it's bad because that's how the soldiers used to talk about them and the people just talk about them during World War II when they were at war with them. So here's my question. What if somebody was like, you know, as one of the most refined cultures and delicious cuisine that I've ever experienced these jobs. That's right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       That, you know, dance is the best. The spics, these beats we dancing, probably disagree with that. Can fucking dance. Isn't it intention, right? Like is it 10? Yes. So I was talking to this, there was a, there, there was a, there's a trans chick that got upset at the joke and she was like, you know, she basically said to me, she's like, how you know, you probably wouldn't like it to if as you were walking home at night, someone called you trainee and then threw a bottle at you. And I was like, I'm out. Respond to the negative comments. But all I'm thinking is if you were walking home at night and someone said transgender and then threw a bottle at shoe, I think it'd be equally upsetting. Yeah, right. It's not what the word is. It's like there are certain

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       words that are made to make you feel bad. The n word is made specifically to make you feel that you're a black cat. Liked using it with your friends. Right. And even then it is like, you can use it however you want, but the designation of the word right is to make you feel, but that's what it's designed for. That's what it made up for. But I think black people have successfully taken a word that was negative and empowered. Sure. To the point where it's laughing fun. Absolutely good times and bad times. And you could use to describe a powerful person. Yeah. You'd use to describe an amazing artist. An amazing athlete. Yeah. Use it as a, yeah, it is the most fluid word. It's unbelievable. It's an incredible word in terms of like its ability to be used on in all, it's almost like the word fuck, right?

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       Like do you can stub your tone? Fuck. Or You could see a Ferrari go fuck yeah. Do you know in Brazilian it's the word com they use for that man. Why? Yeah, it's whole. Huh? Paul Ha. Okay. So like, you know, like someone will catch a guy in a choke and I go, Paul, hi. Like that's a good thing. Or You fuck up yourself, you're like, ah, Paul, hi. Yeah, my keys Spanish and say [inaudible], which means like mother bitch and it's like a good, it could be a good thing pulled Ahmad they deal. But that makes sense. Like mother, bitch, goddammit. But come doesn't even make any sense. Like I was trying to put my feeling of it. When you come it's like that is the sensation. Like that was so good watching you do that almost felt like me. Nothing. And it could be bad in that like you Dick Trick Gia and the fucking this girl he been trying to avoid and then you come and you'll be doing that is there's regret.

Speaker 4:          00:22:30       What I did everybody, but women will never understand post nuts syndrome a syndrome because this is something exclusive to us. Like I don't know. I like you until I come. That's true. Right? Yeah. Do not know it's, and that's why it's so fucked up. Like when you know women think we're fuck boys who were pieces of shit is dudes. It's like you don't get it. I think I like you. Right. Everything I'm saying to you, I believe in my deck is just saying, man, we're going to find out what we, let's see. And there are times where you not and it's like, Damn. Yeah, you realize you've made a mistake. Especially if the woman is really into you and you're really not into her and you're like, oh, I made an error and then you do feel like an asshole. Yeah. But if you say that to them, they're like, yeah, fucking asshole.

Speaker 4:          00:23:16       I'm like, I'm just being honest with you. I got tricked by genetics. Yeah. Why can't that be my biology? Why can't I feel so for women, you let me explain what this is like. Yeah, you have this, it's like finding out your guy was poor. This is what it's like. This is how I'd describe it. Having an erection and getting excited. It's like sitting in the backseat of a really long bus. Okay? And there's some other guy up there driving the bus. Most of the time you're driving the bus now when your Dick is hard, when you're dick is hard. There's some other guy driving the bus and all the windows are rolled

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       down. There's papers flying around the horns honking time and you look at it, life taking place through a dirty windshield a hundred feet away from you and you're like, do you even know where the fuck they're going past the stop and your Dick's like, just shut the fuck up and calm down. I got this. And then when you come, all of a sudden the fog parts and you're at the front of the bus holding the wheel and you're like, what? What am I doing here? How do they get here? Ah, and you look down at your Dick, you mother fucker, Bro. It's, it's being a werewolf. Yeah, it is being aware of,

Speaker 1:          00:24:19       right? Isn't that what, this is a metaphor for this ravenous creature. You're running around doing crazy shit and then you wake up in the morning naked. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       You're terrified. Covered in blood. Yeah. Well fuck. Sometimes. Sometimes God dammit. What did I do? What did I do? Well, I've got to turn myself in. Yeah, it's uh, it's terrible. But that's one of the reasons why, you know, it's so hilarious when you see someone who is a stereotypical male feminist cause you know they barely have enough testosterone to keep their heart beating and they probably don't get post nuts syndrome cause they just want everyone to love them. And they're in this weird state of, you know Benedict Arnold there being a gender traitor. I mean it's really what's going on. It's a lot of what it is. There are men that want women to be valued and see men. There's men that want women to have all the same, all the same opportunities and a quality and they want, they want to value them as human beings. And that's all real though. That is real. But there's way more sneaky week fucks that are pretending they think like this because they know that women go, good, good. You're on our side, you're an ally. Come over here, ally here in male ally. And there are always these like weasely little dude's with tiny hands and oh, even if they're big, they're like, they're awkward and they've had a hard time with women and so they just shit on these men who they feel they're in competition with. It's a complete hater mood.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       Absolutely. You've seen everything. You see it in comedy. It's like, oh, I can't do that type of comedy so I'm going to make that comedy radioactive. This is the only type of comedy that to loud. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Hey that comedy is so for example, like it doesn't have to be coffee. It could really be any kind of situation. It's like you're just trying to carve out the market share, right? You're like, Ooh, that Comey is dirty. That's edgy, that's sexist, bigoted sensor it sensor it. All that's saying is I don't want to compete with pussy with those guys. It's a little bit of that, but it's also like the same thing you see with the right versus the left. Like there's a lot of people online from each side. We want to censor the opinions of the other people. For sure.

Speaker 1:          00:26:32       Instead of having a better opinion, that's a punch. Shut that opinion off. Exactly. Yeah. So it's like, and when they don't have a better opinion, they just make you radioactive so they don't even have to talk to you, your races. Hey Joe Rogan, you're racist. You know, what do you mean? Let's talk about, and you're like, I don't talk to races. Ooh, that was clever what you did. You see what I'm saying? I went through that like the second I had an opinion that went against the grain immediately. I'm labeled as something that they don't even have to have a dialogue with. Right. They just shut you down. Well, oh, you're a white supremacist. Exactly. Oh, you're all right. Oh, you're this, you're that. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a simple week way to end a conversation, but all it does is it only works. It's like, it's like a magic trick.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       It only works if you don't know what they're trying to do. So how, what percentage of the population knows it? Right. That's, that's a question I've been trying to wrap my head around is like, like you and I can sit here and and see this all day, but I think most people are seeking confirmation, not information. Right? I most people like they start out their day going, I feel this way. It could be right, left central, it doesn't matter. And then they're seeking out information that confirms that. Right. You know what, there's a parallel to that with what we were talking about with standup comedy and your career. Because the reason why those people seek out confirmation rather than information, it's because they're insecure. They're not at a good place. But once you're in a good place, like everything feels good. Like say if you're in a good relationship and you know you have a good woman in your life and you're happy and everything's going well, then you see a lot of things for what they are versus if you're in the hunt, you're trying to get people to love you.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       You know what I mean? You don't have any exits. It's like, I mean this is a weird segue to it, but like I, I tried mom, I've never did a lot of drugs, but I tried Molly at Bernie man, right? And um, it was the first time that I experienced maybe outside of like comedy, but first time I experienced having like extra love. Yeah. Right? So instead of operating on a deficit and like trying to make you laugh, so I filled a void or like trying to say something interesting. So I fill the void, I had extra and what I did with the extra, without even realizing it is I called my closest friends and my parents and I just told them how special they were. Now, I didn't realize that until years later that that's what you do with excess. Right? So how do I get to excess without drugs?

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       Right? The question for me was also how do I find fulfillment in shit that is not in other people's hands so much? Like when we, when we were talking to the comedy store, like what I fucking love about the La scene right now is that comics have control of it, right? So it's like comics are pushing the comedy culture right now and it's because they're empowered. You guys have money, you guys have sustainability with your fans. You're not going, how am I going to get another pilot with comedy central? Am I going to get somebody to get here? Of course, when the industry ran it, comedy sucked. You guys were talking about fucking unicycles and Shit, right? And that's why, and that's why no, it's true. And, and, and, and look, we would come out from New York and we would come out and we'd be kind of disillusioned at the comedy scene back here. And maybe that was like some New York, west coast, east coast beef or whatever. And,

Speaker 4:          00:29:41       but what's funny is how to ecosystem always balances itself because as soft as comedy was out here, all the sudden an ad a nowhere does show called roast. Battle pops up is the hardest show to heart the artist show, bro. Like wild, insane. But here's a perfect example. Comedy central took that and they have watered it. Cut It like they would sell cocaine. Yeah. But you're not getting a pure no, you from Colombia. Not even remotely. They took all the juicy stuff out, the authenticity right up, but it was real for a minute. Can Go. They're still on Tuesday night and that place gets fucking while I get sad. What do you mean feel sad for some people that get toasted up there? I saw a joke. There was some kid who's not retarded, but what is it? A cerebral palsy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       And um, and, and he's up there with his palsy and the other guy goes, ah. He goes, he goes, you look like your arms drew your legs.

Speaker 4:          00:30:40       Oh, he's up there fucking shaking. Oh fuck. Oh my God. He said, he just puts your body in a blender. No, he looks like someone put your Voodoo doll and a blender. Oh my God. I was so ruthless. But that's what it needed to balance the system. Right. Well, it definitely helped. You know, there's a bunch of factors, but what roast battle is, first of all, there's, there's good things and bad things about, first of all, Brian Moses, the guy who hosted it was one of the nicest guys on the planet earth and that helps. And then also he says, you know, never gets physical end. We all hug like this, good in that course, you know? And then when people go after each other, like there's, there's a guilty pleasure to it that doesn't exist anymore. It's like there's a guilty pleasure to that kind of humor. It's very hard to get, if you're a fan of that kind of fucking vicious, awful comedy, it's very difficult to get anymore cause people don't roast each other anymore. They're afraid, they're afraid and they're soft like this.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       Like these kids are soft man and it's, we've got to stop blaming kids. We just got to start blaming parents. Like my parents were hard made, my mom's immigrant, maybe that's what it is, she Scottish. But like my parents were tough. Like my mom let me punch my brother in the face once because he like pulled my backpack or something. Like I remember like he like pull my back while I was like, mom, he pulled my backpack. Can I just punched him? She's like, once she just let me punch him. Right. And it was like for her when she grew up, that's what brothers did. And like people always do. You know, I know you have some guys come on the show and they talk about how like it's happening at the college level. Like we're entitling these kids and it's like, no, he's happening in elementary school is when these kids, what have my boy, Marco pointed this out to me. Both his parents are teachers in Rhode Island. He's like, what happens is these, these fucking kids complain about their teacher in school. Right. And when you and I were in school, our parents would go, well yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       sometimes you teach and are like you so figure it out. Yeah. And now these kids go, well mom dead. The teacher doesn't like people. Will that let's switch you out of this school. Let's switch you your teacher. Let's get your teacher fired. So they start thinking the world bends around them. Right. And then now to shit with the colleges, it's like I can't get into USC and say like, Oh don't worry. We'll figure out how to get you into USC. That fucking college thing is nuts, but we'll, we'll get to that. Yeah. I want to know what do you think is the root of the softness? Like what is the sheriff is why? What's the shit? I know exactly what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       You know when a power is taken, it's not given. It's taken. You have to take it. You have to rip it out of somebody's fucking hands. Power, right? Yup. And after you take power out of someone's hands, that's the last thing you take. It's give, right? If you have the right constitution, you have the right constitution for power. What have you done with your power? You've uplifted a comedy scene. You've, you do shows where your host him at the Improv, right? That's not for you, right? That's where comedy, okay. You're hosting shows that these different places you can sell out arenas. But you're choosing to do shows in the city, I'm assuming because you understand the value of giving. You're operating with excess

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       and but honestly the shows or for me to work out to work out, but you could do an hour. You don't have to put other comics on it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. You don't have to say Schultes can you come and do the show tonight? You know what I mean? Like at the Improv on Hollywood, which is sold out, sold out. I was about to try to help promote and I was like, does he need me to help this? But it's like so, so what happens is if you have the right constitution for power, you take and then you provide for your people, you give back. It certainly helps. It helps you too. People don't realize like how helping is addictive. Yeah. That's, we can get to that in a little bit, but like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:31       once you realize the value you get from giving, as long as it's the right person,

Speaker 1:          00:34:36       yeah. Then you just can't wait. Yeah. It's a trick and think that you should keep it all to yourself because when you keep it all yourself, you feel like shit, you're a piece of shit and you become that weird old miser that lives in the mansion on the top of the hill and no one could talk to him and you're miserable. Yeah. And you can go anywhere. No, it's a, and everybody looks at you like you're, that guy has got all that money. I've got to figure out how to get his money. And you want to be, you want to be Ali. Ali walks around in the neighborhood, he wants, he's dead. But when he did no security, now he can knock anybody out. But at the same time, if he just goes, hey guys, give me a second. I need a little, and he was older and he could barely walk.

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       He would just go everywhere. Anywhere you want. Love them because they recognize, man, we want to follow, but we want to follow the worthy. So we'll test worthiness. You know what I'm saying? So what happened? Why these kids are so soft is the king takes power. And then raises a bitch ass son because he never had to take shit. Right. And he doesn't want his son to go through what he went through. Right. He's like, you know how hard it was to take his power? I'm, I got one foot, you know what I mean? I lost a foot in a power struggle and that is, this sun is, everything's give it to them. It's like the spoiled print and every movie. You hate that fucking prince. So I think the generation that's raising kids right now, spoiled princes, the generation before that, Vietnam, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       Like being understood, sacrifice, war. They understood the investment in the country and then the generation that came next, which is handed shit, hey, everything's good. We're not, oh, we're not going to, whoa, wars just handled over there. I don't want to get drafted. And it's like, I almost think we should all be part of it, bro. It's like a regret of mine that I didn't do some sort of service because it's like how you complain at all about the country that you didn't put your life on life form. There's a lot of countries that have mandatory service. If they have extreme levels of patriotism and investment like South Korea for example, they took a uh, Don Young Kim on, was it a yeah, no. Who Was it?

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       Samsung Junge. That's who it was. The Korean Zombie. That's right. That's right. He took him out of his prime and he had to do two years of service in the Korean army. These Robinson basketball player had to do that navy time. Really? I just yo like you understand cause we're so detached and I don't hate on people for not realizing it because we are detached as what we do. Like little, you know, some child slaves make iPhone and you know, we were like, I just go, ah, you can only really be connected to what's in your world. Direct world. I'm cool. That's life. It is what it is. There's really no good or bad thing. She's are, you know what I mean? So it's like that's something we'll get to, but it is what it is right there. We're trying to do an ethical phone. Remember that phone?

Speaker 1:          00:37:16       What was that phone call? And again, there were, there were, there were putting together some ethical android phone man. Come on. Fairphone yeah, that it wasn't fair and nobody bought it. Fuck that shit was expensive. It's more expensive. They have a fair phone to pull that bitch up. Let's see what we got. Let's see if it could fuck with, so I'm trying to get off the apple tit. I told you I got this galaxy note. You come back row, you're going to come back bro. Beautiful. That screen is looking at this, but this shit is always freezing. The Pixel pixelated. True. That's not true. Come on Pat. This has a pen, a modular phone that's built to last. What does that mean?

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       But you can like attach it to it. Fondants they're built to last so you can, oh, that's gonna break. Definitely not waterproof. It says batteries. Those batteries replace the battery. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Remember when he used to be able to replace batteries? He's had hopped out the back of your phone. Samsung galaxy like seven or some shit. Removable battery. Android seven. This motherfucker's got android nine. You need to catch the fuck up. Naw, Bro. What else? Fair materials. Look, there's a white lady in the front. How fair. Three black guys who were working for what the fuck is fair about that picture? If you're going to go fair materials, how about you have white guys in their fifties working in a factory and not Chinese babies flush? Is this. We have to acknowledge though that like, do you know what I mean? Yo. I mean make it fair.

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       Make all these people, all these people who want to buy I iPhones and you want to have your iPhone built by some Asian slave. How bout you work for a year and upset the army you want to iPhone? Put the time in, but we should acknowledge that white women really kind of our superheroes in that way. White women. How so? Because it's like they're the only people who care about the environment. The only people who care about animals. Only people who build wells in Africa like they're really all my friend Justin wren builds wells in the Congo. He's a six foot three training. He said he's a Bella tour. Fucking top 10 heavyweight. Ask Him who's, who do people helping him? It's Rebecca. No, no, no, no. It's got a lot of women that you work for them. But a lot of men that worked for him too.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       This is weird. Like women, they fucking, they're getting it hard right now because I think their tire coming at white men, so they're looking for the next, you know when the grease boil and you got throw someone in it. But like when you won't talk about humanitarians, like who gets fucked by more races than white women. True. Like this is really true. True. Except who gets the short end of the stick there. Is that a penis size joke? No. Asian women and Asian men. Asian men probably fuck the smallest percentage of different races in America at least. I don't know how the rocket and 100%. Yeah. Yeah. They do the, yeah, I think they have like some like Tinder, they did something like Tinder study that showed that that has a weird thing. Yeah. Because to Asian women, no problem at all. But uh, other ethnicities, it's weird that it's not made to size.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       Right. How so? Like, like you would think that it's made to sat like Lego tiny women would be into a no, just like vagina would be like, you know, I don't know. I've never, I never thought that like Asian pussy was that much smaller than like studying, researching chemical evidence, you know? Well, you know, this doesn't make 100% sense. Okay. But I've met girls that were tiny that you could not fuck hard enough. Yeah. And it just opened up. Yeah. But not, not just that. It's just like they want it like that. They want, they want savage, they want to get fucking smashed. Why? Because I think they realized that they are tiny. They have small genes so they want to get savaged genetics inside them so they have survivor children. I really believe that. I think it only makes sense. Ah, some of the horniest girls irritated in my life weigh about 104 lbs. And these big brand that target chicks want it real soft,

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       no nice Beta male. They want to because they know that those are the little girls are fucking giant dudes making Doyle sites kid and they get to keep going. It's a never ending battle for genetics, dude. It really is fun. It's 100% it's a never ending battle of genetics. And if you deny girls fucking these like Beta dude's may not did they do it for a little while? They barely fuck them. They always say they have headaches. Listen, I know a lot of Beta dudes, dudes are headed. The girl does like, I can't sleep. They don't want to fuck the guys. Dude. I had a friend of mine who was dating a guy like that when she was a really like them. I just do not want to fuck him. And I was like, wow, cause why would you like that was rough. I'm like, what are you going to do? Don't fuck him, dude. It's it's dude, it's insane, man. It's like, I see this all the time, like these like hardcore perceivably, hardcore feminist chicks here. My comedy could be the opposite of that. And they're in the DMS, right? Saying, I don't know why I'm here.

Speaker 4:          00:42:39       I swear to God. No, it's a trap house. She could, because I think feminism in general is a direct result of a failure by men. To be fair and by a failure by men, to be actual men and to raise actual men who treat everybody with respect that when men are abusing women, those men are bullies. They're, they're weak men. The kind of man that would do that to a woman that would be like physically abused, a woman that's a weak man. That's the type of man that would eat up a smaller man or take someone from someone with four. Since security needs to feel powerful, he's a bitch. Yeah, he's a bitch. Right? The antidote for that is to be a strong man. Right? Like the, one of the things I've been telling people like this is how you fix bullying in school. Teach them how to fight, not the bullies.

Speaker 4:          00:43:32       I mean, not just the, not just the victims, but the bullies themselves. Everyone had a fight. When they feel confidence that they can defend themselves and it will have two nicest fucking people in the world. Martial artists go to martial arts gyms, go to a Jujitsu Gym, I'll take you there. All fucking nicest people hugging everybody in friendly. Then they're going to choke each other half to death and hell five minutes and before that they're all fun, happy, playful. They're so secure and outside of their, they're so secure and relaxed. There are different type type of person, obviously not all of them. Maybe there's people over the most part. Yeah, we vary wildly, right? But almost always to a human. The mean ones, whether it's mean women or mean wet mailman, weak women. Women will tell you this, that they work at an office and they've got a female boss.

Speaker 4:          00:44:21       That's a con. That is one of the worst fucking cause. You can't even fuck her. It was nothing. You can do. Nothing you could do to make that pitch happy. She wants to take from you. She wants to squeeze your blood it lease. If you're cute and you're boss is disgusting and he's a fucking asshole, you could flirt with them a little bit and you could like maybe get them to like you more. Don't do it. Obviously don't do that. But with a female boss, you have to have a person to shit. Shocking what the female boss, not even that lot of women don't like women. Right. One of the things that I love more than anything is when I talk to women and they'll do this thing where they look around to make sure no one's looking, no one's around. And I go, look, I would never say this publicly, but some bitches are fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:45:06       That's what we do with like racist shit. It didn't burn. Have that bit about like when I look around and then you slide the thing about these. Yes. Well this women feel like they've got momentum in this little war of ideas, right. With the me too movement and Bill Cosby getting arrested and r Kelly getting arrested and Harvey Weinstein. I, in my opinion, and I bet you think there's too, these are good things. Yeah. When shitty men get put away or they get arrested for abusing people, whether it's their physically abusing men or physically abusing women, it's always good. You shouldn't be physically abusing it. I'm out of here. Yeah, to beat those guys up. I mean this is handled in the community when we were younger, teenagers, a bottle of blood, you know, it was rough with this, the whatever who was rough. Right. And we went over there and if you were married and Harvey Weinstein tried to fuck your wife and she went in on an audition and you knew that there was all these solar, he guards and all these fucking levels before you got to him and your wife got into that level and he was treating her like shit and being mean to her and telling her if you want to work in this town, you've got to suck this little fat Dick be, it's over Harry.

Speaker 4:          00:46:16       That's over angry. I'm shocked. Like someone told it. Didn't Brad Pitt try to step to him or something like that? Did step to him and did he swing on him? I don't know what he did cause you got it. Right. Well that's the other thing is fucked up about this is like there's going to be Weinstein's. Yeah. Like these people are going to exist. This man, they still exist. Yeah, they still do it. Hearing about one last night, someone was to, I can't tell you cause I don't, he's a television personality who is apparently a closeted homosexual. Oh. And he's out there and he's out there like dude's yeah, just that home. I don't know. He's trying really hard and making them uncomfortable. Really? Really? How? How well known. I don't know. We'll talk later, but what I'm saying, go talk to him afterwards. Crazy fuckers out there. There's still rolling it old school. They want to get caught. Gwyneth Paltrow, V's Brad Pitt threatened to kill Harvey Weinstein. But you've got a swag on hand, but you got to swing on him, Bro. You gotta leave some marks? I believe it so well it depends on what Harvey did versus what if he grabbed her and did anything to her physically, then you got to swing on him. But if he just said something creepy and you tell, okay, then we have word

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       take your fucking life, I'll take your life. Well I think the issue with these things is like we know we're going to have Weinstein's but the people that protected Weinstein, like the second you complain about a guy for grope in or doing something crazy right, that woman is doing exactly what she's supposed to do, right? She experienced some, you know, sexual assault and she's telling right now if you silence her and shot her up, that's where the system falls apart. Right? So whoever is protecting him throughout, he got it. They got to go to right, because she did exactly what she was supposed to do. Right. There's going to be Weinstein's throughout life, unfortunately. A question. What about the support staff? All that many people, all of them are almost, they're not worse cause they're not doing it, but they're so bad because they stripped the person who was assaulted from like not only equality, but like they stripped her from, from life in a way like they made that person go, oh shit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       Life isn't fair and I don't have a shot. Do you know the expression diffusion of responsibility? It's, it comes when there's large groups of people that watch something, someone's going to step in. It's like that lady, uh, Jenna vcs or something. Remember that there was some woman who was getting raped in queens and she was screaming for like 40 minutes and there was all these neighbors around like, yeah, I heard it, but I thought Ted was on it. Oh Jesus, you didn't hear about this thing, Katie, Jenna vcs or some shit. It's an old story. But yet everybody was like, oh, I'll get it. It's the same kind of thing. It's like, well, it's just how corporations work. So if you're working for a corporation, the Corporation's dumping pollutants into the river, you know, you feel like, well, it's not my responsibility. I just work here in accounting.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       You know, like somebody else is going to handle this right now. This is, and I think when you, if you're working in like the Weinstein Company and you knew Harvey was out there slinging Dick First of all, and in their defense you probably didn't know the specifics, right? Because it's like, oh, Harvey's a dog. He's always out there trying to fuck. Yeah, that's sort of normal. Like a lot like people have to understand this. Why does a guy like that get rich? Why does it get rich as he likes some patron of the arts? Who loves creating Nabi? There's a little bit, maybe he likes power. If you like power, why do you like that power? What are you getting out of that power once you have a Ferrari, once you have a Mercedes, once you have a manager, what are you getting? You're getting pussy, pussy, pussy.

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       So not even about the post side. It's about power. It's about power so much in a shit. Like even these pedophiles, I don't even believe anybody's attracted to kids. Well, they definitely are. I don't believe it. I believe they're attracted to power and they're so wildly insecure that they need to be looked at like a god and children. When they look at you, somebody that they admire, something they truly look up to, etc. They can look at you in that. God likes state and so I don't think it's a physical thing. Like I was watching that abducted

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       in plain sight. He, he gets whacked off by the Dad. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       What? You didn't see this abducted in plain sight, bro. Oh my God. Well this guy, this, this pedophile destroys the whole family bro. He is to get to the daughter. He fucks the mom and dad who this is insane is Netflix. Yes. You've never, and they sent their comedy can imagine that. Imagine jumps, they don't censor comedy though. They don't need a damn censored mine, not you. You know what I'm saying there, but it's like,

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       and what were the bad guys essentially, but like my point is that is a crazy story. It's the dynamic of power. Like, like people say the Catholic Church makes these people pedophilia, pedophiles. No, they have that thirst for power and they're going, who in my community has that amazing power where they're looking at him as this godlike figure? Oh it was the priest at our Catholic church.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       That sounds like like like an evil choice. Let me give you an alternative perspective from psychologist cause a thing called imprinting that happens with young men in particular sexually. It happens with young women as well, but one of the things that can happen as young men can be sexually molested by other men when they're young and they developed this imprinting. The vast majority of people who are abusers were abused themselves. Right. And there's some horrible hijacking of the psychology of the person. When you're a six year old boy and some grown man has cock in your ass, there's, there's something about that that it fucks with their head, especially if it happens a lot and it becomes a part of your life and the guys nice to you as well and buys you things and does things for you and then you get older and you, for whatever reason, perpetrate this same har on other kids. This is something that happens. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       I think it's maybe, maybe it's a combination of both, right? Maybe you have that imprinting, right? And then it creates this massive void that you need filled. Like I think so much of everything that we do, everything that people do is about filling the void. And what is it that you need the void filled with dictates off. How often if you're evil, sometimes if you're good, there are some people that are addicted to working out, right? There's a void there they need to fill. Some people are addicted to eating. Those are the same addiction essentially. But one is a lot better to have than the other. You know, it's like even with, I mean there's even with Kanye, right? Like I see Kanye as like this guy who's just wildly insecure and he's trying to justify his coolness constantly by taking things that are not cool at all and making them cool within a community, within his community.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       Right? So it's like everything Kanye does like down to like, it started with like the wasp culture. I'm going to take like preppy, New England, you know, polos that are pink and shit and I'm to make that cool. Now before the hip hop community, I mean I grew up in New York, we were like, Yo, that's some gay shit bro. What the fuck is that now? Kanya where's it's like, Nah, you gotta look fly and this, these pink waspy things in my Khakis, whatever. Then he takes grunge culture, right? There's fuck, have you seen the bright that's ripped sweaters and all that kind of shit. That's Seattle Nirvana Shit. But he's like, Yo, I bet I'm so cool. I could make it cool. Right then it takes dad sneakers. I'm so cool. I could Yo, you think my community loves cool sneakers. I'm gonna make dad sneakers. Cool. And then what is the most uncool thing to his community? What Trump and what does he try to make? Cool. It's selfish is all about him. Oh, he cares is about proving that he's that dude and he takes the most uncool thing and puts it on his head and he's like, Yo, I'm going to make mega cool. And that's when people are like, at least his community was like, Nah, we're not gonna. We're not going to play with that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       You know what I think? I think uh, you know how like you have something that's supposed to take like eight volts. You have like a charger? Yeah, I supposed to take like when you go to Europe and you plug it in, right? Well like when you plug something into the wall like we have alternating current, like you could have something that takes way more amperage. Right. I think Kanye has the wrong plug to the universe and in a, in a good way without motherfuckers getting like a hundred volts all the time. So he wants to, do you ever talk to him? No. I talked to him on the phone and it was a stream of consciousness that was so intense. I was like, okay, now I get it. I kind of go, we had a long conversation. He's a very nice guy. We had a long conversation for like 1520 minutes on the phone, which is a long conversation these days on the phone.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Yeah. Blew the fuck talks on the phone anymore. He does. Yeah, but you're at your thing. He's getting a hundred volts bro. And he's got design going through his head and new song lyrics and new fashion and all this. And I think he's just catching whatever he can and holding onto it and waiting through the waves to fill though. But I don't know to fill, there's a little bit of that. But uh, with him it's almost like affirming that he's okay because he's so much different than everybody else. Like Elon Musk, like a lot of other people. Sure. What's up when he used the confederate flag, do you know about his statements on that? He, he said that like, he used this in a quote. What does he say? Oh, react to how you want any energy as good energy. That confederate flag represented slavery in a way.

Speaker 3:          00:55:52       That's my abstract take on what I know about it. Right. So I wrote the song new slaves still like the confederate flag and made it my flag. It's my flag. Now what are you going to do? Not what are you going to do? How can I take my equity and see if I'm so dope? But that's also his recognition that you can take something like the n word and use it as a positive. You could do anything. I mean, look, if, if black people really decide, I used to do this bit, okay, go. I used to as bit about a two member when

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       the fucking duck dynasty guy was, he was talking a lot of shit about gay people. It's like I don't understand it. I don't understand. And I was like, I don't understand yellow cars. He's a shit. If you understand why you wasting all your time but you better be nice because I go, if you keep fucking with gay people, they're going to do something and they're going to do something and you're not going to be able to take it back. Like what if gay people decided to take over Cammo and the bit was like, look what they did to the rainbow. I go fucking own the rainbow. I go, you can't wear a rainbow shirt anymore. Everybody like bath. They used to be leper cons and pots of gold. Now it's dudes. But fucking I go off to it, I have to do is start off every gay porn in a duck blind.

Speaker 4:          00:57:09       Two dudes Cammo dynasty and he get the gayest black guy in the world in camels. Like some about duck hunting make me haul. And some dude just drops in out of nowhere and pulls his camel to sucking his dick. If they just had all porno in camera, it's it, it would turn cam. I went to a gay thing and if black people just just went whole hog on the confederate flag, look at them. They got Cammo wallpaper, son. Absolutely. That's like some Annie Liebowitz shit though. That's like some vanity fair cover. Nonsense organized shoot. Very Meta. Those are weird. Or what they're doing though. These guys are smart. They are, by the way, that's a shit pattern. That's a bad cammo pattern. All ducks ducks. Maybe it's, there's, it might be their pattern. I bet it is a swamp. It's like, I dunno, the gay shit is like, you know, it's not the climate for it and I feel you. Oh, it could be. Don't between remember deliverance squeal like a pig. Yes. Yeah. But that was, that was rape. Yay. Came rape.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       It's not sex. It's about power. Well then they didn't do it right, but they also didn't get raped. I mean powers of part of it for sure. But they're just going to fuck you man. Fuck like this ain't sex bro. Just so we're clear, bro. That guy is fucking you. This is about sex and power. I get it. You're not gay, but it's still suck. People want it, man. That's the thing. I don't know. I think the Kanye thing, like he's just a guy who thinks way different. Like for whatever reasons, the connections. That's one of the reasons why I think this Kim Kardashian relationship works so well. Okay. There's cause like I bet she just handles normal regular stuff and he could just be Kanye. You know what I mean? Like it seems like they've disease people, different backgrounds, different, no deaf, different, different telling me cause it's me because the music is phenomenal outside of that.

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       Okay. It's real simple. Have you ever been locked up in a mental institute? No. He has. Yeah. They don't just lock you up bro. They never locked me up. Yeah. You know my, my wife never, I never came home. My wife has some fucking two gorillas that are in those lab suits that are staring at me. I'm like, what's with the big guys? Oh, these big guys are going to take you to a nice hospital. Like, sure, we'd like to handle this quietly. What the fuck? I'm not going with some hospital kicks Gel. Don't just go to the mentalist too, bro. They fucking, they velcro. You put the mental tissue doesn't mean that you are genius. There's a lot of crazy people who had just crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well he's definitely crazy, but he's also, but he's brilliant to see the work that comes out of that crazy is genius work.

Speaker 4:          01:00:01       Right. So what is it about him that allows him to be so prolific as an artist? You ever notice how prolific he is? Yes. You guys constantly, constantly banging out songs con and there there's, he doesn't have bad albums. No, he's, he is phenomenal at music without a doubt. Phenomenal. At music. This is all from this energy that's inside of him. He figures out how to channel that energy and put it in good ways, but occasionally, like it's not, it's easy. It's not a coincidence. It's not a coincidence that when Kanye was on stage, I think it was in San Jose and he said that he didn't vote, but if it was going to vote, he would have voted for Trump and the crowd went crazy and they booed the shit out of him and then he canceled his tour and then he went to demand mental health institute.

Speaker 4:          01:00:43       All that shit happened together because he felt the pain of this. Then his response to that was to double down. His response to that was to attribute qualities to Trump that he doesn't even really have and so Trump in his, in a lot of ways very wise, the way he handles things socially, he let Kanye coming to the White House where that Maggot hat and just ramped up a storm. Kanye could define who Trump was. He could define what loving Trump meant. You get defined why black people should, it should embrace Trump, right? He could define all this and his head to sort of justify what went wrong with him. Right. And then Trump just sits there and goes like this and let them talk and then he leaves. The Trump goes, what the fuck is phone calls? It is or it's a pizza Dick. Suck this shit right here.

Speaker 4:          01:01:32       That's it. This is now look at that white lady with her arms crossed in the background. Like what in the fuck I need to know. Or like what the fuck am I watching faith? The blood check right there in the center. Look at her face. She's like, okay. What that's her face says okay, what Kanye is like showing Donald Trump his phone to cut. Donald Trump's got his lips pursed June phone. Cushner show me some lyrics like a devious smile and coasters phase. Where dude up that dude. How about the black dude sitting there like I can't believe I have to just face. He's like, what in the fuck do I do when I get fired from here? Cause I know it's coming. I know it's coming. Oh it glad about the dude in the back of the beard who get the brother in the back. He's like, man, you gotta be fucking Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:02:25       Me, Ryan Gosling with the boom mic. Oh look at that guy. Yes. Manga all the way. He's like, Yay. I can't wait to get on Gab and talk about this amazing meeting of the minds to look at his face. Who Trump reached out to? You know, I'm friends with his son though. Like text friends. Really? Yeah, he's a nice guy. He's a hunter. We know each other through mutual friends and one of our mutual friends who committed suicide. Oh Shit. So I was like, no, but he's a nice guy. I mean, I don't agree with a lot of things that a lot of people that I know agree with. Yeah. I think, I think we're allowed to be reasonable and cordial with each other. Yes. What's the matter? What are you laughing at? What is it? Jim Brown was also sitting at that luncheon. Let him let him know.

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       Jim Brown used to do the early commentary for the UFC. Really? Yeah, man. He used to wear one of them Africa hats. They're just like traditional African. Yeah. He was like, he did my job for the UFC. Like UFC like one and two. Are you see MMA savvy now? He's just a dude who knows how to fuck people up. That's true. He's Tim Brown man. Look at him now. The guy on his left, uh, are left too. I left his bill. Super Foot Wallace. That's a world champion. Kickboxer from the 80s. He's a legend in the kickboxing world. There is Jim Brown. I just started, uh, taking a couple of kickboxing classes, kind of learn. You've got to get framed for it. I used to box, right. So it's like the most hum. First of all, it's nice to have something to like, want to get better at. That has nothing to do with career.

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       That's really fun and you know, but uh, the, the interesting thing about the kicking aspect of it is, uh, when I, when I would see guys learning how to box, like the hook is a tough punt for people to get right. Because it's something you almost have to kind of like pop, write it and people try to throw it instead of let your body throw it. And that's who I am with kicks. I feel the like the exact same person I've been trying to teach how to throw. It's just my body doesn't want to let the legs go. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure whipping, you know, uh, I can help you. Yeah. I used to teach re. Yeah, I see that you do a lot and I could definitely help you with that. Yeah. You know what to think the way to do it is you do it slow, right?

Speaker 4:          01:04:44       Yeah. You do it slow and you don't try to hit anything hard. When you try to hit things hard, then you tense up and you like fucking Herky Jerky and goofy and key to learning how to kick ass to do it slow. Slow. It's a big part of it. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh, you don't try to smash, you just try to like get your torque. Right, right, right. Make sure you're pivoting off your bottom foot, you know, the support foot as to pivot almost with every kick basically. Yeah. Every kick your support, foot pivots, support one is the one that I'm just wondering, standing on one, your stay. Yeah. That standing foot has to constantly pivot. It has to go. You asked to be, you have to be planted. Right. But you also have to be able to move with it. It's like a coordinated dance.

Speaker 4:          01:05:26       That's why at timing and kicks is so difficult because you got to, you got to time it and then you got to twist your body and at the same time, but everything's got to work in coordination. It's got to work in concert. It's such a cool, I think kickbox has gotta be the worst marketed sport and the world. No, that's what I said. It's the greatest sports to me. It's like for standout fighting. Yeah. It's the best one. There's a company called glory and I've been trying to Japanese one. No, no, no. They were American or I'm sorry, from the Netherlands. From Holland. Um, find out where they're from, but they're international. They do a lot of events here in America. Right. But they're on UFC fight pass and I think they're on ESPN two what headquarters are in Singapore? Singapore. Oh, that's interesting. That's new.

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       They might've got bought out. Couldn't move there too. Okay. So we're trying to do some of the best fucking fights you'll ever watch in your life. I watched it. I have a, in my studio, in my gym, I have apple TV and I'll watch 'em glory on, it's like an app on UFC fight pass and I'll watch it and some fucking amazing fights because people don't know because Dana white has a really good point. In the 1980s with that bill super foot walls guy was fighting. He was actually, before that, he was in the late the seventies into the 80s there was a thing called Pka karate and it was on ESPN and it was terrible. And it was a kickboxers who are basically like not the best kickers and not the best boxers. And then it was like kind of goofy and clunky. There's a few guys like Rick, the Jet Rufus and some really popular guys who were really good that we're also doing it at the same time, but for the most part it was just terrible to watch.

Speaker 4:          01:07:09       It was boring as fuck. And then you'd watch boxing. It's he Mike Tyson at the same time. So Mike Tyson's on TV, Marvin Hagler is on TV and you watch these guys and these guys are like add a shape and then so it tainted the, well a little bit you're saying? Yeah, a lot. Yeah. It's and Moitai for whatever reason. I mean you go to Moitai events and uh, they're rabid and it's like a very deep community of people that really understand and appreciate the sport. They'll play the Thai music and the world of Mong Kong on their head, they bowed or their trainer by seven rolling elbows and smashing again legs. And it's amazing to watch. Same thing. Is kickboxing more or less moist? The hardest. It's the hardest of all of them. More elite version of kickbox that because it's elbows and knees and a lot of clinch work and a lot of dumping where they trip you and slammed me to the ground and, and they kick you on the way down to they'll, they'll, they'll throw you into the ropes and if you're still on your way down, you get punted in the head.

Speaker 4:          01:08:09       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and it's legal. It's a hoard sport, man. It's just part as it comes. You feel like we could get people to get behind. I mean even from you yet you'd have to have some sort of an epic change in the way we view things. But to me it's way more exciting than football. Like if those football players all decided to do Moitai, it would be better for their brains. Right? Believe it or not, to be a fighter. And two, you would see these elite athletes fucking smashing each others. Let's talk about the incredible, I want to talk about, because I was talking to Brendan about this and then a and Izzy, uh, is he came on one of my podcasts. Um, and we were talking about when, when are the elites, Izzy, uh, out of Sonia. Oh Yay. Yay. Style bender.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       Yeah. Style or [inaudible] style. Then my guy, man, I love him. He's the, he's like east, he's a perfect example of, of the style that is so fucking exciting to watch. Shows his opponent. He's fighting this dude that's the Loom Kelvin Gastelum who is one of the elite of the elite out there as well. Strike Wrestler, Short, stocky blasting, striker, good recipes. Whistleblowing these fucking wrestlers in the world. They're tough as fuck. But they have power. It's, it's a unique thing because sometimes the Jujitsu guys don't have power with the hands. When these wrestlers, it seems like they all have power and I was asking us and folks around in there like it's core everything. Yeah, some of them but like Ben ask who is probably one of the best wrestlers in the sport doesn't have any power in that sense. Cause even try. Yeah, but he's just about getting you to the ground fucking you up.

Speaker 4:          01:09:50       He just has such unbelievable confidence and he should, he's undefeated in his wrestling that he just concentrates on, absorbing whenever he can and grabbing, what is his w I mean like maybe I'm just such a, you know, a Newbie to this, but like I don't understand his, his leverage point. Like what his, his skill, his, his, his. He's so strong that his, is it his grip? Like what, what is he doing? Physical strength. It's technique. It's an understanding of it. You, you to think of wrestling the same way you would think of chess. Like if you only know a few moves, you're not going to beat a guy who knows all the moves. He knows all the moves. So once he's locked with you, defend, you think, oh, I'm going to stuff, I'm going to dig in my hooks. I'm going to palm Mullander here and I'm going to defend here.

Speaker 4:          01:10:40       He knows you're going to do that. So He's, he's shooting, waiting for you to Palmer as you're palming, he's switching to the inside. He's tripping you. He's grabbing hold of your legs and it's really awkward way he's rolling back because he knows your weight is going to be going in a certain direction. He's anticipating several steps ahead and he has international wrestling competition experience, which is just next level. He's wrestling these guys from Russia and Iran and some of the best wrestlers in the world. He, there's levels to this fucking thing and level Aa, his levels,

Speaker 3:          01:11:15       but the same you could say about style bender. See the thing about style bender is he's an elite kickboxer. He lost the glory middleweight title and a very controversial decision to Jason Wellness, who was one of the elite of the elite, one of the best guys out there. So style bender competed at the highest level of one of the most difficult combat sports in the world and in that world he's known as a precision artist, right? That world. He's a technician. He's not like, there's some guys that are just thugs. They got a good low kick, they get a good shell, they throw bombs that will in a bra. They know a few things. They know how to pump the Double Jab and lead and to get that inside leg kick in style benders a different animal. He's switching stances on you. He's hitting you with upward elbows, setting things up.

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       I notice him with the faints. Yeah, he fucks people up. There's a video of him. The one when he went into God mode that I had on my Instagram that Lawrence Kenshoo broke down. Dude. He fucks people up, man. Yeah, yeah. And he fucks people up in an artistic way to the way he picks his shots. He just knows what you're going to do before you know what you're going to do. And he has several steps. So he has that same level of skill that Ben Astron possesses in wrestling. He hasn't kickbox. What is more valuable on in an openness is like right here, like you standing in front of this dude, she's setting them up, looking for the moves with witness, see how the guy responds, and then hit watch this Sam Senate and then walks away. The walkaway Kao one of the most devastating slash psychological maneuvers of all time.

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       He's a special guy, but there's no one thing that's better. That's the most effective form wrestling because of the best wrestler can dictate where the fight takes place. The best wrestler can get ahold of a guy and dragged him down like Khabib, Norma Madoff, who might be the best fighter in the world. He's the UFC lightweight champion. What stands out about him is that he can get ahold of the guys and once he does, they can't do Jack Shit about it. He's not the best striker in the world, but he's good enough. So you have to be scared of him on the feet. Cause he dropped Conor McGregor. I mean he's, he can tag you, he can fuck you up. He's got powers, knock guys out. But more importantly that's to set up the clench and then once he gets to the clinch, your, his, that's it. Then you go on far ride, you're getting slammed and then you're getting the fuck beaten out of you on the ground and you're getting strangled. And that's just how it goes. But he has, he has the full skill package, like he can strike with you. He can submit you, but his grappling is what allows that to take place now with style bender style benders grappling allows him to stay up on the feet. See, he's a very good grappler in terms of his ability to get back up and his ability to stuff to take. He's got the sprawl. Yeah. Not just sprawl, but he gets the fuck out of there. He pushes your head right. He pops his legs out

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       and kicks back and then he punishes you on the way out. Take that with you. Great distance. It's a different, I noticed it's different like with the sports and involve legs, but like you guys fight at a, at a, at a further distance course. Yeah. Yeah. But it also makes you susceptible for counters in a way. Like, like when, when Connor was fighting Floyd, my biggest concern for Connor was not speed or counterpunching. It was the distance that you're going to be able to counter. And when, when Connor caught Floyd Floyd a couple times in the beginning, I think one was the left upper cut he called flood. That was shocking to me because I was surprised that he had boxing counter punching speed. The distance is half. Yeah. Compared to a Kingsport. Yeah. I would say if we're standing what, two, three feet away from each other in kickboxing, it's one and a half boxing.

Speaker 4:          01:15:08       So to cut that distance in half and still have the counterpunching ability was impressive. Yeah. I mean, well he's done a lot of lower level boxing and the gym stuff like that is when you get up to that level, it's a different fucking game. Floyd Mayweather is on a completely different planet than anybody else. He's the greatest great of all time. That's what I meaning like, I think he's better at boxing then Stephen Hawking is at astrophysics. Ha, you might be right. Look, he's 50 know the con. It does count even though probably shouldn't, right? I mean it was a real boxing match, but it was a guy that had zero professional boxing matches. Uh, but he did get tagged Connor, Ken Punch. He's a good fighter. He's a very good mixed martial arts fighter. But the thing about Floyd is that Floyd is the best at not getting hit.

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       No one's better. So I've been tagged, really tagged like three times, four times in his whole career. I can name five times. It should be Shane Mosley, my Donna the end of the fourth round. Yup. Um, the other ones are early. I'm Judah, right. Hook actually dropped him. Sam shooter was a wicked man. It was great. His Dad was a kickbox. Yeah, that's right. He came from that. A you uh, what does the name something something, dude, I forget his name, but all guys, y'all do y'all do it? Yeah. And then, uh, to Marcus Chop Chop quarterly. Oh, that's right. I forgot in them. Oh yeah, that's right. It was, um, yeah, my, my pops is like a massive box and Fannie, we still like go to Ollie's a, he was a journalist back in the day, used to cover like Ali and his fights and so like, that's why I kind of came up, you know, generationally watching boxing.

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       So that's awesome. Yeah, dude, it was like, I mean some of the best moments, you know what else Floyd has going for him, that the best Jujitsu guys have going for him is that he's not physically powerful. Like the best Jujitsu guys are smaller people because the smaller people learn how to use leverage and technique and the camp muscle things. Whereas if you look a 250 pound gorilla, you're some good old football player dude. And you're like, man, I don't want words fuck Jujitsu. Like you don't ever have to be on your back. Right. You know, like I was talking to shab about Daca shops, thinking about doing Jujitsu again, cause I was telling him I got a back end to a recently. I'm really enjoying it and like, ah, I don't know. I

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       go, just roll off your back man. Tell him to be a big guy with a guard. No big guys have gone. It's so rare, right? Because big guys just get little guys on the ground and they have a nasty top game. But then when they find themselves on their back, a lot of them are turtles. Ooh, they don't know what to do. It's a technique thing. A little guy has to learn perfect precision technique because they don't have that extra size point guard in the NBA. Floyd has we cans, he's broken his hands many times and even though he's capable of knocking guys out, it's with precision. [inaudible] going to knock you out like a John the beast Mugabi would or a Francis and Ghana would or a fucking a real power puncher. Joe Smith. There's guys who just fucking get you to the cage or against the ropes had just smash.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       Yeah, uncanny. Some of these guys, it's just raw. Power's empty and it's, Yep, he, Floyd is all precision and he's all like, one of the most fun things for me is watching Floyd in the first round and watching him take away your life. Like I like to see him take away a fighter's confidence. Right? Like he knew that Moseley was going to get off with the jab, or at least he knew, mostly thought that he was going to get off with the jab. And there's a moment, even in the first round, I know he gets tagged with that overhand right, but there's a moment where Mosley, Mosley pops the Left Jab and Floyd sees it steps back slightly and then come straight over at the right. In that moment, you could see Shane know that there's nothing he can do because Floyd has time the Jab and countered it directly.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       So now your job is done. Right now I've locked off one of your arms. I've literally just cut it off. Now you've got to open up with the right. You're not going to do anything to me. Just straight, right. I mean, I got the Philly shell. It's over. It's like seeing him take pieces away from a fighter. I just, I love fucking Floyd man. Well, he learned how to apologize the age too, and his dad was a wizard. His Dad when he was young, fought sugar ray Leonard and of course good fight when sugar was in his prime. Good pedigree. Men got some good pedigree. They know how to do it. This smart fighters goals. Roger Mayweather, Black Mamba. His brother was a motherfucker man. I used to love watching his brother fight back in the or is a, is a uncle rather. I used to love watches, uncle fight.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       He would fight on like ABC, like whatever television shows were having boxing on television during the day. Maybe it was ABC, I don't remember. But yeah, he was like that family. He grew up boxing and he also got to see the things that people do wrong, you know? And here's another thing that Floyd has going for him. Conditioning on the unfathomed. He's always in tremendous shape. Always just always in shape. I think it's a hustle. When you see a meeting, the mcdonalds and shit, nothing saw that. You think regularly? 100% yeah, you can eat that shit. It's just carbohydrates. It's just bullshit. The thing about that, like either eating sugar, like

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       he'll drink a soda after a workout. He's working out for two and a half hours and you can take some sugar, dude. Not only can you take some shit, there is an argument that that kind of sugar is not bad for you after you have a brutal workout. Dude, when I was, when we did this sober October challenge, man, dude already looked phenomenal. Fucking funny. So I'm in New York. I was like, Dude, you had ads are who was going to be my biggest competition too. Cause he lists them on hired in his face. Like his head is just exhausted. Yeah. He's like er, yeah. So door to this bullshit. But his body was fucking shredded. Shredded. Yeah. What is this head? Johnson. He always eats McDonald's. He's doing while he's working out right here. Yeah. Yeah Dude, you can do that. Yeah. It's all in how much you exercise with them now that's not surely eat, go chat.

Speaker 4:          01:20:53       Obviously he's eating healthy food on top of that. But if he feels like fucking off and getting a big Mac, he could do that. And there's no, no performance benefit, right? No, but no penalty. You can do it. So when Floyd does that, he is doing that. Yeah. It really is eating that nuts. It's Chad still working out. Yeah, he does. Just for exercise, just for fun. He fucking loves it. 22 miles an hour. It's his comedy. What does he do with this these days? So what he'll do is he'll like play guys and like play guys in FIFA online. He's a great follow on Twitter. It's hilarious. Oh yeah. I follow. It's like hit like a girl. We'll post a picture and then he'll say, what's wrong with the picture? It, she'll be smoking high and be like, yeah, but your shades at $30.

Speaker 4:          01:21:34       Like, you know, don't put so much money into your outfit when the blinds in your house or $30. Like he'll just nit pick little things like, dude, he's hilarious. But his, um, my guesstimation is, um, this is his comedy, like remember you saying? Yeah. Yeah. He used to sleep at the arena or at least at, at the stadium. He, when he played, he was obsessed with it. He loved the sport. He was talking about fighting Anderson Silva at one time. No, no, no. He's crazy. He's talking about finance, football player, coffee Anderson when he was in his prime. I think he has martial arts skill though. I'm not bullshitting. I saw South Pole is actually he's got fined him hitting the pads are hitting the bag cause I think he has real martial arts skill like legit martial arts. But that's the question. It's like when are these elite athletes going to enter MMA?

Speaker 4:          01:22:25       Damn. Well they are but in small, who's the small numbers? Well Jon Jones is absolutely an elite athlete but he's got a 20 inch vertical. Uh Yeah. How elite he did. He's got small calves but the fact that he has those small cows allows him to be six foot four and 205 pounds. Right. You're saying if he was bottom heavy he'd be to 50 he'd be a different weight, which she could be, but the way he could be a heavyweight, he could bulk up and go up to heavyweight, but he's got like weird calf genetics is calves are tiny. Right. The thing is you don't have to jump that much in MMA and he can hit you in the face with a flying knee. But the what he

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       knows how to do and what he can do physically in terms of his wrestling and his ability to close the distance and smash guys time people. He's an elite athlete. I think he could, he could have done that. His, his two brothers play NFL here he is sparring a little bit. He's in blue, right? Yeah. Still can't be touched. He says, well he's a southpaw so let's see this from Anderson Silva, so he's full. Okay. Oh it's good. Good habits. Good head movement. Yeah, for sure. I like the way it moves hands down over ridiculous. See cause the duty sparring though, we don't know shit about him. That guy might be terrible, you know? I mean the guy didn't want to try to go to the body, he didn't duck in and when someone's moving their head around like that just smashed the ribs. You go right after this gloss of the arms.

Speaker 3:          01:24:02       Yeah. Hit those arms. So they tried to do with Floyd, man. Yeah. Good luck, good luck. Flaws in the game that no flaws. The flaws. One thing, it's like we're talking about with Ben Aspirin that when a guy's a super elite wrestler, you think you're going to do something but he knows you think you're going to do something. So he does it. You do what you were going to do, he anticipates what you're going to do. He has an answer to that and then you have to regroup and he's already moving on to step three. It's just too many steps that he's ahead of you. Can there be a guy like with him that you don't engage on the ground? Like you just kind of Jab, stay on the outside?

Speaker 3:          01:24:37       Yeah, for sure. Look, Robbie Lawler, uh, almost took Ben Aspirin out in his last fight and it was Ben's mental toughness and his ability to endure punishment. Most guys would have probably gone unconscious there. Yeah. But style bender, like a garlic style bender would be one of the worst fucking nightmares for a guy like Ben ask him. Cause he's super difficult to take down and on the feet. He's not going to do anything stupid. Right. You're going to move forward and try to grab a hold of thing and you're just gonna eat knuckle sandwich after knuckle sandwich and he's gonna slowly chop at your legs walk. Yeah. And you're going to feel that low calf kick and whack. You're going to feel that inside of your thigh. Shit. You going to try to walk off the pain, you'll switch stances cause it starts to hurt whack. He didn't recognize you switching stances.

Speaker 3:          01:25:19       He attacks the other leg. Now both your legs are fucked up. Yeah, he comes down the middle with a need of the solar plexus. Now you're hurt. Try to play it off. It's just a matter of doing his game in his instyle benders game. His game is keep the fight standing. Fuck you up. And then Ben aspirins, it's grab a hold of you. Fuck you up. Drag it to the ground. Fuck you up. It's a matter of like who, who's better at the weak aspect of the other person's game, right? Yeah. Yeah. How can I take advantage? Crazy and no one could be the best at everything. So some like MMA. Math is a notoriously difficult thing to do. Like say say if, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       if Jamie beats me, but I beat you, but you beat Jamie. Yeah. Like that happened. But that's what, that's Emma May math. It's crazy. Always say that with like, you know, styles make fights. Yeah. But it doesn't work with Floyd. See Him boxing that styles make fights only go so far. With MMA it's, it's because the sports more comprehensive because there's more skills, there's more different things happen in football compare to basketball. Maybe there's more, there's more tools that can be used in here that can offset what's going on. Yeah. Basketball, the warriors are going to beat any team four to seven games. It that's just going to happen. I don't know shit about basketball or football, so I'm just guessing. You could be a superstar. Like there's no one position in football that can change the game. There's no, I think a quarterback's over rated and to be honest with four, I think the most important positions is offensive.

Speaker 5:          01:26:58       Defensive Line. Well, I'm always amazed at Tom Brady's body, how regular it is. Super, super reg, super regular, but they get it. That whole, that team gets it. They like, like I think Tom Praise like 15th highest paid quarterback in the league. It's like, right. But if you look at elite athletes body, right, I want to see a dude is built like Camacho Huseman. Yes. The UFC welterweight champion. Yeah. That's an elite. You look at them and go, oh, he's not an elite athlete. Looks like a UFC champion. He's not only that. When you hit well, greatest quarterback of all time, whoa. Can't wait to see this guy without a shirt on. Like your father.

Speaker 5:          01:27:37       You know what he looks like a Tom Tom Brady. Tom Brady looks like. Yeah. I mean, what makes that guy so special? Things like sometimes you know something's going on. Yeah. He's up here and I think, you know, he's got a lot of it up here and he works hard. It's like, you know, sometimes the greatest aren't that great picture of him next to [inaudible]. You know, you know what it is. It's like sometimes having all the natural tools is a, to your detriment is looking at that. Yeah, Bro. Come on. Sample. Yeah, like a leopard. Yeah, he's ready. Yeah. Ben aspirins similar to, yeah, he's got a little muffins. He's got a little muffled on a Ben aspirins. Got even worse. Pull up a picture of Sam down in wait Ben Aspirin cause he doesn't want to and he's got it like that. I don't give a fuck. He's, he feels like he's so much better as a wrestler that everybody else is fucked. Gimme give me an image. Yeah, go to his abdomen looking at that. I mean, he's got the ABS, he's got Leslie underneath that. Uh, that's from one FC. He looks even worse now. Yet. Winning. Yeah, there he goes. I mean that is not, that's Tom Brady, man. The ideal male combat body. You would think that's not what the ideal body looks

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       like, but he'll fuck shit up. Yeah. This is a picture of him with Kamara Huseman there, but he's got a shirt on. Yeah. Ooh, Swan is insane. Lucky for him. But like this is just some guys that like, okay, Francis and Ghana is a perfect example. Some guys look like a destroyer. They just look like a destroyer. In Ghana it was like six, five, 200, maybe more than six. Like I think you were saying earlier about the, about the uh, Jujitsu, right? Like, and it's not just in, in this, it's an anything. It's like sometimes the guys with all the natural ability, they don't have the, the work ethic to be the greatest because it comes so easy. You know? It's like, like we, we all know comics that are like so funny hanging out and they're okay on stage and it's, I think it's be, as comedy comes so easy to them, they don't hit the gym.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       You know what I mean? Like maybe you need that like Jordan, almost like sociopathic approach to it. You know, we're like, like we were having this conversation earlier is like, like, do you think Jordan's happy? I don't think he's happy. I remember when he was inducted, abducted, abducted, inducted into the hall of fame. I think it had to tell him he was in an abducted, in plain sight. And I was like, well, if this guy fuck Jordan to the goat, do you remember when he was inducted into the hall of fame and he was talking about writers, he's talking shit about writers. Fuck yeah. He wasn't thanking his coaches and his teammates and it's been an amazing ride and I feel so blessed and fortunate. No, he's still like, fuck you. Remember when you said that? Fuck you [inaudible] 93 your sports illustrated issue. You said buy shoes look shitty.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       Well he has his furnace race. Some people have, some people need that as a furnace. Like they need that, that competitive drive, you know? And like, I feel like, I feel like that happens when you don't derive joy from what you do. You know, like you derive joy from that outcome. You're, you're obsessed with outcome. You know, like at least for me, everything before was outcome, right? It was like, I'm good if, if I get a special, I'm good if I'm doing these things or I'm good if I kill. And the second I was stripped of the opportunity to do those things. I actually found like I loved creating more and then whatever the outcome was was extra. Does that make sense? I think it's a happier path. I think so too, but I don't know if it's the path to greatness as much as the path of the psychopath, especially when it comes to competitive sport percent.

Speaker 1:          01:31:47       Something about the best athletes. They all miserable. How they, they have a fucking self-loathing. They and they also have an ego and they have this, this anger towards the competition. Yeah, like if you beat them, they would say that if you beat Jordan and it came pool fucking hate you for training again. Yeah, but he needs it. He operates on, I'm not good enough and if I beat you then he goes, all right, I was good enough. I don't even know if it's that he thinks he's not good enough is that he knows he can get you don't quit motherfucker. I'm going to get you, but why does he need to get you? I Dunno. He needs to because it's like he needs to confirm something maybe. Right. I need to confirm. It's constant confirmation. I need to confirm. Confirm that Greg confirmed. Confirm where it's not that he doesn't believe he's great. It's that he wants to confirm it constantly. It's a little shadow of a doubt. Yeah, I'm great. I'm great. He's walking around, I'm great, and there's a little voice in his head is going, hey, you might not be that great. How about when he played baseball? That motherfucker want to prove you're the hardest thing to sports. Hitting a baseball. It's the hardest fucking thing. And he just jumped from basketball to baseball and was people act like he was trash. He wasn't even that bad. He hit like two 50

Speaker 1:          01:33:04       no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not a baseball card. I'm looking at. Says he was three Oh two that maybe what it might be for. That's for none on one 85 out of six 15 at bats. We're talking about the heart.

Speaker 2:          01:33:15       This thing in sports is hitting a fucking base. The fact that he, I mean there's a bunch of rumors and why he even went into baseball in the first place. But like that's, it's that cycles and Campbelltown, right. That's something we'll say is gambling. Some people say, you know, there's, there's a bunch of different things. I don't want to, you know, put it out there cause I don't know. But like it's one of those, I think there is a balance man. I think that you could, I think if you truly love what you do, like if you love the creative aspect and then you have high standards for yourself, then you can achieve both. Yeah. I think that achieving quote unquote greatness, um, and living with misery, I don't think that's worth it. No, I don't think that's where the, for you, it's like you got one shot at this man, like this, this life man.

Speaker 2:          01:34:04       Like you got one shot at it, try to figure it the fuck out. And it takes time to figure the fuck out. But it's one of those things you can't even really explain to people. But if you can, I'm approaching this point in my life where like, yeah, I think I, I get it. Does that make sense? Like how old are you now? 35 yeah. And then like, it's like my, my buddy explains it like this. He's like, there's these different phases in life. He's like, there's, and none of them is better or worse than the other, but you know, there's this vegetable phase. We were like, just going to work and then coming home. Right. And, uh, you don't think about anything. Then there's a why phase, right? Which is what gets us into comedy. A lot of us, right? We started asking him why she supposed to do with shit. Like why do I have to have breakfast in the morning or like whatever it is. We just, why. And then there's the phase, which a lot of the discussion is on, on this show and a lot of comedy operates is, which is everything is and isn't, not everything is or isn't.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Right, right, right. It's like what, where you operate and why people are drawn to this. Right. And why people are drawn to, maybe my stand up in other things is we're shaking the foundation of the world. We're showing that the world isn't one way. You're not either good or bad. Everybody and everything is both. The maggot had is so offensive to women, right? Cause it stands for these offensive things. It's like, well what about the Viking helmet? Like they did some fucked up shit to women didn't today. Right? We wear that every Sunday for Vikings Games, then people will, all right, so two things can be true or two things can be false, you know, and like that, that place where like fucking comedy, Liz works nuance where comedy lives in a conversation lives, you know, that is an amazing place. They not everybody gets to. Well that's what's so offensive about progressive fake comedy is that they're pretending the world's binaries.

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       It's one zero and you have to punch up. All comedy is punching up. I had a conversation with this guy, wrote a book once. There's no gray, there's no gray. It's black or white. So without gray, they don't even believe there's great like you. And I take for granted that we understand there's gray, we truly understand it, we truly get it and that's why we can have a conversation about maybe some of the most vile things and try to put context into it or nuance as you were saying. You know what I'm saying? That conversation, tons of people are going to write comments on are you motherfuckers are this and then the other side is going to go. You might've fuckers are that. It's so problematic that you're talking about guest, so why? Why can we do that? What makes us able to do that?

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       What do we understand about the world that allows us to do that and how do we, you can't tell people things. You have to show them. How can we show that humor? I think that's it. I think that's, I think that's why we're the first persons killed when a dictatorship takes over the comedians. Yeah. The philosophers, comedians, like anybody who goes, hey, look at the world this way. Like get them the fuck out of here. Stop Mocking Shit. Stop making people think a little bit. Well, also, the thing about comedy is I've always said that if you can make someone laugh about something, you forced them to think about it. If you're just onstage spouting your opinions, like one of the real problems that I have with a lot of what they're calling comedy, where they're just waiting for applause breaks and you say something, Bro clapped her intersectional, you know, ideas must be approached with the same, they're abusing condo. Where you're doing that they're doing is they're doing, is there a time where they can do whatever the fuck they want with it? But I know the difference. It's, it's a, it's a hack. They've like, they figured out a way to like make a shortcut, but it's not stand up. It's something else. It's like you just expressing opinions. But if you just onstage saying your opinions on things, I can be in the audience. Go on

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       Ma. I don't agree with that. I have a different opinion. But if you're on stage saying something that makes me laugh, even though I don't agree with your philosophy, bull fighting. Ah, that's, that's when it gets you, like if you're a hardcore republican Trump supporter and someone does a joke about Trump that makes you fucking laugh. You're like, God dammit, he got me. This motherfucker got

Speaker 2:          01:38:17       game the second you told me. I can't joke around about some of this. That's what I want to joke around about. Now you just gave me the bull and there's this thing in bullfighting where if you put a little bull out there, the crowd boos. Oh right. Because they want a dangerous book. Fair. Trousseau and that's how comics feel when we see you do an easy joke. We don't, we don't say it out loud, but in our head we're like, yes, they're all going to laugh at a joke about how women are smarter than men because there's a bunch of dudes trying to get pussy that are at that show with the girl they're trying to get pussy for. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. You know, so it's like how do you, it's putting, it's, it's that world where it operates in. And then the next thing is I think when I'm not there yet, but I get glimpses and it's like from nothing comes everything.

Speaker 2:          01:39:09       You know, like for me, I remember it for the show and the comedy store in La when you walked in, like that was crazy for me because obviously any comic, you're, you know, watching this show and you're seeing and you're like, man, it would be so cool. One day it'd be on Joe Rogan's podcast. Right. And then, but it was nothing I would ever ask for. Cause I stopped asking, I stopped feeling entitled to anything. I just decided like when you walked in, I was like, this is awesome because I never expect to see what I'm saying. I only do the shit that I want to do because I can control that. And if I just worry about expecting or wanting shit that I can't control being miserable. Right. So and you walked down and he did, he did the fucking show and you're like, you're like, hey, I heard some good stuff and we'll check it out. And I was like, that's fucking unreal. And I was overwhelmed because I didn't ever expected shit. And even in that moment I wouldn't ask you to come on and I didn't care if I didn't come on. I didn't give a fuck because I was so grateful that that had happened. It was almost like I was just true to comedy and all they wanted to do as good comedy and the fucking, that's how,

Speaker 3:          01:40:20       sorry, the universe's doors. That's it. That's it. That's fucking it. If you, especially in this world, the world that we live in, if you're doing real shit, people find out about find out, man, I hear about you. I heard about you through several people and I was like, really? Oh, okay, cool. Let me check them out. And then I saw some of your shit online. Like Ah, I could tell there's people that are doing the real thing. They're out there really doing comedy and they're trying to make things funny and they're talking about controversial subjects and talk about different things and their perspective in life and they're worried about the industry's opinion of him. And what you said was so true that in the day everybody was trying to get a sitcom man, and that's all they were doing. They were doing these acts like you would get actress who would get into comedy just so they could put together a seven minutes set.

Speaker 3:          01:41:07       Yeah. So they could get a sitcom off of it and then they would stop doing standup. It was a lot of that, but that world dried up when the sitcoms dried up and it happened right around the time that fear factor kicked because when fear factor kicked in, reality TV show squashed all these sitcoms. And it was really funny because some people were, it was, I had a, an argument with a comic about that and he's like, man, I just think it's fucked up that you, you're, you're doing a reality TV show and supporting reality TV. I go, why? He goes because it takes jobs away from comics that right on sitcoms. I go, hey man, I go, first of all, they're not writers on sitcoms. They'd taken a job writing on sitcoms while they're doing stand up comedy, they're fucking comics. Okay, I'm taking a job making people eat animal dicks while I'm doing calming the differences. I'm still doing comedy and these motherfuckers are just looking for some sort of a gravy train to ride off into the sunset. They're there. If the show was good, people would watch it instead of these reality shows and then it wouldn't exist anymore. But there was so many bad sitcoms that it opened the door to real housewives and all these other things and the next thing you know named me, name me three set go that are on right now.

Speaker 2:          01:42:21       Can, can I take it one step further? There'll never be another hit sitcom again. They probably won't. It is over. It's probably over and I'm walking around my, the agency that I'm with a yesterday and I'm talking to people and they don't get it. No Bro. If I felt like Christian Bale in the big short, I'm just walking around or it's over. It's over. Do you guys not know? We need to write a show around you. I'm like, guys, guys, guys, there's no more, you know, it's really over. Do you ever look at the fucking ratings for late night television? Okay, it's done. It's crazy. This is why this one's crazy. Flips up it. You just put your clips up in your clips up, Instagram, everything. Look, everything that I've, that I've done, it's for comics. Like don't think that like you're copying or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          01:43:05       It's for you. Look at the blueprint. Yeah, copy it. Improve it. Tell me how you improve it, but empower yourself. That's what this is for. The blueprint of putting things up on, using things up. Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, like any and like I have a lot of comics who reached out. Just ask questions, but I'm here as a resource for you. Comedy is at its best when we are helping each other and New York doesn't get that right now just yet. Well, there's less opportunity. That's, that's it. You know what happened in la, but the sit Compton bro, you're a fucking dude. It is so done. This is how you know, you know how I know it's done. What is your favorite scene in a sitcom or, or what top five scene. Just a scene you loved and a Sitcom.

Speaker 3:          01:43:45       Even though I was in a sitcom for five years. Yeah. And I don't really watched them, so, okay, fair enough. Well, I'll watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       but that's a single camera that doesn't, it's a little different cause there's like so audience, but like anybody's listening right now, right? Like you can think of one of your favorite scenes, right? Try to think of how that episode began. You don't know. Try to think about how it ended. You don't know. Right. Because the narrative was never important. The narrative was to fill 30 minutes of time. The only thing that was important where the five sketches that fill that 30 minutes of time, 22 minutes or 2022 yeah, exactly. So, so it's like those five sketches don't have to have that bullshit narrative. Right, right. So right now you really just need four or five friends that are doing the same kind of funny shit. We're already seeing the new sitcom right now. It's already existing. Well on Instagram it's just a not a good art form.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       You know, if you watch like the big bang or two and a half man and those are grandfathered in. Right. It's like that came from a time when it was there. But like they weren't, they're not entertaining. They certainly don't stand up. Like that's also why Netflix kicked in with a lot of their dramas. Cause they can get away with things on stranger things or on Ozark. They can get away with shit you just could never fucking do on regular television. It's way more wild. It's way more raw. It's like you're watching a better movie. They not only does, cause it used to be that if you did film, you didn't want to do television cause television sucked. Right. Like television, you do an air wolf or something like that and doing something terrible shit. It's obvious. You see it coming a mile away. It's made for morons.

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       Yeah. Yeah. Or, you know, you did film and if you did film boy, you got a chance to work with some of the most amazing directors and do these incredible pieces. But Netflix came along and, and really it was before Netflix Soprano's laid the blueprint, exact surprised wire the wire. I didn't watch the wire, but it did the same sort of thing, right? They created a new movie every week and it all went together and it lasted a hundred hours. Right? And so you're like, oh my God. Well regular movies is so shallow. I got not even getting into the characters. Right? Yeah, this guys, 10 years later, you see him 10 years later and the same movie, right? He's got a beard. Fuck is this, this is terrible. And, and why is it because movies got so expensive to make. You couldn't take risks on stories that we didn't already know about.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       Movies became 200 or a hundred million. Now if I go to you and I'm like, okay, give me 200 million to make a movie about, it's this a mob guy and he's Kinda got like some anxiety you like, are you out of your fucking mind? But if I say, give me 200 million to make a movie about marvel, it's like, oh, that's an existing fan base. Is it based on a book or a comic? So right now the only movies we see are either big budget that have a built in audience or $3 million comedy. Right. That middle grounds right there. That used to be awesome movies. TV. Yeah. So now TV is the shit. It's all these dope stores like breaking bad should have been a movie, but they turn that motherfucker into a TV show. A betters. Yeah. And they

Speaker 3:          01:46:49       were restricted because it's cable. There was an HBO, right. And they had commercials and all that stupid shit. Yeah. I mean, what happened was with comics was the internet came along and all the sudden there was these, this wealth of avenues where comedians could show their work. Whereas before you were limited by the gatekeepers. The gatekeepers were either sitcoms and the sitcoms was what everybody wanted to get. Cause you've got to sit calm. Then you were all set. You were Jerry Seinfeld or you were Roseanne. Yup. And then it became something along the line. Russell and you like both guys. Russell Peters in particular. Yeah. Became gigantic selling out arenas from youtube. That's where it came. I put little clips is shit came up. And if you ever met Russell, he's one of the most generous guys in the world. Super Generous. I know him comics who's rentees paid, he's the best.

Speaker 3:          01:47:41       He's just such a great guy. But he's also a guy that recognizes that you got to give some back. You gotta be, and this just has his personality. He's just so gregarious, outgoing guy. All these podcasts that popped up, people realize like, Hey, you know, we're not in competition with each other like Jay Leno and David Letterman work. Cause everybody wanted the tonight show spot. Right now there's a thousand tonight shows and if you have the tonight show and I have the tonight show, I'm like, hey, you should check out Andrew's tonight show. It's fucking great. Like this is okay.

Speaker 2:          01:48:11       This is the tonight show your Carson. But we figured out a way, Carson. Now, do you know that? Right? That's the difference. That's the shift. That's why Netflix can't even compete. Netflix has done, Dana had done, done, what are you talking about? You see Charlie Wilson's war, no movie about Tom Hanks movie about America getting an a evolved with the Afghan conflict and Afghanistan war doesn't really matter, but the idea is yes, they're fighting the Russians, the Afghanis, right? Right. So the Americans go, okay, boom, give them a $5,000 rocket launcher and they're going to shoot down a $5 million helicopter and eventually Russia just won't be able to compete, right? Netflix pays $100 million to Aaron Sorkin or whoever to make a TV show, right? Right. The distracts you for two hours, right? Youtube pay zero million dollars to Joe Rogan and Jamie to make a podcast that distracts you for two hours every day. Netflix cannot compete,

Speaker 3:          01:49:10       but it's a different animal. You got to realize, first of all, they have way more people than just me. They also are putting together something that requires a lot of money to create. Sure. You enjoy films. Yes, yes. Or if you enjoy a show like Ozar, sure. Stranger things along for narrative. It takes a lot of money to make those things are special effects. There's camera people and makeup people in here. There's a lot of lock on art directors and producers and actors and he'd say giant fucking tense or with Pete, but people aren't watching it. You know what they're watching. People are watching that. They're watching friends. No, no, no, no, no. In free, dude. There's a reason they paid us terrible. Does it matter if it's as Jamie

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       the most two most viewed shows on Netflix right now? Netflix doesn't own, okay. Netflix isn't even trying to make money anymore. They're getting bought out. It's Facebook, Amazon, but they want it. That's the goal of the strategy. Now the 10 billion in debt, there's no way they can make money. There's 10 billion and billion, billion, but they make hundreds of millions of dollars a month. Like how many people do they have on board? How many subscribers do they have that are paying $9 as far as I know, they don't share that information. They're killing it in terms of subscribers, but they're 10 billion in debt. They just talk on another 2 billion. Right. When I say Netflix has done, I'm speaking when anytime I make declarations, I'm speaking in the future. Right? We prepare now for the future, right? So it's like how will they hear it goes? Netflix will keep friends through next year and $100 million payment.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       $100 million, right? For one year friends and then the office to know what that is though. That's like nostalgia style Jack. Right? So all viewing right now is nostalgia even? Well, not all of you. If you look at TV, right? What the great, this, this, this past year is in TV, right? The OJ trial and FX. What does that, I remember how it was when the Oj thing came out. Did Not do that great. Killed it. Won all the awards, everything. The Versace story, which was another thing like what? That out of the loop, I'm just 39 million. 139 million subscribers paying $10 a month. Is that what it is? How much the cross like that? Maybe even more. Maybe 11 how much of the cost? They just bumped it up to 12 I think 12 bucks a month. Sure. That ladies and gentlemen is a fuck load of income.

Speaker 1:          01:51:16       Sure. So they got a lot coming in, but they're spending a lot too because they're trying to hundred 30 they're trying to overtake all the others and then they got Jeff Bezos, you know captain money bags up there. A scrooge McDuck right. He's trying to do the same thing. Facebook shoebox. Just where I saw you on the pee pee. Yeah. I was like, yeah, true. But that's thing basles can lose money on this shit because he's making tons of money on paper towels and what, whatever. How much he is losing because he's got a lot of fucking series at. Ain't nobody watching them that put it out there, but he's doing something that's even more weird. Okay. Because there's no one watching those shows. Yeah, there's a ton of fucking shows on Amazon. No fucking no one's watching. I would like to see their numbers cause I bet they have some shows they might, they might have spent $1 million to make and have like four viewers.

Speaker 1:          01:52:02       There's fucking no one watched these shows. They were just going after awards. They're thing was we're going to make the artsy shit, it's going to give us a grammy or something like that and then we'll like qualify our platform. It's a smart approach. Like Youtube, his approach was the exact opposite, right. We're like, we're just going to create this stuff that we think people want to watch. Well Youtube doesn't create much. They did a little and they took down the paywall. Like my thing I, my guests with youtube is there waiting for Netflix. You know that scene in the movie where like that somebody, somebody's caught in like an enclosed space and water starts coming in and the water gets right up to like his lips, you know, he's like, he's trying to breathe a little bit more and I think youtube is going to be the one to pour the last drop of water.

Speaker 1:          01:52:42       Well I think it's such a different thing. I think you're talking about totally different things because Netflix has never aimed to be a user created content streaming site. Right? The right they're not, but at the end of the day it's just distraction I think. I think that's what we've got to start looking at content as right is it, it's just raw distraction and Netflix occupies a space for distraction did smaller than youtube, so I can watch a two hour thing on youtube at home on my TV. I can watch a two minute thing on the bus as I'm going to work on youtube, you know, I can watch a 15 minute, you know, peace like Vlog or something like that. I can watch all the whole spectrum. Netflix. I'm really just watching at home or like a foam on a trip. You know what I mean? It's really, I'm not watching a two minute thing on Netflix.

Speaker 1:          01:53:27       You know what I mean? It's, it is the shit for now. Don't get me wrong. It absolutely the shit for now. Right. But if I was being, if I'm putting my money on it, I would say if I'm Facebook, I buy it. And then imagine having your Facebook feed, you just watched a show and then you get to share it immediately on your Facebook followers. Facebook, I'd be super careful about buying anything cause I think the government's been thinking about breaking them up for a while and Elizabeth Warren is already talking about that. That's one of the parts of her platform and running for president is breaking up apple, breaking up Facebook, breaking up Twitter. She wants to break up all these things she thinks are monopolies. What's your feeling on that? Get the fuck Outta here with that shit is goofy is goofy's fuck. What's up?

Speaker 1:          01:54:14       Disney takeover of 21st century Fox takes place, I think next week. The 20th to Bega. They're going to put out their own streaming, everything. They've just, they've bought like everything except for Fox News and Fox sports took over all of their production movie facilities. It's like 5,000 people might be losing their job because all that contents coming off a Netflix, all those marvel shows, all that shit is going to come over to them. So now they're going to have a nice, they've been canceling all these marvel shows on Netflix. I keep investing in something that you're going to take off, like I'm going to build up a brand and then you're going to remove it, right? They've got, so they got all the kids movies. You're a bear a dad, you know what I mean? Dude, I go to Disneyland twice a year at least. Which you're gonna not have a streaming Disney program.

Speaker 1:          01:54:58       Apple's also starting their streaming service soon tomorrow or some shit on those win. But there's a bunch, I'm, tons of rumors are comfortable today. You know what it's like, you know, the perestroika, like what happened in Russia, like where the, uh, overnight, you know, it fell and they sold off the state assets. Like a few people and everybody came. Billionaires, right. That's what's happening right now in entertainment, dude. People don't realize it, but like it's fucking done. Like the days of the days of like fame being about distance are done. Distance, distance. Like I'm Johnny Depp. I'm going to go away to my like little home somewhere in the Alps and you will see me twice a year. You're not, I'm weird. Or Marlon Brando. I'm, I'm out here. I'm weird. I'm different. You know. It's like now it's proximity. There's a reason why no value in being weird anymore. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       Marlon Brando. Tyler Perry has an island, bro. Really? That's interesting. Have you been invited? No. No. That's fucked up. I don't want to go. I ain't going to anybody's fucking island. That's my rule. Bronson. Somebody wants to ask what's in the Virgin Dude? Richard Bronson or whatever his name is. Johnson Branson. Yank on his fucking island. I don't want to hang out with a dude with Branson. Why? Why? When I could jet ski with Joey. T is, listen, I ain't, I don't know. Hanging out with any dude who has an island. Get the fuck Outta here. Mccone or island because they always want you to go to the island. Like, bitch, I ain't going to, your island is going to the diner. No. Who, who's that? Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy has an island. Yep. What would you get up? You go to Eddie's. I'm might go daddy's. He got it. Got It. I like Getty.

Speaker 4:          01:56:31       I met Eddie and I was good friends with his brother and good guy. Petrolia was the best. Charlie was the greatest guy of all time. Yeah. Uh, I met Eddie when, when I met Eddie Murphy, I met Eddie Murphy in Maui and he'd go it first words out of his mouth. He goes, you are funny, motherfucker. I was like, God damn. Yes. This is recently, no years ago. Maybe more than 10 years ago. Yeah. That's like 2007 something like that. It'd be unreal. Crazy funny. In Hawaii with my family, I'll say thank you. Like, what do you say when Eddie Murphy says you're a funny motherfucker? I'm like, Holy Shit. Wow. It felt great. You know, she looked at your wife and be like see chuckle every once in a while. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:57:20       Honestly, at home, I'm not that funny. My wife cracks most of the jokes. Really? Yeah. I don't have to be funny like a, I don't need it. You know, it's one of the reasons why I like to hang around with Joey Diaz cause he's always funny and he's always the funny guy. You know? I like it. It's uh, you know, I like being around funny people, man. I'm not, the thing about comics, especially the needy annoying ones and the early days, like early days of your career, they have to be the center of attention. Yeah. That shit is really annoying. And one of the things that you learned for sure about hosting a podcast is you don't really want to be the center of attention. You just want to facilitate a conversation. You just want to make the best creation. What's the best creation? The best creation is let this guy rant.

Speaker 4:          01:58:07       You gotta let them rent. Get out of the way. If the best creation as rent with them, you jump in together and you'd go back and forth like a game of tennis, then you do it that way, but you have to be able to feel the vibe and then some people are not going to like it that way. They're going to want it. Well, why don't you let your guests talk? Like people love to say shit like that. Like you wonder why you interrupted his rants. I love to say things like that. See like you're trying to make a creation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a, comics are not great listeners. Some of them are as well. The ones that are are great at this. Yeah. Right. And uh, the ones that are, it's tough for them to do this and people know, man, they, it's, it's

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       how, how comfortable is it when it gets in through their ears? Yeah. Like is it getting an easy or is it like, oh, this guy's on.

Speaker 4:          01:58:50       No, yeah, yeah. I'll bring on a guest here. The guests say something and I just cringe because I anticipate the comments. I'm just like, dude, you're about to get crushed by the weight of the world. Will you?

Speaker 3:          01:59:04       Well, you quiet somebody. No, I mean if I have to, uh, try not to, if I have to correct them, like if they're saying something that I know to be inaccurate, if it's in my wheelhouse, like sometimes people say something and I'll just say that's not, that's not true. Here's why that's not true. You know, I've had people say some goofy shit and it just happens to be something I know a lot about and then I have to stop it. Yeah, okay. That makes, that makes sense. But for the most part, I, I want people to just be themselves. I got to figure out how to get you to be yourself. That's what a lot of this is comfortable make you realize that. I just want you to do great. I want everybody to do great. Are you ever intimidated by a guest? By their intellect? Yeah. Like Elon Musk was intimidating talking to him cause you realize what a champ you are still that way. Oh yeah. I'm a fucking dummy man. But like talking to this guy, I'm like, I'm a fucking chimp. Here's a question.

Speaker 4:          02:00:01       He's just kind of like a champ one should I got to go to Mars? Huh. Cool wants smokes weed.

Speaker 3:          02:00:11       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:00:14       He's got a big a cut of that mother making electric cars, you know, sending rockets into the space. He's drilling holes under the ground. You had to dumb them down with Megan solar cities.

Speaker 2:          02:00:28       We didn't even, didn't even work, but, so here's my take on it. Right. I'm watching Musk. Right. And he basically is opening up to you about how he's not happy. Yeah, right. There's this moment where he's like, I think he said something to stand of you one want to be me. Yeah. He's just as his exact words. He wouldn't want to be mean. You wouldn't want to be me. So that means he doesn't want to be him. I think on some level he doesn't want to be him. Right. And he's so with these guys that we admire because they're so brilliant and they have all these brilliant ideas and we're, we're putting this matrix of we're all in this success matrix. On some level, right? Where it's like get things done good. Don't they can get things on bad. Right? I wonder if if he's chimp ish in that he's potentially wasting his life being upset or miserable when he could be focusing on things that would give them joy. Is that being, is that being a fucking chimp is being so smart that you don't even try to just be happy and focus on your happiness? I don't

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       necessarily think he's unhappy, but I do think that he puts himself into situations where the amount of stress that he absorbs is almost unfathomable. Like when he was trying to get the Tesla model three production re scheduled ramped up and he was sleeping on the floor of the factory and working literally working like 1920 hours a day. That that's untenable. You can only do that for short periods of time. Right. But I think that what I was saying about Kanye West applies to him tenfold. Okay. He's, he's got a power output that's extraordinarily different than the average person. And that's one of the things he was talking about when he was young. I mean, you could probably put him on some sort of, uh, W W I don't know what the super genius spectrum is, right? Like what is, you know, what's, what's Albert Einstein, right? What's, what's this guy?

Speaker 3:          02:02:28       What's that guy? He's in there somewhere and it's crazy realm of the way your brain works. Like, I think the brains are like all other body parts. Some people born with little tiny dicks and some people got giant hogs and that's just a fact. And I think that dude has a giant hot of a brain and it just works better. It just, it just is operating on a level that you and I can't, we can't comprehend. But I never invented a God damn thing in my life. But I'm driving around and Elon Musk's car, you know, that mother fucker made a car and that's like some shitty does on the side. You know, his car thing is like, after he invented paypal and he's, by the way, while he's doing the car, he shoot rockets into space and drilling holes into the ground. He's trying to move traffic on the ground.

Speaker 3:          02:03:18       It's trying to fuck it. He's making solar cities like he's, he's hooking up Australia with these massive solar panel power battery plants and fucking fix their energy needs. He's, he's on another level. No doubt. On another level it's a different thing, but so is he happy gel? I don't know. And that's a nice guy that was hanging around with him. He seems happy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it does. There was what is happy, right? Is He happy in bursts when, well, I guarantee you when I saw him and he was shooting his fucking flame thrower and my, my four, Yay. He was happy. You're four. Yay. Yeah. Right out here, man. Yeah. He had a fucking flame thrower. He was tapping that bitch when he walked into the door. He's unboxing it in the middle of this hallway out here got flames. There's a picture of him standing in front of the Freak Party sign blown flames out freely. I fucking guy's a maniac. Look at the smile on his face. He can't tell me he's not happy, Bro. You know what? Look at that smile. He's happy as fuck. It's cause he's a kid, man. Yeah. We're just a lot of ways. There's this, there's this fucking guy, I forget his name is doctor a wrap or a pie or something like that. He's like, his French consulting is like some fucking genius and he's like decoded cultures, right? And uh,

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       every culture he's Dakota and he, people hire him to consult. Right? And like America's code is a, it's a, the verb is to do and the time is now. Right. And we're just kids at the end of the day. Right. It's like everything. We love big tits in America, right? Most popular product is big tits and like France, most popular project surgeries, getting tits reduced, right. Everything about them is like precision and like

Speaker 4:          02:05:02       the food on the plate, they're most popular plastics. That's what I was talking to my buddy and that's what he said. And maybe it's changed to like lips or something more common now, but maybe the one you have to go under episode or dark one. Don't fuck with your lips ladies. I like it when they get a little lips. If they have not, if you have a fucking beak, but then do you want to have a little something? You see the, the thing in there, it's like, like let's, you know, they're extra needy. There's like something going on. They wanted the, they wanted their lips to be, you know, there's like a symmetrical proportion that your face is supposed to fall into this Fibonacci sequence of numbers and if you get a nose job, I look at you and I go, Whoa, what's wrong with it is like something is wrong.

Speaker 4:          02:05:41       It registers wrong in my head because your face, so like Ari, perfect example. It's already got a nose job. You're like, what the fuck is happening here? Yes. What's wrong with your face? But you've already had like a small Irish person's nose. He'd be like, what is happening here? This doesn't even make any sense. Not for his face, his face. It's that there's a sequence, like your lips match your face. They, they match how far your eyes are a part where your nose is. We see a girl and she's a little tiny little skinny thing with little fingers and all of a sudden she's got this yes, these big weird lips don't we like things that like stand out. Like we like skinny with big tits. We do drawn to it. Right. Things are abnormally do most big slot. It's a trick. The big tip one is a trick because it, it represents like sexual viability.

Speaker 4:          02:06:28       It represents your ability to breastfeed a child which is attractive to your genes. Doesn't make any sense. Yeah. I said you would know that there's a bag of water underneath her skin that she had a tube down her throat taped to her face. She's half dead. They're cutting our open with a sharp knife and scuffing this bag of water under the meat of her breast tissue or they're cutting her nipple often opening up like a fucking man hole cover and pumping that fucker in there. It's crazy. Like we know that that's what happened and we still think it's hot. The all those things are nuts. Chilean bro. Yeah. Yeah. In here, we can't help it, but

Speaker 5:          02:07:08       like it bothers me when it's a, but when it's a fake, but it bothers me.

Speaker 4:          02:07:14       Like if there was a way that a girl could lift weights at the gym and make her tits bigger and she went and got fake tits, wouldn't like him as much. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Knowing you can earn it. Yeah. You could earn it. I might. Yeah. It's lazy. Lazy. Yeah. Yeah. But thing is, it throws you off if it doesn't match the legs. Like if a girl's got a big, but it's got some legs, like damn bitch is dead lift. You know, like that's hot. Yeah. It's like, I've never said that in my head, but I know what you're talking. You never said this. Bitches deadlift putting up. I see a girl with big, big hamstrings. Bitch could squat. Death isn't, I say that all the time. Just don't work out enough. I guess. I was like girls with legs that looked like ticking carry shit.

Speaker 4:          02:07:54       Yeah, it's hot. Yeah. Do you like the girl? I'm heavy of the girls carrying me around. She's going to get tired, but it, but I like girls that are athletic but of power. You know, I like it. It's hot. So if a girl's got a big ass cause she's squatting, that's hot. The girls get a big ass cause she went through surgery. I'm like, bitch, you're going to get cancer as cancer now. Do you know that from implants? Yes. They're starting to see cases of bud cans. Whoa, Jack. That's what I'm talking about son, Bro. That's power. That's too strong for me. Oh, don't be scared. I'm afraid of that. That girl hurt you. Yeah, that is, that's like trying to fuck up crossfitters fist. You know what I'm saying? Like the power she must have in that Bro. Look at that leg dude. And attaches a hawk.

Speaker 4:          02:08:47       Outstanding. I mean the butt cheeks or anything. It's the thigh meat. It's too much. He's a athlete. I like it. Yeah. I don't know like that. If that girl's in a miniskirt, but if she's not flexing Cipro looks hot as fuck you. So you were into a very strong, yeah, I like good jeans, this kind of thing. Other ones, Jamie. I mean this girl has stacked that girl stacked. The only problem with those gals is that there is a reality to certain levels of musculature that most likely they're only achieved by injecting male hormones. So the cliques kind of get big or whatever. Have you never seen that? Are you allowed to like fuck around? What's your relationship with your wife? Definitely not. No. No. No. Okay. Okay. How long have you been married? 10 years. 10 years, okay. And then how do you, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:09:37       How do you navigate that? No, Jay yet. Can you please explain to me what need you do this? Wait, Jack will help. Exactly. How does it work? Yeah. This, this level of athleticism. I was saying like there's like a certain line that there are, they are crossing, most likely is because of male hormones. Yeah. I can't get into it. There's, there's some level of that. Did they grow some hair? Jujitsu girls, there's a lot of Jujitsu girls that are competitive. Jiu Jitsu girls that started doing a little bit of steroids. They started taking a little bit of testosterone. Like a friend of mine's wife was doing it and I was like, yikes. Yeah. She's really getting into a Jujitsu. She's competing and she's starting to take a little bit of testosterone. I was like, Oh, you know what happens? They get horny where he only like a dude.

Speaker 4:          02:10:21       Really? Yeah, but they've got this big dangling clay on or know it only gets big when they go whole hog. Like when they go bodybuilder. How Nagel bodybuilder big. No, never way back in the day. They never fucked a girl was a bodybuilder. Never once ever just fuck. The girl was like, like very fit and strong, but she had a normal vagina. Normal. Totally normal. She has a six pack though. It's kind of weird. Okay. Yeah. It's a little soft feminine. But this clip thing fascinates me, so declared it just is there like, is that, you can't put a picture of that up. Can we look at that?

Speaker 4:          02:10:57       Can you pull it up when it doesn't? You know what? It is a little Dick. It's like a little deck. That's what I'm wondering. Does it have like the head and like the race? Oh yeah. Fuck you ever see here, Bro. You saying you've never looked at in large clits you never done that. It's exactly what I'm saying. If you've never done it, Google search. I looked fake pussies. I looked up like training pussies, but I didn't look up and those are good. What do you mean the training buzzy? What do you mean they're not good? Like date? Sound good. It's not real. Yeah, I know it's not real, but you want to be able to tell. Can you tell? No, but I feel like there's a dick on inside and nut. That one down there.

Speaker 4:          02:11:37       Yeah. That's what happens. It's not real. It is real. It is real way. No, no, no, it is no way. How about that one in the lower right hand, upper right hand corner. The dark one. Jamie below that. That one. Pow. How'd you like me now? That's a dick. She has balls. Yeah. No, no. That's pussy lips, bro. That's not, that's not a girl. That's Paul's lips. Doug Pussy Lips. Now that one down there. What about the giant one below that Jamie did the ones that middle. What's happening there? No, Bro, that just looks like a witch finger is gnarly. That's Photoshop has to be from my dude, dude. This is awesome. Free Porn. Mm. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:12:24       Oh Dude. Well, when girls take a lot of testosterone, they do develop enlarge clits. There was a a a show on HBO back in the day, I think it was called private dicks, but it was like that girl's Jack. You're into that though? No, that's a little much. Yeah. Dillashaw yeah, that's hilarious. She's pretty looking now. She wasn't flexing, told to eat a couple of sandwiches. Oh. Anyway, let's get out of there. That's, that's enough. We're going to start vomiting mood. But anyway, there was a show on HBO called Private Dicks and one of the people on it, I think that was from that show, but anyway, there was this lady who was talking about, she became a, a trans man and by through taking massive amounts of testosterone, her clit grew. She said to the size of a thumb. Yeah, because they're taking, I don't even understand what's going on.

Speaker 4:          02:13:20       High levels of testosterone to sort of achieve that. They get hair on their face. They're boys DPA. Yeah. You know, they get broader and thicker and they keep a lot of that too. I, I don't get it. I don't understand. So your clit is just, your is just a cock essentially, right? Well, not really. It just resembles one. I mean if you looked at that, if my dick look, I thought I'd go right to the doctor. I'm like, which one? We were looking at the cook and one which is finger joints. It seems like a joint. It seems like a club with no skin or get dick with no skin. It has been. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:13:56       That made me feel uncomfortable to look at. It should match and pulling a girl's panties and shit. That thing fucking happen to a friend of mine's boyfriend, a friend of mine who I used to work with on a television show her, she was the story about her ex boyfriend met this girl and they're fooling around and they get back to her butt and she was pretty feminine, but she had a click, like a pinky is the way he described it and then he pulled her pants down and then fucking panicked and then said, oh my God, I have to pick my friend up at the airport. Fuck, I can't believe this. And he just, that was his excuse is I got to pick one panty man. The dude panicked. He went into a full blown panic and just ran out. He couldn't deal with her clit.

Speaker 4:          02:14:38       I mean it gets to a certain size where that's like at, look, it's wrapped around her leg and tied in a bow. You're like, oh you to like kind of like push it to the side to insert. You gotta hold it like a handle all your banners and choice. Fuck it. It's like the, the reins on a horse, like you're hanging onto it. Where you're bang on. Oh, it's like just the random shape of the human body and how we've decided that this is what's appealing. Right. Hourglass figure. The ask comes out, the tits are here. It makes it look like she's like sexually viable. She'll be good at like the big ass and all that fat around that area means she's got a plenty, plenty of nutrients for the child. Got Wide Hips. It means a baby's gonna come out easy. All those things are like directly connected to fertility.

Speaker 4:          02:15:29       So we're not objectifying them at all. Well, we are, but it's nature that's caught. Like there's a reason why the standard that men are after when it comes to women is directly connected to them. It actually makes some kids, so me thinking, you know, you have great, you know, hips are tits or something like that is efficient. Yeah. It's not sexist. It's not hateful. It's not in any way objectifying. Or maybe we're supposed to objectify to create people. Hmm. I think there's that too. But then there's also like if a girl's really good shape, one of the things that you admire is that that girl's got, she's got disciplined and power, like go girls hitting the gym all the time and working on all a girl gets things done. Like if you see a girl and she's lazy and her body is just like soft doughy, she's like skinny fat, like, like, oh, you're going to complain a lot.

Speaker 4:          02:16:21       You're going to meet a lot of naps. Yay. You know what I mean? You know it up after this kid getting after it. Yeah. You know, I have to get things done now. You're going to want to be, you want to be sad, you're going to want to complain. You're going to want to stay home and stop. But is that biological or is that a smart, do you think it is? Yeah. There's something biological to it. Your body rejects that because you know that this girl, like if the shit hits the fan and a fucking apocalypse comes, you gotta take your children and go to the mountains. Right. This girl is going to be tired all the time. I'm just going to complain. It's going to weigh you down. It's not going to carry your own weight. I'll like a gal who can carry your own weight. Right, and you can't do that if you're carrying a big old clit hurry up, dragging your clit all over the rocks. We got leaves stuck to it. Shit.

Speaker 4:          02:17:08       Dog's Dick Dog. No, no. Imagine if women had, and men had pussies and we were just really into big dicks to just as possible. Absolutely called gay guys, but no, the arbitrary shape it like strange, strange. You're a trashy. This isn't the male. Seahorses have a pussy while the male seahorse excepts eggs from the female. This actually video of it sounds pretty great. That's pretty fucking gay brown eggs. Yeah. He, she pours her eggs into a sack in his body. It's very strange. It looks like they're kissing while they do it. It's really weird, right? I'm okay with, Oh, you've got a video of it. Oh yeah. Here it is. Shit. In perspective, when you look at the weird fucking animal, a sea horses anyway, like what a strange little creature. It's so weird. I think that's why we like nature stuff because it like, it puts in perspective how fucked up humans are.

Speaker 4:          02:18:10       Look at that dude. That's, that's her. Him. Is that him giving birth do, that's how I come with cow. Look at that kicks back and shotgun dude come the opposite way. I've go forward and I don't get back out. I feel like if you back on, it's like pulling back on a punch. Yeah. But you gotta match one of those ones that stuck in there. One of them little baby seahorses is like, ah, I'm in it forever. Shit. Cause he's, the last of them is like the last is like one or two at a time. So you're like one guy. Oh boy. That's the last draw. He's just, he keeps popping, but there's nothing coming out. Okay. Those are babies are, those are sperm babies. So we didn't see them like, uh, have sex with each other. Maybe hatches inside of his body. Yeah. That's crazy dude.

Speaker 4:          02:18:59       Thank God I got to do that. I imagine all that. What a drag. Did your, did your wife do natural now? See? Oh No, no, no, no, no, no. How'd she get it out? Oh, I mean natural and that, but like, yeah, a c section, ga epidural man. The csection thing, they have to, I mean with some women it's imperative they have to do it. Like maybe they have small hips, right? You date one of those, like a little girl, take one of them bent big giant dudes Grill Fox, you know what I mean? And then he got a giant baby side you and a little tiny pussy loving. I am fascinated by it when like if you ever seen that guy, the guy from game of Thrones, the guy on the mountain, the mountain was this little tiny. She's standing up, she weighs three pounds.

Speaker 4:          02:19:47       Let's see, she looks like a chick. She's smaller in comparison to him. Then my eight year old is in comparison to mill. Yup. Look at that. Oh, he is smoking that dude. Oh, how is that humanly possible that that works? She's this beautiful little tiny creature and he's one of the biggest human beings on the planet. He's packing. I don't think he's packing. Are you talking? I think he's got a big piece. He's got a dick. Like everything else you see on him. If he didn't have a dick like that, you'd be stunned by the size of his hands, his shoulders. He probably has a small seal in his pants.

Speaker 4:          02:20:25       He's going to tee shirts. A strong mother fuckers be like besides Dick? Yeah, big giant fucking ant eater or on elephant trunk. That's, that's, oh wow. I don't know if he got the peace man big. If you had a piece like that. He's a savage. She's from fucking Iceland. That's what they do. There are different humans out there, man. Those are vikings. There's a reason why he's that big. No bullshit. That is Viking DNA. It's just the best. Years ago, guys like him would be on a boat where they fucking dragon on the front of the boat and they'd have a sword and they couldn't wait to jump off that fucking boat and start hacking people to bits. That's why that guy exists. That's why he's so big and you just took the best genetics from wherever you've stopped. It's why Iceland vice did a whole piece on Iceland.

Speaker 4:          02:21:15       Okay. But all of the strong men, competition winners, it live in Iceland. They're all vikings. Mad. It's Viking DNA. Really? 100% okay. But isn't Viking DNA. Okay? We went to Italy, we raped some chicks in Italy. We bring them back. They bring back the best women, but they're the ones who survive all these battles. This is tested at other duties to survive. We're all big. Yeah, that's true. These guys are so big, man. If you got to read this article, had vice did on these strong men in Iceland. Okay. It's crazy bro. Yeah, yeah. As a whole country filled with gorilla gorillas that are just smashing pussy and lifting weights and throwing fucking beer barrels over the top of train link fences there. It's huge. There's a apparently that there's an APP in Iceland to make sure you don't fuck your family member that ass bro. Cause there's only, there's only like 300,000 people right on the island. So everybody, not everybody, a lot of people are very related so you can like type your name in. Oh say oh your grandson, all your organs in our

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       second cousins family. Not Fuck. Oh, with a drum by the bed. I got to do beat the drum. Boom, boom. The gimme a pace to go to jam. That's a crazy, crazy race of humans, man. You ever go there? No. No. I'd like to go. I'd like to go there just to see the northern lights. It's one of the things that I've been thinking that I need. Have you been where you saw them? I didn't sign up there. What is it? Oh you did? Yeah. Normally in Alaska it's harder in the city when you're just say, but uh, yeah, they love stand up there. I think like, I think they're they're president or something. It was like a huge Stan hope fan. They liked good stand up to make sure I'm not misquoting but like a pair. I think he was a like a massive, a duck. Stan Hope Fan.

Speaker 5:          02:23:16       They were good man. They like no English. They're like apparently the KFC there, KFC one KFC, it's popular as fuck. Well, the rules for food are super like high, so it's like the best chicken tenders you ever had. Oh, because they don't let process bullshit. None of that. Right, but it's still KFC, so you could do that when you have a country that has as many people as Boulder, Colorado. That's the thing people don't get, like when you got to feed 300 million people, it's like we're going to jam out some shit, Bro. Like we're going to use corn, 300 million people. It's a lot of people. It's like when a mom has nine kids, it's like it's going to be some grits. Yeah, yeah. Mcdonald's is going to work, but yeah, Iceland was a shit in the northern lights. You look at northern lights and you're like, oh, I completely get why people believed in God.

Speaker 5:          02:24:01       Oh yeah. Like you can't not. Does that make sense? Sure. You look in the sky and it's painting itself. You're going to believe what did they think it was back then? Had to be the gods dancing. I wonder what they thought. I'm wondering what ex explanation they had for the northern lights. How do you not like years ago. I don't know man. Sometimes the more I like look at, I was raised without any religion, but like the more I look at it now, I think it's just people trying to explain. It was like, it was like people just look at that. It's not a real color. Minnesota. Yeah. Yeah. You can see it. Wow. But go to another one for me. I didn't experience right. Guess Novitsky it's more just that name. Dirk Nowitzki are probably thinking, oh no, I've heard that name to Travis Novitsky. Is He, um, what's that got to do? Is he just a famous photographer? Perhaps try to follow yeah. Photography by Travis Novitsky. Yeah, I think that's what it is. I think. I think I've seen his, yeah, I think he does a lot of nature shit.

Speaker 5:          02:25:05       Yup. How could you not dude? Like how can you, how do you blame anybody for, for believing in something bigger? Oh, just a lightning storm, man. A hurricane. Like we live in big cities. This shit is not real. You live in The Bahamas and you see the power of a fucking hurricane. It puts things in perspective. You know how important we think we are. That goes away when you know at the blink of an eye, your house, everything you work for is gone because of wind, wind and water. Holy Shit. Shit. Right there. Look at that picture. That's where it's crazy. Wow. Says Northern. The lights now appear in central Europe and is because of climate change. Well isn't he supposed to get hotter? I don't know what that means. Like why is it saying well go to that article. Why is it saying that northern light now up here.

Speaker 5:          02:25:54       What? What does that go? Scroll down. Scroll down. No, it says Europe, much of the US Central Europe and much of the U S I didn't know that much of the u s says northern lights. You can see him in Ohio. Sometimes Alaska. You can see the norm. You've seen it. I have not. But um, I mean the other picture you share on an Minnesota, you fucking Ohio people do an ass in the parking lot. Seeing the lights in the sky. Yeah. There's that fucking big storm is hitting central us today. Right? Fuck. Then like Denver where they call it a bomb. A bomb cyclone has it's clickbait. Margaret Marketing. Good marketing. Is it a bomb? Like why are they calling it a bomb? Because you're going to read the article of is a bomb, right? Bombs are scary to marketing's fucking everything. I thought this shit like, like when we were just talking about the uncircumcised, like, like that. Even that term is so dumb, right? It's a normal dick. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. It's a dick. Why don't we, why would we even use that?

Speaker 5:          02:26:50       Yeah. Right. Well, what's crazy is it, it's more common to be cut. You're D it's more common than a dick is sliced off when you're a baby. They take the cap off than it is, and then when it's not, we're like, what's, why didn't your parents cut your cock when you were born? What about that? Why do you have the blanket over the top of the head? I cut that off. Expose that. Dry that head out. Yeah. Weird. Yeah. It's just sitting there. You get people to believe anything. It's like you got to grow it into them. You know, there's this, uh, I feel like I tell the story every single time talking on podcast, but like there's this great thing about how Nescafe broke into the Japanese market. Have you heard about this? And it's like they went to this consultant, they're asking them how do we get in?

Speaker 5:          02:27:35       And then he's like, you can't get in. And they're like, what do you mean? You're saying it's going to be 15 years? And I will be talking about, and he goes, well, they don't know what the fuck coffee is over there. Okay, you're trying to be tea or not tea. So what you're gonna do is you're going to make a cartoon and you're going to spend some few million on that and then you're gonna make a candy based on a cartoon. And then that candy is going to be flavored as coffee. And when these kids grow up, they're going to have this memory of coffee and the flavor of the smell of coffee. And I think last week they just opened the biggest Starbucks in the world and Tokyo and these people devour coffee like no other. And the idea is like the takeaway for me, the reason why I tell the story all the time, it's like change comes from underneath, you know what I mean? Is this how they approached it? They actually did it that way. That's, that's, that's the same guy, the

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       consultant [inaudible] I think his name is and he's a book or something. I'll call the culture code. My buddy is doing like a series with him trying to break it down, but the idea is like if you want to change any same reason why I did my shit on youtube, it's like if you want to change any industry or something like that, it's never going to come within the traditional structure. You know what I mean? It's like I would never be able to do the type of jokes I was doing on, on. Maybe you are in the bigs can but me. They'd be like, I don't that jokes about, you know, trans people, you can do that, et cetera. So it's like if I want to make it okay, I got to do it outside. You don't have to go a little bit outside of the industry and make it okay and way they were thinking was, hey, let's get underneath and just fucking grow these ideas in.

Speaker 4:          02:29:05       That's why we fight wars over ideas all the time. Right. It's like people understand Oh shit, and people start believing in socialism or whatever the new thing they want us to be afraid of. Now they believe in it and it sounds good enough. They'll want it. So we got to nip this in the bud and Vietnam, you know, there's a little bit of that. I mean, Vietnam was super complicated depending on who you ask. Most likely it was about heroin, a lot of the whole war. You think lot of it. Yeah. A lot of it was about the heroin trade. Billions, billions and billions and billions of dollars controlling the heroin trade. Really? Yeah. More so then then the spread of this ideology, standards about the heroin trade. My understanding was w yeah, I understood that a little heroin ramped up radically, but there's all sorts of positive aspects to, uh, most of the ideas that they push.

Speaker 4:          02:29:53       Right, right. There's positive aspects of trying to stop terrorism. There's positive aspects of trying to stop radical fundamentalists for taking over parts of the world and radicalizing segments of the population and making these terrorist cells and attacking cities and doing a lot of things that we know really do happen that that's true, but what's also true, it's a hotbed for heroin, so it's a win win. There's a Geraldo Rivera segment on Fox News where Geraldo Rivera was talking to soldiers who were guarding poppy fields and they were explaining that the US soldiers had to guard the fucking heroin because this is how they got these Afghany farmers to cooperate against the radical fundamentalist that were running these religious sex. Watch this shit, put the headphones on fighting the opium trade.

Speaker 6:          02:30:50       Marsha, this town in the middle of Helmand province, a province was the easy part. The hard part now is governing this province. A province as you suggest, that has become addicted to opium in many, many ways. That is the principle of crop that is being grown here. The Taliban land, the farmers, the money, they are indebted to the Taliban. They have to grow the opium now the marines in their success or in a sense of victim of their success. Because now the population is a, you know, they have these OPM fields and we are tolerating it. We are tolerating the cultivation of the OPM because we know that if we were to destroy it now, the population were turned against the marines and it would be a real crazy risks. Let me introduce Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas here at the command, Yardi for Syrup, the third battalion, sixth marines. Uh, really a wonderful group of marines here. Cause this a kid, I knew him that youtube, who's going to be a problem this

Speaker 3:          02:31:44       now stop now because so, but they're getting heavy with heavy handed against copyright. So isolation, this is in spring cause this is this, is this the gray area we were talking to? This was early in the war. I mean this is like what was that from? I want to say that was probably from 2005. Yeah, dude, this is, yeah, this is the gray, right? This is, hey, this is how a country makes its money. There's, it's not just that someone's profiting, there's fucking, they millions for their GDP. Some one is profiting. I do not know where the money's all going, but there are Boone's of dollars involved in heroin. Right? Billions people are buying it all over the world. 90 something percent of it comes from Afghanistan. Do the math, just do the math. We're still there. And Sturgill Simpson wrote a bit about it or wrote a song about it and they played that song on Saturday night live.

Speaker 3:          02:32:43       And I don't even think they knew what the fuck the song was about. Right. I mean he's up there playing a song about the government being involved in the heroin trade. I mean it's, there's, there's something to it. There's some in and you say, oh, it's conspiracy theory. Stop, stop. There really is billions of dollars in heroin being grown in Afghanistan. The production of heroin really did ramp up considerably. The US invasion. Um, is it possible that this is their commerce and country singer goes on, SNL exposes Afghan heroin trade and no one even noticed. That's my boy. But he's in terms of Thompson, but that this is their commerce and the same way like some communities fish this community plants, poppies and they perhaps, what are they doing with all that money? That's the question. I'm more goats or they get it. Whether done Afghany go to diligent.

Speaker 3:          02:33:36       I mean I don't know what they're doing. I don't know. I just can't imagine someone is not getting a cut of this and I can't imagine that there's no, might as well just know mainstream investigative work that's being done to sort of expose this. I don't know. I mean I might be wrong. Maybe these farmers are not making all the money. Maybe the money's all going to drug dealers and we, we let that happen. That'd be fucked up. It'd be cool if it'd be cool if they got it, but like, look, the world is fucked Bro. Like this shit ain't peaches and cream men. It's like every time I see one of these stupid Senate hearings where they're like, did you do some bad things in South America? Like yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       That shit happens when Trudeau was involved in that thing in like a, what is it, La, Libya. You know like when they were bribing. You heard about this, Trudeau from Canada, they're happy. There's this big scandal up there in Canada because he was involved with this company, which is a [inaudible] company that was, that paid like $36 million to bribe the light Libyan government for like some contracts and it's like, well, yeah, that's how shit gets done over there. You bribe the government for contracts and these people in the Canadian government, like, how could he, this is against his policies. It's like, no, no, no. Welcome to the real world that you're operating in the 1% of the world which has these rules. We just made the fuck up of fairness and equality and equity and all this bullshit. It's like the real world is, hey, I'd like to do this.

Speaker 5:          02:35:01       Can I give you some money and we make it happen. The real world is, Hello Geraldo Rivera walking into heroin fields, talking to a general, that's the real fucking world. There's a lot of that. Yeah, I mean it would be nice if everywhere was like America, but I don't know if it, that's what's really fucked up. Right? Like with this Fairphone shit. I don't know if that gets done. I don't know. I don't know if you get an iPhone unless it's getting made by someone who's making $5 a week. I don't know if you do. And if you do get it, how much does it cost? Tons. What is it like $3,000 how much does it cost? How much does an iPhone? Who's going to pay it? Like you, you already struggling. You already got two kids, right? I mean like you bills to pay, like you're going to spend $3,000 when you're already struggling.

Speaker 5:          02:35:49       We're operating from a place where we have some excess. People are trying to make it every day here. Yeah, they don't give it. That's why the election should is so simple to me. Like the Democrats are going to offer money and republics going to offer jobs and you see it happening right now it's like every platform for the Dems on some level is here's some money. Hey, we should look into reparations. Here's some money. Your boy Yang who's on here. How long were you? Just give everybody $1,000 here's some money just giving money, right? Let's break up Facebook and the Dah, Dah, Dah. Well, that's one of the reasons why for hardworking people, the Republicans are so attractive. Even though a lot of people, they fall into a lower income community like that, they're not these rich cats. They would think there would be looking to have like big, big business succeed, but the messages that you roll up your sleeves and you get to work and that you work hard, you don't get a free ride. And they liked that. And that's also one of the reasons why people that are Republicans are more likely to be involved in churches and a lot of church going organizations because that's where their community comes from. And the community support, instead of getting community support from the government, you get community support from local churches as a good point. Yeah. So you have your support, you have your, we all need that man. Yeah. That's something that really is missing with atheists. Yes community and they're miserable. They're, I've never met this happy atheists. It's like they're

Speaker 1:          02:37:15       vegans. It's like, stop convincing me that God has don't, if you believe it, we're good. You don't need to convince me. If you are trying to convince me, it's because you don't believe it. Well, it's not that they don't believe it, it's just that they're vibrant. They're overzealous. Dude. What do people who are overzealous or overcompensating for something, right. A lot of times, what do you overcompensating for with God? Cause you know shit is bigger than you. Cause you fucking look up sometimes and you're looking at the stars and you're like fuck, something's up. I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's God, I don't know. If it's aliens, I don't know what's going on. But you are minuscule. Yeah. And that's hard for people to take man. It's like, well you think that's why they're really into pushing atheism. I think it's cause the religion that they see you so offensively stupid.

Speaker 1:          02:38:05       I mean, look, there was a funny thing that happened the other day where it, Pete Davidson did a joke on SNL, right about the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church demanded an apology, right? We're giving him, yeah, you're the forgiveness people. Why do you need an apology? How bout he made a joke about child molesting and you guys are the number one kid fucking organization in the world. How long can stop worrying about jokes at paying attention to the fact that you basically run a kid fucking organization that also sells Jesus Kff can fucking factory, bro. That's how it is, man. And a lot of ways and but at the same time there's the gray area because they do a lot of fucking good. Yes. They say that a lot of people's lives, they feed a lot of people, right? So it's like they, they give people community that give people a place to connect.

Speaker 1:          02:38:50       Yes. We're in the most connected time in history and where the most fucking disconnected, right? Think about that. We've got a million friends on Facebook and all these other things and people are lonely because we're connected with electronic devices, connect with, we're not connected with life. Right. And, and we're, and we're connected to outcome, right. We're connected to hope. Did this picture I post get enough likes. Yeah. Right. That's where they really fucked people with likes. Once they figured out how to get people like supremely addicted to interactions and exchanges and likes, man, dude, you know, when like, you know, movies in the morning you wake up and he'd smoke a cigarette [inaudible] right? Like that was what the movies we watched coming up. And that was the first thing that the bad ass or something like that did in the movie. Wake up, roll over on to the pack, you know, whatever it will be looking at your phones mentions there's going to be some of that that's going to be what these characters do.

Speaker 1:          02:39:42       Yup. Yup. So it's like, what do you, do you got kids? Do you take, do you say no? How do you, how do you teach your kid? I don't have kids. I don't know. But like I think about this all the time, how do I teach my kid to not put his whole fucking value in the hands of get them involved in sports? Because you learn, you learn reality. Reality. Yeah. You, if you don't get that ball in the net, it does not score. You know? There's no points for effort. Yeah, there's no you don't. It doesn't

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       work that way. You got to learn what real life is and you got to learn that there is, it's feels uncomfortable to fail, but that uncomfortable feeling that you get is fuel and then let your kids fail. Will you let them fall on their face? They fall on the first all the time. My kids do sports. You know, there've been involved in athletics in some form, whether it's martial arts or gymnastics since they were little. They do things that are difficult. We do stuff as a family that are difficult. We do like escape rooms. We play games, we do things that are hard. I don't let them win. Yeah. I mean, my, my little one, I let her win sometimes and stuff like we play carnival games against each other or something like that. I'll let it, carnival games. Yeah. Like go to like a circus circus. Like when I was in Vegas, I was in Vegas for this thing that my daughter was doing. So I took my youngest daughter circus circus playing these carnival games. Okay. How let her beat me a bunch of times.

Speaker 3:          02:41:09       But that's, we're having fun laughing and being silly, talking trash to each other too. Yes. She, high fives means stuff. It's fun. But uh, I think there's value in learning that it sucks to lose because that makes you reassess like what you did that the other person did better and how do I beat them? Yeah. It's like when we're talking about weed, but weed making you nervous and makes you paranoid. Like I like that. What I like is, look, I'm entirely too successful. I like, I like to feel vulnerable. I think there's a lot of good to that. You know, like legitimately I liked that feeling because it makes me, um, it makes me more connected. It makes me more humble. What do you mean you're too successful? Well, you can only have so much success in this life for you start thinking that you're different than other people.

Speaker 3:          02:41:58       You know, it's you thinking that you're something special. No, he, look, if you're on a path, right? If everybody's on a path and you start off here and then x amount of years later your way away, you could start thinking, oh, I'm better than all those motherfuckers. Yeah, but you're not, you're just, you just have been on this path longer and you haven't fallen off of it. You've figured out what you need to do to stay on that path. We know a lot of people that were on the path at one time in their career and then something happened. They lost their enthusiasm or their body wasn't as healthy or whatever the fuck happened and they dropped off. I'm still on that path. Why? Because I figured it out. What does it keep going? Keep going. Don't be a pussy. Keep working. Improve objectively, analyze your performance.

Speaker 3:          02:42:41       Look at what you're doing wrong. Treat everything with respect. Treat all of your endeavors with focus and intensity and intention. Look at what you're doing and pay attention and do the work. Do the Goddamn work. Do the writing, do the performing the, you'll see me, I'll do four or five sets a night in La and I'm doing 1520 minutes, half hour. I'll do an hour here. I'll go down the ice house. We'll do an hour ice house and doing two shows, the Ice House tomorrow night. And I'm, I'm, I go, whoa. I go, well, there's no excuses. I go and now it's like the, to me, the way I've got it set up, it's great. My kids go to bed. By the time my kids are in bed, I leave, you know, I say goodnight night, tuck them in. I'm out the door, I'm headed to the club.

Speaker 3:          02:43:24       I'm home in four hours, you know, and when I'm, when I'm done, I get in front of the computer and I write, I write, I get up in the morning, I see him off to school, go back to sleep or I go to the gym, I get things done, keep moving, got to keep moving. My job is the task. It's like my job is, I'm trying to, like right now it's most exciting time for me, uh, in my career arc, my, uh, my, my comedy arc because my comedy arc is put out a special, it's very exciting when you're putting out a special, but then the most exciting time is, you know, my special came out in October. So then those months afterwards where it's this mad rush to create a new, a new hour and solidifying perspectives and honing material and uncovering new layers and looking at it and reanalyze it and stepping back and listening to a drunk and listening to it's sober and, and, and, and smoking weed and going over it again.

Speaker 3:          02:44:21       And just spending time mashing the keys, spending time, looking at the notes that you can type your stuff, you know? Yeah, yeah. Type. Yeah. Yeah. It's very valuable to be able to type because you can get out your thoughts way quicker than you can writing. Writing makes you remember it better than you remember it better when you write it down physically on paper. So if you look at my notebooks, I, I'm like a maniac. I write the same thing over and over and over again cause I'm just writing down my sets, running down my bits and the key parts of the bits so that I have, I'm solid in my brain, but my writing in terms of like my most prolific creation of things that I never thought of before comes out writing with a keyboard, writing on a computer. But can you write how you speak?

Speaker 3:          02:45:07       Nope, but I don't have to. So it's just how you come up with gems. Gems is here and then you flat say form. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. I was going to write a bit about Geraldo Rivera in the poppy seeds. I would smoke a joint. Right now it's sit down and I would just go Geraldo Rivera with his porn mustache, strolling around these trained killers and Afghanistan wearing his goofy ass fucking tie. I wonder how those dudes, and not as I think of what else to do is think about strutting around puffing his chest out, hanging around. All these guys have been blowing people's brains outs for the last six months protecting America while they're also simultaneously protecting heroin like hey on is that when your boy gets shot protecting a fucking heroin field and it doesn't even make it into the paper. And then I'll just start going and going and going and going and I might type out a few thousand words and then when I go back, I might have two lines or a or a seed. Then I'll take that seed on stage and then I'll to see if I could water

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       that bitch or if it's toxic and I don't know, you know, know how long will you give the toxic? That depends pens on the bits. Some bits are just juicy right out of the box. Some bits, you just start them up and you're like, oh, we got one kid. Yeah. You know, and then it's the ones that like, what about the ones that don't work? But you know, there's something there. Oh, you've seen it. How long will you want pens on? How, how intense it is. Depends on what's there for me. Like, uh, I had this bit about Bruce Jenner. Like what really happened? Like with Bruce Jenner, you know, and I had to try to figure out how do I make fun of this guy becoming a woman? How do I do this? Like, how do I, how do I figure out how to do this?

Speaker 4:          02:46:53       And the way to do it for me was to make fun of myself living with all women because I have a wife and I have three daughters and it's like this little all is feminine energy around me. And like that they didn't diminish my manhood so that I had this like that. I've never been happier. But yeah, I've never been more of a bitch my life. And I had this whole long path. And then it got to, you know, I've never been more of a bitch in my life, but I'm telling you this, I'm not going out like Bruce Jenner. Boom. And the whole thing was people were like, someone's got a fucking sad. I go, everyone's like, oh, he's a woman trapped in a man's body. I'm like, maybe, maybe. Or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough, you fucking, they come off.

Speaker 4:          02:47:34       And then I, then I got into this whole bit about the, the Kardashians becoming like these gargoyles and hovering over his bed and talking to him while he's sleeping. And he's, if I had to figure out a way to do that bit right, it took a long time. Yeah. There's a, I thought that's something I would love people, I would love for people to know I do this. Should I do this show called inside jokes where I just get comics to come and we take our most divisive premises, don't look and we work it out together. And um, and it'd be so cool to do with you, man. We'll do it. I'll definitely do it. Chris rock went through that with his, probably one of his most famous bit. His mom's faint. One of his most famous bits is, I love black people. I hate that bit is one of his most popular all the time bits.

Speaker 4:          02:48:21       He told me he bombed with that for a year. Yeah. A year. Yeah. Said he couldn't, he couldn't get it to work because Chris is a fucking workhorse system. People don't know about Chris Man. Like it's a great story that exposed everything about him. He was filming his special at the Apollo in New York and there was an after party for his own special that he left so that he could go work on that set at the strip. Wow. So that's work. Right. So you got to do, man, the guy didn't become one of the biggest hangups of all time by, it seems like they shouldn't, they shouldn't kept works cabbies out there. It makes you tired. Exhausting. Yeah. Yeah. And I'll get it. You can jog with him. It's like he's like our joke version of the Rock, you know? You know what I'm saying? Like, cause he fucking never, never. It's all private jets, Jetson hitting the gym and fucking concerts in front of 50 million people. It's the same shit man. Like this isn't an accident once would, what an is an accident. They get exposed. The ones that are faking the funk boy. That's the reason why Netflix took out the fucking thumbs up, thumbs down, you know all that shit. Remember when they did like you, cause there was a few of those specials that look this, their special needs that have been on comedy on Hbo.

Speaker 4:          02:49:41       Youtube is interesting because they still have this thumbs up, thumbs down, you know which people do game. But the reality of that thumbs up, thumbs down is you get to see what the fuck people really think. Absolutely. To a certain extent you think, I think it's 100% bullshit at this point it was useful. But now back to your point that you have, you have a whole bit about how many thumbs up and thumbs down. Have you ever clicked on zero? Right. So a certain subset of the population has thumbs up and thumbs down. It's like, well it's like yellow leave comments. Yeah, yeah. Or write reviews for fucking food. I think if you were to magical a bit about that, doe does a good, a good bit of both. I forget wake, I don't want to butcher it, but if something about like someone left like a, like a three out of five review and it's like who the fuck are you like I get if you loved it or you hated it.

Speaker 4:          02:50:32       But to write about this, some people fancy themselves to be like foodies and a journalist, you know, exploring the subtle nuances of cuisine. If you're hungry, it's good. It is. But when you see a guy like Andrew Zimmerman traveling around the world doing that or you see Anthony Bordain or a lot of these people you take, I want to be like Lens for culture though, right? It was like, it was more than just food. It was like, what does this food say about the people? Some of the other guy like, like I mean, I don't know Zimmer, what is it? The weird food guy. First of all, he looks like a salmon and it's just weird to like just fucking stare at this guy. Then like it's just odd when you look at them, right? Yeah. It's just, I don't just make it as way up fish ladders trying to get, he's trying to get all the stream, I suppose the sand.

Speaker 4:          02:51:24       I would say a tuna. Okay. He's got a little tune in him. Hmm. Handsome fellow. Gorgeous. Could be on a bill. Um, anyway. Yeah. I don't know why the fuck they're leaving these things, but it's, you know, they, some people want is they invested so much money in certain things that we're getting down likes and I was like, all right. Like I guess they were doing it with Starz, right? Was it stars with Netflix? Yeah. Yeah. They pulled the star system too bad. I had a lot of motherfucking stars pitch. Yeah. People are going to watch your people are going to watch yours regardless. I think you give them an add value and added value. He said there's certain people that give Netflix the added value and there's certain people that want the value from it. It's also,

Speaker 3:          02:52:05       they're documenting some of the greatest standup specials in the history of stand up. There's like the Chappelle specials, the two recent ones that he did. They're putting that stuff out there and they're, they're doing it in a way where no one else would do it. Like Hbo, which was the gold standard for the longest time. Yeah. They would never do two Dave Chappelle specials at the same time. Netflix is like, okay, we'll do Dave's like, I got this new shit I want to do. I'm going to do it in the belly room at the comedy store. You know, and Dave was so ridiculous about it. Dave and I were downstairs. Yeah. While he was doing this, while he was filming this, we're downstairs, uh, or the in the smoking area of the comic store getting high as fuck. Yeah. And he was so casual about is like, hey man, you want to do it set like you did the bird?

Speaker 3:          02:52:51       No, no, no. I just want to watch. I said, no, no. I did three sets a night. I go, I'm, I'm just going to chill and hang out in the back of the room. But he was so relaxed. Like during his special being taped, he's offering me a guest set. He's like, hey man, I'll do it set. You know, he still shows up. He'll fly to places and show up and just do guests sets. Yeah. I was in Denver. I come out the green room, it's Friday night and Chappelle's there and chapels in the green room and I go there. He goes, hey Joe. I go, what are you doing this? Oh Man. It's felt like coming to Denver. I go, you want to do a set? It's like, oh yeah, fuck it. So I bring him up on stage. The audience is leaving. They're leaving. Can I come back?

Speaker 3:          02:53:29       It's your pals here. They're like, what's, yeah. Yeah. Everybody comes back. He does 40 minutes. It was amazing cause it's, that's how he's doing it. He's like, he's doing it for the art. He's not doing it because he's making any money. He did a free 40 minute show for these people that came there to see me. Yeah. Fucking loves it and loves it. And he hits, it's like true with him, man. He's a perfect example of that. Just being true. He'll show up Monday night at the comedy store in front of 13 people and he'll go on stage. I'll do a half an hour in front of 13 people. Yeah. And he'll drink and he'll smoke cigarettes and we'll talk shit and laugh at his own jokes. And everybody has like one of the most magical experiences as a, as an audience member you could ever have. I was young comic in New York and there was a place called the comedy village, which was the Boston. Do you remember? I remember. Sure. So it became comedy village. When did it become the village? And it's done now, but now it's like a Japanese restaurant. A Japanese restaurant. No. Got It. Jamie. Cutten. No, but, uh, there's a, um, uh, in, in this is

Speaker 2:          02:54:27       young like bark and asking people to come in off the street. And how old were you when you started? A 23, 23. 23. Yeah. And, um, and Chappelle comes in and when he gets on stage, there's probably 13 people in the crowd, right. And the fucking word gets out and you just see people start slowly graphs like goldfish. You know what I mean? When they could send some little or ducks or something like that, when they send some breads coming in the pond and the place was packed within like 20 minutes. Wow. Outside, it was just everybody texting their friend. Oh my God. Chappelle's here, here to do so crazy. And he did six hours, Bro. One real dude. And were there were there were girls like falling asleep or something like maybe four hours, 24 hours, something like that. It was one of these known ones landed it. It was jazz. Right? It wasn't like, it wasn't like I'm doing bits and I'm murdering the whole time. He has this ability to make the audience comfortable intention so that it is not anxiety inducing. Right. What what he can do is talk to you for five minutes straight without a punchline. But as an audience member, you're not going, oh my God is this guy, is this guy not funny

Speaker 3:          02:55:39       when he was, he was doing that for a while and where he wasn't doing scheduled shows, all he was doing was these pop ends. And not only that, but he brought a fucking speaker and set up a microphone in the park in Seattle,

Speaker 2:          02:55:53       outdoor, outdoor. You know he did that early on. Yeah, I was there. I watched it, watched them do it in much New York or not

Speaker 3:          02:56:01       do it in Montreal. We did a set together at club soda and as we got outside we went outside and Dave just said

Speaker 2:          02:56:08       gather round, people gather it. And he started doing stand up to people in the street and they were like, what in the fuck? He was probably like 20 so do you know William Stephenson? Yeah. Comic rest, some shorts and a, he was one of the original like comedy and the park guys doing stand up. Charlie Barnett, Barnett, Barnett and Dave would go with those doubts. Yup. Yup. And like, can you imagine a more hostile environment for stand up the New York City Park, New York City Park. You compete with guys doing fun flips over Swedish tourists and then there's a guy just with jokes hand hanging on is you know, handling his own. It's like, then you put him on a stage with lights and fucking Mike and a see and some cigarettes. Yep, that's, yeah, it's trength training. It's like running with weights on, so how do what the question is how do we do that? Like how do you find that the more successful you get when you have people that are coming to see you no matter what? Where do we get our strength training? Where do we get smoke weed.

Speaker 3:          02:57:09       Paranoid. That's what I'm saying, Bro. I feel vulnerable. That was going to feel scared. Filled nervous a lot. I like it. I really do. I do it all. Like I joke around on stage about how I take edibles when I go to the airport because I like feeling, I want to know what the fuck's really bothering me, but it's really true. I really do do that. I take an edible when I fly. It's just like a freak out because you're too comfortable with this. Weird, yeah. I get something out of that freaking out. Like I'll find out where the holes in my game or I find out where my mental game is lacking, what's really bothering me and then things that freaked me out that I don't like about myself. I've work on them. I fix them. I visit the wizard. You, you got to visit the wizard.

Speaker 2:          02:57:58       I wonder if this comes from having fighting background because the one thing about fighting is if you have a hole in your game, it's exposed in the most brutal way. Right. Everything else in life, you can ignore the holes in your game. Yup. You can just be like, oh, I'm not a bad storyteller any. They were just busy. I concentrate on my strengths. Yeah. Yeah. Boxing or fight, whatever it is. It's just like, I better keep my hand up. Yep.

Speaker 3:          02:58:25       You better patch up those holes, bitch. Maybe that's what it is with standing on. I think that's what it is with me. I'm just, that's my formula. I mean, I don't recommend it to everybody because everybody doesn't have the same personality. Like you might not have those same deficiencies. Like it actually might be psychologically damaging to some people to get as high as I get. You know, like it might fuck with your head too much where you don't come back from it. I come back like a nicer person, but I'm in the same throws of fucking agony that a lot of people are when they get to high. So you're purposely yeah. Fucking your shock and my system. Yeah. A purposely freak myself the fuck out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:59:07       And you don't think you'd be able to create without it? Oh, definitely could, but not as good.

Speaker 3:          02:59:11       I don't know if I can as good, but I know it works. I like doing it. I liked doing it because uh, I always benefit from it. I feel like I come back from those little paranoid journeys. I go a little bit of a better person and I think it's been responsible along with other psychedelics and becoming a father. All those things may be a better person. Maybe a nicer person, maybe more compassionate, more understanding, more friendly. Well, yeah. More understanding is the big one. More. More just I get it. I don't want to be confident all the time. I don't want to always be successful, like, you know what I mean? This is like good people listening right now that like that's all they want, but they haven't experienced the other side of the coin. Yeah. Do you know what I'm saying? But when people get too confident and then they have an audience, right.

Speaker 3:          03:00:00       If you have an audience, that's part of the problem is, and we've all seen this, when comics become really successful, they work to their own crowd and they don't do sets. Yeah. They don't do a set like I'll do it. The store you'll do where there's like 10 people on the line. Right, right, right. Deleah yeah. They might be there to see a fucking Eliza. They might not be there to see me at all. Right. But I want to hit those mother fuckers. I want to hit them hard and they want to go, oh, look at this meathead. You know this fucking champ. Look and dude, what's he going to say? You're like, yeah, you can't be smart and funny. You can't be interesting. Whatever their biases is. I got to figure out a way to sue that over. And the best way to do that is you got to perform and hostile environments occasionally.

Speaker 3:          03:00:40       Yeah. You know that this is all so critical, man. So critical. Have good openers like up killers, kill. Bring murderers with me on the road. Only way to do it. I bring Joey d as in the road with me, man, I brought, brought Joey d as in the road for years. I would tell people they would get white in the face. They'd be like, what? The who opened for you in Dallas? Oh, Diaz did. Joey, do you get nervous? Like what? Joey Diaz in front of 6,000 people, Joey Diaz Open for you and you ain't seen murderer. You Ain't seen Joey Diaz at the Chicago theater for a 3,700 people in the fucking lights are dimming the lights or fucking crushing so hard. People are falling down there. They're in pain and pain. Yeah. You've never seen him live. Ooh, I really wanted to, when I was in la, I set it up Halloween town for, I got to go tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          03:01:31       You'll even a, yeah. Is he around tonight? I'll find out. I would love to. He might be. He might be doing a set at the store tonight. I'll ask him, man. There is. He's the goat and my opinion. Really? Yup. Whoa. I never seen anybody funnier. Whoa. He's, he might not be the best writer. He might not have the most consistently crafted hours, but it terms of the highest highs, that motherfucker breaks through the mag fear and he wiggles out into the outer atmosphere of space. Like no one he hits these highs were like comics, comics work are crying, like holding your stomach crying and he's screaming and yelling and it's like, you ain't seen nothing like it, man. He was onstage. I wrote about, I put it on my Instagram the other day. He crushed so hard and I can't even say what he was talking.

Speaker 3:          03:02:21       He crush is so hard and it was such controversial material. So unapologetic. Good Push. Yeah. And He, at one point in time, people were like, what the fuck? He goes, what do you want from me? I'm almost dead. Because they got to give a fuck. And people were dying. I mean dying. I don't think there's ever been a person. I've seen everybody, dude, I seen everybody from rock to Chappelle, the Louis C, k I watched Sam Kinison when he was alive. I saw bill Hicks when he was alive. I opened up, I'm a follow, I had a follow up prior when he was dying, when it looked for five weeks in a row, but I saw a prior live. I've seen everybody live. I saw Martin Lawrence and he's in his prime. People forget how funny Martin Lawrence was. He was destroyed. I saw him back when he was wearing leather jumpsuits, who'd gone still realize man was leather jumpsuits and smash smash and the struggle on after him.

Speaker 3:          03:03:20       But I never saw anybody like Joey. Joey's on another level. Who is, who's your toughest follow Joey? Without a doubt. Yeah, man. You gotta. You gotta ride that wave. But that's what's good about it is like if you're, if you're funny and you're working on your stuff and you're and you enjoy comedy, you go on stage already laughing, so you go on stage already in a good mood. That's, that's what's up. Like part of the being a tough, tough follow is two things. One, you're used to going on after scrubs and there's a lot of guys that are good comics, but they'd like to bring scrubs in the road with them and then they get settled

Speaker 4:          03:03:58       in in that easy sort of, I'm going to see the show. Exactly. There's a lot of guys that do that, man. They'll take guys on the road with them. They're really or barely professionals and these guys are filling theaters and they're bringing week acts and they forced us audience to sit through a half an hour of bullshit before they go onstage and then there's guys who don't do it like that. They just look, I don't know. I don't know who was doing it that way before I was doing it, but my thought was I like, if a guy makes me nervous when I go on after him, that's going to make me ramp it up like I don't, I don't walk on stage cold. I'm backstage throwing punches and doing jumping jacks. I'm doing breathing exercises. When I come on stage I'm fucking guns blazing and that that's if you go on after Joey Diaz when he hits that crescendo, it better be ready.

Speaker 4:          03:04:52       When you came into the store, I remember I was about to ask you something and you were on the wall and then you just folded in half and touch your toes and I was like, what the fuck is going? I could barely touch my ankles was like, all right, this is ritual. I'm going to let him do his thing. Listen Up. Yeah. I get loose and I figured out that over the over time you can just walk on stage and everything would be fine or you walk on stage with a already you've got some intention. Yeah. I guess sometimes I got to remind myself of certain things to get up there. And the most important thing I learned is reminding myself that this crowd wasn't at the last show. Yeah. Like you sometimes you can take that energy from the early show and we were just bottling it and you're like, oh, I got this.

Speaker 4:          03:05:34       Let's go, let's just walk. They weren't there, so you can't do that. Can't do that. Yeah. You gotta you gotta always, always appreciate the audience's attention span. And that's something that I've really learned from Boston and Boston. It's cold as fuck. The women aren't the prettiest in the world and people are angry and they got to work in the morning. I'd be ready Tuesday night I did this, I did this thing and it never got picked up. And I put it out as part of this like a series. Essentially. It's like I emulated Bourdain's thing. I want to look at a city through the lens of comedy instead of food. Right. And I, the first city I picked was Boston, cause all my favorite comics are from Boston. And I'm like, why the fuck has this city produced so much funny? What does much immigrant people, is that it?

Speaker 4:          03:06:18       Yeah, so it landed there. And what type of funny Patrice O'neal's Michael, right? Yup. So it's like put Patrice, but he's one of the goats for sure. You can go bill Murray one liners Berg late, whatever. Steven, Steven Wright. Conan is from the area. I think we're talking about all different types of comedy. Silvermans I think from New Hampshire or something like that. Right. But like there's something about the region that no matter what style you see, you funny come from here where you're from. An area of what? What was it? Newton. Newton. Boston. You're actually, yeah, so I was talking to in Boston. I knew you started

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       there, but I didn't know if you were from the city or what. He was born in New Jersey, but a, I lived all throughout my high school years and everything. I lived in Boston,

Speaker 2:          03:07:03       so it's like what the, what the fuck is it about? This city was cold as fuck. It's cold. Yeah, but something there. It's too cold. I need to be warming up to like talk to people. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:07:19       It needs to be warm enough for we go outside also, well you know it's a scene. It's like a scene has to be established to, because Boston does not have the scene it used to have in the 80s right. But la has a better scene than ever and scenes are fluid. They come and they go, you know like Denver has a scene and they have a scene because of Wendy who owns the comic con. But there's, there's different places that have scenes and Barry Crimmins and Lenny Clarke and Steve Sweeney and dawn Gavin and all those guys that were part of the Ding Ho in the 1980s and Steve was on my podcast. And those guys created a scene and through that scene, the end, because they were all competing with each other for spots on the tonight show and all these different little venues, they, they created a, a monster dynamic where all these young guys were coming up following these killers. And I was very fortunate to be one of those guys. And that's why I wanted to talk to Steve and tell him that on the show is like I saw that fucking guy, I saw that guy murder murder to the Pullman. No, and nobody was watching in terms of like the national audience, it was just Boston, but he would go on stage at Nick's comedy stop and level the crowd level that like a fucking hydrogen bomb dropped in the middle of the room. Just boom.

Speaker 2:          03:08:33       So you, so you learn what killing is like. I feel like one of the toughest things about the alternative scenes, and I'm not knocking this, they're the comedy, but the litmus test for murdering is different. You know, when I was coming up in New York and I had to follow recipes, Mike Destefano, you know, Greer Barnes guys that maybe are not household names but

Speaker 3:          03:08:54       did Greer's a beast. Greer and I did shows together. We did it colleges together right back on the road. Wave in the 90s.

Speaker 2:          03:09:03       If, um, if you want to know, at least for me, if you want to know what Chappelle is, Chappelle is Tony Woods and Greer, he is a, Tony was another beast, but Tony is unfathomable. But like he's the Gremlin that popped off of both of their backs. Like if you could mold them together, like everything that is amazing about Tony and amazing about Greer.

Speaker 3:          03:09:23       Well, I mean, that's how it is with music. That's how it is with everything. We need each other. You know? That's why when I see a guy like you coming up and I'm like, Ooh, good. Thank you. I'm happy you're around. Um, I like it. I like comedy. If I stopped doing comedy tomorrow, I want more comedy to watch. I love La. I love laughing. Yeah. I like, that's why I tell you I've sit, I sit down and watch Joey Diaz. I fucking love Comma here, you know? And but thinking about Joey is, Joey has new material all the fucking time. You go see Joey

Speaker 4:          03:09:54       now and you see him four months from now, you'll see a whole new set. Yeah. I got to see Joey while I'm out here. He's the best man. I'm telling you. If he's doing his watch him, I'm going to try to see if he's where's? Yeah. You guys have a show? I think so. Maybe I'll go. Maybe I'll run over and see comedy store. What time? Eight o'clock show.
