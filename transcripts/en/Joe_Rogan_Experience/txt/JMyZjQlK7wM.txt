Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       he's alive. All right. We're live, Carlos condit and Irwin the core. Welcome gentlemen. Welcome. Thanks for doing this. Appreciate you. Of course. Thanks for having us. I'm so happy. First of all, for folks who are not aware of the situation, what's going on? Uh, Carlos Professional MMA fighter, one of the best in the world, just fought for the welterweight title. Extremely close fight against Robbie lawler. And you spent a lot of your time this camp. How many camps was it? Were you trained with Irwin to now to now? Yep. And Irwin, you are a movement specialist and this is all the rage in mma right now. It's gets really kind of fascinating as this sport grows and develops. We're looking at a sport that's really only realistically been around since 1993. That's when it sort of form martial arts, of course had been around forever, but as a sport where people really started picking it apart and trying to figure out what's the best way to pursue this. It's really only been since about 1993 when the UFC first started and the most recent trend is guys trying to improve upon balance movement and their ability to close distances and attack and be in a position to constantly be able to do that in between those techniques. So instead of concentrating on just hitting pads or just doing shooting doubles or doing various drills, you're concentrating on the movements that take place in between those techniques. Is that a fair way to describe it?

Speaker 3:          00:01:39       Um, yeah. And, and I think that the movement, uh, also helps, uh, in, in the techniques themselves, you know, we, we can focus specifically

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       play on, on, you know, martial arts technique techniques which are know on a base level movement. Right, right. And how did you guys get hooked up?

Speaker 3:          00:01:58       Uh, I reached out to, to Carlos. Yeah. Actually, it's one of your requirements that you were commenting on one of those UFC events and uh, you, you talked about the current state of the welterweight division and at some point you talked about Carlos and he was still recovering from his injury and, and you said that at this point, uh, you know, he was 31 or four years old back then and uh, it was a serious injury and that from then on it could only somewhat gets slower and that made me react because it was both true and not true. True. From a conventional standpoint, it's true. But from a, a, a training, coaching, a movement practice standpoint, I knew that there was a possibility to, to, uh, to reverse that, to improve, right? And that this is actually a vacuum and that made me think Carlos is right there.

Speaker 3:          00:02:46       I need to reach out to him. I can train him and I can show that there are some different methods that can bring results. Even in a seasoned fighters, uh, like Carlos, what is your background turning in the woods a lot. The window was a kid moving in the woods, climbing trees, jumping from rock to rock and being lonely, being encouraged to do that by my own dad. Um, uh, in the. And then later on I did some extreme trainings I would say in Paris with a very small group and we would climb scaffoldings and uh, we will jump off bridges and we would balance on top of the class scaffoldings like popcorn type stuff. It was, it was a part of the movement because, uh, the founder of par core, David Bill was almost my neighbor and practically we're the same age, but we didn't know each other back then and I was filling in all the guy and we would do these, uh, these trainings because we were somewhat, um, wanted to go against the normalcy that, you know, how heavy the nurse you have normalcy of wanting to do a to know ourselves, uh, through, through movements and exercises and challenges that were complete out of, out of this world.

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       What do you mean by heavy? The inertia of normalcy? What exactly do you mean by that? Well, I'd like to save at normal of silent killer. A lot of people are just extremely bored by their day to day routines and kills them. It shrinks their comfort zone all the time. And um, uh, it rubs their, their, their creativity, their, their vitality, um, because we're not meant to live such predictable lives and, um, we're actually, we're supposed to be extremely adaptable. That mental and physical level and we, we need to train that adaptability by a, presenting ourselves with the challenges that are going to maintain that adaptability. It's, it's we need a strategy. Um, if a lifestyle is boring, if we're born in our lives board, in our lifestyle, uh, there's nothing in this world that's going to really a change that we can entertain ourselves. We can consume tons of entertainment, but what we need truly to get out of this is a strategy, a to a perception of oneself that is different.

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       And then the strategy that's in line with that perception of a strongest self have a more free self. I don't know, it's a very philosophical, but you asked me about it. Um, I'm just telling you, the, the, the West, think about it, if I had followed a, you know, what the box, the textbooks, the, uh, the conventions, I would not be in the place I am today, I would not have done what I've created. So it's a philosophy as much as it's a training modality because everything in life is philosophy, but you call it philosophy, outlook, perspective, opinion, values, whatever you call it, it's something in your mind is a certain perception

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       that makes you see yourself, see the world a certain way and behave accordingly. A bodybuilder, you may, you may think that it's purely physical, but it's not, it's a philosophy. The guy who wants to be big as a perception of himself as being very big and he's getting to train accordingly. So it always starts with the perception and then you behave accordingly. So everything in that sense, his philosophy now when you met this character will apply to all these movement teachers look like Jesus because that's a question that's been coming up over and over again on the forums when I feel obligated to ask. Um, I think there are a lot of the, the, the naturalistic persuasion. So, uh, first first impression of Irwin was that he's very intense. Uh, we went and we know there's a wooded area there in albuquerque and we thought we're going to go play around, you know, walk on some, you know, walk on some blogs and just kick in immediately.

Speaker 4:          00:07:01       It's like, no, we're working. And it was from the first time that we started, he was demanding excellence and, you know, demanding, uh, quite a bit of, of, of, of focus. And for me, you know, I'm kind of like an add type of person and um, you know, I, that's why I fight. There's a lot of different things to do. I can move, I can play, I can focus at certain times, then go fuck around at other times. And, and I'm working with Erwin. It's not only been a beneficial for, for me physically, but also, um, you know, as far as my, my, my, uh, focus and uh, just my, my attention. I'm physically. Initially it was hard, man. I was, I was maybe seven or eight months off my knee surgery. Um, my body was stiff. I had a great physical therapist and we were making progress in, in that respect.

Speaker 4:          00:07:58       But, um, I wasn't there yet. I had a lot of imbalances. I was, it was still kind of fucked up. But, um, what type of knee surgery you had? ACL reconstruction. Did you get cadaver or Patella? I had an allograft or cadaver. I like that. That's my favorite one. I encourage people to do that. I know the guys have said that it doesn't take, but when guys say it doesn't take, I always wonder if they were training too hard, too quick. So, um, I have a good friend who's a, a, a, a orthopedic surgeon, and he, he told me that it's strong initially because they use somebody, a Achilles tendon, which is four times thicker than your actual 50 percent stronger than a regular acl. But as your body's assimilating it, uh, it gets weaker. It apparently your body does this scaffolding of its own cells around it as it's assimilating it to your own tissue and it, it gets weaker during that point.

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       Eventually you wait a year, 18 months, it's going to be stronger than it was before. But even that period, seven, eight months where you're feeling good, um, the inflammation's gone away, the swelling has gone down. You're like, oh, I feel, I feel amazing. I can go fucking train, I can go spar. Boom. You blow it. Yeah. And they say it didn't take. But that's not really true, right? I don't, I don't think it's true. That wasn't my experience. I've thankfully, from what I've talked to doctors, they, that's exactly how they said it too, that you feel really good and you start training hard. Then you blow it out at Herman did that, Dominick Cruz did that. A bunch of guys have done that and it's, um, it's very common. Yeah. So, uh, you know, Erwin and I started working together initially. It's, man, I couldn't do hardly any of this stuff and I'm a high level athlete and it was frustrating.

Speaker 4:          00:09:45       So, um, I would go and I didn't put a little bit of information from him, I'd work a little bit by myself and then the next time we worked at I had, I would have made some progress and um, we'd worked together for, you know, once a week, maybe twice a week for over a year now. And now how, how are your camp structured? Because a lot of people, they structure the camps are very regimented. They have the particular days for strength and conditioning and it's all sort of design so that they have enough time to recover for their skill work and especially if you're working in that specific techniques for a specific type of fighter and you would have to incorporate all these things and then this movement training and stuff as well. Like how would you figure out when to put that in? Did you have to experiment or every camp really isn't experiment because as I've grown as an athlete, I've changed as I've got older, you know, I have to take more time off than I did before.

Speaker 4:          00:10:41       I have to really, you know, pay, pay attention to my body. So we do have somewhat of a structure like that, but it's also every, every, all the scheduling is tentative. It's like, okay, yeah, I have this scheduled on this day, but if I'm feeling like shit, I'm not going to go in there and do that. That's, that's a good way to get hurt. It's a big fight. I can't, I can't get fucked up. So when you feel like real worn out, you have to sort of like really be paying attention to your body? Yeah, absolutely. Um, and we do active recovery. My strength conditioning, the place that I, that I go, um, we do a lot of different things. They use some biofeedback, a dove, a software that is pretty cool. You stick some fucking sticky pads on your body and like ekg thing and it can actually tell you physiologically what your readiness level is.

Speaker 4:          00:11:33       And this is being used by a ton of different. I'm a professional athlete or professional teams. I'm a collegiate teams and professional teams and Olympians. So the checking, like muscle balance, a lactic acid? No, this, I would, it would, it does, is it measures heart rate variability. And a central nervous system activity and the correlation between the two and whatever their algorithm is that they come up with to figure out, you know, the, you know, what, what the correlation means. They can, you know, you got a little dumb screen that shows you blue, blue or green, yellow, red as far as your trainability I can, you know, I can do strength and speed. Uh, but my, my power and strength, you know, a level readiness is, is down. And then so we, we use that as a tool. There's sometimes you just got to go. Sometimes you've got to go old school and be like, you know, yeah, you know, this is, this is fancy but I need to push through the um, but it's, it's a tool to help mitigate overtraining.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       Wow. That's, that's really fascinating. So it seems like experience is probably the most important thing then. I think so. I think so. And that's hard though. When I'm in training camp, I'm like a race horse man, I want to fucking run and I really need somebody to pull back the reigns. And sometimes I can do that myself. But sometimes I'm in fucking, you know, in shark frenzy mode, I just go, go, go, go, go. And uh, you know, and, and, you know, I have, I have to have people around me to be like, Hey, no, whoa, ticket to you to kick back. And your relationship with Irwin, when you guys first started with how did you work in the movement training with all the other stuff that you were doing? Did you have like a specific day you'd say, Hey, we're going to meet on Tuesday and.

Speaker 4:          00:13:23       Yeah, pretty much who's Day aside? Pretty much, yeah, we would go, uh, you know, block out maybe three or four hours later in the week, um, and, you know, just hit it and it wasn't always intense. That was a cool thing about working with Irwin. It wasn't like physically intense. It was um, uh, mentally and neurologically taxing. So after we did this stuff, I was absolutely wiped out, but, you know, I got my heart rate up a little bit, but these weren't hard work as they weren't taking anatomy physically. That's interesting. So what was, what wiped you out about it? Um, I think it was, we're training the neuromuscular system and we're training the, um, he could probably tell you more about it than I than I can, but, um, it was, you know, really, really precise, uh, uh, movements that just tax tax tax you neurologically. And I'm like, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       Well, first of, for so, uh, Carlos is surrounded by a war, a team of world class people, a person who was talking about Adrian have elevate I, albuquerque is a strength and conditioning coach. So he works specifically with him on this area, this trending. And then there is Brendan Gibson and then there's and Dale and of course there is Greg Jackson and when controlling. So, um, so me, I had to, uh, to address areas of training that I believe the, where we're lacking a. If I was to find a word to describe what we've been training with him, I would say, uh, Carlos would have been training your brain because the number one reason why we have a brain from an evolutionary perspective is for movement. It's not to discuss fine wine or the history of art, which is great. But originally it's so about a year old can navigate, uh, through complex movement, through complex environments.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       That's the reason why we have a brain, uh, so intensity is not necessarily a raising the heart rate, you know, going real hard and burning all over. Intensity can be in the mindfulness that you apply to, uh, intentionally perform movement very specifically with a high level of efficiency that requires a level of focus that a challenges stimulates and help the, the, the connective, uh, functions grope as a matter of fact, movement itself is a major, if not the major, uh, a secret or, or, or, or reason for, uh, helping conductive functions. It does a whole deal of, of, uh, things, uh, in the, in, you know, processes in the brain that's going to, uh, to, to, to help it grow and what you acquire through movement transfers to any area of life. But obviously transfers to better movement and better movement is not always just more power, more uh, or new techniques.

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       I told Carlos, Carlos, listen, you've been 20 for 13 years. Your extremely seasoned, extremely experienced. And I bet that a, you've tried a diverse modalities of training, uh, but that currently you are a, every camp is pretty much the same in term of preparation except what's specific to a game plane for a given opponent. So I said you might try to acquire more, more power. It's gonna take a lot of energy because you have already a lot of, of, of power for your while you're awake degree, uh, you may try to acquire more endurance, uh, but that's gonna be putting a lot of time, a lot of energy to get that. You can try to learn more techniques. But do you have a hurry? Know already. So many techniques. So one of the things that you can do is to, to move better. So any technique that you already know, we wanted to perform them better.

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       Okay. So what is involved in movement training? So let's say it's day one, you get a guy like, uh, and he says, Hey, uh, uh, I love this idea that hooked me up. Well, uh, in the case of Carlos, it had to be something specific to him as a fighter to what I saw. I saw, you know, what are his fortes is strong points, but also saw what I believed were deficiencies. Uh, and that may seem presumptuous, but when I talked to him about it, what I saw that could be improved, he said, well, that's exactly what I've been told for years by my coaches. And what was that a thought that he's, his stance was too high. He used these two narrow slowly these particular, you know, uh, typically Thai boxing square stance, uh, you know, with his feet and the l shape, um, and um, and to me that caused a ton of instabilities, but also preventing him from being as fast as I believe he could be in moving in and out or, or sideways.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       So what adjustments did you make as far as the stance? We, we, we move the position of his back foot is orientated, you know, at a 90 degree angle. So we moved it forward more at a 45 degree angle. But the problem when we did that, when we have a square stance, basically your feet are in line, so if you move you are relatively stable only because the foot is going that way that when you move it that way you, you shrink a bit, your, your base of support, it creates even more instability. So what you need to do is to have your feet wider to widen, you know, a bit wider on the, on the, the front or to the back and then to the sites like something like, uh, uh, with a shoulder width or her hip width. So that was really a lot of when you, when I was tweaking something, it will, it may create an, a negative consequence that we had to do a lot of drilling to, to improve that stance, to make it, to make, to make it better.

Speaker 3:          00:19:47       Now the stance that you developed a sort of classics dance, you know, and you're a tall guy, you would fight and stand up high. Were there any issues when he started adjusting the way you place your feet? Or did you have to relearn things and. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, without a doubt. Um, I've been, I've been training, you know, uh, we tired since I was 15 years old and so yeah, I mean these things have been, uh, you know, have been a stratified in my, in my fricking my muscle memory for, for years. Uh, so yeah, it took quite a bit of, and I probably, you still see me going back to my old habits. You're going to, especially when you're tired or you're stressed or you're in different situations, you are going to revert back to the thing that you've trained the most. But when I'm mindful of it for the most part, um, you know, I, I definitely think that the improvements or the, the, the adjustments we made were, uh, were major improvements. Um, we also worked on, instead of being real, real heavy on my front leg, having more

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       of like an upright stance and upright stance as far as my torso and not, uh, not being so heavy be more 50 slash 50 on my legs and that, that allowed me to move in and out faster. Not only forward but, but back. Um, and that showed big time in the fighting is Tiago Elvis. I think that was the reason I was able to get in, get inside land with the elbows as effectively as I did and you know, and then kind of, you know, get, get the fight rolling. We're seeing some, I love watching different sort of patterns that are developing the fighter start following. But one of the things that we're seeing, there's a lot of people that are standing and more of a karate stance, more sideways and wider stance and that with that, like sort of Leo Machida style a gunner, Nelson likes to fight like that. You can bounce conor Mcgregor, you bounce in and out easier. It seems like a, a lighter foot print sort of stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:21:44       Damn. Yeah. And that's very much what we were aiming at. You know, I executed the way that I do because I'm a flat footed kind of fucking goofy guy. And I do, I do my best, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm lucky I got a hard head sometimes because I'm not Mr technique all the time. Um, but we definitely made an improvement. I must say that working with Carlos and uh, he's uh, he's extremely focused actually when one trend there wasn't like no, it was like a zero fat kind of training, like completely, entirely focused from the beginning to the end. Always really applied himself during the training and I know that he drilled a lot also on these own, in between every session to make those adjustments to make them become second nature because when you, when you change any aspect of your technique, at first it feels unnatural because your brain is, you know, you have something, a certain patterns that are ingrained in your, a neuromuscular memory and they are, there are a little hard to change.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       But Carlos was able to change things really fast actually. And I was always impressed about how fast he would make those progresses. And again, those progress is, were not up that much physical and you know, in the sense of strength and conditioning, like it would have to work hard to. It it, the, the changes were always told him, you have the body has it. What you need is that that map being newer in your brain somewhere to really understand, recognize, identify and assimilate fully vet particular pattern. You've done so many movements, so many, so much footwork, so much, but the way to do it requires a different wiring between the mind and the body, between the brain and the body.

Speaker 5:          00:23:42       That's a big part of it, right? Is just patterns. Getting those patterns

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       ingrained in your system to the point where they come out automatically, like you know, those, those movements that happen either inspiring or in competition where all of a sudden you're executing something and you had zero thought. It's just completely. Your training takes over. You slip upon and counter and you don't even. There's no conscious thought at all and that has to sort of similarly be achieved through movement.

Speaker 4:          00:24:12       Exactly in that, what's, that's what stimulated Carla's brain that much that he had to take a nap after every training. Whereas he's used to reread hard trenton. But with that training, which is relatively low intensity and uh, the brand is so stimulated that he needs to recover because it needs to process while it is, it's like if the movement, the mindful movement is the input that the body that the brain needs to do that read circuiting a differently, um, and to, uh, to deconstruct old patterns, replace them with newer, more efficient butter. And that didn't happen while we were doing it. You know, while we were doing a lot of the times I was struggling with this stuff. Um, but I'd go home and I would rest and I'd go back to my room, my regular training work a little bit on and not a whole lot.

Speaker 4:          00:25:08       But then the next time I would come back it was almost as if my, my, my mind and my body had digested this stuff and assimilated and it put it into practical application without like a unconsciously without me even really working on it too much. Um, you know, he says that I, that I would work in in the meantime between our sessions. Sometimes I did. Sometimes I didn't. Sometimes I had a lot of their stuff, sometimes you do that, um, but it looked like I did, um, because I feel like, and I, I think this is kind of a consensus that you make gains, you know, during your rest you can lift and lift and lift and lift, but if you never rest, you're never going to make those gains. The same thing with, um, with your technique and um, you know, this, this, this neurological training, I think it's, it works the exact same way

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       that is the whole movement that's going on right now is really fascinating because there's a bunch of different sort of branches of it. Um, and there's like what ido portal is doing is what you're doing, but there's also a curse on is doing. He's the guy who's just trying to get action coach for Fabry Silverdome and heartfelt dos Anjos. And I had him on the podcast and I asked him like, what is like one of the most important things that fighters are lacking and that you try to improve on? And he said foot strength. And I found that to be really interesting and when I watched what you guys were doing, a lot of this barefoot jumping and leaping and balancing and it requires some pretty

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       extreme foot stability is the number one thing we addressed with car number one and number one, I said your feet are not strong and they're not, they're not smart enough, not that that, that fee to have a brain, but there is a, uh, an extremely strong correlation between the proprioception in the foot and the brain and movement. So most of the time when we move, we're on our feet and that's the reason why there are so many sensors, a nerve terminations in the feet, thousands and thousands of them. Why? Because it's about intelligence intelligence in the sense of information. We talk about proprioception, extra reception, which is the particular perception of a, a given surface and to dixter and he's asleep or reuse. It does, it gives them traction and things like that. Uh, is it, is it stable or shaky anyways? So the moment you place your feet, a boom sends information to the brain, the brain processes, and gives order to all the rest of the body to shift the way to, to, uh, just, you know, give some order, some intention, it happens without you having to think about it and it happens extremely fast.

Speaker 3:          00:27:56       However, the more you feed are sensitive in that sense, the faster information travels up and back down. Uh, and secondly also the stronger of foot is the more reliable your base of support is. So we talk about the strength of the foot. We talk about the elasticity of the muscles in the feet, uh, to, to be sometimes more bouncy, just simply faster, uh, to be also a more endurance to last longer with elasticy and speed. Um, and we did a lot of that through a balancing drills even like loaded balancing drills, but also specific footwork drills and moving in and out in. And it was not only a, the footwork itself, it's also how the level of alertness that you have in relation to an open net and the level of responsiveness that you have in your movement in relation to open it because it's not just reinforcing a particular part of your body as if you're made of parts it, it has to work as a whole.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       We had to make sure that anything would improve specifically then would be brought back to the, the whole spectrum, which is movement in a fight and work and actually improve. And that's what Carlos did every time when you would go sparring and then he would see by himself and then telling me back, I've improved. These have improved that in my coach's seat too. So the proof is in the pudding as, as Carlos would always say it works. You know, most people would think that if you're a fit guy and you're a strong guy and you know, I'd say maybe you do squats or something like that, you'd have strong. And

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       one of the things that shocked me the most when I started doing yoga is, that's what would give out. It's my feet would give out. I was like, this is so bizarre. Like I felt like, okay, if I could stand on one foot, like if you made me stand here on one foot with my sneakers on, it's not hard. They'll stand on one foot. Okay, no big deal. But when you're balancing my feet would fucking ache, you know, like you're doing like bow pose or something like that and you've got one leg up here and your arm is stretched forward. And you were balancing my feet would be what was giving out. And I started thinking about how little stability, you know, most people probably have from training with shoes on, lifting weights, with shoes on, doing, running with big thick cushy shoes.

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       Even even elite elite athletes and even our elite MMA fighters. And the reason why, even even when they are training barefoot in Dojo or in teams. Um, but you have to think of what's the background of a given person. Most people today in modern populations grow up indoors. We have shoes on all the time. We're walking, we're walking on flat. Smooth surfaces are predictable. There's no challenge to, to the body. There's no challenge to the feet. The feet become numb, feet become weak structurally. And uh, and, and, and, and in term of strength in term of it, just sorta get a tissue. Yeah. So, um, if you try and MMA because you are getting to, uh, do uh, you know, say, so striking move on your feet is going to help, definitely is going to help your, your food scraps, your foot mobility or stability, but not as much as what you're going to gain when you have to balance, uh, uh, on, on narrow surfaces and ordinance certain positions in certain transitions and kneeling and sitting and get up and get down. And especially we've loads on or at a certain pace, at a certain speed. It's different. And when you make the feet stronger than your footwork is stronger. When we talk about movement coaching, uh, some people are confused because when they hear movement in relation to fighting the footwork and it is work, but it's also more than that.

Speaker 2:          00:32:00       Do you remember a few years back, uh, it was all the rage you, you're hearing about a lot of nfl players were doing ballet. Do you remember this? It was a big deal. Like people will like mocking it, joking around about it. And I remember thinking, man, that is really interesting. Very smart. They must have some sort of benefit in that if they're doing it. But if you think about ballet, the movements are incredibly difficult and especially if you're a 260 pound fucking stud athlete covered in muscles. It's like if you're a thing, like there was a guy that was in a yoga class where he leaves his former football player, real big guys like six, four and real thick and heavy and it's so much harder for him to do these movements and say like a girl who weighs 100 pounds,

Speaker 3:          00:32:46       it's like a castle in the sand inaccurately standard. It's like an Achilles food. It's a, you have a whole mountain that's, that's built on on the very weak foundations and ballet of even for nfl players was actually a very smart move because when you look at the strength of the, the, the cows, I had a cousin who was a professional, a denser, uh, her, her cows or bootstrap was completely amazing because, you know, they do these gracious movement. People see the grace, but they make extraordinarily movement look easy, but they're not

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       like floor gymnast too, I would imagine because they have to stick your, your foot has to have the ability to catch you and then just stay in that position completely locked.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       Then you absorb of foot, ankle, knee, hip stability, core stability. I mean, it, it, all, it starts, starts in the foot. I'm balanced. I mean it's, everything is integrated of course. Um, but it, it starts to feet.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       I saw you doing some of the countdown shows. You were doing a lot of jumping over things, standing and jumping onto a board and landing on like, it looks like a two by four or something like that. And locking in place on that. And it was pretty impressive stuff because there it is right here, Jamie, how you're on the ball, but like this kind of stuff, like when you were doing these kinds of movements, like, look, you'd see it here on this. How did you, how do you design these Erewhon and like what are you looking for different things specific to Carlos

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       hundred percent specific to Carlos because that's the point. A movement coaching for lack of better term. Um, it's not giving a fighter random movements that are not fighting movements, [inaudible], Bollywood, dancing or whatever for a tight. She couldn't be anything. It could be any movement. Movement is such a very. It's a vast world or universe. If you're lucky, you're gonna, you're gonna. If you'd give something randomly, you're going to find something that happens to be useful. But in, in the case of Carlos, I looked at his fights and analyze these movement. I had some, some, some intuitions about what was there, what was missing. And then Isaiah was draining him. I was constantly adjusting the movement programs. What was in every session to what I saw was working, what was not working. What I, depending on the level of progress that it wasn't making, we would do something more difficult or are the higher level of intensity. It's, it's tailored, it's customized, not random. How did you develop this program? This

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       is very interesting because I would imagine that you would get athletes from a bunch of different sports that would come to you, right? No, no. I'm not looking. I told Carlos, Carlos, listen, I'm focusing harper sent on you, right? There is no other athlete that I want to travel like a gym. Right? I mean you have this move. Nat Is this company of this website? Yeah. We have a, we have thousands of certified trainers who are using our methods, thousands of trainers. I think somewhere around $3,000 to run the wellness world. The company since 2009. So this is all your creation. You've developed this all yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       My method, the method is my creation, but however I do draw from, uh, from the history of physical education, which I have studied a lot, especially what comes from Europe and in my case because I'm originally from France, uh, they used to be a method called a natural method by a guy called Georgia bear who himself was not. He was seen as a pioneer, but he himself was, you know, at some point of that long line of people before him was a morrows and pistol lindsay and mercury. A lot of guys who were working on these different methods, but we're talking a, a 20th century, 19th century, 18th century, and before and before, and before, and back then people didn't have exercise science. So what is it that they were training. They were training the most down to earth, practical movements. They would jump, they would run, they would crawl, they will lift and carry things and throw and catch things. Why? Because these are the movements that people needed back then that they were in the military or firefighters. And when you look at it today, if there's a situation that say potentially life threatening, these are still the movements that you need to do to save your life or to save somebody else's life. They're extremely, they're natural, but they're natural also to the point that they are vital.

Speaker 2:          00:37:49       So you have this gym, right? Um, what, what is your normal clientele? Like? The normal person that comes to a move net, Jim,

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       it's impossible to a shrink to a particular category because

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       do you get like housewives? You get athletes of all sports? Yes. Yes. All than young men and women. Woman comes in, she's an, she's a housewife. Women hate that fucking expression. A woman comes in who's a non professional athlete who's just looking to get back in shape maybe after having a baby. Like what? Do you design a protocol specifically for her? Is that what you would do? Yeah, it's a lot of classes, like the movements, there are some movements

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       that are a fundamental movements that anybody can do a. and then you have more advanced movement and then you have say a simple jump. You see Carlos jumping, like this woman you're talking about won't be able to do that. Yes, you will, but not at the same level of intensity. Right? Oh, I see. So you would have her do it alleged shorter jumps over lower jump on the spot where he jumped two inches above ground and lend in the same spot where you were standing to inches. I think she could do for. Have you got a pusher? Yeah, exactly. Well it just needs to keep the training. Got It. You know, never too hard, too easy. That was actually also my concern when I started to try and Carlos because he was recovering and I was extremely worried that I wouldn't do anything that would compromise these recovery in any way that would actually help him recover even even faster.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       So a method, you have a method, only one. It's scalable and also when it is progressive and because these movements are natural, they belong to all of us. Like it's like, um, what would be the best way to train a wild tiger? Like, can you imagine that you're going to try to isolate their, you know, their hang legs and then try to have them do another workout for the front legs and then put them on the, on the, uh, treadmill for cardio. But I wouldn't make any sense. That would be hilarious because to be optimally strong and that Joel and like a good hunter, a good Predator, the well tiger just needs to be and behave and move like a wall tiger in its original environment. But could it be any different? Tiger on an inverted treadmill and really pushed that motherfucker some good music on maybe some motivational videos, heater up a drug, a drug go tiger.

Speaker 3:          00:40:26       Uh, well, you know, they do that with, with pit bulls. Pit Bulls. When they train them for fighting, they put them on treadmills. It's a, they put them on a, a treadmill that sort of self propelled the animals propelling the treadmill and they'll put something in front of it that it wants to get to. So exercise science for four pit bulls. Yeah. Well it's a, it's a real thing. I mean they sell these. Yeah, they wanted, they have weigh ins, a serious moment. Why not? But my point was everybody needs the fundamental of, I believe everybody needs the fundamental of, of movements before you go through a very specific science based exercise for, for anybody. Uh, most people don't need that. Most people just need to move in the first place. There's only men move. It can't even squat. Most people are just sedentary. They're just sitting on offices and cubicles or what happened, the cause of most of their, uh, physical ailments is that improper movement behavior, lack of movement, or to specialize movement and the lack of diversity and the good things that, the antidote for that is movement. Also movement behaviors, movement behavior is the cause and the solution to a lot of physical issues. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:46       When you think about it, what do we do? We fucking stand. We sit, we lay, we bend. That's about it. That's like four, four things right throughout our day, you know, and that, that is so, so narrow of a movement spectrum compared to what should we do. We should throw, we should run, we should catch, we could, should swim. We should bounce, we should pull, we should carry, we should fight, we could all, all this a variety of things that the human body is supposed to do. And yet we are like in these constraints of our, you know, we have chairs, we're sitting here on fucking chairs for, there was chairs or fucking, you know, a low, low squat or kneel or, you know, um, there's a, there's also the, the, the neurological benefit of doing those things because to, for you to, um, to, to move that way your body has, or your brain has to do it for you. Be Fire those stamps. We're not, we're not doing that by, you know, this, this boring as shit you or, or even if we're a fit, you know, we're still laying. We're still, we were sitting on machines. I'm doing, uh, you know, uh, elevated, you know, whatever. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:43:01       or something. Yeah, it's, it's, we're still kind of isolated and very minimal. Very minimal. We were not supposed to be like that. We're supposed to fucking move. Exactly the, the, the, even the people who who are brave enough to go against the inertia of normalcy, um, and go to the gym and they will exercise with machines. I see a huge problem with that type machines because machines dictates your movement, shrinks. It, shapes it. Uh, you have no choice. You follow a very simplified pattern that's imposed by the machine, right? This is not who you are. This is not what she's supposed to be and move like, yeah, because you're supposed to be highly adaptable in the way you move. But when you do try to isolate your muscles, you're treating yourself like you're fricking machine. It's like a factory when you should be like a wild forest or permaculture garden or something like that. It's not what you're designed by evolution or creation, whatever to do.

Speaker 4:          00:44:13       And so bringing it back around to mma, it, stepping in the octagon to, to fighting, you know, the nature of our sport has so many different variables. I mean, anything can happen. We go through, you know, we're using various energy systems. We go from, you know, going a Arabic to anaerobic to using an isometric hold all the way back through, you know, so, so many different things involved because basically we're able to do whatever the fuck we want it with, uh, you know, under a very limited amount of rules. So training this way just just makes sense. Um, because it's, it's, it's much more a along the lines of what we're actually going to do in competition. How much of a factor is flexibility play and how often do you train flexibility.

Speaker 3:          00:45:06       A lot of, a lot of, so flexibility's is, is huge. Mobility is huge because the more mobility and you can explore, manifest physically have full range of motion, but it's also plays a huge role in how relaxed you are and therefore how much power you can generate. And that's actually what was the, uh, one of the main point of focus on the second camp that we did for the fight for robey. Um, so we established a strategy I proposed as a movement strategy to Carlos and he, he, he, he, he, when he talked to Greg Jackson about his game plane, they, they came up with the same thing and that was to use his ranch to always keep control of the ranch and therefore two's, he's, he's reached through using these kicks more and better and um, we had to address some, some deficiencies in flexibility because what we, what we, what we noticed right away is that when you was a, when Carlos was trying to reach a certain height, uh, he had to somewhat go a little beyond these, his bag then current level of immune height. Yes. Yes. And so when you try to somewhat forced solidity or mobility, what creates instability and, and, and slows down the movement and then you also lose this occurs in power and accuracy. So we did tons of, of stretching, but we did that stretching through natural movements through all lot of movement on the ground and, and um, yeah, for those natural patterns.

Speaker 4:          00:46:47       So I think, uh, and you know, tell me if you agree in MMA as opposed to traditional martial arts. I think we skip over a lot of the intricacies because I know you're a martial artist, you're, you know, you're, you came up in taekwondo and I feel like traditional martial arts really emphasized, you don't go past this point until you've mastered this, this thing. And it's very a very specialized in mma. I think we get a guy and he's got a wrestling background. Uh, we'll teach him a little bit of boxing. Um, we won't get him necessarily super crisp, teach them how to stab a few submissions, you know, get him real strong, get them in shape and then put them out there and let him go with intensity. And a lot of times that'll carry a lot of guys to the top levels and yet they've missed some of these smaller, um, basic nuts and bolts kind of thing with, with the movement.

Speaker 4:          00:47:49       And I think that going back to I'm in that, that's all good. That's all well and good. I, you know, you need, you need that mix of stuff. You need the intensity, you need to be able to get out there and bring in by down on your mouthpiece and throw down when it, when, when the time comes, but if you have that, you can always go back and work on that other stuff. That's what I feel like I did quite a bit with, uh, with Irwin is, you know, I'm making these tweaks on these, uh, these very fundamental things that had been, had been skipped over because, you know, I'm Kinda, I'm built. I got, I got the fighter thing here and you put me against whoever I'm to, I'm going to fucking go, but now let's refine, refine, less refined and, and maximize and maximize the potential of what I can do.

Speaker 2:          00:48:40       Yeah. It seems like almost having that kind of go go, go mentality, that fighter mentality. It's obviously a huge benefit when you're in a fight, but it almost seems like maybe sometimes it's against your benefit when you're training because when you're training you almost should be looking at it like a science do. You almost should be looking at, instead of like just trying to be the toughest guy in the room, you should almost be looking at it like you're building a castle and you have to make sure the foundation is good and in traditional martial arts you have your white belt techniques and then you know as you develop in the ranks and you get new new belts, you move up and you get a higher ranks. One of the things you say you get a higher techniques are more difficult techniques, but one of the things you see in mma is there's guys that have mastered, like truly mastered one particular aspect of MMA.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       Like Damien Maia is perfect example. These are legitimate jujitsu master world champion and because of that his, his specialty is so strong that he, when he gets to that spot, he just got this massive advantage over almost anybody. And you see that when he fights like really good guys. You know like Gunnar Nelson. Nelson's a motherfucker, a motherfucker on the ground yet, but Damien so goddamn good like neil magnets and other one neil magnet is so good. He's so tough and so, so good at avoiding submissions is defense is excellent and Damien just ran right through them and he runs right through him because his technique is Samurai's sword sharp and he has polished it down and then now he's learned all the other stuff. He's learned kickboxing and in the beginning you didn't have that and that's why like nate marquardt knocked him out or all these other guys were, were able to beat him. He just didn't have those, the standup skills. He didn't have all the other attributes of, of MMA, but that one thing he had honed to like sort of a mastery level, whereas some guys never get to that in anything. They're really good at everything, but they never get to a mastery level in anything.

Speaker 4:          00:50:41       Yeah. Yeah. And I would, I mean, I would say that that's probably me. I'm, I'm good at a lot of different things. Um, maybe not a master at necessarily anything stand up is pretty high level. Pretty high level. Yeah. You know, you stand up pretty much anybody, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       I, I put your standup at a very high level, but you know, your submissions are very good too, man, but if you spent five years it did nothing but you Jitsu every day and started competing in the Monday aisles and Abu Dhabi and Naga and all that shit and who knows what the fuck your Jujitsu it'd be like,

Speaker 4:          00:51:18       which sounds awesome. I mean, yeah, when I was coming up, Greg Jackson's gym now is very much a, you know, seen as kind of kickboxing strike lots and lots of striking some, some, uh, some wrestling, some Jiu Jitsu, but mainly striking. Right back in the day when I first started with Greg and his, his system and his affiliates, it was mainly a grappling school. It was guided Jitsu, right? Oh, Jitsu, yes sir. Created. Yeah. Um, well him and some other guys kind of got together and created this thing. Does he still call it that or is that. No, no, it's, that's history, man. That's just, that's old school stuff. I don't know how the fuck I still remember that. Um, but you know, a guy like Keith Jardine, who by the time he got into the UFC was kickbox and everybody, when I first met Keith, Keith was a Jujitsu Guy, man. He was competing and in the advanced level at these, uh, uh, grapplers quest tournaments and that sort of thing. And then kind of got away from that. Um, and you know, I think my first 12 or 12 or 13 wins or something, we're, we're by submission and now I haven't had a submission in years. Yeah. So I'm just got away from that and I think the sport kind of evolves and then it comes full circle, like it goes one way and then, and then the other and you see that with, with

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       fighters as well. Like Paul felder's, perfect example, kids is excellent striker and he had couple really close decision losses to Barboza and Ross Pearson. And then he wins his next fight by submission and attacked with another submission before he got the rear naked choke. You almost got him in a gay teen. Like you see guys going, hey, there's other ways to skin a cat. Like I gotta I gotta figure out how to be more predictable or unpredictable rather. And I think that that's one of the real problems with guys who were specialists strikers, is that when you fight a guy who's a specialist striker, you know that he's not going to be shooting on you. So you're more relaxed, you know, you can loosen your legs up a little bit. You know, your footwork, your stance takes a different position because you're not, you're not squared off always looking to sprawl, hit under hugs.

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       Yeah, absolutely. And you know, you bring that up in. That makes me think about my last fight. You know, I'm, I'm a well rounded fighter, but I said I went in there and had a kickboxing fight with Robbie. Um, well I thought that would actually be to your benefit because what I said in the pre fight thing was that you, you issues you've had in the past with guys who have been able to hold onto you and grab you down like Hendrix and that, that might be a benefit to you in the Robbie lawler fight because fucking Robbie, just, he's a gladiator. I mean that dude, he is so rare in that regard. He what you see is what you get that guy, you know, he is all bike down the mouthpiece and move forward and he's got excellent technique and he's. She's fucking tough as nails, but he's a born fighter.

Speaker 5:          00:54:12       Born funds. Well, that's why that fight was so good between you guys that last round, man. Jesus Christ. When the fucking round was over and you guys both put your arms on the cage. You. That was the. That was the perfect example of leaving it all in the octagon. Yeah. You guys just emptied out the tank. You were on fumes and then the Buzzer rang and you both did the same thing. When the fuck is that ever happened? I don't think that's ever happened in a fight with the fights over and both guys just walk to the cage. He didn't hug each other like that fucking happened. Later. I can look at this. Look at this picture right there. That's you guys. That's fucking never happened man. I've never seen that. I wasn't conscious of that at that point. I think I was on oxygen deprived. Hypoxic, yeah, probably mildly concussed. Taking shots. That was a fucking amazing fight. It was an amazing fight and it was an amazing round. That fifth round was just goddamn chaos mean. That to me is all of the scariest aspects of mma as far as damage and you know, what you guys are doing to each other and all the greatest aspects of mma as far as like display of heart and courage and willpower and just determination because you had to be burning. I mean everything. What was it like in there? That fifth round?

Speaker 5:          00:55:30       I came out and I was, I was feeling good. I think I came out and finishing that fourth round I finished strong. Almost almost had him finished. Um, in that fifth round I knew that he was going to come out like, you know, like a bat out of hell. So I wanted to finish strong. And you never know what the, what the judge. I didn't know where I was. I felt like I was maybe up on the scorecards, but I'm like, fuck it, I need to go out there. And I started the round really, really strong I think, and then he woke up and you know, came on, turned on is beast mode, like he does at the end of a lot of fights and you know, had, had led into some really heavy strikes. Um, but it was, I mean we were just digging. I don't even remember. Honestly, I don't.

Speaker 5:          00:56:11       I remember at certain points, I guess the only thing that I could compare it to was like being in the ocean and having waves crashing on you and you're just getting your head above water just to get enough breath and then boom, you're getting another one crashing down upon you and you are out of breath. You're fucking struggling for survival and you know, and you're just doing your best to fucking, you know, to, to come up a moment like that in a fight like that has got to be something that fuels you in a way that nothing else can when you're in the gym. Because you know that those moments can happen. Like when you're thinking about slowing down and a strength and conditioning program or when you're doing rounds in the bag and you're thinking about slowing down that moments, like thinking about that fight.

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       I mean, that has got to be. Yeah. Yeah. That's something tangible you fucking grab onto when you're hitting those, those, those points. You're hitting your, your, your edge and you don't know if you can go any farther than that sort of thing that can bring you through. You know, there's the debate in mma. Like what is the most important aspect of training? Is it strength and conditioning? Is it skill training? How do you, how do you quantify that when it comes to a fight camp? And uh, one of the things that nickerson was saying when I talked to him about it, it's like he believes that one of fighter comes to him or when a fighter is preparing for a fight, they already have all these skills. They already know how to fight. They already know how to kickbox here. And I already know Jujitsu when it comes down to what a camp is, he believes that the primary focus should be on physical preparation.

Speaker 5:          00:57:51       The primary focus should be on getting your body to be able to perform at an extremely high output for a long time or recover quickly. And if you can get there that the benefits of that are greater than the benefits of just consistently working on skill training and drilling and all these other things. Um, I think there has to be a balance because you can be in phenomenal fucking shape, ready to go five rounds and then step out and get knocked the fuck out. Yeah. So, and, or you could, you could freeze up. So I think the, the, the, the mental aspect of it, the psychological aspect is super, super important drill, anything like that. Do you, do you have a mental coach or do you have a visualization drills or anything along those lines? I visualize, I do, but um, and I've done this quite a bit, you know, I, a coach I work with ricky lundell talks about bringing it to the moment, you know, it's, it's about being a game day player.

Speaker 5:          00:58:46       I love ricky by the way. He's awesome. Absolutely. Great grappler a super smart guy and just cool as hell. Yeah. Yeah. I just love that guy. Good all around dude for sure. But I'm being a game day player, you know, you get a lot of these guys in the gym, they're killers, world beaters, but then you know, the bell rings that are under the bright lights and they just, they wilt and the doubts and then come haunting home. Yeah. Well you get and then you get. These other guys are like, really? He's, he's fighting in the UFC. You're seeing training. You're like, Oh man, I don't know. I don't know how well this, I don't know if I want to watch this. He's a nice guy. You're going to get worked. And then he goes out there and you know, and, and does work. It rises to the occasion and have accomplished as something that, you know, maybe you maybe not even.

Speaker 5:          00:59:30       He realized that he could do. Yeah. It's, it's an interesting thing to try to figure out where the balance, where the focus should be. And I think it's different for everybody, man. It's different for everybody. There's no, there's no one answer. That's the thing about martial arts, like I've heard some, I heard this guy talking about this one, so it's not an art, you know, that it's just people beating each other up and I'm like, wow, that is such an ignorant thing to say because when you watch someone fight, you are watching art. It's just violent. It's a violent art. When I watch like your fight with Tiago Elvis, you can't tell me that was an art. That was an artistic performance, like your interpretation of the movements in the moment to step in and blast that elbow. That's, that's, that's a beautiful thing. I mean it's not beautiful to him or anybody who cares about him or his facial structure or.

Speaker 5:          01:00:23       Yes, that's its beauty. There's beauty in that. There's beauty in that. And, and you know, this, but when he did that to Matt Hughes and when he hit Matt Hughes, that flying knee, there's beauty in martial arts there, there is, it's a well for, for me, it, it always has been a creative outlet. I can put together all these sequences and all these different things and in a way to solve a particular problem while something, somebody else is trying to do the same thing against me. And the margin for error is really fucking thin. You know, if I, if I zig when I should have zagged kitchen, a shin upside my head and um, you know, there's going to be bone exposed and um, you know, that's why this is a great thing as well. That's why I'm amazed. So fucking cool. It's so fucking cool to watch.

Speaker 5:          01:01:09       But the, the preparation for one night, like the idea that you're, especially for a guy like you who came off of a knee surgery, you're out for a year and then you have to hold out for more than a year for the geography. Right. And how long was it? Probably a 16 months. So you have all this time building up to this one moment. How difficult is it to just to just be in the moment when that happens and not be overwhelmed by the fact that so much of your future is riding on this. You're not entirely set for life financially yet. You know, there's all these different variables. You have a wife, you have a child, you have a family of obligations, you have all these things, but yet here you are preparing for this one completely. Just, it's like, it just slips through your fingers this moment. This moment is just there that you cannot, you can't hold down and you're, you're sharing this moment with another trained killer and you're just locked into a cage and you

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       future rides on your success. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       Um, I like to say that, you know, fight day, know that that night could be the best night of your life or the, or the worst and you don't know fucking which one. And there's an incredible mix of emotions. And I feel, I feel happy. I feel sad. I feel fucking nervous. I feel, um, uh, you know, elated to be, to be there and then fucking scared as shit and I don't want to do this anymore and I really just have to ride it out and be in, in trust, in my training, trust, in the preparation that I've done up to that point. Um, because me and my mind and my emotions do all sorts of things, but I just have to know that I've done what I need to do in preparation for this fight that I'm going to be all right and that no matter what, I know that I will never give anything less than 100 percent than my best.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       I will never give anything less than, you know, what you saw in that fight. I may get knocked out, but, or, or, you know, it may, may be an early night for me. It may be a terrible night, but that's out of my control. I, I gave everything that I could to each, each round, each training session, uh, each, each minute of, of, of the training camps. So that, um, when I, when I step out there, I've done everything in my control to fucking win this fight and to compete to the best of my ability. Um, there's also the things that are out of your control. You can't worry about that shit. Injuries like injuries, Tyron Woodley, fight or kitchen, that one that you don't see. Yeah. No. And, and you know, shit happens, but that's Kinda the, that's the, uh, that's the thrill of it. Does that make the highlights sweeter knowing that those, those, you know, the bad moments are out there that they're possible? Oh yeah, definitely. I, it's like I said, we're walking on a razor's razor's edge on this thing. I mean, it could, it could be a phenomenal night. It could be terrible night, man. Fuck, I don't know. Nobody's died in MMA at this point, but not in the UFC and the UFC, but it shit could happen. This is a tough thing. What are your, what's your feelings on weight cutting? Like if you, if you could be assured that

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       way. Cutting. We'd be out of the picture. Like let's just throw all the weight classes out and then let's just say like, what are you, what do you walk around like one 85, one 90, something like that between [inaudible] 91 95. If you could be assured that that is just, that's what your opponent's going away and that's what you're going to wait. You don't have to cut any weight, would wouldn't you think that that would be a better way to compete, to just completely eliminate that from the equation. Just find out whatever is your natural healthy weight and competed that instead of this insane thing that everyone's doing where they're dehydrating themselves a massive percentage of your body weight, sometimes as much as 10 percent of your body weight, which is getting sucked away in water to the point where you could literally only exist in that state for a short period of time.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       Couple of hours. Yeah. That's fucking bananas that that's a part of cage fighting that one day. To me, I feel like the athletic commissions are sleeping on a potential time bomb. They're just ignoring that this is a huge issue. While they're concentrating on steroids and epo and all these other things which are real issues, those things are unquestionably real issues, but just as big of an issue is massive dehydration 24 hours before a cage fight, especially now that they've eliminated the ivy rehydration methods and the fact that we know now there's medical science has proven that the brain does not rehydrate as fast as the rest of the tissue. It takes longer. It takes as much as 70 hours or 70 hours too, which is fucking crazy. Or

Speaker 5:          01:06:25       the yeah. To rehydrate your brain. Um, yeah. I, I think it'd be interesting to see different proposals. I know that one fc is doing something well, they've eliminated it there. They, yeah. What are they gonna check your hydration levels. They're going to eliminate weight cutting. Yeah. Well I know that they're doing the hydration levels on like a collegiate and high school wrestling, um, you know, a level. And I still, I still know guys that are trying to game that system. Yeah. We'll let him try to game that system. Yeah. But if you can eliminate that and tasked hydration levels and like, imagine like a guy like Johnny Hendricks who never made it to the fight with Tyron Woodley because the weight cutting, imagine them getting to a point where they check them. They go, hey man, you're fucking dehydrated. You can't fight. Yeah. Like you, you didn't make weight like you, you're not where you're supposed to be.

Speaker 5:          01:07:18       Yeah. I'm on the side of health for fighters and these guys taking care of themselves. You know, we're doing this for a very brief period of time in our lives and you know, the repercussions longterm from a lot of. The lot of the different stuff involve including weight cutting. Uh, you know, this is gonna have longterm ramifications. So for internal organs, specifically kidneys, right? Yeah. And I think it ages you man, it, especially if you're not doing it correctly, especially if you're not living a healthy lifestyle year round, all of a sudden, boom, I'm going to change the way that I eat so drastically that my body's go freak the fuck out. Which you see a lot of these guys and then they don't make it to the, they don't make it to the way because their system isn't used to eating like this. Most of you know, eating a bunch of bullshit and now all of a sudden eating Greens, which is good for you, but your body's still going to have this, this, this reaction to it.

Speaker 5:          01:08:14       Yeah. And when you're not used to it. Uh, so yeah, I would, I would definitely like to see some change. Um, you know, if it benefits the health of fighters, I'm all for it. I don't think it could possibly not benefit them. I think that would be the biggest thing that we could do. Even more so than I think what the, what Jeff Novitsky and the UFC is trying to do with eliminating performance enhancing drugs is awesome. I love the fact that catching people. I can't believe that they caught ul. Romero. Who would've thought that that guy was taking steroids. That's crazy. Who would have thought that? That's amazing. Couple of those guys, man. I would've never believed it. Him or Hector Lombard was another one who saw that common. That's nuts. Vito Belfort, are you kidding me? Nuts. Cyborg. Really? Wow. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. I think that, uh, it's, it's awesome because, um, I mean we're, we're going to come to a point in time in the real near future where it's impossible.

Speaker 5:          01:09:12       Cheat. I mean, they're pretty close to it now. They're pretty close to it now where they are so good at catching people, but they're, they're also saving urine, which I think is fascinating. See Urine and blood for eight years, so to test in case they don't have a test that detects whatever it is you're testing at this point where we can test you down the down the way. Exactly. And you can come up, which is cool. They're super close to being able to catch you doing anything now. But what they're doing is they're coming up with all these little designer things and peptides and that's what you'll all were got caught for some designer peptide which artificially increases your body's own production of testosterone, you know? So they're doing all this sneaky weird shit that used to be totally undetectable, you know, five, six years ago or what have you.

Speaker 5:          01:09:59       Yeah. Well at that, I think that's what they'd been doing for a long time. Correct. Like they, it's been like an arms race between the dopers and antidote with. That's what I understand with the Lance Armstrong who was like a clear thing, man. They were like some super sophisticated fucking programs to beat these tests. Yeah. And with Lance Armstrong, one of the interesting things was everybody was dirty. I mean it's not like mma where you have, there's a few guys that uh, Novitsky, I think he calls it the smell test or the look test while you look at them and you go, who the fuck's going on over there? Right. You know. But with Armstrong, like none of those guys looked like your marrow. They were just little skinny guys on bikes. It's the nature of the sport. And I think what they were probably what they were taking is different than what fucking, you know, big muscled up a prize.

Speaker 5:          01:10:57       Fighters are taking. Well, another important distinction about these bands and about the banning of Ivy Rehydration is now you can't blood dope because they used to be able to blood dope. He used to be able to pretty, pretty easy to just take your blood out and then reinserted into your body. You have more blood and you get the same sort of benefits that you would get with epo. So you can't do that anymore because they'll, they'll be able to detect. They can actually detect plastics in the blood that come from the bags and from the tubes. It's fucking nuts. It's wild. Yeah, it's nuts. It's fucking crazy what they can do. I've heard, I've heard though, like in, you know, we're talking about the arms race that people can use a glass syringe class and then um, the van, like a sterilized veins from animals as their, as their tubing.

Speaker 5:          01:11:51       That's, that's whatever. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's so crazy. Yeah. Like sausage casing and shit. Oh my God. That's fucking. Now they're going to check for big veins down the rabbit hole with all that stuff. That's. Well, Novitsky was telling me that they've now figured out a way to develop testosterone from animals and it's a semi theoretical at this point where they don't, they haven't caught anybody who's done it yet, and then maybe one of the reasons why they're, you know, they're holding onto this blood for eight years, but he said they've figured out a way because right now I don't understand the process, but right now the way they develop artificial testosterone is through wild yams. They use Mexican yams. I fucking don't understand it, but somehow through yams they can develop testosterone. Those are manly, manly Yam. I've always said again what I am.

Speaker 5:          01:12:48       That's why pop pop, I knew he was ahead of the time. They make me feel manly. So they've figured out a way through these carbon isotope tests to detect that the testosterone in your body was nonindigenous, that it was exogenous. It's somehow or another from something else, but they won't be able to do this right now, at least with animal testosterone, which is so fucking bizarre. It will always be a race between the cheaters and those who control those. Uh, with the French Tour de France secretly symbolism, a biking and a back in the early 20th century there were doing it already. And then today, every Sunday there is some competition somewhere like a local short distance drafting and those, you know, Sunday athletes and they dope. Yeah. They're saying that like they check executives that want to like show off our taking epo and entering in triathlons and winning them can put that on their resume. May Jack to the tits on EPO, which is really fucking dangerous apparently. I don't understand he epo, but the way it's been described to me was that when you have so much extra blood in your system, there's a high risk of stroke and that you have to mitigate the amount of EPO and the amount of blood in your system by constantly exercising.

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       Like you have to exercise. You have to drink water and exercise. Otherwise your blood gets too thick. As we talk, millions of people are doing crazy things in their day to day life that are going to mess up with their brain, mess up with their whole physiology, hormonal balance and stuff like that, and they're not getting paid to do it. They just do it out of whatever ignorance or laziness or a. So why wouldn't these professional athletes of some of them, especially in combat sports. Yeah, yeah. I mean there's one thing running. Winning a bike race is one thing, but not getting kicked in the head or being able to kick the guy in the head because you have that extra juice of energy. You know when you're tired and you're in that fifth round, but you come out because you're on epo and you're fucking dominick Cruz, step in and throw in high kicks and the other dude is gasping for air.

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       That's, that's where it becomes a huge issue. Absolutely. I mean we're talking, you know, potentially light. Sure. Well, the way I describe MMA is it's high level problem solving with dire physical consequences and that's. And we've seen it, we've all seen guys get flatlined. We've all seen people, I mean, you've done it to a bunch of guys inside the octagon and it could have been you, you know, I mean, it's a fucking nutty sport and in this sport the doping has just a much higher level of consequences or ramifications, ramifications, right word. What's interesting to me though, I'm absolutely anti-doping, but I'm pro the science involved in it because what we're experiencing right now, what I believe is that we are in a period of time in human history where our understanding of the scientific understanding of the body and its mechanisms and all of the things that they can do to it is being sort of deciphered and tweaked and poked by all these various scientists.

Speaker 2:          01:16:01       Although I believe that should be outside of competitive athletics. We're going to get to a point in who knows, 10, 20, 30 years where they're going to be able to genetically reengineer human beings. And this is all going to be out the window. I think we're kind of experiencing the last years of natural competition, gene doping stuff. It's going to happen. I mean, they have this new thing that they've, uh, they, they've figured out how to do or they, because of this really interesting science, it's called Crispr is what they've developed and there's, I'll butcher it if I try to give you the scientific definition of it, but they can literally add genes and, and manipulate genes and they're doing so in small animals and you know, small, multicellular organisms and they're, they're getting it to a point where they really understand it and they're saying that in China they're starting to do this with human beings and they're starting to fuck with it and test it and you know, you might see some Chinese Wolverine in the next 20 years and you'll know that that kid is the product of these Chinese experiments.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       You know, I mean, that's what they used to call corella these to call Corella and the experiment because if you've ever seen Carolyn's family, his mother and father like five foot six, they're like these tiny people. And Carolyn was this fucking monster of a wrestler. You know, if you, do you know who we're talking about? Alexander Karelin, undefeated wrestler. I mean, he lost one time to rule on gardener, but the only reason we lost is they changed a rule. They changed the rule that this is Greco, so crazy. Whereas if you release your grip, if someone gets you to release your grip, it's a point which is insane and that's how gardener beat him. Like he couldn't do anything to him, but he got corella and towards the end of his career, you know what I mean? He'd been wrestled forever, but he would. He was so scary that guys would try to flatten out to keep from getting thrown by him because he was so strong that he would take these men 280 pound man and he would just go under them while their belly down, flattened out on the mat, just praying.

Speaker 2:          01:18:09       They don't get taken for a ride and he would lift them up and throw them through the air with all his weight and their way. Boom. Coming down on them. So he's essentially knocking them the fuck out with the mat where everybody else was wrestling. He was wrestling as well, but he was also hitting you with the world, you know, it was crazy and no one knows how he got so fucking big in history of sports. There are always these, these freak of nature, these complete exceptional athlete in, in a given, in a given sport with what you say and the manipulations that are going to be able to do on, on physiology may be using nanotechnologies or indeed a genetic modifications. They might be able to replicate to clone those, those freaks of, of science. Oh, they're going to work. It doesn't happen in our lifetimes.

Speaker 2:          01:19:03       It will happen in our children's lifetimes. It's going to happen. Science doesn't stop. I mean it's. If you go just go back 40, 50 years. What they were able to do, if you had a knee surgery, you know, like you're talking about your knee graft, they were fucked. You're fucked. You're crippled. Bumpkiny. Yeah. That's just 50 years ago. That's. That's inside of a living person's lifetime. 20, 25 years ago or less. They weren't able to do this one that I had successful. Yes. My friend Steve Graham was on the US ski team and he's had some fucking insane number of surgeries. I, I want to say he's around 18 knee surgeries. He said he has his knees, kept like, I'll, I'll show you this real. You fucking freaked out. He has his knees resurfaced. The tops of his knees are, um, it's all steel. It's fucking bizarre, man. It's so, it's so freaky to look at. But he came around, uh, when they were doing all these experimental surgeries, they just, they just couldn't. They didn't know how to do it. They just were taking all these risks. And here it is right here. I'm gonna show you this. This is fucking freaky.

Speaker 6:          01:20:10       That's the surface of the inside of his knee. So he has no more cartilage and all the meniscus has gone as well. So if you see that white thing down there, that's artificial meniscus, that's like a pad that they put in place. So they put this artificial paths in place. Then they have the tops of the knee, the top of the femur and that glides on the Plastic Lusaka abstract painting. It's fucking chaos. Like dinner? Yeah. I told him to send me this after you get your latest operation because he's had so many operations. He was so true down to the wire that this is, this is the latest sort of fix. That's wild man. It's fucking crazy. And she's had multiple acl surgeries on both legs, MCL. It's just the whole deal. Meniscus scopes and this. And that is nothing left. They predicted that so many years ago when I was a kid.

Speaker 6:          01:21:09       Uh, Steve Austin, whatever the name was, man, it was fascinating by them. Yeah, we're, we're close to that. I mean they're putting artificial hips in people and having them being more, no more durable than the natural hips. Yep. They're so using a exoskeletons. Yes. Especially in Japan. They're really big on all these robotics. I got it. Got An exoskeleton finding beautiful, uh, for people who really need it. You had a very serious accident and there's nothing can do, but it's now your responsibility or you come back from war and need that, that kind of assistance. In that case, I believe it's beautiful. Yes. But my, my concern is that these kinds of new technology is going to be vulnerable to millions of people who basically don't give a crap about their body. Their body has become completely alien to themselves and the neglect it and let it deteriorate.

Speaker 6:          01:22:04       You could think about it that way or you could say, you know what man? It's just technology. It's. It can be used or abused. I mean like cars. I mean cars can be used to get places or you could be a fat fuck and they just will you over to your car. You lose your way into the car and they push you in and shut the door. Then the car drives you around because it's too fucking lazy. The balance in there. I think in our society, we always go too far. That exoskeleton for your body becomes what the shoe is to your foot. And I think that your, your, that, your, your, your foot is going to atrophy. Your body's going to atrophy because you have. Your foot has this artificial art. But from birth, like in wally, you know, I love that move you.

Speaker 6:          01:22:50       And the thing is that, yeah, it's freedom, it's inevitable freedom. You do whatever you want to completely agree with that. But ultimately it becomes the norm. It becomes something that's not shocking anymore in the wally world, uh, the movie in the end, not being able to even stand, let alone to walk. Isn't that shocking? It's, it's the norm. It's just something normal. My grandma was able to walk a little, a few steps. Oh Wow. She was extremely fit. Know that we ultimately, through generations we change the norm. And so bear all won't be. We won't be there. Yeah. But somewhat. I like to know where we're going in a good direction, how the direction not to. I don't know. I don't know if it is, it's definitely crazy. I don't know if it is a bad direction, but if we went back to a single celled organism and I go look at these posters with their multiple cells back when I was a fucking kid, you had to have one cell or happy.

Speaker 6:          01:23:47       So I don't think, I don't think it's good or bad. I think it's how, how it's applied. Yes. You know, and, and is it beneficial, is it right? Is it detrimental and what, what is the implication on a societal level on like an overall thing? We can look at tech technology, you know, the technology in general in, in that respect. Um, I like to see that as a, as a, an, as options, as additional benefits to our current society. And culture means that let's imagine topia like a society where every individual would be, would consider their own health and movement ability, eyes somewhat personal, biological duty. So there would really make sure that they stay strong. They stay healthy, they can move, they're there, they're in shape, they're sharp physically and mentally and on top of that, whenever needed, they would punctually and wisely use those technologies.

Speaker 6:          01:24:47       Then that will be an enhanced lifestyle and society. But when you have people, it, it's just there to support people who have voluntarily disempowered and themselves degenerate it themselves. I, I don't, I don't like the direction that would be. Are we basing that on the current paradigm though? If we keep moving in the same direction, it's entirely possible that you're not going to need to be in shape or get in shape. You're just gonna be in shape. You're going to have something that they've invented, whether it's some sort of a biotechnology or what have you, where you never get out of shape. You're always physically fit. Your body regenerates tissue. If you lose an arm, it grows back. No, it doesn't mean because here's the problem. You won't be the master of a technology. Somebody else will the same way. It's like if you ever stop growing their food, so when you're hungry, you need that food to be delivered to you to be produced for you.

Speaker 6:          01:25:44       If at some point the production of food is in the hands of very little, very few people, there is no freedom anymore. Okay, so you said. Yeah, but it allows you to be always strong, always fit, always held the. Yeah, but the technology is in the hands of the few people and when they want a ticket back. That sounds like some Illuminati type, but it's. It's, it's, it's, it's that you don't have to go into a conspiracy theory to think about, do you, are you in control? Is it something that you can fix yourself, like a, when you have a car or a boat or something, can you fix the technology yourself? Does it belong to you, do control it or not? I think you're talking about things in practical sense in a practical sense, and I agree with you in a practical sort of a pragmatic approach.

Speaker 6:          01:26:33       I'm extrapolating a hundred years from now when it all it's nonsense because I'm saying there's going to be come a time in the future where there are no natural athletes because there's no natural. People were probably just a few years away from being symbiotically connected to electronics. We're pretty close now with phones. Will you leave the house without your phone? You freak out. [inaudible] met very few people live without a car. You know you have your navigation system to get you around. I don't really remember like three or four phone numbers now. When I was a kid, I remembered everybody's number. I can be able to call my friends. I been able to call my house, I barely know my own home number now when I give someone my cell phone number after think, you know, have to think about that number. So you'll get both. You do give up some of your control.

Speaker 6:          01:27:18       You didn't Google you get, you get all sorts of good shit as well. I think drew and the bad shit that comes with it. Um, so you know what, 50 years ago they started or maybe longer, I don't know, they started making a fucking process foods and that was like the best thing ever. Oh my God, we don't have to fuck it, cook our food anymore, throw it, you know, have it made for us in a factory and we just throw it in the oven and it's done. Boom. This is the greatest thing ever. You know, fast forward 30, 40 years and now we're fat and unhealthy and you know, in our trans fats are national grop for, for our healthcare is fucking, you know, or our healthcare cost exceeds our fucking gross domestic product for the fucking United States. If it were just, you know there's.

Speaker 6:          01:28:09       There's good parts of it. Yeah, they made. They probably made food safer in a sense. Less people are dying from fucking listeria outbreaks and that sort of thing, but on the flip side of that, now we're really fucking sick and fat. One hundred percent agree with you Carlos, because it's not like you could say, wait, that's. We won't be very one with this will happen. There will be some adverse consequences to the whole this, to all of these, but we won't see it. It's already here. It's already altering people's life today as we speak, that people are listening to us. Maybe you know suffering from this and that they don't even the why. Well maybe you're surrounded by thousands and thousands of chemicals in older hygiene products that you know, that you breathe that go through your pores that go in your system, that after your home, a homeless sizes and stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          01:28:59       Maybe you're eating GMO. Maybe it's everything is altered in your day to day life and you see it as something normal means you don't see it basically, and as an it doesn't bother you. You're not conscious of it, but it does bother you and how well you live. Well and and ultimately somebody is profiting right then. That's the thing is with, with any of this stuff, I mean it will become the norm if somebody is profiting off. Sure they can sell it to you. If they can, if they can convince you that this is better, whether it is or whether it's not, but you know, through whatever, they're already selling water to us. Maybe they'll sell air to us or are they in some places provide canned air in China. Let me think. They buy canned air with the little mask on it. You suck the candidate.

Speaker 6:          01:29:46       I've done that. India and Japan. Air Made My. Made my veins. Blue was wild. Yeah. Why? Yeah, because you had so much pure oxygen. You could get it at like seven slash 11 over there next to the weird squid hot dogs. I did a an oxygen bar wants in Vegas. They remember they used to have those still around. I think they do. You put like a little pipe up your nose and I'm supposed to be like, what am I supposed to be getting out of this? Yeah. It's like one of those oxygen things you see old smokers will roll around with. Yeah, totally. And the thing goes up your nose. These little tubes go up your nose and we're sitting there going, okay, what am I supposed to feel? A sense of euphoria of extra energy, and the cute chick that works there comes up and rubs your back.

Speaker 6:          01:30:29       That's that weird thing on your scalp and you kind of shit. I thought good, but it wouldn't come to come to a mind to do something like that. If you were in the mountain and the air is pure surrounded by trees. Why? Why on earth would you try to put some whatever oxygen in your in your brain, you don't need it? Well, that's one of the things that I love about forests and trees that you can physically feel the difference in the air because trees literally absorb carbon dioxide and express oxygen. They produce oxygen. You breathe it in. It feels. My point is that you need these enhancements when you're already living within an environment that is a tremendously deteriorate, completely altered. Then you're like, oh my God, I need their air and more natural food. I need to try to make my even my, my, my house a bit more complex.

Speaker 6:          01:31:20       It stimulates my movement and things like that. That's because you were already out of a universally, I would say universally natural environment comprising not just where you are, but what you eat, how you breathe, the light, and even your home. You own behaviors, how much you sleep, how you think. All of that is behavior and environment that will impact you positively or not in term of how. How will you look, how well you perform, how you feel. It all matters. All these variables matter. What? When? What is your diet like when you're training? Do you have someone who monitors that stuff? Do you have a dietician that you work with or anything?

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       So I worked with, uh, with my dolce for this last camp, this last cut. Um, I met Mike when I was with my knee was, was, was hurting. I was in recovery for that. Um, it was doing some seminars. He was going and doing these talks at some military bases on diet and nutrition, holistic living and um, they brought me out, you know, as the special guest or whatever. And I, and I, you know, I spoke on a too, but, uh, our, our philosophies on, on food and nutrition clicked. I mean they were, there pretty much aligned. We have a little bit different approaches. Um, I started learning about nutrition from a strict, excuse me, the strength and conditioning coach when I was about 19 years old up to that point. It was, it was, you know, whatever. I fucking eaten off the dollar value meal at Wendy's.

Speaker 4:          01:32:52       Really? Yeah. Yeah. During the time you're like fighting the WEC or. No, this was before then. This was, I was fighting in like little little casinos out in the middle of the desert in New Mexico and like making $200 for a fight if you're lucky at a 400 person venue. Um, and yeah, so it was like, oh, if I only eat half of this four piece nuggets, I'm definitely gonna make wait tomorrow. Yeah. And you know, yeah. I vividly remember those days. Anyway, I got with this guy and he just kind of taught me the basics, you know, basically taught me, taught me about macronutrients and he mainly a train bodybuilders but gave me some basics. And then since since that point I've, you know, uh, through my own practice, through my own practical applications of running through these training camps, running through, um, the, these weight cuts and, and absorbing information, going out there and looking at information myself, um, have kind of figured it out on pretty much on my own.

Speaker 4:          01:33:53       And uh, I cook, I fuckin love to cook. That's my, my hobby. And so that helps out because, you know, I'm, I'm cooking at for fun, like kind of as a, as a Cathartic thing after I'm training, but it, it works well because I'm cooking the nutrient dense food that I need to perform and to train and to make weight and to be a high level athlete. I saw that you and Irwin, we're working on bowhunting exercises. Do you do, do bowhunting? Uh, yes. I, I started, started bowhunting three years ago. I have yet to fucking kill anything. I am not, I'm very much a novice. But uh, you know, I'm learning. And uh, is anybody teaching you A. Yeah, I've gone with some guys, um, some, some older guys that are my dad's age. My Dad's not an outdoorsman at all. Um, you know, he likes to fish but you know, he doesn't go farther than about 20 feet away from his car to fish. So this, all this stuff, or one, if you could back that up a bit, please, Jamie, to that bow hunting thing that you just

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       show, showed what is exactly is involved in these bowhunting exercises that you've got them doing. So that was in between the two camps that we did together and uh, uh, Carlos already knew he was going to fight Robbie lawler. She left, but it was a somewhere or just just fucking around Baltimore and yeah. Yeah, it was somewhere a late September if I remember. Well. And um, New Mexico is the best spot to hunt elk next to Colorado, New Mexico and Colorado. These spots in this country, you. Mexico is the best place to live. Really? Think. Well, no. Listen, listen, let's keep it a secret. But what, why do you say that? Um, Diego Sanchez lives there.

Speaker 6:          01:35:46       Yes. The beauty, the landscapes. But, but again, it's the people will prefer another place, but, but there's a certain energy, you know, some places resonate with you more than others. Me, ah, I moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, never, never left. And then find a Jessica, the, you know, my soul mate and up and everything is beautiful there. And will your cheeses, it's a perfect place to live in Santa Fe. A lot of hippies. You got a scarf on even though you're indoors. I'm European, I can afford it. Whatever, you know. I'm French. So when you said to that guy, fuck you. Oh, so what you love? You Love New Mexico, New Mexico. I'm a, I'm a new Mexican now. I can feel it, you know, like they say a born here on my life, but definitely don't sound like, you know, I have a profound love for these land there where I live.

Speaker 6:          01:36:48       It's surrounded by 19 Pueblos on native Indian energy, which I really relate to. And um, oh. So you can go and see these ancient sites where they used to live. You can, you can, they still live there? And some of them right? Like in the mountains, the mountains, the. Yeah. Well the, yeah. There's lots of emotions kind of old school, like, like a stone age apartment buildings. And they didn't, they have cable and now they have cable. Yeah, yeah. Well, they got, yeah, they got satellites hanging off the side of him now and yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. Dad, if you ever come out to New Mexico, I'll take you by Akamai. I'm going wild. I've been thinking about going into Mexico and doing a show there for awhile. I want, I want to do something. Probably Albuquerque is a good place to go, right? Albuquerque or Santa Fe. Where should I go? A Santa Fe is an hour away, so come in Albuquerque and then boom, boom. There's a lot of stuff right around. Come on. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Uh, there's, there's the, the Apache caged area, Apache, Ms Dot petree reservations. It's still there. It's really a lot of grit, that energy, a lot of cool stuff. But

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       it's a secret. Let's not talk about it too late. So with regards to the, the honestly, the stuff that we were doing wasn't a whole lot different than a, what we're working on for the training camps, you know, we're working on foot, ankle, knee, hip stability in complex environments, in walking on, walking on logs are navigating different terrain while staying aware of my surroundings. You know, if I'm fucking sitting there looking at my feet and stumbling over myself and, and worrying so much about being quiet and where I'm standing fucking I miss miss a Goddamn, you know, some something right there. And I'm feeling with your feet saying that, that Irwin has that helped me out quite a bit as kind of a coaching cue is put your mind in your feet so that I'm looking here and I'm aware of what's going on around me, but I can feel where I'm going.

Speaker 4:          01:38:54       Boom. I, I hunted like a, like minimal boots so I can, you know, I could feel if I'm about to crack that, that stick and make that, you know, what kind of boosts who are, like, they're, they're called, the ones I use are called mini mill. Um, and they are high a, m I n I am I l l I think is what it is. And they're, they're dope man. So I think initially, uh, the, the, the vibrams fivefingers came into vogue in, in the military. They, they loved it, right? And everybody was all about the, uh, the minimal footwear. But if you go to minimal, too fast, you're going to hurt your feet because our feet, our bones, our tendons, our muscles are atrophied from being in basically casts for, for, you know, our, our entire life and all of a sudden I'm going to go run a couple miles like I did in these supportive shoes.

Speaker 4:          01:39:47       And you're going to get stress fractures, you're going to get all kinds of injuries. Um, so I think the military, a couple of the branches, band, the band, the five finger shoes or the five. Yeah. And that's what they're called. There's people getting hurt because your foot injuries, what are lots. Lots of people, people's body's physiology are just not ready to strike. And you have to work your way up to fight. And this. Yeah. This guy runs, runs barefoot throughout, through the mountains. You run barefoot. Yeah. Yeah. Don't wear any shoes at all. No. Well sometimes, but it depends on what I do, but I do try and also to be barefoot because it makes me extremely sharp mentally. You have to be extremely focused, just not injure yourself to be extremely, uh, adaptable. So he doesn't just drained, people think, oh, okay, so it's gonna make your, uh, the sole of your foot tougher. What about that? What's special about that? But that's not the point. That's not much many more benefits beyond just making your feet tougher. It's so fascinating that when in the invention of the running shoe, which what they thought was an advancement, oh, we're going put cushioning. It'll

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       save people's bodies, the wear and tear, and it actually wound up fucking people up and getting more injured. The food is a masterpiece. There's nothing to change about about it. Human food is a masterpiece and a, yeah, you try to come up with some science caring science shoes, footwear. It's bullshit, but also just need minimal minimal protection to avoid abrasion and end punctures and things like that. But otherwise you need to lead the work, uh, the work as naturally as possible. And if you don't then you will make your feet weaker, right? It will, it will, it will shrink it, it will numb it. But then on the flip side of that coin, I can't, my feet aren't strong enough to just go and run as I would normally in completely minimal shoes. I have to kick back, I have to kick back the intensity and the distance.

Speaker 3:          01:41:49       So if I really want to get a really hard, hard run in and, and, and get, get fatigued, I need, I throw on some, some regular old running shoes. Shorter distances. I'm, I'm like specifically training my feet and you know, and, and, and, and, uh, uh, conditioning my tissues and everything to be able to do that. And that's, you know, that's kind of a, a distinction. And, and, and moving to hurt myself, moving, moving barefoot in wall and environments is not, um, it's not men mandatory to people say one a mandatory, forgive my French. I just thought when I have to do the math in my head as to what you said, I feel like I have to clarify for people as well. That's good. Thanks. Um, yeah, you don't have, it's not mandatory. Mandatory. Mandatory. Mandatory correcting. Sorry, my English is very good. English was better than my French.

Speaker 3:          01:42:44       Um, you, you start, you start a resetting your body in a, in a, in a more natural way through these natural movement patterns, and you can do that in indoors environment, even wearing some minimal footwear and then you remove a footwear and then you start to expose the body through these natural movement on more challenging, more complex environments. Ultimately if you want to, you can become, you can go through these more say bad ass trainings where it's like the real deal. You're in the wild. They're maybe cactus and sharp stones and all kinds of things. And, and, and, and, and still you can do that, but that doesn't mean that you have to do that right away. Or did you ever have to do that? Um, uh, the bowhunting practice was, yeah, these balancing movements. The point was not just the movement itself is when you move in complex environments, there are also situations.

Speaker 3:          01:43:40       If, for instance, you're hunting, you'll goal is to catch the game. So you need to be aware of what's going on. You need to avoid being detected and you need to look and scan your surroundings and be as light as possible, a silent as possible. If you're already in trouble with your movement. If you're already struggling, we have a movement. How much of your brain activity and awareness is going to be dedicated to the situation itself, which is the hunting part because the, the, the movement part in the, in the environment part is already. It's not there. Your struggling. Uh, it's not just a matter of, oh, I have some cardio, so I'm good. No, well maybe you have hard time just kneeling, getting up and getting down, let alone in a supple silence move way that is not the deck detectable. So what?

Speaker 2:          01:44:32       Well, learning kind of things were trending, bow hunting in particular, sort of experienced this, uh, most recently, this fitness mo movement where a lot of guys are getting in extremely good shape to be able to run the mountains so that they can hike long distances and not be fatigued and so that they can take shots like in, have some mobility where you can be on your knees and for long periods of time you might have to be held at full draw while animals looking at you after having run up a hill. You're fatigued. Yeah. Yeah. And it's the difference between being successful and not being successful. I mean in today's day you could still go to the supermarket, but ultimately what it means is whether or not you can eat or not eat. So you have to be in physical shape to be able to do that kind of hunting. And a lot of it is at high altitudes. So you're trudging through the mountains of low oxygen. The body and mind I have

Speaker 3:          01:45:25       to deal with so many diverse variable changing in. That's, that's again, that's adaptability. It's about adaptability a gut. The chance, uh, to, to train the seals in Coronado, and these guys are well, number one, they are gentlemen, they are real good, good people, but they are extremely fit from the stance, uh, the standpoint of how much they can run, how much they can end dirt, but I would challenge them with very simple movements, a chai, some of the movements with Trent together with Carlos, uh, the, when you were in that split squat position, and you pivot, reverse your orientation from forward to backward and while maybe holding a stick that represents a rifle or bow or via camera if you're shooting photos. So if you're struggling with that movement, you have imbalances. How much, again of your situational awareness can be dedicated to the situation at hand, at stake.

Speaker 3:          01:46:25       That's a good point. You surviving the movement will excuse me in the close to the mic. Oh, alright. And then for a split second or maybe for a little longer, a, you're in trouble. So, uh, in, in, in the cage situation, it's very similar because you need to always keep an eye on your it. So you need that situational awareness. Well. So not having to think exclusively at how you move. So the more comfortable in movement, the more fluid, the more second nature it becomes, then the more attention your brain can dedicate to the situation and to the adaptability, the range, the timing. All of these subtle little adaptations in your brain is in charge of brain commands, not the body. So the money deans to be able to, uh, to, to, to move a highly reliable way ultimately that it is the movement itself or the situation, situational awareness. It all boils down to the brain.

Speaker 5:          01:47:28       What I was getting at before with the bowhunting is a. and with regards to your diet diet, do you eat wild game or do you get like what I do? Yeah. Um, mainly I eat a grass fed free range meats. I get as much wild game as I can. Like I said, I didn't kill anything in the last two years, but the people that I, I did go with, did they, they, they harvest harvest elk. Um, so, you know, we all share that meet. So yeah, I eat as, as, as much wild game as possible because I feel like that's, I mean, that's about as pure as you can get. It really is healthy too. When you eat it. It does have a different effect on your body. You can feel it if you're, if you're health conscious and if you're aware of what you're taking in on a regular basis are sort of aware of how your body reacts.

Speaker 5:          01:48:15       You'll see it, you'll feel different when you eat wild game. It's just more nutrient dense. Yeah. Yeah. And, and there's, you know, there's other aspects to it, man. When you, when you see the animal die or you kill the animal, there's just a sense of gratitude. I feel like for this thing, giving its life to nourish your body as opposed to buying something in a nice little neat package with fucking Saran wrap over it. You don't even, you don't really think that a life was, you know, was separated, um, to give you two to nourish your body. But when you, when you go out and you see it or it's, you know, it's in front of you. You realize that you're a little bit more connected to what you're putting in your body and I think that disconnect is a part of the um, uh, the problem with our, with our food, you know, I guess sickness or food culture that we, you know, there were, there were experiencing these days.

Speaker 5:          01:49:11       The gratitude is certainly an aspect of it and also the connection, just to an understanding, a real understanding of what happened, how you got there, what, what this meal is and it just, it has, it feels better. It feels better to eat it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a mix of things you, you actually feel as opposed to just not even thinking about. Not even just now, Mike Dolce you were saying, uh, works with you for, or worked with you for this last camp. What was the difference? Like what, what different things did you eat and what, what approach did you take? Did you do any work to examine

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       your nutrient levels? I did not. I didn't do any blood work. Um, the difference was we didn't change what I was eating. We changed the structure and the timing of when I was eating, um, I, I was kind of a man. I didn't, I didn't have much of a structure. I was like, Oh, you know, I'm eating the right things. I'm, I'm, I'm good. Um, he, he's like, okay, well, no, this is, this is how we're going to do it. We're gonna, you know, gonna do, you're gonna sit down and you're going to eat till your full. Every three hours you're going to have two feedings. You're not going to kind of snack and graze here and there, which is what I was doing. Um, and uh, do to increase my energy levels. I'm immensely. How, so in what way? I feel awesome. So I, I don't know why, I don't know the physiology behind it, but, um, I think it's a hormonal.

Speaker 4:          01:50:39       I think I. So after I would eat these big meals, boom, oh, get, I would get tired. I get like a, um, kind of insulin dove, you know, be tired for a little while, but the next time I went to train, like I just felt like I had had more fuel. Um, you know, more energy, more sustenance for these training sessions. Um, and uh, my weight cut was, I, I've never had a weight cut as, as easy as that we were eating, you know, f full large meals right up until the night or even the night night before weigh ins. Why I was, I was, I was, I came down so quickly and I, I kind of have a weird deal, man. My, I feel like my body, I've, I've cut weight so many times. I have, you know, 40 plus professional fights, you know, between kickboxing and MMA and I think my body just kind of knows.

Speaker 4:          01:51:31       It just drops. Even Mike's like, dude, I've never worked with an athlete that just boom, boom. It was just, it's just on a schedule, it just might, my weight drops. Um, and uh, yeah, but I felt, I felt amazing. I felt good in the fight. I think I look good in the fight. I performed well. Um, the, the cut was, the cut was awesome. So you're eating big meals, I mean, fairly bi relative, relatively big meals. How many calories have encountered out? So I would say I would have probably a, a, an eight ounce portion of, uh, of Salmon. I'm probably a cup of white rice and then a good amount of vegetables. Um, you know, we're talking about several times a day. Really? Yeah. Wow. That's interesting because most people think of weight cuts being that, you know, you severely restrict the amount of calories you have. Your body starts to go into ketosis or what have you, starts absorbing fat instead of, uh, instead of carbohydrates, you dehydrate yourself. Then after that. And that's how you get to that state. Yeah. Well, I mean that's one way to do it and I've definitely done that way before. I've done it. A bunch of shitty. What's the worst way you've ever done it?

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       Just the chicken nuggets way, but hesitant right around that same time. Not, not eating. I remember. So my first kickboxing fight ever, I fought a guy named Andy Sour. I don't know if you're familiar with it. That was your first kick. My first fight. First kickboxing fight ever. Fucking as that you're managing. How long has andy been fighting then? He already his record at the time, I remember too, and for some 93 in one. Oh my God, that's so insane. It through when I was first kickboxing fat, all my God. So I was 12 and o as an mma is an MMA fighter. Oh my God. I was 19 years old. Um, I had maybe one or two amateur boxing fights and I had been training him or I'd been trying to kickboxing for a long time, but anyway, I go up to 91, 1993 and one.

Speaker 6:          01:53:36       Oh Man. What fucking governing body sanctioned that? Uh, it was in Japan was, I was, I was the guy who lived in Japan. Exactly. I was the guy that they were bringing in for the slaughter. Oh my God. Uh, I, I show up out there and I'm only, I think I remember I was only like eight pounds out and we didn't know what the fuck we were doing with, with regards to the weight cut at the time I was 19. And so I'm like, Oh shit. And I just stop eating. I just didn't eat for about four days. Oh No. Oh no, that's so meanwhile, eight pounds ain't shit. I'll do that. I'll do that. Yeah. The day before a crowd. Oh, we're good. Yep, exactly. Still still eats one of the sauna. Yeah. Yeah. And so I started myself for about four days and we check in your weight.

Speaker 6:          01:54:27       Oystar and yourself? Yeah, I think it was. I don't remember. It's a long time ago, but it was same day weigh ins to. Oh Christ. I waited in the morning and then fall about maybe eight or nine hours later. Oh my God. And uh, I went five rounds with him. I went, I, I got, I got my ass kicked, I got my ass kicked. But I, I learned a lot and I grew from the experience out. Imagine Shit. Any sours. A legend. Yeah. Yeah. That is so crazy. That was your first kickbox tk owed me with 17 seconds left to go. He shot, he had chopped my legs down. So to the point where I couldn't even stand, I was falling through the ropes, so it was all fucked. Wow. Yeah, it was awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:55:15       It was cool shot. I went back in, I came back to Albuquerque, I went down, down to the gym and these guys had been kind of throwing me around up to that point. I specific specifically remember Diego Sanchez, I mean at the time he's like king of the case champions, like the man in New Mexico managed Jackson's and you know, he always gave me a, you know, really, really, really tough fight at are tough sparring, sparring matches at that point. And after I went through that experience, it was just kinda like that. You can't do shit me. Wow. Nothing just changed you. Yeah. That's interesting. That's amazing. Well, what a fucking crazy matchup that is. That's criminal. You should find out whoever matched you up and go beat their ass. I know, I know. Who did it. I'm glad I shake their hand. That shaped me. Well, for you, for a guy like you, you can handle it, but God damn that could have.

Speaker 6:          01:56:05       And I think they knew that this column syndrome. Stockholm Syndrome, right? Yeah, right. Yeah. Would be becoming friends through captors. That's insane, man. What a crazy fucking match up. I've never seen. I've never seen it. I've never seen a video of it. I think it's out there. Wow. I think even Andy Sour hit me up on one of the social media. It's like asking if I had ever seen it. I'm like, no. Bad. Up to this point have not. It was an undershoot boxing rules, so shoot boxing, I don't know if you're familiar, was billed as no holds barred standup, so it throws and take downs with kickboxing. Oh, okay. No. Elbows like Draka. Remember when they used to do that? They were doing that in the United States for a while. Was a kickbox and would take downs. I don't remember that, but it. That's, that's what this was supposed to be.

Speaker 6:          01:56:58       Maury Smith did that for a little bit and standing submissions was yeah, you were supposed to be able to do standing submissions and I actually caught him in a few chokes standing and I think the rules were if the guy hits his knees, he's. They break it and they stop it. Why? I don't know. It was weird. It was. It was. It was cool, man. It was. It was a good experience. I was 19 years old. I got to go to Japan. Yeah. Well fight for, I don't know, probably 500 bucks. I don't even remember Japan's crazy. Did you see rising sea rise in Japanese? Um, the, the new year's show with fader. I did not ask ultimate freak show. Yeah, it was awesome. Cool. Yeah, it was almost like, kind of like early days of pride where it was like Kinda chaotic. Like Gabby Garcia was there. Two hundred 20 pounds.

Speaker 6:          01:57:51       I saw that fight. Yeah. Choose to the fucking ear lobes. She, she got dropped right off the bat, but she came back and she cracked the chick with a back fist fucking back faced coming back. Man Arlovski with Travis Brown. He landed a back fist. Oh, this one? Yeah, a regular back. It's not a spinning back fist. A regular back fist just to pimp, hand backhand. Pan Pan. But um, it was two days of fights. Wow. Yeah. Sakuraba. I might've been more than two days. Sakharova fought Aoki, which was just criminal. They shouldn't let Sakharov a fight anymore. It's just awful. The wound. It's not how old he is, it's the miles, you know. He's probably younger than Anderson. You know, if I had a gas, I would. I would say he's younger than Anderson, but the beatings that guy's taken. Did you see the Melvin manhoef fight when Melvin was soccer kick him and he was down.

Speaker 6:          01:58:47       It was so hard to watch those vandelay knockouts that he suffered. Those are brutal. Ruthless in that guy has been through the ringer. You know, he's, he's so corrupt. What a legend. Now that guy is what? A legend. Absolutely. I remember the first time I saw pride, I saw him fighting hoists gracie. Wow. That was that 90 minute fire. Was that 90 minute one and had he had hoists in that, that like dead to rights, newborn hoists would not tap what ended up happening? I was at a decision. Yeah. Well it was a draw because they want the 90 minutes and nothing happened. Yeah, I think it was a draw. I think that that's how they say no, no, no, no, no. Hoists broke his ankle. That's right. Didn't he break his ankle and he couldn't continue? Fuck. Why do I not remember that, Jamie?

Speaker 6:          01:59:34       I'll pull it up. He'll find out. All right, cool. There was two fights. They had another one in k one, and that was in America. I was there live for that one, and Noyce was juiced up. Pig was yoked up. Then he tested positive and they find him a fuck load of money. Don't know if favorite ever paid it, but he patched, but now he's back. He's fighting, which is crazy. He's fighting Ken shamrock. I saw that on a on tour. Yeah, it's the main event in February. That's crazy. Yeah. It's so strange. Yeah. I remember their fight was the first fight ever, so it was first UFC fight. I had ever seen Sakharova and hoists. No, no, no. Ten in Canada. Canada hoists and voice was choking the choke. Choked him with his ski. Yeah. It was wild, man. That was the early days. Men. The first fight I ever saw was Orlando veit versus rem co pardot when Graham called pardue took him down and elbowed the fuck out of him and from side control or you had them like that and I remember watching that going, oh Geez, a Christ.

Speaker 6:          02:00:37       What kind of fucking crazy sport is this? The pardot Guy Kinda hits him a few times. Then it kind of implies that he's knocked out and you kind of just let them go at the time. Would just let them mainly. Yeah. Oh, big John Big John was one of the reps back then. Crazy. You remember when? Um, uh, what the fuck is his name? Fought that Ninja dude. Pat Pat Smith. Pat Smith's fought some dude who was like doing, like they had his, his pre-fight video and it's preflight videos doing like Ninja techniques and like fucking all this crazy shit that doesn't really work. And then he got in there with Pat Smith who was a pretty seasoned kickboxer yeah. And it was dropping. Just wicked elbows on him from the mount and knocked him out and then woke him up and then knocked him out again before the ref stopped. Yeah, well he got up and was just a bath of blood. His whole head was essentially opened up, but that was the early days. Man. The early days were really fascinating because you, you were around martial arts before the USC,

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       so you had seen like, you know, you'd seen karate and you'd seen all these different judo and all this different stuff and nobody really knew what the best stuff was. I always knew that wrestlers could take it down. I always knew that was gonna be a problem because I wrestled in high school and I had a good buddy of mine, my friend Steven Arduino when I was doing taekwondo and he was wrestling. One of the reasons why I got into wrestling because I didn't think that he could take me down out in the grass. He was like, I can take you down anytime I want. I'm like, Bull Shit. He took me down over and over again. I was like, this is crazy. It was so humiliating, like he was just, he just took me down every time you want it to, and I was like, this is Matt.

Speaker 5:          02:02:16       I got to start wrestling. So I started wrestling. That's one of the reasons why I started. Another one dude got me in a headlock and fucking threw me down in the locker room. Could have beat me up, but didn't know it was like God dammit Braille. So I had to learn wrestling, but I always knew that wrestlers could take you down if they wanted to, but I always felt like a guy who knew a little bit of wrestling, it was a good kickboxer would probably be able to keep the fight standing, but then when he started choking people, I was like, oh no, it's a whole different thing. This is a completely different thing. That guy beat that guy from his back with a fuck winds on their back. Like it was just a whole new element. You know? It's interesting because you've been around from the WEC days, which were when you were the wec champ, like it was.

Speaker 5:          02:03:01       It was so small in comparison to what it is now for you to go from that to that last fight against Robbie in Vegas, which was just this massive fucking media event. You're fighting for the world title. You get there, the place is sold out. It's craziness. The roar of the crowd, you know, time and like what a fucking odyssey you've been through and your career because you, you were there sort of when it was kind of just starting to take off. Yeah. Yeah. I really got in on the ground level. Yeah. Even before Wec, I told you we were fighting. It's like 200, 300 person venues in the middle of the desert and it's been crazy, man. It's been a. it's been an incredible ride and it has been the coolest fucking thing ever I want to do as a young kid. None of this existed and, but I was into the early nineties martial arts movies and Ninja turtles and I wanted to be, wanted to be a Ninja. I, that's what I wanted to do. I remember my mom, that was the second movie that I had ever seen was the first Ninja turtles movie and I came out of there, what should fucking kicks and spinning shit and, and, uh, every, you know, from then on I was training to be something and just so happened I lived in a time that this came to be and lived in a city where there was this camp that was, you know, by, you know, kind of inexplicably good, um, for

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       a small podunk place like albuquerque, but not just an exclude explicably good for the, what it was, but also for the time. And it evolved, whereas a lot of those camps that were big back then, like the lion's den, they're gone. You know, the Pat Miletich is Jim. It's gone like these, these gyms that were really big at the time, they didn't evolve or they didn't carry on or for whatever reason, they stopped doing it. You know, your, your gym is not just evolved but evolved to be one of the premier gyms in the world. It's really kind of incredible. Yeah. And there's been a lot of change, you know, somebody, a law, like a lot of the original guys have branched off and are kind of doing their own thing. But um, yeah, the, the, the genesis of MMA in Albuquerque is kind of an interesting story.

Speaker 4:          02:05:28       Um, and, and I don't, I wasn't there, I was like, told this, I was, you know, this is kind of, you know, firsthand hearsay from the people who, who did develop this thing is that basically these guys from these different disciplines got together and they had watched the UFC and wanted to, oh, I have a wrestling background. This guy has a chemical background. This guy is like a, you know, a Akka karate kinda background, whatever. They all got together and they started formulating the shit in this one guy was a flight attendant and he was flying all over the country. And every, everywhere he'd stop, he would, he would go to these different schools because there wasn't the internet at the time. You couldn't jump on youtube and look at techniques. So he would go, the guy's name's Chris Luttrell and he cornered me for my fight against GSP, uh, and what is one of the founding members of Jackson's.

Speaker 4:          02:06:24       He was going to these different Jiu Jitsu judo pankration schools and see what they were doing that he was bringing the information back and they were. And then they were, you know, Kinda getting into the laboratory and see what was working. At the same time. Some of these guys were bouncers and police officers and, and, and literally using this stuff on the street in some, you know, some had roadhouse type fucking situations. That's awesome. Read. My original trainer was like a Patrick swayze from roadhouse type kinda guide. Tom Vaughn, I don't know if you know Tom von. Yeah, he means yes. And his NHP now in albuquerque as well. And he was, him and Greg were, I mean that, that he's one of the founding members as well. It's kind of crazy that there's two big gyms like that in a place as small as albuquerque that have UFC fighters while they split their. Yeah, they're from the same place. They they branched off at one point, but they split up. It's crazy that these both guys have developed really high level talent because they all came from the same, the same original. Think. That's

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       a fascinating story about the flight attendant. I'm sorry, what's the name again? Chris Luttrell. Cristal trial [inaudible] him traveling and doing that. That's similar to what Halas Gracie did. Whole holes did holes. Gracie traveled to America and learned a lot of wrestling shit and learn catch wrestling stuff. That's why the Americana is named the Americana. It's uh, it's uh, you know, it really came from American catch wrestling and they started incorporating into Brazilian jujitsu along with some wrestling techniques and some sambo. And he learned a bunch of Shit. And he was the guy that really was Hickson's mentor. He was the guy that was the head of the family before he died. He was the man and he died in a hang gliding accident and Rio. Yeah. And he was the, he was the guy, like he was the head of the, all the others, you know, he was the one alpha of all the, uh, the grapplers. And he, he was dedicated to learning and incorporating different techniques, I think, like in any other context of those were the most adaptable and most open to change and evolution or those who survive looked for a remember Eddie Bravo, uh, showing uh, he, he's approach to and Resi Hixon Gracie. And why is it so hard? Why is it hard on me?

Speaker 6:          02:08:52       And he was, despite his, he's amazing knowledge and background and achievements. He was open enough to listen carefully, respectfully with Vienna, with humility. But you even asked questions like Hickson was asking questions about different aspects of the positions and coming from the, the, the Bjj world. That's, that's unusual actually will hixon is a very unusual guy. Hickson was a Yogi, like he was the first guy to incorporate yoga and he is a legit Yogi, like have you ever seen the videos of him doing those exercises in Santa Monica where he's balancing on one leg and he puts his leg up and a full split is incredible control of his body and enhance the, the people, uh, uh, legitimately, legitimately saying, hey, rickson was the first to implement movement spreading. He was, yeah, he was, but here's the thing to me, uh, I want to pay tribute to all coaches that they are Moitai, tighe, striking coaches, Judah coaches, even strength and conditioning coaches.

Speaker 6:          02:10:01       They all, all movement trainers and movements, fishers, they all are well more or less specialized, but they are. It's a movement. It is. And you know, there's an interesting aspect that's going on right now in 10th planet Jujitsu with break dancers. There's a bunch of these guys like Richard Martinez who was a break dancer, like amazing breakdancer and his brother Geo. These guys, they can do crazy shit with their body. They standing on one hand and spinning around and because of that you have another term hip hop a lot about how you control your hips, which is the fundamental of Jujitsu. It's, I don't think that's where like because it rhymed, it came from, it came from like, I'm hip hop dance, different sugarhill bent hip hop, hip hop. What'd you guys had? Incredible movement. They didn't show it much. They had to to. They're the rhymes over shadowed their fucking stability, their courses.

Speaker 6:          02:11:00       There's the dance and then there's the music and then there is in Breck Denson. You're going to use these guys. You're going to use your hips a like crazy. I'll. His movements are achieved because you have great hip control. Look at Ninja Jitsu. He must have this drip country. Look at this control. Play that from the beginning. Jamie, watch with this guy can do this is just one of the breakdown. Look at he's standing on his fucking head justice said, but trying roles. Yeah. All sorts of stuff. Absolutely. Well these guys, um, when Eddie first started training them, enrolling with them, he was amazed at how freakishly strong they were and you know, you look at them, they look like regular people, but it's the physical control of their body is just spectacular because of, you know, it's essentially similar to gymnastics and a lot of ways like, look at this fucking ego level.

Speaker 6:          02:11:53       Oh my God. And walking on his hands. This is nuts, man. That is fucking nuts. What's the name of this video, Jamie? So people are listening to like watch this 10th planet break dance crew freak show. Yeah, they all call themselves freak show. He's got a, he owns 10th planet San Diego trying to submit himself. Uh, yeah, you can submit himself. There's a couple of kids that can put themselves in triangles, like legitimately put themselves in trials. So we get this fucking shit. I'm sassing but admire at the same time. This Kale. It's, there's no doubt. Oh, there's no doubt of the physical control of the body is just spectacular. And this is the first time I've seen this, but I mean I can see that the application to combat sport. Yeah. Immediately I've rolled with a couple of these guys. They're fucking freaks. I can't hold onto them.

Speaker 6:          02:12:42       Yeah. They move all over the place and they can catch you in shit from all sorts of weird angles like look at that and he's on one hand that he puts his legs and full logus standing on one hand jumping up and down. Tenth Planet Jiu Jitsu is a very, uh, explorative innovative school of, of Jujitsu and um, in, in the, in the game of MMA, of those gyms who also are open and collaborative, arguing to kid themselves. You know, at the upper echelon, um, and those who don't evolve will, will disappear because it isn't till the methods, the, the end result is the same. It's the fight it's fighting, but the methods to get there and to be proficient at it, it's, it boils down to the methods that you use. And uh,

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       with uh, with Carlos there was a, there was no resistance when I approached him and start to try and he talk to his coaches about it and they, they may not understand right away exactly what it was about. Well, what was going to bring to his game, but they were at least open to it and eventually this saw a what together we've been able to, to improve and achieve. And if, if, if it didn't have that attitude, then Carlos would have not benefited you contact a Jackson and Gregg and winkeljohn before you worked with her one or did you try it out first and go, Hey, uh, I think I'm onto something. Um, I think, I don't know, I don't, I don't remember how that worked, but it was really interesting in Erwin touched on it earlier, was that they saw the same thing. They both watch it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:24       So after my widening the stance, yeah. And, and the, the ability to move forward and back we me and uh, and uh, Greg Jackson sat and he wanted to watch a couple of my fights and we want to see what we're doing well and what we needed improvement on a few things and I started work with Erwin completely independently and you know, we're walking on logs and this and that. And he's like, well, this is kind of a plan that I have for you and this is what I see. And it was exactly the same thing that Greg Jackson, who is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds in mma saw. I'm Erwin, is a movement specialist in Irwin had a plan and a strategy on how to improve that. Um, what was Jackson's idea of dealing with it? What did he think? He knew what needed to be done.

Speaker 4:          02:15:11       I don't think he necessarily knew how to get there. So he knew that you needed to be able to move in and out better? Yes, but he didn't have any strategy. I wouldn't say that he didn't have any strategy. It was kind of, okay, you know, we'll work on that. Let's figure out how. Let's, let's work on that. But I'd be just drill it. Yeah, exactly. Drilling a Irwin and I, we, we videotaped my, we videotaped us moving across the same, the same distance and the students fast man, he's like a fucking deer. He moves really, really, really quickly. He can run, he can, he does. He's got that look into that fund myself and the color of the wood with me being a so called deer and these guy with his boat because he shoots like super sharp. Uh, so, uh, so videos you're going back and forth and so we're, you know, we're looking at and we're, we're, we're looking at this stuff in slow mo frame by frame where his body position is compared to where mine is and what's the difference.

Speaker 4:          02:16:09       He's moving faster because boom, he's more upright. He doesn't have so much weight on his front foot that he asked to load and take another half second before he just, he springs backwards. Right? And so we're like, boom, that's it. This is what, this is what we need to improve on, this is what we need to do. Now we're going drill it and, and there's a variety of different things to kind of in a, you know, it's still that, that a stance in the posture as a, on a neuromuscular level. Are you having other fighters approaching now? Not yet, but really I saw that video. I would imagine the video. Have you guys trained together? There is still some, probably some skepticism can have West this Moltmann coaching and lucky and it looks like it doesn't have. It doesn't look like Jesus doesn't have a man bun and Isu have foreign accent. It's a ripoff.

Speaker 4:          02:17:09       Right? So, um, I think that they don't know exactly what it is about the end. They probably believe that it's either rent a random or. But if you listen to what Carla says, um, it is actually, it was highly specific because a can't be three months, we would train once a week, maybe sometimes twice a week, but that's still a limit on amount of time to make those changes happen. So I had to choose my battle and then I, I, I, I, I told Carlos, listen, this is what I believe we need to work on and just focus on. And we did that for the first camp and then the second camp for a loader was completely different, completely different, uh, and, and highly specific to, uh, improving, uh, kicking. What were you gonna say you're going to say we actually, we do have some guys that are, they've been doing this kind of independently.

Speaker 4:          02:18:02       They, one of the, one of the guys, young guy, and they're fighting on like amateur and regional levels, but you have a feeling we're gonna you're going to know their names here in the next couple of years. They're up and coming. Guys, they're young, like 21, 22, 23 year old, you know, kind of making their way. Um, one of them has been watching Irwin's videos since he was 15 years old. He met her when he was all star struck. Oh my God, this is the core. How did you even, you know, and, uh, uh, they are incorporating movement quite a bit, so it's not, you know, it's not that they haven't sought him out there, they're kind of very interested in this and doing their own stuff and, and, and finding this stuff on online and watching the door tech portal stuff, watching Irwin's stuff and um, and, and definitely incorporating a lot of this stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:18:52       And one of the kids is a gymnast, a gymnast before and, and so now he can do all kinds of crazy shit and they're looking for a niche. Definitely they'll looking for an edge. Even Carlos was looking for, well George St Pierre was doing a lot of gymnastics. Cummings does a lot of that as well. It's the same thing now we're like, we, you know, we see with conor mcgregor. So it's like this big thing. All of this, uh, uh, GSP was, he was, he was doing gymnastics for the same exact reasons to be able to move his body better through, through space and ultimately become a better able to better beat the shit out of people. That's the goal, right? You know, it's, it's, it's fun and it's cool. It's a cool way to train and, you know, after the fact, I think it's, is a cool fitness, mobile modality that's very different.

Speaker 4:          02:19:42       I, I absolutely love it. I've been an athlete all my life and I can, I plan on being an athlete to the fucking day I die. How much longer do you think you're going to be fighting? Um, have you considered that? Oh yeah, because I've heard you talking about that after the Robbie lawler fight. Um, I dunno, I dunno, it's, I'm, I'm probably, you know, 31. I'll be 32 in a few months. You're still in your prime? I am, but you know, this has been, it's been a long road. You know, I started training profession. There's fighting professionally at 18 have had 40, you know, over 40 fights and you feel it. You get dinged up, I get dinged up and I, I still feel great, I think. I think my concern is the longterm neurological stuff that is kind of coming to light with, you know, with all this studies on concussions and you've seen me fight.

Speaker 4:          02:20:35       I don't, I don't go in there and not take damage and I fucking take damage, you know, I take take punishment, I take, I'll take two to give one and that's just Kinda my style. And well you didn't fight like that and Nick Diaz fight. That was like one of the few fights we didn't fight like that. Yeah. You know, I felt I had seen a lot of guys go in against Nick Diaz and gas themselves out trying to knock that guy out. And it's like he can't, you can't knock him out. He took a full on a left hook from, from Paul Daley, flopped around a little bit, pop back up. Paul Daley Blues was trying to finish him and then and then got knocked the fuck out himself. And I've seen a lot of guys, you know, hurt him, but he's so God damn toughy, so hard to put away.

Speaker 4:          02:21:21       And so yeah, it was more of a, um, of a calculated approach, you know, as I got flowing later in the fight, I started opening up a little bit. But, um, I think that's what a lot of new ideas or strategies he, he wants for what he wants to get in your head and he wants you to fight emotionally. He wants you to sit there and have a face punch, punch competition with, you know, oh, we're going to stand here like it's the fucking school yard. Was he talking about shit to you? He was, but I just, I knew I knew what he's gonna do. I mean, I grew, I grew up with tools like that, you know, my whole life I was. So I was kind of used to that and I knew that I was going to have to be emotionally. I'm a prepared. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Emotionally, uh, kind of shut down and just fight a strategic fucking game plan against the guy. Yeah, it was, uh, it was interesting to watch that fight because he was extremely frustrated by that, you know, and he couldn't get you to change, you know, whereas he's been able to fuck with guys

Speaker 6:          02:22:25       heads like the frank shamrock fight. Like you could see frank shamrock going, I can't fucking believe this is happening to me. Like when nick was talking shit to him, like what bitch, what? And then popping them with a jab. You could see like for some people that shit-talking becomes overwhelming with nick. Yeah. You know, it's funny is a, both me and cowboy fought the Diaz brothers within a few weeks of each other. Right. A cowboy lost to nate and I fought nick just a few weeks later. And in, in preparation for both of our camps we would, we were switching roles and both fighting southpaws and both fighting one round I would fight southpaws talk a bunch of shit and try and try, try and try to get, you know, try to emulate his style. And then the next round he would do the same. This is yell out Stockton motherfucker.

Speaker 6:          02:23:18       I, I, I did my best in pressure, reminds me of a Buddhist, a hmong drill where they're all in their meditation posture and uh, they, they partner up and the other guys like trying to instigate them and no crap to them to have them get out of their meditation as the drill the. Well, there's definitely something to that. I mean, if you're not used to people that talk shit when someone talks shit to you, it can be emotionally devastating what's happening here. But if you used to be like, fuck you, I've heard this shit, you know, it becomes normal. You know? I mean, I tried to explain that to fighters when they deal with online criticism as well. Like I've talked to guys who would go on like the underground and see like some shit that people are talking about them and just be fucking devastated and get so upset.

Speaker 6:          02:24:08       And I was like, look man, you got to treat it like snake venom. You get a little bit of that shit in your system and you're going to be okay. You get a little bit more and eventually you build up an immunity to it and then you go, oh, I get it. You're just a bunch of little console who've never accomplished shit. So you talking shit about fighters calling them pussies and like, because some fighters you have a loss and you're like, good, I'm glad he got knocked out. I fucking hate watching that guy fight. He's a pussy like damn stuff. Oh my God. It's initially it as like, it was like, whoa. After that, you know, I'd never experienced that until really until after the deal is there had been some. But after the Diaz fight, I mean, you know that big time. So yeah, I call it the shifts and what I call it, the unique snowflakes. A snowflake syndrome. Lucky or told, since you're a kid, you're a unique snowflake, but the problem is that day they can't stand the heat. Does that make sense? Who are you talking about them? I love who is the unique snowflake, the person talking shit or the fighter, whoever is like being told all the time, hey, it's okay to be different or it's okay to be this. And that problem is that sometimes you do need to, uh, hear stuff about

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       yourself that is challenging and to take it to not crumble, crumble really know. You need to hear it. I mean, I would, I would appreciate it man. It's hard because I like both ways. I kind of love like Nate Diaz punching Michael Johnson the face and then pointing at them. Ah, I just fucked you up. Like, it's funny, you know, when Anderson fought nick and nick laid down on his back and pretended to sleep, sleeping for a second. I was fucking crying, laughing. I love it when conor mcgregor talks mad shit to Joseph all for months until he just rent space in his head to the point where although just he literally can't fight his fight. He has to run at conor because he's just so overwhelmed with emotion. And then connor sleep some. You know what I mean? I like both, but I prefer in a. In a perfect world, I prefer martial artists.

Speaker 5:          02:26:12       I prefer guys that go out there, treat each other with respect, shake each other's hands and then just go out and just let their skill, but it's an effective tactic to these fighters. It's part of their weapons. Fuck. It's not something outside their their game. It's completely embedded in their whole game. Oh yeah. Well, it's also a slider is defined themselves by respect, by how much someone respects them and how. How much like like to a fighter when someone's not scared with them, it becomes a very devastating thing. Like I remember when Anderson fought Chris Weidman when right Weidman and they understand what the winds and Anderson staring at him looking at him and Weidman goes, I'm not scared of you, dude. I'm not scared of you. And you could see Anderson was like, shit, this guy really isn't fucking scared of me. Like you could see there was a tangible moment where this guy wasn't pretending.

Speaker 5:          02:27:02       He wasn't scared. He just literally wasn't scared. Then I could feel it. That similar situation at the weigh ins with Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm. Yes. Same thing and I felt like that was a precursor to what ended up happening. Well, the big part was when Holly didn't flinch exactly when Rhonda was yelling at you, fake bitch, you know, preacher's daughter, all this stuff and stuff, and she bought all this stuff on instagram about her and holly just standing there and then when I interviewed holly afterward she goes, well, it's just trying to get a sip of water. And you realized like, Whoa, this girl is so fucking composed, like so composed. And it also, she had been to so many dances. She fought for so many boxing titles and kickboxing and MMA. She'd been in so many dances that the bright lights were in an uncomfortable thing to her.

Speaker 5:          02:27:50       She had. She's like, okay, we're here again now. Whereas for a lot of people it's like, Whoa, this is the big show. Holy Shit. I can't believe I'm here. Yup. Being overwhelmed by the moment is almost something that you can't prepare for it. It seems to me that for a lot of people, some people just naturally can deal with moments and some people they have to experience it a couple times to get loose. They get got to get comfortable with it and then they have to like some people like cowboys. A perfect example. He fights his best when he fights a lot. He's got to fight all the time. He fights three, four times a year in then you're going to get the best cowboy you can get, but you make them take a year off or take a long time off and it's just. He's much better when he's active.

Speaker 5:          02:28:32       He's gotta stay loose and loosened up and fired up and to fight with Tim tiffany means is going to be fucking crazy. Yeah. They announced that. I was like, whoa. Why did cowboy decided to take that fight? Because he doesn't like cutting weight. I have no idea. I don't know. I haven't. I haven't talked to cowboy, but I mean I said, hey, what's up? You know, we didn't, but we didn't really talk about the fight at all. Well, he's so crazy. You could probably offer him brock lesnar. He left. Come on, bring it on. Oh, for sure. Exactly. Do it. That's it. That's why he's because he's cowboy. Yeah. He's just nuts, man. Yeah. He's a fun dude, man. Yeah, absolutely fun to watch. Fight and fuck. He's either. He's either on or he's off. Yeah, unfortunately. Unfortunately. Well, I don't even necessarily know if he wasn't that he was not on.

Speaker 5:          02:29:15       I said Dos Anjos. He's a fucking demon. He's just jumps all over you. He did that to him. Did that to pettis? Yeah. Nobody's done that to pedis man. Dude, but he's just so fucking fat and again, he's a guy who trains with nickerson. Nickerson has gotten doing all these plyometrics and jumps and sprints and foot strengthening stuff. You ever seen that stuff with her? They're lying on their back and their feet are pushing up these bars and they're kicking up these bars and catching them with their feet and exploding with their feet. I saw, I saw the video for the cowboy fights. It's all based on Marv Marinovich is training stretch strategies as the same sort of shit that he used with Bj Penn. Really, it's really interesting that I remember watching that and bj was standing on the tennis balls and all that sort of, you know, very similar, very similar.

Speaker 5:          02:30:07       And it's, you know, it's all veRy similar, kind of look at different ways to different branches, but it's all kind of, you know, all this, you know, the same goal. So what's next for you now? Do you hang back for what? You had a brutal, crazy five round war for the title where it was as close as you're ever going to fucking get. I mean, a lot of people saw it your way. A lot of people saw a robbie's way was just that close split decision. Um, what do you do now? Um, I, I'd like another shot at robbie, you know, I, I felt like I won the fight. Um, and like you said, it's razor, razor close decision could have gone either way. Mma, judgIng a subjective, the scoring system so fucking crazy to it is nuts that we're still using that 10 point must system.

Speaker 5:          02:30:58       Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't, doesn't apply very well to animate it in. That's proven over and over again. Um, yeah. I mean, I'd, I'd like another shot at, uh, at robby, I feel like I should have the belt right now, but it seems like tyron woodley's next, right? I mean at least he was sort of promised that and based on the hendricks we're hendrix didn't make weight and um, it seems like that's what's probably being set up, but you never know what the doc mean. Misha tate was supposed to fight ronda if she Beat jessica. I think that's who it was. And then they decided no. so it's, it's interesting because the ufc kinda decided to call the shots. Has anybody talked to you about whether or not they would do that again? Uh, I think it's, it's definitely a possibility. Uh, you know, I think the first fight they made that fight because that was the fight that people wanted to see among any of the contenders that, that, that was the, that was the one that got everybody excited that that was the one and a rematch of that fight.

Speaker 5:          02:32:01       Oh yeah, come on now. Well, I think as far as public interest, that would be the biggest fight out there. Yeah. But I feel like I just hate when someone gets promised something, you know, and I would feel the same way if it was you like tyron woodley get promised that title fight. If he beat hendrix, hendrix fucks up. It doesn't make weight and the fight fights off and then woodley sorta left out to dry. I feel for him, you know, and I do too. And, and shit, you know, have, I have a last woodley and that that's definitely on my radar to, to, to avenge that loss, a loss like that and injury loss. Fuck with you as much as a loss by decision or you know, I mean that's a kind of a crazy loss because you need blew out. Yeah, I think even more so just because the fact that I, I didn't get to do as much as I wanted it to do, you know, I didn't, I didn't get to leave everything out there.

Speaker 5:          02:32:54       This, this last one. That's a bummer. I didn't take the belt home that night. Didn't go my way, but I pushed it. I was able to fucking empty the tank. He definitely emptied the tank. Yeah. And in the woodley fight I didn't. Um, I, you know, my body gave out my knee blew out. So, um, yeah, from that perspective, I, I definitely see where you're coming from. YeAh, I mean, yeah, he, he was promised a fight, but I'm not in charge of tyron. I'm not in charge of picking the fight. I'm in charge of, you know, carlos condit and trying to get myself in the best fight. That being said, you know, honestly, that's about the only fight that interests me at this point. Well, I'll tell you what, I wouldn't be mad if they decided to make a rematch. I feel bad for tyron, but a fuck.

Speaker 5:          02:33:38       I'd love to see that again. Yeah, I'd love to do that again. That's how much time would you need off after a fight like that? Um, I think it'd be, it'd be ready to go and, you know, late spring, early summer, ufc 200. Sounds good to me. Sounds good to me. I don't know. That would be, that'd be ufc 200. That's home. My goodness. You know, I, I, I wanted that fight to be legendary and I think that it lived up to that. Oh, it was legend and it was one of the greatest fights I've ever seen. yeah. so I've probably called 1500 fights or something like that. Something crazy like that. That was easily in

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       the top 10. Just everybody wants to see a sequel, a concept like an unfinished. Tyron woodley. He's right now listening to golf and I, I understand where he's coming from, but yeah, I get it. I get it to hey, maybe they can go fucking give him a little. Sorry. Alyssa tyron, kick back, relax, have a good time. Um, but, uh, you know, I dunno, I still, I still love this shit. I mean, I still, I still love the process 20, can't even fucking fight week. I enjoy and you know, that's awesome. One of my favorite things in life is to get in there and pick and mix it up with a guy like robbie so. Well it was one of my favorite things to watch because it was just an amazing fire. It was, like I said, after the fight, it was an honor. It was an honor to be there and to call it because I know that when

Speaker 5:          02:35:12       this was all over and we're old and we're sitting around at a bar at a picnic someday or were picnicking. If I want to, talking about, we're talking about the past, we're going to talk about that fight. You know, the way people talk about leonard and duran or with the way people talk about any great crazy fight that they were. They were there for, you know, and in winter lose. Ultimately that's, that's what I want to be said. That's the legacy that I want to leave. Well, I think it was martial arts in its best form and a lot of ways it was a heart determination, willpower technique, uh, the discipline to go through camp to get yourself in the kind of shape that you need to be in, to compete for five rounds like that, which is just an insane amount of physical conditioning immune. You guys fucking emptied and your workload was extremely high in that fight especially kicks. I remember that was one of the things that we commented on, like how many kicks you had thrown. I mean, it was a really a really fucking crazy, crazy fight.

Speaker 6:          02:36:12       Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was fun, man. I had fun. I don't know, maybe maybe I'm a little bit twisted, but, uh, that was uh, I was definitely say you're a little bit of, you know, that was the kicks were a big part of the strategy to, uh, I think that a lot of people wonder why is it that a lower was not as aggressive as usual. I believe there is a reason because it's not like he was less hungry or listened in shape. It's because the strategy worked, have a higher volume and a courtesy and uh, with, with those cakes to, to lower his, his aggressiveness and worked with kicks her always so dangerous too because it just takes one slip up, you know, it's there, there is so much harder than punches and you're taking them on your arms and they fuck your arms up the point where you can't throw punches anymore. So you gotta be careful what you absorb, right? It's part, it's the volume is statistically the volume is getting to create damage to two different diverse part the body.

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       So when, uh, you know, I've, I've heard the debate about the fight metrics, how I threw a lot, I didn't necessarily land a lot. Um, and I feel like the kick and the kicks and the, the volume of, of punches that I was, that I was throwing out was the equivalent of a say, putting down cover fire. If you were in a firefight. Yeah, you're not necessarily a, you know, you know, pop and people's nuggets, but you are, you know, that it's part of an overall strategy to, to come out with victory. You're, you're your throwing him off, you're making him keep his hands up, you're keeping that distance. You are making the enemy. Keep their head down in this analogy and you weren't also loading up either. You were touching them with a lot of theSe things and keep him on his toes and you know, that was something that dwayne was calling tj dillashaw to do in his fight with dominick cruz.

Speaker 4:          02:38:08       He was to just go out and touch them, just keep touching them and then the shots will come, but he got so emotional and tied up and trying to knock dominic out. You could see him standing flatfooted swinging more single shots, single kicks, single punches this. Yeah. This guy that had looked just incredibly dynamic with his footwork and his. He kind of looked like dominick cruz against other guys and look really well. Dominick cruz goes out there and makes him look like a very orthodox, a fighter. He's not, he's not moving like that. And at times, yeah, at times initially they came out and they were both moving like that. I'm like, oh, well this is. This is crazy. These guys are going to open up a worm hole. It's going to be wild. Well, I think that's what a lot of us expected, but um, it's interesting that would, what uriah said about tj, that he had a feeling that tj was going to get emotional because tj is a super competitive guy and he'd get really geared up and you know, that's a, that was an interesting fight.

Speaker 4:          02:39:08       Really interesting fight to watch. It's crazy that dominick cruz able to come back having essentially only fought once in four years. Yeah. And, and when the title. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. He's a different kind of animal. He's a smart motherfucker to. You talked to that guy. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I've known him since wec. I listened to his analysis of fights, like when he talks about like what mistakes guys make and things guys are doing right and correctly and what they need to do and you know, you realize like he's operating on a very, very high level, very high level. Absolutely. And that's probably part of why he was able to come back and compete at the level that he did because he, you know, he was sitting there analyzing this, you know, they, they talk about, you can sit there and do repetitions of a kick or a technique, you know, 100 times, but it, it's almost the same, uh, thing neurologically to visualize yourself doing that. They say that that visual visual training is a similar, very similar and almost as effective as actually doing it. Yeah. So I wonder if, I mean, I wonder if there's kind of a, of a correlation there. I would imagine there is. Well,

Speaker 6:          02:40:14       he's interesting in a way also because he says that there's no such thing as octagon rust like I asked him about and he's like, it's not real octagon, it's mental weakness if he believes that it's true, but when you watch the fight, it certainly looked true. I mean, he didn't look rusty at all. It's just fucking kind of nuts. Um, I think that's the thing. It's a belief thing. He's not going to let that. Not for one. One second. Hinder him, agree with carlos, because in the absence of of actual movement training, due to his injury, it's very likely that it was tilled visualizing everyday. He's movements in therefore using his brain to keep practicing the movements, even though a body could not, the body could not follow out that, you know, during that time you examine dominic's footwork to examine guys that are fighting.

Speaker 6:          02:41:03       Do you watch like different guys movements and it's close to perfection in easy using a particular technique. Yes, but also most importantly, it's all about he's alertness and responsiveness and timing that again, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's not how much your body can, can do it, how much your mind is. He's able to operate your body to achieve that. Yeah. So you need a brain that is extremely sharp. Um, well I was super impressed with him, but one of the things that I thought of when I watched that fight is goddamn how good his mighty mouse, you gotta take a leak. So what's going on? Yeah, let's just wrap this fucker up. Uh, it's, it's, uh, it's, yeah, we Did almost three hours, but listen, thank you very much was absolutely. Thank you everyone. Really appreciate it. Joe.
