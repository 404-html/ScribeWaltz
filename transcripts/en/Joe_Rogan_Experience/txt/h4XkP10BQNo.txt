Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Boom, and we're alive. Kevin Lee. Yes. It's about as fresh off of a fight as you can get, man. Yeah, just about barely slept. Yeah. It must've been a crazy, first of all, like after a fight it's probably you probably so wired and like can't believe it's over. Right. What does it like? It takes you a minute for it to hit you. Really? Uh, I didn't sleep at all after the fight. I just, I laid there for a little bit. Mind kind of racing, didn't really settle down. Uh, I just ended up just getting up, getting some breakfast and then a right on the plane over here. Densely ball and on playing came over here. Three Aum. I'd been up all morning. But you, what do you like 25? Yeah. Yeah. Keep going. Yeah, keep going. Rockstar lifestyle, baby. I've got to live it at 25. You can do that for like two days in a row before it really starts to settle it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Yeah. No, I'll be good for a minute. I mean, besides getting kicked in the head, I'm all good. Other than that did that, that was the, first of all, it was a very, very, very impressive performance. I mean, Edson Barboza is no fucking joke and notoriously difficult to take down. Even Khabib struggled getting him down the early parts of the first round, but you got them down quick. Yeah. I think a lot of people underestimate that, especially how technical my wrestling can get. Um, I, I just feel like Edison was really strong. Uh, he was probably the strongest guy that I've ever faced. Physically. It just, his body is just, it moved a little bit different, but technically I just had to the aspect there. And when, when you add those two things up, I'm equally as strong, you know? Yeah. I'm just going to blow him off the water.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Well, he's just a bundle of fast twitch muscle fiber, man. That dude, I mean, people, you know, they'll see the cubby fight and they'll see this fight with you. They might not understand how good that guy really is. He's very, very good. He's obese and he's going to come back and he's going to knock some people out. He's only gonna get better from here. I think it's just he, it's the styles make the fights too in me. I feel like I can fight any style, you know, that that was my number one goal when I got into this sport, just to be the most well rounded, complete fighter that there is an, and I feel like I can take advantage of some of his things that he's not good and good at, but he's going to get better at him. He's going to, he's going to be back.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       He's a beast. Well that focus in that mindset of being well rounded was very obvious in that fight. I was very impressed by the fact you, you fight just as good south southpaw as you do orthodox, you switch up easily. I've, I've been, uh, I've only been going south for maybe the past year, year and a half or so, uh, and just kind of getting a filler for a down. But I feel like that could be one of the, when you listen to a lot of the great fighters in, in the past, they talk about a right hand, a softball. There's so many advantages they can be there. Uh, and it's just, it's just always great to be able to switch up and change timings, especially when you've got a god that's, that's trying to time you like Edson, uh, because he say that, I'm sorry, but they say that if you work on the opposite side, it actually makes the other side better. Yeah. Yeah. It makes it a little bit easier when you switch back. And I've noticed that, I mean, still some, some

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       kinks and twist that I want to kind of get out of there. You know what you see, I study a lot of people. I study a lot of switch fighters, especially in MMA. Uh, recently, I want to say about the last two years. He hasn't been doing it more often, but some guys do it better than others. I try to get the perfect mix, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:03:17       Well, some guys do it, but there's a twist, right? Like wonder boy does it. But when Wonderboy does it, you know that the front leg is coming and then he's, you know, he's, he can fight any style. I mean he could fight left or right, but when he switches, when he goes right, you know that front leg side kicks coming, that front leg roundhouse kick is coming and then when he stands Orthodox, he's much more likely to throw a punch or you know, maybe even spin, he mixes it up. But he, he's limited maybe in the way he attacks

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       blending of it. I think Wonderboy is one of those guys that his switches are like really, uh, you could see him coming, you know, he, he makes them really pronounced, you know, they're big switches and you know, the, the attacks that are coming, there are certain guys like Tj Dillashaw who was great at mixing it up completely. I feel like he doesn't sit down on his punches too much or, you know, he gets in spots where he can get clip and between those with your feet off the ground. So I tried to find the happy medium between those two, switching up too much and uh, being able to make those hard switches too.

Speaker 3:          00:04:17       Teachers really been doing that style for just like three or four years now since he's been with bang. Maybe it was about, I want to say three years, four years.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Yeah. Probably some of that. It takes some time to get used to it, get used to the time in and everything. And, and that's one of the things with me, like I try and beat the most consistent a guy that there is out there. So the more consistently I'm getting in there, the more I'm seeing things come in. Um, um, um, reading the angles and, you know, getting a lot of different looks, a lot of different bodies being thrown at me. Uh, so all that adds up to experience and you know, it's only gonna get better from there.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       Yeah. It's also one of those things when you're 25 years old, you, you still are like realistically five years away from your athletic prime.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Yeah. I kept that. I keep that in the back of my mind sometimes because you know, you obviously don't want to overwork the body too much. You don't want to burn out. Uh, but I think it's just staying consistent, is staying healthy as long as I'm healthy through it. You know, I got through that fight. No, no serious damages at all. Uh, and that's the most important thing is just staying healthy when I'm young. Uh, and uh, you know, tail him back when I'm starting to get more damages are more injuries, but I do a great job with keeping my body all the, I think more than anything.

Speaker 3:          00:05:21       What do you like when you were in, I know Robert Follis was your coach for quite a long time and uh, we both miss him. I'm sure you, you were very close with him. He was such a great guy. Yeah. Yeah. Was he the guy that, like did he sort of map out your training program when you were in camp or,

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       you know, I had, uh, we, we kind of structured it, or at least I try and structure it like a full team, uh, aspect. You know, rob was kind of like, I think of it like a race car, you know, I'm, I'm the race car itself. Uh, but Robert was like the hit driver, you know, rob is telling me where to go, what to do a Dewey was kind of like my horsepower, you know, he's, yeah. Do Cooper, uh, phenomenal striking coach. If you ever, you know, task fighter with him. He, he was a smaller heavyweight, but he would fight giant guys like Peter Arts and a dude that you got to, you know, you look at him, he's only about two 26 foot one. Maybe he's fighting six foot, seven, 300 pound guys. So he has to be extra technical in there. Uh, not rely on his speed and power.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       That's why I think he, he makes such a great coaching and he pushes me through it. But I had another guy, I've been working with Cory Goodwin for the last four or five years since I've been on Vegas. He's kind of like the mechanic, you know, he keeps me, he keeps my body fresh and going is he, or strength and conditioning, but we call it that. But what we do is a lot different than, than strength and condition. And, you know, it's, it's not a lot of, I don't lift any weights and people when people are seating. Yeah. I haven't touched on weight since college. You know, the only time I did was when I went over and I started working with the UFC PR guys a little bit. They wanted me to touch weights, but, uh, I, I, it's just not a good fit for me.

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       Are you doing, what are you doing plyometrics or you're doing is he'd have to explain it to you more. You know, that's his, that's what he does. He, he worked through as xls for a long time, so he took a lot of their, their physiology or xls. What's exos? The, uh, I think they just signed a deal with the UFC to a lot of guys been going over and uh, they're a big strength and conditioning program. They'd get, they've got a big facility down in Arizona, but they used to be based out of Vegas. Uh, so he worked for them where he gets a lot of his training philosophies and stuff from a, but it's not, it's not any, any wait, listen, calisthenics. Chatting a lot of calisthenics, lot of movement, a lot of, we work a lot of the joints especially, you know, where he overextends my joints, he pushes them past, past the limit, and then we work out from there.

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       So it's not very heavy lift and it's maybe 15 pounds. Do you mean by pushing them past the limit? Like, like a hyper extended? Yeah, I mean, well, it's like you getting onboard. So, uh, one of the things we do is he takes a band and he, and he stretches it out so it really pulls my shoulder and I was telling you, I, I very rarely have shoulder problems and I think a large reason he, he pulls it all the way out, kind of out the socket. And then we work out from there to build strength from those, those little muscles. Uh, which I felt like is, is, that's the part where I get my true strength from. You know, I do that a lot of yoga, a lot, a lot of things that just, all the strength comes from within me. Not Lifting weights or anything.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       How often are you doing yoga when you're in camp? A two to three times a week. I've only been doing it for like four or five months since, since the 25. Uh, it's been helping me out a lot. When I, when I started doing it guys, we're like, oh, what are you lifting or something? I'm like, Nah, just I should, it's hard. I'm like, Oh fuck it. Just do it. Yoga like isn't it crazy how hard it is? Like you just fucking off like, yeah, I'm doing yoga. You Lazy Bitch, stretch and touching your toes. Maybe for like the first two months, like I'd be like ashamed to tell people. They're like, where are you going to, you know, going into this one class we're going to be lifting a lot of weights. We're going to be great. Like Shit. Nah, I'm in there with like dumb fucking know. Housewives, housewives and nick killing me. It's crazy, right? They killing me, killing me. I've done good now though, but a, I do a couple of different state, even the Vinyasa a little bit. I try and dabble, but I've only been doing it for a couple months now.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Now when you do, how do you structure your camp? Like it terms of like how much strength and conditioning you doing, how much skill work,

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       how much? So it kind of depended on, it depends on the opponent to, but generally I'm doing three times a week of, of some type of grappling, whether it has wrestling or, or, uh, Nogi uh, then I only s spar once a week at the end of the weeks, uh, we pick our spar partners that we pay, that we choose, you know, we flogged guys in or guys that are in town, cause I'm in Vegas. All gods are always in and out. Right. Um, but then, uh, you know, I only, I only do strength conditioning maybe two times a week. Not Too much.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       Now when you say, um, you spar once a week and you bring guys in, um, are you sparring hard or do you far more technical?

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       Don't make camp, uh, maybe four or five. Good. But I go pretty hard and it ruins me sometimes cause I run out of sparring partners and guys don't want to show up and all this. But uh, I ended up having to start paying guys just come on man, give me some words.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       Right. Yeah, we try and make some money. Do you think that that's the way to go? Like, um, for longevity there's a, there's a big debate, right? Whether or not you should sparse skill wise and then save it up for the fight or whether you should just fucking go to war. I think, I think you need that,

Speaker 2:          00:10:36       that reaction time, you know, with a god that's seriously throwing at you. And I mean we're, we're not trying to hurt each other for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       The smart partners, 80%, maybe 70%, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       W W we go pretty hard up until you obviously can see that there's an injury or somebody is hurt or you know, you backed down. And even on like some of my takedowns I bagged down, obviously I'm not trying to knock the guy out, but I am trying to give them some good work. And I hope he does the same return, but we picked smart guys that will do it. That's what it's about at that level. When you got two very high level guys going against each other, we can go hard and not injure. If I'm going with like a new guy or you know, it's a newer team, like I don't even try. I gonna make

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       a name off a few fuck around this. There's a lot of that man. Too much. Yeah. I remember I ran into [inaudible] once and his hand was in a cast and he hadn't had a fight in a while. I said, what happened? He said, some new guy came into the gym and he's sparring with this new guy and this new guy is trying to kill him and he broke his hand on this dude's for it. And I was thinking, your Vito Belfort, I mean, and this is Vito. Or like I want to say like eight, nine years ago. I was like, man, like that's crazy. But that's the kind of shit that happens. Right. And guys are very tough in a gym. I mean, especially something illegal, like they tougher than you think. [inaudible] 16 and they're tough. They're coming out with, with, you know, newest. I think

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       each dinner generation has a new style to that. You're, you, you, you don't get used to it. And if it, you know, if the boys are catch you, if they, they'd be hungry or they knew, uh, what you're seeing all these new guys that are coming up that can do everything. You know, they, they have like taekwondo skills. They've got Moyie Thai, they can wrestle, they do flying armbars and shit. There's just kids are, because MMA is such a part of like the zeitgeists now and everybody understands it and kids know, if you want to be a really tough fighter, it's not about boxing, it's about MMA. And so you're getting these wild ass kids that have really young age practicing this shit on each other, learning it, trying going to gyms when they're nine, 10 years old. By the time they're in high school, they're killers.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       Yeah. I mean, and we have so many of them that come through Vegas especially. And I think that's what, that's my favorite part about living there is, is the, the training partners. And like you said, the new kids. I try and even though I'm only 25, I'm trying to see what they doing that's coming up next. That's smart because they, they're going to come with something that UAC before it is some out there. Like, like even my younger brother, uh, my younger brothers just getting started in his America where he's only got five profiles now, uh, eight in total. So not that many fights, but the, some of the things that he do, I'm like, you know, let me try it. Let me learn from you a little bit. Well, the pot bows a fight. Um, you got clipped was a third round. The beginning of the third round, he got clipped with that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       We'll kick that. Recovery was amazing though, man. That's an amazing recovery mean Barbara was, it puts people out with that shit and your legs completely gave out. But man, that's a weird moment, right, where like anything, if he wasn't near you right, where you could grab a hold of him and take him down if he just stepped back a little bit, you know? Interesting. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was still there. Uh, you know, I never went away. And I think a lot of, even the way I moved it, when somebody showed me that video after I cracked though, I was, I was dying laughing because when I'm in there, I don't, I don't know what happened. You know, I see the video and I see my legs just go see the music is a cup of love of Bro. They ain't pretty good though.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       I've been laughing a lot though all morning. Cause you won. It's funny. It's funny, it's funny, but I think a lot of you see my, a lot of what I was, my focus going into, this one was really on my footwork, uh, my balance, you know, doing yoga. I've been dancing to a little bit. Okay. Awesome. Some ballet. I mean, I, you know, I've heard a lot of guys, look, Loma Chenko was uh, you know, his dad had him enrolled in dance for four fucking years, traditional Russian dancing and he credits that for his foot work. Yeah. I mean I've, I've only been doing it for a short amount of time, but still I can tell right off the bat and I think a lot of what you saw there was that, you know, uh, when I looked at before, the only other fight I've ever got dropped in her hurt seriously was uh, the Leonardo Santos fight.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       And really it was me drop him back on my ankle and I broke my ankle in that fight. When I tried to stand back up, it looked like a wobble to, and that's why John Know John McCarthy stepped in. So a lot of what I focused on was the balance. So when my, you know, that equilibrium gave off and you see how it saw four guys in front of me, I'm just like, let me just keep my eyes on this motherfucker right here. Cause you think of how hard Barboza is usually to take down. You just got you. It was very fortunate that he was right there for you to grab him because he was trying to move in for the kill. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's, if you were his coach, you would have been screaming, get the fuck away from him. Right. His coaches was not doing them no favors by, I felt bad for the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       What do you mean they could, if they could have did them better, uh, through the sec, he, I probably could have put them away in the second row. Um, but he was panicking and I could see it in them, you know, and this coach is like, cause them to panic a little bit more. You know, they just kept screaming at him the time. Like, you only got two minutes to survivor. And I was like, let me not, you know, new Barboza Nice Guy. He really is. And uh, you know, I didn't want to hurt them too bad. That's too very similar fights for him in a row, two mornings in a row. That's, you know, when you're that guy who wants to stand up and you know, you got guys that are just, just constant pressure, constant pressure, know people don't realize how much endurance it takes to move away to you moving backwards.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       It's a lot more difficult to do. Yeah, true. I mean, I feel like it, everything kind of pushed, you know, it's about who controls the pace of the fight. And I felt like I did a good job of that. And again, I, I, I thought even after I got wobbled with the, with the kick and the third, I still came back and ground. Yeah. I tried to make it a point to finish the, in that moment you weren't around, you know, and you heard him bad in the second round, two with a kick to the body. Like you see him cover up and tense in that, but you could see it, it was a strong right kick to the body. One of the reporters he asked me like, why was that standing at at range with them? Uh, and it's just like, I feel like I can do it all, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       And that's my true sense. It's like I can stand at range with with, I mean he's definitely the most explosive dynamic. Uh, all those things that you want to say that the best kicker in the lightweight division and I and I can stand at range with them and kick just as well with them. I can wrestle with the best wrestlers I can. I can kick with the kick best kickbox is, I could punch with the best boxers. So A, why not test myself? I'm not one of these guys who shy away from Shit. He's an interesting case because he's really primarily a kicker. He will throw punches, but that's not his strong suit. I mean, he's not a god that just wants to, you know, just, just digging and throw bombs. Yeah. But he got some bombs hit me with that left. He hit me with a, a Matias left hook and the fifth round I was like, man, he's still there. The kid now, he never gave up. He was taking a beating. He hit me with a Matias left hook. So I gave him one back and buses orbital up. Pretty good plan. Uh, you know, she was still there till the very end. He, he, he can box to eat. He's got some power in his hand. Yeah. And the cut was a pretty nasty cut. Pretty nasty cut over his right eye when it stopped the fight. When you were you shocked that they stop? Nah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       I thought, I thought it was the right call. You know, I think more coaches in MMA to definitely get in there and a little bit sooner. And I think, I think that's what the, some of our problem with his corner was to, uh, you know, you see some of these fights and you can kind of tell when a guy just doesn't, you know, it, it doesn't make sense to make them take more beats. Not somebody like barbels. Barboza is explosive to the very, very end. You have to give that to them. That's the thing. You never know. Right. I mean, if he connected with that left hook, perfect. And you went out and then, and then he's a hero, then you know, I guess you, then you look like the asshole. But uh, you know, I don't know is it's a deadline. Cross.

Speaker 3:          00:18:25       Yeah. It's a tough decision. You don't want to be there when you guys getting beaten up like that and you have to make that call.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, maybe I'm just speaking from, cause I'm not a coach yet. Maybe, you know, my stance will change when him, when I am a coach, but you know, or if I have a coach, but we'll see. Yeah. It's uh, it's,

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       it's different with D. I mean, the same thing with referees and Keith Peterson did a great job in that fight. He's a God that doesn't get enough credit. There's a, there's a few like, you know, Herb Dean, I think because John McCarthy is retired, I think he's the gold standard. Josh Rosenthal, there's a bunch of really, really good guys, but that's a tough call to decide when to stop.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       I think even Yamasaki, you know, Yamasaki takes a lot of, it takes on a lot of bullshit, especially in front of me from, from Dana. Don't like him at all. He ate them. But uh, he, he does a great job in there. Even that, that fight where he let the girl take a lot of punches, a lot of damage. She was still moving. She was still showing that she was in the fight. I think you got to put that on her coaches and her inner trainers. They know that she's, if she's really in there, you know, some guys are just too tough or they aren't good. Like, like Barboza well she was

Speaker 3:          00:19:28       vinyl found shift Cenk coach. It just shits been in there. She just shouldn't have been there and it was awful lot in the first UFC fight and she's fighting a woman who's just a straight up assassin.

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       Yeah. And it can't be on the breath. You can't put it on the ref to know that, you know, or to to make that call. The Rep has to be completely, uh, you know, non, not objective at all. Um, it's, I think it's got to put it on the coaches. They should know what weight do you walk around at about one, if I'm completely just kinda like bullshit and doing whatever I've gotten to as high as like one 95.

Speaker 3:          00:19:59       Uh, when you're in training, like when you get like save your four weeks out where you're at 85 usually when 85, 85, eight, you're cutting a lot of weight man. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a, do you see yourself ever moving to 70 or

Speaker 2:          00:20:12       [inaudible] 70 necessarily? Just because though those guys there at that point you're talking about a frame issue, right. You know, you got guys had like six foot one and you know, they're, they're just, it's a, it's a different, it's a different body style. I trained with a lot of them. High level welterweights tool, you knows, it's a different body style that I'm more suited for one 55. It's just, you know, some of the things that I got to play around with I think will keep happening in the upcoming months. I didn't project that I would fight again until July or so. So a lot of the things that I was doing diet wise was kind of getting to that and they approached me with this barbells, a fight

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       maybe like eight weeks earlier than that. So I just had to do with that and to do so is it a matter of just you didn't taper off quick enough or you just came in too heavy before you started? You know, it was just, it was just the timing wise. You know, I missed it by one pound. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's some non that time and that I, that I've really got to figure out. And that was the biggest problem with, with the, uh, Tony Ferguson fight. Uh, you know, I can break it down for you. It, so usually, uh, you know, I'm normally about one 85 through six weeks of diet and I can usually die it down until about 76 77. That's where I'm optimal. Uh, and then from there I start their water cuts. So the week of the fight, the Tuesday, I'm 76, uh, you know, I saved that all the way until, you know, I overload my body with water and you know, cause a flush out some of the sodium and the carbs and all that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       Um, I saved the rest of that up until the day before and I try and cut as much as I can as he has. I want to spend as little time dehydrated that dehydrated as possible. And I think that's some of the problem with having these early morning Wayans is the timing issue of it as you wake up and then you have to start from the time you wake up rather than if it's at four o'clock in the afternoon and like it used to be, you'd be able to do it all throughout the day. Yeah, yeah. I can cut more, you know, reasonably through the morning, you know, you can wake up whenever you had more time, you would have been able to make it. Oh yeah, absolutely. 1%. Yeah. My body was, I got confused when they were doing this early morning wins. I thought you had like like from 8:00 AM to four o'clock right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       Yeah. I thought if you could weigh in early, go ahead way in early. But they gave you the time. Yeah, I mean I, I'm not really, I don't really know the solution either. You know? I don't think nobody really knows the solution to that problem, the, the timeframe because you are seeing a lot of guys miss weight because of that and I think that's, that's one of the biggest problems and not only that, but guys are going asleep completely dehydrated and sleeping through the night, 20 pounds, the hydrated, that's a lot of water coming from your blood. Your blood gets thicker, your heart rate slows down when you, when you sleep. I mean, you know, I try my best not to spend as much time dehydrated as possible. So it's just a timing issue on that last one. Especially when you see guys like those on Joe's that just can't do it anymore and he goes up to 70 he looks better than ever.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       What do you think about that? It is, it's always an option for me. It would be an option now, like I, I would, I would entertain the right fight at it for sure. It's just right now at, at the state of it is, you know, they're doing this bullshit interim title and you know, Tyron sitting right there and just, it's a lot of movement. It's not a lot of movement at the top right now. So one 55 just more fights interests me. It's bigger challenges. I think the guys are honestly better at one 55 one 70 maybe in a future, but you know, it's gotta be the right type of fight or something. Yeah. Well there's so many good fighters now from, I mean, you go all across the board. I mean pretty much every week class. It's strong now. But yeah, I agree. I think 55 is probably the strongest way class right now and it's, and it's so strong that you can make a one 65 I don't mean, I don't, I really don't see what the holdup is on it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       Do a 65 to a 75 because we have so many guys that can bounce between those. And you'll have a whole new top 15 whole new champion in the be just as strong as any of the two weight classes next to it. I couldn't agree more. I think it's very important that we spread it out better. I think 10 pounds is reasonable then. I mean the way boxing has it, they just, you know, they have a 54 and then they have a 60 that seems a little ridiculous. 47 and then they have a 54 I think you'd be better off with 10 just said straight up 10 pounds. That's reasonable. But when you go from like 85 to two oh five, that shit's crazy. Big Boys. What's up big? Some of them to even 55 to 70 because most guys, uh, you know, like a normal sized guy, he's about my size, 180 590 pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       That puts you in that, in that middle, you know, you got guys like me with a lot of muscle where I'm not going to lose a lot of fat in between. You know, even for this one, I was one 77, but I was four and a half percent body fat. You know, I couldn't really lean. He can't get too much more lean in that uh, uh, 64 and a half. Somebody fighting when you wait in. Yeah. Before, well I was four and a half percent maybe two weeks before the fight actually. But are you getting calipers? Are you doing the how they, how they tested in over at the few in the water? Not all over it. The Pi they have. Especially the scanning. Yeah. They've got like, so the scales aren't that good yet. Here's the thing about those scales, those scales when you hold onto those things and some of them are okay, but the best way they say is submerging you.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       There's a submerge one and there's another one that uses some sort of like electricity thing, like you lying in a bed and then I think the performance institute has that too. There explain that shit to me. Yeah. Yeah. The, the, the, the full scanner. Yeah. I've done that a few times, but it's much quicker, much easier. Just to get on the scale and as long as it's real low, four and a half percent sounds a does. But as long as it's, it's uh, still the same measurement. You know what I'm saying? As my last fight for the Tony Fight, I was five and a half percent on. So as long as it's in the same with the same calipers, I mean they're using, you know that you're basically on point. Yeah, exactly. I can compare it at least. Uh, but again I can't get much that much leaner.

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       You know, it's mostly just going to come out of water. If they added 65, then you know, I, I've got 10 more pounds of water that I don't have to cut out. Fucking ridiculous. How frustrating was it for you going into that Tony Ferguson fight with that staph infection because that was a, that was a serious fall. I didn't notice it at the weigh ins but then the moment you walked into the cage, it was funny man because they were telling DC don't talk about it cause I was going that staff that that is fucking staff. And then they said to DC, don't talk about it. He goes, Yup, that looks like staff to me. He just ignored him. He was like, fuck you. That's that man. I don't know why they didn't want anybody breaking it up because it's an important point. It's an unfortunate thing that happens during training sometimes.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       Yeah. Eight a, I kind of noticed him on a Sunday, you know, and then Tuesday we do the check ins and everything and uh, I had the girl, I'm like, ew, you know, put some makeup on it because I didn't want nobody to find out. And even Tony, you know, I, if he would have saw it, he would have no, he knew our compromise all that. Um, but yeah, it frustrated things. They make things a lot more complicated. It put me, it made the weight cut terrible. Uh, just to go back to it, I mean, I'm cutting from 76 to to fifties. I had to be 55 for that fight and I try my best to skim it down, uh, in about 12 hours. So I woke up at 5:00 AM with at about one 62. Uh, and Wayne's are between nine and 11. Um, and from 5:00 AM til 8:00 AM I had only cut one pound compare to in other cuts that have gone really well.

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       I'll normally cut by four or five pounds in that time. But because I, I just was feeling good and I wasn't worried about it. And thus, and I was using the same temperature of water, I was using the same everything, but the staff may my body hold onto the water. So when I went down and checked and saw that it was still like five pounds up with like two hours ago, they started like throwing a boiling hot water on me to get my botany. Yeah. To give me sweat and to get it off. It was brutal. That's a for, for know for someone who doesn't, never, never experienced staff. Explain what it does to your body. Yeah. It makes it feel the next day I just, I felt so tired. I never felt as tired in my life. And it felt, I felt so tired to the point where I tried to counteract it by getting myself as pumped as I can.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       And the, you know, would you normally get there two hours before the fight? When I walked into the arena that night, two hours before I was in a sweat, you know, my body was like full of adrenaline. Like I wasn't taking any medication. You weren't going on in antibiotics. He figured I do have to decide whether you should take antibiotics and then, you know, that compromises your endurance for sure. Or just let your body fight it off. I had it before, so I had been on the antibiotics and they just make terrible, you know, if you've ever been through it, I mean, it's a terrible feeling. So I'd just like, you know what, I think I can just push through it and I'm young and I was like, fuck it. Let's just go like, did you try any like a natural remedies?

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       You know, it wasn't a whole lot I could take, cause I also got to cut the weight still. Uh, there's not some topical stuff that, one of the things they say that works really well, topical, believe it or not is mince garlic. Very Long. Garlic apparently has a tremendous effect on staph infections. I was swallowing whole cloves of ginger. I remember I would take ginger, I would chop it up and I'll swallow it to see if that would do some, but it's hard. Yeah, it's a heart. There's a lot other cause. Some real strong antibacterial properties and one of the people that have been on the podcast many times Doctor Rhonda Patrick said she, she had dealt with some persistent staph infection and she had like a, you know, hole in her skin and what she did was she took garlic and packed it into that hole.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       Jen and fucking killed it. I mean Jesus, I wish I would've known that before. I just kind of just fought through it. I was like, fuck it. I'm just going to defense soap makes some really good stuff for that too. They make us these essential oils. It's tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil and you put it on like right where they have an issue. Where were you in in October would have been there for anybody else there that has that staff. Anytime you have any sort of a ring warm or staff or anything, there's some natural stuff. Not like some bullshit homeopathic nonsense, but some actual real natural stuff that can help you. And Defense soap specializes in that because a guy sacco, the guy who owns the company, he is, you know, coaches wrestling and deals with kids that always have ringworm and staph infection.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       So she can, he came out with these soaps. He's natural soaps that are just designed for grapplers. That's why it's called defense soap. No. And then I'll have him send you some and then the essential oils and balms and stuff like ointments for scratches and shit like that. So they don't get infected. That's, you know, Jim's, it's, you're always getting an infected. Yeah. And that's it. That was one of the biggest focuses of this canvas. Like make sure I stay healthy because they, if you don't have your health, you don't have nothing. And that was what it was at that Tony fight and it's just, it, it became something I didn't want to. It was such a big event and it was my first real big event to a that I just wanted it all just to go ride and go over. But it ended up being just a lot of my, by the staff originally.

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       I think it came from mental stress, you know, it, it was so many stresses going on, you know, you really sure. Yeah. And you look at the three biggest stressors, you know, I was going through a divorce and I had just moved into a house. You look at those in a normal day to day life that though those are like the two biggest stressors, you can have a then to add on fighting for a world title in six weeks. So I'm just like, oh, that's fucking go. Like I was like, you know, I wasn't expecting to, I was thinking maybe a, they was gonna give me Tony, but maybe in December. Indeed and in Detroit or if something like that, but he was like six weeks. I was like, hi, what fog does, right. They were thinking about doing you in Detroit. Right. That was a, that was, that was the talk.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       And you were requesting a big fight in Detroit? Yeah, yeah. That's where all my life, you know, every year I kind of Chore Plan Out my year and a and a, and I got my vision in my head. I got to call them water bulls in there. That was one of them. But yeah, it ended up putting a little bit too much stress on me all at once and I took on a lot for that one. But you did learn, tell you what man, when you took him down and mounted him and the first round I was like Holy Shit. Cause I know how good Tony is on the ground. You know, it's interesting because you don't, you look at someone when they fight, and this is one of the things that I've been saying about Khabib. Um, it's because it's so hard because he's doing what people do, right?

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       He's taking people down this mountain and grounding, pounding. But he's doing it to people that other people can't do it too. And he's doing it in a way that it's like, wow, how good is this motherfucker like when he was mall and Michael Johnson, I was like, how fucking good is he? Cause this is crazy. Like he's in that moment several better than anybody. Michael had fought before on the ground. And when I'm seeing you first of all see the chaos of fight in right to this day, I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ. Just let them go out. Let them go out. And we would have known, but that minor controversy from that moment, you've got to fully locked in rear naked choke. And he still conscious. Let them go out. He doesn't want to tap. Let 'em go out. He, he was going lip. He was maybe but let them go out. But you know the fit is it, you can't, you can't some guys 10 but the thing is what you're saying, but I know Hixon camp. Yeah. But the thing is that the ref, you can't put that on a Rep. You know, it's defend yourself and Ted Intelligent Mario was that Mario, Mario. But it's, it's defend yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       Defend yourself intelligently. It all, you can't, you can't say I'm blocking punches with my face until the guy gets tired, you know, you can't say, oh, I'm just going to try to sleep in this choke. The guy trying to concentrate on his neck and just completely tensed up his neck and try to push blood through. I've seen guys do that. I know. I feel you, but only to a point, right. Only to a point. Right. And then you go to sleep, go to sleep. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm with you. He could have let them go. But uh, I think as soon as he, as soon as Mario saw that his hands went from fighting the hands to doing this, Mario stopped it. I mean, and, and I thought it was a good stop. I mean, it's not a bad stop it as such, but it was controversial.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       You can call it odd things. Controversy's always good. I said that right after, like keep it up, keep it going. Like I love it. They got you to talk about it. So about, this is an undercard fight, but it became like bigger even then a lot of the other fights on the car because of the, yeah, yeah. No, no, we uh, we headlined that, that event, you know, that wasn't, it wasn't, I thought that was like a paper view. That's right. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry it's doing my thing. But that fight was really like a top contender for mean chaos. Uh, had been on a roll. He's very strong on the ground, which is one of the reasons why it was so impressive that you took his back and choked him like that. Yeah. I mean, I think I have a different style than, than, uh, a lot of people can see, you know, you, you, you go back to Khabib and, and all this.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       I like, his style is, it's good. It's obviously very good, but I can see a lot of holes in it. And I saw those holes many years ago. I've been called how big could beat for years I've been wanting to fight them just because people got those questions. I've got those questions too. So I'm like, let's see what this motherfucker got like, because I see it, I see them hoes, you know, I don't really focus on too much of the good. I'm like, what holes? I got that boy number. I'll tell you what are the holes? What do you see it, you know, even though some of his take on a lot of his takedowns, he, he misses a lot of them. You know, he's very square. He kinda just bum rushes. You know, people were talking about the Barboza fight before and they're like, are you looking at that fight and you're going to try and build off that one? I'm like, yeah. I mean he did okay. The fight was good. He'd beat the hell out of Barboza, but I saw the holes in it. You know, he's just running a square for

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Adam, you know, he's, he got hit with a lot of shots. I didn't see it for people in the outside watching him because the way he just came forward on Barboza was like, he was indestructable

Speaker 3:          00:35:48       it didn't matter. I'm just going to get you. It's just a matter of time. Keep throwing your kicks. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. Ooh, I got you.

Speaker 2:          00:35:54       You got those guys. But the body gives up. You know you got Justin Gates, you as the same way the body will give up and met with you. You can't keep putting your body on the line like that. I mean, if he wants to run at me square four square like that, that's what I'm getting paid.

Speaker 3:          00:36:09       I'm getting paid. Oh sorry. I love the, I love watching him fight, but part of me is like Jesus man, just if he mixed what he can do, cause he's one of the very best at leg kicks and close that too, to be in the middle of a combination like chest to chest with you and then somehow or another he whips a leg kick straight down on your leg. I mean, he's nasty with that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       He's, he's got a couple of things that he does real good. You know, I, I've been studying get you too. He's just, he, he's just hardheaded than him. He like, he don't, he don't care.

Speaker 3:          00:36:37       We'll take it. Yeah. He'll just take it and just walk right into it. But it's, it seems like we, when you look at all the skills that he has, like that would be better represented with some movement and some foot work and some other things.

Speaker 2:          00:36:49       Yeah. Especially with a guy like Trevor Whitman in this morning and you know, Trevor's a great, great coach. He did the rose. He's been there. I think their styles are, are very opposite. Uh, you know, he should probably listen to him a little bit more, like a, even one of the things with me and Robert Falls, you know, I had been with brother Robert was the, the pretty much the only reason why I moved to Vegas, uh, because he, there's a, there's a weird bond between a, like a fighter and a coach, you know, and, and he just got me more than any other coach before or, or since we'll, you know, uh, we were very different, but he just understood me as an athlete a little bit more. And even some of the things that he would tell me, I wouldn't listen to it. Like he, you know, maybe like, you know, he tried to tell me to stay smart and, you know, not bra, because at the end of the day, Joe, I could, I'm like, fuck this, I'm a fight.

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       You know, I'm a buy down on my mouthpiece. He tried to get me to be smarter. Uh, and just some of the things that he would say to me resonated way more than anybody else. So I think now that he's gone, I've put what he said, it's still in my head and it, you know, I try and follow it even more now, you know? Uh, and I, I wish somebody like gates you wouldn't listen because, you know, Whitman is telling them what to do, the right thing to do. He should, he should probably listen to him.

Speaker 3:          00:38:14       Well, I think Trevor just tries to compliment your style and gauge you styles. Just savage. He's just, he's just

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       going to war. We're going to war every time you go to war. I guess I get it. Yeah. But you know, I watch, I think you can, I think you'd learn from learning from somebody else, you know, I think everybody has what they do that that's like say I, I try and create a strong team around me where everybody has what they do and I'm just going to try and listen to him, you know, and, and even more so now it's not, I understand that a little bit more as I'm getting older and you know, going through life too with it. I said, well rob, you know what, one of the, one of the reporters there, he asked me, he was like, we seen you in there talking and they thought I was talking to Barboza. Uh, but I was really just talking to myself like I was saying things that he would say or the Robert.

Speaker 2:          00:39:05       Yeah. Robert was saying, and I'm saying them to myself and I guess my mouth was moving. I don't really know. I thought it was in my head the whole time, but, uh, I guess like some of the reporters could see it. Uh, but you know, I really tried to make that a focus on. Interesting. So do you do that in sparring too? Uh, I don't, I don't know. I usually try. And did you realize you were doing it until they brought it up? I didn't realize. I know and not because he, when he asked me that, it kind of caught me off guard because I remember in the fight I'm, I'm very cerebral. I, I, I remember everything about it. Uh, but I remember I was going to say something to Barboza to, you know, I talking my shit, you know, I do it in quite some time to time, but it didn't cause he was a nice guy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       I didn't realize that I was talking to myself too on it. Even. So you were just kind of going through the things that you wanted to focus on in the fight while it was happening and like stay, you're saying even the kick, the kick that he landed, if you see like a microsecond before that I was nodding my head because I was, I was, I took my mind off them for a split second. I saw the knock out there, I seen him dip to his left and I'm like, oh, next time he did, so I'm, I'm about to get it. So I started to talk and I was like, ah. I like, I got this and I took my mind off of him and he hit me with that fucking spin. But what it should have said was stay sharp, you know, stay, stay focused.

Speaker 2:          00:40:24       Like that's what I was saying in the fourth and the fifth round after that kick landed, I was like, stay sharp. Stay focused on him. I'm just saying that to myself because that's what Robert told me. He wouldn't tell me to look for the knockout. What was the thought process when you're going to face a guy like Barboza that's such a dangerous kicker. Was it a lot of faints plus pressure? Like what was the thought process about getting close to him with a guy like Barboza, he throws everything so hard and so explosive. I knew I was going to have to eat some of that, uh, and just keep pushing forward and just not take my eyes off of him. Even when I got wobbled and I was wrong, I just try not take my eyes off of him, you know, with, with a, with a guy like that, that's such a great athlete. Uh, which is what I considered Barboza as you know, rob had these three things. He put everybody in an athlete, a competitor or fighter category, and Barboza was like apitomy of an athlete. Uh, but with that, you can't show him no, you can't show him that he's doing good. You know what I'm saying? So every time you was stolen, and I'm just like, that fucking switch kick is ridiculous. He's got the most ridiculous, which kicking the game so fast, Mark Della Grotto, who's seen some of the best of the best fight in Thailand, in,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       in real, you know, in life. And like right there in person, he said, I've never seen a guy with a faster switch kick. He was even the top, the most elite of the ties. He goes, that's the fastest way. Everyone's saying they're tired tire. I'm, I beat the hell out of him. And he was still thought, I was like, how is this even possible to even in the third and fourth round swap? And some of it, I'm kind of like looking while I'm in there, I'm like, what is he doing that can make him do that? You know? Uh, I try and steal a little bit from every guy that a fight especially, and I'm like, what is he doing as allowing him to be that Goddamn fast with it? But you know, I prepare, I prepare with a lot of high level kickboxers that, you know, they got that style, that kicking it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       Just kick it fucking block off if you let them. Yeah. You're going to get something from that. Right? Like the little [inaudible] calls it the rub and then your fight. Someone's real good. You get that rub from him, from him. You just realize now, oh, those kids could come at you that fast. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and, and you get that in a lot of different ways. Uh, like, like with Tony, you know, Tony did a lot of things in there that I didn't expect and I didn't, you know, didn't really plan for it. It's only so much planning that you can do until you get in there and you need that experience to rely back on. And I feel like that's what I'm building up at a young age. Even. It's possible for you to rematch with Tony Ain't got to get touch with Tony now coming off of that very disappointing fall, you know when he was, which is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       I feel bad for her to do say something to, this is very important. And I actually have pictures too. I'm going to send them to you right now, Jamie. So we could put it online because uh, everybody was repeating the, the, the thought that he had worn sunglasses. Um, and that's why he fell down, um, that he was wearing sunglasses, his little AP wearing them little misspoke. He misspoke. And he said it too. I think he said my prescription sunglasses to Ariel Helwani. I think that's what they were saying. The square ones that he wears a, I'll send it. I'm going to send it to Jamie right now, but it wasn't, but he was probably wearing sunglasses. No photos. Totally. I'll find it. God Damn it. Tony loves those songs. I know. He does love the, okay. I know where it is. Um, he does love the sunglasses.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       Don't, he's a smart guy. You know, I, I don't, I don't, I don't hold that against him. He was probably something that was already injured in his leg and I feel bad for the guy and I really do. I don't think you'll ever be the same. Coming back off that one. The, that's a big, you know, I hear detached. It detached them for the loan. I mean, that's huge. Especially at 34 to try and come back off that that's it's going to, and it kind of sucks for me too, because I think I fought the best. Tony Ferguson that you're going to see a period. Really? You think so? Because it was before that injury. Yeah. I don't think he's going to be the same again after any, he'll come back and he'll still beat a great guys. You know, he's still, he's still going to do very good. But you know, I don't think it be the same. And you know,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       dammit, I got this photo in here somewhere. I'm going to find it. I can't find it. I'll send it to you later. But in the photo he's wearing glasses. He's not wearing per se. He's not wearing prescription sunglasses. He said he misspoke and said prescription sunglasses. That's why Dana told me Shane is ruthless. Dana goes, everybody who wears sunglasses should have inside should have that happen.

Speaker 4:          00:44:56       This is after this huge fight fell apart. What probably about right dude. It was funny though. Yeah. But um,

Speaker 3:          00:45:04       it wasn't, he wasn't wearing sunglasses.

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       Yeah. I mean I just want to clear it up for Tony that I, like I say, I mean I, I feel bad for them. I really do. I think the good news is you can come back from that injury. That's an injury. You can come back at 34 especially with the way he trains. I mean, I think he, I think the body can come back. It's just, I don't know if his mind will let him be as free as it. That was one of Tony's biggest assets to the style is he was, I mean, he just does whatever the fuck he wants, you know? And now when he gets back in here, is he going to be thinking about, is knee, even if that's in the back of your mind, it's still, it's, it's limited on that type of style that he, that he likes to fight

Speaker 3:          00:45:38       maybe, or maybe you just fucking with his head right now.

Speaker 4:          00:45:44       He planted some seeds. Kevin Lee, you never know. Here's some money to be made. Joe. I gotta be, I gotta get it. I understand it

Speaker 3:          00:45:52       be out for quite a while. I would imagine he won't be able to even really train hard for six months.

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       Yeah. At least. At least. Yeah. He's at least a year or so. Uh, I'll, I'll, I'll let us send me when I look at that and I see that fight and just, you know, how much different shit could be now. You know, uh, head I went into that fight healthy. Especially I think the, the entire division would look different, but I'm a correct all that in a little bit. Let me, let me get my hands. Oh, could be first. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:17       Well it's interesting me, you're in the running now for sure. And before this fight, I think you were a slight underdog in the Barboza fight. Yeah. But after that domination, I mean, you, you for sure more moved up and you're in the running now 100%. So you got poor Yay. Who just looked real good against Gagey and won that fight after getting his legs chewed up. Yup. Um, and then you've got, but you know, poor Yay of course was knocked out by Michael Johnson. And then you've got you coming off of the loss to Tony Storm the gates with this fight. And then you've got Eddie Alvarez who look great against Justin Gagey that it's very hot. Yeah. And Connor is going to jail.

Speaker 4:          00:46:57       Wait, who knows what's happened?

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       I think that's the x factor is what's happening. What Kotter. Yeah. Uh, I mean Dustin is out there. He, he, but I just don't see, no, I'm speaking as it from a fan. You know, I just don't see no, uh, upsize today. You know what I mean? To you fighting him? No, no, no. To, to, to him make a beep. I mean, they can make it happen and it can be, we'll go out there and he'll smoke them. I mean, they should be real here, but uh, I just don't see many fans getting behind that. Just from what does [inaudible] bring to the table that could be made already seen. This is big fight right

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       now. I mean, just being completely honest, the big fire right now is Khabib and con 100% sure. That's the big fight. Whatever. Take five or either Madison Square Garden. I mean, they, they can, they can make that happen. I don't think New York has ever letting that mother fucker fuck there again. I just don't think they're going to do that. They don't play games, man. Then athletic commissions, a different commission and they're new to MMA and that was embarrassing for them. I mean him throwing the fucking Dolly and the fact that they let them get in there with all his boys and the whole thing was just so thuggish and didn't, the thing at Bella [inaudible] happened in was that in New York? In New Jersey, what thing happened in Beltour where he, where he went over and slap Goddard and audit a cop. People bitches and hoes and it was that, I want to say that was an Ireland or England.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       Was it an Ireland? I think it was in England. I want to say it was in London. Wasn't that the bell toward London Card? I don't know. But that got her thing was crazy. I felt like that happened. Don't on the east coast too, but I mean if that was one, neither waist too. It's like he just keeps fucking up with this kind of stuff and and you know, no one's saying get rid of him, you know, he's just, he's worth so much money. It's really fascinating. What I was saying is, imagine if Ray Borg and him switch sides. If Ray pour it showed up with all his boys and was screaming and yelling and through a Dolly at the window. It's done. Done deal for. Yeah. Ray Paul Daley. Paul Daley must be at home going, hey, look, it's starting phase. It's certain things that we just, Kay, do you know Paul, I'm sorry, until you get to that stratosphere that Conor McGregor, it's like there's so much money to be made.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       That's the problem. It's like the rules get Bet Paul Paul Daley was, did was throw a punch as he was Josh Koscheck after it didn't even connect. That could have been sorted out. Yeah. And you even heck, I was like, we'll Brooks kinda got the hammer put down on them. Dinny uh, after he got knocked out and then push the ref. Uh, I think what that will Brooks, I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know. You're looking at me funny on it. I'm thinking, right. It was somebody, you know, he got knocked out and then push the rep right out there and it's like they put a lot on. Oh No, it wasn't well books. I'm sorry it was a god. What's that many ponder. Hmm. I know who you're talking about. God dammit. Who was that? God, this is going to kill me. Sorry. Yeah. And they held them against him and he was concussed.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       You know, you didn't know. You barely know where you at. He said, Jason, I it's, that's what it was. Yeah. See, great fighter too. He's a very good fighter and when people don't understand is that once you get knocked out and then you come back, you really don't know what happened. You're, you're really out of it. Yeah. Who knocked him out? It was no soft gels. Right. So Angelo's welterweight debut, right? 55 still. She had 55 still. Yeah. Yeah. But again, he was great fighter on me. It's just certain things that, oh, well we just can't do Jo. We meaning people of color. I don't want to say it that way. They can do it though. I do think it's people with that there's a level to the game where you are so valuable that you like if Conor McGregor does a pay per view fight, especially if they do, you heard all that crazy nonsense they're going to do with Mcgregor. Like no shoes. You can clinch but no kicks, no take downs. Know if they ever did that. Greg going to digital printing money, printing money, but so hard for them to not take that money. But

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       I mean, and it, and I don't hold that against them. And I always said that about the UFC. Do you see about the green? And I, and I understand that and uh, that's kind of where I'm coming from it from, but he, you know, it's just consistency. Yeah. Well you, I think you just have to realize as a, as a, as a black man in America really, like there's two ways to approach the situation. You need to be the victim or you can just say it is what it is. That some circumstances, you know, uh, by people just don't support other black people to way to iris support the Irish, the Russia support. I mean, I'm just being real with you. That's

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       reality is white people in America don't support white Americans the way the Irish support Connor, nobody does 100% and it's an American thing. I mean when he was fighting, when he was fighting Mayweather, did you see the fucking, the people that were in Mandalay bay, which wasn't even where the was taking place, the entire place was flooded with people singing together.

Speaker 2:          00:51:53       When he fought dust import. Yay. At one 78 they kept me up all for, I was on the undercard it up by, it kept me up all fucking night sitting in the MGM. They were running up and down the, the, the, the halls of the MGM leads. The security couldn't stop them. I mean they had to crazy to rabbit, but that's, that's what's gonna. I mean obviously he had a great performance is on top of it for sure. But that definitely helps. You know what I mean? When your first fight in the UFC debut is in Boston. Nick going crazy for you like that. You just don't see that much. Uh, and it's sad. Really. Uh, you, you talk about Floyd Mayweather, really how Floyd got big like that is he had to go against the Mexicans and you know, he had to get them to really hate them in order to get big.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Exactly, yes. But that's also his style. Whereas Connor style's very different cause he knocks guys dead. It's a different style. You know, like may remember when Tyson was in his prime, you knew no one was kind of beat them. It was just, you're waiting to see the executions where you were just a little boy at the time. Probably weren't even born. My pops was like, what time were you born in [inaudible] 92. Yeah. See Jesus Christ, you missed everything. Well, my positive, they used my title. I'm a huge boxing fan, so you know, I go back, I would have 92. That's a huge boxing fan. Yeah. Just all of these, the UFC actually, so that's crazy right. It pretty much a year after you were born. It started. Yeah man. But the Tyson days, he was the biggest paper you draw it, but it was really just, you were watching an execution and there was also like, people were thinking like, man, is this going to be worth it? How long has this one going to last?

Speaker 2:          00:53:22       He's still, but he's still, he was, he had to be the a little bit, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       and that's the every, and it, I mean, I, it sucks to say it was just like every real big black fighter. Is it usually the villain, you know, and, and that, that's the way that it was not, but that's not American. He's, and he's British. That's different, you know, he's totally different. Totally different. Totally different atmosphere. And I mean, this was the last time we had a really loved African American fighter in America. I mean, they're there, they're out there. I mean, for sure people love roadshows. Peter Jones love. And people love Muhammad Ali after, uh, you know, but even Roy Johnson Shit for being cocky. Oh, for sure. Because he was so dominant. But that's the culture though. You gotta be cocky. You gotta be, you gotta be all those things. Like even the way I talk a lot of shit. But that's just, that's just because that's the culture.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       Like that's what I do. I mean, well, it's also an effective mind, mind games strategy, like a guy who's talking shit to you. It makes you more anxious, more nervous, more emotions, more everything. Certain guys, you know, there's certain guys that you can play that too. Like I said, everybody's got like those three categories, you know, with athletes, especially athletes and competitors, you know, they Kinda, you know, get more shooken up by stuff like that. Fall fire ideas. He don't give a fuck. Like, he likes me. I like it a little bit more. Connor, you could tell he likes it a little bit more. Uh, it gets my mind off the actual fight itself because that's what we grew up like talking shit, you know, so it's, some guys do, it rattles them. You know, the best I've ever seen the best response to someone.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       Shit-Talking Rose Nama. Eunice. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She, she massive, full dark master full. She went like that like a month. I'm a huge role is fair. She's, yeah, she's dope. Might be the best looking girl in the UFC. And she shaves her fucking head and never wears makeup. She doesn't give a fuck. I mean it's crazy. Yeah. And she, I mean, and a phenomenal, phenomenal fighter. I, but just when she was standing in front of Yolanda and she was citing the Lord's prayer, gangster man coming to get you and the boogie man and she's like, our father in heaven, hallowed be thy name of gangster shit. You ever light? It's like crazy. She made me nervous. I'm a big fan of next door. That's where the thing with, uh, you know, people look at my style even of the way I promoted her and all the talk fights and, you know, Talk Shit or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       Uh, but there's so many ways to do it. You know, there's so many ways to like entertain at hit, have fun with it. You don't always have to be almost smack the shit out of your Mama and all that. Right. You know, it's, there's so many different ways you get, you can not say anything. It'd be come off just as fucking is. You know the dude this screaming from across the room with there is a pressure, right? Isn't there a pressure on fighters to sal and hype fights to talk a lot of shit. I mean, you see seen Colby Covington taking it off the deep end. He goes, he goes so crazy. I don't even think they let him go to Brazil. Like when I heard he was gonna Fight Dos Anjos

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       in Brazil, I was like, no, Colby. I was thinking of reaching out and telling people like to call it, bring your own water, whatever you do. I mean, I guess he's doing his thing. He, he's still winning fights. Yeah. So at the end of the day, that's what really matters is that he's winning fights. But yeah, I mean that's got us talking about him. He's got us talking about that too. But that style on me is, is that should get played out and you could just, you could just tell it when it, when it's forced is not good. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:56:53       He just goes, he goes against people. He doesn't have to, like, he was talking some shit about Jon Jones. Jon Jones will smack you in your fucking face and there's not much you're going to be able to do about it. One day you might be in front of him and then when are you going to do, you know, I mean just that you're not even fighting Jon Jones. Why you talking Shit about John?

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       Yeah. I don't make any sense. I don't know a couple people, even even females, like he started to, I mean, I guess he's, he, he's just trying to get the noise running or whatever. I just think it's so many different ways to do it. That's, that's like the most primitive way of, you know, kind of trying to sell yourself and sell a fight. It's like so many ways. Like even me, like I came up with a lot of the shit that I started doing it. I just like kind of came up with, you know, like in the moment. Yeah. Just, well before the, the, the, the, the first big one was the [inaudible] thing, you know, where I kind of hit him at the press conference. Uh, but going into that, my mindset wasn't like all let me, you know, talk as much shit as I can about them, you know, or let me, you know, jump up and down and all this, you know, it just was, I did have that I wanted to stand out, not necessarily that I want to entertain. I just was like, I'm on, I wanted to stay. I'm sitting behind fucking Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier like I'm like a kid in a candy store, you know? Uh, so I just, I wanted to stand out as much as possible. And you know,

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       now the dom had a few of these big fights, right? The Kia sulfite was a high profile fight and then of course the 25 was a very high profile. And then this last Barboza fight was a real big fight. Do you feel like now you've like settled more into the fact that not only do you do, do you belong here, you deserve to be here, but you're more comfortable being here.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       Yeah, there's a, there's that saying like the fake it till you make it hyper real, like that's not a joke in it.

Speaker 3:          00:58:40       When did you feel like you were fee? We obviously you would never really faking it because you were winning fights.

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       I exaggerate. It is her, you know, like I exaggerated shorty, this shit. Like I was having fun with it, but I was kind of learning on the job too because like doing interviews and stuff like that, it takes some, it's, it's hard to get to your level. Like you are very likely I listen to your show all the time. Like I love it. Thank you. But you are like very good at it, you know? And it takes a long time to do that. I had to kind of learn on the job. So yeah, I would exaggerate a little bit too much here and there. But, uh, the fake it till you make it thing like I think it's a lot of people hear that and they like take it, take it like negatively all the time. You know, I always heard that not to get positive, you know, uh, I've read George Saint Pierre his book and he talked about that a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       He texted me two days before this fight with Barboza and he was talking about, you know, giving me some tips and pointers and all that. But the last thing he said to me was, you know, you're going to have that fear when you go before you go in there, but once you get in there, your body's just going to turn the autopilot. Just fake it till you make it fake the confidence until you make it. That's how he approaches it. That's interesting. That's interesting. Fight. What it was is like I said, going into that press conference especially, I wanted it to stand out and through the rest of my life in Detroit especially, I was always taught like, don't stand out as much as you can. Like I was like, I was like stay low and keep moving. Chill. Like keep your head now like that, you know, don't focus business businesses, done folks, business, you know, I always stayed on what I'm doing, you know, always kind of had a vision, always had to go.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       So it, my opposite was to stand out so I had to kind of fake it till I am not necessarily fake it till you make it, fake it til I became it, you know what I'm saying? And I think it was right after the Tony fight where I was like maybe the two months it took me to get over it. At that moment I was like, man, I really like to have that confidence to to, you know, I do have like, I don't have to fake it. You know what I'm saying? The Tony that Tony Fight, I mean your, your podcast too. I mean you'll park has, has been huge to me. I mean this and it's, it's hard for me to really explain it. You know, when me just growing up, like I didn't have a lot of confidence, you know, like people see me and see me in interviews and they just think that just, that's how it was.

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       But I would lose a lot of my wrestling matches as a kid just because I thought that, and this might like alienator alienates some people and it might sound like off, but it's just the way I grew up is the white boys above eight mile, you know, they got the money that they're working harder than you, they're better than you. So that was kind of like my mentality kind of. Even when I started wrestling and like these kids start wrestling with your five, I started wanting to 16 and they just would beat me and then be like, I couldn't even, I wouldn't even really compete with them, you know, it took me to go to college, uh, B because I, that was my first real explosion of white people. That's how, like I obviously knew white people went out to get, you know, we the teachers and stuff, you know, but nobody around my same age, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       So when I got around and there, there's one school in particular, Detroit Catholic Central, they were number one school in, in, in Michigan at the time, but they were, uh, so in Detroit, every mile is, is numbered. I was born and raised pretty much all seven mile, eight mile is like the divider between the suburbs and the city. These kids were like on 26 miles. So they were like, wait, he'll tell like with, you know, rich regional are, uh, so I just, I don't know, for some reason I just didn't have the confidence. Uh, but when I got around them and I started living in kind of training together every day and I realized, I'm like, we all the same, you know, like he works as just as hard as I can see him every day, you know, he's, I see him going, it's a class and I see them going through it too.

Speaker 2:          01:02:39       Is Allison it that moment gave me the confidence to be like, okay, I can't compete with them. W W W with other people, you know, I can't compete with anybody. Really. Your podcast was like the next step to that, you know, that was me at the collegiate level. The of the first podcast I heard from you was the Lance Armstrong one. And I was like, this is like world level, you know? And when I hear him talking, I hear him talk so candidly and I'm like, oh, he's just a normal dude. You know what I mean? He's just, I guess in my head I didn't have that before. You know? And it's like we all the same and that really has allowed me to go over to Ireland and compete to go down to Brazil and get Pete to, to fight the best kick boxer in the world and not have that and still had that same confidence. You know what I'm saying? Right.

Speaker 3:          01:03:23       I see what you're saying. Like you just hearing people talk and realizing that we're all just human. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But all the sudden you see some superstar and whatever, whatever their field is, whether it's a musician or whatever, you just assume that person has got to be like a different thing than you. This, you know, if you see Mick Jagger or something like that, that gets gotta be a different thing than me. Yeah. He's not the same thing as me.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       And, and the thing with, uh, and I started the Hashtag like 25 to life and all that be mostly because the way I grew up, I didn't get to see many successful people. You know what I'm saying? I didn't have him. I, it's, it's, uh, nobody ever told me, Oh, you can't do this. You know what I'm saying? But nobody ever told me. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:04       Could either. And nobody showed you other people that were doing it right around you, where you could learn from them,

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       had no examples. You know, the only examples, literally, only examples I had was, was the dope man. You know, the, the, the Jag Boys, you know, the, the pimps and you know, you didn't really have much else to really look forward to. So when I was, I thought when I was 25 like burning him now, I thought for sure I'm

Speaker 3:          01:04:25       just going to be in jail like that is that, that's one of the most important points when people talk about people being able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and they should just get a job and they should just do this. Like you say that because you grew up around that, but if you didn't grow up around anybody doing that, like your feeling that you feeling the way you felt when you were around wrestlers that had been competing their whole lives. You didn't feel like you belong there. You didn't have any of that at success around you. That's that is one of the most important things in life is surrounding yourself with positive people. It's so difficult to do if you're in a bad place. If you grew up in a bad neighborhood and you're surrounded by bad people, very few people have the vision to see past that and they have no examples. Yeah, I mean you see someone on television again, you're going to think, that's not me. Like, still to this day when I meet a rock star, I still get word of it. I still get weirded out. Doesn't matter how

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       famous you get, you get weirded out and run other famous people. They just don't seem like you, you know? And especially when you kind of grow up in that environment and you know, is you don't really, you know, you see a doctor on TV and you don't, you just don't connect with it, you know, at least for me, like that's what I wanted to be. I wanted to be a doctor, uh, first, but I didn't, you know, I didn't live in neighborhoods with doctors. You know, I didn't meet a doctor when I did. He was like some old dude and it's like he didn't really give a fuck. Like, he's like, you know, your mom, you know, you're on Medicaid motherfucker. Like, you know, take it 35 bucks and get the fuck off. But, you know, uh, Eh, I, I think that is a big point of it is just to have somebody to tell you that you can, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       So at least I tried. And then to see people around you that are working hard, succeeding and emulate them and learn from them people, we don't exist in a vacuum. We exist in communities. And that's, this is something that it's very difficult to people for people to understand if they're in a good community, if you're in a good community or if you're in a bad community, it's difficult to understand to the value of a good community, 100%. And I think one of the biggest things is just that integration is like really important. Like, and I'm starting to see that the more I'm getting out and kind of seeing the world and seeing the way things run and kind of comparing that to the way I grew up. And it's just like there was no, there was so much. It's just seems so segregated to me.

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       Uh, which is a weird term to use and this day and age, you know? But it just did like literally not the, I remember because my mom, she did a good job of keeping us in good schools, you know, so our school was on 10 mile, which was in the suburbs. I went to Southfield high. Uh, I remember a couple of times, me and my brother, we would try and walk to the school. So you had to walk pass through eight mile and a policeman had pulled over three or four times, picked us up in the car and took us back across and they dropped us off and just like you don't, and it's like we go to school there, you know what I mean? Like they didn't believe you and not a [inaudible]. We, you know, we, we were also like, the best I can give is probably starting to solve it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:25       You know, you're up to no good. Yeah, yeah, we do. But you know, I have to, but I feel like that integration, if it's just, it's just really, really important and I'm starting to see that the more I'm getting out and learning in the world, it's all the same. Literally all the same. All the same like, and everything for sure, but we're all just people, you know, and, and sometimes having all those advantages when you're young is a disadvantage because the hungriest most determined people are the people that had nothing at one point in their life when they understand what nothing means. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I think I attribute that to a lot of my success and that's what I, I always keep in the back of my head, you know, it's especially going through college, like such a rough, like, you know, 20 bucks a week as a vibe. Delpha. And I was, I was fighting for the time. I was taking 15 credits. Uh, I was wrestling still at

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       the same time, like, and I just was on the hustle. I was moving up the grind. Yeah. Super Grind, but on nothing. Like, you know, I had like a, uh, 1996, a Thunderbird would like 300,000 miles and I was Bernadette Shit over here every day. Uh, but I keep that in the back of my head. Even now. Like, I don't, I don't, I don't never get comfortable, never get contented.

Speaker 3:          01:08:38       When I think about that with having kids because I have young kids and I think my kids have never known like that kind of financial struggle. Like I think financial struggle in particular, something that just to this day I still think about being broken. It just, it, it, it motivates me. Like I'll, I'll never slack off because I just, I think if you haven't, but also like when you have kids, you don't want your kids to struggle. It's like all my friends that are interesting, all I've fucked up lives, all of them, everyone, everything went crazy. Everyone was fucking abused or someone was an asshole. The alcoholics or drug addicts and their family. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       yeah. They're on the fun ones and they're all my favorite people and they use it as motivation to learn the world and learn things. And that's what I kind of did as a, as a kid. I kind of took a look around when I was maybe 15. I was probably like the, the time that really clicked for me when I found him in May and I, and I kind of saw that this is what I want to do. Uh, that's when it kinda clicked how she's like, I don't want to be around like light the rest of these motherfuckers here. How'd you get started? Where'd you, where'd you find a good gym? So when I was 15, I just, uh, I saw George Saint Pierre and Bj Penn was the first time I'd seen a fight. And you know, there was no MMA gyms or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       I had just went out for the rest of the team at, at the high school because I was already there and all that. So, uh, I didn't start really getting into MMA and until I came back from college or one year from college and, uh, I wanted to sign up for a Jujitsu tournament and I had never trained it or anything. I went and signed up for a Jujitsu tournament and the guy's like, oh yeah, we do some fights on, on the, the sermon was Sunday. And he was like, we do some fights on Saturday and uh, there's nobody, uh, you know, for this, for this guy. I was like, fuck that motherfucker right now. Like, and I never tried before. I just wrestled. So I was like, yeah, please sign. It was like Tuesday. I had, how old are you? 18. Yeah. So I just showed up, you know, no mouthpiece. No, I didn't know you needed a mouthpiece or cup or anything, like have a car yet to do that fall. It was like 26 and I just went, well, they went to a Walmart, uh, because as I've, as I'm getting ready to step into the octagon to go, it was like, where's your mouthpiece and cup? And I was like, what? Like prepare for a wrestling match, I guess. And they ran through Walmart, grabbed me one it, I'll beat the fuck out it.

Speaker 2:          01:10:58       Did you have any striking at all? What I saw on the TV? Oh my God, I didn't really have real training until I got into the, uh, until I got over to, I mean, I trained hard, uh, with, with one of my coaches. I had, Sean did say he was my first true coaching in Michigan and we trained hard, uh, and he, he showed me a lot of things. He was a boxer, so he showed me a lot of things. Um, but I didn't really have a real, you know, I was still a full time student and when I got the call from the UFC, you know, I got the call in like December and finals. I got the call like finals week. And I was like, well shit, let me, let me go ahead and bust out these vitals and then, you know, I'm done with this shit. Uh, and then the fight was like late January, I think, or so. So I was like a full time student when I took the, I was taking 15 credits as a med student. So you really only had like a couple of years of striking at that point. Yeah, yeah. If that, yeah. You know, a lot of wrestling and a lot of, you know, I didn't really get it really good. It's a striking until I got over to Vegas and work with Dewey Cooper.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       That makes it even more impressive man. You know that you've been able to make such a big leap in such a short amount of time. I mean that's your were talking about like seven years that, I mean that's really, that's really crazy

Speaker 2:          01:12:09       consistency. I think consistency is the key. Like I love, I actually love this shit. Like I got the most fights, uh, in the lightweight division since my debut, the anybody else. And it's just cause I stay consistent. I keep my body healthy, I keep showing up. And you know, the more you see things coming at you, the, the, the better gift. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:12:27       that's definitely a factor. But I think it's also intelligence, the, the understanding of your also, like there's, there's different kinds of intelligence too. And there's intelligence of like how to get good at things. And some people just, I don't know if it's a physical thing, if their body works better or if it's just that they are able to see how someone does something and listen to instruction and then break it down and put it together. But I've seen in little kids, man, when I used to teach little kids, there was little kids that weren't even like physically town does not like the, they were gymnasts. They could do back flips and shit. They do crazy shit with their body. There's some kids where you would show him like, see this foot, this foot's got pivot, and then you're, it's all about your hips. And they would see you and they would go, okay. And then you'd see them breaking it down. And then other kids, oh, the fucking, they just couldn't see what you were doing there. Throw their feet up in their air, their foot would never pivot. They're putting all this pressure on the knee. Like, what? Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Don't, don't do that. Don't do that. You got to turn your hips, your foot's got to go with it. And then some people just could mirror you see in Jujitsu too.

Speaker 2:          01:13:28       Yeah, yeah, for sure. Big Time and Jujitsu and grapple and especially, you know, grappling, wrestling it. They just see it. I think it's, I think it's come, like you said, it's a, it's an intelligence there. There's people think it's just a brute, no thing that you're doing. But it's, it's, it's very, you know, at least from me, like our approach, it kind of like a science. It's almost is a, B, c, d, e you know, I go from here. If, if, if not, then I branch off. I have different systems for every kind of a situation that will arise, but I, I kind of approach it like a scientist. Like I went to school if a biomed, like that kind of stuff interests me, you know what I mean? Like there's art to it. There's a, there's a huge, huge portion of it. That's our expression. Yeah. The expression part is his art and I

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       think it's one of the pure as art forms fighting this, make sure that there is, you know, if someone looks great doing it, that is like a form of art. Oh 100% a hundred percent I think it's, I, I get so irritated whenever somebody says is not there because I get so irritated. Like, did you see Beltour when Gaston Bolanos landed that uh, insane spinning elbow. It's like one of the greatest spinning elbows of all time. She said Shit about 80 times. I just play it back like I'm watching a flower bloom or watching a fucking eagle soar. It's just, he lands this, he just, the dude's coming at him, he steps and she's had the perfect face plants. I'm like, that shit is just art. That's art. But even when you see like a really, really high level fighter move around, every one of our bodies moves different, you know, every, you know, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       You, you, you go back to, you know, being able to see somebody in emulate it, but you still will put your own style on it. You still put you on. Nobody moves the same, you know? And I think that's what makes it a pure art form. And I think MMA is more so even the boxing because in boxing you only got two hands, right? It's a science, you know, it's the sweet science. There's only so many combinations that you can even put together that. But when you, when you talk about something that you know, without limit, then there's so much art that goes into, it's like dance. It's like, it's like yoga. It's like all these things that are really the truest form of art I think. Yeah. I couldn't agree more, you know? And that's why I was mad at Mel's Meryl Streep. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       Know she doesn't know anything about mixed martial arts, not VR. They are the arts 100%. And I think the most purest form of it to, uh, what else did you call arts, if not that it's not simply to understand what it is. And one of the things that they don't understand is that it's so difficult to do and that your, when you see the finished product, when the person steps into the cage and competes that night, you're not just seeing these brutish moves. You're seeing their soul. You're seeing how much focus, where they are as a human in their life at this point. Where's the vitality of their body? What kind of martial arts education have they gotten? How technically aware then how much did they think about the training? Did they, if they're a wrestler, did they only concentrate on the wrestling? Did they stay away from striking cause they don't like getting hit if they're a striker, did they only concentrate on staying up or did they learn how to fight on the ground?

Speaker 1:          01:16:32       Did they absorb it all? Did they develop a full repertoire of expression with their body, throwing bones and choking each other? I mean, and at the same time going through life through the whole situation, you know, kind of because the hardest part, like at the end of the day I was still a 25 year old dude. Like, I'm still like learning and shit and try to keep it together like everybody else. So, and I'd be like that when you're 80 men rally and we look at these 80 year old people who say, well that guy should have his shit together, that fucking guys better today than he was yesterday. If I was paying attention, I think that he had to go back. And I think that's what it is to at the of it. I always think that everybody else has their shit together. I just saw sold everybody all childhood, 100%.

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       I think one it was, I had the same problem. I think everybody has their shit together and everybody can see that. I don't feel like they can see my flaws. And it keeps me sharp though. Like it translates to fight and too, it's like if my hand calls here for a split second, I feel like the guy can see it, you know what I mean? Or why not throw something. I'm, I feel like he's gonna be there to block it or, you know, it makes, it makes me stay sharp, but, uh, it's, it goes up from sometimes outside of life too, you know? Well, it's good that you think like this because clearly you're a very confident guy and you're obviously successful and you're mixed martial arts career. But to have just a little bit of that insecurity is fuel. It's just like, he keeps you sharp.

Speaker 1:          01:17:57       It keeps you aware, you know, like to be confident is good, to be delusional is terrible. Yeah. 100% terrible. Everybody knows that one guy that thinks he can beat a guy that he's not ever going to fucking be able to be. You know? I mean, there's a lot of people like, give me that fight. I'll, oh yeah, wait, no, that's why you don't see, you know, you never see me say some outlandish shit. Like, oh, I can't never be beat or, you know, or I'm, oh, I can go out there and, you know, our bar, Cain Velasquez, you know, or something like that. I mean, not meaning to pick on Ron, but uh, I know he was saying, yeah, but you know, but I think, you know, the Rhonda thing was there was a lot going on there, man. Coaching wise, there's a lot going on there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       What? She just came along at a time when there was no one like her when she was a real Olympic caliber athlete and her judo was at such a high level. No one could fuck with him and shit, throwing people around until someone could fuck with her until she ran into someone like Holly Holm. And then, then we really saw the holes in the preparation, the distractions, the fact that she had, you know, movie deals going on. They wanted her to do road house and she's scripts and this and agent meetings and all the bullshit man. It's like a fucking Hollywood. It was like a Hollywood script. Like, this is what happens to you and this is how it look rocky. When rocky went soft and this is literally what happens. And then all of a sudden you've got this bad ass Holly Holm sitting there ready to fucking head kick you into another dimension.

Speaker 1:          01:19:29       And that's what happened. And like you said, I think, I think most of it is just trying to stay aware and not get the delusional about it. Cause it's, it is very easy to kind of slip into that and fall into that. And you know, sometimes she will hit you. And that's what happened in my, in my second fight that I lost, uh, to Leonardo Santos and, and each fight I can always see myself losing. You know, and people ask me that and they're like, you talk about all this visualization that you do. Like sometimes I visualize myself getting hurt too. When fights do you do that to see how you recover? How do you, what do you do? So it's not a new experience. I Went Barboza fucking spinning heel kicks me in the head

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       like his, it's not, uh, it's not, it's always the punch that don't hurt you. It hurts. You were texting before that fight and we were setting up this podcast. You, I just listen, I just got to concentrate on making sure I do. Don't kick me in the head. And then after the pilot, Dan, we fucking kicked me in the head. You have definitely, definitely prepare yourself for the possibility it because, because it has to be,

Speaker 2:          01:20:31       be there. That's the only fight that it wasn't there for me was uh, Leonardo Santos because he, he was, I mean he multiple times a champion on the ground and Jujitsu. So I was only really worried about his ground game. I kind of just dismissed his, his, uh, his standup and I was like, no way this guy's going to beat me. And the worst thing happened in the fight. Like the first minute he got me down and I got all, I got him off me and like 30 seconds or something. Then after that I was like, whew, this about to be a cakewalk. I'm might just run through this man. Like he don't, you know, I'm like, it was 17,000 people in an arena. I'm like, we all just waiting on him to fall, you know, only him. He was the only one that sought it.

Speaker 2:          01:21:12       He could clip me and I'd be dead. But how valuable was that fight for you? I mean it was probably one of the most important ones in my career. I mean there there's been a couple of the losses are have always been the ones that I feel like I will look back and say, damn, that was the one that really made it. That fight in particular I think really made it because it, it kind of drilled home. Some of the things that Robert follows was sounding to me that's the only fight since I've been in Vegas. Well obviously since before this fight, but that Robert Follis wasn't in my corner and it was, if I'm being honest with save some money, you know, saved the 10% that he, that he wasn't wanted or whatever, and I was like, I'm going to smoke this kid. I'm like, rob, just sit back, you know, you watch it from home and joy and I'm gonna go out there and I'm a smoke this kid.

Speaker 2:          01:22:03       And I didn't have his voice of reason to make me say, this kid is dangerous everywhere. You know what I mean? Stay sharp everywhere and I let my guard down any and he hit me with a good punch. Uh, but it was that one where I was like, I've never had robbed, not in my corner again or that voice, you know, and now I have to make do without it. But you know, now usually was that boy. So yeah, he was, but to go back and he was just that voice of reason not to get delusional. You know what I mean? Cause it's because it is easy, especially when you're young and you got the no hormones line or you feel like you would a man, like, you know, you competent like shit, I'm the man. Like he can't touch me. But you got to have somebody like, hey bro, bro, you know, you are very good, but you still gotta be sharp to the, these men that you fighting are very, very good too.

Speaker 2:          01:22:52       Do you think that sometimes someone can't tell it to you? You just have to learn it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You got to go through those experiences and I think doesn't, that's an all walks of everything, you know, and, and, and, and that's kind of what I bring to a year. Like I don't, I don't want to just be a, just a great fighter, you know, I want to be graded everything. I want to be a chef and I want to be a dancer and I want to be a, science isn't a doctor. And like that's just the way my brain works. I just wanted to be a better fucking everything the right way to think, man. I've done that. It's kind of inner sometimes, but you know, but, uh, you know, there's a great, I need that

Speaker 3:          01:23:28       depression. The way you do anything is the way you do everything.

Speaker 2:          01:23:32       Yeah. Well probably. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:23:35       Yeah. I mean, I, I think, I think there's something to that. If you have fast things mean you can get away with being a great fighter and still half ass things you live, but maybe you would be better if you didn't like maybe you would be even in an even better fighter or better whatever you are, fucking tennis player, whatever it is. If you didn't half ass other things in your life, maybe you, you would really reach your full potential

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       100%. And I think that even even in the fighting realm, you know, that that's what a lot of this last fight was for me. A is getting back to making the fight first, doing, focusing on the fight before anything else and relieving some of the mental stress off me before I stepped into the, when I stepped in for that Co, uh, Tony Fight, I was already tired. I was already, my body was already, my brain was just overloaded and I was already broken down and you know, I'd made the fight second or I made the fight last, you know, uh, I put everything else before, you know, it. We went and race car, drive it the week of the fight and, and looking back on it after, I was like, oh my God. Yeah. You go to one of those exotic places during races, shout out to them like they, I mean they look me up. I have fun too. I think it's also important to have some recreation. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, that's, that sounds like it was too much. A little too much. And mostly because they were like filming it and I wanted to make it good and then, you know, we have fun with it and Oh for like the countdown shows. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, so you get that balance. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:25:01       How hard is that? The press obligations and all the constant interviews and all that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:25:06       Joy. I mean, I enjoy them. I honestly enjoy doing media for the most part is just, you know, on a certain it can be too much sometimes

Speaker 3:          01:25:17       organize it around your training or did you have to organize your training around media obligate? I usually organize it around my training. Uh, and that's good. It was when, when you hear that the training has to be organized around media obligations and like, Oh yeah, that's not true. I mean maybe I've heard of people having to get up at six in the morning and do a write blocker radio calls and shit. I'm like, well I don't like that. I don't like that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:25:41       Yeah. I mean, yeah, you have to do that, but you know, I still, I kinda, I just make do with it, you know what I mean? I think as long as you enjoying it and you just kind of going with the flow is not a hindrance necessarily. If you, if you like, fuck, I don't want to fucking be here. I want to get up at 6:00 AM and do this shit. You know? Then when you get to all that want to do is train, the whole time, you know, is it can be a hindrance. Even Morrison. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Yeah, I guess, right. Like the way you approach something will change, like what that thing is.

Speaker 2:          01:26:10       Yeah. And it's gotta be natural for you to, you know, I actually liked liked doing it, so, uh, I think it's just something that, you know, if you, if, if I could see myself, if I forced it or if I, you know, was one of these guys that didn't at all, then yeah, I could see it being even a bigger hindrance, but since I get at me, it's fine.

Speaker 3:          01:26:28       Does great. Well, as long as it doesn't fuck with your training. One of the things I was really impressed about Saturday night is your endurance. I mean, you were, you were fresh as a daisy even in the fifth round, and that was a grueling pace,

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       you know? And, uh, we didn't really focus too much on, on too much conditioning. You know, I did a lot of long runs to, to kind of thin the, my muscles out a little bit. Uh, I did a lot of like longer distance, longer cardio stuff, kind of got away from like a lot of the explosiveness that I used to do on the, especially for the Tony Fight, Tony fight was all explosion. It was all like big movements. It was all like, you know, I'm out there, I'm a nut, this motherfucker out. Uh, but this fight. And I realized like during it, I was like, you know, I got to approach it smarter and, and, and in that it actually became better cardio then me pushing myself too hard, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          01:27:19       You know, I'm torn on that because I see guys preparing that way where they do a lot of long runs and you know, that's a big Nate Diaz thing and his brother Nick and you know, they do ultra marathons and triathlons and I feel like there's some real benefit to having that deep bass and cardio

Speaker 2:          01:27:35       100%. But I mean, it's, it's balanced, balanced, like anything else would life, you know, you gotta, you gotta be able to, to balance those really strong, tough, you know, you can't explore every time. He has spread the whole time. But I can't run a marathon the whole time. So I try my best to, that's how I want to be as well rounded as I possibly can be. And, and having great cardio in and understanding what that's like. Uh, as part of that, yes. It's hard for

Speaker 3:          01:28:00       people don't understand, but you're not throwing a hundred percent of your power all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:28:04       Yeah. You can't, you can't. No, you can't. Especially not with a guy like Barboza, uh, who is in there the whole time. There was some spots that I got him and it's like, guys, normally we'll, we'll, we'll give up. They'll quit or, you know, I'm hitting them with big shots and he's just steady showing the ref day. I'm still in this thing. I'm still moving. And then he stands up and he can spit. It will get you in. You know, he's still got that explosiveness and uh, you know, you, you can't go 100% right out the gate. You, you got to pick him, be kind of, be smarter. You can't wear out how to be smart. And that's one of the things that rob would always tell me. And again, that's one of the things I'm telling myself during the fights. Be Smart, be smart.

Speaker 3:          01:28:41       Barboza is also the, I think the first guy and the only guy to stop to people with leg.

Speaker 2:          01:28:46       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Vicious. Like Kit Kat, my shit, my shit is on fire right now. I checked a couple of them up, but did you bring in anybody that does wheel kicks or anything to get used to the timing of that? Yeah. A couple of guys, a really good taekwondo,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       a specialist, and his name is, I mean, you wouldn't know. Notice a flash out off the black. I know he, he's probably the best at easy, little bit better than marbles. The marbles is, no, no, no. It just on that not telegraphic portion of it because that's what really gets you hurt, which Barboza is very non telegraphy. But those taekwondo guys, they, they can move a little bit different. You know, Chris Bang is a, is another one, uh, that, that uh, like woolly brought out for, for wonder boy because he's got that same style day. Th that taekwondo style of spinning is, it's a little bit different. I brought up like three or four guys. Well it's the guy when they, when you train like that, you're not throwing punches to the face. So the kicks have to be ultra fast. It's, and there's also, I think there's, uh, there's this, this is some benefit to learning like Kyoko Shin for that and talk window for that.

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       W when they, they take out those punches to the face. There's something about leg dexterity. Those guys have crazy leg like Yaya Rodriguez style, like crazy leg dexterity. Yeah, man. Yeah. You've got to spar a couple of times before this last fight, you know, and he, he's another one of those. I mean he, he's got that same type of style and not, and I steal a lot from those guys. Uh, I kind of started picking it up when I fought a kid named James Mutasa re very good. He was married champion champion a couple of times I think, uh, for, for uh, Korea. But I mean he's just super underrated, especially as kicking but prepared for that fight. I had to work with a lot of taekwondo guys and right off the back I'm like, oh, this is a different style. Like it's, it's like four different, four or five different styles of kicking up.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       Think there's this like wanted a better mixes of speed and power and not telegraphic. And I try to blend that a little bit more. What Moy Tai and find the best style. I feel like more is absolutely the best, but there's some shit that those taekwondo guys can do that'll catch you off guard. And if you know those other things, you can do those things. Yeah, 100% like the wheel kicks. And that's what what you see with the eds. I mean the, the Thai style has probably the hardest kicks and the, the most technical, uh, from it. But you know, you can kind of see some of them come in, you know, you could see unless you got free speed light like Barboza you know, but actual technical wise, you know, you can kind of see it coming a little bit more time is more effective because it's just more effective.

Speaker 1:          01:31:24       This chopping the legs, it just brutally effective. And obviously in taekwondo there's none of that. Yeah. So those guys wouldn't, if you were seeing like matches we're talking with no guys fight Moy Thai guys, they get a blood red. Yeah, yeah. No for sure. If you allow the Moy Thai guy to kick the legs, taekwondo guys just really don't know what to do. Once they learn it, then they have the taekwondo too. But it's a matter of whether or not, like we were talking about before, like if you're a wrestler, do you really learn how to try? Could you just try take everybody? But you know, it's, if the taekwondo guys really learn how to check leg kicks, they already know how to kick. Yeah. They'll, they'll be able to pick up the style way

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       quicker than the Thai guys are going to be able to do jumping wheel kicks and shit like that. That stuff is already ingrained in their wheelhouse. It's in their synapses. They know what to do.

Speaker 2:          01:32:09       Yeah. And that's that. I think that's one of the things that the beauties about MMA being such a young sport is, you know, you still seeing guys evolving and, and you know, like, like me, I'm trying to take that, the best of those styles and make them great for MMA. You know, because there are certain, you know, you can't chop down the leg if, if a guy's trying to take you down, you know, but you could steal a chopped the leg. But there's certain ways that you can change that up. And, uh, that's one of the beauties about the sport being so youngest. Still figuring out, people ask me, I sat right next to a Oh area, what shall I sat right next to, to Demetrius Johnson and they asked me who's the best pound for pound fighter. And you know, I think people like expected me to say me or something or to say Dj.

Speaker 2:          01:32:48       And I honestly don't think that he's been testing yet. You know, I think he's still like a 16 year old kid out there somewhere that's going to find the best guy out. That really, yeah. You don't think Demetrius is the best guy? No, I didn't meet you as hell. I mean Demetrius does a, I mean he's great, he does a lot of things, but he gets away with a lot of stuff that he does because the guys that he's going against our 25 pounders, you know, they don't have a whole lot of explosive one punch power to really make you pay for something to mistakes. You know, the like as far as, especially as far as like the hop switching and stuff, you know, that's why I got like, like Tj can get away with it a lot more at 35 I think then a 55 pound fighter would, you know, Tj crews, a lot of those 35 years that can kind of, that style

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       leave opening the consequences could be so much more devastating because they hit so much harder.

Speaker 2:          01:33:37       Yeah. I mean your legs are your, your shock absorbers. You know, when, when I get the wall, the leg or the shotguns doors, if your legs are in the air while you get hit by somebody that's explosive like that you going night night, you know, the only thing that's eaten, all the shock of your brain,

Speaker 3:          01:33:52       Duane Ludwig would disagree with you if you sat down and talked to him. Cause I think the idea is to present a very complex target and to overload the brain with positive

Speaker 2:          01:34:02       buildings. I feel that, you know, and, and, and, and I try and do that too. I try and uh, you know, I've taken Dwayne's a, a couple of the ways seminars actually, and he's a wizard. Yeah. Yeah. He comes over to extreme, but 200 does some things. So, you know, I liked, I like his style. Shout out to Duane Ludwig. Yeah, no, I, I, I love the way you style and it's just a different style to be had, but I feel like that's not even, it's still not the best out. You know, I don't think the best style has been, Demetrius Johnson has a great style, but I don't think it's the best style has been seen yet.

Speaker 3:          01:34:29       Hmm. Especially for him, it, but out of what you've seen, he's got the best style. Yeah. I mean, everybody's different. Everybody's different, you know what I'm saying is the argument is him and Jon Jones, the two arguments, and I feel like John Jones, as far as the level of talent, no question. John's faced for show gone d c twice Gustafson. I mean, yeah, Vito Belfort. I mean, Jesus Christ do, you could just keep going and going and, and gone

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Glover to sharer. You know, he's got, he's got the resume, but I don't know, I think, I think George Saint Pierre, uh, right steel, you know, Georgia is a little bit, uh, you know, behind the times now a little bit. Do you think so a little bit, man. I don't know. After that that's been fired. I would never say that. Yeah. Yeah. But, but you know, Bisping is also from the same era. I think. Um, I think Georgia, if Jason, George Saint Pierre for sure, I think is the greatest fighter that there's been. I don't, I mean, when you look at the resumes, I don't think nobody else compares really. Uh, you know, he's got two losses to binge both those losses and devastatingly, you know, came back after four years and won the title at a higher weight class and he's never really been in too much trouble in a fight.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       Uh, you know, I look at his style. He's one of those guys, he's one of the very first guys. He's really what got me into the sport because I saw his fight with Bj and I just, I can see it. I'm like, Oh, this guy is, you know, he's smart. He's approaching it smart like a, like a true athlete, you know, like a true artist, like true athlete. And uh, there, there are people that do it too. You know, Demetrius does too. But I just don't think to the level that George has done well, again, it's the level of competition that he faced. I mean judge George face some seriously stiff competition. Not that Demetrius didn't, I mean he fought Dominick Cruz. He's fought some tough cause I was really looking forward to Demetrius versus Tj and I know they were trying to put that together, but that would have been the one love that fight.

Speaker 1:          01:36:28       And it still might be the one, they might still do it. I mean, if a Tj can defeat Cody or even if he doesn't and if he decides to go down to 25, he can make it. He says, yeah, he says he can make it. Yeah, I think you can in a, I think he can give them some real problems. Oh, it'll be the biggest fight of his life. 100% sure he's fast. He hits hard, he knocks guys out at 35, what the fuck is he going to do to people at 25 if he can, if his body will stay healthy with that weight cut, you know, and you know as good as anybody that that's very difficult to do because you just feel weaker. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there's that, uh, I, I know the guys that he, that he trains down in South California with um, uh, the training lab.

Speaker 1:          01:37:09       That man approaches it like a scientist for real. He, I think he's a mathematician over at UC Berkeley. I want to change this guy. I sat down with them for about, we talked for maybe about five, six hours. It was mostly him just talking. It may just sitting there absorbing all the shit that he could tell me about, you know, exactly. He, I mean, he measures those guys to, to a t. Uh, so if he feels like he can, who's training with him? Uh, Dillashaw and is he a strength and conditioning guys? Sam, uh, cal cal veto. If I'm saying that Right Sam Cup or you know, down to train and lap. Okay. Brilliant. Brilliant man. He, he's, he's one of the very few guys that, that I think in MMA especially that really, he, he trained a lot of uh, he trains David Taylor, a lot of the, the

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       u s uh, Olympic wrestling team. He worked with those guys for a long time. What are you seeing? Some mad scientists get into the game now, right when they realize that there's real money in it and it's just mad. Is what 55 56 does a those iron mans, you know where you got to like, I think it's like something crazy like bike 120 miles and then you swim 20 miles and then you run a full marathon and he's doing it like 53 54 years old. I'm like, God, I went over and train with them before and it is, is something is another level of like strength and conditioning. So if he says he can get TJ down to 25, I mean I would, I would think he could do it. And if he's confident in it, then he can do it in the right way.

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       At least. I spoke to Tj, he was a hundred percent confident that it could make the way and he just, well you got also realize Dj Dimitris just got shoulder surgery, so he's still rehabbing from that, you know, and who knows how long that's going to take. I don't know how complex this shoulder surgery was, but yeah, that's, you know, still interested in that fight. I mean that's, it's a big one for, uh, for Demetrius Johnson especially, you know, he needs that extra little push over. You know how Shannon gave him some tips, some tricks when we were still in the media tours together for the talk shit. No, not necessarily to talk shit, but, you know, cause he, he, he's not going to be able to come out and just talk shit. You know, he's kind of style. It's not his style. It don't work, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       Uh, but to round out his game a little bit. Boy, let's say that I know he says, because I'm going to go back to the most well rounded fighter. You got to be able to promote to, you know, you've got to be able to see, people want to want to see you fight to, uh, and that thing is a stress. It's a, it's a stressor on you and you're on your, you're training, like you said, you've got to get up at 6:00 AM because when you do it, you get more media requests. So you get, you get to have those interviews more and that's a stress and it's something that you, Barron at your opponent don't necessarily have to, you know, a, a guy like Conor does a lot more media than, than his opponent though of course, it's, it's a bigger stress and you know, if you can handle all those stresses and still go out there and compete, uh, then if you shy away from that, I got to take that away from you as far as being the best power file pod fighter.

Speaker 2:          01:40:06       You know what I mean? That's interesting. But if it's not Demetrius, and who the fuck is it other than George and George isn't really fighting [inaudible] for short. John Jones, you know, I think George really fighting right now either. Oh you saying right, right now in this sport it was hard because John, I mean it's up there. I mean I don't think John took PDDs and people give me a hard time about that. I don't think he did. I think he took something tainted just based on what you saw to has said about the levels pre and post test. I think you fucked up and tell us. I'm that muddy up mass man. I was roof too fucked up money. But he could still, they could still come back and be much bigger. Uh, you know, like I said, controversy, especially when you know, especially when you're black in America, controversy is, is, is, is one of the best things they can have until you really, well John, when he's loose and when you know, like when

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       him and Daniel were in that press conference and Danny was talking shit, he goes, I beat you after I did cocaine. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:40:59       What jaws. Just himself. I mean, he's huge. He's, he's, he's, he's going to be the biggest, uh, he could have already been the biggest star. V You're just on the beginning.

Speaker 3:          01:41:08       If they don't really suspend him for very long when he comes back within a few months, it's entirely possible that he could come back, you know, and be the biggest still of all time. I think he's going to be way bigger. Uh, especially after, like I said, controversies is a great one. Where you black in America, they really, dad, it's like for John, like how much, how much more focus will there, I mean my fear is that he's going to s somehow another sabotage again and that, that this is not just this, that these lessons aren't sinking in because there's been so many of them. The car accident where the broke the lady's arm and she's pregnant and he runs away and then slamming the car into the tree. There was so many. And then there's, you know, the first test positive and then the second test, positive like, fuck the brawl, the press conference. Fuck. It's like, there's so many things

Speaker 2:          01:42:01       I think that goes back to, you know, not being delusional and having the right team around you and somebody that you really listened to, that's that you really truly listened to, you know, not just somebody that you just kind of hard. Right. Yeah, I hear you. Uh, because it's easy to get that way. It really is. I'm sure like in, I've approached it a couple of times, you know, you get that, especially when you got that confidence in the thing that made you great in the first place. It can be like a hindrance to you too. And I think a lot of it has been, or at least a lot of my growth in the past couple of months has been me getting in my own head and understanding it and, and kind of breaking it down. Uh, you know, smoke weed helps a lot to you that God is legal now.

Speaker 2:          01:42:48       Yeah. I didn't start until after my last, uh, to Leonardo. Really? Yeah. First Time that idea. But honestly it was probably like the best thing that, because I was angry at the fight. I was angry at everything, you know, the, I was like, fuck, how can I, you know, this guy, I was like a 10 to one favorite going into that fight. That was the one fight without never saw him. I was like, don't you smoke them? Uh, so I just had this anger and the only way I saw my dad can I deal with it was it was alcohol. So I kind of turned to that and you know that it's no good. It's really, it's the worst way to do it. Worst way to do it. It just makes the delusions bigger. You know what I'm saying? It just makes you angry or in, and it just, it just kind of compounded everything.

Speaker 2:          01:43:30       But honestly, like what I smoke weed was like, cause at that point hasn't like, you know what, I had tuned it out for so long because that's what folks did that I kind of associated with being lazy and the hospice as well. And you know, these fucking, you know, you know, I don't want to be on a corner, right? Like, uh, but when I did it, it kind of opened up the anger towards myself. You know what I mean? It kind of opened up my mom for the first time and, and, and I think that actually did help a lot of help with any, you know, I don't, I don't like karate or nothing, but you know, I know what you're saying. Yeah. I think that's what people were afraid

Speaker 3:          01:44:06       of with it too, is that paranoia. I would say paranoia is just you looking at things realistically and even the possibilities of things happening realistically. I mean, some people for sure, if they have tendencies to be schizophrenia in particular and then they smoke a lot of weed, it could spiral them.

Speaker 2:          01:44:22       Cool. Yeah, it does sound like anything else I spoke, it's not a good idea that, you know, isn't doing too much of any one thing is not a good idea. I mean, he's the same way. You have to, you have to be able to, to balance, you know what I mean? You can't just fucking sit on the couch all day, but I'm glad. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       You're saying that there's a real benefit to it too. There's some, there's a benefit to it mentally and exposing that vulnerability and just making you aware of who you really are. Like maybe to other people. We all, especially men, I think we puff our chests up and we like to look at ourselves as a baby better than we really are because it's, it's, it's like a shield that like a false confidence shield that you put up to protect yourself from your vulnerability. But marijuana says not enough. Fuck that. Why don't you just look at whatever the fuck your vulnerability and stopped doing that stupid like this is, this is your problem, this is what you're scared of me. Like Shit. The weeds, right?

Speaker 2:          01:45:15       Yeah. It can help you. Yeah. And it, and it Kinda Alexa App, especially after that fight, I remember it. That really made me, that really helped me to get over and not just get over it, but to understand it and understand what I was doing. Uh, because again, you just don't, you know, you get that the informal is maybe it's testosterone. You get that fucking, yeah. Puppy. He's just all, you know, you don't give a fuck you part of it for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:45:38       It's just, it's also think about what you're doing for a living man, ma'am. It's the most, one of the most risky propositions you could do as a human being outside of war.

Speaker 2:          01:45:46       That, that too. That too. And I took that into, you know, you, you obviously you take that into consideration when you, when you start doing something like this, I'd taken into consideration every fight. Um, you know, once slight one slip up, you could be bad news. Sure. Injury can take you out forever, you know, especially when the EU was, and when I was in my situation and even when I was signed with the UFC, it was like, okay, do I go and try and be a doctor and you know, or you know, I was, I was going into bio mat so I was like, I was really, that seemed more secure. You know what I mean? That seems more like attainable easier or do I like, I can't like throw caution to the wind. And you know, at the time when I was 18 or 19, uh, no, I guess I'm a yeah, 19. Uh, you know, that was like a hard, you know what I'm saying? I'm one of those ones that was hard for me to make, but it turned out well I guess at least. Well it's,

Speaker 3:          01:46:45       you're going to have more than one interest too. That's also part of the problem. There's probably, there's a lot of people out there that like doing different things and you, you know, you might be leaning more towards one than the other and you just got to kind of soul search and nobody could answer that other than you. That's why it's terrible when people tell people what to do. When people tell people what you need to do is get a good job or you need to go with something that's going to be saved, go with what's attainable. Go with that. And I'm like, man, that's not right. Well, everybody's different.

Speaker 2:          01:47:14       100% and I think that's the, I mean to go back just to rob desk, that's what he did so well he didn't, he didn't tell me what to do. He just showed me the truth kind of, you know what I mean? He just, he was that voice. Am I, it was like the conscious and I mean, and it hit your show. It too, like you do a good job, you do a great job of it. Uh, and I mean I know you've heard it before, like you just are very truthful in what you say and instead of being like preachy because nobody listened to fucking preachy. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:47:44       She's usually, well I try not to be, but sometimes it comes off maybe sounding preachy if you don't know me, but it's just honest and that, you know, there's what you said about Robert, one of the most important things about it is that he shows you, he's just showing you and you could trust him. You know, those, those two things are very important. Someone who would just show you things, show you what's wrong, showing and that you can trust. He's not bullshitting you. When as soon as you think that someone is bullshitting you are bullshitting themselves or being Dell, you're like, fuck man, I can't cause they might have good information about other things. That's a real problem when someone's an idiot, but also a genius like that that exists. There's people out there and those people you can, that's how fucking puzzle you got to go. Okay, how much of this do what he's saying is stupid? How much of what he's saying is genius and sometimes it's a weird mixture.

Speaker 2:          01:48:35       Yeah. This is, I think that's one of the things that I'm learning, especially as I'm kind of going forward and cause you may get to meet so many people and uh, so many people want to be a friend. All of a sudden there's so many people, everybody's got, they want to tell you how to do your job. Like everybody want to tell me how to fight and everybody wanted to tell me like what to do and how to do this awesome thing. But some people really know what they're talking about actually though. So you have to be able to, you know, I think you got to find that yellow bullshit meter in there and, and kind of pick it apart. It for me, rob was dead and you know, he, but the, the shit that he's still says this is, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:49:11       I mean, you still get information on how to fight from your yoga instructor. She could say something to you and that one thing will just sit in your head. Oh

Speaker 2:          01:49:18       yeah. I had a, uh, a girl named, you call it a little Japanese girl, uh, that was giving me privates and, and Yoga. But the way she broke it down was like anatomy almost. She knew the exact, you know, position that I was here instead of being here where I was losing my balance or I was losing something of power or it was putting more strain on one area the other and making it harder. And I'm just like, this translates so well, you know, even when I do ballet, it's like, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       I can see when I'm off balance when um, you know, as one of the things and ballets as you spend in, you know, keep your eyes on there so you don't get dizzy. So even when proposal he kicked me, I just made sure I saw four of them, but I'm like, let me keep my eyes on this motherfucker. He's like, stay on of it. But it all, it all translate because it's all the human body is called the same thing. Yeah. You know, it's just different ways of expressing the way your body moves and what it does. But it's the same shit. It says it's only one, it's like a giant computer. And I would think that learning all these different ways to move would just enhance your overall understanding of how your body works and it makes you, I think it like makes you more in tune with it too.

Speaker 1:          01:50:29       You know what, I may get healthy. That's one of the biggest keys. I think it's just being as healthy as as possible. And not, uh, you know, tamper on with that too much for sure. And also flexibility. I think having flexibility is so important. They are a fighter, you know, being able to move your body. Like there's some people that just aren't flexible, they just can't move in certain ways. And you know, I can tell from watching you throw head kicks and not fight. Like you're, you're flexible. You don't have a lot of tension in your legs when you're doing that. You know, I think tension is that, is that it's like the perfect word for it really is because that's what causes you to tighten to, yeah. Like when you got, when a guys, it's difficult for him to throw a body kick. Can you see him kind of like lean in and you see the instructor?

Speaker 1:          01:51:12       I loved Dan Henderson, big fan. I've got to say, you can even touch his toes when he threw a head kick in the Hector lumbar finals. Like Holy Shit. But it's the way he takes a lot of, you know, whereas some people throw head kicks and you don't even see it coming. Yeah. Yeah. And, and also Lynn and grappling into, you know, you have to be able to have strength I think in every direction. That's one of the biggest reason why I don't lift weights as cause you get so used to in that one uniform direction, you have to be able to move. I have to be just as strong here as I am here as I am there. Do you get all your resistance from just grappling or from these, these calisthenics and plow metrics and different things? Grappling a lot. Just pick guys up and put them down.

Speaker 1:          01:51:59       So it's concise. It does 100%. A lot of body weight to 100% exercise. Now did they concentrate on like specific core exercises or do you know, do you, do you have days where you concentrate on just using your legs or uh, yeah, different, different days dependent. We do. We do do a lot of core stuff, especially recently. Uh, probably like the last year or so, we've been doing a lot more, uh, with the core. Uh, legs is a, is a huge one. You know, your legs carry pretty much the whole way. Kills. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I live in Henderson, so it's like, you know, a lot of hills, but, um, legs is one of the biggest, just even my movement, like the way you move to a lot of times I'll notice how I'll be to, you know, up on the balls on my feet or I'll be too flat on, on my heels.

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       So as you know, I think that came from wrestling a little bit though. The stances are different. Um, but it's just rounding out me as a individual is going to round out me as a fighter, which has just gone make it bigger, better. Do you watch fights outside of MMA? Do you watch kickbox 100%. What do you like to watch? Love Him. I mean, I watch a lot of the big box and fights, especially, I barely, I only got to see like little clips and pieces of the Broner and, and, and uh, I was paying more attention to his arguments with fits rapper kid. That's six EA. You're going back and forth and look what the fuck is wrong with Andrew Brown and he's entertaining this. The week of the fight talking shit on Instagram. I think they were just doing their thing, making it, making media.

Speaker 1:          01:53:28       Uh, I think it was bullshit because he came out to six nines a song and it's six, nine kind of like shouted it out for Broner. Came out to six, nine songs, came out to the solid during the fight. I haven't seen the video yet. I got to go back and listen and go on, go on. Six, nine, his Instagram, he posted it up. Hilarious. So 69 changes to now. He likes Broner. I mean, look at it. He was shouting, Gopros, smart move. I mean they did they pay. He actually, you know, brought her is a he, I mean he did his thing and in that fight too, he outworked Jesse Vargas that that's hard to do. Uh, I heard he beat the hell out of them at the after eight rounds. Uh, he beat out the hell out of him for the last four, so I have to watch it, watch it to home. I wanted to watch your fight and Frankie's fight and um, and uh, David Branch man knocking out to, I'll go Santos like that. Holy Shit. Branch is tough, but he's a bad motherfucker. Do People Sleep on branch? Cause he lost to Luke Rockhold. Luke Rockhold is a fucking beast, especially on top.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       He got Weidman down on the ground. By the way. Luke Rockhold, we fought Weidman had staff. He was, yeah, he was going through his fucking the antibiotics. He was two weeks out. He's, he's in like serious fucking IV antibiotics. The whole deal. He was, he was really hurting man. And that's no joke. I mean he had the fight with Tony. I was out for six weeks. I couldn't do anything. I was, I got stabbed twice, but I got it once and they caught it real early when I got it the second time. The second time barely even affected me because it caught it so early. But the first time I got it, I got on the heavy medication and man, I was like dizzy and I wasn't even train and I stopped training after I, I got on the medication. I just just, just hung around and I was just like, Jesus, the first couple of days on the medication, I'm dizzy.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       I'm like, I feel terrible. It destroys your body. I mean, especially when you talk to, I mean, you've taught so many microbiologists that, that tell you what it does to the gut flora. I didn't know back then either. I got it back in like 2010. What the fuck? Y'All don't know shit about gut flora back then. I literally didn't know what it was. So I just took the medication, just ate what I always ate. Took some vitamins like I always did and that was it. But I was like, wow, like lightheaded. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's no, it's no joke. Uh, none of the body and it's, that shit scares the fuck out of me, Marissa and staff and those fucking infections. They scared the shit out of me, man. Anything from within you? It's Kinda, it's Kinda scary. Yeah. That was fucking little monsters. Just want to take over your body and eat it.

Speaker 1:          01:56:00       You know, that's what it is. There's more of them than there are of us. I mean there's more, there's more bacteria in your body than there are human cells. Yeah. I mean it's, it's crazy to think about it, but it, but it just, it's all about balance. You know what I mean? You, you careful with your diet. Like do you take in a lot of probiotics and, yeah. Especially when they can't make very, very careful or maybe outside of it. Recently I've been going a lot more, uh, Kido a little bit, you know, I still eat carbs obviously because I have to for to have that explosion still. I feel like, just think you do, I think you have to eat more carbs and you probably still stay key to genic. I think that when people look at carbs and they say like, you only have 25 to 50 grams of carbs during the day.

Speaker 1:          01:56:43       Like that's great if you're not doing two a days and fucking wrestling and run and hills and shit. Like you body probably needs more carbohydrates than that. Yeah. I mean definitely. Uh, and that, that's kind of where I try and supplement it, especially before I trained, you know, trying to eat more carbs and then I kind of cut them back towards the end of the day. Is it, what are you eating? A lot of chicken is a lot of, uh, because I, I can't eat fish or shellfish. So a lot of chicken. A lot of, uh, yeah, largely. Yeah, completely. Oh really? Wow. Yeah. It's a lobster shit. Yeah. I mean, I just convince myself it takes like shit anyway, but it doesn't, I mean I could, I could look at it, I'm sure with melted butter. Ooh. It tastes like melted butter. Oh, it's so good. Lobster with either melted butter on like some, some grass fed steak.

Speaker 1:          01:57:31       Well that was pretty fucking good too. I love to cook. I love it. Cause I mean, I think there's a real art to cook it into. Uh, that could probably be me and another life. A chef. He was saying that one person, that's a hard to it. Right? Yeah. I would love to, uh, you know, eventually maybe we'll see. I Cook a lot. I love cooking and it makes me feel good, man. I like, I like knowing that I prepared a meal together. It's just, it's a nice thing, especially if it's healthy and especially when you, you know, I don't, I don't get people that are, I mean, I don't want to say I don't get Vegas. Like I have a lot of friends that are Vegan and, and you know, I never kinda down, but the fact that they don't want to eat meat for, there are certain people, like my brother tried to do this too. He's like, he don't want to eat meat because he's like afraid of the animal, you know, or feel bad for the animal itself. It's just like you said, we've got more not us sales then we do us sales. Like we're all the same shit. You know what I mean? Even the, even the animals like we are the same, you know? So I mean it's the same as the plants don't want animal cruelty. I mean, I think of course that's what most, the, the most noble aspects

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       of becoming a Vegan is to avoid animal cruelty and factory farming. And I think that that in that way, I agree with them. The real problem with vegans is that there's a certain percentage of them that are just fucking idiots and it's just a certain percentage of any group of people. It's not most vegans, most vegans are kind people. It's a certain percentage of them that are using being a Vegan as an excuse to be a fucking asshole. And that's what it is. And they just, they have this thing and most of them use Vegan in their screen name. They always have like the vegans a part of their identity and then they attack people who aren't vegans. There's a few people that have followed. I literally go to their Twitter page and just watch them attack people who aren't vegans. Yeah. I mean it's crazy to watch. It's just like that's all they do.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       And, and like you said, it's, it's, that's why I don't want to say like I don't understand Vegas cause that's just people in general. You get that. Yeah. You're going to get that in any walk Sjoberg

Speaker 3:          01:59:35       be fucking idiots. And it's almost like when I've said that, like veganism is sort of a religion. It's an ideology in the sense of the way some people practice it that they want to go after. There's some people that are Catholic that Hate Protestants, right? So they think the Protestants are the enemy. And then this is just, I mean this is obviously something that went on for a long time in human history, but I think it's just groups of people get real tribal. And then, you know, the fucking Yankees hate the red sox and this is just how it goes. And these people just decide that you're on the other team, so fuck you. And no one can see any middle ground. You know, there's this guy from this restaurant, uh, antler from Toronto I had on last week and these people are protesting his restaurant, these vegans.

Speaker 3:          02:00:20       Oh, I seen that. They want him to put a sign in the window saying something like, no animal should die so that we live and it's not our right to take their lives on like, and so they're like the protest every week until he does it. But he's not going to do it. Yeah. So what the fuck are you doing? Like what is this like where's this, they've just asked. There's, there's, there's an ideological battle going on, you know, and they're not, it's not, it doesn't, it's not a thought, well like examined objective thing in my, in my opinion.

Speaker 1:          02:00:51       Yeah. But it's so natural though, like you said, is it's almost like communities [inaudible] you know, is, is you have your, your, your thoughts. I've got my thoughts and we're part of two separate communities and it's just like with anything else, I think that integration between the two and that balance is like the most key to everybody really. You kind of will grow everybody, you know, the, the, the bounty hunters can learn something from the vegans. Just much the vegans can learn from the bombing hunters. You know what I'm saying? I think so too. You know, and I think that really the problem is when people don't want to hear the other side and they want to shout people down, they don't, they're not willing to listen. And there's, there's common ground across the board. And some of it probably is just learnt, I think a lot about like how you grew up.

Speaker 1:          02:01:35       And I think it's important to like understand that it's like I said, just to go back to march, how old it is, just that's the way I grew up and that's what I understood. But when I look at like my dad, you know, like my, my dad didn't have his dad so, and he was out the house by 15, you know, he and I try and put myself there sometimes being a 15 year old kid that didn't have a place to go. Like, what are you going to do? And the only people you see around you is, is drug dealers and, and in, in on us. So like a lot of it I give credit to him for sticking around for me because I would have no, I've hit people over Todd to hit. Right, right. You know, you know what I mean? Uh, and that's why people do it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       Because those people that are doing that are just like you and me, everybody's, we're all just human beings. And we very genetically and we vary, but we very more bar environment, how much love we get. Yeah, yeah. That, that's a, that's a big part of it is like it's just the culture is, it's just, you know, and I think it stems from one culture being separated from others and not having that integration. Then you get that like even more of a disconnect and then once you get the even bigger than, you know, it's, it's all like downhill, more insecurity, which leads to more tribalism and it's, the whole thing is just, it's so disappointing that people still operate like this, but I think people were opening up to that more now than before. I just think it's a slow process. Slowly but surely, slowly but surely we still working at it.

Speaker 1:          02:03:04       Yeah. Know we were talking before about the Rosa parks picture out there. That wasn't that long ago man. No, no, no. It really wasn't in it. And that'd be the thing with certain, there's certain white people too that just be like, all right, just get over it already. And it's like, come on, like it, they didn't have to get over it. Exactly. They don't understand. Then you don't, you truly don't understand. Uh, and you've don't even like take the time to try and understand their tribal to, they'd talked to other people that say the same shit and like, yeah, well, and they'll just start rattling off the statistics about the instances of crime in the black community and how the Asians don't do this, but the blacks do. It's like, it's fucking cultural. If you don't think it's cultural, you haven't been enough around enough people and it does not go back.

Speaker 1:          02:03:50       A lot of generations. It's like you said, the parts is not very long ago. You know, my dad didn't have his dad. He didn't have that person to teach him what not to do and what to do. You know, it's, it's, that's a, that's a, that's a hard road, especially for a young, like you go back earlier, like young guys get delusional real quick. You know, they feel invincible. He felt like, oh, I can do this and I'm never going to get caught. You don't have that voice of reason to tell you right from wrong when you, when you that kind of age and it's because he didn't have his dad and then why didn't have his dad because he didn't have his dad. You know what I mean? And that only goes back two, three generations. And you know what's crazy is you are talking about 1865 is when slavery was abolished. So we're talking about a small amount of time in human history where there haven't been slave. So all your isolation when you, you felt as a kid where you felt separate from the people that were in those, the miles

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       that were higher than yours. Think about that times a hundred is if you were a slave and maybe a million remediate, insurmountable gap between a slave that has no chance of ever not being a slave. And someone who can go to school wherever they want and travel abroad abroad and do whatever the fuck they want. And then the idea that some of these white people think that these people should just get over it with the amount of time is so fucking short. You're talking about we just had black panther, the lifestyle, we just had it beat Avatar. It's beating

Speaker 2:          02:05:13       one of the number one biggest movies of all time. Stupid, big. That should help. Believe it or not, I really think it would help. It was a beautiful movie and it was a beautiful movie to describe. Even like when you say 1865 I feel like we so disconnected from even that, and this is, I've talked to a lot of people about this, the difference between being called a black American and African American, you know, I don't, I hate being called an African American. I just, that's what everybody says, but we know it's just bothers it. Taped it to me, it, it makes you seem, because you put me in Francis' next to each other, Frances and an African American, you know what I mean? He's, he's from Africa. He has ties to African. Who else is in African American? Elon Musk. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Really when you were ill. But I think even more now it Kinda like I just, why can't we be, the black comes in so many different shades. You know what I mean? And this is African obviously, so maybe black Americans a better way to put it. But Africans have ties to African, you know what I'm saying? Like black American slavery, like we feel, I feel we should have our ties in America. Like I should be proud to just be in American, not be called the an African American woman.

Speaker 3:          02:06:27       Well it's with every generation. I mean it's, it's going to take a long time before we just abandoned all this nonsense and just treat people based on who they are as a human being. But my grandparents came from Italy and they were treated like dog shit. And my grandfather always talked about the racism that he encountered when he came over from Italy to America. And they didn't think of Italians as white people. Now they think of Italians is white people 100% and Mexicans are experiencing that. Like, you know, if you're from Spain, you're basically white. Like, nobody thinks of a guy from Spain as being like, you don't think of in the same way you think of Mexicans, but one day all that shit will go away. One day we'll get past this, whether it's who knows how many generations it will take. But I think it's changing now because of the Internet.

Speaker 3:          02:07:15       I think there's, there's, there's definitely like more hate groups that consolidate and they'd get together and they, they, they, you know, they, they live in an echo chamber online. They talk, you know, and they agree with each other. You see it on Twitter. And Twitter's trying to stop that. And maybe that's misguided because maybe it strengthens it. But I think that ultimately is the ability to exchange information is going to allow more and more people to compare notes and, and, and understand that there's no, there's no benefit to describe or to, to, to thinking of people as being inferior or superior or better or worse. We're just all different. But we're all human. We're all just humans

Speaker 2:          02:07:52       of all the same. I mean really, you see that when you, when you see people, you know, you can really see somebody that you really know them. You really see them. Yeah. It is. We literally all the same

Speaker 3:          02:08:04       but all different too, because that's one of the beautiful things is that you, you see these little different aspects of individual's personalities, but to lump people in a group, Oh, you know, you're a Chinese guy. Oh, I know what the fuck you are. You're this, oh, you're an African guy on what the fuck you are. You're this. No, that's nonsense. There's a broad spectrum in each and every classification, but at the, at the end of the day, we're all the same thing because we're all just people.

Speaker 2:          02:08:27       Yeah. Wait, what, 100% I mean, it's just when you talk about heaven, like pride in, in, in it I feel like helps a little bit more if I, if I identify with like as a black American, you know, instead of, instead of like an African American, it's just see what you're saying. You know what I mean? I feel like I said a little more, you know, I just look different, you know what I mean? Like I'm more integrated and it would give me more pride to beat it. You know what I'm saying? And, and I think that's still, you were obviously all the same in there needs to be integration, but you still have to have some type of identity. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Yeah. I mean, and I think that the movie in itself did a good job. Uh, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:09:09       I just went back to Black Panther, Black Panther. I think it did a great job in describing like the differences, there are differences between the black community and the African and African Community. You know what I mean? Or African Africa itself and it, because you get that, you get that like anger, you know what I mean? Like that's like the stereotype is like the black angry black man. But some of it stems from not no one where you're from and not having that core identity. And I feel like we can just do that again here in America as black Americans instead of,

Speaker 3:          02:09:46       I hope. Yeah. I hope what it represents is a, it's a meter to register that racism is dying. Yeah. And that this is, this is also people in, there's a lot of like white people that were going way out of their way to go see it because they wanted to show everybody that they're not racist. But I think that's good too. Yeah. Ultimately it's, it's showing that this is something that people recognize as a stupid problem and we should get past it.

Speaker 2:          02:10:13       It took God damn long enough. You done, I mean, what, we're probably going to be telling this to our grandchildren and they're still going to be experiencing some of it. And then there's going to be something new comes out and be like, God, we just now doing this. Like, you know, that's the way it's just going to be. Uh, but for me personally, you know, he's just eight cause everybody, every kid wants to be a sober here. I'm like, oh, how are you doing? You know? So

Speaker 3:          02:10:36       a lot of them, you can be half of the empire and be blade.

Speaker 2:          02:10:39       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, but played was like a hit man. You know what I mean? It goes back to what you see around me. If I only see the, the, the drug dealers and the, you know, in every, you know, there was never a black superhero and it was like, all right, well shit. All right. You know, we didn't go up there, Huh? Yeah. And it portrayed us as scientists or, you know, it was a loud, I just

Speaker 3:          02:11:00       white get over it guys. That doesn't register for you cause they're all white. Every fucking superhero. Batman, spider man. Even the Hawk is white oak

Speaker 2:          02:11:08       first. Yeah. And I mean, I, and I, I get it from a lot of it. I mean there's just, it's just culture. You know what I mean? And it's not better or worse than one thing or another. You know, there, there's Hawaiian culture, there's, there's, you know, it's just culture and it just, that needs to be celebrated too, because the more you celebrate culture, the more you can integrate between

Speaker 3:          02:11:30       all of them. Right. And then there's the real problem with, I don't want those cultures to go away. Yeah. I was in Chinatown in Boston this weekend and we went and ate dinner at two o'clock in the morning. It's Chinese restaurant. It's China town, right? Jamie? What that place was? China town, they got like fucking, uh, Alaskan king crabs and a fish tank. Like, how the fuck did you even get that here? It's still alive. All these fish on top of each other and they pull the fish out of the tank and cook it up for you. I mean, it's like they barely speak English. I mean, this is their culture and I want that to still exist too. You know what I mean? I just want them to be accepted

Speaker 2:          02:12:05       100% I mean, and, and that's the beauty about it. And I think you need to keep that alive. You know, there's two different spectrums to it. There's the, there's the, the person, it's just like, oh, just go ahead and get over it. Right. And there is a person that just like, okay, what you don't even have, like, they don't want even like, uh, like I did it or acknowledge your culture, you know what I mean? They just want to like, just shun it or just not, you know, just put it in a closet somewhere and you know that that's almost the, it's the opposite, but it's just as bad as just needs to be though.

Speaker 3:          02:12:35       A buddy of mine who lives on the big island about that, he's a white guy and he lives in Hawaii and he grew up in Hawaii and I said, did you experience a lot of racism against white people? He's like, no, cause I'm not a fucking asshole. And I said, that's what it is, right? It's like, yeah, man. He goes, you can't be a white guy coming over here trying to push your, uh, you know, mainland culture is like, this is the fucking culture dude. He goes, if you just accept the culture the way it is out here, he goes, they're not racist. Let's see if you can get a good, you could gonna run into a few, but for the most part you're

Speaker 2:          02:13:03       going to run into a few eight everywhere you go. Because people were like, you got to go back to it. Like people are fucking idiots in every walks of it. Uh, but for the most part it's always, you're not. It has no you good. Right. I mean, and this, it's the same way across the board. And I've kind of realized that as I'm, as I'm getting older, because before I just thought, you know, we've just what we are. Right. You know what I mean? I've got family members that only will ever see Detroit. They will only ever see those same blocks. They will only ever see the same people. And that's just what you think it is. And it's just like, oh, so much now there's so much, much more. And it's not that different that you think is different is it's different. But you know what I'm saying? It's not, it's not alien. It's just, it's just different. It's just different. It's not better. It's not worse.

Speaker 3:          02:13:48       One of the things that I really enjoyed about traveling so much with the UFC, as you got to see all these different cultures and you got to see all these different styles of life that these people live in and you know, you kind of like put it all together and you, you, it just gives you, I think this is one of the best things about traveling is that it gives you this more rounded perspective. Like if you lived in Italy, you'd be like one of these people, if this is how they live, they live like this. You know, if you lived in Dublin, you'd be like this, this is, this is their style of living.

Speaker 2:          02:14:17       Yeah. And it's, and it's important to acknowledge I think all those different styles until, you know, and of living. Uh, and that, and, and I think if you really want to like cure racism in American, all that, and it's just being open about it and just talking and, you know, people understand other people's upbringing is, and what they went through and what they do because that makes you understand it more if you try and just shun it away or just say if you even bring up the word black or white or it's anything like people get, you know, you kind of see it. Sometimes people get tense and it's just like, just, just, just be honest about it and just be open about it. And that will make it go away. It's not, it's not, you know, shun it.

Speaker 3:          02:14:57       Well, don't want to be uncomfortable. They don't want to talk about uncomfortable shit. So if something comes up that's a, well, you know, as a black man, you're like, oh, here we go. I didn't do it. Okay. I never had a slave. Okay. You know, and you're like, all right man, you just super uncomfortable with being uncomfortable. You, I think that makes you that more of the ass over there. You know, you're talking to a human being. If you really want to have a conversation with them, you want to know their actual experience. You know? And if their experience is as a Puerto Rican that came from Puerto Rico, that feels disc, a lot of Puerto Ricans feel super disconnected with the United States because they're not really United States citizens, but they are, it's like a weird thing. It's Kinda like, it's not really a state, but it's, it's of protected by the United States. And so they're disconnected. And there's a, like on the east coast growing up with Puerto Ricans, there's a weird, they have a weird alienation. If you don't want to talk to them and you don't want to hear about that from them, that's fine, but you're just going to miss out on that part of what life is for them. You're never going to get it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:58       Yeah. And all the things that they bring to it, and you know, the food that they bring that to different arts, you know what I mean? The different styles of fighting that they bring, the different dances, like everything is about the culture. You're going to miss if you try and just, you know, shy away from it.

Speaker 3:          02:16:13       Martial arts is a perfect example of like all these different cultures coming together as one boiling pot. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:16:21       Yeah. I mean, and, and that does help me get us one of the most beautiful things about it. It's just I can go over to Ireland and fight a Russian in Ireland and you know, is, it's different than going down to Brazil then find the Brazilian, you know, or something like that. It's just sure. But it's at the core of it is still is fighting. It's just different styles of, of being able to do it. But everybody does it. What's crazy to me is how when you go to these other places like Brazil or Ireland or something like that, like how rabid they are for their local people. Yeah, yeah. Well you find someone who's Brazilian in Brazil. I mean maybe it's relaxed a little bit now, but I was there for some of the earlier years as well. And I've made the mistake of flipping off the crowd before, uh, at the way is because, because Lou, you down there, uh, for Cisco Toronado Oh, bottom.

Speaker 2:          02:17:09       Yeah. So he, you know, three times a Brazilian kickboxing champion, a monstrous, that was one of the, at the height of his, you know, he's on a seven fight win streak. He was feeling good. He was, you know, Kinda had his labs were on until he was, he wasn't tough at a one 85 pound, two big gates, big guru. A hit like a truck too. But you know, before the way is they, they scream at you gonna die. And I'm like, all right, you know, I, I'm a shit talker. So you, you, you've talked that shit to be, I'm giving it back to you. I love loving it. It was a good Dewey too. I'm loving it, but I mean they were rabid for that when people were throwing stuff at me as I was walking out, uh, I kinda just threw my headphones in and just went to town.

Speaker 2:          02:17:52       But yeah, they got a lot of pride in Brazil and they love it. But lot around the world, a lot of the the, because I think they truly appreciate the art of what they do. And it is a representation of the culture there. You know, for sure what Jujitsu for sure, for sure. When they, when they get somebody that's Damien Maia, you know, they kind of stand behind that man because he represents the art of it or just MMA, a general, like they, they appreciate the art of it. Russia is appreciate the art of what they do, you know, the Sabo and you know, it's so deep rooted in a culture, uh, in a, in American is due to, I mean for the most part he's just, we don't get as behind our own fighters I think is, yeah, we have a certain amount of loyalty but we're, so this is such an ambitious country.

Speaker 2:          02:18:39       Yeah. Hello. Hey, you gotta win some money. Know we're shy talks of shit. And we're like, well listen man, you're doing all those things right now. Hello. I'm trying to do it slowly but surely. I think there was a good conversation too cause I think people understand you more now. Yeah. Get a better sense of who you are. I got, I got a couple of, you know, I've got a couple of layers to view you got to do. You do, Kevin. I really appreciate it, man. I really enjoyed this conversation puffers. All right. That's it. Fuckers. See Ya.

Speaker 5:          02:19:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:19:23       Hmm.
