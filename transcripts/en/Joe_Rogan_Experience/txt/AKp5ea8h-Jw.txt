Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Young Jamie [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Merry Christmas motherfuckers. Brendan sharp with the Gucci Shoes on. How dare you, how dare you, and he's got cammo with Polka dots. I want to suggest for you, it says blind on one shoe and love on the other. Oh Lord. How dare you even leave just for you. The shows you did much soccer. He liked those shoes. The shoes I wore just for you. It's a little bit of romance, a little bit of my style camera with Polka dots on it. The Day George Michael Died. It's like a good, it's good jacket to have on. What did he die of? He'd had a heart attack apparently. Yeah, that one was hard for me. Really fucking love that guy. That song freedom. That's what fucking jam. That song has like four parts. People don't understand that there's like, I think it's four, but there's every part is just amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       That's a great fucking song. I'm a little too. I wish I could play it be we. We'll definitely get kicked off of youtube if we play it and we put it on Youtube. But there's, there's that video that they made with all those supermodels. So Christy Turlington and all those, all those, uh, Naomi Campbell and all those different supermodels in their all wandered around and there's, they're singing the song, they're like lip sync and hence the video. Yeah, it's fucking amazing. Yeah. I just know they'd wake me up before he coco that's in zoo lander. He had some ridiculous songs, you know, I think freedom is the only one I ever like. I didn't like, you know, like wake me up before we go, go, come on. That's a terrible, there's the video. It's awesome. Did you like, I want your sex. I'm not mad at it wasn't a fan of that.

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       It sounds like these are fucking shot. The kids. Awesome. He's so good on his knees with a undercover cop or something like that and, and no one gave a shit like no one gave me. She was loud about good. Who Cares? So wait a minute, here's my problem with that. What the fuck did the undercover cop say to get him on his knees and suck his Dick Restroom? No. No. How did it start off? It wasn't like, Hey, I bought those lakers. No, he was probably like, Hey, you want you to dick suck. I'll suck your Dick. You suck mine. Like he probably said something probably don't say Suck Dick. They probably got code word code words Woodward's right. You want some sausage, Bro? What'd they say? We're looking for Bro. I looked for some friendship. Friendship. Great. I got some friendship boy. Yeah. Do you remember when that, um, that Sam, was he a senator or congressman or some shit? That guy was an anti gay

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       crusader. We always, my favorite dudes got caught in a bathroom stall in like Minneapolis and he was doing that foot tapping thing. They have like a code Morse code for gay. He tap your feet four times and dudes and let you into the stall and you suck each other off. Larry's grades are in the dude's right. Kind of dudes are into dudes when these kinds of dudes are in dudes. Yeah. But I think if I think it generally, what did you watch modern family. You ever watch? No. Do they have, it's a few families and have a gay family. Uh, they have two dudes and they adopt, they adopted a girl. She's an Asian girl. But those guys, there's been a couple episodes where this is on ABC modern family where uh, the gay couple at some college boys move in next door and then one of the guys is like hanging out with them and he feels like he's in college again and he's partying with them and he kind of has a crush on one of the guys, like the main guy and his husband.

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       It's like you gotta crush blank they're talking about and he's like, like, no, I don't have a crush. But like it's obvious that he does and it's okay. That's fine. That's fine. No, I know. But if it was a heterosexual couple, no, that would never be a situation like that. Oh, they've done that before. Take a pilot, a couple. I had a crush on someone's wife for sure. For sure. A hot neighbor moves in. Right. But it is like where the guys like admitting that he has a crush on the neighbor's wife, like latently, is that what you're saying? No, it's more like a, you can tell there's, there's a heterosexual couple in the Sitcom and a bunch of girls move in next door and then the guys hanging out with the girls and he has a crush on one of the girls and it's okay with this wife.

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       She thinks it's kind of cute. That's weird. Right? That would never happen. I'm confused. Is the husband, I never, never watched the show. So help me out. Is the husband gay? I don't know what you're saying. That's a gay couple. So it came up a gay cop and a young and a young college kids move in next door and one of the guys, one of the gay couples crushing on the guys that were one of the guys that moved in next door and it's kind of a cutesy crush. Oh Wow. And they're really blatant about it. Like he comes over and there's like these moments of like he's being flustered and I have nothing against that. But I'm just saying you would never see that in a heterosexual couple on ABC now on ABC. Well I think some hardcore stuff right there. I think even though a lot, what does that mean? Well, a lot of times gay couples will take like traditional sort of almost husband and wife type roles. Like it's really common for sure. One of the, one of the guys makes all the money and the other guy sorta stays at home and maybe they even adopted kid and he like raises like a mom. Like yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       like it's so, but I think ultimately we still accept that gay guys are guys and the guys are just going to be different. The same as like two girls becoming lesbian. They're not going, I mean it's like people aren't asexual if they're gay, you know? So people becoming lesbians, they would probably have a different attitude about monogamy than people becoming gay. I would just imagine. Yeah. It seems like overall lesbians are like, they're, they're letting love in, they're monogamous. It seems that when it seems like gay dudes are like open about not being monogamous and Nicola [inaudible] I don't know too much. I don't know too many lesbians that where I've gone deep into their life. More monogamous. It seems like generally lesbians or more girly and monogamous love. I feel like super weird about asking that kind of shit to a lesbian, like a gay dude.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       I could ask a gay dude, they're like, Justin Martindale. I could ask that dude anything. Generally wilder ride, they're like, yeah, guys are like guys and girls are like girls, whether they're lesbians or gay dudes. You right. That's what the girls like a super like masculine, like, like a male. Uh, butchy gay girls generally still don't feel comfortable asking him. Like, you know, like how it works. They might get offended. There's not lesbians meeting each other and bathrooms. It's not girls doing that. Right. Generally it's usually these, they push each other into a stall and they started making out the heterosexual world. What percentage of strip clubs in the United States are for men? Well, there's a lot more [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       There's like one chippendale's, the county shit. You got to do some research and if they're only open on, you know, you gotta make your reservations and shit the fucking like, it's a different experience. Like when girls go to see men strip, they scream, they scream and they throw money in the air, they get crazy and they'll rub their face on the dude's dicks. Like girls at Bachelorette parties, they go, fucking ma'am. Is it because they don't go as much? Like as often, you know, in the agreement they could go off on bachelor parties and they're not. Yeah, they're not going to say shit. It's like what happens at the Bachelorette party stays there. Right. I had a friend of mine who I used to do taekwondo with that was a male stripper, two friends of mine actually. One was his young Puerto Rican kid and the other one, this is older white dude and the older bite to it was a really nice guy and very smart guy, but he was like over the top. Strange Big Jack. Was He shredded though? Jack Black Belt. Black Belt martial artist. He was a big Jack Dude, you know, but he was telling me, he was like, these women, they go fucking crazy. Like it gets really scratching column and she just sucking tech daughter friends.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       The girls who were getting married, we just suck his dick in front of their friends, cut to the guys strip club to dudes by himself in the quarter, all quiet as flushing fucking strip clubs when it was dead as fuck. I worked those Saturday day shifts, that shit is, you open up at 11 and there's one girl and no dude's this weight. You're looking at the security cameras to see and then one guy walks in, boom knee sit there and he's, it's Saturday and one 15 girl. She's fucking in Shitty Shit and I'm sitting there playing depeche mode and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       It was dark big. My friends like, dude, you're so lucky you were in a strip club, just origins going on and I'm like, dude, you get me a job, I'll just pick up cokes. Larry said, man, you're so lucky. I'm like, ah. But then ended up moving up and getting good shifts. You just wait for the Nike Jan? Yeah. When you first get in, you got the worst shifts. Saturday day, Monday day, Saturday day darkness, just dead. There's a UFC fighter is a stripper for awhile. Crunchyroll Detroit superstar. Yeah. He's over in Japan now. He's fighting for a rising. Oh, that's right. Yeah. He's over there now. He was American ripper. He's a funny dude, man. He's got a hilarious mustache now to follow his instagram. It's awesome, but it's just him shooting things. He's a fucking sadness. He used to fight in UFC. Yeah. Dan cruickshank probably run through more rounds of ammunition than anyone in this entire town in a year.

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       Fuck yeah, he's crazy. He's out there shooting shit constantly does instagram. It's all just him gunning things down. He's a wild motherfucker dude. He's fun to watch fight. He's a good fighter. He know. He was getting more and more comfortable with keeping fight standing and is when he became more and more comfortable keeping fight standing. Then you get to see how good his kickboxing skill is. He's a really good kickboxer. Really good. I know I say kickboxing mean is boxing. She'll at least the traditional martial arts basically, right? Like what was his, uh, his original background, karate or taekwondo. It, it's really, really good man. Really good kicker. And so like, you know, when a guy like that makes that transition hilarious. Jack Jacked with a candy cane Roos Dick, let that go back to that Jamie. It's fucking, you be like, look at us. Look at the first one you see.

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       The first one you see is if you click on that video, it's Darrin cruickshank just fucking going crazy with a machine gun. He's just fucking shooting things constantly, man. This dude, oh dude. If the fucking shit goes down, go to Darin crookshanks house and ask if you can get it. He's a fucking look at another video looking at, he's got a picture of all these Japanese girls staring at his package lasering in on his dick like agenda is what they're doing. Then he's killing it out there. Whoa. I mean that's a hilarious picture though. He's a funny dude, man. And I don't see, I don't think the UFC figured out how to, how to recognize that. You know what I'm saying? Like how many dudes that you see fight or like kind of almost like the on the outside it's like the bland, like everyone's the same because you don't get to know them.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       You don't get to know like all their weirdness. So you know, if it's differently, it's flat, it's flat. So you need a story but on a reason why to tune into the fight crunch has a great story. He's a great story man. Do you think some people, um, had wore certain shorts and you recognize them by their shorts, like with soccer, rob, but he had the warrant, the flames and now, now that, uh, everybody's going to reebok, it takes away some, a little value if what you're saying is correct. If it said adding personality adds value to the fighters, which adds value to the show. Correct. Hundred percent. So actually letting them and encouraging them and letting them get a rash, guards and shit. You want to win. You want to be the fight of the waiters or rash guard. Fuck yeah, it's not a problem in women's mma.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       I don't see why it would be a problem. And men's MMA. Tell him, show me the logic there. They, they should encourage fighters to, uh, where different Shit Melvin can imagine spots. I know that would grip. Oh Shit. Girls. Girls are wearing rash guards. Yeah. I mean that's rash guard. We'll fucking help your grappling for sure. It's a big factor. It's a big factor. Yeah. Uh, why they don't allow, I mean, they just haven't really thought about it. No one's actually just sat them down. It's all the best. Melvin manhoef when he fought k one, he wore them gladiator type art and cloudy. Yeah. Do you ever he, he started, started wearing those things, you know, start, it started that we stumbled Mcdonald. I'll go you one better. Alexis Arguayo. No, not a wreck. Stark whale. A Dennis Alexia. Alexia used to fight it. A grass skirt straight up. A straight up Hawaiian grass skirt. Mcdonald had like straight spartan. How bout, how bout Shinay Yucky when he was wearing them yellow tie to the rainbow. He was known for a statue. Couldn't wait to see what's new about collarbone and look that scary to watch that

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       shit allow that. They shouldn't encourage that. They're not cleaning product. Dell had those blue shorts, the iceman shorts, the pink ones. That's the personality. If they wear uniforms, they don't want to look more like every other league though. But it's a man on man. It's personality on personality. It's one, one dude. So his personnel, just one dude, that person, even if it's for dudes, all their personalities, you know, once you get to know him, they become important, you know? So the more you understand everybody in this case just to fighters, I also think that making it, I mean if you want to have a company that sponsors it, that the two aren't mutually exclusive. It's not like a company can't sponsor it and still have dope shorts that are different for each fighter. We have someone design their own stuff. You don't have to have, you know, the same like you have read and I have blue, like why correct.

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       It doesn't matter. Everybody knows you're you. Everybody knows you're you. Like what? Who are we confused? Like do we, who's the Red Guy? The right guy on top? Who's the blue? The WHO's winning? Well, I just feel like it takes away from the sport when you make everyone looked the same like in the nfl or something like that total because what people buy into and fighting and it's true with box and it's true with mma. They want to know why they should watch the fight. Cause you can put a fight on access tv if you don't know the fight. If you know nothing about them, they don't get, they get the ratings. But he loves cowboy. Yeah, exactly. His, his story, his story. We know, you know we know John Jones story now because this has been going through all this crazy shit and we know cyborg story and it could take to kick this thing off whether you want to talk about or not and you let me know.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       But with Amanda Nunez, imagine just put yourself in her shoes right now. Imagine having the biggest fight of your life ever and the the, the fight. Everyone's looking for a specialty or female fighter because you get so much notoriety. You get all the camera's pointed at you people, you finally get to hear your story and she has a great story and then he can't do interviews. There's none of that. There's no promotion. We're not going to show your videos, can't do interviews. There should be no open workouts. Imagine being her right now. Like what the fuck? Well, the good news is she can concentrate on the fight and just constant. The the would always do that. I understand that and the good news for Rhonda is that she can also just concentrate and the fight, but she doesn't have to do any of these interviews. I liked that, but I don't like is, I feel like we have to respect what a champion is and it doesn't matter if you're the most famous person, you're still the champion. And we, we are the champion of a giant organization like the UFC. And how about she's the first openly gay women's MMA champion ever or amazing stolen champion. I'm a champion. There's never been an openly gay mma champion and she's fucking bad ass. It's not like she doesn't have a highlight reel and it's not like she's grabbing a hold of these girls and just sort of winning by staying on top and do nothing. So there's no highlights you can pull. Oh, she knocks girls out

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       and choke them unconscious. She's very good. So it's exciting. It's an exciting technical match up. It's an exciting story with Ronda coming back after being out for over a year. There's so much exciting shit, but to concentrate only on one person to sell it. I understand that that person is huge. I understand that person's the biggest person. She's probably right up there with connor. I would go. They both go back and forth. What do you think conor is bigger? That's not an argument. I would, um, I would agree with you. I would, I would lean towards that. My point is let's, with one victory, she could get launched right into that, that place again, I think it's a weird thing, man. It's like you're, you're a super talented person who's also this giant personality figure. It's, it's, it's more than just a fighter, right? It becomes his personality figure, especially for common like that, that his whole shit talking and marketing and he sends out a tweet to sell the fight.

Speaker 4:          00:18:49       Part of being a fighter is selling the fight. See what you want about floyd mayweather. There's not an interviewer camera heat in it looked towards to sell that Pacquiao fight cause in the end it helps the company helps. It puts more money in your pocket, it helps sponsorship everything. You can't say anything about floyd unless you were one of those girls. You smacked that well, but it's part of the Gig. You, you've got to sell the fight. So for me, and I think Rhonda is the favorite in this matchup, but she has to create these scenarios where it's me against the world. It's me against you. Sure she's creating and this, and this is a big marketing push. This is like, you know, this is the new owners of the UFC and this is this and this is the really banjo, but this is this really a cinematic thing that we're missing the boat on.

Speaker 4:          00:19:36       What would definitely mention the boat, the numbers will prove it. I bet you we'll definitely miss the boat on promoting Amanda, that that for a fact, but you don't think it was like a pretty exciting promo piece. I saw that Promo piece that got me fired up. I think the good thing is that it's like it's really exciting. Very well done. Cool thing. You gift, it's a garage door. You think this fight has as much promos? Say UFC two oh five in New York. No, no I don't. Or The conor fight cause I didn't know because no one's doing interviews. Yeah, no I 100% completely agree with you to that point but part of me likes, I want to see what happens when the pay per view numbers come out because part of me likes that the fighters aren't going to be bothered. I don't think you need to bother them as much as they get bothered.

Speaker 4:          00:20:20       I think when connor was, was pissed off about it when all those pissed off button will always different fighters who were doing these crazy tours are pissed off about this promotion thing. The, the idea about it as you trying to get the word out to as many people as possible, but I don't know if like that the price that they pay and being distracted from their training. I don't know if it's 100% worth it. You're talking about a world tour where he's like, dude, come on, I'm coming off the loss. Nate Diaz is a tough fight for me. One 70 I need everything

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       I can do to, to get this fight and get my mind right with Rhonda helps. Do you think that it helps these, these big promo tours? Um, yes and no. I, I, you know, I don't know if you need to go all around the frickin world and promote it, but there needs to be some sort of, um, publicity done. The for, for Rhonda especially,

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       I think her as a role model for females. You can't get kicked in the face, take your ball and go home. We want our champ to be like connor or someone where they go, I want back in there, man. Gimme gimme the fuck back in there. I need this. I think that it's cool that obviously Rhonda doesn't want all that shit. She's as famous as you can be. She doesn't want that. And someone just said, okay, you know, they'd let her just have her piece and focus on the fight. I personally don't really watch interviews. I don't watch that press, so I don't even know how important it is. All I care about is that fight. That's it. Once the fight happens, give me a little prod you a little promo. Give me a little our promo. It doesn't have to be like, you know anything fancy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       We're balls deep in it though. For the casual fan. My Dad's a casual fan. He has no idea she was fighting this Friday. I don't know. So for the casual fan, that's where I would think that it would make a big difference. People will watch espn and well that that's who buys paper views Joe, because to get that, to get that 60 $70 and here casual fan, they need to be sold on. It sounds like, it sounds like you own a piece of the UFC right now. You're making good points. Making very good points. I'm just being fun. No, no, I hear you that well, but you are making very good points. My, my issue is in, in Ron can do her thing, but you can't, it's a conflict of interest. Here's my, here's my cousin called me Gregor. Right. Cause conor goes, dude, I'll fly to New York and do a press conference, but I'm not going to vegas. Cool. You're not fighting. Right. Ronnie goes, I'm not doing shit. He goes, cool. Different different owners now.

Speaker 5:          00:22:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:42       Different owners, however different approach. I mean it's a different business and in the amount of things are changing. They're changing the change. Joe, but also wme who owns the UFC manages Ronda Rousey. Yeah. They don't manage conor mcgregor. Right. So there's a conflict of interest there. Well, um, it depends because it's just a business decision. The only people that should be upset or probably the other people, what cody garbrandt and dominick Cruz aren't restricted from doing any interviews. Right. They're doing everything they can to sell the fight. That's a problem. It's good. They're going to sell them for me. That's for fuck's sake. I for Fox steep in it for short balls deep. The casual fans going, I'm not buying, I'm not spend $70 for those small guys. Now to me it's the number one five. You know, to me it's the number one flight on the card. I love cody is my number one fight rendered wants his promos. No, he's right. He's right. No, no, no. What I what? I wasn't added to the UFC to keep growing and uh, it, it comes with the territory you got to sell yourself. But do you offer the fighters? I'll don't you think that they're respecting their wishes like Rhonda just wanting to be left alone. She is the exact reason why she's famous as she is. Okay

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       though. Wait a minute, but you don't have to only do press while you were in camp like that media exists after the fights, which is easy for, for everybody just talk after the fights. But during the training and preparation, it's a giant distraction is going to take a lot of time. It did a decision if someone's as rich and as famous as Rhonda is a decision to favor performance over finances. So like maybe she'll make less money but she thinks that she'll be more focused on a performance would be better. I love that. I love that decision. I think really well when you're a really wealthy, successful athlete like her, you can do whatever the fuck you want. That's what I think. I think when you get to a point where you get to decide whether you're going to focus on making more money and possibly being less focused and distracted and maybe tired or even maybe get sick cause you're doing a lot of traveling versus only dedicate yourself to training.

Speaker 4:          00:24:40       He do all the fucking videos you want. Put all the promos you want. I'm not doing shit for the next eight weeks. So then where's that? Who's going to sell the fight? If everyone has that mentality, does that, is that the rule now? You know what I'm saying? No, I don't know what you're saying because the old way is not the only way. You could do both ways. You could do whatever way you want. They can go side. They could decide that they're a little promo pieces that they could put together without interviews are enough. They could fly. I might be wrong. You know what, they could just fly to her for two days interview or at our training camp. That's what they did for telling me. And then they take off. Tony was in big, big, really never left big bear. They came to him.

Speaker 4:          00:25:16       It was no big deal. It's, look, she definitely could do that. Or she could say, no, I just want to completely focus and let's see how this works. Her thing is, is that she thinks the media backstabbed her and that's why she won't do an interview like they turned on and when she lost, she's a very emotional person. It's one of the reasons, one of the reasons why she's so good. I agree. But she's a very emotional, to me it sounded like my voice was cracking up. I swear it roadmap the Cryo or some conversation, Doug. Um, but, but to me it's, if you're a a Rhonda Fan, like when you break the site down, there's an that there's a huge x factor. What frame of mind is Rhonda? If she won't even face interview. Okay. Maybe. Or maybe that's, yeah, maybe she's the most folks she's ever been or maybe she just can't deal with the question.

Speaker 4:          00:26:06       The Fra after the last fight. We don't know. Well yeah, you, it's, she's the only one who knows, you know, or like you said, famous is fuck lives in a mansion a lot about Amanda. Oh yeah. What about little for her? She should absolutely be able to do as many interviews she won, but she might not want to either. She might want to say, hey, good. I'm going to focus entirely on fighting Ronda to look. This might be better. It might be better this way. It's just like we were talking about weight cutting before. It might be better if people didn't fucking cut way. Look up. God damn good. Kelvin gaslin looked against Tim Kennedy. Look up. Goddamn good. Donald cerrone looks Donald's walking around like 176 pounds.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       He's not cutting shit and he looks fucking amazing. He's head kick in Matt Brown, you know he's, he's running through every book. Tony doesn't cut that much either. Yeah, connor, 55 pounds. Those guys, man, they have an advantage. That's a big acid vantage. Wait, wait, cut. Yes, I agree hugely, but I think the way cut like the, I think there's benefits to it. Ultimately. Obviously you're going to be bitter when you get inside the octagon, but the performance hit that your body takes. Its super arguable at a certain level. There's a point of diminishing returns that a lot of these guys pass through, but then there's a few fucking examples. Like Damien Maia, Damien Maia cuts a lot of weight and he's just rushing people. Anthony Johnson and Johnson's cutting that much weight at two oh five bro. I think he might be 10 15 pounds. No Sir. You're really good at two 22 two eight guys.

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       I think he looks really happy as Ken, who's my offense as much. For a big guy like that though, for saying he's, I mean, 20 pounds, 20 pounds, 20 pounds is different when you're a heavyweight for light heavyweight. But he's, he's, he's lean too. That's true. He's jacked. Who's who's doing in March? A flight and Damien Maia, I don't know man. I think they're waiting to see the shadows. Woodley Woodley. If Woodley and wonderboy, you have a rematch. Woodley's campaigning for a fight with Nick Diaz, which I would love to see Woodley get fucking paid too. I like, I like what he's doing. I liked it. He's trying to get paid. She is just the big names to make money. I want to see it happen. I like, I like his initiative. I like it. You know, people are like, oh, you're just trying to get paid, bro.

Speaker 2:          00:28:20       Yeah. Yes. By the way, those are all fucking amazing fights. Like what are you talking about? You don't want to see him versus GSP. Yes. Tell people to lose your number. Tell them right now. Lose your number if you don't want to see that fight. He wouldn't want to see that fight. That's the sport though. You want the biggest name possible with the highest pay day because either way you're probably getting punched in the face. Hey, but also I want to see the runnable wonderboy rematch. I want to see that too. I do but I'm not upset with any of the other seds or GSP. I honestly, I'm even on it. I'm even on Diaz GSP or the wonderboy rematch. I won't be mad at you and wonder boys up. Bad motherfucker dude. And when he was in that guillotine and didn't and it looked like his head was literally going to be body, I don't know man. He Ha maybe his neck is so small. That's what tyler was saying that his neck is so small you got to like really squeeze it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:13       Someone else was saying that too. Like his neck is so small. Maybe he can like make more room because it's harder to get a really tight squeeze on it cause Woodley had some big ass arms make up for it. Woodley also said that he's got a little head so his head could pop out easier. That makes sense. Right? A small head myself. It's an advantage not will not when you get punched in the face, if you've got some crazy alex caceres do that has gotta be an advantage to the guy hanging on for real. Right? Yeah. I mean to Alex. Cause if you get Alex because Sarah's in a canteen, like there's a lot of shit he's got to go through on a shit. It's not like my head was like, Whoa, whoa. Remember having uh, they had homeboy and um, Kenna shave his beard.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       Oh that's right. A meal. A meal mic. You got a powerful beer cause it was called himself a meal. Meek forever. And then just the day before the fight, he told everybody was Mac. They're like, all right man. All right dude. Cool. Whatever you want. Do you have to ease that I bought just make one a mother fucker. Jesus Christ. Why is everybody having, why do we have to keep the dumb way of spelling shit that our ancestors who came over on rafts, they understand that you just can't make some shit. You can't? No, you can't. Well, you definitely to ease. Is he all right? It's not. It's just not. It's just not. We got rules. Motherfucker rules. Okay. We got rules for sounds rules man. I remember Roy being so pissed when he's fighting kimball, he want him to cut his beard. He's like, get the new advantage.

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       What if we get ahold of his neck? The commission was like, well I don't, it's Kimbo slice when I kinda this fucking beard. What do you want us to do man? So sad. I know the personality wars, you know, personality wars versus a, I mean look, he is Kimbo slice not beard is huge. You know the idea originally was that some hundred the beard protected you this ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense unless you have like some crazy Rastafari and wow fucking dreadlocked out beard. Like if you could have like a thick roped up, dragged, locked out beard, Caribbean Shit. Yeah. I think then you can make the argument, but who, what, what kind of a human is capable of growing the same kind of facial hair that you grow on your head. Does anybody ever grown? Jamie looked this up. Tapes. Anybody ever grown like a legit tait fletcher? A little bit. Right, but he needs to like roll that shit up and braid it. He does now take those. Yeah, braids it sometimes he's like that refereed to as that really long. Oh that's true. Just the referee the other night during a Mike Beltrani Mike, he's awesome. Yeah. Mike has, that's right. Mike has like ponytails cause he has picked face face pigtails.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       Mike's a cool guy. He's great guy. Very good referee to one of the coolest guys I know. Super, super good dude. Super good dude. And he pulls out mustache off being that cool. He's the only one. Everybody started growing that much cash flow going to be like slow the fuck down. Stood his background. It would make sense. He's a good dude man. No fee fund mma they lost and they can cut it because you could use that to choke him. Uh, yeah, I guess you could. Yeah. Or he can choke you with it. You know, if he gets on top of you get to Zeke eal with that. Go ahead and quiz up Brown. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I wonder how he rolls that. He do, you know, does he rolled that up? He's a brown belt and he's huge. [inaudible] sec guys. Big fucking deal.

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       He's not five, nine, no giant dude sons. Even bigger. Does he put it in like, um, like a chin been like a man bun thing? You'd have to ask, you'd have to put like a thing over it. Yeah, maybe in underneath the chin, but then again that would kind of get in the way. I would imagine the braids like could be avoided just like other kinds of braids and there's Rondo biting his braids. Well that was actually, it looks like. Okay. Yeah. So he just sorta ties at the bottom of it and like little rubber bands and shit. Great referee. That guy's on top of his shit. Does a lot of good ones, man. This is a good time for MMA. There's a lot of like super experienced guys that are just, uh, it's so important when you're watching a fight, when you think like a fight could be stopped and then, you know, and then the guy gets through it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       Fighters Millet too. When you're in the back luck, I mean they go, Hey, I'm be a ref tonight. There are certain guys you buy shit. I like who refereed a wonderboy and um, tyron, herb dean, right. What a great job or mccarthy. Pretty sure it's herb though. Those guys didn't on get out of credit, you know? Yeah. They know the fighters, you know, and they know that w how tough these guys are in the can be in those spots everywhere. Everyone's got the classic fuckups as a referee. I don't remember any by big John McCarthy. You don't remember Marilla Bustamante tapping out Matt Lindland twice. Oh, that's right, that's right. Morale booster. Madelyn in an arm bar tabs. He let go and he said I didn't tap. And then marilla got him again the next round with a good team. That wasn't a fuck up. That was like the dude ghost tapped or something.

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       You know, he lied, tapped and he said you didn't tap. Yeah, but that's not that big fight is a championship fight. But, but looking back, thank God. Oh standardly Yada. Denmark. Leon's a great job in that fight. Great job. Great job in that fight. Yeah. Yeah. He's great. He's great to, Dan's a really good guy too. And fucking giant. He's, he's a gorilla. Stir guy. Gives me a hug. I'm, I feel like he's my daddy. Me To sit on the fucking lap. But another really good referee, you know, who's another real, real good referee that, uh, Josh Rosenthal, very good. Hellier I hope. Prison. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He's out. He's out. He was awesome. Very good referee. He got caught up in some sort of pot thing like plants and shit on his house. Not good, whatever. But he's out now and he, I guess he's refereeing again for other organizations, but he was very good.

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       I don't remember him ever fucking up and really smart guy. When he comes to mma, knows a lot of his Jujitsu brown belt, I think under a, who's the under the, under Cesar Gracie? I think so. I think so. But he's a legit, one of the important, they train like Mccarthy's rolling all the time so they know what positions to look for. Transitions. It's kind of funny how those northern California guys are known as like real hard style Jujitsu guys. Like how Caesar and you know when you, when you start talking about like those northern California Jujitsu schools, how fun is always had a reputation of like if you go like a of frowning upon tapping, you tapped in front of house. That was the story. It can be totally blown out of proportion, but US training down, um, with Jacques, we heard, we heard the crazy stories about how if that, that he looked down on tapping like you gotta you gotta escape.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       Don't tap. How about Dave [inaudible], he's another one other than my mother fucker from the north of California. There's like that heart. He came from that same camp that hardstyle. It could be a total myth though. You know what? I mean, that's what we thought that we thought, man, those guys are so tough, but don't you break my heart? Don't like people have like a feel to them. Like you hear like, Oh, this guy's a half black buddy. Go, Ooh. Like that's, that's, that's uh, like one of those black bolts we'd go over. It was guys probably a psap beyond my shit. Yeah. He's a black belt is like, these are super aggressive style, right? Dave Camereo, Dan Camereo, like when you hear Hickson here, if someone's a hixon black belt, you go, Ooh, hundred percent. Whoa, okay on this guy's legit as fuck. You know, 100% legit it, there's no sh there's no, like, she hits it, especially when they're hixon black belts.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       They're really game too. Oh yeah. Like at the Gracie Academy of the, a lot of Hixon guys go up there. I mean, they are game, the chrome chrome's kicks and he said he's a cut above the elite. Like Hixon is, everyone says when they rolled hixon or you know, back in the day that they were just completely immobilized and dismantle, everyone has their hixon story. And you look at chrome, chrome, very few Jujitsu players like crone. Crone got a serious full guard, serious guilt guillotine and his full guard attacks. You don't see that that much in grappling and the more someone with a full guard that's dangerous. Crohn's got that Crohn's, Crohn's or a little bit different than your average elite. You should see his workouts. When I was doing a, a grappling competition chromos on at two so I trained with him for like a week at a school in Culver City there.

Speaker 2:          00:37:38       Dude, they would do these two, two and a half hour workouts. His Cardio was insane. What kind of shit was he doing? He would do this crazy warm up, crazy warm up and we go over position, position, position and then it was like a king of the hill. We'd match up and however long it took until someone got submitted, then the two guys would be at the end. Then the rest of the map with stare and watch those two guys at the end. Jesus Christ. It was intense. Super intense. Wow. And he does a lot of like nutty gymnastic shit too. Does that he does the breathing thing like his dad and at the end, crone and I were going against each other probably 15, 20 minutes straight. And they caught me an armbar. Wow. He's a, he's not, he's tiny, tiny. He says what's wrong with all monsters?

Speaker 2:          00:38:29       And then with my big ass, it was just arm bar and he's always training with nick and nate and he's training with animals for for a while now. It's been a while. It's been a month and it's looking like a strike is coming together. Yeah. He's looking, he's a special dude. Yeah. Very, very special dude in special genes. Their son, special jeans. Handsome Fella. Handsome little fellas structure with off space. Yes. Just like it's poplar, right? Yeah. Uh, but also he's just a good dude to be around. Yeah. Like you feel like you're around a Samurai. Very good dude. Yeah. Well he's legit as fuck, man. I mean, it's a, he's the rare exception to show me the man, the son of a great man. Great man. He's the rare exception. He has the mentality because you look at guys like, uh, who though Chavez Jr. You look at these guys who come from that kind of pedigree, it usually doesn't correlate.

Speaker 2:          00:39:16       Yeah, they're usually like kind of soft or they're missing a few things there. The discipline was not just not there. It just didn't quite have the same discipline as his dad, but he was still talented. Like to party though, don't you? Not like that. I think our parking's yeah, for sure man. For sure. Because I'm that Jon Jones party, there's partying and then there's John Jones bar. Well, you know, he's the son of like one of the greatest, if not the greatest with Mexican boxing champion of all time. Julio Cesar Chavez is a legend. When he fought Meldrick Taylor, remember that fight man? Meldrick Taylor was lightning limpic gold medalist during the heyday, the mark Braelin heyday. Remember those guys to that whole crew of Olympic gold medals. Pernell whitaker and Meldrick Taylor was just lightning. So just hit dude. These ridiculous combinations. Chavez just kept slugging away bobbing and weaving and rip it to the body and slugging away.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       Cause you ever see his fights outdoor and Mexico? Yeah, I've seen most of them. They're just like, it's like a fucking call a [inaudible] Algun o in Mexico, but back to the Meldrick Taylor fight. Let me, this is what I remember. This is what I remember. Controversy in the first fight. The end of the round, it looks, it looks like Meldrick Taylor was winning. He was, he was stealing the fight and then at the end Chavez last round was fucking him up, had him against the ropes and the ref stopped it. But that was only like two seconds left. Richard Steele, right? Did it go down like that? Yup. Yup. Two seconds left to the 12th round and he stopped the fight and he stopped the fight because Malik went down hard and he got up and he was fucking out of it and still looked in his eyes and he waved him off.

Speaker 2:          00:40:58       He said he would do it again too. He said, it doesn't matter if it's only two seconds off in the fight. He goes, I know this guy is not fit to fight anymore. He was like, he got stopped. He got him up. He looked at his eyes and Mel Giotto was looking at him and he asked him some questions and Taylor wasn't answering him and he's like, fuck this. A lot of that in box elder cause beaten him the whole fight, but in his credit, Richard steals credit. Myalgic tail was never the same again. Never the same after that fight. He was right. He was done. He just was right in front of him touching him, looking him in the eye. Let's see it. This is Cesar Chavez, Kaos Meldrick Taylor and this was a fight where meldrick speed and footwork who he was just, he was ahead. It was a head on the scorecard.

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       He was getting the better of him in the beginning of the fight that that ref stop not fight in your hair. Freddie Roach talked about, he goes, I wish my corner would have tossed in the towel or the referee would have jumped in way sooner and a lot of my fights. Yeah, well for, it's very loud. He took a lot of punishment, but if you asked him back then, if they, he wanted them to stop the fight, he might've said, no. Look how good Chavez was. Mike God, he was so good with his angles. He was our hero did. He was so good. Sorry. Here. How's the greatest Mexican boxer of all time? For sure. Right. It was better than now where you could learn so much watching his test. The greatest thing he throws in the thing he throws, he's like short and perfect. That was our chuck Norris.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       It was a bad, how to fuck comparing Chuck Norris. She was a bad motherfucker. I was a huge Chavez fan when he fought Greg Haugen. He was the guy that said, uh, yeah, he has got a, cause. He was like a g tech drive is all his opponents were taxi cab drivers. That's right. His son has skills. He just doesn't have that it factor. He's just not this guy. This guy's a different guy. This guy, the first of all, his son is a winger bombs, you know, and he's a, he's a hard striker. His son can fucking caissons. No doubt. He's a big boy. He's a Chavez, was a different kind of fighter. He was a much more volume fighter and would throw perfect technique punches and would never run out of fucking gas. Saint Lucie on you for 12 rounds throwing bombs on you and just never letting up talking about it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       Have you seen his interviews? Now? He's fine. Pretty legit. Well, I don't speak Spanish. There it is. You heard some here. It's with that right. Look at it. Take to the body. Look at that left Hook, man. Come on, let's get turn. And he turns him around and with that right hand, perfect right hand. God, look Meldrick Taylor's down and the referees counting him. He's eight, seven, six, five, four. These are you okay? You okay? And he has no idea where he is. He won't respond. Mel Gto doesn't know where he is. So Richard's still stops the fight. That is a correct call. Great job. We got mad. You're crazy. They're crazy. Cause they thought he was gonna win the fight. That fight was over, man. If they let him hit him again, he might've died, obviously not make me. You never know. It'd be, I shouldn't have said that, but you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       Like that's, that's what that comes from. It comes from when a guy's done. There's a boss who just died not just a few months ago in Australia, professional boxer. I like the fact that they're trying to, like, if you listen to hbo commentary, like guys will be like hanging in there in the fight and you'll heal. Max Kellerman say they could very reasonably make the case for stopping this fight. And I'm like, thank you. I know, right? Thanks. Before you can never ever heard that. I've never heard that. Even the NFL, there's the guy who got rocked Dick, man, I hope he doesn't come back. Hope he's all right to put them in the concussion protocol. Who was that dude that just quit on a, did he quit on Golovkin? No. Lowman Chanko no, no, no. Uh, check again. Sergei Luma Chang. He was even really getting rocked out. Like he was just out class and he's like, fuck this.

Speaker 2:          00:44:30       I'm not winning. I, whatever you wrote him on defeated. I'm just fucking done. You're talking about homeboy, Kell Brook. Yes. He was getting, he was getting, couldn't see out of his eye and his corn was like, no, we was fine. Golovkin yes, yeah, yeah. But to fight, well, the Kell Brook fight, um, was a little bit controversial. The Loma Chanko fight was much more controversial, right. Where most people were like, this is ridiculous. Yeah. Because he really was thinking, yeah, neglect. He just quit. And Nicholas Walters was undefeated before this, but he had, he had taken some time off apparently. And that was supposed to be like a big test for limit Chenko and then even Max Kellerman, he goes in the ring and he goes, you know, just, just as a box in kind of sore, usually go out on your shield, like you really weren't getting hit. And he goes, no, there was a, there's a left hand in that and that wobbled me.

Speaker 2:          00:45:17       And he's like, well, we can't, like, can you give us the time round anything? He's like, no, but I, I was hurt, man. That's why I stopped. And even, you know, Mac telling me see how many boxes of matches, it's like he's the fucking Joe Rogan of box. And he was like, dude, like this, this is going to hurt your career man. So they're saying all those years he put into finally establish himself and get this fight and then you quit and then there's really no damage. He just, it was like mighty mouse just all around. He didn't know what to do. He had no answer and just like, I can't fucking, I'm just going to get embarrassed. I think he was getting hit a little bit more than that. I agree with you. But I think Loma Chanko was really laying into him. Was it? Well what Brown did they stop at seven seventh round to fight the round before that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       So it was at the end of the seventh how does that work? Or is it the beginning of the seventh he doesn't come out to his corner. So it a 77 answer the bell, right? For the seventh so it was the six round Loma Chanko was just putting it to a man. It was just really getting on him and I think he, he saw the end, I was like, dude, he's like, I can't even hit this guy. I didn't have a problem with it. I was like, yeah, you're definitely never beating him as a, as a fighter. And most other other fighters will go, fuck that guy. Didn't have a fighter's heart that he shouldn't be in there. Yeah. I think, I think both arguments could be made. I agree. But I think, uh, I would lean more towards yours because like you never know. Like, look, Chavez is getting outclassed earlier in that fight with Meldrick Taylor and he never gave up.

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       He kept chipping away and people will define you based on how quickly you're willing to give up. But I think the skill level, you know, do you know who learned lemme? Chenko is dude is from outer space. He's an alien. He's a bad rush. Motherfucker. Russia, he says he should fight Russia. Oh wait. Triple H. No, no, no. You can thinking triple g trying to go off. Oh, sorry. Lemme Chanko is actually maybe more, it's more technical. It's more skilled for sure. Pull up Aloma Chanko a highlights, but joe, to your sale low, but chain, to your point, most skilled boxer in the world does no publicity. This is the video viewers. Well, he's 125 pounds like you were saying, but look at this. Look at these fucking, the footwork on this tickles. His angles are so filthy, so hard for people to hit him clean. He's just just so technical. Like he just pushes

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       dudes around looking. I mean he's, he's laying it to this dude. And you're ready for this. Seven. Five, yes. Seven fights. Seven pro fights. It just has so many amateur b, six in one, but wall. Look, walters hit him a couple of times there. I see. That's where I could see your argument much more. I mean, it's not like walters didn't occasionally connect. It's just for sure. Loma Chanko is connecting more than him walks up to him to make a decision to just opt out to look at that. Come on, man. This, you can't say he's not getting hit. He's getting fucking hit. Right. Right there. He got hurt right there. He's holding onto the glove. Lemme Chanko is all over him here, man. I mean it makes sense. He was a medal winner. He sees the end man. He's gold medal winner twice. Yes. Two Separate Olympics, right?

Speaker 6:          00:48:13       Yup. He sees the end. What do you mean he's cute? Keeps getting fucked up. That's why Walter is quit. You know his corn. Look at them in there in the corner. Dude, he's fucked up. He's fucked that he's also broke mentally too. He's like, I'm not, I can't compete with this guy. Yeah, and I just, I see everybody's point, but I see, I see his point too. At the end he looked like he was getting fucked. I wish you could've gotten into a frickin Bernard Hopkins. There was last week. We haven't talked about that right out of the hat. Oh yeah. You're a hall of fame at 51 check this out out of the F. Have you seen this? Here's one thing I haven't seen out of the ring. Boxing needs boxing me to do something boxing needs and do something about that ring thing that's not, that should never be able to happen.

Speaker 6:          00:48:57       Where a guy can fall through the rings, the ropes, and here you're talking about a guy who's been fighting for 23 something years. How long has hopkins been fighting and he can still fall through the ropes like you shouldn't have ropes. You should have some sort of a mesh inside the ropes. This is Joe Smith. Jr is ropes are now loose. Bernard Hopkins who falls through the ropes, ropes, ropes, Jesus Christ and lands on his fucking head and Smith is a bad motherfucker. Dude. This is a goal. This was a dangerous fight. Smith also has arms that look like a, like a popeye. Bad Guy, arms heavyweight. They're like too long. No long arms are like too long for his body. Get him here dude. He Fuck Bernard Hopkins Up. It was rough like this. Look at it and be fall time and do something. And that was the end of the fire right there.

Speaker 6:          00:49:42       Yeah, yeah, yeah. He fell on his fucking head. This is the worst part. Bernard kept going. He pushed me out the ring and they showed the replay. Then that Max in the locker room. He goes, what do you think happened was I got pushed. Man's do little shit. He just landed on his fucking head. That is a real clown. Right? But no, it's a real fight. He was just, Smith was winning. No, Joe Smith was winning the fight up until that moment. And then he knocked him through the ropes with an Abrie much. I don't know, man. I don't think, I think Hopkins has done cause that's dangerous. The way felt like that she fell and landed on his fucking head man. And no wonder why he's, he's, you can't hold him accountable for anything he's saying right now. That guy clearly landed on his fucking head after taking some really solid shots. You guys know the rule on that. If he get knocked out of the ring? No. 22nd, 22nd. Yeah. To jump back

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       in. Why, why did he have ropes? Look, man, that's why don't have a mesh in between those ropes where that can't fucking happen. But this guy never happen. But it does happen. It's happened before it happened in, um, uh, what's his name? Uh, Ray Mercer fight. Remember when Tommy, Tommy Morrison got tangled up in the ropes, his arms went through the ropes. You guys have fallen out of the ropes before he's fallen out of the road. This isn't the first time a huge fall. Yeah. Oh yeah. The camera man should be fired or beat when he went backstage. I think people can fall through the ropes. It just doesn't happen that often. But when you get tagged like he did and he stepped on his foot to Yo, dude, he got, he was getting lit up. Go back on a 79 just calm. Talk about that. No, I didn't even see it unless I'm retarded.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Look, look, look at this. Boom, boom, boom, boom. No, he didn't start charging. I'm retarded. I thought he stepped on this. It's hard to pay attention to everything in there, but that was a vicious fucking combination and the reason why he went through the ropes is because his legs were gone. They gave out when his butt was down and then he got clipped again and his body just went limp. He also went through the ropes because that left fucking hook from Rhode Island land. It's not a pushover fascination. Not The way you want to go. I'm telling you the worst part about that was him fallen on his fucking head. None of it's, that's horrible. That's horrible. How do they not have pads down there? How do they not have some sort of a like, you know that's possible. Why? If people fight on a platform, that's a bad at anything.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       I didn't have pads down. That's what they should do. They should absolutely have like judo crash pads. How hard would that be? You know, have that shit as a buffer in between the tables. Have everybody pushed back a little bit like fuck the fact that that can happen to a guy like hopkins has been fighting as long as he is scary, right? Yeah. He asked to be done now, man, because that was his doors damage he's ever taken. Yeah. He said he's done. He was thinking that he's never been stopped. That exchange was awful. Not just for the punches because he still takes a great fucking punch. He might've went down from the punches and got up and even survive the round. True, but landed on your head like that is no Bueno. Boom. That's scary to watch him. And he got a died there for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       Damn as twice I brought that up. So extreme punished. He couldn't stop being so extreme. But it's not that you guys care deeply about fighters. You'd love them. Well 51 year old fallen out of the ring on concrete on his head and he's like, God, he's on Mount Rushmore for boxing. I think you gotta give him credit for taking that fight because that guy, he's crazy. What the fuck? He thought he saw something in him that he might be able to exploit and he was wrong. How much money did he get for that fight? $7 72 like, like 5 million or something like that. I Dunno. Cause you want me to a million. 1 million. I wonder if he has a deal with HBO. Golden boy productions to right. And he's a part of golden boy. So he's a promoter and he got 1 million. It's worth though. He may falls. Not if you've guy like, but you made him a million to is a lot of money, you'll be fine.

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       But he already has millions. Yes. You know, Bernard is a wealthy guy still. Even if it doesn't matter if he has 10 million, if he made a million for that fight, him falling on his head like that, but not if he's never the same again Eddie, if your brain trauma or $1 million, that's like saying people would line up, say you've never done, never had any brain trauma. Huh? Um, I mean, so no you haven't. It leads to severe depression that sometimes people never get out of. There's all sorts of real huge issues with your hormonal system. Like you're essentially compromising the quality of your life forever. I play peewee or certain circumstances. Does that count 100% no, that was not Arizona with helmets, but I know people that have been Kao that were essentially never the same again, $800,000 he made one not that is, um, it was worth, it was worth it.

Speaker 6:          00:54:11       I wonder if that's the whole purse because that might be just like dad paid for the fights. A lot of money, dude, come on. It might have got a percentage of, you know the promotion because he's the guy. That's true. It's a Monterey. Even 2 million. A guy like Bernard Hopkins is not worth it. The problem is the way landed. It wasn't just the punches that he took because he's so skilled. He's good at like moving. Wish he was definitely going out. Okay. That left hook, his legs were going out. He got clipped, he got hit with hammers. He was going out using shots before that too. But if he went down in the middle of the ring, we might be thinking, you know, like maybe he could survive the round or maybe the referee is going to stop the fight. He definitely wouldn't have taken that.

Speaker 6:          00:54:48       The real issue was his whole body was limp when he fell. He just went right through stuff to watch. That's awful, man. Just put some netting in it, man. Make it so that can happen. You know? But you remember how the Old School Valley Tuto days used to have a net in the bottom rope. Yeah, it's pretty cool. That was pretty dope. Not, it doesn't have to be that ridiculous like that. Cause that was like the vans outside the ring. Like wwe, it seems like those ropes were a little loose too. We could fall out. Ropes were definitely loose. Yeah, that's not good. That's a huge issue. That might've been something that Bernard liked so he can move, you know like Bernard is really good at like moving away from Shit and if he's contained up against like a hard rope, he doesn't have that ability to drill in this stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:55:30       True. And you know like the best fighters who are really good at like utilizing the ropes would like lean back away from punches on the ropes. And again it's golden boy promotions. So I'm sure he had some say in that. That's good point. The kid is a killer. Well he also thought his last fight, he fought a cofa live, like he's taken on two killers in a row. Cova live. Did you really think you're going to beat that guy? I mean that's why we love Bernard Hopkins. But God, that's just shows you where a champion, that guy is that he took those two fight, that he decided to take the crusher and then this kid who is a relative unknown to most people, but super super. Who's got one? One? Yeah, he's super fucking name huge. He's huge. And he throws bombs. Well I don't get it though, cause it was a great job at Hbo.

Speaker 6:          00:56:18       Right? Doing commentating. He's 51 what else do you need to do? And Roy Jones is the same. Roy Jones a flight, a Turkey, fine on some weird like live streaming. Just get wax in the next week. I think Roy Jones owes a lot of money in taxes. I think that's what's going on. That's what I had read that he owed millions of dollars in taxes from when he was champ. Maybe he got bad financial advice. I don't know what the instances were, but uh, that's why he does it. Yeah, that's a bummer. I'm pretty sure that's what's going on. It's hard to balance because it's like, why are you fighting this random Russian and he's in Russia now. Like a lot. Like he's a Russian citizen. What? Yeah. Roy Jones Jr is a Russian citizen. He lives in Florida too though. Yeah. Might as well be Russia. They can have it. No, I'm kidding. My sister lives there. Let's just do that on site. Hurl families there. It's just weird yet I do is fight. Yeah. Um, Kovalev is, uh, he's fucking district. He's out of Florida too. He's been trained. He actually didn't he train up here for the last one? I think he did. I think he trained in Oxnard. Roy Jones Jr officially becomes Russian citizen with Moscow passport ceremony. Wow. And that crazy.

Speaker 6:          00:57:29       You know what man? He's probably just enjoying his life over there. Having a good time. True. It's just hard to see. Oh, you've got to accept who he is now and not think of who he is now versus who he used to be. Impossible. Yeah. That's what it really is. Because one of the things that like disturbed me, this guy sounds so fucked up, disturb me about his last knockout loss was how his body looked. I was looking at his body and I was like, this is, this is Roy Jones Jr. He looked like shit. He looked like he was not fit and it's not, it's not an age thing because Bernard looked really fit when he fought Joe Smith Jr Bernard look very fit. He didn't look like he did when he was 30 no, but he looked very fit and he looked in shape, you know, but like when we were looking at Chavez, Chavez never looked [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          00:58:14       He never looked like Melvin manhoef. You know Julio Cesar Chavez was like fairly smooth. It wasn't like this Jack Dude. Yeah, but it's still murder guys. So I feel like what we saw with Roy though was different thing. It's like this can't, he can't be working out like harsh, just shown up and talking to Murk. These guys such so skilled and it's been doing it for so long, he probably feels like he's got a certain amount of boxes. You see that knockout wasn't good. And another guy, he fought, he fought a fucking killer. He fought a straight up killer. See the UFC would never allow that. Like say like if [inaudible] wanted to come back. No Sir. Well done. Well that's one of the benefits of Dana being your friend. You know, like Dana does, doesn't want to have, he just does not want to be a part of that. And he's like, I care about him. I don't want him fighting again. And he's right. I don't think they'd let any of those old timers come back to him. Well that's the, you know, the problem is you can't tell someone what they can and can't do. Right. They're grown ass man. But you also have to realize at a certain point in time, like fight that that ego that a fighter has and it's hard to say who's who's right

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       and who's wrong because like they said that about Bernard Hopkins when he fought Kelly Pavlik with fuck Kelly Pavlik they said he was done. That was such the exception, just such the exemption by alien. But because he was that exception, we got to watch some crazy fights. But think of now, but think about the other exceptions that it never worked out. Well, the difference is also Bernard had never been knocked out before. True. And he's a really skillful, technically like really difficult to hit, but it also would diminish the, your product, like the UFC would never have like coleman come back or Don Frye, I think of Joe Montana came back to shall pass. What about that? That was like that spice huge. Yeah, that was huge. But you know that fight was, it's a man. It's like at a certain, you don't want to see a certain amount of deterioration from your champs.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       I don't want to see Jerry Rice catching passes right now. There's fucking bad knees. All dudes fight. Oh Dude, why not let them fire all? We're so worried about their distance. They want to fight. Let them fight. You remember when Ray Mercer fought Larry Holmes? Bitch, your ass boxes face off like God damn lie homes was like 46 or some shit. Then we're not going to let you find out how old Larry Holmes was when he fought ray mercer. And this is after Mike Tyson and marked them. So Mike Tyson burped him and then Mike Tyson went to jail and then he was like, as long as that mother fuckers in jail, I'm boxing.

Speaker 2:          01:00:46       Fuck. What's that? He was honest. He fuck the Kings in jail. They case the line. Yeah, I'm coming out. Well it was all here. Everyone had when they fought Mike Tyson in those early days I would have loved to have seen Larry Holmes in his prime fight. Mike Tyson. Now we've got marlene, Psalm 42 oh that's not that bad. That's it. That's a different 42 though. That's not like a 42 in 2016 that's in 1992 42 zero new Mexican supplements. So totally different. Yeah, that's totally different deal set. A 42 year olds. Heck crazy. We don't even think about, cause I homes gotta be in his late sixties or some shit. Well I think he retired when he was like 51 or something like that. I think he had like a fight like in his fifties but uh, Larry Holmes in his prime, like the Larry Holmes, it fucked up Muhammad Ali. He would give anyone a run for their money here.

Speaker 2:          01:01:43       He helped big day where that was the end of Muhammad Ali. 100%. You're definitely right. I still, when you talk about like a vintage or you talked about fucking George Foreman, those guys are so big man. But you look at like Larry's body here. This is not the same body that he had. Like when he fought Ali, he was doughy or, and he had like a little bit of a, well actually it doesn't look bad right here, man doesn't look bad right here. This looks like the Larry Holmes that fought Mike Tyson, which was like hangs down. Ooh, you look good man. One, two, but little slower than he was when he was young. Ray Mercer was always a fucking murderer though, man. He was scary dude. Ray Mercer

Speaker 6:          01:02:21       started late in his career, wasn't he a military guy? He started in thirties, Olympic gold medalist and boxing and uh, we did it from the army. He's a bad motherfucker dude. And he hit hard. But Larry Holmes, once the Fight War on got that Jab, whenever I think back to these fights, those, I always think those guys hit so much harder than guys now. Well, um, they were knockout artists and, and knock out artist like ray mercer. He could be a knockout RC in any generation, but Larry Holmes, he would give fucking anybody today a run for their money. Anybody? Anthony, Joshua, he would fuck up a lot of these guys. Ben Klitschko, Larry Holmes, like go to Larry Holmes, a beat Muhammad Ali because you're, you're here. You're watching Larry Holmes. It's like 42 years old in 1992, which is like 80 today. 85 no trt and no vitamins. No, didn't know nothing about Kido Watch.

Speaker 6:          01:03:17       Go full screen and then just go to like the middle of the fight, man. Dude, I went with ordinary home for the holidays. So the cow, good. Larry Holmes. Look back here, man. I'll look at his movement. Yeah, way, way leaner, way faster. And look at his head movement. Nasty Fucking Jab. That's a different Muhammad Ali though. Yeah, it is different. Muhammad Ali and it's a different Larry Holmes till this is Larry Holmes who was a punisher like look at he's, he's angry with that chat was like, it makes a mean face when he's popping them with it. Larry Holmes was a bad motherfucker dude. And he fought smart too. I mean he respected Ali and just what systematically beat him down and it was hard to watch because Ali was way past his prime way past his punch. A bummer man. It was a huge bummer to watch because we were absolutely sure that Ali was getting fucked up.

Speaker 6:          01:04:03       There was no going on. Yeah. There was no denying it towards, you know, the remaining rounds of the fight. I forget how long it went, you know, the best body and box and vault time. You ready for this evander holyfield. Oh yeah. It's a good argument. Jacked. Yeah, he's about as Jack did you get tough. Fuck. He was one of the first guys to like legitimately put on muscle and move up to the heavyweight division to remember when he was a cruiserweight champion. Remember when he fought dwight cow? We do commander Holyfield at cruiserweight fought Dwight Mohammed cow who was five seven the Camden buzzsaw off five 795 pounds. It's bus saw. What a great, yeah dude, he did. That dude was an animal. He was built so weird and he went up to heavyweight after that. Any fucked a lot of guys at five seven Dwight Kawi. I'm pretty sure he's five seven. I'm not, I'm, I don't, I don't believe I'm exaggerating that. I think he was literally an inch shorter than me and he was fighting as a light motherfucking heavyweight and a heavyweight and cruise cruiserweight is really where it started. One 95 but he was at tank. He's was like this fucking jacked up looking who some are Paul Harris looking dude look like God job. Yeah, but, but I, I, you know, I don't know if it was supplements back then, I think five, six years,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       five six that was wrong. That is a short one. 90 but wa watch him fight, man. It was just so weird because he was a dangerous big powerful guy. Look at Vendor Holyfield Ben, that's the lien of Ander. Holyfield coming out of the Olympics. Hunt yelling at him. Yeah, it's a different evander. This was skinny young evander, but look at coffee man. Just just this tank of a dude short and throws these looping over hand shots and you're always punching down on and look at the size difference man and just hard as nails. A hard as nails. Dude, don't ball. Just like fucking give a fuck. He's like, I'm not here to Slang Dick. I'm going to sling some leather. Look at his socks, the lesson, 1990 sweat socks. They were killing it back then. Cow. We had a totally different approach because he was so short for that division.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       When you watched him fight, it was like confusing. It's like, I ain't never seen this before. Like holy field was be like two feet taller than him at points because cow. We also fought crouched, so he had moved in tight guard crouched Tyson style. No, he had his own thing. Mad. A lot of bobbing and weaving. He didn't have the same sort of combination, ruthless punching style that Tyson did. Tyson could just fuck you up with one shot and he knew it. [inaudible] was like a Mauler. He would maul you like that right there. But he's fighting guys way bigger than him. You know Tyson was probably like five 11 right? Wasn't it? Somewhere on there. I thought. Still Short. Still Short. Still Short, but a different, oh, holyfield connected and drops him. Holyfield I mean, that's what I'm saying. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Remember his fight with Burke Cooper?

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       Another one? No, I don't. Oh my goodness. I really os burt cooper like on the verge of superstardom and him and Holyfield Godo Wiz are with our son Evander Holyfield. I mean just, he was awesome. Past go to holyfield versus Burt Cooper dropping some boxing knowledge on you motherfuckers done. I should know about mma. Yeah, I was huge. Eddie Bravo and I both, man, we were huge boxing fans. While you're still, he's still, I love it. I can't get [inaudible]. We stopped him, look at that and he stopped him. Been talking about boxing for an hour. Poli field, man in his prime, Dan, I dropped. That was the second time they fought Jamie. That's the second time. That was when Kylie was older. See if you can find the first one. The first one was the revenge fight because in the first fight they went to war and a cow. We and Evander Holyfield went to war, but cow, we wound up losing the decision and it was like a big fight for a vendor.

Speaker 2:          01:08:00       So that was the second one. What is this? I thought I clicked too quick. It's Tim Fighting George Foreman. George Foreman versus cow. We how ridiculous is that? So George Foreman, fod. Kali. Kali was five six. George Foreman's fucking hands were a foot wide. That's ridiculous. No thought he fought at 50 didn't me. Oh yeah, you won the title at 46 you know what to say? Former hardest hitter of all time. I believe it. Remember that Michael's prime, that you're forming fire. Look at it. So this is the first Gulf war with one punch. This was when Kylie was younger and this was a really close fight. This is the different fight. The second fight of was just on a totally different level and [inaudible] was older, but [inaudible] he used to, whereas his waist, his pants rather as his belt, way the fuck up high. The straps of his shorts were like way above his belly button.

Speaker 2:          01:08:51       He looks like the blue guy or the green debt from Monsters Inc. Yeah, this is just the whole body then. There's not a lot to hit now and this little fire hydrant, but this is like holy fields first big test. But see if you can go to, uh, that other fight that we're talking about. Lean holyfield his man there. He's so skinny. What was the other five? Burke Cooper go holyfield burke coover holyfield burke hoover was crazy war and this is like 1991, I think. And Burke Cooper was a bad mother fucker smoking burt that go go deep into the fight here. Young Jamie. What kind of, Oh, okay. Eventually Kill Them. More rocked up here. Son Per Cooper was a savage man. He knocked motherfuckers out too. He's a vicious power puncher and this was like a sort of a make or break fight for him because a lot of people thought that burke crew like Burke Cooper could fuck it crack.

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       And a lot of people thought that Burke Cooper had a shot at being like one of the top guys and this, this was the fight that separated these two guys. Just an awesome fight, man. GRC, some Jessia vantage crib in Atlanta. It's not really a house. It's more like a, I would tell her your campus like a college straight up fucking giant university from the dus suggest like USC or some shit in Atlanta. Yeah, like a hundred room mantra. When are you just doing balls? He went balls out. That's how, um, uh, um, Ron White described Larry the cable guy's place. That's who it was. He said, Larry, the cable guy's house looks like a university. Really? And he's like not Phoenix University.

Speaker 2:          01:10:28       Did I say oh was the case? I'm sure that's where I came from guys too though. Yeah, I'm sure both of those guys live in fucking giant mansions. Larry the cable guy's a funny dude, man, is he? Yeah, he's a nice guy too, man. I used to hang with that guy in the Montreal comedy festival before anybody knew who he was and he was funny back there. He's a good dude, man. He was doing that. Larry the cable guy thing on a radio show in Florida. It was like a character that he did and then cause he'd have his regular stamp and then that was just a bit that you do it late I think. I'm not exactly sure the origins of it, but I think he started out doing radio and then from radio he started taking it to the stage, but his real name, this visit videos of him as Dan Whitney doing standup. Damn. Yeah. I didn't realize how big it was. I think I wasn't making fun of him and I was like, cause that guy is still alive. I think we're on this showing

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       you like what? Boom, Nebraska sold out fucking arenas, arenas and shit. Josh Wolfe took a picture of himself opening up for Larry, the cable guy in a football arena that was sold out. God, God in the south, dude, shut your mouth shut. Shut your mouth. Mouth. You got think man Nascar and fucking redneck joke. This is what you've got to think. There are 300 in who knows how many millions in this country and you go down South Larry, the cable guy can get millions of people to see him. He might be able to do a million person show. How the fuck, not sky's the limit. If you had a million seat arena, he's selling it. And Larry, the cable guy might sell out a fucking million seat arena. And that's not a bullshit. That's not bullshit. What is that about? Can you explain that? It's a funny dude, but he also represents them.

Speaker 6:          01:12:04       He's like a very good joke writer. He's south. Well it's, he also represents them like he's doing like redneck sort of Shayne's third democrats. This is the voice and it's really well written. It's funny shit. You know, he's, and he's a good dude. He's a genuinely good dude. And, and him and Jeff, Jeff Fox, Jeff foxworthy. It was like the captain of that ship. Yeah. And then those other guys and Ron White and he brought ron white in apparently. Um, and Ron White was, you know, doing well. I mean, everybody knew who he was. I knew who he was. Everybody knew like he was a, a well respected headliners clubs, but people didn't really know how fucking funny he was until Jeff Foxworthy put them in front of everybody. He's a great guy to then corrections. They're super dirty. Southern Guy. Ron White's pretty dirty. Ron White has this whole bit about, um, how when he was in the navy stationed in Hawaii, he kept, he was getting his dick sucked by hookers and you'd know they were girls.

Speaker 6:          01:13:00       They were boys. He thought that there were girls the whole time until like years later, he was watching some show about during the 1970s when he was there, all these transvestite hookers that were operating in this one block that he used to go like every day to get my dentist. He's like, I got my dick sucked by about 150. Dude, he's talking about it last week on the podcast. If you haven't heard the Ron White podcasts, listen to that shit. He's a genius. He's a brilliant story teller. He's from stand up, stand up and he's such a good dude. So He's, he's uh, um, the blue country guy. Yeah, he's a dirty country guy for sure, but there's college. Those guys, you know what man, it's just I think um, with when it comes to like what we think of as country, like we think of as the south, you know, I think people who live in cities are very prejudiced of it. I don't think it's the same thing today as it was 20 years ago. Everybody knows things now, man. Everybody understands things way better now than they ever did before. Like if you lived in like a West Virginia in the 1970s, you probably, if you lived in a real rural coal mining community or something like that, like, man, good luck getting any sort of access

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       to any information other than what's right in front of you in your town. But now, now you've got a phone and everybody cell tells you something. You can just check your phone and go, well that's not really true. You know, I just googled it and Stephen Hawkins says that this, Ooh and you will these kids, they can be way more informed today than they were back then. So I think when people think of the rural south as being like that, I think that was a part of a problem with this last election. I think a lot of people thought like that. There's certain people that live in certain places that are just stupid, you know, the, the, the red states and then the, these people are ignorant who'd say, and they proved it with the election. Like the problem with even saying that is people don't like when certain people talk shit about them, they don't like it.

Speaker 4:          01:14:59       Right. It makes them feel bad. If you make fun of people live in West Virginia, like I just did people in West Virginia to get pissed off right there. It's not the state, not the same people anymore. Like our ideas of these like spots of the country where they don't have information. We've got to let go of that idea. Like there's depth there. Definitely like leaning more right in some places than left. And that makes sense. But there's still a ton of fucking people that get it in these places that didn't exist just 20 years ago. Well yeah cause it, especially to your point, because the smartphones, like everyone thinks, I'm like, Oh hey, like what's going on out there? But they're fucking, it's easy. Like you said, don't even bring up Google or whatever, any news. Like my dad and I, my dad's in town, we know argument and he's up against some point and I was like, oh cool. Just went on my phone was like, nope, wrong. And end up discussion. So I don't know what you want to do.

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       Well people just have these ideas in their head and they've had them for a long time. And uh, you know, if you live in a rural community and you don't have the internet, you could just stick with those ideas and those ideas will be transferred onto your kids and transfer it onto their kids. And it's, you're fucked. You're fucked. If you live in a tough spot like that, if you live in a bad place filled with dumb people and there's no new stuff coming in, you got to get the fuck out and you don't even know how you're going to get out. Or if you're, if you just don't have access like North Korea and they just have no fucking clue what's cause. See what they were making them do for North Korea with Kim Jong rooms making them do on Christmas. No, he makes people worship the mother of the revolution.

Speaker 4:          01:16:31       The his grandmother who was the wife of the first dictator of North Korea who she died of mysterious causes and like 1949 and so like he is so anti Christmas. This guy, he literally is like, he's like a character and a Dr Seuss wavy ticky so anti Christmas, she's like the grinch. So they have to celebrate his dead. They have to celebrate his grandmother, the mother of the revolution, the fullest. Crazy. You estimate 18 Korean cities disappear during that war. Look at that and that's why he, I mean 18 cities disappeared. What do you mean the war

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       on the Korean war between bombed 18 cities in the North Korea? Yes. And then the hole, that's when the regime started. Well, the Korean War, um, when did that end? Uh, fifties in the 50s. Some June does a weird war, right? Like people don't really talk about that one too. We're talking about the, but they did, it was, I was watching a documentary about, uh, how doctors, uh, they're allowed to go into, um, everyone's Korean and fix people's eyes. They give them like a month and these doctors from China, they come in and they do the cataract surgery and his assistant snuck in. She was a journalist. She posed as an assistant just to get in, just to get some footage of on the inside. So it was about, you know, it is fucking weird. And North Korea, it's weird as fuck. And that guy is crazy as fuck. But at the top of that documentary, that was not pro North Korea, it was, it was anti North Korea.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       But at the very top of it, when she's breaking down with the documentaries about it, she, she, she mentioned how 18 cities evaporated in the war. It's war son. Exactly. No wonder there's so much hate for the fucking dus. What their issue is, their issue was their dictator is ruthless and is dominating them with fear. He bases it on that, but that doesn't make any sense. He's doing it against his own people. What he's doing is imprisoning his entire country. I agree with that bombing 18 cities. It's fucking disgusting. But think about that. So just as bad, like it's almost like you could understand it was an abused child. You know what I mean? 18 sit q man's, but he's fucking country out there. If there was a country out there that firebombed 18 of our major cities, why would we feel about that country?

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       You would be, you'd be fucking lynched if you said anything pro that country. It would be that kind of church. I go to bed. You Bet. That's like Holocaust type shit. You bring up that shit. You'd be fucking bed. You'd just keep that shit to yourself. Well, that's what you ever talked to someone who has, who's Armenian, who's spoken to an Armenian genocide denier. There's a lot of like that Armenian genocide is a very rarely discussed holocaust. I mean not, not the Holocaust, but you know, in terms of the use the word to describe an atrocity, it was a terrible thing. And there's deniers of that. And when you find an Armenian and you talked to him about people that deny the Armenian genocide, I remember manny, I'm gim Berean. He won a fight and I was interviewing them after the fight and he was dedicating to fight the fight to the Armenian genocide to the victim. So the Armenian genocide. Okay. And I remember thinking, wow, like when was the last time you even heard about that? Nobody ever talks about that. Never, never. It never gets discussed. I think Shirley and people died and I'm pretty sure it, La has the biggest, um, Armenian population population that it, right? Pretty sure. Hell yeah. You go to Glendale. Wow.

Speaker 6:          01:20:09       Okay. The United States drop 635 tons of bombs in Korea, not counting 32,557 tons of napalm compared to 503 tons in the entire Pacific theater in World War II. At least 50% of 18 out of the north, 22 major cities were obliterated. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. Right? Was that right? Yeah, you're 100% right. I mean this is the Internet. Are we in the library? Did you get that from library.com? Um, that is terrifying. Look at the images up there. Napalm bomb that you kind of look at that in Joan will or whenever the book, his name is as crazy as fuck for sure. But he caught you kind of understand when someone's really crazy and they've been abused and tortured as a child. You, you kind of like, I understand what you're saying, but um, I can't, I guess the argument would be that if they didn't do it, what was the war over? The war was over communism. Right? So the what happened at the end of the war, was it the two different countries? They became North End, South Korea. How's that? I don't know the details of when was, I know it's probably fucked up the out when will North Korea was a founded because this was, this is like the takeover.

Speaker 6:          01:21:29       18 different cities destroyed out of him. I knew he does. They say 20 to 22. When was uh, uh, South Korea and one was North Korea formed. And when, when did it become like north and South Korea? Do you know? In the 50 sometimes. So before that it was just all Korea. I'm not sure. I don't know that much about why do I not know this? All I know is we fire bombed 18 other cities. Man. That's devastating shit. Yeah. We talk about all these different, uh, well I think again, back then, man,

Speaker 6:          01:22:03       you, you never look in North Korea has a history. 1945. Oh, the partition of Korea at the end of World War II. Interesting. The creation of the communist aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Okay. Kim Il Song in 1950 the Korean War broke out so they broke off in 1945 and water to be Communist. Five years later we were going to war with them. Man. I don't know the history of it. I'd be talking shit if I said I, I had an opinion on it, but it sounds pretty sure I'm pretty, I'm guessing that we, we shouldn't have been up in there fucking mass. That's less. We were worried that he was going to become another Hitler and that it was going to become a just a further extension of World War II. It was going to move on Maria, history of world war two that is like we don't really know the history of World War Two.

Speaker 6:          01:22:56       There's that mainstream history and then there's the real shit. Well, you know, world war one to both of them are just like world war one is very bizarre man. When you go back and listen to Dan Carlin talk about World War One and you realize how recent that was, where most of these guys were walking everywhere, walking everywhere with guns, you're like, what? Like, yeah, that's what they did. They walked, they walked with guns there, walked across countries, braveheart with guns. It is ridiculous when you realize like that was a hundred years ago. You go holy Shit. Like what has happened and now instead of just, you know, 50 years after that, less less than 50 years after that there napalming entire cities wiping out whole cities like the, the ability that where it used to be at like cannons and shit, the Ed to move and push him closer and closer to people.

Speaker 6:          01:23:45       The difference between that and being able to drop shit out planes on people's heads, drones now, not even crazy guys. They got a con just she took continental ballistic missiles, missiles that are pointed at Russia and Russia's got him pointed at us and we just go, yeah, yeah. That's where like the fucking Hatfield's and the Mccoy's just stand at the barrel of Martin, Sam Moore and Ralph Lauren. Ralph sheep dog and the Coyote. Yeah, old school reference morning Ralph Lauren, Ralph, they would punch in and they beat the fuck the sheepdog. Beat the fuck out of the coyote all day long. At the end they would punch out and leave through that reus around there. What was the, a rooster is racist as fuck if you're not bro, come here, boy. Fuck corn. Corn was racist. What's your racist? Yeah, if you listen to how I say it, I said come here boy.

Speaker 6:          01:24:33       And he kept doing that, but he was talking to chickens. Now he would say some racist shit. He was talking to chickens though, Bro. That, but the way he wasn't even talking to people. Racist. Racist doesn't count with animals. It doesn't. We're all racist. We prefer squirrels over rats. You see a rather nice rat. You see a squirrel. You don't mind your kid playing on the grass was grown on a tree near it. I see. I like her at, yeah, but if you saw a squirrel, all right. If your kid was in the, in the grass, having a good time playing around with a ball and then like a hundred yards away, there was a tree with a squirrel kind of school. Fuck. Any kind of squirrel. The big bushy tail. Cute little fellow. Got a nut. Yeah, there's no problems. There's no problems. Right? If he was like 50 feet from Uk, would you freak out?

Speaker 6:          01:25:16       And I wouldn't be comfortable it and went to anything. He wouldn't care nothing to babies. But that was a rat. 50 feet from your kid, you'd freak the fuck out, right? Yeah. Well cause rats are sisters because you're raised with that rat was clean. What if that route was trying to better the rack community? Would that, what does that rat was a leader with their rat was the one rat trying to elevate the other rats. They need to be eating garbage and cannibalize each other to be better. We need to build homes. We need to establish communities. We need to teach people about rat traps. I like, I like rats. What am I supposed to survive on? On rats and roaches. But if we did that would fuck the, the economy up when you all these assholes that want to kill coyotes. Man, if there wasn't for coyotes, we'd have roaches or rats. Least everywhere.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       Rats. Rats. Fuck. Yeah, they do. That's like the main diet. Their main dies like rats and rabbits. Chili's, a bunch of coyotes to New York. Man, they're already there. Coyotes. Coyotes aren't like the city though. The cities are in the city. Dude, coyotes are in every city in the country. I just got done reading this book on him. Coyote America. Jamie wrote a whole book on Cody's crazy book, man by a guest that's coming on soon. Coyote turned up in middle village, Queens and April 27 there's generally seen as a freak. It's inch in it, but it wasn't even the first sighting of 2015 there's many coyotes that live in mass in um, uh, central park. There's Kylie's it live in Queens. Yeah. They live all over Manhattan. Well, they're going where the food's at, right? They go everywhere. They're all over the country. There are small wolf that lives in every single city, every single state, all over the country and do we kit, we really don't kill him.

Speaker 4:          01:26:58       We can't have tried to kill him. They did. The biggest mass effort to eradicate a species ever was on coyotes and wolves. First Forrest Wolves, which was successful. And then coyotes. Not only does it not work, it has the opposite effect. When you hear coyote screaming, they're, they're doing, we'll call. They're just like, who's here? Who's here? Oh No. Yeah, they're trying to find out who's in attendance right after the attendance calls over if ones missing or two's missing up. So they think someone's dead or gone. The female has more babies. So the female will go from having four puppies to having 10 or 15 and then they also stretched the range out there. Different than wolves in that wolves have to operate in packs. Coyotes can operate as a singular or impacts. Now, what was a, okay roll call and then, oh, someone was really attendance.

Speaker 4:          01:27:45       And then what happens? The Mama starts making more babies. They're missing. So if someone's missing, say if they have a pack, the pack is like eight coyotes, but one coyote gets jacked by a mountain lion. They yell out. And when they find out that that kid is missing, the females say we need to make more babies and it's like to keep their species alive, they produce more offspring. So they'll go from having, so they have sex ups? No, no, no. Their pups or larger groups. So from four pups to having like 10 to 13 it's like the body produces more babies. Yeah. So the smarter than the wolves. Oh yeah dude, they're just smaller. Did there, they're fucking ridiculously smart. They're, they're sneaky and they're smart enough to know to not attack humans. Yeah. We'd leave them alone if we don't attack them. You don't, you don't hear a lot of coyote attacks on dogs and shit around.

Speaker 4:          01:28:34       It's cause they don't attack. They just happen. Not Be, be scared if they weren't as good as humans at attack, that'd be gone. This professor that, uh, I've got coming on the floor, the podcast, Dan Flores, who wrote that book, Coyote America, what he said is that coyotes when like the, the like a couple of hundred years ago, like they were only in the west coast and as people push them away, they started establishing new territories like us making cities and going after them, made them spread out across the whole country. She's us like an, it's, there's people that don't understand this. Like he got approached by this one because people know he's a coyote expert. You got approached by these people that were doing this coyote a rescue mission. Like we're here to save the coyotes, the coyotes doing great. Like you're here to save it, save it from what they're everywhere.

Speaker 4:          01:29:24       Like they literally have populated quietly and sneakily the entire country and the efforts, all efforts to eradicate them failed when they let me have it. See when they have male wolves, they can cyanide like a horse. They take a horse and they'll shoot a male wolf and then they take his balls and his dick and they rub is sent in his glands all over this, this animal so that the other wolves recognize that he's been there. So they think it's safe to eat. So they start eating this horse that's been cyanide and then they would all die and so they would pop. They would, they would attack these packs of wolves that way they would shoot the mail, they would take his sand, put on this meat, take a horse, shoot the horse, injecting with cyanide immediately. So it went through his entire nervous system where it's not just our circulation system. And so all the meat would be poisoned. And they did that. And they eradicated walls throughout the entire west coast until they brought him back into yellowstone in the 1990s there were like virtually

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       actually gone. But yes. Animal too. I was reading the article that they're, they're thinking about building a bridge over the four oh five and I didn't know this. There's fucking mountain lines. Oh, you can't depend, you can't it. But someone hit one in a car because they're trying to crossover, trying to cross the four oh five well that problem. And they want to build a little ramp during almost a land. Um, they're in like a land island, like around the Malibu area. Yeah. That's what they're trying to do. Just to keep the big monsters live. Yeah. One of them killed 11 alpacas in a goat in Malibu. Just a couple of weeks ago, they put a depredation order on it. They were going to kill it, but this lady who owned the farm got so much hate mail after they said they were going to kill the mountain line, that she changed her mind.

Speaker 2:          01:31:04       She didn't want to kill it because mental mind doing mountain land shit cause she has a farm up there. That's her living. It's making these Alpacas and this thing jacked 11 which you sign up for a lady in a way. Right. But if it's killing your food and killing your, your you're living. That's why you make a living is by selling. Alpacas are doing, I don't know what the fuck is an Alpaca. It's like what the fuck's hustle hustling llamas when Alan can do with them, rent them to rich kids' birthday parties. The fuck do you do with a Lama in Malibu Llamas just sweating their asses off. There was a dude who own the common connection that had llamas, had llamas living in his yard. Alpaca is a speech they spit to. They split like a motherfucker. Yeah, it's a species of South American Kamlish. It's a camel. It resembles a small Lama in appearance. There are two breeds of Alpaca. Wow. So anyway, this lion in one day, Jack, Jack 11 of these things and just left him there and

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       they're big. Oh, didn't eat it. Just kill. He just had a good old time killing them.

Speaker 3:          01:32:04       Yeah. You got to get rid of that one. Yeah. Is there a problem with wolves and hunters hunters or did they,

Speaker 6:          01:32:10       they certainly would. I had a friend who was cornered by wolves. They tried to take his elk and he wound up, they went up killing I think two or three wolves. I think they killed three, three wolves. I would have told us the story again. He had one friend with a rifle and him with a bow. He killed two of them with a bow and the guy with them killed one of them with a rifle and they were surrounding them and they were trying to get the elk away from him. They had shot him. They fucked up. They didn't know that. They were like in the wolves' Den. It was like that fucking the gray movie. Like they shot this elk like right near the wolves' den and the wolves like, yeah, we'll take that dude. Natural Shit. Yeah. And they surrounded these dudes and uh, started rushing them.

Speaker 6:          01:32:47       Like really? It's a crazy car. Three storing. And then the other ones took off. They were like, fuck this. The gun I think probably scare them. They're like, oh this, these mother fuckers have guns. And they did their call. They did their attendance called, and they were surrounding them, but they were, the wolves must've realized, Oh shit, they killed two of us. I think there's two that are gone. And then the killed a third and then like that's it now. He said he was, he had the Alpha male in his sight and he had his bow drawn back and the wolf took off running. And when the wolf took off running, the rest of the pack went to, they were like, fuck this. They're lucky they had a gun and not just those bones. So the patch. So lucky. Not only that lucky, it's not just one dude with a bow and arrow. Like if you didn't have that guy with a fun with them

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       would have been fucked. You know what's strange is killer whales have no problem killing other dolphins and other whales. They go after and hunt them. How come they don't go after humans like that? Oh, they have have they only videos but only in seaworld? Forget about seaworld. No, he had on my regular one ocean when the wild, I've never heard of that. I grabbed a lady and she said, see Ya Zinc. No, no, no, no shaming it have a story that happened in seaworld. No, no. I'm positive. This is in the ocean. He grabbed the lady or the guy by the leg and just fucking kills off. Kills Him. Takes off. But one of the, how often know how many reports are there of killer whales attacking humans? I mean is there do this almost none. They go after dolphins and other way it was like getting shit. They have fun. Great whites too. Yeah, they have no fun. They have fun with it. They go after they're mammals. So why wouldn't the, oh no, humans are they that smart to know offense to man, they like coyotes. Are they like how it is like, you know what? If we fuck with humans, they're going to come after us do. Are they smart enough to know not to fuck with us or are they being, is it like a spiritual thing? What is it? There's a bogus story

Speaker 6:          01:34:32       that I read online that I repeated on the podcast for. I looked it up, but the book, the book is that I'm pretty sure Adam Carolla told me or some of them I don't, I don't remember where I got it from, but the bogus story was that before, I don't think Adam Kroll believes this, by the way, before World War Two they used to attack us, but then once a, they used to do target practice with them from planes. Killer whale stopped us. Turned out

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       to not be a true story at all. But that's what a killer story. What a great story it'd be if it was true. It sounds like some place you used to fuck with us and they're like, oh, check this out. And they're like, yeah, we'll help you guys fall in the water. Pull you out. Just please stop. Stop that. Yeah, we could work together. Yeah. Killer whales are gnarly, man. What's up with that? The gnarliest or maybe if you found out you see that there's a big cover. I've seen it kill humans all the time. I think it's a guy in a, in a, in a pond. In the tank. The exception, like obviously seal hunt people, but grab this fucking lady by the ankle was like, ew, I don't know about that man. I never heard that. I'd like to see. Just see that at the library.

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       What do you get your news? Where do you get your hands, Bro? Hey Bro. Kellen sent me that. Is there a youtube video about it? Yes or no? Yeah. Killer. I found one fake one. I see one from seaworld. There's one where uh, a Japanese whaling crew was eaten alive by killer whales. Thanks. Cake. That's not a video. It just says like a story. What was the story? Japanese crew was eaten alive by killer whales. That's one of those fucking fake news stories. You hear that fake news thing about up Pakistan was like there literally were like ready to go to war with, uh, what was the, I tweeted earlier today, someone believes some fake news story. I'm not believing this store. There's other news things on there like, so it's a fake news story about fake news jacking off for it. But no, no, no. That was nail from the same site.

Speaker 2:          01:36:31       Now this is not from Sam, but the one that I tweeted earlier today, I saw that that was a fake news story. I'll pull that up. Right, right. That was about, but it was on cnn about a fake news story. Right. And then they bought into it or about, someone bought into it with this story about the war of the potential for war wasn't fake, wasn't gonna stay administer issues just popped up. I put it up there warning. It's real after being tricked by fake news. Right. But that's what I was talking about. Yeah. So that's real, right? That's not fake news. The ultimate trolling. That's that dude. When they're talking about fake news site, that's the fake shit. This shit. Okay, well either way. Either way. Whoever, whoever wrote fake news that they put what? First of all, shitty being tricked by fake news site.

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       They keep putting that out there cause they're gonna censor real shit and it's going to be government state run. They're going China style did they already doing? I'm trying to scroll up for a second. You anything you want in China? No doubt. And I'm sorry down. You got to train. Anybody go to China. But guess what? You can't watch regular youtube. Why don't they have a space between Pakistans and defense minister? This is fucking CNN. How about you put a goddamn space in between your words is the Shitty Lazy Editors, early men. What does it Jamie? This is the telegraph.co. Dot. UK. Oh, okay. This one is, so what's the CNN one? There was a cnn one that I tweeted. This was not exactly what a tween, but either way it's the whole thing is very bizarre. Homeboy got

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       trolled and was about to sit down. It's like a war. We'll take you to war. Bitch is right here. Yeah. There's a CNN article duped by fake news story. Pakistani mini administer threatens nuclear war with Israel. What they're trying to do is put out, uh, at scare people with fake news sites so that they could go in there and have a reason, a sensor and everyone's going to go, yeah, fuck thick new sites. Let's fucking sensor. Okay, you don't get emotional. Let's just communicate. Anytime we see something like that in quotes that go fake new sec, tricked by fake news, people are going to go, yes, it's fake on facebook and see that chip. It's honey dick. Why Honey Dick in your face? Right? But here's the thing. Well, who's making these fake news sites and it wouldn't it be in the best interest of the government to make fake news sites of their own? So they all have a reason to not have fake news sites around.

Speaker 3:          01:38:50       But do you think they could literally stop people from putting stuff out on the Internet? I mean, if that's the ultimate goal, now what they're doing is they're going to censor the top, uh, alternative media, new sites that going after them. That's the target. This is a big trick saying like CNN, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like breitbart or, yeah, like drudge, infowars wars. They're putting out the real shit, but they got control the media. So they're saying, oh, that's fake news. So that creating a fake news problem that isn't there so that that can go in and sensor the real shit. It's a fucking trick. If you see it on CNN, I called it every headline being tricked by fake news. They're getting everyone going. Yeah. Thick, new sucks. Fuck that. You know? Then they're going, yeah, it does. Right? Look, here's another fake news site, and people are being tricked and doing all this crazy shit and walking into pizza places with fucking machine guns.

Speaker 3:          01:39:40       They yell it, Stop Fake News. What are we gonna to do? Let's just sign it. Boom. They're going to, they're going China style. They're gonna. They're going to censor. The Internet isn't going to work. They're going to blacklist you. If you're a new site that's credible and you're fucking with the agenda, boom, they're going to go, hey, that's fake, dude, you're off. That's what there were in the middle of that. Right now we're being assaulted with people being tricked by fake news. When have you been tricked by fucking fake and offices? They're not tricking me. You settle down. Anybody can be tricked by fake news for sure. They can be and if the the, the question is who's actually doing it? Is the government doing it so they can crack down on alternative controls saying like Wiki leaks or anybody that's putting out stuff that doesn't agree with her agenda or is there a real issue?

Speaker 3:          01:40:26       There's a real issue and that, that's what I say. I say I say there's bulk. Correct. I say the government for sure would benefit from there being less sources of news and more that they can control and being able to put the wraps on someone like Edward Snowden and not allow that to happen. For sure. They would definitely benefit from that, but there's also a bunch of people writing some fake articles and they'd do it for profit. They do it for clicks is there was one shut up. He was, yes. He interviewed him and he was doing some don't. Wow Eddie, please just be BHP

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       rational. We've talking about stuff. We're not disagreeing with you. They'll say you. We're saying it's all the above. Like I'm saying that people get paid to write fake news. I'm saying they get money from ad clicks. They can make 10 $13,000 a month. They interviewed this dude who did it and he started getting out of control with it. He did it to troll Republican people and then you realize how much ad sends he can make from doing that and he's making a fucking sizeable chunk of money, so there's those guys, but then there's also for sure there would be government agencies that would almost be, it would be their responsibility to control information. Like if you wanted to control information, one of the best ways to do it would be put out disinformation cloud. The story that's subterfuge. That's been going on in the CIA and the NSA and this been going on and all of these like secretive intelligence community groups, they do that forever.

Speaker 4:          01:41:45       They like if you, if you pay attention to what we absolutely know about how they engage with the enemy, they use every tactic. They don't not use deception. They don't not use propaganda. The the 450 million plus they spent on those fake terrorist videos to know it, but they also had in their mind a legitimate reason for doing it. That's what they say. Because you're right, you're right. It could be, but Eddie, but it could be both. See their, their legitimate reason is they have a real player. This is how you watch those videos or it's in a real player. When you click into a real player, it, it checks your Ip. It knows your Ip, so could figure out where you're coming from so they can pocket. If they could target pockets of people in certain terrorist rich parts of the world where they knew that there was a bunch of uh, isis people or what have you.

Speaker 4:          01:42:30       If they put out some recruitment video and they can find that there's a lot of people that are watching it in certain areas, they can sort of in their mind triangulate where these terrorists could be loved. Idea. It's the same I was reading Howard. It's both end. It's both. It, that's the cover story, right? But that, but it is bold. Isis does exist. There are bad people in the world. There are terrorist in the world. Kim John Owen is a real guy. He is. He is a dictator over his entire country. There's a bunch of people in Isis that have fucking billions of dollars that are getting this money from is what I'm talking about. They exist, of course, oil families. There's a lot of those, a lot of sources, a lot of motherfuckers. And when you see who they're being funded by, you know like you ain't going to fall for that cover story.

Speaker 4:          01:43:14       That's all bullshit that they, I don't think you're right. I think it's both. That's what I think. I think everybody's going after it. They're trying to stop by Esis, man. There's nobody trying to stop by isis that are encouraging it. They're not. They love it. They need it. I don't know if that's the case. What does it say in case you didn't know? The United States funds and arms, terrorist groups like al Qaeda and Isis when it needs them to disrupt a country. This is doctor Jill Stein who was running for president. She said this the day of Christmas. She doesn't give a fuck. That bitch is roots thankless. Woke as fuck. She's, whoa. That's what I'm talking about. Doctors chills when you know this and it makes sense. You could follow the, you're like, okay, totally

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       makes sense. A criminals is, oh yeah, it makes sense. Criminals do this kind of shit. Well, you should always, always be suspected. The people running the show, they're criminals through. So you never, you never go, oh, you know, if someone tells you, uh, someone's obsessed with like, let's say, you know, some famous killer, I don't know, uh, like John Gadi or whatever, some criminal or whoever and he's obsessed with them and he knows a lot of shit about this murder, that murder, this racket, that racket. This is this criminal activity. Uh, when, if he told you, yeah, you, you know what other murder he was involved in and you talk about it, no dude's going to say, uh, now how do you know that's true? How do you know that's true? Where's the evidence that you probably going to go? You take his word for it.

Speaker 3:          01:44:34       This guy's, this guy's a criminal. He's fucked up all this other shit. And then he tells you about some new shit. He fucked up. You're probably like a, like a normal God go. Yeah. Even if he's wrong. I mean, he's still a criminal, but probably I haven't looked into it, but it's like that when, when you, when you could follow the money so easily and you just see the racket and you're just like, oh man, anytime cns is attacking fake news, they're creating a fake news problem. And I didn't follow what you were saying there until you got to know what you're talking about. You're talking about, uh, the, uh, the government's reason for, for paying a UK publicity from $500 million to make fake isis and al Qaeda videos. To me, $500,000 or 500 million, those 450, to me, I don't want to be in the wrong about that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       You know, we need wrong 500,000. Let's say it's 500 million. That's thought it was 450 million. So when you see, when you see that, let's say you just saw that quote and you believed it. Let's say she's right. Okay. Just pretend she's right. Who, whatever. That, that chick, that Jill Jill Stein, she's talking about, andy is also funding the mujahideen, which we were pretty open about when they were there willing. That is, that's what became the Islamic terrorist of today. But that's what we, none of the funding tennis customer Russians, let me finish real quick, when you see a statement like that and there's many people saying that, but there's a man, there's one, just, just say that's true what she just said. And then you find out that the government paid $500 million to make fake isis videos, the funding numb and then they're making fake isis videos. Sounds like they want to blow that shit up.

Speaker 3:          01:46:12       You know? So when you see the cover story, when the government says the criminal says the criminal says, ah, what we were doing is we were making cds and we were like dispersing them and then so that people would get them and then they would play them. And you know, you know, we, we did only a terrorist would play that cd, so then we could track their ip address. To me that's like some serious horse shit. No, but we do it the same with like in the drug industry. If they catch a drug dealer they they flip him or use him for some to get to the bigger play there, which is the drug kingpin. Right, so same thing with this. They might, they might fund those ridiculous videos. You sounded like that the are criminal but no Eddie, the problem is you think there's only one way to this.

Speaker 3:          01:46:54       I think there's a like a, a lack of nuance in the, the, the idea of this. I think it's both. I think for sure the government is going to make some fake shit. I mean they told us they were going to do it to fight the war on crime or in the fight. The war on terror. They told us they were going to do that. They told us they were going to do it. They do it in plain sight. Then of course, of course go along for sure 100% but also there's also people that are in charge of making sure it's not like everybody who is in the CIA or the FBI or any of these organizations is like a part of some gigantic said that, when did I say that? But never said okay. Only but the people. But the idea that the, all the rest of them would know that it's bullshit and that would go along with it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:33       I don't think that's the case. I think what they're trying to do is figure out ways where they could locate terrorists if they figured out a way they could located terrorist. And it's through Ip checking of people who watched terrorist recruitment videos. I don't think that's a bad idea. It might not get everybody and it might not even work, but it's not a bad idea. They're doing a decent job. Have you seen now just switch subjects a little bit, but how have you seen on a second? Just don't, don't you think that there's a w there, there's gotta be some way. If there are legitimate terrorists in the world and you're trying to find them, he's gotta be some way to find them. That's a good way to find them. I Ip addresses, if they're clicking on those videos, funding them, why would they try to find them really who's going yet?

Speaker 3:          01:48:09       He is at the same people. That's my point. Is it the same people that pitch, but that does, that's one person. Eddie, this is the same people that are in charge of making these videos to try to find these people. Are they the same people that are also completely aware that they're funding them or is there a bunch of different factions all working together and each one of them doesn't completely be honest with the other? Yeah, I could see that. Definitely most of the CIA, most of the FBI, good, honest, hardworking people. It's just people keep people in certain spots there. I mean, they're funding Isis. That's just one quote. There's many, many quotes, but let's just say that was true, that quote that with that chick said, that's true. Okay. We're funding CIC, presidential candidate Jill Stein.

Speaker 3:          01:48:58       She's not the first one to say that, but anyways, right. Let's just say what she, that statement is true. If it's true on Christmas, if it's true, if they're funding Isis, yes. There's probably a low level people saying, hey, how are we going to stop isis? But the overall agenda is not to stop it. The overall they're funding it. Why they going to stop it? They want to blow it up. The funding it. You'd put two and two together though. Crip. First of all, the criminals at the top. We know that. Everybody knows. Everybody know that, so we we, we got to treat them like a detective would like your average bullshit as detective would go this criminal, the no one would ever know detective would ever look at a criminal. God. There's no way he would do that. He doesn't have the time to do.

Speaker 3:          01:49:42       He does not that smart. He doesn't have the smarts that he's so unorganized. This guy would, this guy, he, no detective would say that. It'd be like, you know what? You're fucking criminal. Let's look. Maybe you are innocent. Maybe you are, but God damn, look at the money trail, look at all this circumstantial evidence. It's just damn, you know, look at it. And then the hardcore evidence documents and Shit, if you ask isis, they're not going to tell you they're winning. Like they're getting fucked up. Who knows what they're saying? They're funding them and they have control of the media. Who fucking knows what the fuck is going on? Who really knows? Nobody knows what the fuck's going to see how isis used to use twitter and certain things. So as they would get, you know, followers to see stuff and organize plans. Will twitter has a, someone who's just 24, seven, Merck's those accounts where he can't have them anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       Now that use telegraph, you know what that is or they can send a, uh, it's a, you can organize a private chat room so he can whatever, they have us code words. All those isis followers go there and then they ha they logged in and they somehow some guy got into it cause you have to prove everyone in the secret chat rooms and it says what they want to do. And they'll say, uh, just crazy example in milwaukee. How many guys do, they'll say, how many guys do we have? And there's seven, but we have these guns. These guns were going to hit up this, oh I scouted, I did this. So they're going to, the guy owns telegraph going, what the fuck man, stop these accounts. And he's like, ah, you know, I created so everyone can use it, man. These high level security I create for that and this dude just get in fucking reamed for it. Does he not have the abilities and Russian? He does have the Barista. He's in Russia. But what happens is these accounts go up and then after you're done there they their race forever. That's why people use them. Wow. Interesting. Israeli hackers have said this. It's crazy time, dude. It's a crazy time. Cause you, yeah. And then he, his point, he goes, I didn't create a fucking telegram for Isis, but just like anything, we create some good,

Speaker 4:          01:51:36       it's bad. People follow. I can't control any, what was that guy that he kept telling me about? Was it Gary Vanerchuck? Is that the guy? Yeah, I saw an interview with him, man in that he was talking about people, I'm using phones and this lady goes, isn't it terrible what we're doing to these young people using phones? And he was like, look, this is you. You're looking at human evolution. We're not doing anything. These people, this is like, this is what people are doing and you know, just step back and look at what's happening. And he was saying that because we're just going to be looking in the future back at this time, like this is the good old days before virtual reality for sure. It seems to me that all these things are competing together, that taking over, taking over various aspects of the world, controlling global resources like oil and things along those lines. And they are windmills now that assigns a fucking seven 47. Have you seen these gigantic windmills that they're putting together trying to figure out how to dominate the production of electricity and oil and gas and keep money flowing and all the while we're getting drawn deeper and deeper into this electronic world. Like we've got some weird shit going on in our future folks. Weird Matrix style shit.

Speaker 3:          01:52:40       Did you see in Dubai? They're already, they're building it now that we're those tubes so you can get from Dubai to wherever in like 30 minutes. Hyperloops uh, Elon Musk is the one that came up with it, but uh, in Dubai, the the first ones to actually fund it and raise the money and they're building it now. That's scary. That's a plane on the ground on now, son jumping a tube and just imagine the feeling of going 500 miles an hour, 500 mile an hour, a hyperloop train. That's not that fast. It takes you from Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 12 minutes with Smith's son. That's amazing. They're saying if they do it right in America, you can be able to live in la, work in New York every day. Oh my God. Fuck all that. Jumping in that first. You're going to be in that too. For what? At least 500 miles an hour.

Speaker 3:          01:53:28       It's going to five hours. No, no. That star that's just started to fuck you on must saying like 1200 miles an hour is what there is. What they're planning 500 miles an hour aside to think what like a plane flies. I don't think it's any faster than a plane. I can go underground. That's true. Yeah, so 500 miles an hour in a plane, but it takes you five hours. This is across the country for five hours. It's, it's inevitable. They're going to do it. It's going to be five hours now it's 12 miles, 1200 miles an hour. That's probably two and a half, two and a half hours to get tenured. A long time to do a long time. Go. Going to fast. Comfortable too. When you can walk around this tube, maybe it's uh, how big is this tube? Is it worse? Is it worse?

Speaker 3:          01:54:17       This smell, people's farts in a tube going 500 miles now on the ground or in a tube going 500 miles an hour in the sky. The Sky, the plan. How often do you just say fuck it, I cannot hold these motherfuckers. You let him so fucking, that shit is so rude. Cause most of the time you hold it in right most of the time and try to time it. You got a bathroom, you gotta do right? He's got damn good. Nailed it man. You ever just said, fuck it, I'm just going to go for it and whatever. I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed. Put your eye shades on the tender asleep. They just let them go. Dudes do that to me all the time. This guy decided to just go for it. I'm like, I don't know. It could either be this guy or that guy that recycled air, just fucking your world up. It's gotta be like a suction thing in your and the seat. So like a little button you press and it soaks. It does help. That shit does help a lot. They say, oh it's pretty good. It was probably for the farts. For the fights. Probably broad. You have a fucking fat wherever in a restaurant. Do you have a fan blowing on you? It blows. That's hard. Yeah. They need to fix that problem and claim for the farts and they never talked about it. Mark fans for 500% or you know what? Back when people used to smoke on planes, that's when they had them remember that these to smoke

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       on planes and then it got to the point where you could only smoke in the back. So they had a smoking section. Yeah, I used to fly back then. He was crazy. You would? I would be in those sections man. Cause I was, I would be, that's where he could buy tickets. People just like, they would say the only tickets that are available, the smoking section and it would cost less. You go into that fucking smoking section, just sit down people around your light and home in a two. Meanwhile you come on the whole craze smoking cessation point though. Yeah. Dice clay used to have a little bit about it. We're in a fucking toe. Don't have to go back to everybody's breathing the same fucking hell bit about a man. It was fucking hilarious. Yeah, it has a weird time when people used to go to smoke everywhere in restaurants, in Bar, everywhere you went, you would see people smoking movie theaters.

Speaker 4:          01:56:35       Now I love that. We tell you not to smoke in movie theaters where people would do it all the time. People get mad at him. Hey man, put it out. That was one of those laws that was at, that's what I mean. The government work. Totally Shit. Well, you know what was a good law? You know why? Because people were filing lawsuits. A lot of people that worked inside restaurants and bars, they were getting cancer, lung cancer from secondhand smoke. Imagine if your job was to be a waitress and you got to go to this fucking bar everyday people go, oh, gives you shoot booger. Well, it's a good job. Why should you be subject to being poisoned at a good job? Like you have to like, it's a crazy, it's not like drinking. If you're drinking and I'm not drinking, I'm right next to you.

Speaker 4:          01:57:14       I don't suffer anything. Yeah. But if you're smoking right next to me, and especially if you work in a place where everybody's smoking, man, you're going to die. Strip club baby. I never got him to cigarettes. You guys are flipped with cigarettes. No, but I've had them before. Go on stage before with Tony Hinchcliffe. I've taken a smacks snacks. He does. Yeah. They fire you up dude. It's like a, it gives you, it's a stimulant. It's, it's a, it's very much like a nootropic really very, very bad for your body for sure. But stimulant in itself, like tobacco is a stimulant for sure. 100%. I'll give you, um, if you could chew, I think it would probably be the better move. Like Donald gave me some of those chew when I was here and I was like, whoa. Like this stuff fires you up, gets you kind of like buzz.

Speaker 4:          01:57:56       Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. That's what that was. Smoked cigars, Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. I don't know me from trying to load so that down and trying to cut way back on the Bros. But occasionally they sneak through the broan is if they ruined bro by con con. Anybody who's an asshole, bro. Come on Bro. He's a bro, you know. But um, yeah man, for sure. Like there's a, there's no doubt about it. It's, it's a definite stimulant. Like if you smoke a cigar, you get a buzz. You don't see a lot of smokers these days though. They're smart. People are smartening up. Well, you hang out with athletes. I hang out with zero athletes. There you hang out with comedians that don't smoke. Yeah. Comedians don't smoke these days way less. Way less. It used to be almost everybody. Swiss deleah doesn't even drink. Yeah. Well he never

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       drank, drank or smoked. There's a lot of guys who don't drink. Um, but back in the day, man, most guys smoked like are used to smoke dunkin used to smog. Joe Use a small red bands still smokes now. No, I never smoked. No, no athlete. Yeah, I was, well, I was healthy. I was still working out. Yeah. Like all the time I was doing standup in the beginning, I was kickboxing then like got to Jujitsu. I did Jujitsu straight through. Like I never, I never didn't actually say you can't smoke cigarettes and do Jujitsu, but you're going to get taught, you're going to miss a lot. And it's tough. I mean, you're, you're not just working out, you're playing a game of death and if you tap out because you fucking gas out that you got tapped out and then never feels that good. That's what Jujitsu is.

Speaker 2:          01:59:20       So, uh, people get obsessed with it. So, so much. You guys, why Joe Schilling is a crazy example. He's crazy. He smokes. Joe Schilling is a worldclass kickboxer and he smoked smoking all the time. Hello? Pack a day. Wow. That's amazing. They say smokes a pack a day. Not In Kansas coming back, but I think he was up to that. Yeah. Yeah. Not In quippy. Little while did it again. It needs to get on them. Robot dicks suck on one of them. Robot decks, those, uh, those vaporizers. Bill strawberry clouds. They do smell nice too. I don't mind if people do that. I don't think it gives you the buzz that a cigarette though though. I think cigarette gives you a very specific buzz. I think it was just chemicals, all that thick smoke. There's a fucking, if Eddie wants to come back and talk more theories on conspiracies, which is always wonderful.

Speaker 2:          02:00:07       Those fantastic. He's so mad. We barely talked about the UFC. Everybody's so mad right now. Zero option. They're a shit what we do and it's what we do. We're all like, yeah, UFC capacity. So much fun. So much fun. We saw the time but um, they did the FDA approved like 500 plus chemicals and to put them in a cigarette. So all designed to make you more and more addicted to. But did you know, cigarettes a never been less popular and uh, my generation they think is going to be the final kind of strongly get rid of smoking. Cause now it's just, it's more of a healthier kind of vibe now with millennials and stuff like that. So smoking is, you're fucked. Like really? No one's doing it. I wonder if too, we'll carry on. They need more of those dudes that get their jar removed.

Speaker 2:          02:00:54       See Lung cancer, because we're up here, we're in California. If we're down south in Georgia or some shit like that it, but that she went left and right to the point he had like a hidden camera and you put it on the chew section of a store on a fucking choose locked Pelican calm. Chewies shoot. People who Chew Chewies I dunno. You could, you could do, do what? Do Your chewy like have a club. Yeah. Yeah. You don't think they called tooheys? That's going to work? No. Oh well, um, we were talking about the smoke. You can chew and like Donald has fantastic cardio and he chews or dips. Was it a different, she'll dip, dip, dip paired the same thing. But the shoe was like, remember those old school baseball players look like? Yeah, they have

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       that shit like Lenny Dykstra. Yeah. You know, it's really crazy, man. That is probably very similar to what it feels like when you're chewing cocoa leaves. But the coca leaves are illegal. Like when those guys in Peru, they take those coca leaves and they put them in the side of their mouth and they chew on them and they showed them all the time. And you get, you also get actual vitamins from the flavonoids, I guess. God Damn Cell. Look at that guy. That many. Yeah, that's cat Jamie. That's the wrong stuff. You want to coca leaves that, that's God. That's a stimulant or a, a narcotic rather. That cat stuff is very much like a, not a narcotic. It's like meth. Dan's us. Yeah. It makes it crazy. They do a lot of crazy shit on it, but this stuff is a coca leaves. They take it and they pack their mouth with it and they chew on it and it has an effect, a stimulant effect.

Speaker 4:          02:02:32       It's similar to a cup of coffee. I've never done it, but I have had, um, a tea that was made out of it as a Matteto [inaudible] tea. Crunk no, but I couldn't shut the fuck up, which is always a problem already. It was like, are awesome depending on what your job is. No, it wasn't. Coke was, I wasn't jacked. I don't know. I've never done cuts. Work coat comes from, right? Yes, exactly. But it's chewing the leaves versus the processed soup. It's like the difference between getting your sugar from eating an orange versus eating like a couple of tablespoons of like real processed sugar. What? Like your body's like, what the fuck is this? Like where the hell is this shit coming from body doesn't know what the fuck you do with like a spoon of sugar. It's like Whoa, why is this alone? Where's, where's all the fiber?

Speaker 4:          02:03:18       Where's the fucking vitamins? This is just shit. What did you do? You crazy assholes. That's what cocaine is and that's why I can fuck with fruit. Cause the fiber, right? Cause they breaks down different and that's why I think these people that chew these cocoa leaves, they get a totally different experience than someone who does coke. I need to try it though. I never chewed the leaves. You'd be done with two popular to those should be legal bro. It should be 100% legal. It's illegal. The pride. You can't even have those leaves. The problem is you could take those leaves, you can process it into cocaine, which by the way is an actual ingredient and cocacola still cocaine is still, yes. Yes it is. They take coca leaves, they processed the coca leaves and they make medical cocaine with it. And the same plant that does this, the same processing place it does this ships the flavors of it to Coca Cola.

Speaker 4:          02:04:06       So it's one of the main flavors they use. Got Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola are two totally different tasting things I've enclosed. And one of the reasons why they taste different is coca cola used to have cocaine in it and now it's flavored by coca leaves. Google that coke is so much better than Pepsi Cooler that they still look at this, look at this. To this day dude, coca extractions is, it's got cocaine free leaves are sold to Coca Cola. Exactly. So they take these cocoa leaves, the factory processes them, turns him into medical cocaine and the rest of the shit that's processed

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       without cocaine in it is shipped to Coca Cola flavor knowledge. Hey, the medical cocaine when it's medical lidacain um, which is uh, one of the things that they use. It's like the gay cousin of cocaine they use it for, doesn't get you high but it numbs you up. Damn. Um, yeah. It's um, we took a lot of Coca Cola. They must be making a lot of medical cocaine man. Oh yeah. They must be making ridiculous amounts of it. I wonder how much the actual flavor they get out of the leaves versus actual cocaine. It's probably taken a lot of leaves to get cocaine's last time you had like a nice ice cold Coke Cola. I don't drink. It's terrible. It's terrible. I had a diet coke last night though. Well that's even worse. That's even worse. That shit is rarely do. But it said fuck it. It's Christmas dude. I did too.

Speaker 2:          02:05:26       And I had a regular coke, regular coke. That shit is delicious. So good barbecue. Come on. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and run down to the 24 hour liquor store and get a couple cans of coke and just like down in one drink. I had a drink hold cans in one drink. How was obsessed with sodas? Man, think about how much sugar, how much sugar in my throat. I'm addicted to that one. I just want the constant burn when it's cold too. Ooh, that's nice. That's nice. Pace the same. It does not taste the same out of those fucking fountains. You better stop calling that call. Look at that show your Goddamn Liar. That is not the same formula. You get to be out of Pfoa at 100% gotta be out of a can or a bottle or a bottle or that Mexican bottle with that cane sugar. But that green bottle, no, the ones that you get at certain stores, Coca Cola Green cause that's how you know having a pure cane sugar. Oh, green green's a different kind of is. They don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Again, Nicola [inaudible] worlds are attacking people.

Speaker 2:          02:06:37       Speaking to Paige vanzant, Michelle waterson. Not to be confused with Michelle Waterman. Ron Waterman, a coca cola life cane sugar and Stevia bullshit. Is this a new one? To put Stevia? Stevia is a good move. But cane sugar and Stevia, they put like a little, a little dab of Stevia and a bucket of sugar. Get that poison on my fucking face. People know Z. Do you, have you ever tried that? Oh, look at that. Oh yeah. Yeah. We have some here. We have saw. I love that stuff. They sent me a bunch of it. Not even paying me to say it. And we drag it on air, didn't we? I Dunno. What is it? It's soda flavored with Stevia. They make an energy drink. It's good. Stevie's good man. I like it. It doesn't fuck with you. I like to put it in coffee. Doesn't, doesn't fuck with your blood sugar levels. Tastes better. I agree. He's, no, it doesn't seem to have any negatives. I mean, I don't know what it's like if you abuse it, but I think he had a hundred oranges. Your body's going to feel like shit. I'll let you know. Cause I abuse the shit out.

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       Yeah. According to Dan Quinn now it's a, yeah, that guy is on the ball. So let's talk about I'm dominick Cruz and cody garbrandt man. Uh, yeah, two hours into the podcast people are like, fuck, fuck, it's, it's a boxing. It's a Coke Cola. But this is what happens when you have a producer or like, you know, engineer or a rather, uh, executive. Uh, you look at the, we'll get the money line code. He's not that big of an underdog. Well, cody's fucking dangerous. Super Dangerous. Here's the question. Like, is he ever faced anybody that moves the way dominic does? And we've seen with so many guys that they have a really hard time hitting dominic. He's a really hard time to hit. Okay, so dominic is a two to one favorite, correct? You know, which is a, I'd say that's, well, cody's one 75, so the real, the real spread is only 35 cents on a dollar a dollar bet.

Speaker 6:          02:08:28       Not, not crazy. No. That's swear. She got good. Dominic is what they're banking on. I think. You know, cody hasn't Mizzou. [inaudible] is best win, which was his last fight. So that's what got him this title shot. Here's something bank on him landing on Dominic. Here's something that people aren't talking about. Linacre and Tj dillashaw is on the same card. That's a crazy fucking fight. Linacre scary. Lineker super scary. He's terrifying. Building that little monkey. He's built like a chimpanzee dude. He like like a a pounder. And when I say a little racist, ladies and gentlemen, I call myself a month 35. Just want to specify Linacre wasn't any one 25. Yes, he was one 25. You wouldn't make the way that he has. He has a real talent and he has real power at that was scary. Scary guy. Hemmer cody's the hardest hitters. That latter one fight. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          02:09:19       a different kind of hit her though. I think cody is lightning fast and like beautiful combinations and beautiful footwork, better technique. The angles that he cut when he knocked out. Um, uh, Thomas, uh, I made up when he knocked out Thomas Almeda like Amanda was undefeated, very scary and he cut some serious fucking angles and drop some bombs on him. I was like, whoa. Cody's back speed of entry. His uncle was alternative Olympic boxer. His Dad was a boxer and they just put this little ball of hate and to him, but he's a ridiculous wrestler to his kind of knockout power is a different kind of knockout power. Then Linacre Linacre is almost like a guy that is 20 or 30 pounds bigger than him. It's weird like he hits guides and you see them like, oh, like he's hitting you on the arms with these bombs and he takes a shot extremely well.

Speaker 6:          02:10:08       Like when he fought a Francisco, um, when you, when you watched the, the combination of those two guys unloaded in the first round, you're like, Jesus Christ. Francisco Rivera is a bad motherfucker, a very good striker. And he just decided to go to war with Linacre and Leonard who was just dropping bombs on them and you go, Jesus, he can do this even at one 35 maybe be even better at one 35. I and I, and I love to watch linacre fight. I don't think in for right now, I don't think could be championed with his, with that style of fighting. Don't and only boxing watch what happens. Watch what happens when Tj, cause it's easy to game plan for Tj and Dwayne lug width and go, all right, this is what we do and you're gonna see him. Angles makes it it up. I'm excited about it because I think tj spectacularly talented, no doubt, and Tj has amazing footwork and all that, the Duane system.

Speaker 6:          02:11:00       But Leonard has got something special. Man, I'm, I've, I've very rarely seen a guy at his weight class that hits people the way he does. It's a very, it's an almost like good, he's doing a different thing. Yeah. It's different kind of months or those fights are very similar where cody garbrandt just needs one to win the fight. Linacre needs one to win the fight. Dominic Cruz footwork's ridiculous. Tj dillashaw is footwork. Ridiculous. But you've got to think, you know, Tj Kol Hanan Barao twice dropped him in the first round with a straight right hand. It's not like Tj doesn't have power and Tj hooker power, he doesn't have the same kind of power, but he's got way more options as far as movement, you know? So it's going to be very interesting to see how you have this movement came and remember that fight only three routes, which hurts.

Speaker 6:          02:11:40       I finished Tj, tj because he's got to survive the storm. Yeah, Tj because tj moves so good man is hard. Like in the brow fight you saw it like right away, browse. Got that like linear style presses for five rounds though, right of that footwork's gonna that's gonna be hard to follow. If you're that straight forward pressure fighter for championship rounds, you're like Jesus Christ and starts wearing on you and then tj takes over. That's interesting. That's a good point. I think Tj uh, is, is definitely in a tricky situation because he wanted that rematch, wanted that title fight. He was really close in the first fight with dominick Cruz. It was a real close person. You just told me they were like, you won that fight. I think Dana even agreed was like, you won that fight man. It's a very close fight, no doubt about it.

Speaker 6:          02:12:23       Well, whoever you believe won that fight and then dominic goes on and beat Shariah and beat them handily. And now dominick is stepping in to fight him and he's got a, he's, he's a fighting cody and he's got a really tough fight on that, on that same card and a really tough fight where if he loses that fight, fuck man back in the line. This is, and this is a guy with that is missed wait a couple of times and Linacre is like kind of tricky in that situation where he's Ms. Wade if at featherweight or I miss wait rather at a flyweight yeah a couple of times. And it hasn't he Ms. Wade at Bantam weight to one. Yeah. So this is a guy that's going to come and biggest fuck is very dangerous. Hit super hard. Like in a creepy way. Creepy hard almost. So almost like a, it's almost like a heavyweight fight for Tj cause you make one mistake in lineker lands, it's over.

Speaker 6:          02:13:11       You're fighting dom, you make some mistakes and get lit up. He's not going to end your night show, pull up linacre versus Macdonald. Macdonald is a fucking straight killer. That kid's a bad motherfuckers. Yet the patient has had some injuries. Yeah. I had some injuries lost to Uriah. Uriah mauled him. That was the big one. When you're I in Merch, dumb cause that he finally came back and then you at Merck dumb, he went away. It was one over your eyes. Finest performances. You're right. Cracked him with a right hand, got ahold of that neck and just put the full uriah on them as far as his, uh, his key, a teen that mounted guillotine just fucking, but it's almost like the one 35 tournament cause you have, you know, you have a cody and dom, they have Tj Linacre. The loser's going to fight the loser winner's gonna fight the way.

Speaker 6:          02:13:52       Yeah, let's watch, check out that if you could to find that fine. Linacre versus Michael McDonald. Kao I had it but it didn't pull up it wrong. Fifer oh these sons of bitches areas. So like Michael McDonald, like real classical style, real good at punching power. Not built like a scary guy, but a vicious knockout artists like one of those guys where the body really sort of, uh, is uh, is very deceptive. And remember he was like top, top prospect. He was a big, big prospect to see Uriah or Hanan Barao first he lost a hand and Barao. Right, and then he came back and fought uriah. Wasn't that the case? How tall is linker? He's short. He's short, but he's about the same height as dwight cow. Five says. I don't know. I don't, they don't think he is. Honestly. I think he's five four. He's a small little dude.

Speaker 6:          02:14:40       He's a small guy but hits like a fucking mack truck. Almost creepy in his power man. Like and in so confident in it too. But again, to the point where I don't think he's going to be champ. You look at a guy like John Dotson who just outworked them and I thought he lost that fight. Granted they gave it to Lynika. Yeah, well it was close enough. I mean, oh look, look, he heard him there. Look, he heard him there. You could see Mike McDowell steps back and it's like, oh Jesus. There's a feeling that guys get when he connects on them when you see it in their eyes. So like, Holy Shit, this is a different thing here. It's a, it's a, that's not snowflake. That's not snowflake move. Yeah, no. And he's, he's also got a ridiculous Chin when he foot, when he stood in front of Rivera, it's going like this, like, come on.

Speaker 6:          02:15:24       They were just banging it out. And Rivera fun but rare flattens people. So as you watch like Linacre walk them down here, you're looking at this kid who's just got unique power. Well, like really unique. And even a guy like, oh, look at that. Boom. Michael McDonald recognize he goes down there, I look, he goes down again, boom, boom, boom, boom. And linacre just stands in front of them, bites on his mouthpiece and fucking malls on Mcdonald. Landed one deal and Linacre ate it like a tic TAC. And he's moving forward. Boom, take home. And he rocks him again. And he's just undeniably confidence in his ability to walk you down and smash. You. See what you can't do as loan back yet and get your back against the kids. You gotta move, man. See I've heard him again times more, 10 times more, 100% but the question is, is there going to be exchanges were dillashaw is inside of his range and we'll one of these things land and once one of those things do land, we'll dillashaw continue to engage the same way like boom, boom, boom.

Speaker 6:          02:16:20       Or will it be over right lands. But tj takes a good shot and has never been a guy to stand in front of you like this and Oh look at that. And we see his head gets snapped out. What [inaudible] talking about. It's very rare that anybody has that kind of destroying power. Remember that? Remember Tj can wrestle too, so if they're getting close he'll take his ass down. The difference between him and Dotson at one 35 and I liked Dotson at 35 I think he's better at 35 then 25 I just think he just kills himself too much to make that weight. Like when you fought GAM Berrien is dotson can sneak in on you and your son too. And when they fought, did they fight at 35 or 25 when it came bands and, and uh, and Linacre fought does at 25. Is it 100% of the 25?

Speaker 6:          02:17:05       Yeah. Is it, you might be right. I don't think that's the right weight class for dots. And I think Dodson we'd be at both guys. I think both guys were way better off without destroying themselves. Those are fun fights man. And then on the pre the fs one prelims are stacked. You got Neil magni versa. What's that catch weight? One 36 and a half wait or no? So it must've been like a last minute decision to, to have that fight. So That's interesting that Dodson and him went to war and linear one that decision. Yes, I 35, but I thought, um, you talked about some one. Yeah. Um, here's the other thing about Tj. You got to think how long has tj really been with Duane Ludwig and he continues to get better with Duane Ludwig? It's only been a few years. So in the last couple of years, like we, you know, we will do, we've seen, we've seen the two big fights with Hana barrao where he marked him, right, which are the all time career highlight performances.

Speaker 6:          02:17:55       Right. Joe especially the second one that Joe Soto fight, which was an interesting fight because taking a real tough guy on a real short notice today, none day, one day during the way in trying to make weight falls asleep and bangs his head on the wall because he cut too much weight. Joe Soto steps in. And so tj makes that adjustment, wins that fight coming back, beats the shit out of Barao and the rematch like really dominated him in the rematch. Those are like, you know, real highlight reel finishes, all three of those fights. So then, uh, he goes from that, the really close lost to Dominick Cruz and then beats a sun sal. Like he took a chance with a sun sal. A sense. Yeah. He beat us on site, look better in the sun south fight. Then he did in the first time they fought. So he's showing improvement just in that fight.

Speaker 6:          02:18:38       You just got to wonder what this is going to look like, what linacre versus him is going to look like. Very, very interesting fight. Great. Matchups fuck yeah. That one particular, what do you think about cody and Dominic? Do you think the code he's going to be able to, like when you look at cody move and you see his success against guys like to Gawky against guys like Thomas Almeda and then you see what dominic does to people. He's in front of you. He's not. He's, he's shuffling stances. He's off to the side. He's got his hands down. He's moving in this really fucking weird way. That's real tough to emulate. I love cody, but the x factor, here's, we haven't really seen them. Faith top competition. Mizzou [inaudible]. He's older. He got merck before from Dominic. Ben. He gets murked by cody. We saw promise in Almeda. We saw him fight a really promising God. Again, young guy, not level of dominick Cruz

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       or we haven't seen with the movement. Right? The thing that I like about cody, so damn game, I was talking to a lance palmer at team alpha male and they're like, we've never seen theme like it, like fight week. If he sees someone and he needs to work on this, but he's just young and hungry. He goes, if he sees someone from the other camp, he tries to fight them in the hallway. He's just like this pit bull man and he's just so god competitive. They're like, wait, we have to have a coach with them at all times, author. He won't leave. He won't leave the gym. If you see someone else from the camp tries and fight some, but don't think that that's a waste of energy. 100% he's young. He's young. It could be an exaggeration though. Could be for sure. You have had a problem with one dude once.

Speaker 2:          02:20:06       We're sure Friday bravo now a sudden talking. Reasonable now taught now. Now talking common sense. That sounds like fake news. Let's go over the rest of the car and popped the whole card. Jamie. The big thing on this is, um, can cody Land Kenny? But Kenny, keep up for again, five. It's five rounds. It's five fucking rounds, man. Do you think about anything about these guys? They're both real good man. They're both real good, good ground fighters to Louis Mocha and Ray Borg. That should be a very interesting fight. Fun Fight. This card. It sucks. Cause how about Canaan? Verdo [inaudible] the guy that pulled out on a, he was supposed to be fighting, um, uh, Ian and pull down on real short notice. Remember that smoke? It was fun to watch or got hurt. He's really both fun to watch as small. Got For an American Russian or actually from the eastern bloc? No, he's American American. He's like, yeah. Where's Louis [inaudible]?

Speaker 2:          02:21:03       I Dunno where Louis is from. It. What sucks is cane for doom off. That'd be fun. Hawaii. Oh, he's Hawaiian. That's right. Dot. Last Samurai. That's why it's Da. That's right. His Dad's probably rushing them. Sao Dare you come on. Small gun. Is that a, is that a Russian name? Hell yeah. You go back to that on man. I don't know anything. Smoker, smoker. What is that? Uh, when you say it like that, that on slide done it smoke a bro. Um, whereas where's, what's his ethnicity? It just might be Hawaiian dude. He might just be straight Hawaiian. Get on Brazil. And his nickname is a wiki page. Does he have a weed smoke? You might be a mad stoner and he's Hawaiian is fuck yeah, he looks pretty fucking Hawaiians are killing it, huh? Holloway. Oh yeah, man. Well that's a crazy island. When you're stuck on an island with dudes and you got a problem with them, you can't just fucking drive away.

Speaker 2:          02:21:52       Like that's a completely different mindset. You can't drive way. Got It. I'll live in an island. You're hanging out together on a volcano. It doesn't say anything about his ethnicity. He's Hawaiian, Bro. That's why this shit, man. Let's go to the uh, Amanda Nunez. Ronda rousey fight. If you got to put some money down, what do you, what do you think, man? Who the fuck knows? I love saying who the fuck knows because you, we haven't seen Ronda fight in over a year. We don't need your head. They're looking at her body. She's in insane shape. There's a pictures of her online throwing punches and you look at her back, you're like, yeah, oh, leash and seen him. She's down. She's down to fight. Wake. Wait already apparently you know, I think losing to someone like Holly Holm the way she did and to be tired and get beat up and the whole deal like look at her back there, which was punching the speed bag.

Speaker 2:          02:22:41       Jesus, that's, that's ridiculous. Damn. So if you think about the way she lost that fight and how she looked physically, she didn't look nothing like this. Like not even close. Like she's got all these videos of her running up hills and all this different stuff. She looks like way more fit. She got tired in the fight with holly and that was a big factor is also getting hit was a big factor. Getting stunned right away and but really solid conditioning will allow you to recover better than not being in such good shape. Especially when you get hit in the Ed. It's a, a big factor with the guys that are super, super fit is how they bounce back. You know, like, um, Neil Magni is a good example. You can stun that guy in the first round, but he's so fit. He bounces back for her to that, that holly fight.

Speaker 2:          02:23:26       You should, the one thing that Ron, she always comes to fight. She's always in shape. She takes that, you know, personal, it takes it, it Kinda upon herself. She did not have the same sort of dedication towards that fight with holly that she's got towards this fight. Physically it doesn't let us think. We know physically. You can say that, but we don't know cause she'd been shooting movies. She won't do Prescott. Right. You know what I'm saying? So we don't know. She could take her down her judo and not try to strike with, they're just clinch up. Do that judo trip. Take her down. Anybody's in danger of that arm bar. That's what she's so god, she's going to mandan and this could easily get caught in that arm bar. Wouldn't shock. Here's a question for age. He's got to drag her down. Here's a question.

Speaker 2:          02:24:03       Where do you guys, do you think she has the coaching to make changes where she just doesn't pull forward on a man Nunez and get punched in the face course she's going to become, of course she's going to take her time. Of course she's not going to go out there reckless. She's going to take your time. That's how she came round around Shit anyways, and it seems like common sense. Don't fucking get crazy. Get in there. Just fucking get the blood going. That's not her. That's not her. Eddie. She didn't get to man. That's a guy named Mike Tyson. Gay Sound Outside and Jab and do. She might try to overwhelm arm, but she's not stupid. She's going to learn from mistakes. They just fight a cleaner fight. More movement, more head movement. The surgery, she's had knee surgery since then. She could take Amanda down. I think she can take cat cat cats in Ghana had a real hard first round and the first round Amanda Nunez is beaten the shit out of her cat Nunez. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:24:51       Nunez. Cat Cat came back and stop new needs. That's either I got her on the back for a cardio. If, if Rhonda, again, it's tough because what makes Rhonda great is there's this flurry, there's the exchange. Next thing you know you're f she fucking hip toss you and you're an armbar. Right. And that's the thing. She's not really going to sit on outside. Be patient. That's not her. But if she can like if it's a dog fight, I think Rhonda, I ended up catching a fourth or fifth round cause Amanda, she starts off like a tidal wave and we've seen it in her losses. She kind of slows down. She just does. Yeah. Well it's going to be interesting to see if American top team has been able to do something to mitigate that. If they've, who knows what kind of strength conditioning program she's under now.

Speaker 2:          02:25:31       The only problem, I see it quite as quick. If Rhonda takes her down and ends up on top, she might have a hard time passing Amanda Nunez Guard and we'll see. Like Rhonda is not, she's not known for guard passing, so that could be a problem. Maybe she'd shake Craig scrambles Eddie. That's her thing, but it's a letter to him to get up. If she can get her on her back, how will she, she deal with passing the guard. She really doesn't. She goes to it and then she's going to transition from there. You got to deal with it. With a black belt in Jujitsu, you're going to have to deal with the guard pass. It's nine to really does submit anybody. It's not a fee. Rhonda could get on top of her that well. She is a black male shape. She submitted me. She tape.

Speaker 2:          02:26:10       She's a black belt in Jujitsu and a chair after mcmahon too. She battered both of them and submit both their asses and then different submission that she submits. Her Mcmahon. She submitted a cat. Definitely have submitted Misha. I got beat her up. No, not cat. I'm sorry. She submitted me Hsa. She submitted Nisha, that whole thing. She did the same thing to Sarah McMahon. I think she cracked her and then and then put her away with a choke. The one pretty sure the one thing she has over Rhonda in this fight, it's power. She has vicious power. Striking. And I say that's it. I'd say that if Rhonda does come at her full clip like that, it's a very risky proposition. She can crack so fucking hard. But if Rhonda feels like she can get closer to that, here we go. He's not shocking, man. Punch.

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       Right? She's not scary. Oh yeah. No, she's talking about Amanda. Amanda Nunez. So she's working girls. Only one shot. She's dropping them. And Shanna Blazer. No, she's marking girls. Yeah, she needed, Amanda does clench a punch as hard as any fucking woman in that division. She might be the hardest women puncher in the 135 she's the hardest one. And punched her outside of Cyborg. We'll sidewalks. Not One 35 just saying females in general. She's the hardest punch outs. Sideboards of difference. You want to see her fight. Watch this in my mind. Stays the same. Do you see the fight with me? I agree. Did you see her fight with me Sha Amanda Nunez? Nisha? I, yes, but I forgot all about, uh, Amanda knew this. Stopping Misha. She beat her up. She wanted to know. Okay. What about the Sarah McMahon fight? I don't know. 200 go before that. Because before that is when she was beat her up on the feet.

Speaker 2:          02:27:51       Yeah, I was there. She's got a nasty jab to match. He steps in. I'm going to distance to boom, boom. Good scramble. The question is like, is she going to, there's a big difference between dealing with Rhonda and dealing with Misha. Look, this is a mauling man. She beat the brakes off of her. Amanda. It's just putting it to me. Should tape and you just, she just has long ass punches too and then she gets her back. This size sounds out, if Rhonda is in the right frame of mind, I think she does Russia and like she usually does, probably eats a shot, but then she gets inside,

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       gets thrown under hook, takes her for a ride and submits in the first round. God, I hope nobody tests positive for anything to so many people to in pop. How about sideboard? Yeah, yeah. Game. Oh No, no matter what. It's for game fucking over men. Now everyone's goes told Ya fucking told Ya. I just borrow. No. Lactone is what they're saying it is. So Berona lactones a dht inhibitor, which is a derivative of testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone I used to rub that shit on my head. Excuse me. I was trying to keep my hair from falling out because of testosterone. Yeah, yeah. If you have the gene for it, dihydrotestosterone is what? Both of you beautiful heads of hair. Don't have that as my, come on dude, come on. My hair is falling out like it's fine. No, almost 50. His hair's beautiful. Thanks man. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          02:29:06       Thank you. [inaudible] dead. [inaudible] dead wasteland. When I was a kid or when I was in my, um, I guess I was probably in my twenties, I would, uh, rub this spirono lock Tane on my fucking scalp because it's a dht inhibitor and it inhibits dht. So when people take steroids or a woman takes steroids or a man who has that gene where the hair falls out, and if a man has that gene and he takes steroids is probably even worse. But if you rub that spironolactone on, it has a dht inhibiting effect. And I think if you take it orally, it also, um, it acts as a diuretic. And, um, there's also, uh, some uses as a masking agent. There's a whole bunch of different uses of this, like as a diuretic. It also has benefits as a masking agent and it also mitigates the effects of, uh, of taking steroids in females.

Speaker 6:          02:29:55       So there's a lot of stuff going on, red flags with that stuff. But the one on her side that she says it is, is that it's a, it's used as a diuretic, which appears to be true. That'd be great. She has a rise in and fights Gabi Garcia think about that. But what she said, she had some issues with their friends and their friends. She had some pet issues with birth control pills and then she was bloated because of birth control pills. So a doctor prescribed this to her off season, which is to try to deal with a look. I don't know, I ain't never cut that kind of weight before. But if you watch that outside the lines piece on her, uh, with the weight cutting, have you ever seen it? I've seen it in and it's horrific. Commissioner was like, I would never approve her to fight like sheet.

Speaker 6:          02:30:34       That's terrific. How she's fighting at one three, five should be illegal. Well, one 40 she never got 20 to 35 40 even when 40 you got to watch it, Eddie. It's, it's insane. Terrifying. It's insane. She's the way she should be able to do that around the fight and that's why she's saying she turned down those two title fights because I was given a shit. I'm like, who turns down title fights? Even though they made the division for, she's saying, I destroyed my body. I'm having depression. I'm having a horrible issues. My Body's just not ready to fight like I need to march. Well, when you talk to people, we talked to people that have caught like ridiculous amounts of weight like that, and then all of a sudden the body just goes, which just if something goes wrong and your body doesn't want to lose any weight anymore, your kidneys start aching. You get kidney stones. It could be some serious side effects. Cutting back highway two goats. Shit, man, it's so dangerous.

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       You're, you're literally getting to the door of death 24 hours before you enter into a cage fight. It's the craziest thing that we allow people to do an MMA and it's essentially in a lot of ways it's sanctioned, cheating, true sanction, cheating. He's trying to get out of them classes and then you've got to have a way to enforce them. What's, what's your, what's your idea? I think there's gotta be a way to get guys to fight people that are their size without having the same rigid wait structure where you have like one 55 and one 70 and one 85 any solutions? No, I don't. I think there's gotta be a way to check hydration levels and camp and there's gotta be a way you're going to have to blow the whole thing up though. Like champions won't be the champions in the same way class anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:32:03       But if you've got Chris Weidman to fight at his natural weight and another guy to fight at his you and how you determine that, you would have to find out what a guy ways when he's in shape and fit. And you would have to do this whole transition over a period of time. When that went along, comes in, that's when they're going to cut. No, you don't allow, you don't allow him to, there would also be like 20 belts. I'm in good shape. But you do the same thing that you do with Usada. You'd randomly test their hydration levels. You randomly test their weight. So if they're healthy and they're in camp, there's no way they're gonna keep that weight off the entire camp. It's impossible, but you can't. As long as it's close. It's like when cowboy cuts five pounds, that's normal. Like when you see cowboy, you don't go, you don't go.

Speaker 4:          02:32:41       There's no way. This dude is one 70 you look at him, you go, yeah, he looks like he's one seven. That's his real weight. When you look at Damien Maia, you like, there's no fucking way he's won 70 he's 200 pounds. When you look at like rick story, he's giant that like there's, there's some guys that cut the weight and then put it back on in a big way. Johnny Hendricks in his prime. Johnny Hendricks says prime would be Jack modified when he was Merkin, John Fitch and Marvin Capelin and those guys. So random wayins random. So for sure they're not going to be cutting the exactly what? No, they couldn't. And then whatever you weigh in at they, they let you cut five pounds of you need to or something like that. Something along those lines. You give a person like a five pound buffer. Yeah, it's super messy.

Speaker 4:          02:33:21       But yeah, it does get messy. But you also, I think you, you, you causing part of the problem with Wayans by having these very specific weight classes, like one 55 one 70 so then the problem would be determining who is a champion and what do you call that champion? You have a Builtin area because you know you, you'd say welterweight or middleweight or light heavyweight. Well you're not saying is the 155 pound champ. The names are kind of silly. Like why is welterweight one 70 and MMA but one 47 and boxing heavyweight boxing has been around forever. Why do we have different names or different weight classes for the same sport? But it doesn't matter. It's still everybody knows what a lightheaded off that. Yeah, it's still crazy. My point is instead have like lightweight middleweight have all these different names but have people actually way that like for a guy who's won 70 have an actual hundred 70 pound man, that's some crazy dude who gets to two 15

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       like like rumble Johnson is just too, how about this? How about that? That would work, but how hard would it be in the, you know, the random testing and all that shit and then the five pounds, one of the guys, six pounds. What you could do is that the two, the 48 hours before the weigh in, you're under control. You have, you have to have like you're in a hotel. Oh really? You can't do any extreme weight cutting? No. Weird back check in on Tuesday. I don't again, Burt's gone to the commission on, on what the fuck to do now, but they used to do as soon as you land, you don't check anything. You go to the room and they weigh you and if you're like 40 pounds, 40 pounds over there, you know they're on your man. Yeah. It makes sense. Yeah, that's it makes sense.

Speaker 2:          02:35:04       That's it. Yeah. You'd have to do enough to where you all the time and when they're all, yeah, they're all over it and you're weighing in every day. If you're red flag, then they'll tell Dana, hey, bad, good example guys. But they don't, they don't because the guy still miss cause like, Hey Kelvin's 30 pounds over weight and like, all right, well he's made it before. Yeah. You can't still can't have that, which you got to have is someone who doesn't allow anybody to fight 30 pounds over what they actually weigh in that it's not legal like Weidman cut, I want to say 37 pounds and three day Yoda. Yeah. When he fought Leo Machida, there's gotta be an official way in a few times. Yeah. Like they all got to throw your shit out camp. They do that in Abu Dhabi because it's a two day tournament and you got to wait if you make it to the Sunday, if you went a couple of matches and you get it to the semifinals and finals, you got to weigh in again.

Speaker 2:          02:36:00       Who did send fight when he cut all that way it was it Damien Maia? No, it wasn't a, it was in Abu Dhabi and he's cutting weight on the plane. Remind hose and I would dobby so he did. Was it, who did he fight? He fight [inaudible] no, it wasn't. No, it wasn't [inaudible] it was in Abu Dhabi. I remember I thought he, he was Damien Maia Boyz days and that was on Fox wasn't it? I find it uh, two immunos on that card. So was that Abu Dhabi when Bj Penn fought Frankie Edgar? It must've been cause the other Aboud Dobby card was when Anderson fought Damien Maia. Right. Those are the two that I went to. I don't think if the Fox card, no, you might. I think you're right. What do you think about the new rules that a big John McCarthy? Do you see that video? No, no, no. You replay. I didn't watch it.

Speaker 2:          02:36:47       He didn't watch your MMA encyclopedia. How could you not watch the new unified rules? The Big John McCarthy posted, you watched it, right? Yeah, it was Damien Maia basically bought a stand up fight against Damien Maia and it was on Fox. It was the second card on Fox and he cut short amount of weight in a law or a law. A lot of weight in a short amount of 22 pounds in 10 days. Insane. Insane. Like she too shy like you do. You get to death's door and then he's so it tough. Yeah. You can't do that. I still want, you know when fighters are against the cage and they put their hand on the mat so they don't get kneed in the face. Can't do that no more. That's all. You gotta have all four, uh, you have have both hands? No, they haven't had that starfish in 2017.

Speaker 2:          02:37:32       Yeah, it's a great rule. Hell yeah. It's a little, I mean, did they, did they talk about I or anything like that? I don't think so. They did talk about a clavicle grabs grabbing the collar. That used to be illegal. You could do that. I remember hearing the guy say that he could do that. Oh, just so many in the collarbone. Please do try that. Please do. Please try to like, I just kicked him in the knee. The column on those, the dumbest like you really think it's that easy. Yeah. Just going to get someone on their collar bone, I think collapses, right? Yeah. Dudes, they think they could just kick you in the knee and then they're going to have like a mobile icu. To your way point. A guy who could really benefit from that as Chris Weidman, he met light heavyweight. He should be a light heavyweight, I feel like.

Speaker 2:          02:38:17       Yeah, for sure. Well, Jon Jones should be a heavyweight then you know, John Jones fought Dan Henderson that grappling match. He was 238 pounds. I mean he murked cheeses, so wheezes. What a beautiful takedown. She's takedown. Yup. Oh my God, I love it. He shot in and Gary, Tony and hit that very same takedown but unsuccessfully on his opponent. Kim. Yeah. And grappling match right after that I think is going to go to light heavyweight. John is so big for light heavyweight man. He's so fucking physically talented too. What is it? It's a, it's a fake single and then you kind of like duck under the clinch. Yup. Is that what that was? And the way John did it was just, it was so glorious. We watch how quickly he covered ground. You realize like how fucking talented he is. I don't even think it's up on the Internet either.

Speaker 2:          02:39:01       I think it is. You can watch it and go watch. You could watch the uh, the take down and you can watch the finish. I don't think you watched the whole fight and now are they going to do John Verse jail now because John got on the mic. I was like, yeah, I want to fight you chill. And I think they are going to probably do something like a tail will go in there and get smooshed for the hx. John is just too big and too good. He's so talented, man. He's winning Jujitsu tournaments like as a goof. He stepping into them and and grapple with people and strangling. Go with like a gary tone tonin with they'll re, yeah. Let me tell you something man. What John said when he was on my podcast goes, I fell in love with Jujitsu because I'm obsessed with it.

Speaker 2:          02:39:43       He goes, I'm training all the time. He goes, no, I'm not going to be standing in front of people trade anymore. He goes, fuck that. He's like, I wouldn't be taking people down, choking the shit out of him. He said, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was hilarious. It was like just he, he's so talented as a grappler, you can do whatever you like. It's on some other planet. It was a nice pass to, he took them down and then it was a nice pass. That arm triangle was John Jones might be pulling guard on people, an arm bar. He Guardian Daniel, come on Daniel after he was beaten him up, but he, he might be pulling guard on people, an arm bar on him in the future. He's also a guy who, who could do and even to a bay level, beat the light heavyweight champion heavyweight champ.

Speaker 2:          02:40:20       And he could do that. You can get so much more notoriety than connor could it like dobby absolute as well. Maybe he might do we look Humana? There's, you occasionally get a guy that's just so incredibly talented. You Go, well, it's really all about focus. It's about foot. Like if you watch him, watch him, you've seen it. The Dan Henderson match. But Dan Henderson's totally undersize is not, they're not nearly in the same way class, but it's really not going all out. He was busy, but it's effortless. I mean, you, you watch how he does, he like, what do you mean Dan Henderson was going light? I just think Dan was nice match. It was competition. Watch this here. Here it goes. Because this is a suspended UFC fighter. Jon Jones, what does it say? Fought Dan Henderson at underground event and uh, John started off on his knees and just crawled forward and he see Dan like putting his hand on his head and John [inaudible] John is like, he's like unstoppable.

Speaker 2:          02:41:17       The waste closing in on so strong. He's, what I'm saying is like the ways moving in on them, it's almost like unavoidable. It's like this is going to be a mauling, you know this is not going to be like what he did with jail sign and when he grabbed shale and took them down and just slammed on the ground. So their size and compete with John. Like look at the guys that have given him issues like Gustafson, he says same size. Those are the only time he really has issued. He toward gave him some issues. [inaudible] hard bar I think got dealt with. He submitted veto us. He did. Yes he did. But when Vito caught him in that arm bar, that was like really the first time we'd seen him ever in trouble inside the ox human they think, yeah, I'll get out of here. This is mostly John just pushing them up against the cage and they let him go. Oh, he threw a jab at him. What the fuck is that about? We didn't really throw a jab like he pretended he was going to do a spinning elbow. Oh, he's just clowning around. I think rockhold wants to do it to Jon Jones was rockhold. That's right. Rockhold did say that. Let's see the tape. Well how long did the match go?

Speaker 2:          02:42:18       I don't remember, but it did take down was the ridiculous thing. I'll see if you could find that in there. See now this is worth it, Eddie, just to make money

Speaker 2:          02:42:27       cause you're not no head trauma if you lose it's whatever. Oh yeah, for sure. This is a totally different thing. I really wished that this pay, there it is. Woo Boom, gets him down and riding side control. I really wished that this was a viable option in terms of like financial success. I really wished that there was a a way, I think, I think your event has the best chance of doing it. I really do. I think if your event, when people watch it and get behind it has a real possibility because it's fucking exciting as shit and people will pay money to see it. Especially when line at Vegas. Caliber of these guys are doing and flying to Vegas tomorrow, meeting with a UFC fight pass. They want to, they got great numbers. Ebi 10 they said the numbers were staggering and they want us to get behind and go crazy. It's the

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       best thing about Eddie. Look at this. This is totally possible. You could be the Don King of chokes. Oh look at this. Let me get this top fucking jokes. Look at this. Just you and Eddie. You were saying that you are, oftentimes we'll stay in the mountain that you don't three quarter mount butter amount. You stayed. Do you ever say in full amount? Full amount to only because the rise of leg lockers, deadly leg, leg, leg lockers that hit a leg lock transition when they're mounted, so if you let them get their hips up. I always stay in three core. I don't even, the only time I'm doing a full amount is if I'm in sky dive, if I got my hips down and my ankles crossed and then I'm hunting for an under hook, but I'll never just sit there and regular amount because everybody now has, has got that mount escape to leg locks that you got.

Speaker 3:          02:43:56       It could just turn everything around. It could be over. So Sean, the hips and get soaked. Also those ridiculously flexible guys that get those legs and play like Eddie's dexterity, your dexterity. It's always been my main escape too is using my flexibility when someone mounts it. Right. And that takes me into leg locks and at that used to be the only he'll hook. I had in my game was off being mounted and then I would use a hail Mary escape, see cups in the armpits, cross my feet in front of her stomach, over hook a leg and then take them right to just good old fashion outside. He'll hook that. Uh, that was my number one escape and that's just too dangerous now, not now. Guys have taken that escape and added a thousand more leg lock transitions off it and at that I actually had a guy come to my gym maybe four or five years ago for a purple belt from Hen Zos and he was super flex by walk onto the Mat and he sitting there walking to class, he's got both legs behind his head.

Speaker 3:          02:44:50       I don't know who this guy is. He said, he said, Oh, I'm at, so I'm like, how you doing? He's just like looking at me. He just wanted, he wanted to show me how flexible, it was way more flexible than I am, way more. I can't cross my feet behind my head and we rolled and I mounted him quite easily, but I didn't know it was a trick. He let me mount them and then its flexibility and I was low, I was super low, but he would grab his feet and just put it in the little crack and inch by inch you with a stick his foot in B, I'm laying flat on him and then he would get through, boom, right into a leg lock and he tapped me. I'm like, Holy Shit. So we went again and I mounted him again. I said, I shared amount of them.

Speaker 3:          02:45:25       You know, there's some guys like you just don't fucking mouth these guys. You take him to the truck. So I mounted him and I was super tight, just clinching time and he just grabbed his foot and just put it right there. Just would hold it right in the, in between our rib cages and he couldn't get in initially, but inch pan she would just get, he would just pull this flynn, it was like he was jail breaking, uh, uh, uh, to that mount escape. Wow. That's just crazy. You got tapped me again and I thought from that point on I go, hmm, I can ever, uh, uh, I can't, I always got to make sure that I roll with people and assume everyone can do that, doesn't and have that kind of ridiculous flexibility, dexterity. You gotta assume everyone's that

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       good. So at that point, it altered my mouth a lot. Like with the arm triangles, I just stay in the mount. So you just assume you have to assume that everybody's at the death level. That why not? Because if it works on them that it works on everybody. To me up with it. What was crazy when Eddie and I were doing that on an invitational thing, they were telling us that there's like 14 year olds mto tour homeschooled just to be dedicated to Jujitsu. No, those nine year old real, those nine year olds. I was like, what the fuck is going on? Yeah. Two nine year olds doing ankle locks. Fucking all your shit. You know what we were talking before the podcast started, we were talking about physical freaks like that big gorilla Shane car. When and how when, uh, I watched Jane Carlin role with people.

Speaker 2:          02:46:51       It's like, what is the point of this? This is preposterous. Shankar Shankar. We walked into a mall Easton's Jujitsu gym and I didn't know who he was for a second. I'm obviously, I knew who he was. I'd commentated his fights, but for a second I looked up from the mat and I saw him walk in and my tests on a person that's a gorilla. That's some shaved shuttle out from the ECZEMA. Yeah. It doesn't even look like a real human and he would roll with people and it would be preposterous. It's a waste of your time. I remember I trained because Jane would have had another job and he'd have an injury. So you'd gone for like four months, not train Jujitsu twice a day. So, so I'm, I can't wait cause he's like a big brother and I can't wait till I get to know more role this full up.

Speaker 2:          02:47:28       He would come in off his nine to five, set his lunchbox down, put on his fucking weird shit. Basketball shorts, baggy tee shirt. I'm like, you've been rolling. I'm like, yeah man, let's go and you just fucking destroy me. I'm like, dude, why don't you do more Jitsu? Like why I can, I'm just fucking gorilla. Strongest as strong. But wouldn't you love to see a guy like him fall in love with it? And then when the Monday owls, like how crazy would that be? How crazy would it be to watch Shane car when, when Abu Dhabi with his wrestling background, if he won, if he dedicated, dedicated himself to submissions, like just pure submissions. Like what a freak athlete is. Months and choke, you know, cause he's bigger than months and he would pop your head off. It took out it, you know what the problem is though, man.

Speaker 2:          02:48:13       He's got just that PR posture, his punching power and he's like, why would I not have my best thing? Yeah. Like his punching power was just ridiculous. It's too much work. Why don't I just jam that guy in the face and attending nef dog. I mean it's gotta be, it's gotta feel way better to knock someone out to drop someone than to tap him out. Go into Shane Carwyn Kaos Frank Mir, cause that was one of the darkest one frank mirs corner. They're gone. They're gone. A chill frank rounds almost over. Just chill and it pishing off. He looks at the corner and it just fucking ends. Frank made it right there. That's what he does. His is going, you're good, fine frank. Just let him get the under hook. Don't give him head control. You're just chill. It's almost the end. The round. Then shame. It's like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          02:48:59       I can knock the dude up. I need this much space. Yeah. Douche came over. They were ridiculous. Uppercuts, just horrific dishes that he's, he's an interesting example of mayor wants to do Ebi. I know he does. Yeah, it's great idea. He'd be like, he's an awesome, awesome as mission Fabi Silver Dome as well. Wants to do combat Jujitsu, the combat Jujitsu version of Eba, which is going to be the next show. Ebi Eleven's gonna have a regular 16 man, uh, regular Ebi rules, welter weights, and within it a four man combat duty in March. We nailed down the date tomorrow. Let me know when it comes up. There's going to be Jujitsu, Jujitsu with pumps, right. Would come and I would go to it and catch it with you. No, no, no. Slap. He moved, but not slap the slap part. But you know, if you've ever thought about competing in Jiu Jitsu part, uh, he's been too busy with podcast.

Speaker 2:          02:49:54       I'm too busy with podcast shows and stuff. Comedy, you know, family gun standups hard enough. You know like it's so challenging man. I appreciate that. But you know when you did have that grappling match and metamorris a Cyborg and everybody got mad at you and you understand why everybody got mad at you [inaudible] percent, you'd be even more mad if you know how much money I meant you did engage him. He did engage him and engage him on the ground. You gave Cyborg chances and he couldn't do shit with you. And I watched it. I was like, wow, like I understand you being cautious because you have to fight in the UFC and you didn't want to get your legs torn up. Cause cyborgs. That tornado guard is and he's a ridiculously strong dude. Ridiculous. He's a bad motherfucker. I mean Cyborg is a killer. And but you did, you did an all Phi as a tax.

Speaker 2:          02:50:33       I mean I understand that you went pretty straight defense but it did work. You know, it's interesting cause he, he was engaging with you. You work locked up with him in the garden. He wasn't able to do anything with you. I was like, hmm, I wonder how you would do if you like really dedicated yourself like an competed in some sort of an event. Like you want the truth. I just don't care. That's all you need to say. Too busy with other things like that. That part, that part of my life, like I love watching this thing and I love commentating on it, but to dead cause you really got to dedicate to keep it. You know how it is. You really got to dedicate and be all in. Like all Cyborg is doing is shooting Jujitsu seminars and videos and rolling every day when you just don't care when you put metreon and asleep.

Speaker 2:          02:51:11       I remember thinking like, who's got a fucking serious doris? Like you have a serious Doris when you clamp that thing out on a mitre. And I was like, Ooh, ow, Ooh, this is, and then he was out and I was like, that's a serious fucking darce choke. Yeah. That was my shit, man. I love, I love Jujitsu, but it's just, yeah, it's not, and I'm not in that lane anymore. It's not like the, there's not big money in submission only or I should be fun. Maybe you know, for the winter, the winter has pretty good money. I mean Gary Turner is made thousands and thousands of dollars and Eddie Cummings and the $100,000 this year. They're making money if you win. But um, overall, you know, you, um, there's right now there's no money for it, but still still the guys that are in it, the guys at the top there training fool on the fucking all the time. I feel like your event, has it changed your, your event has

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       the, the, the possibility to change that. I really do. You've got the event. I really did it. Hopefully, you know, Ebi 10 was pretty fucking Damn Chris. So crazy to watch man. And you got little girls competing, which is amazing to watch girls that are like, how old are the youngest girls? You there? The UFC didn't want to have any of that anymore. So really I'm no more minors, no more, no more. Uh, under age two, man, was that because of the girl that got, he'll hooked in her leg, possibly soul snaps. Rob Her heel. The snap. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. She had her acl blowout. I love children do Jujitsu. F that's the cutest shit. It's more to my glove. It shows you where the sports APP conundrum. Come on. Grace got drunk. She is really amazing. Who's Oak? What's her name? Cora Hora sac.

Speaker 3:          02:52:54       Have you seen this Korean girl? She had the big old check. Why isn't it possible to maybe have a youth version of the same thing and to have like just call it something else and don't do it on bypass? That is possible. It seems like there might be an option to do other stuff as well. I mean, unless you have some sort of exclusive thing, which I don't want to grow it. I, I really liked that pop one. Or do you want to give kids the chance to compete? He had people loved watching grace. People loved it. That was my favorite. She got bigger roars than anybody. Oh yeah man. Tremendous roars. People fucking love watching grace. But you know, there's other shows she just, she's going to do, um, show the arc finishers, which is a sub only show Ebi rules on the East Coast. She's going to do that and she's got a big fight.

Speaker 3:          02:53:37       It's like a super fight coming up. Cora just fought in the honored and the table. So there's these other, uh, uh, submission only tournaments out there using ebi rules when they have a platform. And, you know, the UFC did, I didn't even want to fight them on it, you know, they like, okay, no minors, no minors, no big deal, you know, uh, uh, eventually we'll, we'll see the return of grace eventually, eventually can imagine, you know, three or four years later and when she's 18 and we bring her back and that's going to be crazy. It's going to be like the guns and roses were union. Yeah. Jujitsu. Interesting. It's just interesting to see it because I think it's a, it's the safer alternative for the athletes, especially athletes. They really just want to develop the Jiu Jitsu skills. You can get immersed in Jujitsu. They don't want to have to, in order to be a professional, have to compete as an MMA fighter.

Speaker 3:          02:54:25       Yeah. Well, competition is so high at Uga in Jujitsu, right? Oh yeah. And so far, every Jujitsu event has failed. They've all failed. All of them. Uh, and Ebi, you know, we're not out of the woods. There's no big giant pile of money. No one's making money except for the winters. You know, we're just, it's a passion project. 100%. And who knows, maybe we don't survive. But apparently we got really good reviews at the UFC fight pass for Ebi 10, which you could still watch right now. You watch the replay was amazing. I watch and Geo Martinez and Eddie Cummings go out at that. That was one of the most epic Jujitsu matches of all time. If you guys don't survive, everyone's fun, everyone's fine. We're going to try it. You know,

Speaker 6:          02:55:03       we're going to do our best. Yeah. You Guy know you'd being humble and everything like that, but, and I don't, I, you just never know. No, no events have made it so far. No, that's the main, any markers. The rule sucked ass. Go back to the card. Good. See if [inaudible] is there any fights that we missed on this UFC card? I don't know how there's all these ready. Don't worry about that. No, no, no. You've got the perfect rule set. Let's go back to this just to see if there's anything else that Hendrix, oh, that's right. That's right. That's what I wanted to talk about, dude. You know, you got to wonder where Johnny Hendricks head is at. When you heard the way he trained for his last fight. You know, he was saying that he was the only training like a few days a week and it wasn't really that steak house.

Speaker 6:          02:55:42       It wasn't really trained in every day and that his wife really got them geared up to, to train for this fight. But the problem with that is like Neil Magnese's, I don't fucking roll man. I mean, he's had some tough fights and some good fights and he beat hector mother fucking Lombard by stoppage, you know? That's right. He'd be any beat Kelvin. And he beat Lombard when Lombard was putting it to them in the first round was really close fights where it was like, man, this might get stopped. And Damien Maia eight his ass for lunch. Like coby has issued the way Damien Maia put that smushed down on him. I was like, whilst a bad matchup stud, next level Jujitsu batch, Damien Monster, this thing. Very interesting. First of all, you got to get a hold of Woodley. Second of all, you've got to get him to the ground.

Speaker 6:          02:56:28       Good luck with both of those things. Yeah, good luck. Both of those fucking hammered into another dementia. It's a fun, fun, fun to Whitley and Woodley's showed him that wonderboy fight that he can hammer you went to a dimension in the fourth round, correct. He could still like deep into the fucking championship rounds, can still hammering you out of this fucking zone flag for money. We'll tell you what Jujitsu might make Woodley a little cautious. 100 [inaudible] probably not gonna throw any leg kicks or anything, but try to knock his ass out, but we don't. You think that Woodley's wrestling and his physical size and strength and he's taking Breslin bubbly, strong [inaudible] no taken down restaurant. The rest of the juicy when Damien Maia took down chill Sonin people forget that it the man with the inverted triangle, the mount that lateral dropped double over Hook laterals dropped him.

Speaker 6:          02:57:18       Yeah. Yeah. It's vintage Damien mind. Yeah. He got ahold of them and uh, those is frank Mir versus car went. This is horrific. No. Oh, okay. Don't worry about it. That game. Yeah. It's probably only on fight pass. If you go to UFC fight pass and we have a account or is it just my account? Is it on? Yeah, we don't have to see it. But anyway, it was a Merch gigging marketing. What we were talking about the difference between a guy who's like a super tactical, really high level guy and then there's a point of diminishing returns where it doesn't work on somebody and that's the point of shame. Carwyn like you should like, like almost like, there's like a physical limit of almost all technique that you hit a wall when someone gets just so stupid strong that they can, as long

Speaker 2:          02:58:02       as he's skilled and he is skilled on top of that, he's aware of what's going on. He's like a Rashad Evans blackbelt like Rashad, it's not going to submit you off his back. But his knowledge and his defense is insane. There's just different, you know, like he doesn't have what's going on with Rashad. Like what happened after that? Tim Kennedy fight, they pulled them out of the Tim Kennedy fight. They pulled him out and then he was supposed to fight again. Right. Pull them out again. I don't know. He tried to fight Kennedy again, but this time in Toronto and Toronto pulled them out too. I know. So New York City pulled them out and then Toronto pulled them out and uh, he says it's a preexisting condition. He said he's something he's always had, but who knows, man, I don't want to hear that. What do you think about that Kevin?

Speaker 2:          02:58:37       Gasol them fight Jesus. Right. Okay. No, no, no. But against a Tim Kennedy, first of all. Oh yeah. That's another example of a guy who wasn't cutting any weight and look fucking amazing. But then he wants to go back and talk to your boy. Why is you want to go back down to 70 because those guys have to cut weight. Those guys are cutting weight and getting down to one 85 and they're gigantic guys like Hector Lombard and he doesn't want to have to fight one of those guys. Okay, but you gotta make weight a seventies I understand what you're saying. And I think there's a middle ground there. I think seven days to harvest made one 70 many times. It's missed it the last time. But this last time he says he was on the new dieticians a regimen and it didn't work out. Didn't work out.

Speaker 2:          02:59:19       You have dolce originally? Yes, I think so. Did you just not want to pay the money? I don't know exactly what went down between that. He's just gotta be personally more disciplined if he's just personally more discipline with his dye. It's on him. Yeah. It doesn't matter. The dietitian, you know, especially him cutting weight and how he's been doing for so long, you know, commodity. Let me ask you this. The fucking handle moves and shit make, he'll accept 85, I think one. That's what I'm saying. I think he's fine there, but he's fighting veit doorbell. Four nights that he's going to buy. You Tore Belford 85. Yo Dude, that's a, that's a rumble. Yeah, it seems Brazil. Oh, what does that mean exactly? What are you trying to start his coach? You don't know. What does that mean? You throw in Brazil is a different animal for sure.

Speaker 2:          03:00:01       Why isn't there no, you cited there. What are you trying to say? What are you trying to save? Show, say anything. What I'm saying? There's something that I say he down there. This is the last chance for romance for Vituro too. It's a great, it's the perfect fight for Canelo saucy, perfect fight name. Put the mits to him. Musashi, put them into v Tour and I think Kelvin is a better mover then Musashi Musashi has more weapons, like loose aussies are way better kicker. Uh, but what Calvin does, man with his footwork and that like real light on his feet, moving in with that Right Man Jab Rafael Cordeiro has got, I mean his, his, his striking look, super professional, so good and, and ridiculous combinations and speed and fluidity. That's what keeps going forward. Keeps going, keeps going forward. So game, gas, shame game. It's gas tanks retarded. It's just so good. He's so strong. Fear Zero fear, Great Chin. Who's demeanors and saying yes and you know, was real comfortable when tim was mauling him. Like Tim got ahold of him early in that first round and really

Speaker 6:          03:01:00       put out a lot of effort that seatbelt got his back. Really was mauling him with size and power. But Tim gas himself out doing that. Tim Look terrible in that flight. Did I love Tim more than anyone in this world? Tim, what about me? You love him more than me. It's a tossup. He'd be fighting for my freedom from my fridge. I'm still interesting. But uh, tim looked rough in that fight. It was a terrible performance for him, but him, nobody fucking handled themselves better after loss. Then that guy, what did he say? Fucking owns up to it. The guy kicked my ass. He's a better fighter than me. It was very embarrassing. Picture him going to the hospital at well that sucked. Yeah. Eyes face. Totally jacked tip Kennedy took a picture of herself jacked in the hospital. I think I s uh, outlook on on losses, losses or ou.

Speaker 6:          03:01:46       When you're in someone's corner and you're dealing with someone, man, it's like, it's hard. It's hard to, all you can say is like there's nothing that says you can't win them all, bro. You got caught. Anybody can get cut. But there's a difference between like what we were saying, like a guy like Tim Kennedy took that loss and like how hard Rhonda took her loss to Holly Holm. Yeah, there's a, you know, a giant difference. Complete opposite. And that's the business of being a fighter. This game's easy when your merch in everyone, everyone's every media outlets telling me how good you are. Like yeah, this is fucking great. Then you take one on the chin, you lose. Most fighters come back and go, all right, I got merch. But watch this fight. You'll see what's up. I'm a real fighter. That's why tim or you eat Kelvin's had his loss.

Speaker 6:          03:02:26       Is everyone that many. Then Connor, you know he came back, he was already talking shit after that fight. He was like in a fuckhead. I fucked up, but I'll be back. Took it like a man and didn't talk about a staph infection. By the way, a lot of people, when we found out about us sat staph infection because of my fucking big mouth, but he had a staph infection two weeks out of that first nate diaz fight. He was taking antibiotics. That's the word might be. I don't think it's bullshit. I haven't heard it directly from his mouth, but I heard it from a very reliable sources. Do you hear what his camp is doing? What are they doing? His coach is requiring every fight on his team to have their brain scan. Fuck yeah, John Kavanagh. Fuck yeah. Right. Powerful move. Smart Guy, man. Fuck yeah.

Speaker 6:          03:03:04       This is a crazy sport. You know, and no one wants to tell people when they can and can't do it, but someone should be watching out for them because that fucking same ego that makes you want to be a champion can also get you real confused as to when you are physically compromised, which brings us to the fight that was pulled off this card, Cain Velasquez versus fabrizio for doom. The rematch, which everybody was looking forward to and a cane did that meeting with that, uh, that, whatever that meant. A association. Yes. The Fighters Association and said that he's going to have to have a surgery after this fight. And they went, what? Why don't you step that he fucked up you. They like, you can't say you need a surgery before you have a major fight. First of all, that that's going to fuck with the betting lines.

Speaker 6:          03:03:50       There's a disaster there that's going to fuck with the insurance if something happens to you. And then afterwards they say, Oh, you know, you, you told us that you are already hurt. We're not paying for this. Like do you, do you get paid? Um, for like when you're in training camp and you get to a fight and you have to pull out because the injury, you don't get nothing. Right? What do you get? Uh, nothing. Nothing. So you've got nothing. So if he chose to fight with that injury, he said he was gonna be 100%. He's going to have a cortisone injection. And the doctors disagree. The Nevada State Athletic Commission disagreed that uh, Bob Bennett Guy, he doesn't fucking play any games, man. He's like, you can't say something like that. And then finally long to do that. I fucked up. He fucked up emotional when I called Linacre a little monkey earlier.

Speaker 6:          03:04:33       I fucked up. See came fucked up. You just talk, you say things, you know, I was going to say, well that's kind of racist, but I call myself a monkey though. I just, it sounds sounds worse than it really is. It's not racist. It's not the last person racist. But the point is with when it comes to Cain is that it was a giant error and that error pulled him off of this card and now he's going to have to fight. He's going to have to get surgery and then he'd have to fight whoever the fuck has left and it's, you're talking about more months out and then even more examination next time and it's going to cost him a shit load of money. A ton of money went through the entire camp. He was a week out and they pull them from it. And then he was saying, I don't know what this is about.

Speaker 6:          03:05:09       I'm, I'm 100% good to go. I've been told I've been cleared. So he was tweeting that he had been told that he was cleared right before they pull them. I thought, you know, I think you give the guy a physical examination in terms of his movement. Like what can you do? Like, how do you, how do you tell a guy business wise, business wise, you can look in his bag back some since I ask the as you can't cause the UFC goes man, you have a bulging disk, you can of course on the shot and then if you get punched in the face by doing where he gets a guilty and you're paralyzed, you assumed the fuck out us cause we let your true business, you just can't do that. No deny. I don't think it falls on. Kay came knows better. The people around this association shouldn't have let them do that.

Speaker 6:          03:05:47       Well first of all they should have known about first the bjorn revenue thing is very weird. Like I was reading what John Fitch had written that John Fitch rather than an interview said that he was very disturbed by all this because there's a class action lawsuit. And what they're saying is that if the class action lawsuit is dropped like that they could form this, uh, this union. And if they all agreed to abandon the class action lawsuit, it would, it would like help the strength and form the union. And John Fitch was like, what? Like, so you're saying that the UFC would accept you as a union if you abandoned the class action lawsuit that we'd been chasing down for two years now without picking any sides. Like if you're on the side of the fighters, not picking any sides, you just have to look at that and go, well what benefit would it be for the people that are not in this to accept that the class action lawsuit is dropped? This all sounds like someone's trying to get some money because there's no one's doing this for free. That's what everybody has to realize when it comes to like these agencies and there's like three different competing ones that are stepping in. Right? There's the associate, the two big ones. There's associations as the union. Yeah. Well ultimately I think we all want the same

Speaker 2:          03:06:56       thing. We all want fighters to be compensated fairly. Want them to make a lot of money because it's a short window of time and it's an awesome sport to watch. Right? Correct. So you got wonder, does this help that? Does this help them? Does it do any of these organizations? They haven't yet because if they can't even get together and organize and they're going to fight right, then no one's going to take you serious. There's three different leaders, three different ones, and they all want different things. And then you've got to wonder whose agenda's over here? Whose agenda's over here? What it has to come. It can't come from businessman, can't come from another promoter. How's it come from the fighters, the fighters. You know what I'm saying? You know, and I'm not saying current fighters because they need to fight and then they need to have someone speak for them who's been there.

Speaker 2:          03:07:38       But you can't have these business guys with other hidden agendas trying to get things done. Or, or in a b, orange case, he has this weird jealousy with Dana and let's see them destroyed. Well, we can't have that. Why are you speaking for us? What are you doing? You don't have the respect of the fighters. What the fuck are you doing? And notice he's taking a seat back because everyone, when everyone saw him speaking, they were like, we're out man. Like he was going old school bell tour when he was running things over there and a King Mo was pissed off at him and King Mo most of this day calls him a Dick Rider all the time. It's not good when you've got a guy like king mo who's a very respected guy who has horrible things to say about you. And I talked to association.

Speaker 2:          03:08:17       I went, what are you guys doing? Like, yeah, you have one way to make an impression and you do this. You put your best foot forward with this guy. And they're like, well, I don't know the dude. Do you know him? I know of fighters who have dealt with them. I never thought for Bella tour. So I know inside the fighter circle that people have dealt with them for managing and stuff like that. But I him personally, I was looking at all the tweets and all the negative stuff. I think you can take a very positive angle about improving the life and the conditions of these fighters without attacking people. Yeah, there's no, there's no reason to attack. And it's also see what you want about Dana White. It's not his job to make sure you guys get your shit together and formed the association. He's like, I'm a businessman.

Speaker 2:          03:08:56       I put on fights. If you guys want to do that, cool. Get your shit together and then bring it and then let's figure something out. But if you guys are fighting with each other, you don't even acknowledge, you know what else is interesting about this, uh, the $4 billion that you know, is that they had to pay to buy the EOC and there's a lot of debt. I wonder how, how do you, I don't understand business. I'm, I'm a dummy. I don't, I don't have any business background, but how much money do you have to make to pay off $4 billion? Like if you buy a house and your house is like 3 million bucks, like damn, we like doing, get some daunting 30 year payments. Now imagine a thousand times that plus a billion because that's what it is, but thousand million billion is, and that's why they're going and doing these budget cuts saying, how can we save money here and how can we grow it?

Speaker 2:          03:09:45       So then you see all of a sudden you see the women 140 pound division, you're seeing these into 45, one 45. You've seen these interim belts. You're seeing ways to, you know, make up the money. Well, that's a really sad thing about the cyborg thing because cyborgs extremely marketable at 145 pounds. And they make the decision for her. Yeah. They made the division for her and not just marketable, but very controversial, very controversial, very. I mean, she's scary. She, she merck's women, she goes after them and it takes them down, destroys him, smashes people. She's in her thirties. I think she's 34, 35 cause she, that'll I think so. Pull up three 30 on June 32 31. Okay, I'm wrong. Um, so, uh, 31, it's in her prime, you know, in her prime and for her to be the champion at one 45 this she could be, she could, the problem is she's going to be an under even more screwed.

Speaker 2:          03:10:34       She's so fucking mad and there's never been someone who fucking need to pass the test so bad in their life than her because the number one knock on her was you've test pause before. That's the only reason why you're competing. That's what you're knocking people out. But fell off that train was like, no, she's so skilled. She deserves it. Put marketing dollars behind her. They're like fine, cool. Here's your division. Boom test positive but put, put yourself in or is it possible that she really did deal with some crazy weight cutting backlash where her body's just like fucked up and it's retaining water in some weird way and our hormones are all fucked up cause she got on the birth control pill. I believe that it's possible that a doctor did prescribe her this to try to mitigate that. And then the doctor told her that you could take this out of competition.

Speaker 2:          03:11:15       You can't take it into in competition because it is a diuretic, right? Yeah. So a diuretic, if you are swollen and all those things do seem to make sense. I mean, just trying to be done. I don't wanna I don't wanna see any skeptical hippo face. I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm with you on this July. No, I actually believe her story. Have you seen skeptical snake? I, yeah, I sent septal. I blew up skeptical snake. So send me that. What? I have to post this. Where did you find it? And the guy goes just for you. Shall I see you're skeptical hippo and I raise you a super skeptical snake. Yeah. This is fucking snake. I might've seen on your instagram. So skeptical. Have you seen any daddy? No. It should be. This should be your, your mascot. Whenever you watch CNN, this should pop up.

Speaker 2:          03:12:03       This is a new meme. This is a new media is fake news. So no pizza needs to be the main news site like in his fucking, oh look at you wrote, look at you rail, pull it aside. My face, when I watch a UFC promo these days, I see you're skeptical lip and raise you a super skeptical state. That's exact where for everybody at Bro, that's because they're not showing Amanda Nunes. It is kind of fucked up, but it's also, you know, like someone pointed out like when you're watching these promos, their movies now it's like this little film. It's not like training footage. People talking about it like this really slickly produced movie thing. The story is fucking great. Oh, Amanda Nunez. The story's great. Yeah. First openly gay world champion. Fricking Brazilian. I mean knock out a highlight reel, highlight reels, smack her fucking work. Like she's the devil and then, and then we, they don't show any Rhonda Kaos.

Speaker 2:          03:13:02       It's like that. Just like men in black where they just won't, he's a [inaudible] and erase that from your memory. They'll just many that, plenty of that video going around on its own. Everybody knows what happened. It's not something you needed to discuss. I think they could have done it in that video and then show him the workout to the return and it might be even more dramatic shown are crying, showing her building back up, picking up the pieces again. I mean that, that, I mean, if you wanted to go deep, you could, that's going to be in the movie, right? If you have a Rhonda Rousey life story movie that's gotta be in the movie course a hundred percent if she comes back and wins, I mean, that's exactly what you're gonna see. You're gonna see all the pain Ronda Rousey today right now. I mean, she is who she is right now.

Speaker 2:          03:13:42       What's going on right now is because what happened with Holly Holm, you know this is her comeback does, is it, can she pull off the comeback? I mean, the only reason you ain't gotta come back against who? Like I said, the average Fan's gone come back against who she has been the favorite in every fight she's ever been, had a complete blackout of Amanda Nunez. Like they haven't showed shit at all just now. There's very little footage that they're showing in these problems. They're showing Nunez. Stop watching boxing as to put it back on fucking, yeah, cause I don't see an fs one. Where on boxing that work. I'll like that. Joe tweeted them know I tweeted a big wall like while I was watching it at home, I was watching, I was actually in a hotel room. I was watching that UFC on Fox where Michelle waterson beat paige vanzant and I was watching.

Speaker 2:          03:14:26       I'm like this is so bizarre. They're not showing the champion to show in this giant Promo and it's all Rhonda. Which makes some sense because Rhonda is huge. You want to let everybody know that she's coming back, but don't you want to let everybody know that she's coming back against a killer against you want everybody to know that she's coming back to fight the champion. Joe, just just from a business aspect, what in some weird world in mma, what if Amanda Nunez Mercer in the first year she has look, no one knows it. Yes. Is one of them. One of them you see in her face, she just see her face. But like most of the pieces about Rhonda, but there's a few of these, right? There's a few different ones. Do you know? Do you know what I'm saying? Joe? What happened that she makes Ronnie there?

Speaker 2:          03:15:02       They showed, they showed her head kick somebody else's trailer, Bro. This isn't created shit. That's okay. You don't have to, it's going be a lot longer than an actual promo too. Like how long has that video right there? Those two minutes? Yeah. Do you see what I'm saying? Angela? What happens if some weird, some weird MMA world? Amanda, I heard this weird at all and then we're going, do you think that's weird? Not at all. No. It's real dangerous place is acting like they're putting all their chips in this basket where if Amanda Nunez does her thing and it happens, people go, who the fuck? Just one. But Rhonda is a thousand times more popular. Popular Than Amanda Nunez. Hundred percent a hundred percent where the money's coming from money yet, but every, okay, you've already established she runs it, but hold on. You're already the Ron is finding what you want everybody to know.

Speaker 2:          03:15:51       She's fighting a killer. Who she fighting. That's what we're tuned in in it. You will see the matchup, what selling it as if the whole thing that you're seeing is her coming back. Yeah, but I'm saying in some, in business 101 what happened if that other person wins and we don't know shit about her. You have to say channel. This is it. Yeah. There's just not much of it. You see a bunch of different, if she wins then they'll blow her up. There's still timing. We have a deadline. If she willing can fight Ronda Rousey once this one manage maybe or amy, if Rhonda gets work twice, there's no room. Who knows? But at least you know that's the girl that beat I met. She'll be just like Holly Holm, instantly huge and on, on fucking Ellyn and all that shit. Holly's in an interesting place to write cause she was instantly huge.

Speaker 2:          03:16:37       And then she loses two in a row straight. Yeah. And she loses to, to like two completely different styles. She gets choked out by Meesha against a better grappler. And then she gets a check the lot by volunteership Chenko and Mount John. Tina just, I would like to see that promo if it's possible. Jamie at the UFC, one of the on the UFC. Youtube. I know it's youtube but there's no real bro. It's not real. It's your library tube. So here's her like in the top of her feet. Your promos from arm bar people too. You get them from CNN. We all know that. Smashing people. So this is uh, is this the same one as the cartoons is a different one. This is the holly fires holly. So this is going to show it at the end of November. What happened there? They'd all show show it. They cut.

Speaker 2:          03:17:20       Oh they go black and then you see holly winning. Wow. See what she, what she likes skeptical snake. Well you got to like go down more in your face has to be done on morning planning actually. Like you see he's up, right? Cause progression of the mouse and the progression of the belt. You see the progression of the belt. But you don't see her getting head kicked. That's crazy. Why would you not show the highlight? Wow. What what you're doing is you're showing preferential treatment for one athlete without a doubt. And the idea is that the ability and the fame that she's reached you, you show preferential treatment because she's different. She's special, she's different. She's doing massive star. She has a massive star. That's the, that's the girl that's going to put this the asses in the seats right there, man. She's got busier than conor though.

Speaker 2:          03:18:05       I think you're right. But as far as women go, she is the, the corner of the timeout. The fighters. I'm talking about fighters division. It's not even close. No, not even close. There's no one like there's no one like, but just cause connor sells more tickets doesn't mean she's, they have multiple stores, multiple elite stars. And here you see Amanda doing some workouts just lifting some weights or girlfriend's a straw weight in the UFC. Is She? Yeah. World Bantamweight champion. Amanda Nunez. And then you see some highlights. So this one is showing more. So this is a different one than the one. The one that they see on tv where they roll up the garage door and you see her hitting the pads pop up and that's it. Up. Up, up. Yeah. By, by Matt please. Good though. It looks good doing that. Very interesting man. Who the fuck knows who the fuck knows? I just know you're going to be watching. Everyone's going to be watching. Yeah. That's going to be crazy man. Crazy nuts going to be crazy.

Speaker 2:          03:19:02       I think it would be surprised by the ratings. You don't think anybody is watching? No, I'm not saying that somebody haters. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not a hater on the promotional game. Stan. I understand what you're saying. I don't think you're gonna see the same numbers of the conor fight or is there any other books that are coming up that we should be aware of? Any other big fights without what else is happening on the feature about Tony Khabib is that are going to have not happen. Signed. It's that you're talking about for the interim title. I mean that's not happening easily wants money, but here's my question. How the fuck do you have an interim champion that quick? What is, what's, what's going on with that? How do you, what's what sells? That's what gets people to tune in as belts. Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:19:48       And so because of the fact that you're guaranteeing will also, if you have a beep fight, conor in Russia and Habib has the belt, Jesus Christ, we need to rush and destroy. He is the Russian destroys the only one. He is it. He's on Rafi that he's a smasher. But what a big opportunity for Tony, if Tony Ferguson could steal that thunder. And if you see when Michael Johnson clipped him and hurt him, that was the first time we ever saw him. Her true. But Michael Johnson just does not have the same grappling ability of the Tony Ferguson has. No, it's a different animals. And also Tony Ferguson is a different kind of stryker too. He's, he's much more awkward in his movement is like, he's a real hard time. Get what? They're both real good. Michael Johnson's a very good striker. I mean when you knocked it knocked out dust employee that both real good.

Speaker 2:          03:20:39       But the big difference is the amount of grappling ability, Tony's grappling abilities. Did you see Tony's tweet or did he say he goes, I'm down except the fight. He goes off. So he could be be you cause could be called them out. Cause where's the fight? And Tony, Tony said, dude, you made your deal and you're making bank. I'm not scared of anyone. I just want to get paid what I'm worth, man. I'm down to take the fight. Interesting. I need to renegotiate my contract. Interesting. You know what Tony said in between round one and round two, you know he lost that first round. Rafael Design Joe's, he Atlanta took some good shots and you know we ran into the cage and you don't know exactly what's going on through his head. And he and his striking coach Anthony's like telling and some shit. And before I got to say anything, he looks at me, goes, coach, I'm going to break his leg. I'm going to kick the inside of it. You know when he started getting it. Okay, perfect. That's what I want to hear. He's like, he's such a barbarian. That's what he had to say is, I'm going to pose a monster. So she kept beating DC Khabib looking at Dana murking. That dude gone, oh, Micah Johnson going on. Give me a title shot man. Just whooping his ass. Gonna look different

Speaker 4:          03:21:45       on the ground. It'll look different on the ground is a cubby. Make no mistake about it. He's a fucking bear on the ground. The grappler, but excellent. Michael Johnson was making a lot of uh, key errors on the ground. Yeah, he was, uh, he was [inaudible] to fix with that crucifix. He was giving it to you was hurt. He was hurt. Did you see, could be versus a dose Angeles though, until just answers a legit black belt. He mauled him. He'll be mad. Not to say that again. Mocking mauled him on the ground molded me in a weird way where you watching him just smush a guy who is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. Like he's handling it like a blue belt or a purple bag costing around. Like, I think he's grappling is as good as I've ever seen inside the octagon. He might not be the same submission stylists that a Damien Maia is, but it's pure ability to control guys, take them down, grapple them and maul them.

Speaker 4:          03:22:35       Is unprecedented. Is MMA grappling. I agree. Look at this. When he gets a hold of you, it's, it's so fucking undeniable, like this kind of shit. Like he gets a hold of you at bear hugs you and just like, bitch, you're going down, you are going to the fucking ground and he holds you there and he beats the fuck out of you when he has you there. Well he's, the rusher is insane. Insane and positioning. His positioning is pressure. His strength is Damien Maia without the submissions and mortar. Yeah. Ground and pound. Damien patrol, but better take downs. Better takedowns way better. Yeah. Mine's taking everyone down is very good at one, seven very wrestlers and everything. No doubt about it. But you've got to give the edge to, they're gonna come in off and the takedowns yeah. Yeah, I think so. I give the edge normally commit off over everybody except Ben [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          03:23:22       Ben Asked her. It was like the only guy that you just go, okay, what the fuck? That's a fun fun. Oh Bet dude. Ben Asked Grin. I feel like Ben's bigger, but you know Ben is a 170 of course, but he probably could make one 55 of the fuck no, they could could beep. They do catch weight when 61 thing that [inaudible] didn't have the tone he's going to bring into this, this college wrestling. Tony is a really good rustler is going to be a lot harder to take tony down than it is dos Anjos tell he's just a different, he's a, he's like a harder mindset. He's a scary fucking dude and more athletic. Whether he wins or whether he loses. Tony is a scary fucking guy to be in there with. Very scary. Not that Dosantos isn't, but I think that Tony is like one notch scarier.

Speaker 4:          03:24:07       Remember this is dos Anjos like in his prime to prime. Honestly it was, this was before he started making his real serious run. He got molly wop tier and then Habib got injured and then they'll sign. Just came back and he also started working with nick. Curse on that was a big, a big uh, factor and his improvement cause his strength and conditioning got way better after this fight cause he realized like, Holy Shit, I can't keep this fucking vanilla beast yeti thing. His pressures, pressures can rush Russian destroyer man. There's just these Dagestan people, man. That heart, that part of the world is tough and dudes are on

Speaker 6:          03:24:44       another level when it comes to like tenacity and aggression. He's also been doing it since he's a kid. He's a world champion. You know, Sambo that end. Russians aren't regular white people. All right? We've established the same man was the American white, Russian, white dear friend. Their genetics are fucking, there's are powerful people man. And it's the, I mean you think about all the guys who came out of Russia that had been like ridiculous world champion caliber fighters like [inaudible] system to Mary memory. You have of change skin. Yes. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. He was, he remembered when he fought to get the Francisco Bueno tote is a straight fucking dosantos is hanging in there with him for a while. But we get that [inaudible] that take down. Come on son. Monsters wrestling actual beer. Yeah. When he's a little kid like the grappling a bear. Eddie pull up Igov of Chan Chan for Francisco Bueno. Kao [inaudible] will, you should throw those casting punches. You know what I'm talking about? Where we throw hammers? He would throw like Igor Volv chinch just give it a chance. Shan Skin. Do you know how to spell it? Eddie? How do you evolve? Chin Chin. [inaudible] c h a can. There it is. Just go with one of those all the chant and then write mma.

Speaker 5:          03:26:06       Nothing

Speaker 6:          03:26:07       put equally. Okay. There he is. [inaudible] versus Francisco Bueno. Francisco Bueno.

Speaker 6:          03:26:19       And in the, uh, it's one of the, like the most vicious chaos ever washed this shit. You never seen this before. [inaudible] was another guy who was like maybe five, eight, five, nine at the most and was fighting heavyweights and just, he looked like a guy who had longer arms, but they saw the ends off. Do you remember ego hit the chancellor. Is he before your time? Before I got really Yo Dude, look at that. I mean that was an early Russian destroy. Oh yeah.

I'm so sad the chains out, but I'm happy to see that he is doing it again. And I saw pictures of him with Roy at a probably cause it [inaudible] lesnar marijuana rarely. Unless we're like steamrolled him knocked him over and yeah, that was his last five years ago. 10 years ago. Long ass time. Yeah. And then he got Mirko Cro cop or smell the wall. Who is a crawling, fighting. He's fighting and rising, right. Grown is fine. Caligiuri Ooh, that's a real

A lot of strong wrestlers come out of Iran, you know, iron, sheik, his things Greco, which doesn't always translate to mma, but who's more synonymous with wrestling?

Speaker 2:          03:29:33       And I ran in the iron sheik. None. Maybe. Nobody ever did you ever see that? I gave him a ride to the airport once and video tape and put it on Youtube. I've never seen that. No shake. It's like seven parts iron, sheik and Denny loaner where we're, um, cause he, he, his manager would take 'em you'd give him 200 bucks and you could hang out with the iron sheik and his hotel and just fucking shoot the shit with them. And so Dan, he says, dude, you want to go hang out with the iron sheik? I said, fuck yes. So we went in, it turns out we were late and he needed, he was going to the airport in late. He goes, you want to, you want to just take us to the airport? And we're like, AH, fuck yeah. We got him trapped in the car, gets out mother fucker. That's him there. How old is he there? He's a pretty old guy. Holy Shit. Wow. Yeah. He, um, he came on stage with me at that pot club in Toronto. He came on stage, he was in the audience and I brought him up on stage. You're damn right. Joe Rogan knows what these toughest sport in all of Olympics, freestyle Greco.

Speaker 7:          03:30:49       If people want to shop tonight.

Speaker 2:          03:31:07       Oh fuck yeah. Everybody knows that the iron sheik is, I showed him that I named a move after him. I had my book with me and I go, look, I called the move the iron sheik. Ah, that's amazing. He's, he's hurting man. His whole body's all fucked up from all those years of pro wrestling, everything that too, but I mean, his knees are junk on. His hips are gone back, Scott. And he's like, go get fucked up man. Fuck yeah, they do, man. Nobody, I don't think people appreciate the beating those guys take on their box or schedule though. Obviously rehearsing all that stuff in reality behind the scenes. He was the baddest dude and he was a real, uh, Olympia has an Olympic gold medal and restless. So it was Kurt Angle and uh, and backstage he was the fucking man. Everybody knew that he was running the fucking show.

Speaker 2:          03:31:51       He, well, he was a definite like real wrestler. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. There's a few of those guys that get into pro wrestling. They're like Kurt Angle, but a real legitimate gold medalist and the shit went down. They fuck you up for rail? Yeah. Well it's uh, you know, like how about brock? I give this shit went down. Who's, who's beaten brock. Good luck. Good luck though. You guys came Alaska. I see. Yeah. Became cause they went to three people on the planet. But yeah, and also Kane at two 40. You know when brock is at two 65, when, when brock is not under any sort of guidelines or restrictions, he tends to be larger. That's more con about it. Yeah. Wow. Look at that. The audio audience. She Damn, he was Jack. Oh, he was super jacked back in the day and powerful mustache. Yeah, he was a thick dude.

Speaker 2:          03:32:37       He also used to use those Iranian clubs. Those look at the fucking swango other things. We'll get the fucking thighs on that dude. Jesus Christ. I mean, he's just like one thick mother. Bleaks powerful, thick ass. Powerful dude. But I'm watch, see if you could find a Irenie. I, um, um, Indian club workout. Have you seen the documentary on the iron sheik? No. There's a documentary on him and it just got released like maybe a year or two ago. He said it's awesome. They're always sad though. Like the Jake, the snake one's a bummer. See those clubs is a great, it's a great documentary. Sad though and Shit. This whole story, um, you know, it's not, you're not going to start crying and he does this, this is, these clubs meet that check this shit out. These clubs that he's using, these are like traditional Indian clubs that they used to use to, to work out.

Speaker 2:          03:33:29       They would do these things called shield casts that is fucking very hard to hell. Yeah. And the way he's doing. And he's like, yeah, yeah. Those things around like they're nothing. Those are fucking difficult to swing around. And I do that work out with a 25 pound club. It's that like, it's that hard to do now. He's a legit badness. Yeah. 25 pounds. Seems like it's nothing that like, it seems like, what the fuck is that though? That he called them Persian clubs. That's what we called it, Hershey and clubs. They, well they used him in Persia as well and uh, I ran. But the, those were uh, like an old school strength and conditioning piece of equipment and you would get other people to try to do it and they just couldn't do it. Like some of them they would do matter would, they would use like these big thick pieces of heavy wood with a handle on the bottom.

Speaker 2:          03:34:14       And that was what the originally are made out of. But now a lot of guys make them out of steel now. Like this Guy Jack White boy taking the challenge. Oh he's doing it to Paul Paul. Goddammit. Precious Paul, Precious Paul's going forward and back, which is legit. But the real way to do it is what's called a shield cast where you take your right hand and you go towards your left shoulder behind your back and then you control, you bring it down in front of you and control. Do we have any of those here? We don't have any of those. We have the macy's, but we don't have a club. It's a fucking awesome exercise for stroke. Shoulder strength. Your shoulders, beverly. Yeah, good. What you do, they can't go with like really heavy mates right off the bat, but obviously precious Poe, he's getting Jack now. Seconds later he was like, I do stupid. Fuck whoever you ellis. Chest precious pays us a man. And just knowing that that iron sheik knows I'm alive. I mean, I mean it's pretty dope. Can you still pay him $200 to chill and stuff for now? 400 bucks now. Is it 405 now? It's fine. Fuck you. Keep talking. It's going to get more. Yeah, we put him in the car for like an hour. It just picking his brain, make them leave messages.

Speaker 2:          03:35:27       He was down. He wasn't [inaudible] ride to the airport. We see live, I think somewhere in Minnesota, maybe cold out there as fuck if you got a bad hip. There's some wwe guys killing it. Like Jesse Ventura's killing it. He was a big time. He's had some injuries to man. A lot of those guys are all busted up from that dude. Jesse Ventura is like 100% wheat activists now. He just wrote a book on, I had him on. Oh Shit. Yeah, he was great. He's all about the weed movement or some shit and he uses weed for, he's got a bunch of ailments and his wife has some ailments too, you know, and she's using weed for it. You know, he sued the American stamp guy and one American sniper. Yeah. Chris Kyle. Cause calcs. Crew. Cal said he beat him up, kind of punked him in a bar.

Speaker 2:          03:36:17       And he was like, that fucking never happen. And sued him. Yeah, he's um, actually said he was going to consider running for president if Donald Trump won. That's what he said on the podcast. I wonder if he's still going to do it. Talking to her seventies now. He's in his seventies yeah. And that's, that's a hard, just Donald Trump. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. It's all very interesting, man. All okay. Any of the fights we need to talk about? Is that it? Did we get them all pulled up? Brandon Thatch. Oh, who's he fighting isn't fun a while. He's fighting up a price. Who's Nico? Nico Price. Nico. Nico Price. How's that doing your, you're friends with him, right? Yeah. Friends with him. I talked to at least or bowl and this morning about him, he said it's the cause that just thing has always been dedication. He sits the most dedicated. He's ever been to a fight.

Speaker 2:          03:37:03       So that's usually scary. Well, he's a super, super talented guy. Great. Oh, and Tim means is finding Alex Oliveira. Ooh, there's a sleeper dude. How come nobody brought that up? What else? Stunned. Done verse Safa Dean. But hold on, let's look at this fucking fight. Tammy's is a bad mother fucker and so is all of era. All the air is big though. Didn't he have a hard time making one 70 in his last fight? Yeah. W was, it was this last fight is when he got murked by cowboy. The real cowboy because he goes by cowboy to know he, I feel like he fought Alex. Right. And he won, knocked the guy out, but he was way overweight. He's huge, like way overweight. Like for some reason he, I mean, I want to say he was several pounds overweight. Right. That's a fun fight. Yeah. Garcia versus Mike pyle.

Speaker 2:          03:37:43       Mike pile still hanging in. God talked about can we, he's the dirty bird. He's a bad motherfucker to really skillful. Very smart guy when it comes to is not young and then they are cute.

Guns been up for a minute. Yup. He has in him versus terrick. Safa Dean is very interesting. When was the last time stun gun was in? When was the last time Dung Young Kim was fighting. What was his last fight? If you had to guess. It wasn't the Woodley [inaudible] woodley stopped him probably because he's taken a long, let's see what it does it say there. Is it Woodley? Nope. Last fight. He Won. Who did he fight there? Dominic water shit. Ohh. Burke.

Speaker 2:          03:38:28       Dominic waters and Josh Berkman. Okay. And then he lost to Woodley. So he's still decay owed him two years since 2015. Yeah. Hmm. John Hathaway, what happened to him? He was dealing with some injuries I think had a lot of potash. Yeah. A lot of attention and under uh, under a appreciated grappling ability for a big guy from the UK. English fellow. That's right. But he uh, he had some injuries I believe. And did he have like some sort of an allergy or something to like maybe a food allergy or something like that that he was dealing with? It's like, no, you don't see some kind of medical issue. Something that's a bummer. Yeah, man. Hard ass sport. Um, is that it? Is that it for that card? Anything else coming up that we need to talk about before we get the fuck up out this bitch?

Speaker 8:          03:39:17       Sure.

Speaker 2:          03:39:20       How many articles do you think we wrote for the MMA media today? A fake mma new site. They need to stop. They're all fake. They have a lot of fake ones. People make up shit. I walked out and it's almost like a blur. I don't remember. I said I read some shit. I'm like,

Speaker 6:          03:39:34       Oh damn. I was just talking to my friends. Oh you kidding me? I never watched that shit. All that shit though. Those videos pop up like randomly I'm watching something else and that shit pops up and I'm like, I don't want to watch that bullshit. Well, on my show I do fan questions. Like when you said this shit to Rogan, like I said that, listen, that's what that was a problem with. Like people like getting upset. It's something that people's three people say, whether you're just, we're all racing world's Darton in with shit and talking shit and we're all high and were being ridiculous. When you, when you do stuff like that, like you're going to say some shit that you probably shouldn't have said, but you can't pretend that it is anything we thought out. Like a lot of it is a completely off the cuff and if you don't like that, that's fine.

Speaker 6:          03:40:16       But if you do like it, there's only one way to do it folks. You've got to do it off the cuff like that and you gotta get a crack, some eggs. If you want to make an Omelet. It's true. We'll make some omelets [inaudible] stones all day. By the way. Brian counts not, it's not that he's not here because we don't love him. He's busy.
