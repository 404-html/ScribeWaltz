Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] to server. Ah, recording discernment. The Joe Rogan experience. I almost said it again. I will say the Joe rogan.net. Is that because I'm a fucking idiot bro. Why? Asking questions. He known me for years. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name Rogan, you will save 15% on the number one sex toy for men. And it does feel good. Doug Benson, you've never fucked one of those. I still haven't done that. I got one for Ya. It's on my bucket list. Well, I'm giving you a new one tonight. Here we go. Bitches buckle up. Doug Vance is in the house. Doctor Joe, you're on fucking deep in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:00:58       Cool.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       So, so fitting that my good friend Doug Benson is here with me today. Most rock and music of any podcasts probably. Is it the most rocking? Yeah. Every, everyone else's songs are like cute or they're just sort of like a, you know, they sound like alternative comedy would sound if it were music, alternative comedy with side of it was music. Something to nod your head off and the drive off the road into a tree. Something kind of folky, maybe poppy, but that that really wakes you up here is really rocks and it was too loud in my headphones that that boom, boom, boom. Yeah, that's just to let you know you're not supposed to be comfortable always. Sometimes the, the, the beauty that comes afterwards, you would appreciate it more because he went through those drums. That's what I'm saying, right? Yeah. You're startled and then, and then it's soothing and then it's like okay, he's not going to do that again.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       And that's Joey Diaz is here and then poor Brian and scrambling every five seconds reaching for the volume dial. Wait, we have to eventually get compression like a, the great Adam Carolla his, his setup is so, so bad ass. I had total podcasts envy. I went over to his set up and he's got like real staff. He's got a crew of people working there. There was like five, six people working in this, all this electronics and equipment and video switches and, and I'm like, wow, you sit on a couch. Yeah. Did Jesus better though? We did the couch. This is way better for, for the folks in iTunes. We used to do what we used to have this stupid fucking z Gallerie couch that I bought and I just figured, well, let's just say, make a comment about that. But the problem is the couches are only good if someone's staring opposite.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       You have, you're sitting back and relaxing and someone's on the other side of the room, but an office chair is way better. It's pretty much more supportive. Yeah. So we go back, we have a circular table now in an office chair. This is as much as we, we started out with just a laptop. So this is a big incidents. This, it's like we came to the table to do some business. He had a fucking, we're not, we're not here to just sit back and fuck around. We are here to do some business. Dr Drew. Oh my God, dude, you're shocked. You're so bad at doctor drew. It's upsetting to me because I know that he knows what he's saying is not true. I know that he, what he's saying is sensationalist nonsense that he's saying because he hopes it will either get people like me to pay attention and no, he's not. I know he's sincere about it. I think he's doing it to get ratings. He's doing it to be a certain guy. It's not what he's saying. This is what he's saying, Brian, to this fucking thing up because somebody tweeted me this today and I just sat there with my mouth open, shaking my head going, this is a, this is a nonsense argument, man. This is a stupid argument. Listen to this. This is about a bust in Florida. Real 21

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       get out, but I've jumped in pretty say to you, how dare you? How dare you think he's my friend? You'd be good to him. Okay. We're keeping drug counselor Shelley's Sprague with us for this next story. 28 Palm Beach County high school students were caught by surprise when they were arrested. In a drug sting in Florida. The nine month investigation was called Operation d minus undercover officers posed as students, befriended the kids and allegedly brought pop from them. The suspects in the case of course it need not be set, are innocent until proven guilty, but watch this.

Speaker 4:          00:03:59       Marijuana is a drug. The THC content and marijuana these days would be improved. Growing methods is much stronger than many years ago. Down to that, I want to live long enough to see you at the time when it's not necessary. We're going to keep doing it as long as we drove down this room.

Speaker 3:          00:04:23       I actually agree with these guys though. I'm always cast as the NARC. I'm not a NARC. I'm not interested in telling you about how to live their life, but I'm interested in the health of young people and this kind of thing is a good idea. Don't you think, Shelly? Hey, do I think that keeping drugs out of schools at these formative ages are important and pushing the age of exposure to college age and above, I think is important. I think that there's a lot of misinformation about pot out there. There's this weird cultural ener energy around the drug and people are unwilling to accept the fact that it's addictive. It's a different pot than it was 20 years ago. It's absolutely different. There's withdrawal syndromes, the involved with it. Um, and, and I just think people have so much misinformation. I consistently hear people undereducated about what's going on in the drug cultures of today and, and the, you know, keeping up with the bath salts, keeping up with marijuana, keeping up with all of these changes, legislation changes.

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       I mean, it's a full time job, surely. Thank you. It's always good to see here. Appreciate it. And I want to just emphasize the fact that cannabis, according to the American Society of addiction medicine, not just me and Shelly, and I see this all the time, is addictive. It's one of the more common things we treat the these days. It has a rather severe withdrawal center associated with it. And the addictive process is always the same with cannabis. It's somebody who uses just a couple times and then has this, oh my God, experiences is the greatest thing ever. And then preoccupies and uses every day thereafter, somewhere out there, months or years later, it stops working so well. They start getting irritable, paranoid, not so high anymore. They use a lot more to try to bring the high back and that's when they get into very serious trouble with the dog and switch to else like what worries me is bath salts. Tonight was a really interesting night. Please take note about the bath salts. They are out there. If you or someone you love was getting exposed to substances get help. The sad thing about Corey story is that he had, this is a treatable thing, completely treatable and he needed to be walking around in dangerous, the dangerous condition he is in. Now, I also want to say that our whole, our hopes and wishes are out there for Maria Shriver. Kill that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       What his hopes and wishes are over Maria Shriver, you whore, you whore. They get through these terrible times. You whore. Your heritage hasn't been a living hell for the last 20 years. That has a, that's horror. Like doctor drew, I love you, but you're a whore. I just have to call you out, dude. This is nonsense talk you say so he, first of all, what he's saying is that marijuana is a lot of information there and marijuana is higher today than ever. Both for, well, yes it is. It's better. Here's the real statistics. Okay. You Ready? A long time ago, back in the 1970s the THC content of the average marijuana was less than 1% it was weak ass, shitty weed, the average weed. But since Amelia, if you get some high potent shit, it's as high as 30% 14 to 30% and was back then too.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       You could find some bad motherfuckers back then they got some shit and they brought it up from South America and it'll blow your fucking socks off. That's a fact. Yeah. The WAC weed back then is weaker than the Wac we'd today the whack we today is about 5% okay. But the really strong stuff gets 30 32 34 if you've got some crazy shit. So it's slightly higher for the highest grade stuff. And the reason why is because there's a lot of scientists and botanists. Heres the point. There's no bodies. No one's dying from this extra potent weed. You know what? This extra potent weed, it's getting you higher, easier. You don't have to take two hits instead of six back then they would smoke a whole joint because the joint was made at a dog. Shit, it was terrible weed. So this is stupid, stupid argument.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Second of all, him saying that it's physically addictive and that there's withdrawal symptoms. Look, there's withdrawal symptoms from gambling, okay? And there's withdrawal symptoms from video games and there's withdrawal symptoms. Cough, coffee, coffees, way worse. That's a physical withdrawal. You, you'll shit, you're shaking if you don't get your coffee, if you don't get your weed, you're like, oh, bummer. And Him citing whatever fucking government organization that measures addictive drugs. Guess what, man? That's all. All that stuff is nonsense. There's no real studies being done on how much marijuana withdrawals affects the average person and they're not putting people through marijuana and measuring them. Here's the people that have problems with pot ready, losers. The people that problem with pot, and this was in one of my jokes is one of my, one of my cds. But it's true. If Pot fucked up your life, it's just cause pot got there first. Okay. It could've been cheeseburgers, scratch tickets, the horse races. If folks have a plant that makes you look at

Speaker 5:          00:08:55       the world in a more humble way, it makes food taste better. It makes you silly. It makes you want to love your friends more, make sex better, makes food taste better. If that fucks up your life, you are an idiot and it's that simple. And doctor Jews not doing anybody any favors and giving idiots a little bandaid for their fucking mental problems because that's what this is three of our last three presidents who all admitted to having smoked marijuana. He would, they're suggesting that they should have been arrested in high school for getting involved with it. It's really, it makes no sense is so he's right in a way that I don't like the idea of drugs in high school because kids don't know what the fuck. They're not making an educated choice and they're not making it about Ponte. They're not making it about coke.

Speaker 5:          00:09:40       They're not making it about all kinds of shit that comes our way. And a lot of fucking sometimes in high school is tough enough, man. I don't advocate you doing anything you don't feel like you're comfortable with. I did a lot of shit in high school. I smoked weed and high school. I got drunk and high school. The drunk. Has he ever gotten, nobody ever taught me how to drink. Nobody ever taught me how much she can drink. So I got super drunk with my friends, threw up in a cab and I get, why aren't we sending people undercover to stop kids from drinking in schools? Yeah, no shit man. Because it's that not more than 28 why do we leap frog to a weed which causes a lot less problems with the kid in their overall lives? Right. And who are these hormone lists bitches posing as cops that can actually pretend to be 17 and an infiltrate this school.

Speaker 5:          00:10:19       Oh, what the fuck. Meanwhile, if the kids they're infiltrating were probably too high to notice. There were 40 beards and shit and the canes people to fucking, yeah, liver spots. Why does Linda have a walker? She's full. She's only 16 and what are the symptoms that they're talking about? They send the addiction study, whatever that was. What are the addictions that movies suck? Listen, man, it's real simple. Physically. It's not the drug that addicts to you. It doesn't clean to your body. You can get mentally addicted to it, but you can get mentally ill addicted to every single thing on this earth. There's people that are addicted literally to washing their hands. You can call it obsessive compulsive disorder. I call it being addicted to his particular set of activities. And that's what it is, man. People are fucking weird. Comforts you. Yes, for what?

Speaker 5:          00:11:06       You know, whatever weird thing it is you do over and over again. It's because it's something you enjoy doing. You know, we're human beings. We don't repeat things over and over again because we hate it. Sometimes we do that. Well, you know an accident pick scabs and your movie you didn't. That's the worst smoke weed for 30 days and you're moving. Do you have any withdrawal symptoms when you're in it? Well, you know, people would argue watching the movie that I got cranky but, but you know, I think I was just basically myself cause I certainly, if something irritates me when I'm high, it's still irritating. You know, it's not like you're just suddenly this, hey, everything's fine. Poke me with a stick. I don't give a shit. I'm high. It's not, you're like, you're just, you know, your head's in another place but you're not, you're not gone. You know, like the whole thing with alcohol,

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       the way that, uh, you know, people say racist stuff after they get drunk, you know, like it's not a lot of people were getting high and then just, you know, suddenly dropping the n word in a, in a smoking circle, you know, it's a totally different vibe.

Speaker 7:          00:12:09       It's, if anything, cigarettes are the thing they should be spending the most time on. Because I fucking started smoking when I was 15 and it was easy to get fucking cigarettes. I didn't fucking buy cigarettes from some guy in the back of a fucking alley. I went to a store and not like nine out of 10 times I could buy cigarettes.

Speaker 6:          00:12:26       Yeah, I don't, I don't fault him for talking about a lot of drugs. There's a lot of drugs that are dangerous as fuck and we should talk about crystal meth all day long. You should tell people don't do it. You're going to ruin everything. It will ruin your life. We need to tell, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I've never heard doctor drew lumpin we'd with everything else like bad, like yeah, we'd and bath salts like there, like there's any connection between the, the two things like legal and but crazy. Terrible for you. Yeah. If you don't know it. Bath salts are, there's a thing and we talked about on the podcast, we were incorrect. We had to go back and correct ourselves. We thought that what they were doing was selling stuff as bath salts or you can get high with, what they're doing is it's a drug and they're just labeling it bath salts to allow people to buy it legally.

Speaker 6:          00:13:13       But they have no intention of using it for bath salts. It's like some sort of secret little loophole they figured out how to do and this drug, it's like a cousin to crystal Meth, so technically it's not illegal and there's, there's laws that they've established to try to get like close neighbors and cousins of drugs out and that's how they got rid of five Meo DMT, which was legal for the longest time. Five meo DMT, which is stronger than regular DMT somehow or another slip by. They're all encompassing psychedelic, the act of 1970 and that you could buy it online through a chemical company and get a big jar of it and shit. We should just start calling. We had candy or something. We should just give it a name of something that's legal. Herbal Salad. Speaking of verbal salad, Brian's dog ate his weed or let's call it lean cuisine.

Speaker 6:          00:13:57       That's, that's apparently that's legal to push that shit on people. How does that work? Yeah, there's the, yeah, go after these diet pills. Easy and smooth. Lose the weight with no work at all. This is a lie. You're lying, you're stealing people's money. There's nothing like that. Buying a shitload of weed and then having your dog eat it. So we need to get to get into any of it. Your dog is a mess, man. Your dog is a slide. Your dog needs to go on. Dr Drew's show for dogs for everything, for everything. For Sex, for weed. This doctor drew thing though, does, is it not? Is it driving you crazy? It's driving me crazy. Well, it's a kind of weird because I've heard Dr drew in, in his recently as a year or so, say things like, uh, he told Adam once in one of their podcasts together that he thinks that marijuana will be legalized in our lifetimes. He thinks it's inevitable. So I don't know why he would think that and then also be talking this way about it. And uh,

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       I've also heard him say that it's a alcohol is addictive to someone who already is an addict. Like they're already, they're going to be addicted to something. And so, I mean, marijuana, you said alcohol. I said, yeah, I'm saying alcoholics are, can get addicted to weed was kind of the point he was making. Oh, I see. What you said is that a, you kind of have to be in an addict to, uh, to treat we'd that way. And it could be something, it could, might as well be something else. So by saying it's addictive, it's just addictive to, there's some people that have a certain predilection, what's the word? Yeah, whatever. They, they're, they're predisposed to addiction. So it would be alcohol. It could be anything. Yeah. Yeah. They're an alcoholic who smokes too much weed or whatever. We do have a friend that, that is, uh, he, he used to do coke and all kinds of other crazy stuff and now he's like super clean and healthy.

Speaker 5:          00:15:42       And he told me he can't smoke joints. He can't. He literally can't. He said I would love to get high, but if I get high, I know it's just going to be coke and then it's going to be whatever the fuck else I can get. And before you know it, um, you know, I'm waking up at someone's house. I don't know how it got there. Right. And you can say the same thing about alcohol or anything else. They like, you have to know your limits and uh, but somehow we're allowed to decide what our limits are and alcohol. Yeah. And when we're not allowed to decide what our limits are with weed, which is way more than though not fair, which is way, way physically super Jaime, I stopped drinking for 60 days and it still was performing in clubs every night and either being not high or high and when I'm not high or high, I like a drink.

Speaker 5:          00:16:21       Right. You know what I mean? So 60 days, if not drinking was the hardest thing. Really. No way I take that back. For the sperm test, I had to not masturbate for like three or four days. So that was the hardest. That was the hardest part in 60 days in the first place. Then the second place is 60 days and Obas and third place and far, far third place was 30 days of not smoking, which was a pretty easy thing to do. I could do it again tomorrow. I'm not going to, cause I've already proved this point. I could, I could go again for 30 days very easily. Like if somebody stepped up and said, we'll give you $1 million to go 30 days, no sweat. I take it back, we'll give you $500 and a trip to Disney world, I can do it. You know, it just has to be something that I love.

Speaker 5:          00:17:04       Like, uh, you know, I'll forget to smoke weed for a day here and there. I'll just be like, oh, that's, but it's not like during the day I'm thinking about it. You know, you're like, that's the thing. You can get busy and forget to smoke. Yeah. Have withdrawal symptoms of like, shit, I need a taste. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I, you know, for most people, let's say 90 whatever percent of the population, marijuana is not physically addictive. If it is physically addictive, some small percentage of the population we need, that's a medical issue. We need to figure out what's wrong with the other person or tests have never been done because it's a schedule one narcotic, right? Yeah. So that means they can't even test test it. It's, it's the most ridiculous. We need this in this crazy

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       sell they can't get out of. Because you know, old people and TV commentators need to all just go away because young people do not care. Young guilty, do not care about weed. They don't care about gay marriage. They don't care about a lot of these issues that are being thrown around right now that young people are just, whatever these numbers should we do you want have been around since I was a baby, when I was a child. I was 11 years old. My family moved from San Francisco to Florida and when we lived at San Francisco came, people were everywhere. San Francisco, this squeak weekend with Cobb's comedy club, but Sam [inaudible], Sam Tripoli and Tom Segura Thompson era. It's tickets are almost sold out anyway. Um, when, when we were in San Francisco, we tried to work one of those in later. Just shove it in there, bro. And AAA is an awesome, I mean, rather San Francisco.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       I enjoy the shit out of San Francisco when I lived there. And a triple. He's an awesome guy too, but that's beside that. That's a great center on a wrong path. I lived next to some gay people and they were cool as fuck and they used to get naked with my aunt. She used to go over, they would play bongos together. I've told the story and they would smoke weed and so gay people to me, you have a drink. Gave people to me were just like, this guy is black. This guy's giving me, this guy is from Guatemala. This guy is Chinese. It's just a different, why do you have to blacks and Guatemalans and Chinese like that, dude, I did and I pumped them up. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's all the same. It's one that says that's what young people think that you know, the young people are really in the melting pot because every kid is half this and half of that these days.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       You know his parents though, there's more and more of all the ethnicities. It's growing, you know? Yeah. This country is really going to change drastically. But this argument of them being able to be married, it's been going on forever. When I was 11 we had moved from San Francisco to Florida and I was hanging out with my friend, candy Esposito. Candy was a Cuban kid and his dad was yelling and throwing the paper down and we walked in the room and I was like, fuck, what happened? You know, and this guy's mad. Some shit must have went down. And so someone says what happened? And he goes, fucking fags, want to get married. He believed this shit and he's holding up a newspaper. And I'm like, wow. And I'm 11 and I'm looking at this guy, I'm going, I don't believe this mother Fucker's a dad.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       And I was thinking like, thank God you know this, this asshole isn't guiding me in life. He's sitting here getting angry and throwing his newspaper down like a fool because some gay guys want to get married. So that was like fucking, I was 11 I'm 43 do the math. That's a long ass time ago and it's still going on. Hang on. I need a pen and paper. I have to do the math 40 32 but you won't have to do any math at my show on Sunday at flappers in Burbank, California for 20 in the afternoon show. And if you're doing, if you're after and you're going out of town, right? Yeah. What Day is this? This Sunday? Sunday. Sunday. I might be back not doing Sunday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and I fly back. I might do that. I might go to your show that often because I have to. Yeah, I might do that. I flying in at like 9:00 AM so yeah, it's, you know, it's my interruption podcast. Oh, you're doing a podcast.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       But we did a comic out and we just basically fuck around for a few minutes, read some tweets and talk about stuff. I mean it's like basically what we're doing right now, but with an audience, I don't, I don't really heckle you as much as you just, you know, just fuck around together. Yeah. Yeah. It's like an interview, but you're standing and I'm sitting and flappers is perfect. Been awesome menu. Their food there is so delicious. So if you go there, study the thing I'm trying to, I've been trying to tell them as they're going to sell a lot of food that that afternoon they should batten the hatches or you know, whatever expression you should tired their lines at what point in time, just the four 20 thing become hacky. Does it get to a certain point? We, you know, when you see a dude's cross screen name on your message board, it's Doug for 20.

Speaker 5:          00:21:28       Oh, that guy's probably an idiot. It's like if you've got a girls' email address and her an email addresses, you know, whatever, you know, uh, you know, Barbara 69, that girl's a slut, you know what I'm saying? Or at least that's certainly the impression she wants to give off. She wants to let you know there's that action. People are proud of smoking thought I, I'm proud of it too, but I've never, I've never really tried to put it front and center. You know, it sort of became that. We tried to put it for you did the marijuana logs? No. I mean, but the jokes were like, you know, they weren't, it wasn't like a OneNote show. We went off in lots of different directions. Got To say that you put marijuana pretty front and center though dude. And it's a good thing in terms of that.

Speaker 5:          00:22:11       Yeah, I wrote a play a play about it with two other dudes, but like we just all just happen to have pot jokes in our acts and then we're like let's just pull them together. So we did, we wrote a little bit of extra material but I'm just saying that like pot jokes, I've always been in my act just cause then I'm honest about it and it's part of my life. So that's why it was there and then people liked it. So then you know, you obviously talk more about the things that people want to hear about. It's a thing where people who don't smoke pot get upset at people that smoke a lot of pot and talk a lot about it all the time. They get upset. I know lots of people don't find it to be interesting conversation. And the reason we like it is because we're high.

Speaker 5:          00:22:47       You know. So I, I've had that problem with people out on the road. He said I'm a different, I'm on a different level than they are for my enthusiasm for talking about weed. Cause obviously I already have to talk about it a lot. So somebody comes up to me and they want to talk about movies or something. I'm kind of excited because everybody just wants to say, what's your favorite strain? You know, have you ever been to Amsterdam? And that Shit's fun to talk about. But it's like, you know, just gets repetitive and you know, and also they want to do a lot of the talking. So you go, there's, you have to do a lot of listening sometimes, which is, you know, yeah. They want to tell you if they can be fun sometimes. But like remember I remember the guy at the end of the line and I'm in Toronto that had some conspiracy theory for them.

Speaker 5:          00:23:29       We talked about, oh that's so funny. He was young. It was crazy. You saw that back me up. How crazy it was that done. Yeah, that was wild. I mean, I was like, eventually I was like, Joe, we got to, um, you know, we have this thing to go. The bouncer was pulling him away and he's like, no, you don't understand. I have to communicate with them this information. It was like grabbing him, pulling him away. It's like, no, no, no, I'm, I'm going to stay. I have to talk to him. See the email I posted? Yes. It's fucking ridiculous. The most ridiculous. Yeah. But you know, it was just one of a million. There's a million guys out there like that. And it's because of me talking about psychedelic drugs and talking about DMT and weed and stuff like that. I get these people, they find me like a magnet.

Speaker 5:          00:24:06       The only thing that keeps you from being more aggressive about it is because I'm a comedian and I'm kind of talk about them. Probably black plastic. Play the podcast on the schizo radio channel on Sirius. There's a skid. So radio check. What are you talking to me? This is what it seems like that, that the, the guy from, uh, was it, uh, uh, shit. Labrea no, I know one of the local California clubs. You remember the, there, there was a guy that came up that thought we recorded and it was like we weren't going to put it online because it was too crazy, but it sounded like the same guy that you just talked to recorded. What are you talking about? Uh, some guy came up to you in line. You used to stone, right? Completely lost you. Some guy came in line with what you were signing autographs.

Speaker 5:          00:24:42       I don't know if you remember him. He came up to you and start talking like he was like, uh Oh, I know what you're talking about. Yeah, it was in, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I didn't want to talk about it. It's too annoying. Yeah, but it seems like you have like this whole like weird group of people. You're going to get that man. Doug gets that too. You're going to end anytime when you're in any sort of a public forum, whether it's a podcast, a TV show, anything. There's eyes on you and as a certain amount of them are not going to be healthy. That was the most horrible sentence structure I ever did since the, by the way, sorry, you might be retarded. You ain't want to go to a doctor. You know, you know who, who's retarded. If you guys followed any of these la reporters, uh, like, like the news in La is completely different than like, uh, like news in Ohio. Like I was watching something the other day and I found it online. This is a on the shake weight and you know the shake weight thing that, that South Park and everyone dies, right where the shake where it looks like you've eaten off. This is morning news in La. Okay. Just listen to how crazy this is. A visual thing or see the infomercial. Maybe you've seen it. Parody and uh, they're called shake weights while she's talking. The guys using it there now the focus of a brand, he's holding it.

Speaker 8:          00:25:46       That is right. Allan Mckay is shaking with excitement at the prospect of taking part of this new shake weight class. An alley sounds good. Dog to go slow or better to go fast. Get the point. I think you and you kind of bury it, bury it. You don't know how you're, you're doing, what's that noise man? That's sound effect. They can have a little mirror on the top. Is that where the cooldown spray comes out? No, actually all on south park but brought that up and it went out live mode. Trains. Yeah. It's mark here and they asked me to join in but I've got a small white one because I make a difference. No, I don't actually think it's the size of it. It's actually the technique and Kay, thank you. Thank you. Come attracting tracking that at all of men at home. We're wondering that as well. Not Chris Cause he, he told me he had the big black one. Yeah, he

Speaker 6:          00:26:51       says they pretty much had it. Well it goes on a little bit more. Nothing too funny by they go on like they actually said that he has a big black dick the whole time. The black reporters like shaking it super. Ever do a morning TV when you're on the road. No, I stopped. It was too ridiculous. So silly. It's on. It's like you're in a sketch about a bad TV show about censorship and oh yeah. It's about how you can't, yeah, yeah. They're not even a little crazy little edgy. There's no edginess and like they get this look, as soon as you get edgy, they get this look in their eye. You know the hosts, they just like are flipping out. Yeah, I stopped doing them. They're just too ridiculous. You know? I was doing a fast to give you a really long lined up and then they ask you one question and by the time you're done with your answer, your interviews almost over it.

Speaker 6:          00:27:36       Yeah. And you do radio before that, like God, all that stuff is so much this. It's, it's so much less fun than doing a podcast. You know the the best that thing about the podcast and one of the reasons why these conversations get so weird and go and sort of so many different places is when we don't have a particular start or stop time. It just kind of goes, there's not like some commercial you got to insert in there. There's not some break. We have to take, there's not some boss we have to answer to. There's not some code of words Cunt, nigger. You can say whatever you want. You can just keep going. It doesn't matter. I saw one of those the other day. I can't nigger. What did it look like? Describe it to me. Did it have high heels? Purple? Um, I'd imagine it would have like high heels, like an an our chrom comic book. Yeah. Yeah, totally. At high heels.

Speaker 6:          00:28:22       I'm trying to, yes and, but I didn't, I didn't really see one of those. You could, you know, you could do things today that you could never do back then. Back then in the old days of comedy when he had to go to local radio stations, it was always so painful. But the worst part about it was the, the TV shows for sure. Cause they would be, you know, what you'd have like what's the most you've ever done on one, seven minutes, eight minutes, right. Yeah. And it's just, it's just there. They asked that, you know, they want, they ask questions that don't lead to humorous answers. Where are you from? You know, unless you've got a chunk about, in my case, San Diego, I just always go, I'm from San Diego and then they'd say something like, Oh, it's beautiful down there. Were you a fan of the Padres?

Speaker 6:          00:28:58       Yeah. Used to go see if you're getting, you know, like you're not getting it anywhere funny you, you kind of have to take over. Like I always just pick something that's going on there and just start running on it right immediately. Like what's with this guy over here? Yes. Kind of stuff. Cause and just make it like, oh this guy's crazy. We can't even have a conversation with him because that's all you can do to to even be kind of funny. Yeah. You got to sink the ship right away. Yeah. I'm always like, if they had a cooking segment, I'm eating whatever. It was like I'm high out of my mind just sitting there eating like this is good. What's that? Your phone? Yeah. Be like this is good right now. Just get some cook it anymore. Let's just eat. I was in Kentucky and we got a me and my feature at got interviewed by like a guy, like a serious news man looking dude

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       who was like in his 50s or 60s named a, his name was uh, uh, Barry Bernson and uh, and I remember his name because it was just so amazing. We went, Oh God, this interview is going to be brutal. And we sit down and the first thing out of his mouth is, did you know that marijuana is the number one cash crop and Kentucky? And I was like, [inaudible], I like it. That is awesome that you would open up with that question. And he was like, you know, Mr Newsman and he knew that. So he, he put it in there and we had a nice little discussion about it. Is it the number one cash crop in Kentucky? It's a number one in Hawaii too. That's awesome. I wonder. He supposedly, it's the number one the country as far as couch. Doug Stanhope hates the morning news so bad that I remember when he did this where he took a friend of his, like the opener comic, the local opener comic and told him to go as Doug.

Speaker 5:          00:30:29       So the guy put on sunglasses difference. Yeah, put sunglasses on. Like I had a trench coat and I taped the whole thing. It's like 10 minutes long or something like that where he goes through a car show and he was like, we're here with Doug Stanhope now. Doug, how's it feel to be on the road and stuff like that. The guys just like, Eh, it feels amazing. But you could pull that off because a lot of times when you show up at a place, no one, there is a fan, you know, they're just like, they're just doing their job and you know, some publicists talked him into having you or whatever and it's so fun. It's really, it's really crazy doing those things. I like to do those things with. I like to bring cameras, like if it's for super high me or the documentary I did for GE for like, it just adds that extra, everyone kind of enhances their performance a little bit, you know, so like those radio people can look even crazier or even, you know, even a weirder than they actually are.

Speaker 5:          00:31:20       Whenever we do radio on the road. We always do that. We did in Austin, there's the last place I do radio was Austin. Just cause I love them. You just, you sit and film it. Yeah. We film it and then put it on the Internet. We put it, we have this little video blog that we add along to this podcast thing. Now we're expanding, expanding our outreach and uh, we just throw that stuff in there. And you know, Brian did one in Austin, the video, what was it called? Austin Little Austin. A little awesome. Something, something like that. And so yeah, it'd be a cap. See Comedy Club in Austin on June 1st and second Dublin plugs. You can't bring up a city with about me having a gig coming up there. I'm, I'm going everywhere. Oh yeah. Yeah. Cause I just go places for a night or two now.

Speaker 5:          00:32:01       I don't do weekends in a pill in the club. Ever. Ever, ever. What did you start doing this? Just like in the last year or so? I just kind of figured it out. They're like, especially in the winter time, I only want to, you know, I'll just bop around Florida and California and then the rest of the year I just hit everywhere else. So what do you do for Friday and Saturday? Sometimes we'll have a show, but it'd be like in a rock club or something. So I don't have to do, I don't have to do to that night. It's cool. Really. And when did you start doing this? So you said a year and a half ago I would be, you know, in the last, it's been a transition, but like this year I finally put my foot down. I just like, unless it's like, you know, helium in Portland, the last time I played there I did five shows where there were, nobody had said a peep out of the audience.

Speaker 5:          00:32:38       They were the most amazing crowds I ever played for. Yeah. It was like when that was one of the last weekends I was doing a full weekend in a club. So I consider doing that again there. But I just don't like to show nights because you always second show is always going to be drunker, you know, I like, I like people at eight o'clock. I think that's a perfect time for people to watch a comedy show and it'll be done by 10 then go then go get shit. Just, you know, there's no reason to be shit faced during the show, you know, use that always ruins it. My people are always going to be fucked up though. Yeah. Well those people to accept a certain level of fucked up and this, cause I'm going to be fucked up too. But I'm just saying that like it's easy to like get really high and then go into the comedy club and oh I got to get a couple drinks.

Speaker 5:          00:33:18       All right. You know, give me something that they asked. They asked for something that's you know, too much and they, so they ended up being, you know, even worse than the typical drunk. They're like, uh, someone that doesn't drink that much being drunk, you know, you've broken these people down psychologically. Yeah. It's really, it's really interesting. Like, cause uh, most of my audience is just high and having a good time, but like it's easy for, you know, somebody to be like, I get people come up to me after shows all the time. I'd never been to a comedy club before and so I think the idea of like having to have drinks is overwhelming and you order like a long island ice tea or some shit like that that like, you know, you're going to be a man. I don't have a straight after it.

Speaker 5:          00:33:57       You don't have a problem with people being drunk. I like, I'm drunk. It's definitely part of the case difference part of the game for sure. I don't, I would never want to do a show and I probably have done a few, but I don't want to do a show where there's no alcohol being served. I've done the, I love the alcohol's being served. I've done those. But yeah, I agree. Yeah. I've been in like a, you know, marijuana logs was in a theater, so nobody was really drinking. But um, but yeah, I, but I just don't like the whole comedy club thing of not, uh, not only are they drunk, they also possibly just interested because they just came to see comedy with quotes around it and they didn't, uh, you know, bother to research like, like Bachelorette parties. You still have one of those from time to time.

Speaker 5:          00:34:38       Right. Because the comedy clubs, they booked that date. They didn't book it because you are going to be there. That's the night of their Bachelorette party, you know, and then they go and they do what they always do, which has ruined it for every table around them. Yeah. We had a bad one in Austin. I remember we had those girls kicked out and the one girl said she was gonna Sue. Why did they even have hubs allowed? UBERKITTENS cause they want to make some money, do what they do like the money. But I do think that that would be cool if a comedy clubs stepped up and said, you know what? No bachelorette parties and a group of six women want to come down. I refuse to believe that. All bachelorettes or cons I refuse. I know a lot of good. I've had some good ones and I always congratulate them because it's a, it's amazing when they're good. I as soon as I see a Bachelorette party in the audience, I'm like, oh there's, there's the lady in the Dildo hat that's had too much to drink and then I'm going to have to deal with her the whole show. And it's, you know, cause they want it to be about them. They don't want, they're not there to, they're not there to share. And a comedian with the rest of the audience, right. They're there to have a private performance. They should just hire us to come and call them a bunch

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       of, you know, you stupid see words and then they laugh and give us money. This is the thing that some women have, and I want to say women, but dumb checks have, you know, I know it's not you girls, but there's some of them have where if it's their birthday or if it's an anniversary or if it's their bachelorette party, they feel like they are as to number one really it's my birthday or like, whoa, reach when it's my birthday. Don't you get that constantly, but that's a good, but that's on Twitter. That's not annoying to me, but at a comedy club, how many clubs do it more than dudes? It was a video of one. The girl, we got a video of this girl, she was heckling and then afterwards we're back at the back of the comedy club and a, I go, you know,

Speaker 9:          00:36:18       oh, you're such a jerk. You're such a jerk. And I go, you wouldn't shut up. And they'll go, hey, it's her birthday. It's her birthday. I go, you're yelling in the middle of a common.

Speaker 6:          00:36:26       Then she called me fat. I pulled my shirt up. I'm like, bitch was called Joe Rogan. Fatso. Yeah, she called me fat and I'm like, why? Where are you getting fat? Cause I wear baggy clothes, you know, a lot of times on stage and aware like a baggy sweatshirt and I guess she thought I was covering something so I had a show where the slabs, I get that same shit all the time. Yeah, I know man. It was a pretty good judge though. As far as like own edge videos. It's like 14 seconds of shut the fuck up and it's like so quick. It's like a you, you know why

Speaker 9:          00:36:58       you guys stop. Oh it's your birthday. You're such a jerk. It's her birthday. I'm like, listen, I'm just a comedian. You guys wouldn't shut the fuck up

Speaker 6:          00:37:04       fat. You're fat. Like puffer cheeks out at me. Like wow, rude. If I was fat with differences that make it fun, fat, you're still a cunt. It ever, everyone I've met, every single person I've met who said you were mean to me during a show one day I say, were you drunk? And then Diego. Yeah. And then I go, do you remember anything that either of US said? No. They just walk away with this impression that you're the asshole because they ruined the show and you had him thrown out or you or you, you know, put, put them in their place. Do you recognize the obligation that you have to be a little more nice than the average person because you're famous when someone meets you that they're going to be a little weirded out by it all and so you have to give them some slack.

Speaker 6:          00:37:43       Yeah, I know. That's why I'm always kind of offended or surprised when people have a different perception. Like a guy recently wrote on Twitter, you know, I just got to tell you or was a girl, but she was like, it was going to tell you you were kind of a Douche when we met you after your show and and wherever Dallas or whatever. And it's just like right back and forth a little bit and you start to get the, oh no, no, they did. You know, they, they three back down immediately. They don't, they don't really mean like douche sounds harsher to me than they probably meant it to be. You know, I've, I've met people before and not even famous people before, but I met people when I was younger and for whatever reason I chose to not like them. You know, like your pick something like something he said something and you blow it out of proportion, you make a fucking big deal out of it. And then it, because you know, it's like, it's almost like a natural thing to do when the person's not there, you know, if you're weak, you know, I had an instance on a, at this website that go to mixed martial arts.com

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       where I met a guy in an elevator. Okay. And I didn't even meet him in the elevator. We were all in the elevator together. No one said anything. And apparently on the way out he said hello where he said something and he doesn't, doesn't think that I responded. So he went online and wrote this whole long thing rogue me being a churchy. Sure wanna be and he's twice as big as me and fuck, he was rude to me. They'd go right into everything they supposedly hate about you, but they know it all because they had liked all those things about you. Like they are a fan and then they just suddenly, no, this wasn't even realistic. This, he suddenly turned on you though the turns so fast. Well this wasn't even a turn. I mean this, this was a, just an undoubtedly a guy with issues undoubtedly of guy with, you know, he's on a mixed martial arts website.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       A lot of those guys have anger issues. You know, like I have in my past, I've had a lot of anger issues. I understand it and you know, it's his interaction with someone who's, you know, famous and all of a sudden, you know, he's comparing himself to me and he's a bigger person than me. So he's got that over me and then he feels like he said something to me and I didn't respond. So it was like fall camp. So the rest of it was fuck him. And then he gets online and writes this whole thing and I said, listen man, I don't know what happened, but if I saw you, I guarantee you I'm one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. I saw, I just turned, my grandmother died and I was standing in an elevator. Right? It could be anybody. It could be anything like it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:57       Also just that, that'd be that crazy to think just because they're saying it as they leave the elevator, that that a of response absolutely must be forthcoming or something. People want you to be a cunt. They really do. They root for you to suck because if you're not happy that with the way your life is going and you meet somebody that you feel envious of, where you feel like, you know, why is this person in the public eye and I'm not being the public eyes, a weird fucking thing. And if you're a guy, a lot of guys wish they were famous, like 99% wish they were something of significance. Even if they're not, you know, even if it's not famous, they want to be wealthy. They want to be a a man that you admire. They want to be someone in a high position. It's just normal chimpanzee shit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       So when you meet some guy and you're like, who the fuck is this? Doug Benson, we with you? He's not fucking cool to me. What? I fucking buy your CD fucking shithead. And you're like, I didn't know you said Hi. Sorry I was on the phone. They just don't, they open with that stuff. Yeah. They just walk right out. Oh yeah, they're looking at you. Yeah. I guess you're a hot shot, Huh? Everybody over there has been saying that you in some sort of movie or something. Why do you think you're so special? It's amazing. You know what dude say to me all the time, I thought you were taller all the time and they want to hang out and be friendly. We want to see if I thought you were taller and it's, it's not like there's no sense of, you know, like social awareness.

Speaker 1:          00:41:17       There's no second. Yeah, I know. They're totally like, I'll be more interesting than somebody else, but can go take a ruler mark out five foot eight on your wall. If you see me, expect me to be there. That's how tall I am. I've been this tall for 43 fucking years. That's fine. People can plan for it. Let's get mean. Do you go up to blind people and fucking give him the finger? Like what do you do? What are you doing man, you you getting is a great idea. They wouldn't even talk a lot of shit around the deaf, but they would hear the whisper of your front hand over my mouth and through the year. What if they grabbed your wrist and some Steven Seagal constantly. Likewise your finger in front of my face, mother fucker. You get your finger in front of my face because I'm blind.

Speaker 7:          00:42:00       There's a, there's a new blind guy that's at my Starbucks. I go to Starbucks everyday so I see the same people every day kind of thing. And there's a new guy just recently became blind and I feel bad for him because he's a little older guy and stuff like that, but he's the worst blind person ever because he says pretty much groping people. He's like running into people like he has the one that sticks and he's a slapping little kids over is sit there in line and everyone's just like in shock ready to just like grab him.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       Maybe his hearing's not good. And you know like, uh, like the blind, they say that your hearing gets much better and you tuned into your senses. But if he became blind as he got older, yeah, maybe he's hearing is already bad. And then he goes blind.

Speaker 7:          00:42:38       Well, I mean there's people like rearranging Starbucks just so he can walk.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       How does Aldon all to feel about them? Any, any issues or weird by the way that I think about it for people don't know what we're talking about. Brian was stones and he ran into Alan Alda and he was pretty sure Alan Alda was mad dogging them. See, it's basically what we just talked about. It's like you did it with Alan Alda. Be like, fuck out all that he got on the podcast and double finger. Don't Fuck Allen.

Speaker 7:          00:43:02       That does look concern. Like he somehow knew that three 15 year olds just showed me they're buttholes.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       Yeah. That was on you though too. Some girls flashed him. Some little school girls thought it was cute to Flash Brian and it was buttholes and vaginas. There was, everyone was end vaginas. The whole package. The whole package. Well, it's good because if it wasn't just a butthole and nothing else and you'd be like, what the fuck are you trying to, is this a cry for help? Is this a flesh colored SOS? Heine I'll tell you something about Alan Alda though. I hope. Please do it. Doesn't do autographs. Doesn't really, yeah, so that, say anybody that meets him could walk away going, what a Dick. Because he just says, I'd rather just shake your hand or whatever and I'd rather shake someone's hand to, but if they want me to write something down I'll, I'll be happy too because then they can remember it. They look at it and they remember it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       It's just the only problem with autographs and shit like that and photos like especially the only time I really ever an issue with it is that the UFC, because sometimes I just can't do it. Like when I'm working, you know you've been in the UFC cage side, I'm supposed to stay cage side and these people was like, come over, take a picture of like the fights are going to start in one minute. I can't just one. I can't do just one because you look behind you, there's a thousand people. I can't just take one and you know sometimes like you got to go to press conferences and there you have to run through these people like I'm sorry I have to go. That's the only time. But other times I see people and making them happy to sign your shit. I'll pass on people. When I was a little kid, ace freely signed a piece of paper for me, man, and I washed it accidentally like a retard, but I, it was so faint I could still see it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       So I went over it with a sharpie. I went over the very careful cause I wasn't an artist very carefully with a sharpie and then my aunt I, you know, she goes, did you go over it with a marker? And I said, yeah, and you know what she said? She goes, it's not going to be worth as much now. I'm like, what a, can't put a negative comment. My mom sold my Bob hope autograph and a garage sale for 5 cents. She sold it to at five sentence when I met Bob Hope, I also met Sean Connery at that person made like, you know, 10 or 15 more cents on it. Why would you sell your autographed copy of Bob Hope's autograph? She just took all my books and she's like, I'm just getting rid of it. And I had a book that had a Sean Connery and Bob Hope's autograph on it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       It was a like a guide to this golf tournament, like one of those program guides or whatever. And they were assigned both of it and they were really cool autographs and she sold it like a whole box of books for Torrey Pines, that tournament? No, it's called the memorial tournament in Columbus, Ohio. It's like once a year. It's like Jack Nicklaus and started it and it's pretty big one. It's all the celebrities used to always go there and kind of a weak move by your mother. I went to one down south. Where are they? They did it every year. I'd go with my dad and I get pictures of the weirdest celebrities and of course Bob hope was there, so I got to have a picture of like I hate stood in front of is a golf cart. Oh really? Yeah. And uh, they had to kind of yell at me, get out of the way, but I got the shot.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       I was like, yeah, I was eating very, a young pup. Razzi he signed my autograph it with anything. There was a big crowd and he just went right to me. He didn't sign anyone else's autografting got [inaudible] you got kid guy. OCD is fun on Twitter. Reminded me that the chicken Austin who was heckling, who was the Bachelorette was screaming. Sarah Pailin is my aunt. She was telling me that Sarah Palin was her aunt. Like she has some power. Do you say normally or what is she saying? God, I say aunt [inaudible]. I say aunt cause it was so funny. You don't say Aston Fundraising Austin to yell on cause it sounds so proper. Right? Wait, wait. Yeah. I say Anna Nerissa heard aunt. There's a u in there bro on now. But my friend Dmitri said it best because I was trying to figure out what is right, what is wrong and he said there's a u in there.

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       That's why I say [inaudible]. I'm like God damn it. You're right. And we gave knuckles to each other. We both agreed on is. It is. So you also go with often over often? No, I think I said it was a t in there. I say often I allow science, silent t's. I don't allow silent use. Those sound used can go fuck themselves. That's what I say. You got your own set of rules. My rules, we already have an answer. Okay. We've got plenty of yours to need more confused than the English language. Apparently the English language is a motherfucker if you come from another language, but man, you know what to me is a motherfucker's any Asian language where they have characters. It's supposed to be good for you to learn other languages. You know it's supposed to be a conversation. If you're young, I'm this close to pulling the trigger on just getting a Rosetta stone for some, you know, Spanish or something and download it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       Really trying to learn another one. I love the Latino culture. I would love to do, if I had enough Spanish to do a Latino comedy shows, I think that'd be cool. I would love to do that. I'd love to do some Chels Latino shows with Joey Diaz, but I would have to open shitty Spanish. Let's seriously Joe it. Let's learn Spanish and then do some shows. How long would it take for us? I Dunno. My Buddy learned Portuguese and Rosetta stone and like a few months. Really? Did he get Brazil or Portugal? Uh, Brazil. Wow, that's awesome. They have a different flavor of a Portuguese cause I've heard people speak Portuguese and Brazilian sounds so much cooler, like catch Italian, such a wild country. Brazilians are mad at me. There's a few that don't get it. They're upset at my toxoplasma comments. I love Brazil. I'm a, I'm a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       I've been studying it since 1996 I have a ton of Brazilian friends chew. Hoss Korea's from those. The fogo de Chao. That's my favorite. All time food. And you're going to be there. It's 29th. I might not. I might be giving my, I might be getting my tonsils removed my titles and my adenoids. Yeah. I, you know, I have sleep apnea. I have to sleep with a mouth piece and I've just broke it the other day when I was in Toronto and had a glue this fucking thing together with Krazy glue. And Kevin Booth, uh, the guy was bill Hicks, producer. He produced my first DVD that we filmed in Austin and he just got the operation time and he told me it's awesome and he can breathe so much better now. And I have, I have a fat neck man. I have a big tongue. And what they do is when my, when I go to sleep, my tongue like closes over my air hole and it, you know, you, you, you choke and you gag.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       So I have this mouthpiece. It keeps my tongue in place. But if the mouthpiece breaks, I'm fucked. And then I don't sleep right. And then I wake up a bunch of times in the middle of the night because I'm coughing. It's like 34 times an hour. My sleep gets interrupted by, by choking and gagging. It's like some pretty serious shit. It's like every two minutes I'm choking. So, um, I have to do something about it. And this is a, that's a good stretch of time. So if I have that operation, I probably won't be in Brazil. But the point is all these Brazilian people got mad at me the other day on Twitter. They were like, Yo, you're talking all these sheets about Brazil. You know, because I said the toxoplasma makes is 66% of Brazil's infected. It might be as high as 80% of that belief and that it makes men aggressive and then it doesn't have the same effect on women and in fact makes it more submissive.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       And the, they've actually found a direct correlation between successful soccer teams and toxoplasma infesting infections because this, this parasite actually makes people aggressive and make people reckless. And that's why I said it's like mean think when you think about Brazil, you think about these wild motherfuckers and you think about these beautiful women. And I'm like, how crazy is it that 60% of this country is infected more by this, this toxo plasma? And then you find out that there's other strains of this shit and that it's not just, it's also, by the way, 60 million Americans are infected by this shit too. So I'm not like shitting on Brazil when I'm talking about is some weird, it's like thinking about nationalism at this point is the most ridiculous thing to do because what you should be thinking about is that there's a brain parasite, a parasite that affects the way your fucking brain works.

Speaker 1:          00:50:26       In 66% of Brazil's infected by 80% of France is infected by it. 60 million Americans. And these people are like, Oh, you've tooken all this shits about Brazil. And I don't know if it's a translation issue. I don't know if they just have it and they're pissed. They're screaming at you. Could be that. It could hurt, effected. It could be that. But I think it's a nationalism thing too. I think if they don't understand the language very well, they can get confused and think that I'm talking shit on Brazil. So the last thing we'll do, why would I do that? So fucking awesome country. It's a wild country. It's the country of one of my favorite things to do. Brazilian Jujitsu. If it wasn't for the Brazilians, man wasn't for the one family, that Gracie family and all of the off shoots. You know, everyone who learned under that, my ada dude, everyone who learns Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       What a fascinating group of human beings. They literally changed martial arts. You know, I did martial arts my whole life dude. And up until 1993 no one had any idea what Jujitsu was. No one had an, there was a few people that knew like a few gene labelle's out there. And guys who knew about judo. I knew wrestlers, you could take it down and you know, I'd heard a choke holds and stuff before, but there was nothing like as comprehensive as Brazilian Jujitsu as you know, exhibited by hoists. Gracie, when you first entered into the octagon, that fucking blew everybody's mind. And it's one bad ass family from Brazil. Ilial Gracie, the old man of, of Brazil. It was such a bad motherfucker. He had like 16 sons or something crazy. And they're all killers. They're all, he like made an army of, of black belt killers.

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       Every one of his sons. Holys Helson uh, all of them fucking Hickson. The, all of his sons were these bad ass savages that could strangle you. I mean, it's amazing. They're cousins Carlson. It's like there's all these fucking other people in, in, in, in involved in the, in the family tree. Everybody connected. Like what a weird, a weird place. What an amazing thing that something is. [inaudible] this one guy and his family gave birth to this revolution in martial arts. Like fuck all the other martial artists throughout history. No one's ever had the kind of contribution that this one families had. The Gracie family has done something like when you talk about like the, the biggest contributors to martial arts, there's no one who's even close to them. No one comes close. There's people who have helped and karate and it's more time masters and there's people perfected boxing.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       There's great wrestlers, there's all these great. But as far as like one influential family, no one can fuck with the Gracies. It's amazing. Have you been tinkering? The lady called you fat and you just met your neck. Yeah. Have you, have you been tested for toxic plastic? Me. Just for fun. Just to, maybe you've been hanging out with all these Brazilians and stuff. Maybe they sneeze like you get it that way, bro. I'll get it from cats. The cats. Maybe they had cat feral cats. You have to be very careful with feral cats. A lot of feral cats have it and uh, it's uh, it's, they get it from killing rats and the way it works. I've talked about this before on the podcast. So in, in the interest of brevity, just look up toxo plasma on Google. The short version is it's a parasite that affects rats and it makes them lose it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       They lose their fear of cats and it makes them horny for the smell of cat piss. It rewires their bra. They go near the cat, the cat them. Then the cat gets this toxoplasma cat shits in the grass. Animals get it. You eat the animal, you get it, you touch the cat shit, you get it. You know the cat feces. Somehow like cat cats lay their dirty asses on your kitchen table or they clean themselves. And if you drop a cookie on that and then you eat that cookie, you could easily get some cat feces and your food. You'd be amazed if you have cats where you have cat feces, you probably have it all on your phones everywhere. They scraped the cat litter box and they didn't. They'd lay in there around and then they walk around. He sees went right in my mouth the second I walked in there.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       Dirty little cons. But you know, the bottom line is, the real concern is feral cats. If you have cats that don't leave your house, you don't have to worry about it. But if you have feral cats, there's videos online of cat of rats that are infected by Toxo and they run right up to cats and jump on them. They don't give a fuck about cats. There's, or there's a crazy video of a rat. There's like three cats and it's an outdoor rat and this rat runs up to these cats and just starts jumping up in the air and like snapping at these cats. He's not scared of him at all. And the cats are freaking out and they don't even know to kill him. They'll look for, they don't such bizarre behavior. So my friends in Brazil, I love you relax the Fogo de Chao talking shit. I'm not talking shit about Brazil.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       I love Brazil. I got all these fights between fuck you, Joe Rogan and all this crazy shit in Portuguese too. I'm like, please people relax. It's Americans to 60 million. It's, you need to be concerned about this fucking thing and people need to protect their kids and you need to protect babies because when babies get it, it's very, very dangerous. Pregnant women get it. It's very, very dangerous when pregnant women, uh, that's one of the things that doctors tell them very specifically. Do not fuck with litter boxes when you're pregnant because if you get that toxo they're just learning about this stuff, man. Their Geo Xo, toxic plasma May. Yeah. Toxoplasma Gondii or Toxo. Plasmosis it's a, it's some creepy shit, man. And you know crazy. Yeah. I never heard about it until a couple tough years ago. He said, I'll get tested. Take bets. See. I probably haven't. You think you have it could have it have a test for.

Speaker 1:          00:55:24       I've had a wild, a lot of wild cats. I had a, I had feral cats in the past. Interesting. I'm going to have it. I've pretty reckless. I'm pretty reckless, you know, I feel stupid shit. I feel pretty angry. I'm not angry as long as I work out, but if I don't work out, supposedly, if your immune system is strong, it keeps it in check and fights it off pretty well. My immune system's not bad, but I should get tested. They say a disproportionate amount of motorcycle accident victims test positive for toxo. Why? They don't know the doctors are people are reckless. Yeah, maybe. I guess that's weird to think about. Yeah. It's pretty ballsy riding around on a motorcycle. Yeah. Especially in La. I understand that a lot more in like a Texas or in like an open area, like they can never be too open.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       I like, you know, there's just, cars are not looking for you. If you want to learn more about this, this is the number one expert is a guy named Robert Sapolsky. And His name, if you spell it, s a p o. O. L. S. K. Y. Just look up doctor. So Polski [inaudible] um, and then, uh, and look up toxo plasma and you'll, you'll find it. Just Google that and he's off every word about it. Oh No, no, no, no, no. It's way more connected to schizophrenia. It's connected to a bunch of different things. There's a, you know, there's a lot of instances in the wild of parasites changing the behavior of their hosts and causing their host to even commit suicide. You know, there's a lot of different things, like there's a warm that we've talked about before and aquatic worm that grows inside of a grasshopper and then once it reaches the point of gestation, convinces the grasshopper to jump in the water and the grasshopper drowns and then escapes by crawling out of its body.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       It just breaks out of its body like the alien chest. Burster that's pretty sweet and it's pretty dope when you think about it. If nature is to devise some incredible ways to keep moving on, you know, and we are the most incredible, you know, we, we look to look at all these crazy parasites like, wow, that's amazing man. A worm grows in a grasshopper. Fuck a worm and fucker. Grasshopper. What about people you know, were the weirdest thing to nature's ever created? Man, we can't even, we have to wear clothes. We wear some shit that we invent. We all do with what percentage of the population, whereas

Speaker 7:          00:57:37       close, just so you won't jump on me. Everybody take a shot. If you want the Rogan drinking game, the old Brian shot it's time. Oh Brian. That's what he's there for. If you, if you weren't near him and you saw her a lot, your body all the time, you would know. You wouldn't know where those comments stem from. I was glad you grew a beard because I, your face used to be so kissable I couldn't, it doesn't look like you're 36 yeah. When's your birthday? August 4th then you'd be Leo anymore, but you should shut up. Yeah, that shit all around. Didn't they shift? You know, that's all bullshit. You just sort of a new gay, that was all distinction. That was all bullshit. Yeah. That, that the person that was saying all that shit was bullshit. Supposedly the, this, this a straw with money in astrology if stepped on that guy.

Speaker 7:          00:58:33       But it's stuff funny. This astrology thing is bullshit. This one's bullshit. Those other ones are legit. I don't believe in astrology. I definitely believe in being born and a certain time of the year if I, if me and you were born in August, I think that there's a lot of different little things that are different than say somebody who's born in November, you know, just like little things, like as an example, when we were growing up our birthdays that were never announced on this school message system, you know, so we had that little bit of difference and you can't let it go. Can, you know, like little things like that. That's what, that's, that's Kinda what I believe there is. I think

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       man, whenever something is around for a long time, I consider it whenever something's around, whether it's religion, whether it's, you know, whether it's some sort of a belief of the cyclical nature of the universe. You know, an age is like you, you look into like the what the Mayans believe in it. And whenever you look into anything that people believe for a long period of time, we've got to go, hmm, where's all this coming from? Where, what does this astrology thing and why did you all you people that were struggling to find food to eat and fighting off diseases, why did you all agree on this? Why did you all get together and decide that there's 12 Zodiac symbols and each one of them represents a very distinct sort of personality and that, you know, they can't, you know, they can't like mingle with each other and be happy because this one counteracts that one.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       And I don't know, I don't know if it's really, I'm not, but I know that it gets all those things started. Like there's somebody that everybody listens to maybe, but it's super complicated. It's not like when you think about like the shit that you get, like when you go to the newspaper and you look under Leo and you go, Oh, that's not me, but that doesn't, that's silly. That's silly. But apparently if they could find out, hey, Brian Ryko was born at 3:00 AM and where was he born? He was born in Columbus, Ohio at 3:00 AM on August the fourth and they can look at that and they can go, oh, okay. And we'll back then, whatever the year, what, what year was that? 74 1974 this was happening and this star was here on this planet was here and this, I think there's gotta be something to that. And it sounds hippy and sounds ridiculous, but we, we know that the moon affects the tides. We know that. And we know that people are certain, we thought it was 90% when you're correct, and it's like 60% water. So people are 60 something percent water. We know that there's some sort of an effect just based on gravity. And we know that also planets must affect us. The gravity of, you know, Star

Speaker 7:          01:00:50       when you were conceived, even, even going back months to when you're conceived, the depressure of when you came into from sperm hitting the egg, what was the bearer pressure? You know, is it like know it was at a high pressure? Maybe that changes though. Cause it's such a small little thing anyways that, you know, the, the littlest thing could change,

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       right? A lot of pressure. When you were, I know there's a lot of friends, were you in Colorado? Were you in Florida? You know, where were you? Where, where was it happening? How racist are you going to be? How much oxygen did you bring get when you were born? Did you got wd 40? Maybe that's one of the reason why people in Colorado so cool. Maybe just, just always just a little high because it's so the altitude, it's really, um, I gotta be careful whenever I go there with booze. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You've gotta be careful with booze. Booze will knock you. Run Your Dick. If you, I wish you would come to see that fucking house. And I had rented up in the mountain. Man, when you get high up there, Holy Shit at 8,300 feet above sea level, when you get high, it's like, it's, it's a different sort of experience. It's like, it's like eating pot, you know when you smoke it, it's, it'd be just like eating it. It was just like blast right into yourselves. Really kind of crazy man, you know? Cause there's not much oxygen up there. So for whatever reason the marijuana hits yarder booze hits your heart. It's going to hit me really hard on June 18th and how many works downtown or Larimer Square? Lammers squares. Hard to find because the street's not on the fucking navigation system. That's a new one. Yeah. That's when I realize how connected I am to electronics.

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       Like they gave me some directions over the phone. Yeah. Turn right here. I'll go. Okay. Okay, okay. Or tried to remember it, but then I just plugged into my navigation system. Like what the fuck do you mean it's not here? So I had to try to get something reasonably close.

Speaker 7:          01:02:32       I hate that. I hate the shit when it's just something small to where it's like you didn't choose Las Angeles and Beverly Hills or you didn't do

Speaker 6:          01:02:40       oh spell outdoors little peccadilloes this little little differences like it's amazing to me. Like it's funny to me when you type in something something.com and you excellently hit a comma that they haven't worked that out yet where we just go, oh you meant to put a period there. There's no reason to have a comma in a, in a URL. It doesn't even make sense. But you just got to work that stuff out. There's so many, like I'm sure every time they, you know like spell check on my new iPhone is going to have, yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:03:08       What supposedly iPhone just hired uh, one of the guys that, fuck, I can't remember it to do their maps, they're going to try to, I think have a driving type maps on the upcoming iPhone

Speaker 6:          01:03:18       is the new iPhone is going to be big. Like the HCC,

Speaker 7:          01:03:21       I don't believe it's going to be bigger than the screen might go from corner to corner. Like there'd be less real state. You know, like if you look at the iPhone now, there's like a big chunk on the top and bottom, you know that's not screen right. I believe that probably that will be stretched out, but I don't think the phone's going to be actually bigger. I don't like those big huge droid phones where it seems like there's, there's the Tia 81 calculator in your pocket.

Speaker 6:          01:03:42       Okay. This is a little big, but God damn, it's awesome when you're scrolling through web pages, your life's not awesome at all. Triply. Yeah. Triple who was complaining about his battery life, but he's got that HTC evo when you're online with that thing, that is the shit first of all. That four G is fucking dope. Yeah. God Damn. It's awesome. He was pulling up web pages like you're at home on cable modems. It's amazing. Like Bang, Bang photos. Instantly everything. They measured one of Verizon's new phones, the thunderbolt or HTCs thunderbolt, the fucking, they showed the, on one of the online websites where they analyze a cell phones, they showed the download and upload speed. It's like fucking cable modems. It's insane for g is ridiculously fast and you know what else is cool about those droids? You can talk text messages. You press a little thing and you go, hey Doug, I'm running 10 minutes late. I'll call you when I get there and it's really fucking accurate. It's really good. Like I did it with my friends. The only thing he got wrong was my name. Here's a few, said, hey, what's up? This is Joe Rogan and I just want to say I love you. It got everything like said. It said Logan instead of Rogan.

Speaker 7:          01:04:47       There's tons of apps for that though, for the iPhone and stuff like that for tweets and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah. They even have dragon on the iPhone, but the

Speaker 6:          01:04:54       right, but does that go straight into tweets? It's an option when you, like if you, if you go for tweets or text messages, it's an option. Like you know how like you look at your thing and you can add a photo or something like that. You can make an an MMS, you know what I mean? With them it's like, here's the video here. You can add this and here you can do it by voice. Logan Rogan things going to be a great like misunderstanding in some sort of Romcom or something. They'll del La, they'll take advantage of that. It'd be like a story twist that somebody who meant to, you know meant to the voice message one person and it will be a murder out wrong. It would fuck Joe Logan and Joe Logan Credit. He was like, fuck you. And the guy's like, I don't even know you.

Speaker 6:          01:05:32       Oh yeah. Well I fucking know you. I know where you live. And then shit got crazy. And really it was just because of me, bro gains its worst. That's the worst when you're losing your hair especially. And your name is Rogan and the stuff that cures your hair is like Rogaine. That's, that's so rude. That would have been really rough if you were losing your hair when you were a kid. I was with Amy, who's, who's who is Joe Rogan. I doubt many people would dare yelled at at you. What are you talking about? I hear that every day. People yelling at you, they call you. Yeah. Oh yeah. I've heard it a million times. Wow. Andy Dick use it on Howard Stern, the nerve of people. I dodge that bullet when Andy Dick fell off the wagon. I said, he has to be sober for a year before he can come over my house.

Speaker 6:          01:06:16       So when he got arrested I was like, yeah, it's just bought myself some time. Start the clock again another year. Andy, as he can never draws them. I'm so Saba. He's still welcome at the death squad. Izzy is welcome at your house and whether you like it or not, he knows we live in a strategic move. I ran into him on the streets a couple of weeks ago at the Bridgetown comedy festival and it was, you know, 6:00 PM or something. He was just gone and just being a complete asshole. I was just like, Margaret Cho was dragging him around is so crazy. It was. I didn't know that. He's talked to a ton of shit about me on I'm mark Marin's podcast. We're just talking about me. When we were younger on Newsradio about what an asshole I was to him. I said, no idea and that, and then, you know, he came on the podcast and you barely see he was, he was, he was intimating that, you know, I was mean to him when he was young, but I'm like, dude, he used to pull your dick out.

Speaker 6:          01:07:11       He used to show up fucked up. Couldn't probably just always hate it. Look on your face like, what the fuck are you doing? It was hard work. That's translates into you. He's a meaning you to see it as a stand around and laugh at all my antics. But on Marin's podcast, God, he like had, it's so twisted. It was so ridiculous. I don't, that's, I don't think he should be a witness for anything. I don't think you should ever get to say, well, here's what I thought happened. Are you kidding? I want him writing my autobiography. This is what I remember. You're hangry. You so angry at me. He, I was, uh, in my, in my trailer with my girlfriend and I go, what do you Jang janking they're aging and they're like, I'm getting dressed Andy up and up to when I talk to you.

Speaker 6:          01:07:51       So open up the door. He's got his dick in his hand. It's not even hard. And he's like, kind of like pull on us. Are you mad that it's not hard or would you rather have some respect? You know, don't be so, so brave that you could pull your dick out. It's not even hard yet. It's just assuming you're such a bad mother fucker. You can keep this party going, but that's what she does do right? Don't flashers. Just show their flacid Dick. Do they? I don't think they work one up and then open their trench coat. There's no such thing as flashers anymore. Did you know that you're all wet shoes, bro? This plenty of flashes. I would you talking about Brian? I know a bunch of girls who've had guys whipped your dick. Yes, I know a bunch. I think about doing it all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:08:30       Comics, one day I might pull the trigger. I might go through with this check off. Doug, did you ever have them on your show? Who, Andy? Yeah, he did, uh, just with, we didn't tape it for anything, but he did show up on one of my, uh, interruption shows and it just became like kind of a serious conversation about, you know, what he was going through at that time. You know, he had the, he had the thing on his ankle and, you know, part of things trying guy like Andy. Andy's a very funny man. He's one of the funniest guys I've ever worked with. One of the most talented, like comedic actors I ever worked with. And I really do love the Guy I, even though I don't want them over my house, I really do love, he's an incredibly gifted, but in a way it's almost like he's so gifted from such an early age that like that can kind of turn somebody into a Weirdo that they, you know, they, they can't really relate to people in an irregular way because there, I think he had, I told him, I don't think it's, that's it at all knowing Andy hit fucking horrendous childhood.

Speaker 6:          01:09:29       It was beyond, he can't even remember it, but it was probably so freeing to run it, to end up with a, you know, Ben Stiller and that whole crowd and to be, and to be, you know, like how old was he when the Ben Stiller show was on early twenties right? Yeah. He must have been, cause he's pretty young. It's a couple of years older than me. I think he's 45 talent. He had the kind of talent that Dan Akroyd had in the first few seasons of a SNL where he was 20 but he could play a 50 year old and a sketch. And you don't even question. It was Dan Akroyd 20 he was super young when the, the first season of SNL, he must've been 2120 something like that. Dan Akroyd, he's [inaudible] man because he's a guy that went from the blues brothers to some of those fucking movies that he did were just like, what happened?

Speaker 6:          01:10:11       Did, did this, you have no control over this or did you actually think this was funny? I need to know. I need to know if you'd liked Caddyshack two. I need to know there's a lot of three or whatever the fuck it was. Yeah, it was two sergeant Bilko, you know, or any of that crap at either. But you know, that's the thing is you take a Steve Martin, you know, he does some dumb, you know, bringing down the house kind of stuff. But he also is writing books and playing his Banjo and he's, he's clearly, you know, still a very talented, if not completely with it, but somebody like Dan Akroyd, you just, you just wonder how did that talent gets squandered. Cause he was also great at playing characters and then he sort of like just became the Dan Akroyd character and everything, which was just kind of like a, you know, goofy pump is fat guy or whatever.

Speaker 6:          01:10:55       I blamed the House of Blues. Well that's uh, that's the best thing he's ever done that in the blues brothers. Um, but yeah, he's a, he's a crazy UFO head to yeah. Yeah. He's super into that stuff. He's a believer, you know, a real believer. You know, Colin had coneheads movies. Not that bad. No, it's not that bad. Yeah. Bad is you take like, you think, oh, that must have been really weak. But it was, it was actually pretty good. No, that was decent. It was decent. But like the blues brothers, like one of the greatest of all time. Yeah. I'm to see that again soon. There's going to be a double bill at the new Beverly of that and I'm raising Arizona. Ah, when is this? That's a Friday night. This Friday night. Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to party with Doug Benson and Los Angeles, where's it at? It's the new Beverly.

Speaker 6:          01:11:37       The new Beverly, you should get stuck at seven 30 to nine 30. You should fucking organize mass. Like Oh, screenings like organize, say hey everybody, let's go Friday, April 20, whatever. It's funny movie theaters just for his fans and packs it. Who Does Mc? Chris, how much does it cost to rent out a whole movie theater? I don't know. But they do it all the time. So a lot of money man. Yeah, no, but I don't need to like $20 seats. How much does the seat? Well No, they have deals for renting out a whole theaters. Really? Yeah. For like, you know when, when we used to work at a movie theater, they used to print them out for like businesses to show like videos and stuff like that. I've seen that. Yeah. I've seen those ads they have, if you get to the movies too early before the previews start, they have like the previous to the previews and those like show like, like how you can use it for like conferences and stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          01:12:24       Yeah, they got a lot of, uh, a lot of extra business there. They always have those, um, like, you know, come to the theater to watch a live streaming of an opera fc. Yeah, we've done a couple of UFC. UFC does it. What's his name? Did it? The Fox News Guy. A Glenn Beck. He'd do his concerts that way. I want to talk to him so bad. Huh? He's one of my all time. All time. Need to talk to guys. I would love to talk to him like in a format like this, like one of the beautiful things about the podcast is not just that the podcast is on iTunes available for free, but that it's Ustream and it's live. This is live. This is you. This is the real Doug Benson. This is no, but there's no editing. Should really do some vaporizer hits then. Yeah. If it's just a real duck show how real.

Speaker 6:          01:13:10       We talked about some parties, ladies and gentlemen, the crackling you hear is plastic right now. Doctor drew is rolling in his lab coat. I ran into Dr drew at that April foolishness thing and he was with his kids and I think their fans. Oh, that's hilarious. Shit. That's hilarious. You need to find out. You should have asked a very bluntly, I'm sorry you fans of mine, I don't mean to be rude. Do you know who I am? They seem like they were pretty receptive to be there. And then they saw my set and I at that show I just, it was wall to wall pot and uh, Kevin and being said they'd never seen and you know, they've been around a lot of musicians and they said they'd never seen anybody as high as I was at night. You were so fucking high in Toronto and when you came in Toronto we were a, Doug did a last minute guest that you were just like go out there and do something. So I guess bike 10 minutes of the, the, the album, I just record it. I couldn't, I couldn't begin to come up with any new stuff that you were too big or riff too much. I, I'm sure I riffed quite a bit, but I, I kind of stuck to a plan when I got out there. I didn't, I didn't go out there and thinking like, oh, I'll just go out and

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       see whatever happens. You know, there's too many people. How was I going to do this bit and this bit, you know, I wrote it all down right before I went to hell. Did you really? Yeah. Yeah. Do you ride a lot? I mean he's here every day. Something you do a week on a terrible, I never sit down to write. I just, when I think now, especially with Twitter, if I think of a joke favor, it's relatively quick. I just throw it on Twitter. And if it's more of like a a story or a, you know, a longer bit, then I'll just try it the next time I do a show, you know, like a lot of my shows now I just start off with, hey, so here's what I did today. You know, I just sort of talk about whatever. And then, cause then you always know you got the jokes ready to go when it's time and that you'll be able to finish strong.

Speaker 5:          01:14:50       But it's fun to just be able to, I know I write a lot. I write a lot of long. Yeah, you're really intense in that way and it's a, it's amazing, especially considering what you're about to do right now. That's, it's ready. Jiffy pop is ready. I wonder if it's possible for the bag to explode. I've never had that out and it was never happened. Slowly. Slowly leaks. You know what, sue sisters, your idea. So I want you to take the throne. Fair enough. I think the hardest part for me is fine. I like, I'll think of it like a one bit like a tweet joke that I want to make it into a whole joke, joke, joke, and it's hard to take, you know, just a small little idea and make it a big joke. Like I have this thing that happened actually happened to me the other day.

Speaker 5:          01:15:29       I think it's Hilarious, but I need to build off of it. I can just say that and be like, ha ha, that's it. You know? Well, you know what man, the war of art is a brilliant book by Dr Steven Pressfield. Dr Steven Pressfield, I just give them a doctorate. Hunter, ricks Thompson. We go in the right way. We're not going anywhere, bro. It's all good. We've got plenty of weed. You know what I'm saying? When people always get like, no, it's this way. No of the biggest hassles are man, the guy who was holding the joint and wants to start his fucking story. Oh yeah. Oh my God, that's the worst. Or your dog eats or all your weed or your dog's got an excuse. He's a fucking dog. The Guy, the guy who holds the joint is go, Oh man, you wouldn't believe this man.

Speaker 5:          01:16:16       Right? So he's got his joint joint in his hand. There's a circle like 10 people. He's like, so I owe the student loan, right? I just supposed to take care of it and like my uncle was supposed to and and you're like Japan, that joint, you fucking jump in right away when I see that comment because he's holding you hostage holding on to anymore. And that's a great thing about what I love about smoking circle is everyone can just chat the whole time. You could be getting high having conversations. Then it's the only time where you go lip to lip on something and another man has it. You don't even flinch. Yeah. Yeah. Your immune system must be awesome. Or are you just have the best aids? All these aides are fighting it out for battle inside your body. You get tested. Every aids ever. I had a really good winter and I didn't even get my, I usually get a flu shot of all three types of toxo inside. You didn't get around to my flu shot and I didn't and I didn't get sick much though. The whole

Speaker 6:          01:17:09       winter I lucked out. But yeah. You know what man, this was a, I had one cold this winter and it was quick as fuck and I, I believe it was some sort of a flu and it was really quick. I go, you know, I'm like 24 hours sweating and shitting. As soon as something comes on, you know, like I just like him just in the sauna or you know, or on the floor drinking a lot of fluids. So you'd believe in sweating and everything on the toilet. I just, yeah, just get it. Same thing with a really bad hangover. I just want to like get rid of it. Like I love being hung over like in a nice hotel in Vegas because they always have, uh, you know, full blown steam room. You should go, you should be careful when you're sick about working out. A lot of people used to think that work, he would sweat it out of you, but that's not real.

Speaker 6:          01:17:53       And you, when you, if you have a real workout, it's one thing is like just gently moving and slowly kind of breaking a sweat that's just kind of getting your circulation going. But whenever you stress yourself, like if you like breathing heavy and you're like really pushing, you weaken your immune system, super dehydrated on top of all that. Yes. Yeah, we usually are. When you have a hangover, is it crazy? Yeah. You gotta be careful. I drink a ton of water, that's for sure. That's the huge one. The water is the most important thing and you kind of take fucking vitamins, man. And most likely you're not getting what you really need from your food unless you have a super clean diet. You need some vitamins. I'm putting out, I'm with Chris from on it. Chris Marcus, we're going to put out this neuro a formula. Nootropics.

Speaker 6:          01:18:31       Have you been taking it? Dude, I've been taken, dude. I've been taking it do if you've been taking it. You know what I noticed right away where the first day I had a really hard time sleeping. Yeah. I was lying in bed and my brain was flying and my dreams were super vivid and he told me not to take it before I went to bed. He told me to take it uh, earlier and I took it to like two in the afternoon, but I was still jazz that in my mind and one in one in the morning. Yeah. Have you noticed that? I, yeah, I've been staying up. I'm always staying up like that. So yeah, you're like, well, you have this crazy tweeting in the middle of this really loose schedule that most people would really kill for. Most people hear about you on Twitter just like, God.

Speaker 6:          01:19:09       So loves to just be able to sleep. Everybody that calls me in the morning or rights to me in the morning, it's like, sorry I know you, you know you're probably not up. And I'm just like, well you don't really know me then because I um, I get up early all the time because you got to catch a flight, you got to do vulner getting to do an interview, you get whatever. Like I have to get up early so often they're like, I've totally become a morning person. You know, I have a hard time doing interviews in the morning. My brain just don't, doesn't fire that good. Like when I get up and I go somewhere and then like you get in the car and then you get to the radio station, then I'm woken up. But like when I just wake up and then like the first words that I say are on the air, you have to get on the phone right away. Oh God. I feel like such a retard. I like struggle to talk, you know, but that works for me. So, you know, like they, they, it gets laughs if I'm having trouble trouble expressing myself, you know, and they, cause that's the morning radios. The worst there was like, oh stoner I had to get up at 7:55 AM to talk to us and it's just like

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       went for a while preparing for all these crazy sound effects. Yeah. That's the only thing that bugs me about Adam Carolla's podcast. Adam, I love you. Stop. So I actually listened to it with those fucking size. I said listen to it the other day cause I asked Adam Carolla's podcast cause I haven't really, I just don't have time to listen to other people's podcasts right now. But I listened to it and uh, he uh, it was so retarded though. Sound effects were really bad times. They make me laugh. Yeah. It's like in the middle of like Adam is talking and then middle of it, then they have like a quote from a movie that didn't like, it was like what did, sometimes that is in the middle. It's definitely an art form. You know, it's hard to just,

Speaker 1:          01:20:46       you know, to have this whole, all these sound effects loaded in and pick one really fast. It's appropriate. But when they nail it, like I think they, they're pretty funny out with Howard Stern sometimes too. He, they're pretty, they don't do them a lot, but they do them. Yeah. When they do them, it makes me laugh sometimes just cause it's so oftentimes, it's just so odd to suddenly hear like, will Farrell, you know, these welfare all loud on a Corolla and him just yelling random things. It's pretty funny. You know what they have in house or in this morning I was listening to my car, they had a fake Arnold and it talking about the, uh, the divorce. Oh yeah. Oh my God. It was fucking good. It was so good. It was so good that I thought, Holy Shit, Arnold Schwarzenegger is going off. Like maybe I thought it was real.

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       I really thought it was real. It took me like 15 seconds. Then I take her whole dresses and like throw them on the bed and I shit all over them. That's what I was like, okay. He wouldn't say that. You know, it was like only me and my underwear. I get the stories I can't do. My lead guy calls him, they call him fake card on whatever your dresses and um, yeah. He called him afterwards. He called them fake Arnold. So while it was going on, man, it's like the fake David Letterman got, damn, that guy's good. That holy Shit. That guy's good. This fake Arnold is just as good man. He's fucking dead on. He's dead on. It's perfect. He's the fucking, you know, they asked him if he's ever going to get married again. Fuck you. Never again.

Speaker 1:          01:22:07       Arnold's getting divorced. He's like almost dead. It's almost dead. He's getting divorced. There's something much more sad about an old dude that gets divorced if like Ryan Reynolds got divorced and he like, who could blame the kid? He's got perfect bone structure. You're hung in there. As long as he could go get that pussy, go get it, Ryan. You know what the fuck the guys probably got a million chicks clawing at them 24 hours a day everywhere he goes. Just trying to peek at his abs, you know, God bless him for hanging in there. Even when scarlet Johannson for a year and a half. You know what I mean? You can't fault him. But when you hear Arnold and Arnold getting divorced now, he still has checks after no nothing, nothing. Just as squats and and beets and extra. It does become about the thing different from him. Like I'm sure he'll get like a lot of pretty girls that just want attention from him and Nardo and the last thing they'd want to do is he'll get stingily sleep with them. Broken bitches. He's going to get some girls who want to have some sort of a slice of, he's going to get the kind of chicks Gary Coleman

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       was getting. No, you're going to give me the way Gary Coleman, we're getting chicks Coleman and his whole act was to, Jasper had borrowed still a bad bar is still, you know, he'll get some times he very quietly made wiggle, wiggle ISED we will. Why legalized it? I'm not hating on him. I love him. I'm just saying, I mean, dude, Conan the barbarian was one of my all time fucking favorite movies and the would not have been the same. They've got a new Conan coming out and the dude looks normal, maybe very charming about most sports nigger movies because he, so he just didn't try to, you know, get an American accent, you know, he just is who he is, what his name is. He is like kindergarten cop is hilarious. His name is Swardson nigger. You know what I mean? He's an all time great movie star and his name is just for the most people totally on on PR spillable who the fuck knows how to spell that?

Speaker 6:          01:24:02       S. C. H. W. A. R. C. E. This new guy, g. E. R. This new guy's probably closer to what Conan really would look like if it was a guy who was the a sward around in real life. He wouldn't be built like Arnold Schwarzenegger. He would be built like an athlete who may want to see Thor. I taught already. It's awesome. You loved it. Fuck yeah, it was great. I have trouble with all the stuff in the home planet and I just couldn't, I couldn't let go and just enjoy it. I just want, I just wanted to see him get his hammer and started fighting with people on earth and wasn't it funny when the guy, when the guy from the government was like, uh, when they see that when you see the big robot, he's like, is that one of Tony Stark's robots? Which is a cute line. Why isn't the next thing he does is get on his cell phone and get one of Tony Stark's to robots to come take care of this giant robot that's clearly, clearly means to hurt people. Yeah. They bring him in. Yeah. What the fuck? Where's iron man when you need them? Yeah. Cause hell if that's what this is is it's just another setting up an Avengers movie where they're all going to be in it, but it's, it's, you know, it was a cute reference, but it's also like what, that's also a solution to your problem. Yeah, exactly. He's get Tony Stark.

Speaker 7:          01:25:08       It's like that Old Lord of the rings thing where they're on an AI dragon at the beginning of the, like the first movie like that drag him, took him somewhere or whatever. Yeah. And then it's like, why don't you just ride the dragon to get the ring, you know, why'd you have like all these other things?

Speaker 6:          01:25:21       He's just, I just completely checked out on all the Lord of the rings movies because I'm just such, not a, I'm not a fan of any of the mythologies, so I just was just like watching it just for the pure spectacle of it each time and like I couldn't, I could barely tell you about anything that happened in those movies. My Dad and my Stepdad was a hippie and a, he loved all the Rro token jr tokens. I read a bunch of them when growing up. I read that stuff when I was little and I just never, it's, it's, you know, like Mike to Genre that can work, but it's like my least favorite. Like I'm not excited about this game of Thrones thing on Hbo. I've tried watching it and it's, what is it about? It's just, you know, that kind of the middle earth, you know, uh, did they have dragons fighting fantasy thing?

Speaker 6:          01:26:03       They have dragons in the game of Thrones. Thanks. So yeah, really, I certainly talk about him. They talk about genetics, a lot of talk and there, you know, and it's got sex in it cause it's HBO and, and you know, but I just, I always end up like every episode, I haven't gotten through the whole thing without checking my Twitter or you know, doing something else while it's on, you know, whatever I think about sex and old, any, anything Victorian era and you just got to know how bad those fucking people must have smelled back then. Got The worst, the worst, their ass hole. And then they don't like have more sour expressions on their face all the time. Like, oh my God, it's so [inaudible] smells like urine this everywhere in this castle using capitals like an asshole. You think that people were like dogs back then?

Speaker 6:          01:26:45       It didn't bother them. Oh, maybe they just get used to it. Yeah. I mean maybe there's something thinking, well you know you get used to smells. That's the weird thing about smells like a new sound like or sound rather. You can have like, they'll stay that way forever, it'll drive you crazy, but if there's a shitty smell you're, you're all factory sensors are only set up to detect changes in smell so you can get used to some sulfury nasty smelling neighborhood. You can get news. That's why when you drive through New Jersey and there's some areas in New Jersey where it's fucking so badly polluted by plants, by whatever chemical plants they have there so badly polluted, the air fucking stinks. I know for males, I don't know if it's that way anymore, but I remember when we were kids and I was, I lived in Newark.

Speaker 6:          01:27:27       We would drive through certain areas and it fucking stunk. Whenever it drove up the up the coast here through Santa Maria, it always, is that a cow area? It might, it's either a cow area or I people used to always say paper mill because it would smell Smith's smell like, like you know, really bad farts. How bad is that for those poor fucks that have to work there? I guess they do get used to it, but maybe it's chemicals. Right. Have you ever been like eating a tuna tuna canning place or something like that? No, that's the smell is insane. I had to hang out on one day when I was uh, standing in a for a movie. Uh, they shot a scene in a real like fucking tuna cannery down in Long Beach and is supposed to be a period piece and the place still looked like hell, you know, so it still looked like it was all dose Gary and a man that, that, that, that place smelled so bad and just hundreds of workers is that they're just, you know, putting their hands in it and smelling it all day long.

Speaker 7:          01:28:22       We've been to an Asian grocery store. There's one out here in Northridge that I went to recently. And it cause you probably seek out Asian grocery stores so you could tell this story. No, I mean like have you ever been into an Asian grocery store? Like you went in for cigarettes or something? No, I just went in to get candy and Japanese make great candy, but you walk in and it smells like fucking ass, just death of fish. It smells just like the grow. And they have like coolers, like on the ground of just live crabs and it's like crabs a dollar each and they're just like huge buckets of crabs. And then you go and there's like, you could buy like octopuses squids and they eat a lot

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       of freaky shit. Yeah. And there's just tons of fish completely like with their heads on and stuff like still alive, just in Saran wrap type thing. And they're still moving a little. You're just like, this is fucked up the creek. Where is this place? I got to check on receipt die in Northridge. We did fear factor in a, um, a slaughterhouse and that was pretty dark man. It was dark and smelled fucked up. It smelled. It's, it's like, uh, like, uh, a displeasure bill smell like you wanted to get away. And it was a clean place. They did a great, you know, I mean it was very cool. They even killed cows in a kosher way. There, there was uh, you know, they would slice her neck. There was of two different ways they would do them and one time they were doing when a rabbi was there and they would do it, would they have to, you have to do it with a sharp knife and slice the neck.

Speaker 1:          01:29:44       And so we had the weird stench to it and we had a guy go crazy there. It was one of the few times on fear factor was worried about my safety because this stunt was a guy had a dunk his head, everybody had a dunk their head in blood. We had this cow's blood and you had to keep the cow's blood at 38 degrees. It couldn't get any warmer than that because around 40, 41 degrees he starts developing bacteria like very quickly and you can get incredibly ill. So in order to do this, we had to fill these vats up with really fucking cold cow's blood. And this guy was like one of those Tony Robbins motivational guys. Like he had bought like motivational tapes and he had read books. And he was like repeating his mantra to him and he was standing outside. He was a big guy, man.

Speaker 1:          01:30:28       He was like a football player. He was yoked. It was a lot bigger than me, man. And he was standing in front of this, um, like a side view mirror on a pickup truck and he was talking to the mirror. He was like, you are a winner. You are a person who succeeds. You are a person who sets goals and accomplishing them. And he was pacing back and forth and then he would go back to that mirror and it would say it over and over again. And he was like all this positive affirmations. And then I was like, oh my God, this guy is crazy. And I just started taking off. Fuck, this guy is crazy. We've got a crazy guy in the show. How do you screen this crazy guy on the show? And so then he gets to the time where he has to do is stunt well, there's a bunch of people before him and they do it and girls do it.

Speaker 1:          01:31:07       All these people do it, but he does it. And he starts freaking out. He can't do it. He can't. He's choking, he's choking. You know the reason why it needs all this crazy motivational shit. He's got a fucking tornado of bullshit and his brain and it just wins every time something comes up and he just can't, he can't accomplish things. So he's in this fucking blood and he starts swapping the blood dot fuck, fuck. And he's screaming and he's covered in blood. And then I'm looking around and these camera man, and they all like smoke cigarettes. They're out of shape. And you know, there's like a little skinny guy. I was holding their core and I'm like, there's no security here. We've got a crazy guy covered in blood and I'm going to tell him that he's eliminated from the show. You just took care of me to the prom.

Speaker 1:          01:31:51       Exactly. Ready for fucking lightning bolts to come out of his eyes, the place to go on fire. And we all die in a Stephen King movie. I'd still, we're always think about the one episode where they blended the rat in the, in the blender and they had to drink liquid rat time magazine's 10 gross moments of reality television and we made it. Yes. Can you imagine doing that rat hair mixed with the melted phones? It's the only thing I don't like about reality. Television is the gross out factor is the best part. I'm a little crazy. And what's the best part? So I think the only thing worthwhile season, it wasn't for fear factor was the first time it wasn't for the beast. Yeah. I have obviously a very different take on it than the average person because I've been through so much. I've seen so much.

Speaker 1:          01:32:36       I've seen more gross shit. Any hundred people go, it's amazing what wife threw up in her car. Just fuck. She ate, she worked out and she'd drink wheat grass juice and she fucking puked all over our car, all over the console, over the seats, everything. And she was so grossed out by it and she's like, she's, she can't smell throw up. If she sells, smells throw up, she'll throw up again. I'm like, I'll clean it up. To me it was nothing. I'm like, I see so much puke. I was cleaning it up when I was a kid. I remember when you were a kid, you'd walk down the hallway and some kid threw up and everybody below you'd smell the throw up and you'd have to throw up. I could get right in and poke around in it like, like Molly and sculpture or whatever those Scully and Mulder with a, with a pencil.

Speaker 1:          01:33:15       I go look at that. There's a sausage. That's a hot dog. You would be. So you're completely unaffected by the pie scene and um, stand by while I was young back then. You know what I mean? That is so disgusting. I did once watching fear factor on television. I never threw up when I was actually there live when shit was going down. But there was a girl that was eating a cocktail glass full of worms and she was having the hardest time eating it. And I was telling her that she wasn't a flies. No, it was worms. And she would hit a mouth hole warms and she's chewing and she throws him up on this dirty picnic table. Okay. And I said, you can still win it. You can still do it. You just got to put them back in your mouth, put it back into Mt Mouth.

Speaker 1:          01:33:54       So she's, she's so grossed out by these worms that she can't even pick them up with her hands and put them in the glass. She's trying to pick them up with two glasses at the same time, and she's slobbering and snots coming out of her nose and she's crying and she's shaking and she's getting these two glasses together and like, you can do this, you can do this. You get it. She gets it back in her mouth and she chucks it up again. I go, come on, you've got plenty of time. Scoop that back up. And she did when she threw up the third time when I ran the sink and just hurled hurled into the sink. And I was like, this is so ridiculous. Like there live, I don't throw up but somehow or another watching it on TV, you should, um, you should isolate just the audio of that.

Speaker 1:          01:34:34       That fella totally sounded like the GNARLIEST, sexy. Come on, put it back in. You can win. You can win it. Come on, put it back yet they wouldn't even be near your big black wouldn't even be nearly the gnarliest. What's the gnarliest sex shit you've ever seen? That's really in the stumbling department. I'm really careful. Like God, I have a past with the trigger cause I like what I like and I can't stand seeing what I don't want. I don't like, you know what I don't want to see. So I, I've been really good about, you know, yeah. You have to in a certain surf around on the specific sites where they're not going to suddenly throw that stuff at me. Like the New York city.com or something like that. Or worldstar hip hop or no, Dean de nyc.com I think is the worst. It's one of the worst.

Speaker 1:          01:35:19       Not Daily motion. What's the one where there's lively, lively, lively. It's got some dark shit. Remember that we talked about on one of the podcasts, the girls with the high heels and the kittens crushing, they cannot hear about calls with the high. Yeah. I wouldn't want to ever see that. It's more kittens don't need to be crushed. Yeah. Kittens and puppies and shit like that. All that stuff. Talk to me about it. That's all that faces a death kind of stuff too. Like when people started describing it, I'm just like, I just totally tried to check out because anything that I can kind of remember, I'll access it at some point and he freaked out by it again. You know, it's good to know that it's out there though. You don't want to be naive. You don't want to think that people aren't capable of fucking heinous acts.

Speaker 1:          01:35:58       Like I used to have a real thing about serial killers, man. I read a lot of books on serial killers, a little watch, a lot of documentaries and part of it was just some morbid fascination by like the ice man or you know, a couple of other different ones like John Wayne Gacy and Ed gain who used to make lamps out of people and dresses at a women's skin. You know, when Gacy he was a clown, he dressed up as a clown and fucked and kills like a hundred kids and Bergen him in his basement or something insane like that. Why hasn't there been a comedian's Hillary or killer yet? The problem has probably has no way it'll will do. So like a known can be like, you know, not, well, not super well known, but well known enough to be able to do the circuit tour and then, you know, cause it, cause the charter flight for a serial killer would be moving around all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:36:41       Charles Fleischer murders, he's getting, he's got to go. It used to be in all these towns, you know, somebody eventually catch up to you, I'd imagine. Do you remember that one guy that got busted for rape? Yeah. There was a guy who was a kind of a serial rapist, do colleges and stuff. Vince champ. That's his name. Yeah, that was shocking as all hell because he was one of those comics. It was squeaky clean and all of his jokes were about boogers and stuff and then like, all right, and he's also a rapist. That's the ones who are going to watch out for like a guy like you. You kind of put it all out there, you know, he didn't have to worry about Doug Benson raping you. Yeah. Those guys with those squeezy says he's going to rape you. You know it's on and you should get reach for your car case.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       I think that you know a person who's not, you know who has like a really suppressed act. That's the bottles up inside of you if you're a freak. And a lot of these guys are, a lot of the clean people are really freaky. You know, I've, I know a lot of clean comics that go to hookers and shit and do a lot of weird deviant shit and their Sgo wiki clean on stage. And I'm like, it's almost like you need to blow off that steam. It's like, you know, you're onstage and you're so suppressed. Like you can't wait to go to the dark side as soon as you get the fuck away from people. Man, when you see some guys doing like a fucking a boat act, he's one of those crews guys. But it's really a, you know, on the other hand it can be marketable because

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       I think that as hilarious as they are, they're two of my favorites. Jim Gaffigan and Brian Regan, both are squeaky clean and that, you know, so families can go see them. You know, like I'll get the occasional weird family comes to check me out. But like, you know, I can't get all ages. You know, I got a bunch of family people were a guy with his kids that ran out of my show in Toronto and I feel bad. I'm sorry sir. I'm sorry. I did. I can't change the act for your kids. I didn't know you're going to bring 15 year olds and when they got up and split like I was doing during what bit jokes about fake babies getting their dick sucked.

Speaker 6:          01:38:32       That was it. I was trying to let them know it's not a real baby I made. It's all in my act. No real babies were blown during the making of any of my material. Yeah. Yeah. You got to say that right? You don't want social services knocking on your door, man. How'd you come up with is JB blower? How'd you come up with this joke? Um, but what were we talking about? The led into this? Did you drive around this joke? Um, I forget. I forget. You're talking on the side and then like the talking about rape area. Oh, squeaky clean. What happened? The Toronto, the guy, the people in Toronto, they just left and I heard about it later. He was very upset. Do you think he listens to this? No. I'm sure he doesn't. Maybe. I'm hoping they'll hear about, kind of know that that sort of stuff comes up.

Speaker 6:          01:39:13       Yeah. What do, we were talking about what's clean comic versus dirty comics that you could bring your family to Gaffigan show and to Brian Regan show. But the difference is that's how those guys really are. Like Brian Regan is one of the nicest guys I've ever met in my lightheart. Yeah. And he's always been like that. I've known Brian Regan since like 1992 or three I met him, I think I'm at, I'm at the Montreal comedy festival and he's always, he never preaches about like, he doesn't a lot of clean comics, you know, hold it over your head. Like I can, I can get big laughs without being dirty, you know, like they make a big deal out of it, but he never does that. He's super nice about it. It's so silly. That's so silly. Like, you know, I had Africans got a dark side, funny, funny Gaffigan does.

Speaker 6:          01:39:52       In what way? He just, you know, he, I know he likes hearing and telling dirty jokes. He's just chosen to be, could be clean because it's, you know, because he's good at it. Oh, I see. He's hilarious. It's almost like he's kind of forcing himself to Barite funnier jokes because he can't, you know, can't just throw in random f bombs and stuff. That's true. But I don't, you know, I think you can do both. I want it all. I don't like, I don't like rules. Like, yeah, like j Morgan tweeted one day, uh, you show me a comic with notes on stage and I'll show you the summit in somebody is not a real comic. And it's just like, that's silly. You know what, why can't you get notes? It's a performance style. Like if as long as the audience is getting as many laughs, you know what I mean? What difference does it make? Well, you know, not only that, what if you're working on some new shit, it doesn't mean it's not ready. It doesn't mean you have a bunch of other shit to go to, but there's a way to work on some new shit and you know, there's nothing wrong with having some fucking notes up there, man. As long as you're appreciative of the audience's attention span and you're not like, I don't like when people are going through their nose. No, no, no. It was not good enough.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Yeah. Yeah. I've seen some people do that and I don't appreciate it as a comic, I don't appreciate it. Forget about being a person who actually paid to see it. Yeah, but it's nothing wrong with notes. I don't give a fuck what you do. If it's funny, I don't care if you've got a guitar. I don't care what you do, man. I'm not. I think it's silly all that you know he's not a real this or you're not a real that stop it. Stop it. Yeah. I did and I don't know if it was Jay Morris said that it might've been, might've been carrot top lucky we didn't go off on Jay more carrot top says that to make props cooler, but at least I don't have notes. Yeah, you just have the joke written on each prop, afraid class that it was he picking up.

Speaker 1:          01:41:27       Somebody had a great point. Who the hell was it? That had a great point that he destroyed a whole genre. Yeah. There's no more prop comics. It's like you have to be carrot top to do it. It was Daniel Tosh, I credit Daniel Tosh. We were hanging out, uh, when we were doing the thing, we were, Daniel tosh gets punched by Manny Pacquiao. I was his corner man. And I'll try to talk him out of it. I'm like, do it. Don't do it. You're gonna get brain damage. Get out of this guy's one of the greatest ever and you've got to let them punch in the face. Are you fucking crazy? So he goes out and it was pretty funny and he did get hit pretty hard. But tosh pointed it out and he's like, there's no upcoming prop comes. He used to be a genre, like when we were open, Miker is used to be all that guy.

Speaker 1:          01:42:00       Oh, he's a guitar guy. Oh, that guy. He's a prop guy. Did that prompt, got jugglers? Magicians ventriloquists yeah, like there's, there's just one or none of all of them now. Jeff Dunham's the Ventriloquist, there's no famous juggler. There's no guy that's like, that's the guy that juggles, which doesn't even exist anymore. I wish Dunkin would bring back little Hobo, one of the greatest ventriloquist hacks ever stolen. Dunkin had a dummy called Little Hobo and he used to close with it. He had to close with it cause it was so crazy and outrageous that there was no room for it anywhere else. He had a, he had a finished with it and he, uh, somewhere where did it get stolen from San Francisco. We actually spoke to no room, a no from a comedy club, but Martha, fuck whoever you are, you piece of shit actually talked to him. He was like, you should do that again. That's a good idea. And so he made an impression.

Speaker 10:         01:42:46       Yeah. Hey everybody. Hi. That's a great idea. Hey Ari, how's it going?

Speaker 1:          01:42:52       [inaudible] word is that an orange wasn't cock sucker. What's what the questions? Yeah. Um, he's a, he's a great guy. Dunkin and that fucking puppet ACC was awesome. He used to do this pink Floyd song. Have you ever seen it? Ever seen his closer? Oh my god, it was genius. This is genius about say tannic puppet that killed his grandfather. It's gotta be on Youtube or, yeah, the gray. What it is is the grandfather leaves behind the puppet and the grandfather had one wish that he wanted to be buried with his puppet, but he wanted Dunkin to go onstage at the puppet the night before he was supposed to be buried and just give little Hobo one chance to say goodbye to everybody. So little hobos on stage with Dunkin and little Hobo starts confessing to the murder and then talking. It goes into a trance and starts singing pink Floyd.

Speaker 1:          01:43:38       Wish you were here. They both sing at the same time. It's fucking genius. It's so good. And he's a good ventriloquist. No, it's terrible. So there's a secret, but here's a secret. I can't, I can't tell how he does it, but it's really planned and the ending is fucking awesome. It looks so, so good. He couldn't follow it. Yeah, he used to have to, he used to have to close with it and I used to always carried around in this beat up suitcase. He's the, he's one of my favorite people. He's one of those dudes were,

Speaker 11:         01:44:06       no, he's going to come from some weird fucking angle. Like I could call Dunkin at three o'clock in the morning and it'll go, dude, I'm here watching ants in a death spiral. Here's ants on youtube. And apparently the fear Moans and some of the ants, they're following a smell, but the queen has died so they don't know where to go. So they're all going out and they'll go in that circle until they die. Fuck far out, man.

Speaker 1:          01:44:33       Those people you need in your life, man, you have to cultivate them. That's like, that's like the, the, the rare flower that grew in tangled, that kept mother Goethals alive. That's what it's like. It's rare to find though. It's good to have somebody that always you, you know they're going to amuse you. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a nice experience to be like, oh, I talked to this guy, he's going to say something funny. And that's what doctor drew doesn't fucking have in his life and bring this around full circle. We're coming into the home front folks. He's got so many comedians on his show that all smoke on love line that I had been on a bunch of times. I don't know this, this clip is a, I'm not saying it's not real, but I'm just writing. I'm just wondering, I'm not trying to start any conspiracy theories.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       You can Osama bin Ladin type shit son. I still think that um, that it's, he's kind of changed a little bit. It's Kinda like, you know, Trump, it's going to fall back on us. All of his opinions or just the, just a standard boiler plate. What you should say to please the GOP and he didn't used to feel any of those things and you still like, that's why you can't actually run, cause they're going to dig up so much stuff on him. It's just going to be like, what are you, hold on. Newt Gingrich thinks he can be president. You silly. Fuck Newt Gingrich, by the way, was cheating on his wife while they were having Clinton and parading him around on television for being an adulterer. Don't that whole time they were going after Clinton impeaching him. He was cheating on his wife. Yeah, but that's, that's the, that's what's changed is now they can go after somebody about a birth certificate cause they've got one of those. Yeah. They're not going to be a hypocrite. Fuck the fuck man. I'm not a racist. Newt Gingrich. You fucked up dude. You can't be king. No, you're going to have to accept that. Go write books. Go be bitter. Go drink at a bar somewhere and tell people could have been, but you can be really interesting to see if the Republican's come up with like their Obama if like somebody really catches fire out of nowhere. I know Sarah Palin's. Nice.

Speaker 1:          01:46:29       Yeah. Really. She loved the girl. He yelled out. My aunt is Sarah Pailin and I've got an inside scoop because I met her. That was the most obscure call back ever two hours ago and I've no idea what was happening then. I don't know who the fuck is going to run for president, but I, I would hope there would be at

Speaker 6:          01:46:49       least one option, like a Gary Johnson or Ron Paul, one person who has sense. One person who represents moderate people who just want to be left the fuck alone, not this ridiculous battle of left and right. That's not even a real, there's gay marriage or gun control and all these issues that they keep throwing up that that's, it's, they're all giant distractions while they rob you and fucking steal money left and right. No matter what we do, people are still going to have guns. People are still going to get abortions, but gay people are going to have sex with each other for real. People are gonna smoke weed. You know what I'm saying? All these things that they're fighting so hard to stop are not going away. Big Black Dick. When you realize that, you know, we have everything. There's people listening to this podcast or drunk as fuck.

Speaker 6:          01:47:33       I pulled off the Joe Rogan drinking game though. I do. Like I said, I was going to do every time Goldberg goes to take a pee, um, I tell people to take a shot. This is the Joe Rogan drinking game because Mike Goldberg drinks a ton of Red Bulls when we work together. And, uh, you know, he's, you know, he's fucking very professionally wants to be hyped up and he has to pay all the time. The record for him peeing during a a six hour broadcast is six times he gets, I don't pee at all. I sit down and sometimes if I can, like if like there's a break of like 20 minutes, like there's been a bunch of quick first round knockouts, I'll get a chance and then I'll run, take a, take a leak and maybe even grab a quick sandwich or something like that and then sit back down again.

Speaker 6:          01:48:10       Goldberg does it all the time in the middle of the show. So live on paper view. He runs to the bathroom and then runs back. So I told people that if you see the fighter walking and the fact that music is playing, but I'm the only one talking take a shot. Cause that means Goldberg's Peon and he actually said it on the last paper view. If you're playing the drinking home game at home, did Danny say anything about it? That is always a good two, three minute stretch to go pee because yeah, it's just a guy parading down the middle of the, the island. It's always exciting when you're there. And there's also the conversations, you know, like he's not gonna be able to handle my power. He's not gonna be able to do with my speed. This is a totally different kind of athleticism.

Speaker 6:          01:48:47       And then the other guy says, you know, I got more experience. I'm down, you know, I'm, I don't care. I'm ready to go to war. I'm going to die.dot, dot. And the music plays and walk up and the whole thing. Doug Benson is a big UFC fan and you went to a bunch of them. Yeah, because it's like they show you, they treat everything. They do it just the right way they like, and they show you everything you need to know about each of the fighters on the big screens. Then they'd come in to their own music that they've selected and they're all pumped up. And you know, in the case of Toronto, there was a lot of Canadian fighters. So the crowd was very much on the side of the Canadian in each fight and, but you just get so pumped up. It's like seeing a trailer for an action movie and then getting to see that action movie right away instead of having to go home and think about it like, like they really set it up.

Speaker 6:          01:49:27       They really make you want to see these guys fight and then you get to see them fight. And sometimes it's like amazingly quick. And that in Toronto there was every different kind of ending. If I could have, you know, things went to a decision. There was, there was knockouts, there was a choke out. There was a boring fight. Exciting fights. Yeah. Yeah. It really was all different kinds of fights. Fights are important for two reasons. One, they make you appreciate the exciting fights, you know, because there's going to be fights and there's going to be fights where guys, it's not that they're not good, it's just they cancel each other out, you know? That's really all it is. And sometimes when you got guys that are equally talented, it's a boring fucking fight, especially when they're really good. Grapplers like sometimes just nothing happens, but then the next fight will be some crazy fucking head kick knock out and you'll really appreciate it.

Speaker 6:          01:50:14       You know, just, yeah, nothing more exciting than the guy that actually ran up the chain link fence and kicked a dude and the Anthony Pettis that that they, I see that clip every time I go and it has, that is the most, that is like movie shit that is, that is only guys on wires making a movie can do that. Not only did he do it, he did it in the fifth round of a championship fight where it was neck and neck up to that moment. It was anybody's fight. Literally up to that round he was winning the whole round, but up to that round it was anybody's fight and he comes in with this crazy kick and knocks him down. He's the greatest kick I've ever seen in my life in Toronto. That guy was it hammock that had the had the Hematoma? Yeah. Somebody on Twitter said it passed.

Speaker 6:          01:50:56       It said it looked like a breast implant right after we were like elephant man or like it was horrifying. It was a restaurant. And right after I read breast implant I was like God why didn't I think of that? And he, but he almost came back from that. He all, you know, towards the end of the fight he really, it was very exciting because prior to that it was just watching a guy get punched in his hematoma was, it was brutal. Well apparently Joe say Aldo had a staph infection and that's why he looked great in the beginning of the fight but tired cause usually it doesn't tire. He's a, he's a fucking machine. And I asked him about it after the fight cause I knew he had a hard wait cut too. But he in his corner, apparently in Portuguese he said to one of his corner men something about the antibiotics.

Speaker 6:          01:51:34       Like I should've taken more antibiotics, has cornered, I said nothing. You defend your title, you did a great job, don't worry about it. And then afterwards they said that he had a staph infection and took an extreme dose of antibiotics to try to cure it as quick as possible, but thinks that, you know, he didn't really, it wasn't really 100% when he got in there. So, which is amazing cause hammock is a really bad ass dude and to be able to handle harmonic while you're fucking sick from antibiotics and a staph infection. Yeah. Yeah. But that definitely explains that last round. Like he really, you talking back but it was too late to, you know, to get the decision. Yeah. He just kind of held on the last run. He couldn't do anything. And that's not like him at all. If you look at his fight, like with Uriah Faber, you're right favors of beats and he beat the shit out of your Ira for five rounds and he never got tired.

Speaker 6:          01:52:15       I mean it was just a, a beating. It was a rye as a former champion and he just could not fuck with all, although it's just all over him and he never got tired. When you have a staph infection or if you're on any kind of antibiotics like that. I've had both. And it's a draining thing. It's your ads are going to be groggy enough from getting hit in the face. You don't need that extra. Yeah. Will you be like Shitty, slow feeling weak. Most people can't even wrap their head around. Would it be like to have to hit a bag for 25 minutes? You're fight five minutes. Yeah. Five minute rounds. Go hit a bag and the bag

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       doesn't even hit back. You would drop dead of a fucking heart attack. Like you have to be an incredible condition to pull that off. And then you add the fact that the other guy's hitting you and then you have the fact that you're wrestling and then you add the fact that you're, you're moving around and running after each other and fuck. And it's not a good time to be unhealthy. Yeah, exactly. But sometimes these guys, they're, you know, it's a title fight and there's a lot on the line and like this weekend is a perfect example. Gray Maynard was supposed to have the rematch with Frankie Edgar there for third fight in the last fight was fucking incredible. Just an amazing fight. The first round gray Maynard knocked Frankie Edgar down look at least three times and he was badly fucking hurt. It was crazy how it was so close to being stopped.

Speaker 1:          01:53:26       He was getting fucked up and then he won the second round and everybody went crazy and then it looked like Edgar was coming on and gray Maynard had blown himself out trying to finish them in the first round and it became a real competitive fight and got down to a draw. And so they're having a rematch. It was supposed to be this weekend, but gray Maynard or Frankie Edgar rather broke his ribs or s something happened, something happened. He had a pullout and they were going to offer gray Maynard Anthony Pettis. But Maynard said, you know what? I've got to tell you my knees fucked up too. I was gonna. I was going to gut through it just because it a title shot, you know, because of the chance to, we've got some time. So now he decided to step, but it just goes to show that he's willing to fight a fucking title fight with a Jack Knee.

Speaker 1:          01:54:05       You know, I mean there's these guys, they, you know, by the time they get through a six to eight week training camp, there's a lot of times they've got some significant shit wrong with them. You know, they're really shows up in fights, you know, fucked up knees, fucked up, back's fucked up next. Like Tiago Silva apparently fucked as backup so bad that he had to take something. I don't know what the fuck he took, you know, some sort of steroid or some performance enhancing drug. And he turned in like non human urine and they tested his urine and they're like, um, this is not only is it free of drugs, it's free of everything that would make you a person from a Chinchilla.

Speaker 1:          01:54:44       You didn't get pregnant. She says you're a Zombie. You know, but you know, it's, it's uh, you know, being close to those guys and being like, uh, you know, on the road with them and going to all these different towns and getting to see them train and getting to see them fight and getting to see good performances and bad performances. You're really wrap your head around what a massive commitment it is to be an MMA fighter and how fucking easiest to be a comic. It is. We're very blessed with a whatever it is that, you know, made us decide to do this because it's um, you know, and you can do it till you die. I mean, people, most people are as scared of getting up and speaking in public as we are of getting punched in the face. I've done both and there's no comparison. I was scared before I went on stage. I was more scared than I was before I would fight. Yeah, it's true. It's amazing that difference. You know, because that was only once, once I did it and then I realized I was like okay I was never in those cases everyone would fight and everyone will be a comic if both weren't scary. Yeah, they're, they're definitely

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       scary things. But it's just fun. It's funny to me now like cause cause people, I'll be sitting having a drink at the bar right before I'm supposed to go on and nobody would be like are you nervous or do you have to prepare? And it's just like not really. I'm even drinking and smoking weed outside. Like I just go out there and you know, I haven't done a show where people wanted their money back cause I was too fucked up. But you know it's, it's a, it is an easy thing to do if you know, if you, if you do it all the time. Joey Diaz says it best. He says the hardest, easiest thing you'll ever do. Yeah. And that's really what it is. Once you, once you get it, once you're locked in and if you're in the groove it's super easy. But if you're out of the groove, like if you go up in a bad state of mind, like have you ever had like a real, like you go, fuck, I shouldn't have gone on stage.

Speaker 6:          01:56:26       I should've, I should've tooken a night off. Have you ever had where you were emotionally kind of in a bad place? Yeah. Like you know, I maybe a little more prone to snap at people for being douchey in the audience because you know, it just wasn't in the right, you know, I kind of, I'll go into it sometimes a little negative like, oh, okay, I could tell this was going to be a noisy crowd and the, and I'll let it get to me when I could just, you know, try to ignore it, you know? No, but I'm, what I mean is like, have you ever had a where you're emotionally fucked up, you just went up there and you just couldn't be funny and just weren't funny and just couldn't feel it because I don't know why you, you're talking about, no, no, but I'm ridiculous like that.

Speaker 6:          01:57:00       I can, I can understand that that happening. Like, I certainly, but it's not you. I didn't do standup comedy for like a week after nine 11. Like I, that was a period of time where like if I went on stage, I just feel like it would feel wrong and, and uncomfortable. But fortunately people didn't want comedy, you know what I mean? They waited a little bit. But then once, once I got back on board, it was a great feeling to make people laugh, uh, under those circumstances. You know, it was like, it was a good, it was therapeutic for me and the audience. Right. But you've never had a moment where you were in a shitty place and you went on stage and because of you being in a shitty place, he just ate it. No, I just eat it on my own and then, and then, you know, they'd get mad at them if they don't like it, but I, I can't really blame it on, you know, like I'd imagine that there's, there's gotta be some sort of, are you hinting it?

Speaker 6:          01:57:49       Have you had an situation that, I've had a couple of the best ones I've ever heard. Those are into, something would happen to Ari. Ari Ari had a girlfriend that uh, he uh, was upset that she was hanging out at the comedy store after they broke up. It was really upset how they broke up and it just, it was, it was hard on him. This is a heartbreaker and she was hanging around the comedy store and he threw a glass of ice water on her head and everybody got mad at them and there was like, dude, you know what the fuck? And then our, he tries out for last comic standing and this girl is one of the judges for last comic standing. I was wondering if it was her and there's only three people in when the last comic standing judging is really not stand up comedy really never. There's never any other situation where you have to do standup for three people in a room. And if there is, you should, you should run. Yeah, it's gross the way they do it is gross. I don't agree with it. I think

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       it's cruel. It's cruel bee. A little melodramatic. It's weird. It's weird. It's weird. Weird. It doesn't have anything to do with like becoming a stand up comic and they can, or being a good one. The eight K it's influenced by Simon Powell. I was there for last comic standing, the original, the original series, the first season rather I was one of the judges and when we judge comics, they were in front of a crowd and they got a crowd to perform in front of and we voted them in or out and it was that simple. Then somewhere along the line they got the sort of Simon cowel thing going on where they want to see the shitty additions, they want to see the shitty auditions and they want to interrupt people and be funny, like cutting them off. And so Aria has no idea that she's one of the judges and he goes out there and just was totally unprepared and didn't know what and just ate shit and just dry brick.

Speaker 1:          01:59:30       Plonk plonk that's the worst one I've ever heard. My worst one was, uh, I was in a gas station on my way to the comedy store and it was two weeks after Phil Hartman had died. And I hadn't gotten on stage yet and I was the first time going on stage back and Nope, no, it was the second time I'd gone on stage the night before and it went okay. But it was shaky, you know, but I was, I was thrown and I knew that people when they are introduced me say that he's on news radio. I knew the people in the audience are going to go, oh, it was not there where that guy got murdered by as quite of your top of mind problem. And it's why I blew, blew her brains out and he's a big fucking story. Um, and so I'm on my way to the comedy store and I pull into the gas station and it's dude that I knew from Jujitsu is a cop and he sees me and we started talking and he tells me that he was there and he tells me that his buddy broke into the house because Phil Hartman's wife had the kids in the bathroom and she had a gun and she had already killed fill and she was going to kill the kids.

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       And that's what you know, that's what a mother does. If a mother is going to commit suicide, a lot of times if they're, they're that desperate and they're that fucked up, they were about to go, they're going to kill her kids to it. They didn't want the kids. So the guy kicks down the door because they know that she's got a gun and the kids run away from their mother. They run from their mother pulling away, screaming, run from their mother. They get out of the bathroom and she blows her fucking brains out. Boom. Cops in the house, kids running from her and she blows her brains out. And I went on stage an hour later and there was no way I can be funny. It was impossible. It was impossible. And I was saying the jokes right, I was, I was trying, the words were coming out in the correct order, but there was no way I could be funny.

Speaker 1:          02:01:16       It was, it was, there was nothing there. And I, even at the end of the show, I said something, I said, I'm sorry I shouldn't have got onstage. I found out some shit right before I went on stage and I couldn't not think about it when I was up here and I apologize is terrible side. I'm sorry. I'm just bring up the next guy and hopefully he won't suck as bad and I brought up the next guy and I just fucking got out of there. Drove home crying. That was, that was the worst. That's intense.

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       Yeah. I'd wished that guy wasn't there at that gas station. I really didn't want to know that. Yeah, yeah. No, that's, that's way too much. Yeah, and I'm not high anymore. Yeah. That's a buzz kill, right? Wow. We'll have to fire back up. Five 21 oh it's the end of the show. What a downer. Should we end on this downer? Do you have anything happen? Oh, that's pretty heavy. Shoot yourself up tonight at sounds. Comedy Hall or not. Maybe we're just going to carry that thought. I'm going to be in mom tonight. I'm going to be sorta near the White House and somebody is asking me if I wanted to do a tour of it. Whoa. And I'm like, do they let people use the bathroom and the White House? I don't know. I'd love to take a shoe thing. There's cameras in the, in the bathroom, in the White House. That'd be weird.

Speaker 6:          02:02:20       What do you mean has to be on stage as I'm trying to stall would get, I would imagine there has to be cameras in the bathroom of the White House. Even in like while you're sitting on the crapper, I think there has to be cause you otherwise you can be, you know, you could go in there and take off your jacket and start putting together a gun that you've got pieced of little, little tiny parts all throughout your jacket. You screw it together. You're went out and ice everybody. I think you have to go through a metal detector day. Give you maybe have a plastic gun first place, maybe a plastic gun. Your boat with a man. I have some sort of special metal. It doesn't get detected. Maybe picked my fucking watch doesn't go off when I go through my wedding ring. My watch is this.

Speaker 6:          02:02:52       I could make something out of this watch and fucking cut you open with it. This is ridiculous. It's metal. Well it's some metals that works and some metals that doesn't all the TSA rules right. Drive me crazy cause I just like, like you can have lighters in your checked bag. I mean in your, in your carry on but you can't have lighters in your checked bag, which that doesn't make any sense to me. I fly with a lot of lighters cause you know how I am either people or giving them to me like as a present or I'm just actually walking away with people, lighters and I, so I always have a bunch of my bag coming back from Canada, from Toronto. They pulled me aside and said you've got too many lighters and I was like too many. And they go, yeah, you can only have one.

Speaker 6:          02:03:32       And so they made me throw out like four lighters. But it was really funny because he's like you have too many letters and they're like yeah there might be a couple in there. And they were like, here's one, here's what they're like pulling all these liners out. And one of them was a Mary Louise Parker. It was like a one of those flip lighters, you know the a and M had a picture of Mary Louise Parker looking all sexy from weeds on it and then, and engraved in the back, some stuff about you're such a great stoner when it, and the guy stood there in front of me and read it. He read it and then he's like, well, which one do you want to keep? And I said, I'll, I'll keep that one. I'll keep doing what the engraved one and I threw away for stupid bics or whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:04:06       But uh, what, what does that, what are those, why are those rules different from country to country? Like they should just be standards that are set up and they should, you know, make some sort of sense because Hannah has got a lot of interesting rules. You can't even get in there if you have a Dui. Really when they run your Id, if you have a Dui, they say you can't come into the country. Sorry, Douche bag. That's not a bad idea. It's great idea. It's one of the reasons why Canada is so fucking cool. I had no idea though that, I mean I don't have a Dui but uh, if I had one I would have still tried to go to Canada. Like you don't find out to get there. Right. Yeah. Thank you. Can make your reservations and stuff. We'll even if you get off of something sometimes it shows up on your record.

Speaker 6:          02:04:44       Eddie Bravo had a gun charge cause he got pulled over once and he was legally carrying a gun cause he worked for a check cashing company and uh, he told the cop, you know, you have to tell a cop, a cop pulls you over. I'm sorry. Just tell you officer, I have a loaded gun. So they handcuff him, throwing the back of the car. They run his plate, they run the whole thing. Okay. You're legally carrying his gun, go back to work, take care. But that just the fact that he was arrested shows up and every time we go to Canada I said get away from me dude. You go up there on your own because if I get stuck with them, I'm stuck for fucking hours. Man. Stuck for an hour and a half, two hours. We tried to drive across the border with Tommy Chong runs

Speaker 6:          02:05:22       from uh, from Seattle into Vancouver and they just, you know, they searched the car within an injured dog. That car got so raped. It was a, it was a long stretch limo too. So it was kind of embarrassing like how many you seats and stuff they had to pull out, but they were super friendly to him the whole time. Never searched any of our bodies like a, you know, we've realized after we left that to one of my friends, Tony had a joint in his pocket the entire time until, wow. Those kinds of moments are just like he would, if he didn't know he had it on him, he wouldn't have been able to pull it off. Yeah, right. He just said he just thought he didn't have any weed on him, so they were like, get out of the car or come stand over here. And we're just saying, we just stood around and they'd, you know, they ran all of our passports and so again, lucky I didn't have a DUI and that's how much that we, that guy smokes kind of like unknown joints and get out of his body.

Speaker 7:          02:06:15       Let me what my book bag I, I traveled last time I traveled I had a bowl and weed in it from Portland because so many fucking people gave us weed and it Joey d is, is putting weed in my book bag. Everyone who's given me weed and

Speaker 6:          02:06:26       you that at the airport and got a search your shit for weed before you fly. Yeah. Don't be putting weed in your luggage ever. You're not going to find weed my luggage to go ahead and look a little bit. I'm just saying just because it's my understanding that it fits in your checked bag. Like if you put it in a sock or something that uh, you know, the worst is going to happen is the guy who finds it just takes it for himself. Really. I wouldn't try that shit going to Canada. No, no, no, no. Not Out of the country. I'm talking domestic. I still wouldn't try that shit. It's not worth it. No, it's, it's smart not to and you're beautiful. You're lucky like me. You go somewhere and make one phone call or something or write one tweet and the find out where the weeds at.

Speaker 6:          02:07:06       Yeah. You find out where the cops are at third tweet and hey man, come meet me. My Burger King cops so don't care. There's no sting operations for existing operations for high school, Bro. Like us. Don't. They don't ever harass us is what I'm saying. That's true. But how many dudes in high school were gone, Bro? You're fucking paranoid. These people are not undercover cops. Meanwhile, they were, could you imagine they were getting high and they go, dude, I think Billy's an undercover cop. Get the fuck Outta here man. No undercover cops. This is high school in Florida. Nobody gives a fuck man too. I'm telling you for 40 year olds just transferred into our school and it turns out they all really need weeds. How we're going to help them out because you know, it's hard to be 40 and in high school and need weed.

Speaker 6:          02:07:50       Yeah. Meanwhile, by the way, Florida is like the number one pill place in the whole country. It's the easiest place to get pills. We've talked about it before and we'll bring it up again for it. It doesn't have a database. You can get oxycontin's all over the place in Florida because you can get a prescription and it didn't go down the street to another doctor and say, my back hurts. And he writes you another prescription and you go to another doctor. You can keep doing it all over Florida. People do it all the time. There was a vanguard show and episode of, uh, uh, called, um, the oxycontin express all about, you can find it online if you're interested. Just, just Google the oxycontin express and it's all about the law. The hard words to spell and you're telling me boxy content. We'll just throw it in Google. It will say, did you mean this? And it'll clear you up. But uh, yeah, man, pills are a lot more, more fucking now. I kept one commercial that the drug free America did where they showed like the dealer on the corner talking about will you should, you know you should keep your kids away from the medicine cabinet before you keep him away from me. Like that should be a bigger concern. Yeah, no shit. Cause it's right there under their noses and you're gone all the time.

Speaker 6:          02:08:51       I'm getting, you know, he's like, I'm not going to be out of business because of drug medicine cabinets. I wish, I wish we could get through the doctor drew that if Dr Jay was talking about this kind of, if he's taught, call him up. I was talking about, but this is going after narcs that are arresting high school kids for we'd look, I don't know why he thinks that's a good idea. First of all, when you're a high school kid, yeah, you're going to make shitty choices. You're gonna make bad decisions. You're in high school and if you're selling going to try stuff, you're supposed to take the wheat away from the kid and go stop. You're not supposed to have undercover cops pretending to be students wandering the halls trying to buy weed. They should be. And they should be trying to stop adults from selling stuff like that to children.

Speaker 6:          02:09:34       That's what they should, that's what they undercover thing should be, is they should pretend to be dealers and get involved with those other dealers. And, and that's, yeah, it's a minor them out. Weeds, a minor issue folks. The real issue is pills and heroin and meth and all that creepy shit that ruins limes. Weed's not ruined your life. It's just not, I don't buy it. I didn't even start until I was in my late twenties. I was 30, 30 years old, almost 31. Yeah. And I never, when I was a kid, I never was loud. I was like a big fan of Cheech and Chong, you know, had their albums, listen to them and never even thought to try it. It just seemed like, oh, it's fun laughing about this. Uh, you know, he's crazy. He had dug adult. What got you to take her other comics really sane improves.

Speaker 6:          02:10:15       Really. So did they like talk you into it or did they say did you want to try it? They're just like lets smoke, smoke some pot. And they were both into it. So I was like I'll give it a, you know, I'll give it another world because I was one of those same thing happened to Willie Nelson supposedly where like the first time I tried it once in high school I was like one of those people have walked around and going, oh it didn't do anything, you know, didn't do anything for me. So you know with Shitty weed or I didn't already has a friend. We're legitimately doesn't work. Yeah. I've seen him smoke crazy amounts of weed and nothing happens or it doesn't do anything. Yeah. But Michael Michael, Ian Black is like that. Really? Yeah. Cause he said I really want to get high, get me high.

Speaker 6:          02:10:50       And I was, we were in Seattle so I had good weed and I watched him smoke a ton of it and then he was just like, no, nothing. You haven't tried to use it because it's a bit like, you know, you're pretending that you're not high. And, uh, I don't know if he's done edibles. I don't know if he's tried that. I'll ask him sometime. But he, yeah, he's kind of like just a, he's just built a certain way that he doesn't, it doesn't affect him. So did you go right from being a guy who never smoked weed to just fucking full on stoner? I was know as Moochy Moochy admin for a long time. Like I only smoked when it was around, you know what I mean? Like I, and I hung around a lot of comics, so they hooked me up a lot, you know?

Speaker 6:          02:11:25       And I think that at a certain point I started to think, oh, I should contribute, you know, because this is just rude and I'm smoking more, you know, I want my own and I want to be able to share and, and so then I, you know, but I think when did you first ramped up? Pretty quickly? I think just because of being on the road all the time. You know, this was when I was like a feature act. So what year is this we're talking about? I have no idea. I could trying to get at was La, was it, you'd have to buy pot from dealers or are you going through the medical system? No, I had dealers it medical system. He hadn't started yet. And then once it did, it took me years to catch on. Like I didn't get involved in the medical system until, uh, making super high me really, because I always, I always had good dealers that were like, you know, I had this one guy that would just drive it right to my house.

Speaker 6:          02:12:13       You'd always just get whatever you get. Like he just give you an eighth of something awesome. But, uh, you know, and it was pricey, but I was working, you know, it was working and could afford it. And so it was never really, like, for the first few years of medical marijuana, I knew some people that were like, oh, you gotta do it. It's amazing. But like, until you step into one of those places you really don't get. And that's part of what I love to show in that in the movie Super Jaime, is that, you know, people in other states are just blown away that, that, that, that exists and that you just go in there and shop for. We'd like that in such a relaxed environment. I know, it's amazing. And um, yeah, so, um, but once I got into the medical thing, now I'm really into that.

Speaker 6:          02:12:54       But, but prior to that I just had a, you know, different dealers, you know, one that got robbed and kind of hurt one time that, that kind of sucked, you know, like really? Yeah. I mean I definitely, once I figured out about medical, I was happy to make the leap, you know, because I think people that are dealing or just like, they're taking too many risks, you know? That's, that's my leading thing about legalizing marijuana is just the incarceration of people that have anything to do with it. You know? That's, that's like, that's where I think that's the main thing I'd like to see happen first because with medical marijuana and Arnold Schwarzenegger and making it a like a misdemeanor citation, a bull offense, uh, I'm not too worried about getting to smoke.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       I don't really need it to be legal for my own personal sake. I want it to be legal for the, you know, the black guy that get, gets pulled over and has some in his pocket. Right, right. Yeah. Well it is decriminalized now in this state. Yeah. And now the gym is like a hundred dollar ticket or something. Yeah. If the bigger ticket, if you smoke a cigarette, really Burbank, it's a suburb and it's like a two or 300 Burbank is above the law. Burbank's robots do it. A lot of crazy stuff. Why show Sunday at flappers at four 20. Oh, that's right. Let's wrap it up with that. That Joe Rogan might might appear. I'm going to try, I'm going to try to make it, cause I think I land that morning. Um, I'm pretty sure. All Right Ladies and gentlemen, that's it. That's the on the podcast tonight, we are going to be at Sal's comedy whole.

Speaker 1:          02:14:11       Did you get this? If you're in la, go to sales comedy whole dot. Come and work your way through that shit hole of a website. So you find the reservation page and click on some link and I think you can enter in a credit card or something that went there at eight o'clock. It's small place, but it'd be Doug Benson, Sam Tripoli, Thompson, Gora. Um, this weekend, Sam triply and Thompson Gora and me are at Cobbs and that's three headliners, man and Salmon, Sam. And I'm a Thompson. We're at both fucking hilarious if you never seen them before. So it should be a killer show, like four and a half headliners. I think I liked the way you think. Um, the Saturday night is sold out. I think there's just a couple of tickets left Friday and a couple of tickets left Thursday as, as far as the beginning of this podcast, uh, it might all be sold out.

Speaker 1:          02:14:54       We'll see you guys there. And, um, uh, next week, uh, I'm going to be doing a movie, so no podcast. And, uh, so I'm going to try to get some people from the movie and on the podcast I'll try to interview them and Bas Rutten's going to be there and maybe interview him again too. But, uh, I'm gonna do my best to get you guys some shit, but there won't be any Ustream ones. So that's it. And we go a live on serious May 28th. So a, that's it. All right. It's working. Show's over. I love you bitches. Sure.

Speaker 2:          02:15:29       Okay.
