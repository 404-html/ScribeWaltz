Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Alright ladies. Gentleman, mike birbiglia is here. Why waste time by fuck around. We are here to the music,

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       the joe rogan experience podcast all day. Birbiglia easily the most prepared standup comedian gassed in the history of this podcast. Look at this. Homeboy has got page after page after page. He also has printed stuff. He's got it. You're. You're wriTing out in longhand, so one of the last humans to use cursive. It's all insanity though. It doesn't add up to anything really, but it does. You know, it adds up to effort,

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       right? Like all that is making sure you're writing things down and puts it in your brain. That's what a short documentary about lynch often mitch hedberg and one of the things that he says in this old interview is like he got people them for advice all the time, young comedians, and he just says like, write down what's funny. Don't be lazy. Don't be lazy. piece of advice. Right. Especially from a heroin addict. It's very rare that you get like non lazy heroin addicts. I mean, look, I don't make me laugh at that. It's not funny, but it is true and I think it's important to talk about because it's why he's not with us anymore. He's one of the greats. He is, in my opinion, he is one of the most incredibly rich guys of all time. He was so good and so clean. Super clean. yeah. Which like for no reason it was so inventive. Mind was so inventive. Yeah. He was a really unique comic, but he also had a problem with heroin. He had some drug issues, it seemed. I'd say that never your office. Who am I to say? I never. I was friends with mitch, I never saw him use drugs. That's true. Well, I was friends with mitch and I never saw him use drugs either, but, and, and um, I saw him. yeah. Nice. I'm the final week, uh, and it's just, it's very sad. Well, when

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       stan hope and I were working together on the man show, the bastardized second version of the man show, um, I remember was when he got gangrene and I remember that in Texas. Yeah. Yeah. He almost lost his leg and uh, you know, they came back from that and everybody was hoping that he was of clean up and get his shit together, but for whatever reason, whatever, you know what? Yes, he burned brightly and he's. And he's gone. Yeah. What, what was important though about his, his artwork? What he did was he was so prolific, you know, and constantly and it is super disciplined, very disciplined in his style is like a really difficult style to be realistic with. Yeah. Because it's not like weird observations that are non sequiturs one nonsequitor after another.

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       Yeah. I know. I have this memory when it always feels like a blur, but I remember when he passed away and there was a memorial service like at carolines in New York and I was with his standing on the street with dave attell and my wife and mitchell's mother, mary, and she's passed away now. And, and, and, uh, dave and mary were smoking cigarettes and then dave goes, uh, and it was going to sound trite way. I'm repeating it, but dave has a profound nest to him that it kind of gets away with this. He was just like, we'll always have the albums, like we'll always have the albums. And it's true. There is something that, that it's like we lose a lot of people, but with mitch will, we have this really special thing. Like we have these beautiful comedy albums which are like a moment in time that are perfect jokes and like perfect wisdom. The wisdom. There's wisdom in matches comedy as far as I'm.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       Yeah, I agree. They're just, they're one of those things where he know some of his jokes are just so preposterous, but other ones, you know, you'll, you'll just, you'll just listen to it and you just go, you know, what the fuck, like, like my favorite is somebody asked me if I wanted a frozen banana. I said no, but I want a regular banana later. So yes, they're just, they're just so. There's so uniquely him, you know, and almost like, um, there's like a vein of that comedy that goes from I guess like Steven Wright know who's got that sort of absurdist, weird way of looking at things. But then mitch would take it to a totally new place. Totally personal place

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       is this joke and I'm going to kind of mess it up. But because I don't remember people's jokes that well, but like where he goes, ah, he goes, I said, I said a thing and uh, and then someone didn't hear me that well and they asked me to repeat it. And then, uh, oh, it's the steam boat operator joke and I'm forgetting the how it gets to it. But, but uh, but it's about being, it's all, it's ultimately about being misunderstood. I feel bad. I feel bad. I went down that road thinking that my brain, maybe I need some more of these chemicals, you dah, dah, dah, dah. What? All of these things. I have a fancy coffee that is super good that you with the butter in it. Yeah. Bulletproof coffee. It'S not working for me yet, but it's early man for a comedian here is, there's a, there's a, there's a joke.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       I'm trying to find them. If you do, if you youtube steve mode operator, you'll find that joke. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to find. I got to say like, of the things I even, even like hearing you talk before we started talking, the thing that I admire about your comedy and niches and like stan hope, stan homes by favorite comeback by far. And the reason why it's the same thing that you have and all the comics are maria bamford. No one could steal their jokes. Oh they do. But you, but you can't. You can't steal them and have the other person wouldn't. Uh, it wouldn't go so well as well as it will for, you know. Well, yeah, if that's. Isn't that the beautiful thing about comedy when it comes from your personality, you know, when like you listened to a mitch hedberg Joke, you know, like the double tree hotel job, you know, like there's he minds in a way that I, I would never mind, you know, like he minds from material in a way, like another good example that is patent patent oswald get to like, I look at it like I've listened to some of his cds and I go, that's a bit that I probably would have abandoned.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       I would have started maybe working on, tried it on stage a few times and just moved on to something with more meat to it. But he'll take an idea that's like an odd idea that maybe I would have abandoned and turn it into an amazing 10 minute Chunk, you know? Yeah. Patents totally like that. It'll also, one of the things I love about patents, he's just genuinely passionate about what he's talking about. Here it is a, I wrote a letter to my dad. I wrote, I really enjoy being here, but I accidentally wrote rarely instead of really, but I still wanted to use it, so I crossed it out and wrote, I rarely drive steam boats dead. You don't know about me. Kind of act like I'm a steam boat operator. Took a harsh turn right away, like one of my favorite jokes of all time.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       It's a perfect joke. that was a great impression. By the way, this not exactly like that's like a piece of philosophy I think. Yeah, just a joke. I really do think that. Well it's a piece of mitch didn't know that, that in and tells a way of saying it. You know, we, we still have the albums we do. We have that. Yeah, we do have that. It was one of the coolest things about the art form, you know, the, the insight into how a person's mind functions and how they put together material that you know, like gaffigan, like I don't think like the african. Is that his writing up there? Yeah. Isn't that great? Don't believe people believe. Is that the documentary? Or even themselves believe in ghosts, but they don't believe in themselves. That's a great. We should tell people what the url is of that site because it's a.

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       It's a you. It's on youtube. This documentary. We're lynn his widow in shock her off. there's a very funny comic as well. It's in the cabin that they shared and she takes out his notebook and she's showing what it was in his notebook. Yeah. And they're there. Cabin was up in big bear, right? Like when he got a development deal, you know, some people go out and they buy a mercedes. He boughT a cabin in big bear. Yeah, exactly. Nobody's said to me, what's it's funny looking at this notebook. Mitch goes, today, I opened for him and the first time I ever featured jokers comedy club in dayton, Ohio, I know, play and goes, ah. He goes, uh, don't ever show a girl your notebook because she's not supposed to know about it. you're just supposed to see the final jokes onstage. That's so true. Isn't that true? When you date girls and they see your act over and over and over again and they lose all the magic you have to meet and marry them or break up with it. You got to do one or the other because otherwise they're going to tell their friends.

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       He just repeats the same shit every night and then he gets it right. It's not that big a deal. I can do it. The mystique goes away. The mystique, that mystique of writing, but he was a. He was such a unique guy in that he did obviously have issues with drugs, but he also obviously it was really fucking prolific and really wrote a lot and was really disciplined. Yeah, no, in that sense it was just an odd combination of things. Yeah. No. Yeah, absolutely. Was. He's a. He was a phenomenon. Yeah. People should live. If I. I feel like I should almost plug this. I was talking to mitch altogether. Great album. You can get an itunes or spotify or whatever and a and strategic grill locations was his first album. I love that. Perfect. Strategic grill locations is an awesome, awesome classic. Now you've got a new album out coming out is.

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       No, it Just came out. It's, um, yeah, it's called my girlfriend's boyfriend. It's about a, it's about a lot of like heartbreak and love and, and how I decided to get married despite the fact that I don't reallY believe in the idea of marriage. Yeah, it's a stupid idea, but it works for them. It works for women. Women love it. They love it. They love being able to tell their friends are married getting. That's what it is. Oh yeah, definitely. They like winning. They win and then you might get married when they enjoyed that. Yeah. My wife, totally one. That's an interesting perspective. I've never thought about it like that. But uh, yeah, I'm happier though. Are you? Are you happy? Oh yeah. Yeah. But it's just because I'm in a great relationship. I would have been just as happy if I didn't have some shit written down on paper or wearing a little monkey ring.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       It's all that stuff is. It seems secondary, but for women it means a lot that you go through that nonsense. Or for some women I should say, I shouldn't never generalize like that. Some of them they want that. They want that nonsense. They want that cultural nonsense. They want to be able to tell their friends are married. Yeah. I think. Well I think part of it's the family too. Yes. The families are like, what's going on? Oh yeah. Real people start to go. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. There's certain things that people just don't like it. They don't believe unless it has a formal cultural understanding. LIke this is maybe a tangential example, but like my cat passed away this summer and for your cap, trying to figure out how you're going to come back. so like, uh, I don't know either yet, but uh, my cat I haven't passed away.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       My wife and I were so upset like, so like it, like the whole summer was like our cat passed away. That's people will be like, what's up? We'd be like, our cap. I haven't passed away the whole summer. Yeah, we were really upset by it. He was 17 years old. I have a 17 year old category now. Yeah. So like we were so, so close to ivan and explaining that your cat died is a little bit like explaining that your imaginary friend died where you're like, he ivan's dead and they're like, write a event and you're like, no, no, really, our cad ivan, they're like your cat. And I feel like marriage is a little bit like that too. You're like, if you're not married you can be like, it's my boyfriend and I love him and he loves me. And they were like, right your boyfriend? And he loves you. Yeah, exactly. If yOu're married and it's like, oh, you got the document, you've got the legal well okay, I buy it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Yeah. And then there's some people that they look at that as like there's like goals that they have to achieve, get in a relationship. Okay, check now next move. You got to get this guy to sign this paper. And I hate that. Yeah, that's the part of it. I have a friend who went through a fucking absolutely brutal divorce. I mean a really, really bad one. And then his new wife, he, you know, he started dating this woman immediately afterwards of course, and she didn't want to sign a prenup. Yeah. And he lost everything and you know, and it's like I don't know what to do. And you don't know what to do. You don't know what to do. Do you, do you hate yourself? Like, are you fucking crazy? Like match doesn't always work out, buddy. It doesn't always work out the prenup on the second marriage.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Oh, interesting. When he lost everything on the first man. Yes, he lost everything on the first marriage and I'm pretty sure they overlapped. Like his first marriage was fine. I'd have to ask him about this. His first marriage was falling apart and then he met her and there was like, you know, he knew her while he was still with his wife and then he got divorced like he had like, you know, the old expression about like swinging from branch to branch that uh, you know, most women especially, they don't like to let go of a branch. They like to swing and then know that there's another branch there when they let go theIr first branch.

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       You don't have to say women. You just said people. Yes. Humans. Humans. Yeah. But, but like, uh, yeah. The, the, the, the marriage thing is weird now particularly to be in light of all of these supplements and things that you talk about because people are just going to live longer. Well, not with this stuff. I mean really, I mean if you're lucky you get another five years or 10 years. Alpha and proteIn vitamins. I'm like, oh man. What studies have been done on life extension as far as like vitamins? Well, a little bit. I mean I guess all that combined with like hip replacements and heart transplants and all is well, there's so much futuristic stuff right now that's gonna make people live longer and then it's going to be like, it already was weird that we were married 30 years and what if I were married 70 years?

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       Well, in that sense, I think that if it works, it works and if you're married for 30 years and you really happy and then you get to live for another hundred, would you want to break up and start fresh with a new person and try to put it together? Like part of what makes a marriage work or friendship work or anything is you kind of understand how each other works. Kind of understand what the ins and the. Absolutely. Yeah. That when that happens so much theoretically in practice when it's done perfectly, which it never is, but when it is done perfectly, that's what makes it so cool is that you know each other, you know, like you'd go to the store and like, oh, I know she loves this kind of shit. I'll go to go get her this or you know, you're going to go on a vacation.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       She's never going to want to do this or she loves doing this. Yeah. You know each other. So in that sense, would it really matter if you live to be an extra hundred years? Probably not, except you'd start thinking about all that extra pussy. Yeah. That age 100 pussies crazy I've heard. Just gets different. Just different. It's like wine in a barrel or old scotch. I'm going to just read. I just want to take that back from the record. I know this is live, but I just want to take back that age 100 line. These are just jokes folks. You looked at this stuff written down on paper. You go, these guys are assholes. Statements are these, but in the moment this is great. Yeah. Seeing the moment. It's exciting. I love that you have this. Oh, the studio. The studio and you have your people who listen and like you don't even have to go.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       I'm going on conan tonight. You don't have to go on conan. You don't have to go and talk just because you have like your. I looked on your website. You're playing like goddamn chicago theater, chicago theater or what? That is so huge. You can't get bigger than that and you're just here in your studio being like, hey guys, I'm coming to chicago theater. Yeah. Yeah. I'm coming soon. When is that? January 24th chicago theater. Me and uh, the great ari shaffir should. She'll be good times. Yeah. That place is awesome res. But he could close. Ari shapiro is legit. Headliner now. Oh no, I'm sure. Do you know ari? I think I'd do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This thing is, um, I remember seeing him in that video though. Carlos see a video? Yes. Yeah. He was one of the first cars that carlos ripped off back in the day when not.

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       I shouldn't say that. I'm sure carl started ripping guys off way before already, but one of the first guys that I knew that like suffered from it. Yeah. But yeah, this place sort of as come together slowly but surely. It's pretty humble becoming more and more child. Like as I add special effects pieces. When I look around here, I'm like, I feel like you could be. I think you might be like a politician in the future. Do you ever get that feeling? No. Now how the fuck do you get that? You look around, you see a predator mask, you see an alien had a zombie, a lava lamp, deer skull, and you like, you know what, you should be running. Shit, here's what I, here's what I get, here's how I hire arrived there. So, so with jay, with jfk, you had the first president who was on camera, he was good looking and, and before that you didn't have to be good looking as a president. That's interesting that, that was like a big shift in culture and they say that barack obama is the first president at where it's like, he's like a rockstar precedent. Like people are like, he's fucking cool. Like I've, you know, like a lot of people say like, people voted for him because they're just excited. It's so exciting. I'm going to take it a step further, like 20 years from now, the president. And it's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       Hilarious about wanting the military industrial complex. Unless some massive paradigm shift takes place where we no longer have wore a. I don't see anybody running any country. Being hilarious. President is hilarious and he's in a great shape. And uh, yeah, that's all I got. That's why I think you could be a politician in the future. Right. That's it. Maybe the time has come because I feel like if you were in charge, I would vote for you because I would feel confident. I'd be like, okay, sure. He smoked some pot jury posts, most smoked some pot on that. But he's really strong, physically strong, smart, funny. I'm, that's enough for me. Reasonable, reasonable, reasonable. Is I probably the most important thing. Anybody. What do you think the most important quality you need to govern? I think it's probably not wanting to govern. Not wanting to be the guy that's in charge.

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       I think that might be one of the best qualities than anybody could ever have. if you want to run things, he should not want to be the guy who runs things. Yeah, I think so. I think low level headed I think is a huge quality. I mean I feel like the reason I voted for barack obama is like, I just felt like, okay, he seems smart, but what was the alternative? It seems levelheaded, dead man in a dump. That was the alternative. And so what was the alternative? The next. It was a fucking mormon. A guy who's literally believes in one of the most preposterous religious stories in the history of humanity. And he, his family was a part of a cult that moved to Mexico so they can have more wives. Yeah. You knoW that story about it? Fuck his. His, uh, mitt romney, mitt romney's parents.

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       They lived in Mexico. Oh yeah. I didn't even know. He didn't know that. I think I had heard about it, but I, I don't know the full story. His dad could never be president because his dad was born in Mexico. Oh, his dad wasn't an american citizen that way. It wasn't born with a natural born citizen where, you know, mit is. He was born in America, but his family comes from this sect of mormonism that broke off from the United States back in the 18 hundreds when it really didn't matter if he lived in. He can live in Mexico. you live in America. It doesn't matter. There's no cars. So that's what they did. They moved to Mexico. Shit didn't turn out so good for that bet. That bet suck. Like the bet that. Well, it's nice down here. It's pretty much the same as it is in America. We're just going to go over here and have 10 wives. Well obviously when the invention of cars came along and the whole

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       age of machines in the industrial era machines and you know, the United States became this superpower and Mexico became what it is today and now they're involved in these, these armed standoffs with the mexican drug cartels. They get kidnapped, they have a fortified compounds and they have centuries and snipers and rifles and everything. I mean, it's really crazy. Crazy shit. Vice did a piece on that on the, uh, the varIous mormon families that are living in. But that was our other option or other option was one of those guys, a guy who believes in magic underwear and a fucking con artist of who was 14 years old who Claimed the found golden tablets that contained the last work of jesus and that the american indians were a tribe of Israel lights that came over. I mean, it's just, that's a great book if people want to know about mormonism at all, is under the banner of heaven.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       No good scrapbook. yeah. Did you see the book of mormon krakauer wrote it? Yeah. Um, the uh, book of mormon is great. I twice. It's fucking amazing. So good. You know, the crazy thing is mormons. Mormons, like when you get the playbill advertising advertisement. Yes. Yeah. For the. That is so great. Yeah. Yeah. Now you've seen the play could come find out, would be in a mormon is really all about like they think they're going to like, like people go to like go watch that hilarious parody of what their religion is all about. I think that maybe I'm taking it too far, but I feel like matt and trey are the closest to twain that we have where it's like what they're doing is brilliant satire. It's completely over the top and insane and perfectly written and they're fucking gangsters. They get away with the craziest shit on tv.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       it's not. Did you ever see the sloughed off with paris hilton, paris hilton and the gay guy who was the teacher? And the gay guy wins because he stuffs paris hilton up his ass. man, he's stuffed her up. They can get away with so much because they're cartoons I know. And they take on like, like the idea of drawing. Muhammad muhammad was teddy bear. I saw that episode. they take on things. Where is this? The sloughed off. Watch this. He shoves it up his ass. He jumped on her in a gay cowboy outfit all with the big mustache and shoved her up his ass. I mean. And then they cheer the kanye west gay fish one with the kanye west and carlos mencia episodes. It's one of the greatest take downs and like a history of kind of stuff is too good of, of, of a pop culture. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. that's what it honestly intimidates me about los angeles is like matt and trey are here, you know, like these people who I admire so much. They just all live here in this area and

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       I. It's too much for me. I live in New York. I just, I like being away from it, like intimidates you. I feel like like I don't want to, it's almost like I don't want to see baton. Trey lIke eating at a restaurant or something. Like I don't why? I don't want to think the real. I don't want to think that they're mortal or something like it's too. It's I like, I love the mystique of show business. So you like being in New York because you're outside of it. I live in brooklyn. I don't. I'm not part of the show business really. That's interesting. You're here on the joe rogan experience podcast to promote your new comedy cd. Right. Yet you claim to not be in show business. What do you do? Mr bib?

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       I travel around the country. I've gone to other cities. Is here. Oh, you just traveL. Professional. Travel. Traveler. Professional traveler. I always say that. I always say to them that traveling salesman, I sell comedy. I get paid to fly and performed for prey. That's funny. It's true. I'm going to fucking 100 cities next year. Wow. Thank god for jokester. 100. I'm Going to. I'm going to forester, which though it's called thank god for jokes isn't the name of the tour. Oh, uh oh. Thank god for jokes tour. Yeah. I thought you were saying thank god for jokester, like joke. Show that thing that sends you out to these places like friendster or you remember that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like it's a, some kind of book. You're shit way in advance. You can see the photo. Maybe if we can bring it up. Thank god for. Or just exec comm.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       I don't know. You, you, um, you play In your shit out way in advance. Then if you're doing 100. Yeah. I've announced 30. What are the obscure places? Because they go to fargo. Oh yeah. Here you go. Go to fargo or minneapolis. I'm going to traverse city, Michigan, east, lansing fargo, minneapolis, minneapolis, minneapolis is not obscure now. Now I guess you know, but like eugene, Oregon, that's obscure ones. Pretty obscure hippy place. Lotta, lotta like petrouli people in that audience. I was in New York. That's kind of obscure, obscure as fuck. Where do you play there? Uh, there's no place to play. Go to some dude's house. I mean, I'm going to charleston charleston's kinda. Well that's kind of a name though. I think I could name 100 different cities. I mean I probably could if you sat me down. Yeah. Someone put a blank map in front of you.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       You get it. Kentucky. Huh? Doing a little Kentucky. Kentucky. Louisville is fun and then it was a great town. It's a great town. Here's the thing I've found about traveling around America. I'm sure you've probably found this. A lot of great little towns will also mike birbiglia fans. they know who you are that I'm going to show up. They're in a good mood. Yeah. they're already. They're already familiar with you. You know, like you go to like boise, Idaho. It's like, oh, this is a nice town. Boise's great people make fun of these towns. And then you go there. You're like, oh no, there's like five grade breakfast spots. You know what I mean? By the way, might be a better place to live and it might be a bad place to live. Yeah. That's tension. Less stress. Less traffic. That's the one thing that stupid About la is the massive humans all gathered into one place.

Speaker 2:          00:32:46       It's insane. It's a great place to have a podcast because you could always get guests, you know, there's always people here, but as far as like having sanity and having peace and clarity, this is not the best bot. What's in santa barbara? Coffee. Try this nurse. Do you like anything sweet? I'll try that. It's just stevia. It's super strong. It's a natural sweetener. Only put a little bit in. Okay. So it's very powerful. I already had butter in the coffee so I feel like it's covered dishes, but like los angeles is crazy because like coming here for example, I just google map everything on the way and then it's like it'll be like A, it's 26 miles and then for time it'll be like, it might take days.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       That's no joke either. You can get stuck in bumper to bumper traffic, a tukul just a little dash of that stuff. Don't fuck around. Don't get crazy crazy. My grandma trying not to just throw in a little stevia in there. Just that little bit more of that get a little crazy. They go, stop right there. It's amazing. It's really strong stuff. But this, this sounds crazy. It's uh, it just, it feels dangerous. It feels like I'm in at risk of being in a car accident at any moment. well, you're at west wintertime. You're in a car, you know the, the. It's an amazing really. When you stop thinking about it really good by the great, right? Yeah. It's amazing when you to think about how few car accidents there actually are the ones in my special, which I hope you'll watch, but I watch it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       I'm very proud of. I say I hope. Well, there's no need for hope's. Okay. So I get. I talk about how I was hit by a car in los angeles and then that was made to pay for the drunk driver's car. Really drunk driver. I was made to pay for his cars. His written maddening. How you made to pay for his car. He technically had the right away. I was turning right. He was speeding around a blind corner. He technically had the right away. And then by the time he got to the hospital, he blew under the legal limit once in a while. So I wanted to take before you get paid $12,000 for his car, like a couple hours later. Wow. That's hilarious. Now I don't test them right away. Nope. In this instance, no. And then. And so the thematic really what it's about is about how like I couldn't let go of it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Like it sounds like you have this from, you know, when I listened to you on the podcast, like certain times you're obsessed with being right about something. And I couldn't let this go. I like, it was kinda like this with the papers, it's like I have charts and graphs and I was like, I was like, and this is and this is the accident report and this is the map is the google map of the scene of the accident. And it was, it was 60 feet from here to the stop sign and the speed limit was 35 and it was in his matt onstage with like lenny bruce at the end of his career when he would go on with legal document. You'll, you'll see in this special I project to the accident report. The actual report. Yeah. It's bonkers. Yeah. I project the extra part in the show.

Speaker 2:          00:35:41       It's great. It's so the guy was drunk. He, but he technically had the right away. I'm trying to figure it out in my mind. You were going around a blind corner and coming around blind corners. he was coming around, we're speeding around a blind corner on venice beach. And you pulled into the trap. I pulled into a, into a road and then he t boned me driver's side. Wow. and then. And then I spun around and then he, um, drove away, took a right turn at the intersection, tried to speed away, but he was so drunk he drove into a tree. So it was like a hit and run and hit and still didn't get in trouble for that. Yeah. That's saying, I talked to lawyers, I talked to private investigators. They were just like, dude, it's going to cost you more in legal fees to fight this.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       You know? I was like, I'm going to sue this guy and I'm going to sue the los angeles police department. Like I was like, chinatown, chinatown. It was maddening. Well, in the effort to protect people's rights, things get kind of squirrely. Yeah, I'm all for protecting people's rights, but I think that once you start driving intoxicated and slamming into people like they need to figure out who's drunk right away after an accident, you can't let people go all the way to the hospital again. Fine. You need that. That's something that needs to be dealt with on the spot, but the question is, who's going to be the guy who deals with it? It's going to be some knucklehead police officer that's we're going to hold you down, tase you, and then take your blood. I mean, how do they, how do they get it? They got to have blood, right?

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       Don't they have to take. They can test your blood alcohol content. They do the breathalyzer thing, right. But yeah, the most accurate ways his blood and that's way you could. We could be on pills too. Yeah, that's true. That's true. He could be on drugs. Yeah, it, when I went, I went to the hospital just to make sure I was okay. I went to the emergency room and they saw him first because he was a more urgent case. I don't know what had happened to him, but I fucking tree. That's. Yeah, exactly. And I said to the doctor, I was like, was the other guy drunk? and the doctor says, well, you know, I can't answer that. This is the same doctor. So both of us. And I was like, well, was he, you know, and uh, and he goes, well, he's heading the jail now.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       And uh, and at the time I was like, case closed, you know, like I thought like I was like, I was like, oh, this isn't going to be an issue. And then a couple of months later I get the bill for his car. It was maddening. That's so crazy. Who's this asshole? What's his name? I can't say, fuck this guy, I am. I considered, I don't saY this in the show, but if there were certain points I considered, I had his phone number, it was on the accident report. I consider just calling him and being like, you should know that you are ruining my life. Hmm. Well, I think that's been a little bit dramatic for isn't really ruining your life. It was just making you crazy, but the fact that you have to pay for them or let's be honest, I'm just saying that's how I felt.

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       A couple of a couple of jokes and that taken care of. you're in a very fortunate position in life. Maybe you should cut your losses. Thanks joe. But you got comedy acts, this 2020 insight hindsight. Yeah. It's really easy reflection. I would have went to his house and kicked his ass. Locked up in jail. You the least. She got comedy out of it though, right? I mean, I feel great. I mean honestly the comedy is everything to me. I. That's why. Thank you. But thank god for jokes. Tore my new show that I'm developing is actually all about how to like jokes are in a certain way. My religion, like they're there. They're the philosophy that I believe in. I believe life iS hard and then we make jokes about it because it's all we can do and it makes it more fun. Yeah. Still to this day, stand up comedy is one of my favorite things to watch.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       I still enjoy it very much as an audience member and if someone told me that I could never perform comedy for the rest of my life for some strange reason, but I could still watch it. I was still love watching it. Yeah, it's great man. I thought stan hope specialists year. The beer hall push I think is how you pronounce it. Yeah. That was like one of the best comedy specials I've ever seen. It was a really good one. That was my wife and I were just like, it was like a euphoric experience that you have is watching it. Yeah. He's uh, he's working hard man. And one of the things that stand helps doing is he's like, really? He is that guy. He lives in the desert. He lives in this weird fucking town, Arizona. That's base bisbee, Arizona. Seven miles from the mexican border.

Speaker 2:          00:40:06       He invites people over to his house for a, for superbowl parties. I know he's a nut. I mean, he's a legit nut. He's a great guy too. He's really. He's really like, come into his own as an artist, as a standup comedian. That special is if there are any aspiring comedians listening or watching. See that special before turning the gun on himself as a great one too. He's got a bunch of great ones. He's got lots of good stuff. This is the one where he talks about letting his mother go. Yeah. Yeah. That's an incredible story. Yeah. Yeah. It's good stuff, man. I couldn't live in bisbee, Arizona. I don't know what the fuck is thinking. He's just very strange. I don't know how to describe what that man. He's got a great joke about lIving there too though. The idea of it being an artist community and the difference between how his art and there are.

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       It doesn't really go together. They make turquoise belt buckles and he's making a joke about tsunami victims, about how the the drowned japanese, they start to swell and they take on this korean look and I'm really butchering the pit, but it's fucking hilarious. It's comparison between his art, what he considers art and what they consider art artists community. You know, one of the things I love about him is hilt keeps twisting the knife and different directions. Yeah. Like he'll take you one way and you'll be like, ooh, I don't know if I could go there and then he'll take you back farther in the other direction farther, right. Than you could think you get go and then I'll pull you farther left than you thought. You know what I mean? Like he just always has you on your toes. He works, you know that dude.

Speaker 2:          00:41:44       You see him sitting there smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee, banging away on the keyboard, you know? And that is a, like you said, you know what you're saying, that jokes or your religion. Yeah. That the discipline of creation is really what it's all about. Whether you're writing books, whether you're writing jokes, whether you're creating music, whatever. I admire the discipline involved and creating things. Anything, podcasts, music, movies, whatever the fuck you're making. Matt and trey making south park and also having some strange amount of time to make the book of mormon as well. You see that documentary about matt and trey from south park is great nuts. People should watch this on netflix. It's called like 60, 60 seconds. The air or something like that. What is it? Sixty minutes to air. Six days to say area. Super good. Yeah. It's amazing. It's for instance, inspirational too and you realize what a bad mother fucker that.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       Well both of them but yeah, but trey bad motherfucker. Yeah. That guy's not nonstop. Yeah, he's just a nut, but I think he obviously gets off on it. I mean that's his thing. He loves creating that fucking show and that show such a perfect vehicle to. Because by doing little cartoon kids that don't look anything like reality now and then also having them be kids. So there's like a certain mount of ignorance you can get away with a child, sort of beautiful vehicle for creating comedy when you write like all this shit that you've got in front of you here. Whereby do I feel heat? Where's he coming from? Space heater. Oh, that's what it is. I was like, man, I know it heats broken. You have to get someone to climb on the roof, turn her fucking pilot light on. How retarded is up when you write, do you sit down and go, okay, today I'm going to write from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM or what?

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       I mean, how do you do it? I build it from like, like it's like I built. I brainstorm stories. So like I'll like, I'll talk to my brother joe who co writes a lot of stuff with me and we'll just talk. Like one time this happened to me, one time this happened to me. One time this happened to me and we'll talk about on the phone for like a couple hours, you know, and then we'll talk about which, which ones are good enough stories that are worth telling. And then, uh, and then I'll, and then I'll go out and try it on stage and I'll record it and I'll go back and transcribe what I said and then I'll edit from that transcription. That's interesting. So you, you cowrite with your brother. How long have you been doing that for? Ten years. Does your brother to stand up at all now?

Speaker 2:          00:44:11       He tried. He, he doesn't like it at stage, but he enjoys the creative process. Is writing super funny guy and uh, but he doesn't like being onstage. What does he do for a living? He works for me. Oh really? So he's a writer for you? Yeah, writer, producer, producer, cowrote. My movie sleepwalk with me. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah, the sleepwalk with me was really interesting for folks. Don't know mike, uh, for folks that don't know, mike is your, you're a sleepwalker. Yeah, I jumped, I dangerously, I jumped through a second story window nicely. Yeah. And uh, you talked about that on the podcast last time you were here. And that movie is sort of based on that, on how weird that thing must be to have that in you. The ability to just get up and start doing things while you're actually asleep. Yeah, it's. Yeah. It's. And it's. And I still deal with it. I sleep in a sleeping bag to this very day. I go to bed and I asleep and asleep. Give, bring a sleeping bag when you go, like camping when you go to tyler road. Yeah, exactly. They're camping when I met her. Zip yourself up so you can't get up myself up. I used to wear mittens so I couldn't open the sleeping bag.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       The doctor told me the strangest things that doctor has ever told me. He goes, I want you to go to bed at night and a sleeping bag and sleep, zip yourself up and then wear mittens so you can't open the sleeping bag, a doctor. So that to me, strange. Wow. Well this is after he jumped out the window. Yeah, he was just, he was a woman actually, that my doctor now is a male. But, uh, it was, uh, yeah, she, she was just like, I'm not sure what to tell you. In the meantime, just do this with what floor do you live on in New York? We live on my bedroom's on the second floor, but we have these really super reinforced shutters that we put in that are pretty expensive just to keep you from jumping through the window. Yeah, yeah. It was strange.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       I know. Yeah. You don't want to jump on the second floor in manhattan. Where did you jump? No, in brooklyn. Um, I jumped through the second story window of la quinta inn in walla walla, Washington. As a matter of fact, there's a plaque if you might be able to google this laquinta inn birbiglia plaque while back. There's a plaque on the door of the room, why birbiglia jumped through this window and there was a movie based on it. And it's like, because you're here and you're fine if you died then, you know. Yeah. It's um, ira glass who wrote the movie and produced the movie with me, hosted this american life on public media. He, um, he was insistent that we get the plaque put up that it was like he didn't care about like oscars or golden gloves. He was just like here, like the out the plaque and ruined january 26, 2005 comedian mike birbiglia sleep walked out the window.

Speaker 2:          00:46:59       That story became the basis for the book of the feature film. Sleepwalk with me. Seriously google it. It was not great. What a weird world we live in that. That's a plaque. Seriously. Google it is on the plaque. Yeah. Wow. Ira was really intent on getting a plaque on the room. He was like, that was everything to him. He was like, where's the plaque? Is the plaque up yet? It was like six months after I sent it to them. And so that's on the door. Just as your walking by. That's on the door. People sometimes will go to that laquinta inn. They'll take photos in front of it and then tweet it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       That's awesome. Oh, but you get a lot more now. That's hilarious. That's really fucking fun. Well, it's hilarious again, because you're okay now when you, when you jumped through the wall, like when you jumped out the window, the window through the window shattered. Oh, jump through. And I have in the movie, in the final credits, there's actual photo

Speaker 2:          00:47:50       graphs of after I jumped through the window, I photographed it like it was a crime scene because I was alone in walla walla, Washington, and I was like, nobody's going to believe me. Right, right, right. Did the hospital all this stuff. But I was like, this is too crazy of a story. I need to photograph everything. So it's all in the credits. How did you get through that without even getting really badly hurt? Be the same reason that a lot times of drunk drivers aren't hurt. They're the ones not injured. You know what I mean? When they get in car accidents because they're so relaxed, so relaxed. That's so crazy. The idea that tension is what hurts you. I dreamt. I dreamt that I was being, that there was a guided missile headed towards my hotel room. There's all this military personnel in the room with me and the missile. Could they, the, they told me that missile coordinates are set specifically on me and so I thought the only thing I could do is jump out the window so as to detonate outside the window for the sake of my platoon.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       Wow. What are you are a hero in your crazy story? I know head. Wow. That's. Fuck. Now, what was the extent of your injuries?

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       I just had, I still have scars on my legs and there was glass in my legs and they took out the glass and uh, and my arms were all cut up and I had about 30 stitches. That's nothing. It's nothing. It's nothing compared to what it could have been. Wow. And what's wild is I actually jumped through the window and landed and then got up and kept running. So you were still asleep? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Wow. As I'm running

Speaker 2:          00:49:23       running, I'm looking around and realizing like, oh, I just jumped through a window in walla walla, Washington, and I was like, oh no. And I was like, I guess I got to go to the front desk and explain what happened. Oh my god, this is a funny addendum to the story. I feel bad for my fans. Your fans. Maybe maybe you have seen the movie and maybe having my fans have heard this a zillion times. I feel bad, but I'll give you an addendum to the story which is new, which is. I always say that I walked to the front desk to explain what happened. Fortunately, the person working at the front desk was mildly retarded. And I say fortunately because he's completely unfazed. But what just happened? It's three in the morning. The phones are ringing off the hook from people staying at the hotel who just saw the guy jumped out the window screaming, I'm bleeding in my underwear and I say hello, because you have to start somewhere. I'm staying at the hotel. I had an incident where I jumped out my window. I'm bleeding and I need to see a doctor. And, and I, and I was so relieved because, uh, the guy working at the front desk goes, right? It was like completely unfazed. What had just happened, so I drove myself to the hospital. He told me where it was. The agenda is that guy who worked the front desk facebook messaged me and said, hey, I'm the guy at the front desk and I'm not mildly retarded.

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       What's great is that the, the, the, the message is so incoherent that he sent me that. It's like, well, are you sure if I forwarded this to someone? They might take my side. Oh my god. That is such a crazy fucking story. So from. Did you. Were you there for a weekend? Like did you have to do stand up there? The rest. I was performing at whitman college that night and then I was performing at university of Oregon the next day and I actually did the gig with all the brokenness and I didn't tell anybody. Wow. So you just did the gig to understand that the money you're broke and you were just mangled cut up. I wasn't, nothing messed with my face up so no one could tell I was wearing long sleeves and everything. That's so lucky. It's unbelievably fortunate. Yeah, it was just, it was, it was, honestly, it was a moment in my life where I was broke.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       I was hustling so hard. It all factored into the jump through the window. I was dealing with a lot of anxiety. So the anxiety and the stress manifests itself in the sleepwalking. Yeah. So, so I, I'm diagnosed with rem behavior disorder, which is a chemical imbalance. It means people who have a dope, some people who have a dopamine deficiency, which is the chemical that's released in your brain and your body when you fall asleep, that paralyzes your body so you don't act out your dreams. That's essentially what happens when you sleep is your body's paralyzed. You can't do it. I have a dopamine deficiency and as a result I act out my dreams. And so since then I was diagnosed, so I take, I shouldn't tell people that I take by take an antianxiety yeah. And then, uh, and it calms me down and then I don't feel like I need in my dreams to run away from things like why do you say you shouldn't tell people what you take?

Speaker 2:          00:52:28       Well, because I'm not a doctor, so I don't want to tell you, I don't want people to self diagnose and go, oh, I have that. And it's like you don't really know. I did a sleep study. I slept overnight at the hotel, at the hospital for nights. Like they really know what I have. Yeah. Well that's very responsible of you. Yeah. You know? Yeah. So when you start taking this medication, even though you're taking this medication, you still don't trust yourself. You stills up? Yeah, kinda like a condom over a birth control pill. Wow. Well, I guess once you jump out of a fucking window, got to get some reinforcement bars over your windows. Mandy worried about break ins? Nope. Breakouts, breakouts. The crazy breakouts we're trying to keep it in. Wow. Yeah. And so by taking an anti anxiety medication, has that changed you like your regular, everyday life? I'd like to think no. Uh, I fear sometimes. I mean like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       I, I, um, I feel like what I take for a while, it felt like it made me a bit fuzzy feeling when I wake up in the morning. I have to drink a lot of coffee to get to regular, which I don't love. Right. And it's all because of that. Yeah. Is there any natural cure? Is there anything that you've been going to a holistic doctor recently who's been given for as though. Oh, you don't think that's good? I don't know. I just always say that holistic doctor, all those motherfuckers, she took a, she took like a 10 vials of blood and did a whole thing on which vitamins I should take to counterbalance things. And uh, I feel like that's leveling me off a little bit. Would you watch your diet? Are you fairly healthy? Try to, yeah. Trying to have protein in the morning and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       But do you like gluten? And I'm trying to wean myself off of it. You eat gluten. I stopped about six months ago. How do you feel about it? A lot better. Well, I stopped when I was filming this show. I was having back problems from jujitsu and one of the things that this woman who's a physical therapist told me, she said real good results. People that have injuries getting off of gluten reduces inflammation and in a lot of the symptoms of the injuries subside. And I was like, wait, wait a minute, you can tell me like bread, like stopping bread makes an injury better. And she's like, you really would be amazed. And so, uh, I tried it and uh, I, my injury got better, like slowly petroleum its own through a lot of different therapies that I was doing. But what was amazing was my energy level is different.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       My energy level, especially after meals. That was the most shocking thing. Like I would, I eat so much bread and pasta and then I was realized that like after I had eaten, it was like I got hit with a tranquilizer dart. I just thought that's what it was. I thought I. And this is what happens after you eat. Eating is like sex, but no man, not now. Now I eat and after I'm done eating, I'm full but I'm not in a coma. Yeah, it's weird. It's a totally different experience for me because my basically my whole life, I mean I'm italian mostly and most of my life I grew up eating like that, eating pasta and bread with every meal and when I stopped eating it it was like, oh, oh, oh, this is what had been dealing with my whole life for no reason.

Speaker 1:          00:55:36       Like every time I eat I would eat these big giant meals. I'd be like, oh, I just kicked back and I know that feeling that don't get that anymore. Now I eat and you know, obviously my body's digesting, I feel full and I don't feel like sedated los angeles is great for that. New york is good for that, but like when you travel, do you have a hard time finding the food that you want? Steak and salad, steak salad, chicken salad. I'm not ridiculous about it because I don't have celiac's disease. It's not like a half to avoid it. So you know, if something is breaded or you know, it doesn't kill me, it just, it just. I think it sets me back a little bit. I think your body's not designed to pro. The wheat that we eat today is very different from the wheat that people had 100 years ago in the 19 fifties and sixties is when they started engineering wheat to be more hardy, so for better yields and so it could survive pesticides and whatnot and that we is much more difficult for people to process just is.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       It's a fact that's a science. Yeah, I mean there, there is science behind that. So when people talk about, oh, it's just another fad, it's just another fad. It's actually not, you know, there, there were most certainly fads, you know, as far as, you know, like the atkins diet and all these various diets that can work, you know, they, they can have an effect, you know, you go into ketosis, I guess it's called and you know, your body starts burning fat instead of carbohydrates and I tried that. I didn't like it at all. This is very different. This to me seems like cutting out something that my body really just doesn't enjoy process. Yeah, that makes sense. No, I mean I still look, I'm not a. I'm not a perfect eater. I still eat ice cream and I still drink milk. And what do you do about pizza?

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       Gluten free pizza. I don't. I try it. It's dark shit. It's dog shit. I haven't had pizza in alongside format to have pizza. Yeah, I haven't had pizza and like it's been at least six or seven months since I've had except some gluten free pizza, which was uh, I just, uh, I made a tweet about it. I said I'm having gluten free pizza and to let you know, you don't have to, don't ever just don't. It's not pizza, it's nonsense. Someone said there's a good kind out there, but I think that just builds fucking people that don't want to believe. Yeah. I don't know. But uh, as far as like health, I think the majority of people don't get enough. The big issue I think as far as nutrition is, is green leafy vegetables and uh, and, and, and lots of vegetables. People just don't eat enough vegetables.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       And if you don't eat enough vegetables and you also don't take vitamins. Yeah, good luck. You know, your body's just basically operating on proteins and carbohydrates and whatever the fuck it can find, but you're not getting enough vitamins. You're just not like the idea of a balanced diet. Most people's diet or they're not even close to balanced. It's like I've watched friends like, been like on, on the road, like comics. I've been with them for every meal, you know, and I've watched what they eat and like you, you're not getting anywhere like you got. You got an egg in there. Yeah. There's some bread in that. I think there's a piece of lettuce. They're like, where the fuck you getting your vitamins from, man? Yeah, I think I'm in that boat. Do you take supplements? You take vitamins. I just started to like two months ago. Just started. Really? Wow. You're so disappointed. No, sorry. It's interesting. Did you notice a difference once you started taking vitamins? Yeah. I feel better. I feel better. I have. Everybody's on starving. Yeah, your vitamin starved. I invited him and starved. Yeah, but most of us are. If you eat the average quote unquote average american diet, your vitamin starved. Yeah. It's, it's hard to travel and be healthy. It is what I started doing nights or doing yoga and I travel. I feel better. I feel a lot better than that. That's because of all the girls

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       that yoga pants in the class. It makes you feel better too. Is that what it is? Excited. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing. No yoga. I could just go to the yoga pants or. Yeah, you can just go to a strip club and you feel great. Well, I started going to strip clubs in the road and I just, uh, I really, it really picked me be I wrote down a strip club name. I played largo the other night and there's a place across from it that, I don't know what it's called in the phone book, but the name on the outside of the door is star strip is all the same font and font size. Star strip. Totally nude live nude girls, girls, girls. The star strip on la cienega. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I had a bit about that it true story, um, where the girl was dancing and I said, hey, do you, do you like doing this? She goes, I don't talk to guys who come here. And I said, well, why? I mean it's an open door. I mean, like, nice people can come through too. And she goes, well, most guys who come here, the only come here for one reason. I mean, why did you come here? Like she was shutting me down and I said, because someone told me there was a place that I could do go where I could see a strange girl's pussy for a dollar.

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       And that was the joke. Like, I'm the asshole. I only did it show up where you work, right? I'm not a bad person because you work here, you know, different people go to different places, different reasons to go to strip clubs a lot. And you know, it turned me off. I was in nashville once, I saw a commercial on tv for a strip club and I was like, I would like, that seems fun. I'll go there. And uh, and they went and then I gave the guy my id when I walked in and he goes, hey mike birbiglia, I like your comedy. And I was just like, I'm never going to a strip club again. I've never gone back. Why? Because I liked the anonymity of it. I don't want to be, I don't want anyone to watch me watch someone beating it. I just, I'm not, I can't handle that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       You need a wig and a fake mustache and if you have a wig or a fake mustache one, we're in hollywood. There's plenty of stores. Yeah, I, that's why I'm here. Sorry. It took so long for me to get to the point. But uh, yeah. Do you have like a costume I can wear because I'm really want to go guy. And he goes, no, no, no. It's funny you should say that about you're asking like why, why, why the woman was there and everything. Because that's when I used to go to strip clubs. That was what I was most interested in the story. I want to know the story. How did you get here? And maybe, maybe it's kind of mean spirited and suddenly, but I actually, it is interesting to me. I don't think it's mean spirited. No, I mean you can have a look. I have been to many a strip club with my dad and I've had some fun conversations with girls who are dancers. It wasn't

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       demeaning, it wasn't meant it respectfully. When I would do it. Very nice people, they just happen to be dancers. There's nothing wrong with it, man. I think there's a weird sort of a connection between standup comics and strippers anyway because they were. Our worlds are so odd in comparison to the average person, oddly similar, I think in a lot of ways. Well, because standup comedy, you're as naked as you can be. Yes. Verbally and you're talking about, you're talking about your life, the best comedians essentially as you're watching them make it a certain way. Absolutely. And you know, and that's obviously the strippers who literally. Yeah. And you're also living this weird alternative life that most people can't relate to it. Most people with nine to five jobs can't relate to. Very strange. Yeah. Like if you did a stripper and she comes over your house at 3:00 in the morning after she gets off work and she's got a little glitter bag full of money and it's like we're both weird, you know, I just got done telling jokes and drinking on stage and here you got off stage.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       That's what they're weird lives. Being an actor is a weird life if you didn't act or strange. Yes, but in a more, a less naked way. And your wife, girlfriends, like making out with some guy in the day. True work over and over again. That's ridiculous. After take. Fuck that. Yeah, I've seen that before. I've seen people like watch their wives or girlfriends a make out with other guys like tongue and everything and watch him and watch her and watch him and watch her and go, I don't want to do that. Yeah, but the acting thing is like the opposite of being naked. It's like putting on a fucking outfit or. You think so? Yeah. I don't think it's naked at all. I think the acting is, is putting on armor that's putting on this armor of this bullshit character that some writer created and you're pretending to be this person, whereas.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       No, but I think the best ones are opening up, opening up. They're opening up their souls. I think the best ones, the best actors. I mean they become that guy, but I mean like, okay, here's a perfect example. A christian bale in the machinist. He wasn't really an anorexic, that was the. Couldn't sleep and he forced himself to do that. He just became that guy for that role. It was a, it was, uh, it was an affectation. He put it on. It was a costume. It was a, you know, a role he played. It wasn't him who. He decided to be me. We can find areas in ourselves. That's one of the weirdest fucking that is so weird that he was bullying. It's him next to batman when he was fucking swole, which is only like six months later. I think the one, the photo on the left is real.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He starved himself. He ate like a can of tuna and an apple like every day. That's all he ate and he got down to an insanely small size. I think he was to like 130 pounds or something ridiculous like that. He's a big guy and then he went up to 200 plus when he played batman. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty nuts, man. That guy's nuts that, that, that thing that they do. Like I just got back from last week and I saw dallas buyers club here. Matthew mcconaughey. Fucking fantastic. Heard. It's great. I have a friend who always shits on matthew mcconaughey and thinks that matthew mcconaughey's correcting is terrible. Matthew mcconaughey is like, his ego is transparent and is acting. It's mostly because my friends in actor, but uh, I said, dude, you got to watch dallas buyers club and then shut the fuck up because the guy knocks it out of the park is fantastic in it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:00       I saw two movies this weekend. I saw, I saw the catching fire. I liked it with catching fire. The hunger games movie. How dare you say that? Why nothing. I know. Everybody makes fun of me. I like gravity. I don't know. It was good. I enjoyed it. I, you know what I thought was fascinating about gravity, which watching neil degrasse tyson a tweet about everything that's wrong, the movie and then watching people attack him because I saw a lot of that because neil degrasse tyson is like, he's one of those guys that I don't think ever takes heat, you know, because he's such a nice guy. He's so brilliant. He's so well informed about the ways of the universe and so excellent at expressing himself. He's one of the best representatives of science I think we have today, and he always gets love everywhere. He goes like everybody's all these internet memes of pictures of him.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       Then this came out and he starts correcting the movie and the fucking hate. You can't correct a Sandra Bullock movie. He just can't. Yeah, you can't hate on Sandra Bullock. They fucking went after him. Well, neil degrasse tyson says his criticisms of gravity or a compliment to its quality. Huh? That's, that's because he took. I took the hit the right to. To earn the right to be criticized as a high compliment indeed. What? Hmm. That sounds like a guy fucking feeling the heat talking nonsense, feeling the heat. Some people criticize the story of the movie and I was like, you know, I felt like 10 minutes in I was like, I got my $15 worth. I never thought that I'd know what it felt like to go to space. Yeah. I love the fact that everything was silent. Me too. He's like in the middle of the explosions and all this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       It's silent and yet you're still freaking the fuck out is actually more effective. I thought. Did you see the director's movie? Children of men. Children of men? Yes. I saw. Yeah. That was the one where people are like, the males are like, the people can't breed or something. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The, um, the thing that I found was most fascinating about gravity, um, was the, just the idea that people do really go up there and really do stay up there for long periods of time and space and they really are in grave danger and they this, this possibility of things colliding and space junk to very real, real problem. Yeah. This fucking thousands of things floating around above the earth. Thousands. It's so insane. I'd love, I'd love john august, the screenwriter made this point that I think is of brilliant about it, which is what's exciting about the movies.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       It's $100 million dollar movie major budget movie where the lead character doesn't save the world. She just saves herself. And that's powerful. Yeah. What people didn't like to. A lot of people didn't like the george clooney guy because it was just so. And the other thing was when he lets go when he has to let go because it's pulling him away. There's no momentum in space. People said the science if it's wrong. Yeah, science is so wrong. I was fine with that though because I don't know much about science. The science is not just wrong about that, it's also wrong about the positions of the various space stations, like they're not anywhere near each other. Like what she did by skipping from one to the next would be absolutely completely impossible there. They're not in the same hemisphere that nowhere near to each other. I just gave it the benefit, the benefit of the doubt because she had that weird divorce because of Jesse James.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       He gave this movie the benefit of the doubt. That's how it works. We'll let it go with the science stuff just because she's had a hard time last couple of years. Yeah, that's sweet of you. Yeah. Well I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a big fan of anything space. I think space is probably the most overlooked thing. Fascinating. The history of humanity. It's incredible. Which still have enough light. I feel that way about the see the season. Other one. Yeah. The sea and space are the two most interesting places I think. Yeah, the sea less so for me, but still pretty fucking fascinating. You know, it's basically like a jungle or underwater. I loved what you were tweeting the other day about black fish because I think that that's a great cause. Oh yeah. We had the filled dimmers who was a trainer over at seaworld or whatever the heck it was, marine land in Canada.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       That was depressing. I know it's miserable, but it's good that you're tweeting about it because it's a good cause. Yeah, I agree. It is. Um, I see life very fascinating to me. Intelligency life even more so. I just think people are very. This is not funny or an item here or there, but I just think people are generally unwilling to accept sea life and animals as having an intelligence that we just don't understand. Well, they certainly to mean there, there's no doubt about it. When, when you talk to people who understand orcas are or dolphins, they're very intelligent. Yeah. Just intelligent in a different way because they don't alter their environment. And as we were talking about space, about how fascinating spaces that the real issue is, if we treat intelligent lifeforms on this planet that we can understand the way that we do, especially helpless ones essentially help us once, like orcas and dolphins, they really can't do anything to prevent us from doing what we want them to do.

Speaker 1:          01:11:28       It really can't prevent us from kidnapping them. They can just try to run away, but they can't fight back. They really can't do anything. What w what? What are. What is an alien race going to do to us? If they ever get ahold of us, oh, I'm so worried. And they see how we treat intelligent life forms. Why would they respect us? Why would they want to do anything? Why would they? Why would they be kind? Why would they give us information? Why would they try to help us evolve? They'd go, well, it's going to go. Aliens is going to go. And it's not an if it's a. When when the aliens come or we arrive at the aliens, it's going to go one of two ways. We enslave them, they enslave us. That's it, that's the only version of what can happen or we eat them or they know.

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       Oh, we fucked up. Right. Yeah. Do you, do you, um, ever get a chance when you do an all your travel? Do you ever get a chance to go to any observatories? The cat in Hawaii or you know, any of the telescopes I tried to, yeah, I haven't done it recently, but yeah, I tried to, one of the most life changing things I've ever done besides psychedelic drugs and having kids is a, going to the keck observatory. Where is that? It's on the big island of Hawaii. Oh, the fucking view of the stars is so mind blowing. You can't believe it's real because you're, you're on the island. It's 9,000 feet above sea level as the visitors place. And then there's the main observatory, which is higher than that. You're literally, I'm looking at the picture. It's not evil. You're above the clouds. That's literally above the clouds as we were driving, you know, um, I was with my family and we were like, oh, this sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:13:03       It's cloudy. We're going to miss it. This is not going to work because we're gonna we're going to get up there and we're not gonna be able to see through the clouds, but then you pass through the clouds and then you look up. Oh, that's nothing with what you're saying. Yeah. That's nothing. The only thing I can compare to this is Alaska have ever been to Alaska. Yes. Like faire. Fairbank's is unbelievable. I highly recommend people listening to this. I've never been to Hawaii and I want to go there. People have never been to. Alaska should go to Alaska if you have the man. Oh, no doubt, because it is. They sit, you know, they call it the last frontier and everything, but it really is. It's undiscovered areas. It's uncultivated areas and it's stunning. Yeah, it's amazing. I went salmon fishing with ari fear. We went up there this year in july and we caught salmon and did a gig up there and I fell in love with the place. It's incredible. Anchorage is incredible. Really fucking cool. People too. Like there's a. There's a quality to the people that live up there because they're. They're living in a legitimate wilderness, they have a city and that city is surrounded by absolute legit wilderness. Like someone on the university of anchorage campus last year got killed by a fucking moose.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       Yeah, it happens. A moose came on the campus and stomped someone to death and that's like part of their life. Well, that's the thing that the students are very competitive. I don't think that's what it was about. Mike birbiglia. Well, you think it was the same article that I will know I talked to. The guy was there. My friend is actually a professor at the university. I got a hit. I'm going to conan right now. I got to drive. There. Might have no wallet, has no wallet, so if you get in an accident, I'm screwed. And it's the same sort of situation is the last time you'll be doubly screwed. I'm. I'm worried about my whole day to be honest with you. You want conan tonight? Yes. Tonight. What time is it? Eleven on tbs and there's a new show after konan now. Doesn't somebody else have a show now? Pete holmes. Very funny. Pete holmes, has it started yet? Yeah, he's really funny. Yeah, no, I haven't really seen it. Yeah, it's not st pete.
