Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Do do five, four, three, two, one young. Jamie gave me the fake gun. Pointy fingers. So alive. Chris, Ryan, Hawaii, brother. I'm live. It's good to be live. Joe, you haven't gotten any of this interdimensional child molester. We'd yet.

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       I've been probed. I don't know who was doing it, but somebody was probing me. Interdimensionally. I'll tell you that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       Just about to talk about getting Alex Jones high on the podcast before we start. And I said save it. You got to say,

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       well see, I'm not that tuned into who he is. I, I just hear you know, occasionally Alex Jones is this right wing conspiracy guy and I never listened to him. So I saw you was on your show and I was working at home doing some shit around the house so I put it on youtube so I could actually see him doing this. Taking these things off the headphones on and off. Oh my God man. And like for the first hour, hour and a half, I was like, fuck this guy, about half of what he says actually kind of makes sense to me and he's obviously really smart. High Iq off the fucking charts, no doubt, but then he would just veer off and the more we add in whiskey got involved, the more it was just like, this is performance art. This is just nuts. Beyond that,

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       once he started, right, right before the podcast, man, I want to get a drink and he, he, he had some whiskey. Did he have some whiskey before I got here? I've been right as you got it right as I go. So I was already here and he's like, well before we get started, let me give it, let me get a drink real quick. And he went back and I had a drink with them. I'm like, listen, I'm not going to let them drink alone. We're going to do this. Right. But it was a dangerous proposition because Eddie Bravo was here and Eddie Bravo is Mexican and Joey Diaz says that Mexicans are basically a native Americans, which he's right. You know, like there's, there's Mexicans that were native Americans that bread with the Spanish. You would know more about this having lived in Spain and so that's why.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Yeah, I mean so. And when grid with Mexicans and Spaniard, I don't breed with anyone. Not really, but attempted breeding. I've gone through the motions. Yeah. But you know, they look like some of them look like people from Spain and some of them look like native Americans. It's kind of interesting, like Mexico is a kind of really diverse sort of a genetic line. Um, but so, you know, the old stereotype about native Americans that you can get them drunk and the Indian goes fucking crazy. Well, Eddie Bravo, who's Mexican. Joey Diaz is always saying you get them drunk. That fucking Indian comes out. And that is exactly what happened. Yeah. So we got Eddie drunk and he just went off the fucking rails with. He thinks the government sprain shit in the sky and he's been saying it forever, so, so much so that he's constantly got legs confirmation bias thing where he's constantly looking to confirm. So he just had this agenda that he had to talk to Alex Jones even after you talked about interdimensional child molesters,

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       right in Obama's mother sea sex work.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       Still crazy. Oh, he's awesome. I think people got a chance to see what I see in him because like, everybody's like, how can you be friends with Alex Jones? I'm telling you, he's a great guy. He's a great guy, he's a lot of fun and he's right about a lot of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:17       Well, the thing, alright, somebody emailed me this morning and they're like, uh, you know, because I had said, I tweeted like, Hey, this guy is actually making sense. And they were like, dude, he's like a. He denies the Sandy Hook massacre. Is that true? I don't know. Is that true? That's such, that's it. I mean, that's the kind of thing that for me, it's like if he's denying that, then fuck that guy. He's saying, you know, Obama's mother was a CIA sex worker. That's just funny. But the, I mean, I don't know. You know what? I think this is my, my take on him and I, like I said, I love this guy dearly.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       Um, I feel like he's a high high power corvette engine. Yeah. But some of the spark plugs are not totally connected. Yeah. So like the Obama's wife is a CIA, Mama's Mama was a cia sex slave and sandy hook and we've got the documents. There's a few of those things that get through where maybe if he had someone next to them going, let's look at this objective. He, isn't it possible that this could be the case or isn't it possible that that could be the case and it's the opposite of what he's got is millions of people saying, yeah, give us more of that. People fucking love conspiracy theories. They loved them, they loved them and you know, see, this is where I was.

Speaker 2:          00:04:31       I was surprised to be agreeing with them because. Because we do live in a conspiracy, it is a conspiracy. Modern civilization is a fucking lie. So I agree that, you know, where he saying like, you know, we're being. He was talking about sort of, I think he gets into lizard people and that kind of thing. He does. No, he doesn't get into lizard people. All right, well I'm David Eick. Oh, okay. I, I get into a super organisms, like I think we're embedded in a super organism. You and I've talked about this before, I think, and that's why we as a species are doing things that are detrimental to our own interests as individual human beings because we are embedded in the super organism just like our bacteria is embedded in us and you know, using the super organism, the earth itself, like what do you think?

Speaker 2:          00:05:20       It's technology too. And so, uh, I mean you and I and Duncan and talked about this a bunch and we were doing the shrimp parade thing because I see, I see it as the end of humanity and that is a negative thing because I kind of like, I like the way we lived for 200,000 years embedded in the environment like other animals and pretty fucking happy and living in the moment and all that, you know, uh, where it's, Duncan thinks it's great that we're spreading out into the universe and you know, even if we stopped being humans to do that, which is, it's a, it's a fascinating conversation. So anyway, I'm crazy too, is my point,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       right? So I think there's a certain amount of craziness that certainly called for. I don't think you're crazy. I think you're looking at like you're extrapolating, you're just looking at what's going on and they didn't mean it's really clear what you're saying is absolutely correct. We're not operating in the best interest of the species. Right. If we continue, do you just see this new crack in the fucking Holy Shit. It's grown over the last couple of months by like a mile and the things like the size of Delaware or something enormous. And if it breaks off Foxville just a gigantic floating iceberg like the size of a state might just head to Hawaii and fucking crash into it. Like this shocking animation reveals how massive hell a massive Antarctic crack has grown 17 miles in the last two months. Hold on, let's go back. Let's go back. Uh, and experts say it's now inevitable that it will create one of the biggest icebergs ever seen. Holy Shit. Inevitable size of Jamaica. Oh my God. Oh my God. Look at it. Oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:07:05       It would be so scary to see like a floating state in the ocean and Fukushima radiation is worse than ever, ever, and they don't know what to do. They have no idea how to contain it. Not all problems are solvable. No. Yeah. Well that Fukushima. It scares the shit out of me because they don't really know how to shut off a lot of those ancient power plants. The ones that they first correct created. Essentially they just have to keep running, like grow the fuck. Let whoever the fuck let them do that is so crazy. They don't know how to shut them off. We'll see so much. A technology is based on this idea that, you know, when we need, when we face the problem, we'll have an answer to it. You know, like the disposal of nuclear waste. Right. Well we'll figure that out. We'll shoot it into space or will.

Speaker 3:          00:07:48       We know they have. They've kind of figured out a way to turn nuclear waste into batteries. They turned it into diamonds that lasts for like they embedded into diamonds and it can last. What was it? The, the, the technology of the battery can last thousands of years. Really. Oh, it's amazing. And let's get on that. Well, there was a. Who was, which podcast was it that we were doing where someone was talking about a young scientist. Do you remember who was who? They were talking about a young scientist that has these incredible ideas. Oh yeah, I was there. I met him. That was the one I did in 2012 or 11. He, he does this little reactor in the backyard, essentially meant to many podcasts, but it was, it was fairly recently. Just go over the fairly recent podcasts and vice did a thing on him.

Speaker 3:          00:08:31       It was Shane Smith. There you go. Perfect. Is Shane Smith from vice? Yeah. Um, so maybe he's right or maybe people are right that we will come up with technology that's going to be able to figure out a way to solve these problems. Well, but it doesn't see that's the thing here we are Fukushima, we don't have the technology. We don't know how to solve it when we need it, you know, or a year ago or you know, and dump. We bear this radio, diamond batteries making good use of nuclear waste, so they're going to have these diamond battery that lasts for thousands of years, which is really incredible because what Shane Smith was saying is essentially we have enough nuclear waste to power the earth for thousands of years. Our civilization like we can literally stop. We can stop all production of batteries and all the different things that we're doing coal. Here's where we're getting into conspiracy shit again. They won't let us do it. They'll shut that shit down because it will lose jobs. Like right now they're trying to open coal mines again for fucks sake. You know, who's they? Coal miners. Coal Mine, uh, unions and coal mine presidents. And the guy, you know, Exxon, that guy from Exxon who's going to be secretary of state, tillerson. Wonderful. That's the guy who said, what's the point of saving the earth if humans have to suffer? Is that what he said? Yeah. Smart Guy.

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       Ridiculous person. Anyway. Well, I don't want to drag us down and depressing. Not Depressing. Yeah, I think we were right though that what you're saying about technology and about we're serving technology. I mean, I've been saying this for a long time that I essentially think that what we're doing is giving birth. We're, we're a larva form. Were like some sort of a butterfly that's gonna emerge or we will be a butterfly and a caterpillar. Right now we're creating the iphones and I'm a caterpillar going. God Damn it. I liked the color stage, but you don't want to lose it. Don't you think those single celled organisms like guys, what are we doing? We're branching out. We're fucking joining together with other cells. Fuck that man. I liked being by myself being essentially immortal, immortal, single celled squid. It could be, but when you're, you're, uh, advancing stage requires the destruction of your entire environment and all the other species as well.

Speaker 3:          00:10:47       That's kind of fucked. It is fucked. But I don't know if it's all the species. I think rats will be fine if he watched that netflix documentary on rats. Yeah. No, I saw you posted some shit and I was like, Nina and I want to see that. It is amazing. It has no rats will be fine. Keith Richards, there'll be fine cockroaches. I need 25 percent of the species have gone extinct in the last generation. Something like that. Well, that always happens though. See, this is not at this rate. No, I mean this is a mass extinction event, but there's always been mass extinction events. There's been a ton of them and there's 90 percent of everything that's ever lived as dead everything, every living organism. But that's obscuring the reality, right? The rate of extinction right now due to human interventions is higher than it's been in probably hundreds of millions of years.

Speaker 3:          00:11:35       Young Jamie can look at a case. So the last major extinction event was, you know, hundreds of millions of years ago, I think it was 65 million years ago. The thing is that dinosaurs, I think it was the what, what killed off the dinosaurs and there was also a major extinction event in North America that coincided with the end of the Ice Age, about 10 fold. Right? Which they attributed to humans. No, no, they don't anymore. Yeah. Well some people do, but what they're thinking now due to a lot of geological data is asteroidal impacts. Oh, we were at Randall Carson. Is he on that? Yeah, I never bought that human thing. I think this whole man, the hunter bullshit. Cause like they didn't even have bows and arrows. They have adult models, which are cool. They're cool. They're pretty cool invention. Good luck. That's the fucking saber tooth tiger with that. The last one too.

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       They're like five left and you're going to hunt them down and kill them. I don't think so. It just wasn't enough people here to do that and it's much more likely considering the fact they found these essentially like graveyards filled with wooly mammoths had died instantaneously. The asteroid impact theory also a lot of, um, you know, the big game died, the, the giant, the carnivores. The big giraffes and all that shit that was here, but also a lot of shellfish went extinct at the same time and snails and things like that. Here we go. Extinctions during human error. Worse than thought the gravity of the world's current extinction rate becomes. It becomes clear upon knowing what it was before people came along. A new estimate finds of species die off as much as 1000 times more frequently nowadays than they used to. It's 10 times worse than the old estimate of 100 times who, oh, that's not good, and that's three years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       This is a three year old article in that funny, like three years ago, people like shit's old bro. Shit's from September Bro. Isn't it funny? We're. We're moving at such a fast rate that our minds are kind of tuned into that and when anybody. Someone shows you something, it's from a year ago. You're like, Bro, you're quoting a year old stuff. Tell me about. I'm trying to write a book, like talk about an ancient technology. It's like I'm trying not to refer to papers that were published 10 years ago, but you know, how can you not, I mean there's crazy 10 years ago is nothing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Darwin was a long fucking time ago.

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       What we're looking at is this weird accelerated existence and it's, it's happening right in front of it and we sort of acknowledged it, but we're not recognizing it. We've acknowledged it. What we can't comprehend it now, like we're living in a world we can't comprehend, which again gets back to this whole hunter gatherer thing. Like you lived in a world they understood, you know, this whole, like we assume the generational, uh, misunderstanding or sort of common human behavior, human experience. But if you're a hunter gatherer, your parents and grandparents lived in the same world you live in and they do now. I mean, you saw that recently, uncontacted tribe like recently contacted tribe in Brazil. I mean, it's incredible. They're there, they're live there. They're a, they're a time capsule. They're living the way people lived 100,000 years ago. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah, it's really cool. It's really. The pictures are amazing. Cds, people pointing, bows and arrows, and helicopters. What have you ever heard? There's a great book called at play in the fields of the Lord by Peter Matheson's. I've heard of it. I've never read it. It's a beautiful bug man.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       It's a really good film to Daryl Hannah, John Lithgow, Kathy Bates, amazing cast. Um, but, uh, it's about, it's a novel, but it's about this, uh, these two guys. Oh, Tom Waits is one of the actors in the play pilots. They're like smugglers, whatever. And they get hired to go in and bomb this uncontacted tribe before the missionaries make contact with them because once they are contacted then all their land gets set aside as a reserve and this corrupt politician wants to log in and mine and you know, all the shit. So he hires these two ne'er do wells to go in and bomb them. Well, and uh, I mean, I'm not ruining the story. This is like the first 20 pages. You get the setup and what happens is they, they, uh, they go out and they sort of fly over the first day and they see, they see the clearing in the jungle and all the Indians run into the jungle and then they're sort of flying low.

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       There may be a thousand feet up and this one warrior runs into the clearing and fires an Arrow at the airplane and they're laughing like this fucking guy thinks he's going to shoot down an airplane with an Arrow, you know, and they go back to the village and one of the pilots, it's Tom Waits and I'm forget the other actor, but he plays a Navajo and they're like Vietnam vets bombing around South America with their plane, right? And they're back in the village and I get shit faced. And then the Tom waits character goes to bed and the other guy's still hanging out in this little bar and somebody slips him. Some IOWASCA. And so he's already drunk. He drinks this Iowasca heats, like, starts hallucinating. He goes out, gets in the airplane, flies off in the air in the middle of the night, flies out to this spot in the jungle where they saw where they're supposed to bomb them that day.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       Instead he puts on a parachute, ditches the plane, jumps out. Oh my lands in the jungle, takes off all his clothes and his pistol, buries it in the jungle and then walks naked into the village to spoiler alert. No, no. That's the beginning of the movie beginning. Hold on a second. I'm writing this down as young as he sexy bitch. Look at them. Yeah. And what was this? The film 90. Wow. I was fresh out of John Lithgow. Yeah. Yeah. Um, anyway, that's, that's how it begins. Peter Matheson's a great writer. He uh, he was a hard hardcore dude. Real bad ass guy. But anyway, um, that's how it starts. So, so this guy literally goes back in time, right? Because he's a Navajo and when he saw that guy shoot the Arrow, he sort of had this vision of how his people had lost their dignity and their culture had been destroyed. And if only they had known what they were facing and these people in the jungle, I have no idea what's coming for them. Right. And so his mission is I'm going to go back and save them because I can tell them what's coming. I can, you know, move through worlds. I can move back in time and it's fucking wild. What a great plot. Jesus Christ high right now. Scaring

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       the shit out of me. So La Man, I'm back in La. What happened? I thought you were going to be an ex. Pat. You're going to fucking get out of here before the big one landed a. yeah, I'm still, I'm watching. I'm watching very closely at all before they close the door. I'm gonna I gotta weigh out. What's it like coming back right at the time when Donald Trump becomes president? It's an adventure, Huh? It's strange. The. I feel like I was saying this on my podcast the other day. I feel like the like, you know how the solar system is moving, you know the whole galaxy is moving. So there are all these zones. I gotta be careful, man. I'm talking about don't be countered. Don't be careful. There's no need to be careful. Think about Tom Waits. Is it Tom Waits? Is that the name of the actor? No, that's the center. Tom Waits and Tom Barrett. He's the same guy. The same guy. Okay. And then Tom Berenger who was in saving private Ryan, right. Or platoon platoon. He was the bad guy and platoon with a scar on his face and I think so, yeah, it was great.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       Speaking of mediators, did you guys see this in Michigan at the other day? Yeah, I did. Yeah. A giant fucking hunk of metal from the sky slammed into a or something from this guy slammed into Lake Michigan. Look at that. That might've actually burned out before it hit the ground. So you see it like kind of fizzle and towards the end it's amazing what the atmosphere does. Just things coming through the atmosphere. Like remember when the space shuttle lost some tiles and then burned out in the atmosphere. I'm good Jim. It's just amazing that our air just traveling through the air at a high rate of speed destroys things. It just rips them apart, you know, burns him up. Yeah. Well, the, the threat of the impact for something that's in space is ever looming and always ignored mean we rarely think about it until something like this happens and I think it's just so scary that there's part of our brain that just puts it off.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       We just go. Yeah, and then move on to the next thing. Nothing you could do about it. It's definitely going to happen. It's happened before you look up at the moon. There's an amazing video that Neil degrasse Tyson posted on his instagram page the other day and it's a guy using a camera and he has some incredible lens on it. Oh yeah, I saw that. And you, you, you mean he's got a really good camera and you get really cool by the way, that might not be nailed to God. The grass Tyson's actual page. I think it might be like a fan page because it links up to twitter and the twitter is Neil degrasse Tyson fan, so it might not be his real instagram page. Well, whatever. It's an awesome video and it gets to a really close up when it gets really close up. The thing you see is just craters everywhere. Well, there's no atmosphere to protect them. Exactly. But then what? Drop the charges dropped

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       and then you start thinking about how much shit is out there. Like that thing is just covered. It's just covered with but time. Think about how long it's been out there to. You know, I'm the one I'm worried about is the solar flare. Oh yeah. You know because that was it like 1880 or something. There was a big one in North America and it melted out the transmission cables for the claymores cohorts code guys the Telegraph. So when that hits, like all our computers are gone now, computers are our grid. Yeah. The transformers are out. So they're saying if something like that does happen and you can never predict if or when it would take months to get power back up. Yeah. And people live in Phoenix in August, they're fucked. Yeah. I mean [inaudible] you live in a cold place, at least you could burn wood.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       I mean, people did that for a long time. They figured out fire. There was actually an article recently about neanderthals and they're trying to figure out when there's still a debate as to whether or not they actually knew how to make fire or whether they knew how to keep it lit or once they found it right, you know that they would find it. It would be like the sacred fire and they would keep it lit, but they weren't quite smart enough to actually make it, but now they're thinking that might not be the case. They might have had a lot of debate on that. Yeah. You studied a lot of ancient civilizations. How much, how much debate is there? Like whenever I hear someone say people definitely did this. They definitely did that. You know, like when they're looking back at evidence like as far as far as like who could handle fire?

Speaker 4:          00:22:23       Like who was the first people in, when did they figure it out, how do they put all that shit together? Well, I mean it depends on the specific case. Right. With in the case of fire with they're looking at is uh, and, and also because it's so, there's such a scarcity of evidence. Things change really quickly, right? Like for a long time, they thought people crossed over, the first few North Americans are about 10,000 years ago and now they're saying, oh, at least 14. And now they're finding places in Chile what appear to be 40,000 and other union, they came over in boats and there were several different, you know, groups that came in different ways. So there's a lot of change in that because there's so little evidence that when a new piece comes in, it really radically transformed things. But with fire, what they're looking at is, um, evidence of fire concurrent with human habitation.

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       So with carbon dating, you can figure out the age of the coals or the stuff that's left in the ash. Um, and then you'd look at pieces of bone or something that they were cooking. And if you get the same area then you can figure, okay, they were, this wasn't a fire 10,000 years after somebody ate a rat here or something. Right there cooking yet, especially if the bones show charring as well, then they're cooking the food, but that's just in the last 15 or 20 years. The estimate of human use of fire has gone from like

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       500,000 years to a million. Isn't that crazy? They just keep back dating things. Yeah, so fascinating. Just to those mounds they found in the Amazon really recently they used drones and they were getting these photographs, drones or satellites or getting these images from space from, from above rather show like grids and they show all these. These structures that they previously had never recognized. Didn't notice. Some of them look like stonehenge in the same sort of shape. Apparently. There's like irrigation canals and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. They have no idea who, uh, what's this? Yeah. I have this idea it. I have a lot of. I need like a bunch of graduate students because I have ideas for books, but I never get around to writing the story of my life should be like, I need a stat. You should be like a guy who tells it like, people, we need to work on this.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       If you're curious but you're not disciplined or you don't have the time, honestly, ideas, but in between doing your podcast, writing your book and live in your life, how much time do you have left? Live in my life. Takes up a lot of time. You, I appreciate that about you. I really do. I appreciate that. You, uh, you have a very um, very. It's an intelligent but it's an honest way of looking at time. You know, you don't have like this overwhelming ambition and you don't have like this overwhelming desire to be recognized or anything like that, but you do have an overwhelming desire to have fun and be comfortable and be curious. So you're saying I'm a lazy fucking hippies. Were you? You're having a good time. I think you might be doing it right. I get all the people that I know that are super smart.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       You like the least stress. Super Smart Dude. I know. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I quote you on that, on my next book, but man, I mean considering you're always around, you always enjoy in different parts of the world. You're always coming back with these crazy stories and interesting perspectives are you gathered up, but you don't seem stressed and so many people that I know that are like in your intellectual realm are fucking freaking out all the time. To me. I mean, if I'm stressed, it's. I get stressed by my lack of stress. That's my biggest problem. I think you're built for podcasts. I really do. I think your, your mind and your curiosity, it's like you're, you're trapped in this medium. I mean, it's not that I don't think your book is Great. I thought sex at dawn was amazing. Why do I keep coughing? Is that the weed? Sex at dawn was amazing, but uh, you, you're really well suited for podcasts. You're really well suited for freeform conversations. You can tell you enjoy it, you know? And again, it's not very stressful. No, that's what I love about it. I did one last night. I, I occasionally do a, what I call a Roma renting out my ass episode

Speaker 4:          00:26:45       and it's where it's just me. No gas. Right? So last night I did, when I'm drinking beer, I'm like reading letters from people and yeah, and going off on whatever the fuck I'm going off on and it occurred to me later like that, you know, I'm not dealing with the kind of numbers you're dealing with, but you know, I've got a stadium of people listening to me fucking stadium, but I am more relaxed than if I were talking to a friend on the phone because I don't see anybody. I'm just alone drinking a beer, talking into this microphone and I don't feel the presence of anyone listening. So I'm totally fucking relaxed sometimes to my detriment. I probably say things I shouldn't say and share shit that I've meant to keep private or whatever. But it's, it is a weird thing. I mean Jamie and I were talking about this earlier, like when you said, Hey Chris, you, it's been awhile to come.

Speaker 4:          00:27:37       This is like, yeah, I'm going to go hang out with my buddy joe. Yeah. But there are a fucking million people hovering around here listening to us. You know, it's really weird, like 90 percent of my friendship with you has taken place here. I know, right? It's so. And it's the same worries, the same Moshe Kasher. I've got all these friends who I only see when we're on a fucking mind, you know, it's really interesting is Duncan and I, we were having a really hard time spending time together because he's always busy. We'd have a really hard time with only a few times we got together and just hung out as friends over the last couple of years, but we did so many podcasts together for that and we'd have these conversations. Like one of the things that's unique about this form is that you have these conversations that are like so isolated from any distraction and I don't think that exists anywhere else anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:28:27       Good point. Just to people looking at you. That's why I don't like when people look at their phones. I don't like when people like bring a laptop or something like that. It's like, man, I try to close mine now. I used to not. I used to look at it. It's not smart. The smart thing to do is just put it down and this form of conversation that collect the kind of like I would encourage people to have podcasts, have their own podcast, not even if they want to read, they don't. You don't even have to release it, but by doing it, but just the act of doing it, you're, you're having these conversations, these extended conversations with people and I think it, it exercises your thought process in a way and the engagement process. It focuses your mind. People used to say, some famous writer said, I write to see what I think, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:29:11       I think podcasting sort of the same. The way you're describing it, it's true. It's, it's one place where we turn off all the distractions and just focus. I, my plan now is to get a van. I want to get a sprinter van and like put a bed in it and a little kitchen with the country, travel the country doing podcasts. Ooh, that's a great idea. And I had this other idea because because I see you've got enough weight that people will come to you, but I don't want to do shit on skype and phone and I hate. I hate that. Yeah. It feels weird, right? Yeah. There's delays

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       and you're talking over each other and you can't see the body language. You don't know if they're disengaging from what you're talking about or they're getting uncomfortable. Maybe you're getting too personal, you know, I really like being in a room with somebody. Also, the kind of people that I have on my podcast are like, you, they're people you want to know. They're interesting. Fucking people, you know. So I want to like hang out and meet their friends and meet the husband or the wife and the kids and sit in the driveway in my van for a few days and get to know the crowd. And I was thinking I'd love to meet. Um, what's his name? Dan In bisbee. Your buddy. Uh, that Santa Get up. I'd love to. And Bimbo. Bimbo. Bingo. Yeah, you can love them. My Buddy, uh, Jake Johansen. Do Comedians Love Jake? Jake's green guy, so I was at his house and he, we were talking about how comics think differently because I was like, I love hanging out with you guys because nobody gets offended about anything. You can just say whatever the fuck comes out of your head out of your mind. Right. And he was like, we were talking about podcasts and I said something about Stan Hope, and he's like, dude, you gotta listen to the cliffhanger episodes. Have you heard those? Know?

Speaker 2:          00:30:54       What did he do? Oh my God, there it was like three years ago, I went back into the archives and archives and found them. He had this thing where he has this couple living in the house in the backyard and like they'd met by chance and then it turned out that he had fucked the woman 15 years earlier after a gig in Reno or something. And so now she's with her boyfriend and they're living in the backyard and they're all buddies and the four of them are all the two couples I guess had a sexual thing and it was all cool and it was just really beautiful. And they're talking about how they met in the history of the relationship and all that. The boyfriends there, the girlfriend's not there. It turns out the girlfriends in the hospital about to have open heart surgery. That was the cliffhanger.

Speaker 2:          00:31:40       Holy Shit. So at the end of this hour and a half, two hour conversation where they're talking about this, you know, this relationship with it turns out like she's going to have open heart surgery. She might be dead. Folks tune in next week to find out if she's dead and they're laughing, but they're laughing and this was jake's point. They're processing grief through laughter and that there is nothing new. And they're not denying how intense and sad and scared they are. But they're still laughing, isn't it? Finally grief over death is one of the few things where we demand you behave a certain way. Well, they're Irish wakes right where everybody gets drunk and laughs. Yeah. But Intel's crazy body stories about the dead guy. That's how you celebrate the life. Hm. That's a good way. Yeah. I think it's a very. This imposed sadness, this sort of seriousness. I think he's very sort of Protestant. Yeah, there's, there's

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       a little bit of that, but there's also, I think we want to know who feels bad, you know, because if you don't feel bad like tribally, I think that's a very dangerous person to have around. Like say if you die, it's like a psychopath or something. Yeah. I really think that might be something to that. Like we might enforce it and there might be like this urge and instinct to enforce extreme grief because we feel like people who, who don't feel that are either not on my team really didn't care about the person that I cared about or might be a psycho. Right. Interestingly, some cultures have professional mourners like greet you, how chip Pan, you know, you pay him to come to the funeral and they'll, we'll and scream and cry and express the emotion so the other people can just sort of chill and wow, you know, go to the buffet.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       Did you see after Kim Jong, Il, Kim Jong Il died in North Korea, that people were being punished because they didn't mourn hard enough. They got six month jail sentences because they didn't mourn hard enough and they were just the worst fake acting like all throughout the streets and they're filming it for their propaganda films, but it's like, see if he could pull some of it up. It's kind of hilarious. It's hilarious and terrifying. North Korea terrifies me and one of the things that terrifies me the most about it is that it is in our face everyday direct evidence that things could go terribly wrong at any point in time with human beings and we got so fucking lucky that we're born who at wherever you are that you can listen to this and not have to worry about being locked up for possessing it, whether it's in England or Norway or Canada or wherever you're listening to this.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       We got sold lucky. You could've easily been bored in North Korea. Any of us can be born in a prison in North Korea where you're born as a prisoner and you'll die as a prisoner and that's going on right now. In 2017, there is a fucking military dictatorship and they're killing people and imprisoning people. And the lights are off at night when you fly over it and they take satellite footage of it. You see the lights are all off like these people wailing on the street. Immediate is fucking Uber Bizarre there. They're all on their knees. Whaling, but not a god damn tier to be seen. They're just throwing their. I mean, they're probably scared to that they're going to be beaten if they don't. Well hard enough. So they're scared of that. Oh, that'll make you curse is the emotion. But this is, this is unbelievable that human beings no different than us. There's no difference between them and us. They're just there. Yeah. That guy could be your neighbor. Like one of those people wailing could be, you know, Francis, your neighbor, and you could be this awesome guy. Like, dude, what's up man? How are you? Oh, everything's good. You know, blah, blah, blah. Same Guy. Could be the same guy, just got born and a better, better spot. These are all women. Oddly enough, this is all women whaling. Oh, there's some men that they have to separate

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       so they don't fuck with it. You don't want any fucking monkey business while you screaming, look at these guys crying, looking at, uh, it's so strange, so strange, but this is happening today, so I understand this a different part of the world, but you got to, we have to all recognize that it's just dumb luck that we were born here because there's these systems that exist whenever you have gigantic groups of people that are at least fairly isolated and these systems, these operating systems, they, they, they get enforced and it doesn't matter where they are. Once they get enforced, they're super difficult to break like those surrey women who cut their lip and stick those plates in them and stretch their lips out and do like, that's a part of a system that exists in that area. And that system is the women are trying to get away from it now.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       And a lot of women are like, I don't want to slobber all the time. I don't want to knock my teeth out to put some fucking stupid plate in this. I heard of a tribe where women, um, laser the hair off their pussies. Oh, I heard about that when sometimes they wax it right and the usage of shade it and they were the shoes with like a big stick in the back so they can't walk. Yeah, it's incredible. The things people will do in the women wear these like really short skirts. I described like Megan Kelly's outfit and my bit was a bit I'm working on right now that I talk about what she's wearing. It's basically a vagina curtain. I saw your bit the other night. That literally is what it is. It's just these beautiful women on TV, on the news, and they were wearing something that just.

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       There's, you know of could lift that up and fuck her with it. That's part of the. That's part of the skirt is lift. That's the whole point of it. That's why that fatal attraction scene with Susan, what was in it and that Susan Sharon, Sharon stone, it was so impactful because we've all imagined that a million times, you know? Yeah, yeah. Know she did. Look at that. Kick the fuck out of dodge. If she didn't have that clipboard, they're blocking the light. The glorious light. Look at this. This is crazy, man. That's crazy. That's a crazy outfit. That is a sexy outfit and I like her. I think she's very smart. Very interesting woman and I'm, I'm curious to see what happens to her now that she's at NBC. Maybe she'll come on the Joe Rogan experience. I don't want it to be cross from around stammer stammer a pan.

Speaker 3:          00:38:07       You can do it from a remote location. We have to do that one by skype. I don't be calling me and I guess I could handle it. I can do it. I have a thing for ice princesses as long as I said Hi. Do you like the Ice Princess? Something about me that uh, I think that I like are very powerful, articulate woman like that. It's very, very exciting. We'll see. [inaudible]. That's it. You're the opposite of me. You were saying I'm like the stress free. You kinda got your, all about the challenge. Only something I'm not like, I'm not trying to fuck her or anything

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       like that. I like, not that, that kind of challenge, but I am fascinated that you came here from working out. Yeah, right. You know, and then like you, because it's funny you talked about my life being like this sort of carefree easy going thing. I think of you, you're like, you're like the Martha Stewart of men or something. Like you do everything. How do you do you're living like I dropped your name occasionally and someone will be like, oh, the podcast guy. Like, yeah. Yeah. And like his friend will go away. I thought he was the UFC guy. Yeah. Yeah. That too. Like, but wait isn't either, like you have nine lives and you're living them all. How the fuck do you do that? I don't know. Your efficiency. You never sleep. Plus you're a father, you're a husband. I do all that stuff. I just, I think it's, it's an illusion that it takes more time than it does with all the stuff that I do.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       I don't have a job. Job Chill. Fuck yeah. Real. When I watched like documentaries and shit, but see that's a chill and that's why I can't chill, chill, chill. Just like getting your hammock and put your hands behind your head and go do, do, do, do you ever do that? My brain doesn't work like that so that my brain's like my day to do something. Come on, shower. I love showers. You take long, like a nice 10 minute hot shower, pleasure and showers. Do you have like a good shit in the shower and that's your chill time? I went to Alaska to Prince of Wales. No. Yeah, yeah. Prince of Wales Island and uh, it is this unbelievably wet spot and it rains there more than I think anywhere else in North America. It's incredible. I mean it's just constantly drenched with southeast. I don't know. I don't know where it is geographically.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       I flew in for this TV show mediator with my friend Steven Rinella and my friend Brian Cowen and Yonis retell us and we went to this island. It was amazing. It was amazing experience. So beautiful and so remote and so crazy. And it wasn't even a successful hunting trip, but it was amazing. The experience was amazing, but one of the most amazing things about it was that I was wet and uncomfortable in this weird sort of environment where you never really get dry because it's constantly raining for five or six days and then when I got home I was so happy. I was so happy. I was happy in a way that I'd never been before in a way, during a regular day, just driving down the street to the studio and coming in and hanging out with Jamie and doing a podcast and I just felt so good. I felt so good. You felt good to be back or just that? It wasn't. I feel good to be back. It was. I feel good. I feel really good and I think that especially for California, the weather here is so god damned good that we have a few days where it rains and people literally start to complain and I'm like, do you know how crazy it is that you're complaining that it rains maybe 10 days a year out of 365, and the [inaudible] latest so beautiful after they're cleared. Yeah. It's amazing. There's no bugs.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Okay. I mean this place is so easy to get by with. There's very little wildlife that were ever concerned with. We just live this ideal. It can idolic what's the word? Have delicate. A delicate sounds wrong though, doesn't it? It's not an idol. It's an ideal. We live a fairytale life for anywhere. Anyone else anywhere in the world. And I think just coming here from the rain soaked island, like as I was driving around, I was, I would realize like, oh, at least for me, I have to go through some intense struggle to appreciate normal existence. There is no Yang without yen. That's for me for sure. And there's no comfort without discomfort. So for me, like for me to be happy and calm and like sit here and talk to you. I, I all beat the fucking shit out of a heavy bag for an hour.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       So the, I wish wail on that thing. I wish I had that hunger. I that need. I've got friends like I can't, I can't relax if I don't run three miles a day. Like fuck, I wish I had that. I can read. I can get out of bed and go right to the hammock. I'm fine. I don't need to do interval. It's good. It's good that you could do that and it isn't. It isn't. See that's. I don't get shit done. I need more of that because a, I'd get more shit done, but then it's like, why get shit done? You know, like what am I trying to get to if I'm already there? It's, that's why I think podcasts are your shit. Yeah. Because effortless. Just turn it on and do it and maybe like the way you're doing it with that ranting. The Roma one, that's a great idea.

Speaker 3:          00:43:05       Bill bird does that and it's incredibly entertaining. Bill Burrs, podcasts, one of the best podcast you'll ever listen to and it's always just him. It was watch when he's on your show. You guys have a good thing. I love him. He's amazing. And his new comedy. Netflix special rather is out now. It's called a walk your way out. So right now I haven't seen any yet, but I saw him do all that material, so I'm sure it's going to be fucking amazing. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, he's, you know, he's a hard worker to know that guy. Um, he works on efforts for family. He's got his own animated show. He works on that, works on Standup, does this podcast twice a week by himself. He just had a kid recently, just had a kid recently. Intense family thing going on, a lot going on. Great Guy. Just a great guy.

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       It is funny. I mean Jamie and I were talking about this earlier, how like La, I've been here a couple months now so I'm sort of getting my head back into it. Everything's the opposite here. Like even to the point where people think like, oh, you're living in la. They're picturing Hollywood where you live and where I live it's fucking owls and coyotes. It doesn't look like. Especially if you live where you live is one of the most awesome spots around love. It's ridiculous. It's like Montana or something crazy. Yeah, it's beautiful. So lot of hippies though, a lot of hippies, but you don't see them. They smell dude, I was sick, I was walking, but there's a lot of fresh air, so they're outdoors. That's like a dirty dog. It doesn't offend you. Don't get that close to. Exactly. I was uh, I was hiking up in the hills

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       in Topanga couple of weeks ago and I'm sitting there on this trail taking, uh, taking in the view and I hear these two guys coming up the trail and they can't see me because there's, you know, a curve and they're talking and the one guy says, so are you feeling anything yet? And the other guy's like, well, my legs feel a little funny, but you know, either he took Viagra and they're going to go to the woods to fuck. I didn't even occur to me. I don't know. I don't know why it occurred to you. You ready to do this or feel anything yet? He loosening up. Yeah, it was a bit that he used to do, but edibles. Whereas like the worst thing you could ever hear someone say I've taken out of hole is I don't feel shit. I'm gonna. Take another one. I don't do that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:16       It's always the case, right? When people just feel it. Not really. We'll go one more fuck it. And then an hour and a half later you're in terror. Just a deep, deep state of terror. Yeah. I was called in to consult on a case in Spain with a guy that was in a mental hospital and I'm the psychiatrist who was treating him was a friend of mine and knew that I took a lot of drugs and this guy didn't, hadn't taken any drugs, so he's like, could you just come in and like talk to this guy and see what you think, you know. So I meet with the guy and I'm like, so what's your story, man? He's like, well look, I was in Amsterdam and I ate a Brownie and I wasn't feeling anything. And so then I took these mushrooms and you know. And next thing I know I woke up, I was in the jail cell naked.

Speaker 4:          00:46:07       I started walking down this. Apparently they told me I was screaming and singing it. I was like, so are you all right man? He's like, yeah, I'm fine, but everyone thinks I'm crazy because of this thing. And it's just like I get. I keep telling him it's deal like the guy from the Tom Berenger mother. Yeah, exactly. So I talked to my. Are you guys flying? The guy's not crazy. He just like ate too many fucking brownies in Amsterdam. It happens to everybody, but if you eat brownies too many brownies and mushrooms together, but they work together though. That's one of the interesting things about marijuana and psilocybin. They're very complimentary. Like that was what Mckenna used to do when he would take a mushroom trip, he would eat the mushroom and then he would wait for it to kick in and while he was waiting for it to kick in, he would roll joints and so he would just roll a shitload of joints and then just start smashing the joints and then the marijuana would sort of like reach out and grab the silicide that and embrace it and just create this tornado of awesomeness and that's how we used to trip and he used to do it by himself.

Speaker 4:          00:47:14       Mckenna's thing was about silent darkness. Really concerned with experiencing the psychedelic state in a very undisturbed manner. Like to him, the idea of taking mushrooms going to amusement was insane.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       He had no desire to do anything like that. It just wanted to figure out. And I think, what is the quote? Each time he would try to see how much more he could stand and he would do that for a while. Maybe he was describing another guy when he's talking about that now that I think about it, but he was a, like a proponent of five dried grams. He would. He called it heroic dose. Yeah. That fucking heroic dose got me in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       I was reading Mckenna and I got this acid from a friend of mine that I can't talk about where it came from, but it was like one of these sources where it's like, Whoa, Holy Shit. Like really from that source. Okay. Right from Albert Hoffman's lab pretty much that kind of thing. Yeah. So, uh, [inaudible] like I'm used to be very embedded in that world of like scientists who were doing hallucinogenic research and stuff. Anyway. So I, I can't tell the whole story, but I, I decided to take a heroic dose because it was like, Eh, I'm not going to do a lot more acid in my life. Might as well, like go out with a bang, and I took the stuff and how much you take, whether it was liquid a. funnily enough, what happened was I, this psychiatrist who was a friend of mine, he hadn't done any drugs since the sixties. Back in the days when you could order acid from Sandoz and they'd send it to you, Jesus Christ. How long did that last? That lasted until it was made illegal in 64, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       I thought it was all. What didn't lsd go down with that sweeping psychedelic acts of 1970 or could've been later. Was that maybe lsd went down before that went on afterwards? I don't know. There was a bunch of them that were made illegal in 70. Even ones that aren't even

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Nixon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, in any case they, you know, it was marketed. LSD was marketed to doctors and two psychiatrists and psychologists who would take it in order to experience psychosis so they could better treat their patients. It was called a psychotomimetic, so you could just order it and take it and like, oh, this is what it's like to be psychotic and understand that, but you think about, I mean from a medical perspective, think about the nobility of that, like what a cool doctor and what an interesting time where it was like, hey, we all need to experience nine hours of insanity, so that will be better. Or psychiatrist. That's a pretty fucking cool thing. That is very cool. Very cool way of looking at it, right? Yeah. It's a lifeguard who jumps into the water and not a lifeguard who stands on the beach and throws you a pill, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:50:15       Yeah. If you talk to a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist doesn't have any psychedelic experiences, you you can understand it because you know, especially if you're an academic, you want to be respected. Psychedelic experiences for the most part are illegal and you know, people get weird about it and I can understand wanting to keep it under wraps, but if you're not really interested in it at all, how much are you studying the mind? Exactly and you not. Experiential evidence is invalid. I mean, come on. It's very valid. We know that there's some extreme effects that happen with some very potent psychedelics. Like, um, uh, was a sage. What is, what is it called? What are they called? Salvia. Salvia. Salvia divinorum, which is essentially sage, right? Yeah. That's, that stuff will blow your fucking mind. And that shit was available in head shops just a few years. One of the most potent psychedelics known to man, I think it was Ari who had.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       He did it and he, he had a life. He lived a whole life, like three years. He felt like he lived a life. He had friends, he had girlfriends. He broke up with him. He had jobs like the whole deal, that matrix. And then he came back and he was only gone for like 10 minutes on this couch on a Salvia trip. Do we isolate that? A clip? Is that what you're looking for? Yeah, it. There's a clip of him doing it and then he talked about what happened later. I think it was with you. Yeah. I want to dunk into podcasts, but here's the clip of him doing it. Yeah. Brian's old podcast, naughty show, Sam Tripoli's podcast on Brian's death squad network. And so he uh, res. So he's gone there and they're all laughing and talking. Hee Hee, ha ha. Well this guy's trip and his balls off like he's in another dimension.

Speaker 5:          00:52:18       Tell him I tell him. Take him off. I'm not joking. I'm serious actually. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine buddy. Get away

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       from him. We'll leave him alone. Oh my God. He was tripping so hard. Did he think he was like suffocating? I don't know at that. Explains the Turlock podcast during the podcast. He explained it suffering there, but what happened is they just probably talking too much and it probably snapped out of it and it was in the middle of this haze of reality and the illusion. I think doing something like that, like you got to be around people who are going to be quiet, you know, when you do it, you know they're quiet and when they do it, you're quiet. Sit there. Yeah, I did. Uh, after I saw you, I saw you about a year ago. I think I went from here to Mexico. I went to that Ibogaine

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       clinic in Tijuana. Ah, you did? Huh? I didn't do the experience. I want to see what it was like. Yeah. I was doing a podcast with a doctor who works there and I met some people down there who had, um, five meo DMT, the painter or the toad thing. And I did that. That was a, that was really intense. I'd never done dmt before. I asked her but never smoked dmt five. Mel was the really weird stuff because it's very empty. You, you go away, you go, you go to the center of the university, become everything I guess. Yeah. How strong. I mean, how much of a dose did you get? Did you blast off? Blast it off? Did you feel like that? Like you were gone the first few minutes or you know, who knows how many minutes or time, whatever, but the first period, yeah, there was that sort of ego dissolution where it's not me having this experience, it's just fucking experience right now.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       It's just what it is. Just colors and shapes and around holy fuck. Right. But that in my case, and this just reminded me of it, watching already there, in my case, what happened was I got overwhelmed by sadness like I've because people, some people I'm close to are going through really heavy shit in the last couple of years and you know, you sorta, you feel compassion and you check in with them and you, you compassion literally means to feel together. Right? And so you feel that with them. But on another level it's like I'm not the one who's got ms, you know, I'm not the one who's got chronic pain and suffering all this shit. Um, so there's a separation. But what I experienced with that was the absence of separation. And I was just immersed in the sadness of people I love and you know, seeing them suffering and not being able to help them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:16       And it was overwhelming man. I mean I cried like a baby literally. Wow. And uh, and then I started coming out of it and the room was quiet and he was candlelight and all this and the person who was sort of overseeing it was really nice and you know, sort of, okay, you're starting to feel better now and here's the tissue and whatever. And then the music came on and my first thought, my first conscious thought was, remember when I write the yelp review of this experience to mention that the music should be different because the music sucked. It was shit, new age shit music. And I was like, if you're going to play music, play some fucking Bach or something, play some Yani or whatever the fuck this is. But my, you know, I, not that I use yelp a lot, but it was just sort of like, you know, remember to mention this. This could improve the experience for other people. You know what the, what a weird way of thinking. That's a very weird way of thinking. So I had like this super profound experience encased in the

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       most trivial bullshit imaginable. I guess. Stan hope. Did that five Meo dmt back when you could buy it online. Yeah. And he did it at my place. We did it together, but he had never done it before. I had done it a few times when he and I did it and he did it and I've never seen anybody get hit by it harder. Like he literally, he was like slumped on my couch and he was making. He was groaning like it was, it was disturbing. It was. It was. So, it was so extreme that I was wondering like, I knew that this is something that the human body makes. I knew that it's one of the most transient drugs ever observed in the body. Your body brings it back to baseline really quickly, but not at that dosage. It, he didn't take that much in, take any more than I took, but it hit him like a Goddamn mack truck. And uh, he came out of it and he just kept saying, life, life just becomes life and then eats life becomes life and just life just becomes, this just goes on. It just goes on, goes on. Who's no denying that. He's just looking at me like, wow, I go, you tripped balls.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       But I was worried. I was like, I can't kill my friend. I was literally word for a few minutes. I was like, what of his body just can't handle it. Like, because Doug is world famous for abusing himself, cigarettes and booze and it's just fucking, he's got hernias. You could stick out. He can flex his stomach and things that pop out of his gun. I'm not bullshitting. He's hilarious. But you know, he's a maniac. He's just, there's not a game man. He's not playing an act as doug that he is who he is. And I was thinking maybe this is like slapping a corvette engine into a 1969 dodge dart that's got 299,000 miles and just share wheels on the back, bad breaks. And it just seemed like, well, what have I done? I shot up to it because when I did it, it felt like I got shot through a cannon.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       It was like, like the, the experience of the launch, like it came on slow, like it came on, like it took a few seconds and then once it hit itches it's almost like you're pulling back against a catapult band or a rubber band or slingshot and just. And then it was just flying to know me. So like where I flew to, there was no me, there was no difference between me and the air that's in front of me and the, the wood that makes this table and the floor beneath and all the different molecules and atoms I could broke down the existence of everything to some strange geometric level and it was really intense and totally colorless. It's like a big white thing, like it would bring you to this weird geometric white thing.

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       Whereas DMT is come n n dimethyltryptamine is five, methoxy dimethyltryptamine is five meo and it's just a different visual experience than n n dimethyltryptamine, which was the one that brings you these intense visions of geometric patterns and dancing. Like the last time I did it it was they were dancing jokers that were giving me the finger. They just kept giving me the finger and I was like, Oh yeah, I deserve that. Like I felt it, like as they were doing it, they're like, fuck you, fuck you. And I was realizing like, oh, someone needs to say that to me. Like, oh, I'm being silly person. Like by even trying to control this trip, like by even like thinking that like I'm just going to go into this. I've been doing, I'm been a good boy, but doing my yoga and eating healthy and this should be a good good trip.

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       Fuck you. It was like, fuck you. You've got no control out of this. You better relaxed, which makes it a heroic dose. You gotta let go. Well, all DMT is a heroic dose. Once you passed that three hit threshold, right? Good bye. You're gone. There's no, there's no, no, you're gone. You're gone or you're gone. They're just gone. Yeah. That heroic dose I took, I ended up. I mean the story was a lot of weird shit how he never got done explaining how much did it actually take four hits. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, because I gave this old psychiatrist three hits and I saw him a couple of weeks later and he was like, oh, that was good clean stuff. No problem. It was, and I thought, well if that guy he's in his sixties could take three. I'll take four. I met this dude in Montana recently, very nice guy named Jeff and he was working with us on this mediator show and he's told us that he took 25 hits of acid one night.

Speaker 3:          01:00:55       See I, I went back in the day. I did five or six or whatever, but I felt like there was a plateau, like I couldn't trip any harder than I tripped. So I, I don't know that 20 would be. Yeah, he just went with it. He said, I forget how he described it, but just went with it. I just, last night I watched this documentary called the sunshine makers, about the guys Owsley and, and the two guys who were making orange sunshine together, the famous acid of the sixties. Oh yeah. And one of the guys was like, that's all. Send those. Right. That's all Sandoz lamps. No, that was the legal shit. And so this is the guys in California and Colorado briefly who were making the illegal stuff. Um, and who, who was in the sunshine, I forget. There's two guys. The one guy was a ghost champions. Got. It. Was a documentary. Nicholas Tim scully, unlikely duo at the heart of the 19 sixties American drug countercultural. Yeah, it's quite good. It's so weird that that was so incredibly recent, but within a few decades they had basically erased all evidence of it from culture except for a few fringe people, you know? Yeah. I mean, talking about old research, there were thousands, tens of thousands of scientific papers published on how hallucinogens affect the brain. In fact, the Sarah Turner Jack System, the whole understanding of neurotransmitters really

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       was fueled by trying to understand how so little lsd could make you so high. That's what, that's what got people into looking at neurotransmitters in the effects on consciousness in the late fifties anyway. I mean, we could talk for ever about how a hallucinogens have changed culture. But uh, what the hell was I saying? Oh, so you took forehead and the movie this guy says, yeah, but the movie this guy says, um, you know, he's talking about how they're doing the vats and he's a chemist. He's like, every once in a while you know, you touch something and it's hot and you go, Oh, and you put your thumb in your mouth. And I'm like, oh, I just took 200 micrograms of LSD. They go, well, they were high all the time while they were working. Yeah. And that's actually 22,000 La isn't there like a number?

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       Like someone told me, this is maybe one of those urban myths, like you have to register your hands as lethal weapons once you get your black belt. That was an urban with too, but isn't there an urban myth that like if you do a certain amount of acid, you're considered legally insane? I heard that. I don't know. I don't know if that's true. I hope it is because then I'm like free and clear. Let me see. Jamie's at real. That's what I've heard that my whole life as well. Do you remember hearing that? It's bullshit. I was like seven hits and make you insane. You're gone bro. Legally. So anything you do afterwards, if you can prove you tripped at least whatever, seven times. People that have done big doses of acid and some of them have had a really hard time grasping regular reality and I wonder if there's a correlation.

Speaker 4:          01:03:48       I wonder if there's a connection between like some of them have like really distorted perceptions of what's going on right now in terms of like, like an experience will happen and they'll have a version of the experience and you'll relay your version of that experience and they didn't. They didn't remember that at all and you're like, man, I don't know who's got this right, because memory is kind of a slippery thing, but I don't remember him saying that to you, man. I don't remember someone doing that to you. I don't remember that going down. Like people have these weird perceived interactions that maybe are a little skewed and I always wonder like, is it the 39 hits of acid you took one night? Is it, I mean, did you blow a fuse? Can you blow a few of these in it? Like you know, somebody who works out and they mess up their back and you say, well you can blame it on working out or you could blame it on and working out wrong or you could blame it on the fact that you probably already had a structural issue in your back that this just uncovered.

Speaker 4:          01:04:37       So I think a lot of people who have bad experiences or end up fucked up from hallucinogens, they're going to be fucked up anyway. And there are psychotic breaks. You know, like this kid that I talked about earlier, Nance Amsterdam, he had a psychotic break, but generally you can recover from that and you'll be fine unless there's some underlying structural issue in your personality. You know, so I don't know. I think it's multifactorial like everything. And so ultimately I think you're totally right. That completely makes sense and it's one of the things that you've got to think about when you talk about food or alcohol or anything that people want up getting addicted to, right? People

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       can blow their brains out on a variety of different substances that are readily available. We're always looking for the reason for the effect, but normally it's a million reasons for an effect, but it's no constellation if your son goes crazy from taking acid, you know, it's one of those things if acid became legal and your son walked into a cvs and bought acid and did too much with his friends and never came back and you had to take care of him when he's 50. No, it's no constellation. But you know, a lot of people have psychotic breaks when their girlfriend breaks up with them the first time. It's true. So are we going to blame women for psychosis? You know, it's hard to describe or to really recognize like what is a psychotic break, what is real mental illness and when are you just being a bitch?

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       Well, a professional should be able to recognize. I would hope so. At least when you're just being near an edge, during an edge to like mental illness and just being a bench like we're talking about. Psychosis. Neurosis. One more time, dude, don't call her. I've got to call her. No you don't. You don't have to call it. The universe was telling me to call her. I have to talk to her right now. She'll understand what's her talked to her. There is a restraining order. Stop. Do you want to go to jail? I'm just going to knock on our window. Don't do it. There's people that get obsessed with people when it comes to relationships and you just go, what will people get addicted to each other? They get as addicted to each other as they get addicted to sugar easily. It's harder for people to break up with people than it is from the kick.

Speaker 3:          01:06:46       Sugar people can kick sugar. They decide they want to lose weight. A lot of people do it, but when people break up like the emotional toll that you take, it's so devastating and I think part of the reason why the emotional toll so devastating and less being with the person was completely negative. It was completely negative. Then you're like, finally, I'm fucking free. I've met a few of those in my life and I'm sure you have to, but there's other ones. We like, God, this feels terrible, and it's like it's stuck a emotional flu. No, it doesn't want to go away, and I think it's because we get addicted to each other in the same way that we bonded to create these communal tribes have 50 people back in the day. Those instincts still remain and I think one of the reward systems, and you would know better than I have connecting everybody together with this is got to be this deep affection and this addiction that we developed towards each other.

Speaker 3:          01:07:41       Yeah, well, we, we need to be loved. We need to be touched. And a lot of times if you don't have a partner, nobody's touching, you know, as an adult. And uh, yeah, I mean I love is a funny thing. I talk about this a lot on the podcast, you know, I guess I'm. People think I'm some sort of relationship expert, which is hilarious. Um, but, uh, I, I told this, I don't know if I've told this story in your podcast, but my dad has this golden retriever and he's had like five of them. They all look the same. I don't know this one, just the last one thing, brandy. Okay. So the fourth of July

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       they had the dog out in the backyard and they went to watch some fourth of July things, some party somewhere. And apparently the fireworks scared the dog and the dog jumped a fence and took off. Oh No, and so my dad and my sister were all freaked out and they're putting up store signs all over the neighborhood and Colin and the shelters and all that day or two later, they get a call from shelter. Hey, we've got your dog come down and like, oh, there she is, so take the dog home. They're in the backyard throwing the ball with the dog, and my sister's boyfriend comes home and he looks out the window and he says to my mom, who's dog are they play in with? She said, well, that's brandy. And he said, that's not brandy. And then a few minutes later the phone rings. It's a neighbor. Hey, we've got brandy. Oh Jesus, it's the wrong dog. Right? So what do they do? They took it back to the found should killed it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:05       Your imposter. You try to pretend you're not branding, respond to brandy fraud, but my point, yeah, no, the dog was like, what did I do wrong? I chased your ball. You know, I mean, they were. They sound like a great dog owner. They should have just kept that. She brought it back. They found of exactly where you adopt a kid and again, I'm going to send you back. Yeah. If somebody comes looking for that dog, then call me until then. The dog lives here. Should have been. You can't bring it back. The power. What a fucking drag for the dog. I know, but my point is there in the backyard with the dog. What are they feeling? My Dad's feeling incredible relief. Brandi's back love. He loves brandy, brandy, but it doesn't matter because he's still feeling love and I think we do that in our relationships.

Speaker 4:          01:09:58       We project our need to love on whoever the fuck will take it. I mean, what's that Beatle Song? I need somebody to love and then in the back you ever listed in the back, they see can it be anybody? And then he says, I just want someone to love. I don't give a fuck who it is. I just want a dog. I don't care. I want a girlfriend. Take whatever. What do you do? That's a thing with a lot of people that don't have relationships. They have a bunch of pets. Yeah, they need someone or something. I love anytime. You know, if you're a single person, you come home, your dogs are so happy to see you really couldn't your kisses in get your pets in. Yeah, I mean dogs are like emotional bandaids for a lot of people. Even cats, you have cats. I love cats and they don't give a fuck. Don't give a fuck. Are you there or not? But they'll sit on your lap and purr when you pet them. Yeah, they'll accept your love, which is nice. Sometimes that's enough dogs better obviously, you know, I can't believe you can get new cats.

Speaker 4:          01:10:59       Fucking shows sucks, right? I forget where they are. The millions of listening and it's just such a hackneyed debate. Dogs versus cats. I'm really into fucking aardvarks bro. Pet aardvark. Yeah. I watched a video

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       online of a wild pig that had eaten through a cow's body and got stuck in the farmer, found the cow and this wild pig is like coming out through a hole in its stomach, like he'd eaten through the cow and got stuck. It's like Jim Carrey and pet detective when he comes out of the Zebra. Is this it? Yeah, there it is. You watch a lot of gross shit, but this is not that gross. See, look at it. It's stuck. I can't get out of the body, the skin, the skin of the cow at eight through it, but then it can't get fat body through and got his head through, but he can't fit the rest of it through. How could it not back out. Doesn't know what to do with stupid fucking wild pig. I have a friend who has a pig. A pet pig.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       A potbelly pig. Yeah, exactly it. Apparently he passed. It's like really smart. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bummer if there's a little bacon's a bummer. If you think about what is it is. I keep trying to find cruelty free bacon and it's just not. They're not real. I can't find you got to shoot a pig. Get Bacon. Just a certain amount of cruelty involved in that delicious Taylor here. A pig or see a pink dye. I've killed pigs. Cope. They don't die. Happy. Well, I. The one I killed died real quick, shot it with a 300 win mag and died instantly in the head, in the body body cavity like blue. It's hard out, but he died instantaneously. Turned around. I drove a 300 the scope into my forehead. That was nice. Got a lot of kick. It's a good round because anything it hits dies very humanely, very quickly if you hit it right, obviously.

Speaker 1:          01:12:50       Yeah, but I'm wild. Pigs are a huge problem and I know that pig people have a problem with people eating animals and I get that, but there's always going to be an issue. Even if we didn't need any animals. If you don't want all of your vegetables eaten up by wild pigs, somebody has to control the population because there's no way to control them. They breed at a staggering rate. They breed three or four. I mean they'll have these letters. They can have literally two, three times a year. They started having litters when they're six months old, when they're six months old, they start shitting out pigs and there's a ton of them. I mean, there's around Sonoma county. I've been in San Jose, they're eating people's lawns and residential neighborhoods. They're not to be fucked with you. Don't get outta here. Pig. They'll kill your dog to the fuck your dog up and slice them up and they'll eat them too.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       Once he's dead. Their tusks, like especially the big boars, they're enormous animals too. You're talking about like some of them were. They shot one at that to hone. Ranch thing was about 350 pounds last week. Three hundred 50 pounds for. This is a wild snorting, horrific beast. It's not a fat pig wallowing around there. Fast and aggressive. They're fast, aggressive and ferocious. They have a what's called a a shield plate all around their front body, like where their face is like from their jaw line back. They have this incredibly thick like leather and it's to protect them from going to war with other male bores in those giant tusks, so they fucking slice each other up and so these things are just their tanks. They're super durable tanks who are born at a ridiculous rate if there's millions of them roaming through the country. And there was an article that I posted on twitter just a few days ago where, uh, the scientists were saying it's just a matter of time before every county in every state has a wild pig problem. It's just there. They're not stopping the breeding and not stopping the growth and they're just going to slowly spread out like coyote roadies

Speaker 3:          01:14:51       and the meat's good, right? Oh, it's really good. It's delicious. The perfect situation because you're, you're killing something that needs to be killed, you know, it used to be cougars were killing them and you know, whatever other predators we're keeping them in check. There's no not, they're an invasive species. They weren't native to North America. Now they're brought over here from Russia. They were brought over here from Asia. They brought over here from different parts of the world are some ferocious Russian ones that are in the northern California coast that are connected to, I think it was William Randolph hearst, the hearst castle up there. I think William Randolph hearst had bores up there. It's one more thing they came from, there were predators, you know, well, the Siberia, they, you know, they probably lived in incredibly harsh environments and it's one of the reasons why they thrive here.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       Yeah. And my point is there's no Predator now they're living free. They're not, they're not like pigs that are turned into bacon or fucking cages where they can turn around and all that shit. See, that's the thing that gets me. I mean, I have no problem eating meat because as Doug Stanhope said, life becomes life. You know, life eats life. That's what it does. There's no getting around that. There's a book called the Vegetarian Myth. You ever read that? Um, yes. It was a woman who was a Vegan for 20 years and then she's like, I'm going to grow my own food. And as soon as she started growing her own food, she realized there's no way to even grow food without killing stuff. You got to put this stuff down to protect the garden from the slugs and kills the slugs. The fertilizer is made out of bone and blood meal.

Speaker 3:          01:16:19       Where's that come from? Right. It's like there's no way to not kill things in order to eat. Even if you're eating vegetables, you still killing things to eat them. Well, that's the connection to the actual food itself. Rate right from the source and it gives you this understanding of it, but still you can, you can mitigate the amount of suffering that you've asked. What I was going to say. Yeah. I've got no problem eating something that lived a life, a free life. Like these wild boars. Yeah. What I have a problem with is the industrial process, you know, wild boar is, might be one of the few things that we, um, we almost have enough where everybody can hunt them because I mean there's not enough deer. There's not enough elk for people to, to hunt in this country. Like if everybody wanted to do what some people are trying to do with it, just trying to get all the meat from the wild does it just not enough wild but there enough for the amount of people that are doing it for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:17:11       Definitely it's a very sustainable, but that's also why it's really difficult to get certain tags for certain animals in certain areas where they do monitor the population and they say, well we have like a certain amount here, this is a, this is the amount that we have and this is the amount that we think would be healthy to removed from the population because of the competition for food and this and that and, and you know, so these people compete for not to compete, but they put it in there for like the apply for a tag, like a lottery system. It might be a thousand people apply, but only 100 get tags and now those 100, most of the time it's not even 50 percent success rate. So these are the proposition of going out and just trying to get your own meats. Very sketchy. It's very hard to do.

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       Not everybody could do it. So it's not, it's not really a viable alternative to feeding 350 million people. No, but it could be viable for you. And I feel like that's the thing about people when it comes to impact. We always, we have this weird thing, we're go, well, everybody can't do that. You're right. Everybody can do that. Everybody can't live in your house either, right? Everybody doesn't want to do that. Everybody can't sleep in your bed. Every. Everybody can't fuck your wife unless you guys would like that, unless your brakes, you know, it's like there's a certain amount of shit you can think of for your own life, like for your own life. You want to feel better? Go shoot a wild pig. That's where you get your food. You'll feel better. You'll feel weird. You. Michael Pollan wrote a very interesting essay about him shooting a wild pig up in sonoma.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       It's, I think it's included in the Omnivore's dilemma, his big best seller where he wanted to trace the origins of everything, every element of a meal. And so he built a book around that. But he, I remember reading that essay in the New Yorker, I think. And um, I was struck by how he, he conveys really powerfully the feeling of having killed something where there was this sort of jubilation followed by shame, followed by like a confusion and discussed and like all these things were sort of waves passing through him. You know, he wasn't a big hunter. He just wanted to have this one experience. Right. And uh, yeah, it's my buddy, Justin's gonna take me hunting. He's been offering for a couple of years now and I want to do it. I'm not a big killer, but I know how to shoot guns and I feel some responsibility to face the reality of meat, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:19:34       I mean just face it, you're killing shit, you know, and just because someone's doing it for you in a factory and cutting it up and putting it in plastic, that doesn't mean you're not involved in that process. Would you be one of the people that would adopt lab created meat? Would you put that in your diet once that, that actually happens because they're pretty sure that they're going to be able to make that happen soon? Or would you look at it and say, well, I mean, how would you look at it? I'd want to look at it scientifically and no, you know, what's the nutritional content? Because I'm very suspicious of these things that come out of laboratory.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       Yeah. But if it turned out that it was, it tasted the same, the nutritional content was as good as wild, you know, meet with grass Fed Omega three and all that kind of stuff. They Omega three, Omega six ratios were right? Yeah, I'd eat it. Why not? I eat a lot of weird shit and we all do. Or most of us, you know, I would definitely try it. My mother had a bowl of cheese puffs the other day at the superbowl. What the fuck is a cheese puff? Asshole fire talk. Something that comes out of a lab or marshmallows when they have banned trans fats in the United States, but they allow people to put them in for the next couple of years in 2018 runs out. So until then you could poison people. Until then you can keep throwing that stuff and whatever the fuck baked goods and Taito creations. What did we find out the Trans fats are in?

Speaker 4:          01:21:03       It was in like microwave popcorn I think was one. That's crazy. That stuff's God damn delicious. Yeah, I'd love microwave popcorn and what do you need to make popcorn? It's not. I mean just make it normally a little oil. I know, but it's so convenient. If you're a lazy fuck, it's the stockpiles you can do, you know, the whole sort of fertilizer and I'm not fertilizer pesticide, insecticide and you know, farm spraying crops and all that shit. That all started because at the end of World War II there were huge stockpiles of chemical weapons that weren't used. And so they're like, what are we going to do with this shit? We gotta sell this shit. And they were like, well we can dilute it and spray it and it'll kill aphids or whatever the fuck. And there really wasn't a big problem with pests in the American farming industry, but they had all the stock pile of stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:21:53       And the Rachel Carson writes about this in silent spring. A classic book. Yeah. Crazy. So it's like there's bacon and eggs. We think that's a natural breakfast thing that was invented by an advertising agency. Yeah. We talked about this before. Anyway. Yeah. We talked about this and we've talked about how Kellogg's created really blend cereal to keep people from beating off. See, that's my shtick. Right. That's a beautiful stick though. Once people find out that's true. You're like, what? Just think of how bizarre Graham crackers Graham crackers again. Again, it was current. Graham and Kellogg were the two sort of anti masturbation guy and he thought Graham crackers keep you from being off because they're so blend. That's hilarious. Isn't it hilarious that they associated spicy food, like Latino's dance? They had tacos. We had to tell about the Taco. Yeah, some fucking hot salsa. Salsa music. Getting crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:22:48       You always associate salsa music with a woman with like a dress. It's like slit up the side. Um, and the way up to her hip. See, I wish if I were efficient like you, I would have learned to salsa dance years ago. I'm not that efficient. I don't see. I can't even ice skate in your head. There's salsa dancing and then right next to it on the shelf is ice skating seems to be something that a lot of people know how to do. Not a lot of Mexicans. That's true of African ice skaters. Right. That's what black people have, haven't dominated hockey otherwise. Able to take it over. That shit too. I'm coming because ice skating like a fucking never learned. Yeah. I can ice skate, you know, I feel good now. My kids can but can. But like to me the sexiest women or the women who were salsa dancing, you know, like sweaty, you know, move the way they move and it's all like, well it's a party and I just love to be out there on the floor.

Speaker 4:          01:23:43       Mr Coolguy a light colored suit, you know? Yeah. Like Miami Vice. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm picturing. But first no socks you doing in my dreams. That's me problem with loafers. No socks. They could really stink after a while. Right. You can get your fetal sweat and air and it's disgusting and it's not as much. Yeah, it's gross. Yeah. I don't know. I'm lucky in that respect or I'm just totally diluted, but I think I. I think my body does instinct much, but I may be wrong about that. I may just have really friendly people around. Well, you know how olfactory senses work, right? They work on change. They don't work on. You don't recognize like distinct smells that last, like a say if you're living in an area that stinks. You know how people used to. The smell of baby shit. Yeah. Oh No. Not necessarily because baby shit's not in front of you all the time, but things that are around you all the time, like your own funk or how your house smells, your.

Speaker 4:          01:24:42       You become immune to it. Unless there's like, like if you have a house, like if you're at a cat pissing your house, fucking my friend in bed. Do you like walking around? Like where the fuck is it? Now I'm walking around like a God damn dog trying to find out where my cat pissed, especially when I used to have a carpet grows because you never knew where they pissed and then you never really totally got it out of there and then they know you never got it out of there. So they find that spot piano and again, wretched a cat in college. I'd moved into this shared apartment with this woman and uh, she had this cat named Michael who was beautiful cat, big, big sort of whiskers and just a lovely, beautiful of communism. I don't know, I think it was more like a thing, but the cat would like get on a table and he put his paws on your shoulders and just rub his face and your face and you'd be like, oh, what a great cat.

Speaker 4:          01:25:35       And then he would just freak out and like fucking face and scratchy and run away. Like, oh, this cat fucked right. Probably got acid. Somebody fucking massive. I think. Yeah, because it was one of these hippie houses where people are moving through all the time, fucking hippies. Anyway, so I ended up hooking up with this woman and I remember one time we were in my bed and we're having sex and the cat walks in and he looks at me and he backs up to my bookshelf and just show my love for my well holding eye contact with me. Oh, that's disturbing. Uh, I think he had a thing with this woman and I was. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Just getting with her because he's probably, if he's spraying, it's probably not fixed. Right. It wasn't fixed. You cannot. First of all, you got to fix those cats because when they walk in on you fucking they're going to get horny if freaks.

Speaker 4:          01:26:28       Yeah. Especially male cats that don't, they don't get fixed. They all spray. All of them mean female cats. They get into heat and they start mowing, sticking their ass up in the air. Yeah. I told the story about my sexual experience to see the animation. That guy did it that. No, I didn't. Who did it? Which guy? Name? But it's, it's on youtube and it is. So polly polly, it's an animator in in Peru and he wrote to me, he's, he's not Peruvian but he's based there, but he wrote to me and he's like, hey man, would you mind if I did an animation of some store, a story you tell in your podcast? I was like, yeah, go ahead. That's great. You don't need my permission. Right. But he picked the one of me and you and Duncan and I'm telling the story about this cat and the pencil and the cats up in the pencil and all this shit.

Speaker 4:          01:27:18       It's like, dude, you pick the one story like I don't really want the world. Like the Joe Rogan audience will get it. My audience will get it, but I don't know that like twitter universe is gonna get it. So I feel bad because he put a lot of work into it, but I haven't really pushed to promote it much. But it's really what you're saying. But I think your, your fears are unfounded to think. So that's the fuck the people don't have you come across. You're hilarious. And the Jamie, if you could find this thing. It's called A. It's on my youtube channel. I remember the story. It's something about if you just Google Christopher Ryan fucks a cab with a pencil or does it? I'd love to see what else. We had a catalyst and he, before she got fixed, we've got to fix like right when she got into heat.

Speaker 4:          01:28:03       But when you had pet her and she was like, lift her ass up in the air. Just like as soon as you give her any affection and then it'll be spanker they love to get spanked to Jesus Christ. Yeah. I had a cat who would hold onto the sofa and I'd spank or God. And then I'd like fake spanker and she'd fall off because she was already compensating for it. God. So you were like beating her off by spanking or you know, I basically write, I like to give animals pleasure. And normally the way that expresses itself, like in Spain, in our apartment in span, I built this whole cat world like I built. I got this big piece of driftwood and I wrapped. I'm climbing rope around it so they can climb straight up this thing and then there's a series of shelves along the ceiling so they jump around and they can go all around the room and chase each other and hang out up there.

Speaker 4:          01:28:52       When you're having a party, they're like up there just hanging out watching people and because they're, you know, that's where they want to be. Right. And then on the terrorist I built this big tree thing, they go on and there's a hammock in it and the cats get in the hammock and swimming. And so I love seeing the animals happy, you know? I mean maybe in a way my whole, my, the things I write are trying to make people happy because what I'm trying to do is get people in their natural environment. That's what I'm trying. This one I'm writing about, you know. And so with cats it's the same way I want them to be. I want them to. I want to create a jungle for them and a world. And it's so cool because we had three cats and they, once you build this world for them, they leave you alone. They're not like. People think cats are like, ah, you know, it's all pathetic. It's, you know, I come home and we ain't me man. If you have three cats, they have their own life and they're happy to interact with you when you went to. But when you don't want to, they're doing their thing, you know? It was really. It's really good. Alright. Jamie arthritis there. Interesting little animals, man. I love the relationships that people have with their cats. It's very. Okay. Here we go. What is that?

Speaker 4:          01:30:01       Well, don't, don't watch the whole thing. This one's got like a laugh track on it. Oh No, no, no. The laugh track. He added that. That's because I was talking about doing this Gig in Hollywood. Oh, okay. It's called a nine and a half lives with Dr Christopher Ryan. Why is it not? But you should see the image of you though. You're sitting just like this. There you go. Let's hear some of it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:28       I'm eight years old. It's the seventies and a bridge party at their friend's place in it. So there's no babysitter. They take a station wagon and love American style, the Brady bunch those days, if anyone's old enough to remember that shit. Anyway. So I'm like, Hey, they put me in the basement in the family room and they say keep the door closed because the cats in heat, right. That means, I think it means the cat part. So they've got the AC on, keep the door closed. I don't know. So I go down and watching TV and this is just like all over the place, rubbing her ass on my leg and just like looking at me and she's like, really? Because somebody scratched my itch, you know? And I looked down and there's this pencil on the table next to the sofa. Oh No, you did take the pencil and with the eraser down, I just hold it there. Right. And this cat backs up on this. So it starts fucking humping. Reached me out the inside of her. Apart with the metal casing. No, no, but you know what? Male cat penises have spine that come out on when the withdrawal that does rip up the inside of the female blood has to mix with catsimatidis fertilized staff.

Speaker 2:          01:31:45       What happened was the pencil away because it was freaking me out and then turns around and looks at me like, Yo, what? Hey, what are you doing that got to come on. And like, like really like shocked and disappointed.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       I was like Whoa. So I put it back down again and the cab backs up when it starts fucking this pencil again and this time I hold on and then she comes and she's a forecast and she like rolls over and looks at me looking at her face and it looks at me with love and gratitude. First sexual experience I ever had. You didn't put your penis against the cab was eight years old? I wasn't. I was experiencing it as an idea. I wasn't feeling it as a sexual thing. You? Yeah. Yeah. When you were a kid, but I could see that. Oh I fucked every cat in the neighborhood. Did you?

Speaker 3:          01:32:39       Is that good to Dave Anderson? Blood sausage.co dot UK. What? Uh, he's great animations, amazing. Perfect. I mean, I've probably seen it 20 times and every time I see details, if you freeze that frame of the Brady Bunch or love American style or whatever it was like every one of those characters. And I'd love to know how accurate his tattoo is of your arm. And do you have a tee shirt that says how dare you? No, I don't. It's just a phrase he used to say it all the time. I don't think the tattoos were accurate. I didn't recognize him, but whatever. It was amazing. The Duncan thing with little pyramid with the floating high above it, sitting in front of them all the time and he's wearing a syrupy guys. Great. Yeah. What is definitely not correct. But um, the uh, the other thing was the car, how the car was bouncing up and down as he was driving and it's got the wood siding, you know, it's like he, he got the seventies, everyone's wearing leisure suits and smoking cigarettes.

Speaker 3:          01:33:44       A shit is really well done. Not Matter. What the fuck was that? Oh, we're talking about giving cats. Pleasure making animals. Had a buddy of mine who used to jerk off as rottweiler with his foot. He used to put his foot on his was dick and he would like rub it back and forth and rottweiler would come. And uh, I told my girlfriend at the time, it's a long time ago and she was so mad. She was so disgusted like that. It's fucking disgusting. And I'm just like, why is it disgusting? The guys just beaten off his dog, like, the dog can't do it. The dog could do it. He would do it himself. So he's like a friend talking like his own balls pretty easily. Uh, yeah, that's true. But I don't think that's enough. I think you needed more. So my friend needs to beat them off with his foot.

Speaker 3:          01:34:28       His dog. I think there's like a female sex toy. You can get the dogs. Oh yeah. There's like a thing that, that makes sense. Like a fleshlight for dogs. That makes sense. Keep them from helping your leg. Yeah. Why not? I mean, you want them to be happy. There was this controversy, uh, not too long ago, a woman wrote a book about John Lilly, Jamie, just, yeah, I know what you're talking about. And you look at this, there is a doll to sex doll doll for dogs and it's shaped like a dog and you just got to get your horny dog and just back them up onto that bitch. Wow. That's hilarious. Will push them forward onto that bitch. Say back the bitch up onto him. Well, why don't they just make like a one of them real dolls for a dog? Give it hair. Like the American Werewolf in London out there. Something like that with a dog. Doesn't feel dirty. Like he's got a flux of machine because they didn't put any, any work whatsoever in the aesthetics. Do you think the dogs care? They might. It might feel better for them. They might get a little more excited if fluidly. A real dawn. You could give it like a soundtrack. A little while. Just looking over shoulder please. Please don't.

Speaker 3:          01:35:44       Uh, yeah. With the woman who jerked off the Dolphin. Yes. Well, what's fascinating about that story is this woman was living with a young adolescent male dolphin in this adolescent male. Dolphin would. They were trying to get the dolphin to talk in a flooded house, flooded house. So she lived in a place where she would like have waist high water everywhere she went, so the dolphin could swim freely through the house and live with her. But the dolphin was horny all the time. So he didn't want to do studies. So what she did was she beat him off and when word got out that she beat off the dolphin, they canceled all the research is now how I thought it. The research. Well, they got in trouble, the gunter, but recently because she talked about it recently when she wrote a book about the time I was working with John Lilly who run to invent this sensory deprivation tank.

Speaker 3:          01:36:32       Well, no, he, I think he had already been invented it at the time. He was on like one of the first iterations of it and he was also giving assets dolphins. So it might've been. That was one of those things that led to them pulling the plug on. The research is either she was jerking it off and they found out that they were also. I think the Defense Department was using his research to train dolphins to kill in Vietnam and to plant bombs, suicide bombs and suicide bombers. They would try. They were training them to suicide bomb, which is crazy. It's crazy that they. They felt like that was. Well I guess. Look man, when you were in war, you were already deciding that you're killing people, so the, the idea of killing dolphins to kill people. It's like they didn't think of dolphins the way we think of dolphins today, either like that.

Speaker 3:          01:37:19       That might be something that the military would still be interested in doing. I don't know. I mean maybe they aren't doing it. They're just not telling us about it. A lot of whales with all their sonar testing. Yeah, because they do these intense sound waves in the underwater and the whales have very sensitive sound reception. Oh, organize. So at fucking blast them and because it gives them like tinnitus or some shit, like a rock band. The lead singer of Ac dc can't do shows anymore. Pete Townsend really can't hear anything. Pete Townsend's almost deaf too. In depth for. Yeah, the lead singer of AC DC. His ears are so fucked up. He can't tour anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:37:57       Yeah. I can't go to concerts, man. Like I. I've been to a few concerts recently. I mean I never. It's not a question of being old. I hear that getting older noise bothers you more. But I've always been annoyed by noise and especially where they're playing shit so loud that it's distorting the speakers. It's like year. That's not. That doesn't sound good by being louder is better, but I don't know. That's a weird. Yeah. But there's a thing that people like to do. They like to know that they're really fucking party and man that's it. Turn it up to 11 and I think those are the people that need to go to the fucking gym. Heavy bag. That's it. See, this is it. This keys back into me being a lazy Hippie, like moderate sound, but I don't need it to all the way out.

Speaker 4:          01:38:48       Get something to beat up. You fucks. Yeah. And stopped it out. So you never been to the Salton sea? No, I have not. But I saw that you were there recently. I was a photo. Yeah. It should come out there. I want to. It's an intense post apocalyptic scene out to just see the joy. It was John Waters to the documentary on, I believe. No, no, no. There was a scene in, into the wild where he, the kid is there. Do you remember that? He's hanging out with some hippies and like a desert that was in the salt and sea. Yeah. He was in slab city, which is in the solvency. Oh yeah. I've got my buddy towel as a this year. Is the second a Bombay beach being alley. He's doing. Oh, look at that. That guy. Salvation Mountain. That's that guy that has been making this mountain.

Speaker 4:          01:39:38       Yeah. Out of a art and painting it for years. It's all about Jesus and love. And He, uh, he makes his paint and Straw and mud and uh, he built this whole thing. Yeah. It's crazy structure has been working on for decades, right. He died a couple of years ago. Oh, thought is that Kristen Stewart? Oh yeah, yeah. Her Dad used to be the, uh, one of the, the producer guys on fear factor. He was like, I don't know what his official title was, but he was like the guy who got everything together, like got everybody in place and made sure everything was running. It was like big job. Yeah. He was like the guy on the street, like while everything was going on, really good dude. Fun Guy. Crazy man. And that's, uh, that's his daughter. And I was always like, dude, you shouldn't have your kid act. She's so young. It seems crazy. So we'll never make it. While she was a twilight girl, seemed like one of the most famous actresses, but I never saw her until Saturday night live a couple of days ago. Oh really? Yeah. So on, like we should do it. She hosted. Oh no kidding. This last. Yeah. Just got some new movie coming out or something. I don't know what she was doing. Know what she was promoting.

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       If anything, I didn't catch it. I just watched it because the scene with Kathy Bates Doing Sean Spicer. Did you see that? No, but I heard it was awesome. I haven't seen this. Meghan McCarthy. Macarthur. Thank you. I keep saying Kathy Bates, it's thing. It's negative mccarthy. It's Melissa Mccarthy Directing your current. Jamie. I think that that's show Saturday night live is all the evidence we need. The Donald Trump needs to do mushrooms because he keeps tweeting about Alec Baldwin doing that sketch about them saying it's not funny to. Why are we laughing? Tell me what's going on. Why are we laughing? Like if someone shitting on you. Look, it doesn't feel good. I know. It doesn't feel good, but it is funny. Yeah. You know, and Alec Baldwin does do a fucking amazing impressionable. It's his best work, right? It's right up there with that whole fucking closers. Get coffee. Oh, a Glengarry Glen Ross.

Speaker 3:          01:41:45       Glen Ross. Yeah. Been that rant that he did in that movie. That's insane. Fucking epic, right? Yeah, I think there's trump impressions right up there. Yeah, it's really good. It's really good and it's getting better. The more he does, he looks more and more like him, you know, what does it say? They're bad news for trump side. I live in the midst of a ratings renaissance. Of course it is, and that's one of the reasons why, you know, the center live is like a show that goes in cycles, you know, you have these cycles of greatness and then like to try to find themselves, believe new people struggle a little bit. There's always something good there, but it's almost like a, it's really, it's got to be insanely difficult to create a new show every week. Insane. You know, dog eat dog environment and even like you look, if you go back and look at videos from the glory days, you know, that Dan Akroyd days and John Belushi and all that, there was still a lot of filler in there.

Speaker 3:          01:42:40       Oh, for sure. You know, we remember the automatic and you know, the good, the great moments. A Samurai John Belushi, Sandra character. Exactly. You couldn't do that anymore. It'd be cultural appropriation that you couldn't do. You probably couldn't do the. Were too wild and crazy guys. I don't know. I mean they were right. They were white, but there were definitely foreign because you do more at. Could you do bar out today? I don't know. I mean it was just a few years ago, but it might be different if he tried it today. Incredibly racist and he's like, oh, he's like an Orthodox Jew. That guy, the comedian who does Bora. Is He really? Yeah. He's like a seriously religious, you know, honors this Shabat and all that kind of stuff. Serious Jewish practicing Jew. I forgot his real name is Ali g to me, Ali. Jesus' best work when he would interview people and they didn't know who his leg. He can't do that anymore. But when he interviewed me, he interviewed a Buzz Aldrin, explained humor to him. That was one of the greatest. He's explaining humor while he's in the midst of a joke that he doesn't know is

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       for buzz or owned. Yeah. But you know who my favorite, uh, one of the few where he wasn't getting on with Ralph Nader, Ralph Nader just kind of went with him. Well, what happened was, so allie is doing this whole thing where they're talking about the environment and global warming and he says, well, but you know, isn't a major cause of global warming, the cow farts. And so shouldn't we just, you know, put balloons on cows and you know, he gets into this whole thing, right? And Ralph Nader is looking at them and you can see when the balloons on the cows asses thing comes out. Ralph Nader's like I go, wait a minute. And so he just sort of, when he finished his talk and he says, well, you know, scientists have been working on that, but it's very hard to develop a valve that perfectly fits a cow's ass hole.

Speaker 4:          01:44:41       And then it cuts, cuts. And then the next scene, like after commercial, whatever, you see algae and Ralph Nader wrapping together. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. Is a really. Do one of those with trump. But trump walked out on us. Play this very quick, get in trouble, but are we gonna get in trouble right now. Hold on. What are we doing? Hold on. It's going to do something. Why are we getting in trouble? Well, we get our shit pulled from youtube all the time. If it has content in from someone else's video. Oh really? Yeah. You can't even play the audio. So what is the problem with ice cream

Speaker 4:          01:45:33       and people listening to this audio will audio. Well, but youtube people are not. So we're, we're watching this and Donald Trump was getting upset at allergy. People are just hearing silence. Let's kill it then. This is stupid to do it this way. And yeah, it's um, whenever someone's content gets played, like anybody who owns this video, we play their video, we get pulled off of youtube and then what do you do? You have to go to cut it out, put it back up. Yeah, it's a, I get it. I get it. They want people to. But we've always tried to tell people to go to that video. That's it. You're sending traffic their way. Right? But it's funny. Go find it. Go find it in here. Yeah. That's funny. I didn't know Sacha Baron Cohen was easy. A practicing Orthodox Jew belief. So yeah. Yeah, it is. It's interesting because you think of comics is, do you know other religious comics?

Speaker 4:          01:46:24       Because there's an irreverent and intellectual irreverence. There are a few. There are a few. Um, Jim Gaffigan's Catholic. Oh yeah. That sort of his shtick. Right? I don't know if it's a shtick. I think he's actually a practicing Catholic. How much of that is legit? No, I mean that's his. He's sort of identity. I don't mean it, it's just. I just mean like he's the family man. He definitely is. Yeah. What is this? Is this him? Sacha Baron Cohen says, I wouldn't say I'm a religious man. I'm proud of my Jewish identity and there are certain things I do and customs I keep tries to keep kosher and attend synagogue about twice a year. He tries to keep kosher, but he's not saying he's really wouldn't say he's a religious Jew, but he tries to keep kosher. Alright. Yeah. It sounds like he's halfway in one foot in, one foot out.

Speaker 4:          01:47:16       I mean, you gotta think about the movies he makes. You can't, you can only be so religious and made those movies. Yeah, yeah. I Dunno. I, this whole thing about comics thinking differently. A Saturday I was at j Dot Johansen's house. He does this cajun cooking every Christmas. And uh, I was there and there was a guy, a Haney Comic Lustiness, Alan Haney, Havey Havey Havey, uh, who I recognize from mad men and, you know, and then since I met him, I've seen him everywhere. He's on that, a man in the high castle and all these shows. Anyway, so we're there and we're talking and we're talking about this thing. We're talking about the stan hope by the way. I didn't finish that cliffhanger thing, but if someone wants to listen to something, go check those two episodes out. Do you go to the names of the episode called the cliff cliff hangers?

Speaker 4:          01:48:12       Yeah. Um, but it's very intense. It's very intense. Anyway, so we're talking about this and I said, uh, have you guys seen this movie, the aristocrats? Because it's really about how comics think differently, you know, like how nothing is offensive and they're like, yeah, yeah, that's a great movie and that really gets to it and you know, whatever the conversation continues. So then I go home and a couple of days later I'm sitting there and I had a copy of the aristocrats and I haven't seen that since it came out and we're going to watch it. So I watched the aristocrats. They're both in the fucking movie and neither one of them says anything. Right? So it's again, it's this la thing where everything's the opposite of, of what I consider normal. So in la I thought about this a lot because it was so shocking to me that they were just like, oh yeah, it's a great film and then I want you to like, there they are, right?

Speaker 4:          01:49:04       How do you not say, oh, we're in that movie. How do you not say that? It can only be that in la, like name dropping is so uncool. That cool becomes what you don't say. Yeah, that definitely could be it because people see famous people all the time in la, so it's like if you're like, oh, he saw Joe Rogan in the supermarket. People are like, yeah, yeah, whatever, man. It could also be that some people don't like talking about their work. Some people, some people avoid talking about especially talking about the work of standup when there did not talk to a standup. Yeah, that I do that really? Yeah. Yeah. So you would just, you wouldn't mention that you were in the movie. I, I get away with not mentioning

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       it. I might just scared out of their cars. I will to you. I was still a small town boy because to me it's like you're in a movie. Oh shit man. Tell her. I will certainly tell you that I was in that movie if you brought it up, but you my friend. But if I didn't know you in some Weirdo at a party, I got to take a chance with that. Just talking about standup to you. Oh yeah. That's good movie. Hey, look over there. Chips and cheese puffs. My favorite. Yeah, I get cornered sometimes. I mean you've been cornered sometimes by people that just want to ask questions at you, like they're interviewing you. So what's going on with like, like right now I get a million people that want to corner me and asked me UFC questions because UFC just sold for some astronomical for billion dollar, whatever it is figure.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       Right. And uh, so everybody wants to talk to me. What's it like with the new owners? What's the EU? It was like, oh, gotta go gotta go. You become like a, someone that you're, you're instead of having a conversation with people like you're interviewing you and. Yeah. And it's one on one. It's not coming out on TV or something. Not even that. It's like, I don't, you know, I don't necessarily want to talk about my work detail in issues. Like what's it like working with my new bosses who gives a shit? No. Do you compartmentalize a lot? I mean, is there the UFC part of your life and there's the standup part of your life and it has to be the UFC because I don't swear. I very, very rarely like say shit or is that hard? No, no. It's all about her heart. I just, uh, I just, I don't think it's necessary.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       They don't like what I'm doing. I mean to keep [inaudible] you're used to talking on the podcast. Is it? I don't mean. Does it bother you? Didn't think you meant that even difficult? No, it's not difficult because it is a different, totally different mindset because I'm never trying to be funny. Like, do you remember when like Dennis Miller used to host Monday night football? Yeah, he did it for a little bit because he was trying to be funny. He was cracking jokes intersect and I remember remembering that. Yeah. But I didn't even watch it, but I remember people were like really pissed at Dennis Miller and I thought about it and I was like, well, I don't do that and I'm not gonna do that. And it's like he, you know, Dennis is a joke writer. He's, he's got, he's a joke teller, I've, I have bits, you know, it's kind of a different kind of comedy in the first place, but then on top of that it's like that thing that's going on to me doesn't require much of me.

Speaker 1:          01:52:14       What it requires is me to explain things. That's it. So it doesn't require personality or flay or senses of humor or a unique point of view other than unless I recognize something like a pattern that's happening at a fight that allows the people at home to enjoy it more. And it allows the person who's fighting the two people that are fighting it, it represents them in an honorable way. So that's my goal. That's all I'm trying to do when I'm there. I'm just trying to do my best to give justice to what I'm seeing and to do a great job with that. I don't even, I'm not into UFC. I've started watching it since I've been hanging out with you, you know, and I've gotten to know some of the personalities and I've watched the whole Ronda rousey thing and the, you know, this guy, Irish guy, conor mcgregor.

Speaker 1:          01:53:02       You fuck. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's pretty compelling and I think you do a very good job of that. Your ego isn't in play at all. No, it can't be just reporting. Yeah, I try as much as possible to stay outside of it. I mean I'm, I'm thinking because I want to. I mean I'm constantly trying to stay on the ball, but uh, at my best I'm just doing it, you know, it's like I have to be just tuned in, well rested, well fed, hyped up, ready to go. It's because it's a six hour thing, so I sit down for six hours and oftentimes it's a, it's always at least 10 fights. It's usually 11 or 12. You do all? Yup. All of all of them bring you in for the last few? No, actually like doing it that way because what happens is I get warmed up so I do like the first one because like sometimes fighting so crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:53:53       You have to go, oh yeah, okay. There's a fight going on, you know, like you're sitting in. I mean even though I've done it, I've called at least a thousand fights, probably closer to 2005. I don't know how many actual fights have been in front of while doing comedy or commentary rather, but it's at least a thousand. Let's say it's probably like 1500 or something, but even though that's the case to this day, when one starts, I go, okay, this is the fight, this is what's going on by the fifth fight of the night. I'm totally in the groove and I'm just laser focused, concentrated on the action, trying to pick the right words, trying to describe it in the right way and trying to give that, give that perspective to someone at home that might not be seeing something that I might be saying.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       Well, especially all the. The wrestling grappling techniques, that's a big part of it. That's a big part of it. People are used to seeing boxing and they dealt with an upper cut is or a book or whatever, but yeah, when they get on the ground, I have no idea what's going on. And you're talking about the arm bar or this and that? Yeah, that's the most difficult. Are you below the stage or. Yeah, below you see what's going on. One hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. Well sometimes I don't see like if the referee stands in front of me and then I have to look at monitoring. So I have two monitors in front of me and give me two completely different angles. You get splattered by swabbing blood, blood splatter on maybe before. Yeah. I've got into my mouth before one guy was talking to me and his nose was broken and every time he's talking at sprayed and around my lips. And you're on live television. Yeah. Be like, cut. Give me a fucking. Oh No. You mean he was talking man. Blood was coming out of his mouth. Jesus. Yeah, I've gotten sprayed. It's, that's a easy part. You know, their job is, was difficult. Like that's someone's blood like that, the guy getting hit and they're all tested HIV, you know, not everything, everything, everything.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       And uh, you know, guys have been stopped from fighting because of certain things that have come up in those tests. Uh, diseases and all kinds of shades. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Hepatitis, for sure. Some organizations have, you know, pulled guys off cards because they found the way you should infectious blood to blood. That's a bad thing to be. Getting. Staph infections are a real big deal too. Sometimes people will get staff from the fight or they're fighting and you find out the guy had like a sore staff. One wasn't alerting anybody to it. That happens. A biotic resistant now. Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Staff of scary stuff and it's one of those things that sort of rarely gets discussed, but I'm super important to keep healthy skin flora. I tell people this is one of the most important aspects of it. Don't use antibacterial soap. Don't do it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:30       You're going to ruin your skin. Flora your fucking agent orange in your whole skin, like don't do it. People think they're going to be healthier that way. I'm just gonna use antibacterial that way. I want to get into diseases. You'll get like crazy warts on your hands and shit like you gotta be real careful with that stuff. Yeah. You don't want to kill that flora. The Flora. This is something I researched for this book that this section is a big problem because you don't get the vaginal bath, have a skin flora and also intestinal. Dave actually rubbed vaginal like whatever that jazz is on baby post birth that have given us area and sections just to sort of that on them because if you don't it gets colonized by whatever is floating around in the air and you don't want what's floating in the air and the hospital. Fuck. Yeah, no. Yeah, it is a crazy thing. You know that there's a process and we don't. We don't. We think there was some details of that process. We can. We can skirt around that one. We don't have to blow the pussy out. No, no, no. We're just going to go through the roof. We're going to pop up a sunroof on that bitch and just it off on Monday. So this stitch them up. Everything's going to be fine. She looks great in the vagina. It retains its 100 percent of the last test.

Speaker 3:          01:57:39       We have to acknowledge where a couple of guys here, we're never going to have our taints slit. Oh, I get it. I get it to get it 100 percent. It's tough, but I have a friend and his wife like specifically with saying a baby is not blowing my pussy out. Not going to happen. Yeah, she, she's going through the roof. No matter what. I fucking get it. It's a circle. It's such a primitive way to give birth. You know the weirdest one is a Hyena. The hyena that gives birth out of that fake Dick. He a big glitzy, massive clip. What's a foe? Penis. I mean, it literally looks like a giant Dick and they're bigger. That's what's fucked up about them. They have a baby out of that thing too, and they ride the mail and try to fuck them with that fake Dick. Weird animal. Maddening is that. We're so lucky we don't have been here since I saw you. What'd you do over there? Yeah, so I was in Mexico first, then there was in Thailand for six weeks, and then I was in southern Africa. I did a 10 day safari.

Speaker 4:          01:58:43       Botswana. Yeah. Was that A. I wouldn't do the same thing again. Uh, it was, uh, it was cool. It was just wild dogs. Safaris who do this sort of like a low budget, get in the van and sleep in tents at night kind of thing. And I picked this like massive thousand, 1500 mile, whatever, like see all of southern Africa, which was dumb because you're just sitting in a van most of the time. What kind of shots did you have to get? I didn't get any shots for that. Really? Yeah. No, there's no yellow fever there. There's some malaria, but I've been in lots of places with malaria and I just avoid mosquitoes. How do you do that? You don't, uh, you have, uh, make sure you have a good net on your bed. Uh, you wear long sleeve light colored clothing, light colored like white or something like that because there really are attracted to darker colors.

Speaker 4:          01:59:33       Well, I think it's because you don't see them, you know, if you're, if you have a white sleeve, you'll see them landing and flying around. Oh, I see. You're just constantly on the alert for little disease carrying monsters. He, uh, and also, you know, allocational, he used some of the DDT shit on my ankles and my neck and stuff. Um, but the other thing is you eat a lot of raw garlic. Oh, I heard, I've heard that. That's real. Well, I mean that's, I've been doing it for years when I was on the road backpack and in places, tropical places. I was eating raw garlic every day, which is really good for your intestines, your intestinal flora and all that. But your skin smells like garlic. You start sweating it out right away. Oh, I smell like garlic all the time. People Complain, Oh, I love the smell. I like it too, but it's not good on your breath. Right? Agreed. Well, what what you do is you chop it up, put it, throw it in your mouth and drink it down with water. You don't chew it. I chew chewing. It's what gives you the breadth because it gets in your teeth. So if you take it like pills, you'll get the garlic belch when you get the garlic skin, but you don't get the garlic breath. I would feel like come

Speaker 1:          02:00:35       cheating because, uh, I'm kind of a glutton for those uncomfortable moments when you know you're doing something good like a chomping down the garlic and you feel those juices hit your tongue and you're like, whoa. You feel out, your nose starts opening up. I mix it with some fresh ginger. I just throw it down, man. Yeah, I mean anytime there's any feeling at all of stomach disease disease where if I feel bad, I don't feel like I'm a little rundown. I just choked down a bunch of cloves of garlic the other day I did it and it hit me so hard. I had to take a knee. I was like, aw. Like as it was going down, I was like, Whoa, man. Could have stood up. I wanted to sit down for dramatic purposes like wow, take a knee or praising the Lord. My goodness.

Speaker 1:          02:01:22       Garlic, what are you doing to my insides? I had a horrendous stomach virus right around new years. I went through my New Year's Eve show, convinced I was going to shit myself. I was like, there's gonna be a point in this show where I'm just going to have to shit myself. And I thought about it all day before the show. I didn't eat anything, anything all day. Like from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. I mean that was having broken fire hydrant experiences in the toilet. Liquid. Yeah. We were just like, where is all this coming from? You know, like I, I couldn't believe it. As I was saying, wait a minute, it was below anatomy. Something inside of me was terrible. Like whatever it was was terrible. I had these farts that were they, they smelled like fermented fruit in death, like death mixed with this fermented sulfur, like, like the most rotten meat you could ever cut.

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       Like if you opened up like a, a fridgerator and the power had gone off while you were on vacation and came back and there was some hamburger meat that was rotten. It smelled like that and like, like sulfur and like a sweet, like a vinegary, almost like a fermented sort of a smell to. It was getting belches were you getting sold? It was all going on in some of my stomach because I wasn't eating much and it was something that went around through my whole house. My, my littlest daughter got. I mean I didn't know what she was going through, but she was just constantly complaining about her stomach being really awful for like a whole week we were skiing in Aspen and that's when it kicked in and when I got back I was like, oh no, like this is bad. Have you. Have you ever had an event on stage now?

Speaker 1:          02:03:08       Like a wet fart or something or like, oh no I haven't, but interestingly enough, there's a new law that just got. Well, it might be proposed. A new rule got proposed for the unified rules of mixed martial arts where if you shit yourself, they stopped the fight, which has happened before because of shit themselves, like during the middle of a fight, just like loss of sphincter control. Yeah man. Sometimes you got to go like sometimes it's diarrhea, sometimes kick you in the fucking gut and just blast it out. The back, there was a guy named Michael [inaudible] who was a very good fighter and he was fighting biennials Douche, I believe. Yes. That's what the fight was. And Benito diary. It was a because I remember is a big victory for him because he choked biennials Dario out, which was a giant because Dario, she's like super respected Jujitsu, black belt and Michael Chester as he got into the octagon, looked over and he goes, dude, I might shit my pants because I might shit my pants.

Speaker 1:          02:04:00       Right, right. While the fights going on, I'm like, seriously? I was like, took my headphones off. Like, seriously? He's like, yeah, I'm going to shit my pants. And so like, okay. I know I sound like I'm holding this in the back of my head. I'm like, I definitely shouldn't bring it up unless it becomes an issue because I don't want the public to dwell on that. I want them to enjoy this great fight. And then he got through without shitting himself and then, uh, you know, I asked him after like off Mike, I'm like, did you almost treat yourself? It's like, dude, he goes, I came out here. I was convinced I was going to shit myself. I used to get like before I would go on a TV show or do a big public speaking thing where they're going to be a lot of people there. I would like five, 10 minutes before I was supposed to go on stage. I'd

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       be like, I need to take a dump. Like I need to do it right now. I've taken a few dumps here. Sorry about that. I'm more relaxed now. It's what it's for, but I think there's a, it's like a, you know, fight or flight thing. I think animals get that too. It's like, oh, this is, I gotta get my shit together. Literally get it out of me, so I'm like, yeah, you know there was. Well it's also your body does not want to waste any resources dealing with that because it feels like there's like some catastrophe about to take price. There's a video of these two bears, these giant bears and it was in that movie grizzly man, they're crazy dude, that song movie, but these two bears are fighting and while they're fighting they start shitting because their bodies just like, look, whatever this says, get it out, get it out.

Speaker 3:          02:05:23       We're going to war here. We're not practicing. Yeah, no, no thought whatsoever. And no resources drawn away from the muscles to process the food because have you ever done that? Like eating a big meal and try to work out. I never tried to work out, but if you did, you got nothing. No energy, no energy. It's fascinating because it's like, like it's almost like if you were a pie chart, you could see there's a segment of that chart that is now missing. You can kind of do it. You can kind of work out, but you definitely can't run a marathon or anything crazy. You can't. I mean, if you do, you'll be hurting all the fucking Wim Hoff. Man, you know, you've been on your show a bunch of times. I hung out with him for like a week and the Pyrenees and went up to his place in Holland and like sort of became friends.

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       I mean, that's an example of what I'm talking about. I want to know these people, you know, like when I reached out to them, they were like, yeah, we'll set up a thing. You can do a skype. And I was like, fuck that. I don't want to do a skype. I want to meet this dude, you know, like, tell me, give me a day. I'll fly to Holland. I was in Spain at the time, so it wasn't a big flight. But anyway, I was talking to him about it and it's like he's running all these marathons in the fucking desert with no water and in the Arctic and you know. Yeah. But the dude doesn't work out. No, he runs marathons. He doesn't work out. He doesn't run because I hate running. Yeah. I'm like, well, how do you run a marathon if you don't train?

Speaker 3:          02:06:44       He's like, oh, it's just the mind. Yeah. I don't know what he's talking about. I ran a five k and I was ready to die, run up the fucking driveway. I about her brother and I don't run and I ran a five k and I was like, wow, this is actually difficult. I'm like, I'm in great shape. I'm like, this, I'm going to be able to do this. I work out all the time. I'm like, I'm just going to go on this run is going to be just a thing I do because we're not used to using those muscles in that way. Or was it was was his cardiopulmonary waffle covered with peanut butter and then covered with maple syrup. I gave myself an excuse. I'm like, I'm going to run this crazy race car book, but my body's just not used to eating that nonsense, so I think it had shut down production of a lot of key ingredients. There was definitely that feeling like when I was running, I could feel like offices from them waffle coming

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       up my throat. I can taste it, kick it in the peanut butter and syrup together. So much sugar. But it's all just, you know, your feet, your feet aren't used to running on. It was on concrete. The whole thing is weird in the shocks on your knees and your ankles. You ever read, born to run? No. No, but I do know the premise of it. Chris and Doug Dogo. It's about the way shoes running shoes are developed and yeah, and how our bodies are designed to run on the balls of her feet and he goes down in the lives with the Tarahumara Indians in Mexico and the bank, they'll Kobe where I was in 1988, so I was back there with those Indians and they run into like really thin shoes or barefoot barefoot or they make these sandals out of the tire, you know, and it's just strapped on their foot. It's just a thing. And they run forever. Yeah. Well, that's how the body's meant and I mean we're, we're meant to use the foot as this amazing shock absorber, you know, you land on the ball, the frame it was him. That's what the calf muscles for. Yeah. And also the arch and there are all these bones. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy short. It's like the birth thing, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:08:43       thing yesterday. The sock is same thing. I mean it's supposed to be replacing that barefoot feeling, I suppose. It's a really expensive sock. It's like 80 bucks. Just a sock, but kind of a. it's made, it shows at the end of the video shows what it's made of. It's got some sort of spray polymer that's like 15 times stronger than steel. Whoa. So you can like do rock climbing, tightrope walking or running outside and it's just as a guess. It feels like silk. It's it, it feels just like a sock. Holy Shit. I'm pretty interested in it. I don't know how legit it is, but just get it pretty new. I work out barefoot most of the time. I work out barefoot when I do kickboxing, workout, barefoot. If I do Jujitsu, workout barefoot, if I lift weights, I do almost everything barefoot. Occasionally I'll do like an elliptical machine or something like that with shoes on, but I feel like when you are barefoot, like I do yoga barefoot, obviously. I feel like when you're barefoot you get to feel your toes are like digging into the ground. The rolling.

Speaker 4:          02:09:36       I just, I feel like it makes a big difference in a lot of the nervous system terminates in the sole of the feet. So there's, in Chinese medicine there's a lot of um, attention paid. Reflexology is about how, you know, I don't know how real it is, but it is real that the, a lot of the nervous system terminates at the soles of the feet. That's why foot massage feels so good. And so the theory is with this barefoot shit is that by having that experience you're describing where your toes are digging in and you're feeling your weight being shifting in different parts of your foot. Having that part of your body alive, inactive is really good for your overall psychological health and nervous health. Does that makes sense? Does make sense? Yeah. It just feels good to do and there's like, you feel good for a reason, right? You know the word evolve too. To have them feel good because it's good for us. Brings us back to beaten off or fucking one of those

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       dog things. I drinking off a dog with A. I wonder if we should call that company and ask questions and they say like, what kind of dog do you have? Oh, I don't have a dog. Yeah, this nefarious intentions. I just like watch dogs. Fuck robots. It's just for dogs that wonder by my friend Joe when I was growing up, Joe Spagnolo and he had a. He had a dog that was just like really ornery little dog and his dog had a stuffed animal that it would fuck and it would just bite this stuffed animal and fuck the shit out of it. And you'd come over his house. Joe's bags. You'd go over his house and his dog would be fucking the shit out of this stuffed animal. And you're like, whoa. How'd you'd clean it? I don't know. I mean, you couldn't even go near that thing. That dog was like, he would get ferocious if you tried to get near his stuffed animal. There's a little tiny ass dog too. I don't remember what he was. That's like your friend with the restraining order, man. Love is love, you know, there's no way around it to do. But that dog was obsessed. That was his world. His world is like biting the stuffed animal and just plug into have.

Speaker 3:          02:11:46       Hey, somebody asked me to raise an issue with you. Uh, apparently you've, you're under the impression that everyone died at 30 and prehistory. Is that true? Uh, I, I joke around about that all the time that lifespans were incredibly low. A long time ago. Lived to be like 30, you know, it's a hyperbole for the most part. Okay, good. I know people did leave love live longer, but the age that people died, the average age was much lower than it is today just because lots of babies died. So it's, yeah, it's a mathematical average. But species by design by has evolved to live into our sixties and seventies and hunter gatherers who get through the first few years where there's a lot of risk. So it's a huge thing also. It's all rounded out math thing. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. So I was under the impression that people just got diet of violence and a lot of diseases by the time they were in their thirties.

Speaker 3:          02:12:37       No. Most of the diseases that we suffer from are the result of agriculture. So you look at all the major killers of, of humans. Swine flew from pigs or chicken pox from chickens. Obviously Avian Flus come domesticated. And Jamie would, he posted up there? Human lifespan. Nearly constant for 2000 years. Oh. So like ultimate lights fan. But when I was talking about most of these diseases and violence, yeah. The, the violence thing is overrepresented if you, unless you live in Mongolia. If you read the. Yes, what is it? Seventy five. And I don't know if that looks free. History is this? No. Good. Okay. Uh, life expectancy for men in 19. Oh, seven was 45 years. Forty five years by 1957, it rose to 66, 2007 to reach 75. Unlike the most recent increase in life expectancy, which is attributed

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       largely to a decline in half of the leading causes of death, including heart disease, homicide and influenza. The increase in life expectancy between 19 Oh, seven and 2007 with largely due to the decreasing, decreasing infant mortality rate, which is like nine point nine, nine percent. That's interesting. So what that is like is like the wage gap, the gender wage gap issue, right? Where a lot of people say they love to quote that thing that say that men make so much more money than women that women make eighty cents to the dollar, but they're doing different jobs. Right? So like you think about it, you go, wow, there's an injustice going on. And then you realize like, well maybe there is some sexism, but this is not what they're talking about when they're saying this. They're talking about different jobs. The men are at higher risk, they die more often on the job. Men like when they almost exclusively populated the community of minors and lumber jacks and shit like that, where people get hit by trees and women take time off when they have kids and they also work less hours. They're less crazy. Some men will fucking work themselves to death. Were very few women will. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:14:36       Take it to that list. Certainly are plenty of examples of men and women doing exactly the same job and women are getting paid less. I'm sure it must have been, but it's not statistically significantly. It's not what you're talking.

Speaker 1:          02:14:48       They attribute that from the. When women get less, they think that one thing to be considered when you look at that is that women might not be as aggressive when they're negotiating a starting salary and that men may be more confident and cock shore of their worth more cocky with how they, uh, who knows though. I don't, but it's one of those things. So I was under the impression that people did die.

Speaker 2:          02:15:10       Yeah. Well, most people are under that impression. I've, I've had, I've spoken, given talks at medical schools and stuff and all these doctors think that everyone died at 35 to 35 year old results and they're like, and it works its way into medicine where they're like, okay, look, the reason you have chronic back pain is that the human body was not evolved to live beyond 35, and so of course you have wear and tear and things like that's totally false. The human bodies evolved to live into the seventies, so it's a statistical thing. It's like if Bill Gates moves into your neighborhood, suddenly everyone's average annual salary is million, hundreds of millions of dollars, right? So if you count all these infants who died in prehistory, many of whom by the way died from infanticide. Like twins normally are not allowed to survive. The, the weaker one is left in the woods to die.

Speaker 2:          02:16:00       Yeah. Any sort of deform and mal formality, we just leave them in the woods by themselves. What a cruel way to handle it. Yeah. Oh, that's dark man. They would leave him to wolves. That's fucked up, man. Leave your baby in a basket. And run away. Ooh, yeah. There's a lot of, a lot of infanticide, but you know, in our world, a lot of it, huh? Yeah. Well, just because of the times were harder than. And it was more accepted that you were going to have to do some terrible things that you didn't want to do. Well, it's just, you know, if a kid's

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       born physically fucked up in some way, you know, you're not gonna, you're not gonna have the resources and that kid's not going to, that person's not going to grow up to contribute to the group. And so generally, and also there's a different sense of life and death, you know, I think we're death is much more a daily presence. It's not that big a deal. So we're all going to die there. I was reading about a tribe in the Amazon. Uh, I can't remember the name of the tribe, but when someone gets too old to keep up with the group, someone has chosen randomly, like they have a lottery or pick the shortest straw or whatever it is. And their job is to come up behind this old person and hit him in the back of the head with a hatchet.

Speaker 1:          02:17:18       Oh boy.

Speaker 4:          02:17:20       Right. And no one wants to do it. It really sucks, but everyone agrees it has to be done. And it's the least cruel option that they've come up

Speaker 1:          02:17:31       real careful to do to keep signing up for that job. Exactly. Got It. Last time. So Papa Joe, you've killed nine old ladies this way. This bitches gone over. Okay. We'll just let her stop. Ooh, that's weird.

Speaker 4:          02:17:48       That's a weird gig. So anyway. No human being has ever been old at the age of four. Look at this

Speaker 1:          02:17:54       heartbreaking pictures of parents leaving their children in China's notorious baby hatches. So yeah. What is that? Well, that's, that's probably girls. The moment of despair. As parents cling to their children for one last time before abandoning them in China's so called baby hatches, the father kisses his child, her face hidden in a blanket. The mother holds her hooded baby has their shadows are cast upon the last door they will pass through together. Another collapses to the ground, reaching out to touch her son for the last time. What in the fuck? Oh my God, the baby is. She says in quotes, my baby cannot take care of itself when it grows up. One woman cries explaining that her infant has down syndrome. I just want my baby to survive. She tells the information times news based in. I don't know how to say that. Guang huge owl. She had an accompanying female friendly. Both in tears. Fuck man.

Speaker 4:          02:18:48       Well, this has been happening forever. I mean, we have safe baby drop

Speaker 1:          02:18:52       Bob's here. Every hospital has a sign that it's a safe baby. Drop off. Take that off the screen or

Speaker 4:          02:19:00       and in medieval Europe it was so common that they had these little boxes that rotated and so you could leave your baby and just spin the box. They didn't have to look at it. No one would ever see, you know. See who was dropping it off. It was anonymous. Oh my God. Very common. They called a foundling hospitals and over 90 percent of the babies left there died bad

Speaker 1:          02:19:25       boy in Germany. They had with. What are they called? Angel makers?

Speaker 2:          02:19:30       This, and this is through the beginning of the 20th century up to World War II. It was a nanny that you hired with the understanding that your baby was going to die,

Speaker 1:          02:19:40       so it was like a babysitter who's going to kill your baby? Oh my God. Yeah, so you would hire this nanny because your kid had down syndrome or some sort of a disease or something like that, or it was born out of wedlock, you know, whatever. The nanny would kill the baby. Oh my God. They called them angel makers. The idea that infanticide was historically significant. It's significant in the death of the population that that was so common.

Speaker 2:          02:20:06       Well, I mean today we have abortion and I don't want to get into, you know, heavy shit, but like now if a baby's inconvenient or there's a disease that's detected or whatever, you know, cut it off at the past, you cut it off at the pass. In those days there wasn't. So it was sort of postnatal abortion essentially. I feel like abortion is one of those subjects were

Speaker 1:          02:20:24       ideally upon breaching the subject. There's a tension in the room. I've just felt it. I apologize for it. You know, you're right. There's no way. Because the thing is both sides are. Right, right. That's the problem. You're 100 percent, right? Yeah. That's 100 percent the problem. Yeah. And there are a lot of issues like that. Yeah. It's one of those things where people screaming at you and get crazy and they'll pick a side and it's death and it's this and it's that and it's, it's a woman's choice to choose. And it's, you're both right. You're both right. Like I got in an argument once with the comedian about it and he, it was about Richard Dawkins was talking about a, um, it was on twitter that an embryo, human embryo is like, it's almost no different than a pig embryo. Like he was making this about at six weeks of life or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:21:14       It would be a very, very, very early age. I guess not even, that wouldn't even be an embryo. Right. What would it be? Still an embryo, an embryo. Then right, okay, so an embryo is the earliest stages and he was comparing it to a pig and I was like, well, you know how crazy that is a ridiculous thing to say because it's not going to be a pig, but if you leave it alone it's going to be a person so you know it's going to grow up to be a person. Like. It's like saying that it's no different than a pig. It's totally disingenuous. So I mean this comedian, we were arguing and he started calling me, you a right winger. He's like saying that I was, that I was writing. I'm like, I am not right wing, but you are definitely killing a person that's about to be born.

Speaker 1:          02:21:49       I mean, that's what you're doing. You're cutting it off. What you cut off at three cells or three months. It's the same thing. It really is. I mean, be. It's not. It's not. It becomes. It becomes much more like a baby. It looks more like a baby. It's more, it's more intensive and a procedure, but once the process is started, you've decided at various stage of the way that it becomes okay. You know, like late term abortions are frowned upon by almost everybody. Right? When you get into the fucking the last couple of weeks of a baby's life, you can't really. Or before it gets birth, nobody. Very few people are going to agree that you could just suck out the baby with a vacuum when it's nine months old. You know? That's, that's a little intense, right? Almost everybody agrees that's a little intense. So that means that we all have some sort of a reasonable cutoff. Anybody who believes in abortion, we have some sort of a reasonable cutoff will were accepted when it's a bundle of cells, when it's. When it looks like a fish, like when is it? Okay, when's it okay. And that's all I'm saying. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't be able to do it and it's definitely not my choice. I don't have a body that makes baby.

Speaker 2:          02:22:49       And do you think it starts at conception or jerking off? Killing millions of.

Speaker 1:          02:22:54       Because jerking off doesn't ever make that connection, there's not, it's not a viable. So it is conception process that started. I mean I don't necessarily think life starts at conception. I mean I literally have. I mean if someone can prove like if you had a Turkey tester that pops up when you're pregnant, like the moment, Oh shit, we got one and you can just push that sucker down. That egg would shoot out. That fertilized egg would shoot out of your pussy and then that would be a wrap. I got no problem with that. Right? I don't know a problem with any of it. I mean I do. I think intellectually I don't. I wouldn't say I have a problem with it because again, I submit that I don't have a vagina, I don't have ovaries, I don't have a womb. I'm not making babies. I have an opinion and that's it.

Speaker 1:          02:23:35       There's no way I should be able to say yes or no when I see it as this weird sort of a situation where we've figured out a way to terminate life inside the body where we can't see it yet. It hasn't come out and said, hi, Hi Daddy. It hasn't done that yet, so we could hit the brakes. Okay. I don't want to. I don't want to do it. Whew. We figured it out. I don't think that there's. I don't necessarily think it's wrong or right, but it is a thing. You know, it's a thing and people require that you speak of this thing in the way they speak of this thing and if you don't, they are fucking ready to Duke. They're ready to duke it out with you. I, I.

Speaker 2:          02:24:11       because the differentiation is the pro choice. People are saying it's not a life and the other people are saying you're killing a living thing. A person and I'm, I'm in there where it's like, no, you are killing something, but it's not a person now yet. So I agree with both. Right. You know, but fundamentally I agree with what you just said, which is it's really none of my fucking business. It's not my body and no woman can tell me whether you get a vasectomy or not or the prostate exam or whatever the fuck it is. They just passed a law in Arkansas or somewhere that husbands need to be informed before woman can have an abortion and a husband can stop it even if she's been raped.

Speaker 1:          02:24:55       That's medieval. That's ownership person. Yeah. A husband or a wife. Being able to tell the other one what they can or can't do with a medical procedure. That's illegal. That becomes like an owner. That definitely becomes an ownership issue. Like if your wife told you you couldn't get a vasectomy, I will not allow it, but what? I will not allow you to eat meat either. I will not allow you to have ice cream fat. Fuck. No. Like all of a sudden she decides what you're going to eat out. It will not allow you to keep that haircut. Ryan. That way all

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       the time. Oh, I would never let my husband buy blah blah. Like what? Your husband's a pussy. Yeah. Well, and your wife is under threat or in, you know, under ownership. If she allows the same sort of situation like guy makes her do things. Yeah. I've known people that are. Their husbands have made them get plastic surgery. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, talk him into it. You know, I want you to do this for me. Get the big tits. Yeah, get the lips, lips, the lips to do something by your nose. I don't like your nose. Bothered me. You'd be prettier, baby. I'll show you off. Weird, weird. You fix your notes. And then there are those people who like who like fatties, you know? Then the, they feed the other person. It's part of their eroticism to feed you as much as possible so you get as fat because I love you and getting, you know, it's not cool.

Speaker 2:          02:26:17       Very strange. People are fucking weird man. You know, I don't think hunter gatherers are kinky. No, no. This is the thing. I think kink is a response to a fucked up environment. So I think yeah, it's this weird pressure. It's conflict between the impulse and what's allowed. So it comes out in this weird, distorted way. I think that makes total sense. So yeah, hunter gatherers, there's not, as far as I know, there's no evidence of Kink, tarred to get latex. Let's face it, the jungle, although that's where it comes from originally. If you've ever met Wade Davis, by the way. No, you should meet that guy who is fascinating. I just had him on my podcast. He's an ethnobotanist. She live around here. He lives in Vancouver. Um, but he's an author. He, I'm sure he comes to la regularly, but, uh, he's the guy actually we were talking about five Meo dmt.

Speaker 2:          02:27:12       He was, he and Andrew Weil isolated that for the first time, uh, as white people. Anyway, he studied at Harvard. Then he went to the Amazon for a long time. He worked, lived with a lot of tribes. They're very interested in hallucinogens. He's written a bunch of books. His first book was about Voodoo, um, something about the horsemen of the apocalypse or something like that. He wrote a book called one river. He's written seven or eight books. He's a national geographic explorer in residence. He's the super bad ass dude. Damn. I told one of his stories on your podcast a long time ago about this Eskimo Dude, old guy in the family said, Grandpa, you know, we get to take away the keys to the snow machine because you can't see so well, and he's like, fuck you guys. In that night he went out, it was winter in the Arctic somewhere. He took a shit and he fashioned a blade from his shit out of the snow and well he killed the dogs and he made a harness out of the dog's skin and a little sled out of the dog's ribs. And then he like tied in three or four other dogs and then he fucking took a took off across Tundra.

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       Anyway, that's a way David's story. He's like, he. So he made a knife out of his own chef. He froze his night. He, he forms the blade and then he took some. He freezes and then he takes them spit and he rubs it along the edge and apparently that's what gives it the razor sharpness. Yeah. And then he fucking kills his dog with a shit knife. That's right. I remember that. There's another story, Davis, how I bought Zombie poison in America inside the eclectic quarter of award winning writer Wade Davis, former national geographic explorer in residence, ethno, botanists and park ranger is a super cool guy. Christ what? A life that guys lived. Yeah. Yeah. He's A. Again, that's the guy like I want to fucking meet these galleries. Yeah. Yeah. So he's cool. He's up in Vancouver. Well, listen man. Unfortunately I got a book. Yeah, we can do this alone to time though, man.

Speaker 3:          02:29:13       You're a. you're in the back in the states. I am. I got nothing to sell. I had no. Doesn't matter, man. Lazy Hippie lifestyle that will promote your podcast. Tangentially speaking. So hilarious. Awesome podcast. And you do it fairly recently? Fairly often. Every week. Every week. Okay, cool. That's awesome. And let's do this more often. Dude. Year round. I'm here and it's that Chris Ryan. Now. It used to be Chris Ryan, phd on twitter, but Duncan trussell fucking ruined him. And Brendan Walsh, they stole my phd. Those fuckers, they put phd next to their name. Now Phd doesn't mean anything anymore, so that Chris Ryan. Thanks brother was awesome, man. Yeah, you too. See you guys. Bye.
