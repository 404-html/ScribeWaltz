Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Three, two, one, boom. And we're live with happened in Joe. What's up Mike Thompson girls in the house for man minutes here by to say hi. I can't believe you've never had a cup of coffee. Never. Do you want some know that that might be. That might be the most outrageous thing about you is that you've never had coffee your whole life. Ever had coffee. Now did you just tea, never coffee. No one ever offered you a cup of coffee. He never went to starbucks? No. Fatigue with and donut. Wow. What about like when I was in Rehab, you always got to go to starbucks because the meetings right outside of starbucks, he always hang out at starbucks. Right, but never for coffee. You didn't want to try it? Never. Hmm. That is that. How about like, like girlfriends wives? Like none of them ever drank coffee at home.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       I'm sure they have. I never really, my wife drinks it and you'd just nothing. No, nothing. No. No. Well, I'm so addicted to drugs that, did you think coffee? It'd be nothing. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like it doesn't make any sense. When, when did you first try any drugs? Um, kid and your kids? What kind of Shit? Smoking and drinking. Right. Then as I got older I tried to ask it. How old were you when he first tried to ask her? 11. Wow. Really Young. Jesus man. Wow, that's really young. Wow. But when you were the champ, when you were in your prime, like when you, when like when you beat Trevor Berbick when you doing anything back then was drinking a lot. Drinking a lot. Really? Yeah. That's amazing. Well you go clean for camp or like if a camp just for camp, the camp outside once fights over and say, yeah, you were the first guy that I ever used as an example of a to break that old myth that you can't have sex before fights.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       And I was like, well that's out the window for sure. Cause you, you would talk about it all the time. He'd be like, yeah, yeah, I'm pretty much yet your logic made sense to you? Like I don't want to think about it. I don't want to be thinking about sex. I'll just get it out of the way. Yeah. And there's over what do, you don't have to do it. You have fuel for the next six weeks and it's going to fight. Do you think that was a myth that it made you weak? Yeah, I think it's a myth. Yeah. It doesn't seem to make sense. It seems odd. Yeah. And then whenever the spy you more so than the synagogue too, I would think they said that the Olympic, uh, you know where the athletes stay, it's just like fuck fest. Oh yeah. They had the boy and the girl if the thing facility, yeah. We also probably want to leave. You ate some anxiety, anxiety, freaking out. You're at the Olympics, you know, you're 18 years old and everyone's in amazing shape. Dresses out. Stressed out. Yeah. When you were, when you were first coming up and when you were first, uh, we, you like when you were

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       a kid, dynamite on sports illustrated. I'll never forget that man. That was a, that your era from like, you know, the 80s, the late eighties, that error, like it was a big part of my youth. You know, like, yeah man, you being the chant. It was like, it was a change of things because when Larry Holmes was the champ, as a boxing fan, I loved Larry Holmes. Like there's that cover. You were 19 years old, right? It's nuts. When Larry Holmes was the champ as a boxing fan, why you still got that stuff, man. You can still get those sports illustrated. It's the Internet. You can find it on the Internet. That's how Jamie got it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Um, I had that sports illustrated, but when Larry Holmes was a, a champ, as a boxing fan, I appreciated him. I knew he was a great fighter. I, I, you know, we would get together with friends and watch like the, the, the Michael spinks fight with Larry Holmes. When spinks beat him for the title. It was a big deal, but it wasn't a big deal. Culturally. Yeah. People didn't care as much. But then you came around and when you came around, all this sudden everybody's watching heavyweight boxing. Heavyweight boxing wasn't, it wasn't boring again. It was the, the most crazy exciting thing in sports. When your fights would go on, it would be about, should I pay for this cause how long is this going to last? Like dad never. We had people telling me about that

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       come, they all chipped in and took a fight on the phone. I know. Think about it like that, you know, sometimes

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       when it comes from out

Speaker 3:          00:04:33       realization of the situation, I forget that I'm that guy. I forget that train that hard and I became a fighter and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you. Like d does it seem like a dream?

Speaker 3:          00:04:42       Yeah, pretty much like a blur

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       because I, I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be 19 years old, 20 years old at that fucking famous. It was a trip. Who, who can handle that is then, can anybody handle that?

Speaker 3:          00:04:57       No. It was a trip, but it was just what to mind, you know, that was his blueprints and make me teenage superstar.

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       Did he give you advice on how to handle pressure and fame and

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       Oh, depression, everything, but you know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       It, there's really no um, ingredients. We'll have a handle thing,

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       you know what I mean? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:18       we have to see what, what I'm department of fame is your problem and we have to work on that issue from there. But no ones knows how to conduct themselves under that kind of pressure. No,

Speaker 4:          00:05:30       the level of fame too, it's like there's so many, you realize there's so many levels of fame and then Mike's is still just extraordinary where like people, people walk away from their job, like an airport. They're supposed to be at the cash register and they run out, you know, they leave their job to go say hi, that's not, you know, most of the time I'd be like, oh, that's who that person is. It's a totally thing.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Or where does that

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       pretty weird confidently get used to this device to be willing to like get the fuck away from me, man, when you're doing creep, I never knew how to conduct myself. I might come in and take a picture, take a picture of my kid, take a picture here, take a picture of it. I love this and that. And I'm like, Whoa, dude, cool out. You know what I mean? But now, you know, I understand this is just what it is. It is what it is and you're not going to be able to stop it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       Yeah. I've seen you at the UFC before. You're very calm around people on people grabbing at, you want to take pictures. He just, just relax. You got to see is awesome cause everybody's nuts. Yeah. That's a, it's a, it's definitely a wild environment. What do you think of beeps going to do now? But I think who could be, um, while he does whatever the fuck he wants to do, that's where I think, I think that goes probably the best lightweight of all time. He's a monster credible. He, um, I think he's probably gonna have some fights at 170 pounds eventually, if I'd imagine at 155. There's, you know, there's good fights for him. Tony Ferguson's a great fight for him. Um, uh, really interested in seeing that. Uh, I'm really interested in seeing him going up a really interesting to see him fight at 170 pounds from the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:07:10       Well, first of all, tyron Woodley, who was the champ at 170 that that would be an insane fight. George St Pierre. If he decided to come back and make a big super fight, that would be an insane fight. I think 170 has a lot of opportunities for them, but I think 155 does too. They just have to figure out who's going to fight him. He's an international superstar now. You know, could be, especially the way he smashed connor connor. Such a superstar ready that the way it could be one and did it so dominant. I think he's, I think he's through the roof now. I think when people, when he comes back and people see the paper view numbers of his fights are going to realize how huge this guy is because he's so interesting. He's very humble, very, very. He's very polite, very well spoken and very religious guy.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       Lives with his family, lives with his parents, lives with his parents, his family, I believe. I hope I'm not speaking out of school. I believe that's true. And obviously it doesn't have to for money and he's rich as shit now, but he's just a monster. The best, best grappler I've ever seen inside the 155 pound division. He just smashes people. He's thinking about Jon Jones. What? W in what way? And it was still his skill. He's phenomenal. Incredible. The best ever it using distance. He knows distance better than anybody. He's a master at knowing when he can hit you and you can't hit him with watching them fight. You know what I mean? He's been fighting as much anymore. He's back. He just one, just one the title again, just fun. Alexander Gustafson. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago. Yeah. For Bacon Peyto it was Daniel Cormier, Aka relinquish his title and it was like, it's weird, right? Like call me a is the champ because Jon Jones tested positive for something. So they stripped him and then call me a, became the champ. It's, uh, you know, I think they'll probably fight again whether they fight again and heavyweight or light heavy. Really? Yeah. I core main Jon Jones

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       and Cormier, he wants to keep going, but he says he wants to retire soon. He's 40, you know? Yeah. It feel looks good. He looks great. Especially at heavyweight and heavyweight. He's, he doesn't have to cut weight. He's got so much strength and s two so agile, he's such a unbelievable wrestler too. I mean his wrestling skill, his skill level and understanding of wrestling so high, so above most p anybody find out finally doing John Jones? He dominated. Yeah. Yeah. That's how good John Is. John's dad. Good. He's that. I mean, it just sucks that he's had so many controversies in his life, but I'm hoping he puts all that shit behind him. Have you ever spoken with him about that? Never been his personal life and live when we met before and talk. But you're a guy who's gone. I mean, when you went through legal problems yourself, you, you overcame, you came out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       On the other hand, I think would think a guy like him could benefit a lot from, but it's just so difficult and you're throwing fucking, did they have to go through something like that, you know? Do you think so? Yeah. [inaudible] you know, cause sometimes people, um, they will survive situations like that because they're so wild and they're having a good time too much in the party and the champ, it has to have to come to an end. That stuff, if you don't bring it to the next club, bring it could come to his own and it might not like that way then. Yeah. So you think for a guy like him, maybe getting in trouble was a good thing if only if you learn from experiences like that. You know, I think I was just a wild guy. I was really a wild guy. I look at myself now and I feel myself when I spent those trips and those psych wards and thought that, what was that all about? What, what's wrong with me back then, you know? Yeah. And I must say I was really disturbed back then.

Speaker 4:          00:10:38       But you're somebody who got to the point where you got like, it's really fascinating because I know you're not, you're a public figure. So I, you know, I've been able to watch you my whole life. You went through all that stuff and then you got to this point where you are very self reflective and you look at, you are able to comment on it. I don't think most, I mean most people regardless of whether they're famous or not, just still don't get to that point where they're able to look back and examine who they were and doing wild shit and with ruth

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       honesty. Yeah. That's what's so great reflecting itself to discover who you really are. Yeah. When you're 20 years old and all of a sudden you're the heavyweight champion of the world and just a few years ago you were poor and now all of a sudden you're the king of the world. That's really crazy. You're not so really crave that. I was, I was unable to handle it. I wasn't expecting that. That was a really sucker punch right there and the real sucker punch. Right? Yeah. I wasn't ready for that one. Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's animated. It's on youtube now of you and him coming over your house in a limousine and you had a, it was a lion or a tiger. Tiger. He must though the line for it the way. Yeah, the tiger. It is one of the craziest fucking stories.

Speaker 4:          00:11:49       I always win. So for people that don't know, I got to hang out with you at one of my shows one time and it was a great, I had the best time talking about everything. What made you think you could get a tiger? Like how did that even happen?

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       Hey, I'm in. Um, and so, um, I'm in prison at the time, so I'm in prison. I'm talking to my car dealer at the time and he has this, he has some caused the belonged to a friend of mine that's supposed to friend of ours and he's discussing the fee doesn't pay for these cars. I'm to sell these cars to somebody and get some horses and stuff. I said, well he can get a horses. Horses are for card. Cause I had a lot of cards. I said I probably get some horses. Yeah man, you get, you get cool goods. Lions, tigers. I love this guy. Got exactly what I see you do. Can you get me some tigers? Yeah. And the guy told me and the guy from, imagine how cool that would be be cause I had a bunch of fans because magnetic man, he'd be in the afternoon or for Rami. You have a tiger right next to you, man. And I'm saying to myself why that would be cool. Right after he had gave me some cousin and then I came home, I had those cubs. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:12:55       They're waiting for me. So you raised them as cubs? Yeah, because that's, that's how you work. Because I would see footage of you like fucking smacking them around and jumping on one of your tires. And I was like, Holy Shit. And I had my third baby and their mother, the mother babies. Now she never gets, this is a crazy picture. You and your underwear with a tiger on a chain that is, that is one of the, that's that's you at peak. Crazy. Yeah, and thing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       What was going through my mind. Yeah. No, it made me think about my friends and Mike. You can get from our from animal. Nothing really are serious. I'm going to give him a whole effort. Everybody does it though.

Speaker 4:          00:13:34       So one of the things about, uh, with, what's his face from narcos? Pablo Escobar, he got like a fucking zoo. I had a whole crazy zoo. They all do it. Once you get like that rich, you're like, just get some animals, some animals and they throw people in there with the Lions and tigers. Real common thing that is super rich people. They start getting lunch and shit. Jacqueline had all that stuff. That's right. Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson. Yeah. They had like a zoo in his backyard. He had weird shit. Like weird birds. Yeah. I don't think it may be at a monkey or something. He did have weird shit. Nothing dangerous day before the playboy mansion. This is at the end of his career. That was like whoa. The thing years ago or something. It was pretty awesome. Yeah. That guy, man. What a life. He loved. He'll pajamas balls. When you say 80 and shit, they're like, oh no.

Speaker 4:          00:14:35       Eighties deep into his eighties nineties yeah. He really, here's the thing that dude lived the lifestyle he was talking about. You know a lot of people talk shit. Yeah, you don't really do that. He was really doing it, I thought would be dark or fucking dog. You you blue wall. That's just too much. Yeah. Much one other thing. I got it cause I got to run and I wanted that I hadn't had gone man, I gotta go, I gotta go meet the wife Man. I do it. They'll do it. I read one time cause oh wait. So for people that know I, I met Mike on a flight and it was a surreal experience, you know, like from, from being a kid and thinking like this is superman. That's what I thought I was a kid. It's just, you know what I mean? Like seeing those when you see it as a kid too, I think it's different.

Speaker 4:          00:15:20       Like you're just like, whoa, that is so nuts. Like these 11 second knock out periodically. Even to this day, people come up to me and talk about the experience that they feel, how many talked about meeting me and through that true all it takes honestly, mostly stories that true. Yeah, mostly stories. And it was a, it was a surreal experience. And, and you know, we spoke on the plane and then like when I thought we were done talking, you know, I face forward and then he came back and like tapped me on the shoulder. I was like, Oh shit. Like Mike's talking to me, I'm down here like the seatbelt, seatbelt it in. But then we land and he was like, Oh, where's your show? And, and, and I go, oh, it's here. I gave him the number, never expect to hear, hits me up the next day.

Speaker 4:          00:16:06       And he's like, we're coming to your show. And I was like, oh my God. And I really did say like, I'm amazed that you're coming. And he said, it's all love. And I just said, I love you because I didn't know how to what to say. And then that was good. He was like, cool. He's like, all right, man. And I, I remember I called the, uh, the Pittsburgh improv manager and I go, hey man, I just go, you're not gonna believe this, but Tyson is coming to the fight tonight. And he goes, Mike Tyson, I go, no fucking Tyson chicken. Yeah, Mike Tyson is coming tonight. He was like, I'll corridor off a whole thing. And you know, and I didn't know he was at the show because the show had already started and I didn't see him arrive. When we go back to the green after the show, I walk offstage and he grabs me and he goes, let's go to the green room.

Speaker 4:          00:16:54       So he took me to my green room, right? Like he would like, and I was like, fuck. Yeah. And we hung out in that green room over an hour and just shooting the shit and talking. And when I forgot, like if at the time had passed, I opened the door, the entire staff, entire staff is lined up at the door to meet him. Like that's the effect that he has on the group. You know, like they're waiting in a line for an hour outside of the green room and like, you know, we talked about boxing about life. It was, it was fascinating. One of the things I really appreciated about you as a fighter was like, that you really knew that you were putting on a show. So that, that's something that I feel like I miss. You know, there's, there's no one that put on the show the way you did. Like you knew that people bought tickets and paid for the paper view. Um, and then it, you know, it's still like one of my great memories, man. It was a thrill to meet you. Um, so I just wanted to stop by and say hi and I was like, you're wrapping up, ramping it up.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Yeah. He has to go. Oh, by the way, did you buy seven Bentley's that were the same color?

Speaker 3:          00:17:56       No, but I bought it around seven Bentley's before damn near Rolls Royces. I wanted to ask you, you did give away one when you crashed it, right. Gotten, um, I was married at the time, the robin givens, and we were in, um, fast food, January, order the food, and she went in my pocket, I guess to get some money out my pocket to pay for it. And she's had some fun. Condoms came out and she was mad. So she got in the car and then boom, she crashed the car into another car that was just parked here. Boom. And she hit somebody and she hurt their arm. And then, um, the cops came and so the cops came into capsule or saying, Hey, what happened here? Right. And, um, I was afraid of they were arrest me or, and so I said, well, nothing happened, officer.

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       Um, nothing. He said the guy was, and it was the guy with a broken on my thing, you know, so why don't you just take the car, you know, you deserve it because you've been through doing a lot. Cause I didn't want to get rent, I didn't have rights as anything and I didn't want my wife to get in trouble. If you want to just take it, you know, it wasn't that it was around 230 at the time, so why don't you just take it? It'd be okay. And the guy said, hey, don't tell me that. And then once he said that, I said got him, I got him. Nothing man taking me through this man, you deserve this. Take it. And they took it out. But before that, the guy from guy arm was broken and he, I gave him my money as her take the money and then he came back to the police, my army.

Speaker 3:          00:19:19       But it kept him. Now he can get away from, I'm not going to tell you to get away from me no more because he didn't want to mess this dealer with this car. Cause the guy, he's not going to get this car. That's a little coffee. Don't fucking come near me again. That hit me. Larry Guy, he's backed off and I go, hey man, I feel it. And I took off my work. I didn't want us to get in trouble, but they made him give away the car. Right. They made it real. He could cause I went back to my office. I said, give me my fucking car back. Going to that.

Speaker 5:          00:19:43       Yeah, he got fired. He probably hearing his name. I'm going to get that back to the title. I wanted my Indian giver one of my car.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Oh No. Oh Man. Mike Tyson calls you up and says, give me my fucking car, man. Like, Shit. It's outside, man. I got to lift those. I take it. You guys know I embarked on the marijuana. Been that says it's been this way. This is this a beautiful box. Thank you so much. Awesome. Thank you Ma'am for accepted my pleasure. That's a cool ass box, man. Tight him ranch is going to be open a pretty surely. You guys have too. I saw that. I mean this is a big deal. I mean this place is gigantic state. It's, it's in California. Yeah. They're, they're setting up like a resort. Really could be the best facility in the world, man. It's going to be on it. Feel handcuff an eco long lake. Wow. Yeah, but you could go like that's going to be camping glamping like glamping. Glamorous camping.

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       Glamorous. Very glamorous. Yeah. Had some tigers and shit for some wild bill Hickman with discussing that too. Where are those times? I had him for like 14 years, so I had to get rid of or you know what I mean? What do you do when you want to get rid of a tie? A sanctuary and fucking, I got to run. I love you. I love you too, buddy. Look better cannabis dude. There it is. Yeah. Congrats on that man. That looks down. Oh often man. Fuck excited about this stuff. This is, I love him barking. Let us cannabis. They had a message, so awesome. Yeah. You, you seem to be really enjoying this when you're talking to your partners out there. You're, you're having a good time with this. Oh Man. I never thought in a million years I'd be able to do this and legalize. Yeah. When did you start like regularly smoking weed? Um, since I was like 10 years old the whole time we were fighting, you were regular smoking weed. Well, you know, when you're a kid, your mother gives you liquor and marijuana for him. He could think that you're going to go to sleep or something. Yeah. Really? Yeah. That never happened in my house. Never be. Yeah, I ain't no mother was alcoholic. That's, that's harsh liquor and marijuana. See if you go to sleep. Yeah. It didn't work. I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       Do you, uh, what, what, what benefits you get out of marijuana? Like what does it do for you? Hey Man. Um, if I didn't have a bad day, yeah. I'm really Moody Guy Without it

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       and it just smooths me out. So they'll take, I'm a whole different person. I'm really on top of my game. I'm boiling. Yeah. I feel the same way sometimes it makes me nicer. Yeah. Yeah. Calms me down. Do you, um, do you kind of like who I am when I smoke? You know what I mean? When I'm, when I weed, I don't sometime like who I am sometimes. That's just the real something. Yeah. I don't like that guy. Want to get away from that guy. Well, you know, I was talking to Michael Irvin once, he was explaining it to me that when children grow up in high stress environments that their genes are wired to, to have a propensity towards violence, that if they're normal, if it's normal, if it's around them all the time when they're, when they're growing up and when they're in the womb.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       Yeah, I agree. When their mothers under extreme stress, if they live in a bad neighborhood and it's, it's hard for some people like yourself that did grow up in an environment like that to ever reached where you're at right now. Just a place of peace. And if you can do that through marijuana or whatever it is, Yoga, meditation, whatever, whatever you do to get there, like we should be happy that you could get there. That's what we want. I am so grateful that um, I embarked on this, you know, I've never been a person to this, its magnitude at this kind of relaxation. Are you enjoying my time with you? I was very uptight. It and anytime I was with very uncomfortable with myself. Did you feel any better after you worked out when you were young like that? Absolutely. But my workout, you know what, I'm the best thing ever happened to me that we tied from Barclays because of me working out and meagan that was so intense with it. My whole, my whole objective was hurting people and one beat a Beth and my ego took over and I'm like, Tyson, I'm the best to ever live and all this bullshit. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       dealing with my partner, Rob Hickman, I happened to embark on this, um, come across this thing called the toad and he, you familiar with the toe? Yeah. Well you're talking about it's five methoxy dominance that fit right there. Yeah. And I came across that and I smoked this, um, I don't know this medicine, drug, wherever you want to call it. And, and um, I've never been the same. I look at life different. I look at people differently and um, that you experienced that can't even express really, it's almost like dying and being real reborn. Yeah. I had

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       the exact same experience. That's what it felt like to me too. Like you stop existing, the five methoxy is, uh, there's two coming with the deal with that. What the Hell's going on here? Five minutes is produced by your brain, but what it is is, uh, it's dmt with an oxygen molecule attached to it to so regular DMT is n n dimethyltryptamine and then five methoxy dimethyltryptamine dmt with like a very, there's a very subtle change to the molecule. And that subtle change for some reason takes away the visuals you've done regular dmt to, right. Yes. Regular DMT is rich with visuals. Very strained, bright, colorful, impossible. Described visuals.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       Yeah. If, um, if inconceivable, inconceivable is best with here viewable. But I tried to explain it to some people, my wife and I use, it's just, I don't have the words to explain it. That's exactly what I would say. I've done a terrible job explaining it to everybody. Every time I've tried it just doesn't work. Um, with the, all those things, they, they give you perspective almost like you're dying. You have your, your submissive, you're humble, you know what I mean? You're vulnerable, but you're invincible still in awe, you know? It's just that weird feeling, but you feel like you're part of the universe when you're, you're separate from your ego. You realize this whole thing. You're a part of this whole thing and this whole thing is unstoppable. It's just, it's a gigantic, huge, all encompassing, almost like a living thing. I know, John, this is where I also realize too, I have to go into that experience. You realize how insignificant you are sometimes without your ego. Yes. You know you made, why are you not really much that you really thought you were? Yeah, you are and you aren't.

Speaker 2:          00:26:15       Obviously you are in everyday life. I mean, you go places, you have a dramatic effect on people. You mean a lot. He mean a lot to those people that you run into. You mean a lot to the people that you love and that love you, but we all do and when the no one, Stan, no, it's all, it's all relative. No one, no one has a replaceable, but everyone is special to someone or something and at least to themselves, but we're all the same. We're all part of this weird, crazy, gigantic organism. That's the human race,

Speaker 3:          00:26:45       you know, thought that you said it. My mental cus d'amato hit objective with the think of nothing. You're nothing. Nothing is nothing but the objective, the job. And that was the psychological warfare. You know, nothing matters. You're nothing, nothing. My only thing that matters is the objective and getting to accomplishing that objective by going to these methods of boxing. Do you ever stop and think about how fortunate was you ran into that guy? Listen, till this day, I really don't understand that though. How did this happen? Because so many lives and by the time I was born, he was 66 years old by the time I was born. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:17       Crazy. So many people could,

Speaker 3:          00:27:21       you know, can't even explain it. It's a magnificent individual. He was an amazing guy,

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       amazing part of boxing and uh, uh, with uh, unprecedented grasp of the mindset required for combat sports. That was the thing that, that always really stood out about him. Like he was a guy that was so, he was so well versed in the mindset that would listen to his, his speeches, that he would talk when he would talk about you and he would talk about boxing. We talk about fear and about fear can be like a fire can cook your food, your food, or it can burn your house down and you have to, you have to control it. And when he would describe it like it would, it would be so enlightening. He was such a man of wisdom that when he would describe things, they would sink in. They would, they would, they would, somebody could say the same thing, but the w w with him, he had so much

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       life. He was so many, half of the psychiatry through the dock to the father, the mother, you know, he was just all around that individual. Yeah. And with the,

Speaker 2:          00:28:20       an amazing knowledge of boxing. And for guy like you, it was almost like it was

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       Dane. And I thought all we filled with meant for me to meet this guy because I had no way. In a million years. Everybody say, no way. You're gonna be champion too small. Yeah. The two, sure. No Way. These guys are too big for you. He says this is the greatest fight ever lived. This and that. The only thing is about me, I'm like, Oh God, this guy's just swooped me up. I never thought I could achieve what he was saying and things he was saying was just so, um, gigantic in my eye that, yeah. Yeah. I mean

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       when it all happened and it turned out that he was true and you have to absorb all this when you're 20 years old, you know, it's, I always say this about Justin Bieber and I don't think Justin bieber nearly had to deal with what you had to deal with your, your experience with so much crazier because you were not just an incredibly famous guy. You were the baddest man on the planet. So there was like an aura to you. Everywhere you went, people wanted to see you. You know, 50 year old men don't give a fuck about Justin bieber. You know, no disrespect. He's a great guy, a great singer, but it's not. He's like young girls for young girls like guys, unbelievably famous, but he's, he's been famous since he was a little kid. I'm like, how when people hear about them going right? Amazing. When people hear about him going insane, I'm like, of course he's going insane. You have no idea what it would be like to be him. It'll be 17 years old and girls literally trying to break into his house to throw a pussy. Adam did coming

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       down. Chimneys, they're flying in on parishes are doing anything they can. They just want to be around them and you want him to be normal. Poor guy. No one can handle that. What kind of music you're listening to? I listen to everything that I do. I listen to. I was in a lot of classic rock for whatever reason. But uh, I've been listening to a lot of Kanye West over the last few weeks. Tell me what he talking about. Kanye. Yeah, well he's talking about a lot of crazy shit he's taught. He actually talked about dmt in one of his recent songs. Think he did that before. I think he did. Oh Man. Well I know he's friends with kid cuddie kid cut. He'd been in here and kid cut. He's had some psychedelic experiences. Yeah. Once you go to is just, um, you didn't want to do nothing else again.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       Well, it puts it all in the perspective. It lets you see that, uh, as much as this thing seems to be important is all temporary and you're a part of forever and it also allows you to become comfortable with death. Yeah. Yeah. You know who said that? Larry Hagman remember that Guy Dallas Jr Salad? He did an interview with CNN and I dream of Jeannie as well. Yeah, that's right. He sprung it on him on CNN. Once he was talking about how he did acid, he took a big dose acid and he's never worried about death ever again. That it just alleviated his, his worry about passing on as, wow. This if that could, I felt the same way. I feel I haven't doesn't matter anymore. Yeah. I think dnt even more specifically because they think, yeah, what that does fake the mine that way. What causes the effect of mine that way they don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       They didn't mean Gig visioning, visualize everything. Um, they don't totally know. They know that your brain makes it. They know that your body makes it, they should say and they know that it's produced in your liver and their lungs and there's some evidence now cause they found it in rats, that the pineal gland produces it, which is like, that's the third eye of eastern mysticism that Glenn actually in rats, they've proven produces dmt and they think it does so on people too. You know, once I did, I wanted to do it again and again and again. And if they shouldn't do too much, my wife with me, I got to, you know, grasp what's going on here. Why am I feeling, it's like why? Why did this in a weird way, like humbled you? I don't think you should listen to the people say you shouldn't, you know too much.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       I think you should do it as much as you want. I thought I agree with too. Yeah, I agree. You could handle it. If you can handle being like Tyson, you can handle doing dmt issues, emt. Yeah, that's what I think I'm going, I'm like, I'm going in that direction. Well, I mean it's not something you just do all day everyday, but you can learn a lot from it. It's the, and it's, it's very beneficial and very strange that it's illegal. You know that it's illegal. Yeah. Notice that Terence Mckenna had a joke about it because your body's making it so everybody's holding, we all have it. You know, it's illegal, but it's like making blooded legal. Everybody has. And then why would he go to scenario deadly when they find these tolls? Yeah. Yeah. I've never experienced it from the toad of owning a television where the way they extracted grab them and they buses

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       pimples and the busing on the class a marrow and then take it off and he let it harden.

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       Yeah. Yeah. They, they let it dry in the summer, scrape it off with the razor blade. I've only had it synthetically made in a laboratory. You smelled a buy it online. Used to be able to buy like a fucking can of it, like this big enough to get like a whole state high.

Speaker 3:          00:32:59       She's just buy it online. It was totally legal. Credible. Yeah. It's weird. It's bizarre. That is illegal. Well, they would say not for human consumption and, but I don't know. What the fuck are you doing with it if you're not using it for human consumption, but you, you used to be able to buy it. I've never felt anything like that before. No. Nothing like that makes me not want to do anything. Nothing else can supersede that. How long ago did it happen? I don't know. Around two months ago. Yeah. Did you write down what happened after it happened or did you record it? No, I will shut that. Yeah, we should that. Yeah, me too. If you'd like, it goes away like a dream. Right. And comes off, you know, you're, you're so scared. You know stuff, stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          00:33:37       Like, no, no, no. Hey, I want this to stop now. And the guy was like, hey, you're on the ride. And I'm like, no, no, no. I love it. I love you. I love you. I love you.

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       Yeah. I love everybody. Yeah, so spassed out. Yeah. Did you have a hard time letting go at the beginning of fighting me? I don't think stop wanting to stop now. Just jump. Stop the shit now. Stopping. The guy was like, hey, the show. I'm like, I can do it. Got to go for the ride, dude. And it was like, whoa man. Fuck, I'm dying. Things are going in my film theme, the Aztec things. I'm being told I'm going to seeing weird animal. The thing that you're flying, it's just, it's like another chamber. It's boom flashing food and he'd gone to take a rocker. You taking off foom. Yeah. It's beyond your imagination. Yeah. DEF is inconceivable. Can't even explain it to no one. Well, I'm hoping

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       that they, they start with psilocybin because a, I know maps there. They're doing some great work with that. Trying to get these things legalize especially they're doing mtma studies with veterans and people with Ptsd and they're having great results. They're moving in the civil side bend. They would love to get silicide been legal and it's up for ballot. I think it was in Oregon. Is that where it is? It's up for, I think Oregon is up for legalization this year and it may be eventually in California as well. They may hate him. Go do it. It should be legal. It doesn't kill anybody. It should be, it's not a bad thing if they regulate it, if they make it for therapeutic use and just set up centers where experts can show, but they shouldn't make it prohibitive for people to own it or even grow their own.

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       It's not a bad idea to set up places where people can do it. Under a professionals care, a showman's care. Physicians Care, that's a good idea, but making it illegal is a bad idea because it helps a lot of people, you know, people think of it as a party drug. They think you're going to do mushrooms and freak out and go fucking run around naked and La was do mushrooms. I love mushrooms. Yeah, well psilocybin and DMT or very closely related chemically. All those really potent psychedelic drugs are very closely related. They all break down in, in some similar path inside your brain and, and give you

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       that, that weird ego dissolving experience. Yeah. That's one thing. Most of the drugs you do it, most of them. Um, Eagle enhancing, right? Like coke. Yeah. He likes some of the baddest mother and he had gone and yeah. You know, you've never had coffee. I've never had coke. Never, never. Oh Man. No. You didn't miss out as nothing, man.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       Yeah. That one I ducked when I was in high school. My friend's cousin used to sell it and he, he, he wasted away to nothing. Knew him and his girlfriend would hang out in the attic and never come out. They would just sell coke and watch TV. It was bad. Like it was like a vampire bit him.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       Aw Man. He came up once you get in that kind of vicious cycle. It's a wrap. Yeah. Yeah. So I ducked it. Adopted early, never did coke man was the first time he did coke. I Dunno, it was kid 11, 12. I got involved with drug early in life. Wow. That's crazy. Uh, 1112. Yeah. I was still living in Brownsville, Brooklyn when I first did cocaine. Wow. That's a crazy, listen, I would never let my children have a 10 year old daughter and eight year olds. I would never let them look. The life that I live, I will hate thousand away fight for her to live with and be in an environment that I grew up in. Yeah, of course. Well, you know, you have the benefit of having gone through it. You know? No one else could ever understand how, how, how difficult any of your life must've been for you.

Speaker 2:          00:37:37       It's gotta be one of the harder things when, when you did that documentary to amazing documentary, when you're very honest, you're very honest and you're very open about all your experiences. And the one thing I took away after that, like no one can understand. You could, you could hear a guy talk like this. I could hear you say these things. I could see the videos of your fights to see the videos, your experience, but to understand the life that you lived, it's impossible to, it's just a guess. It's like a guest. For someone like me from the outside,

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       it's just really interested in it. Look, I think about this young kid, Brooklyn, and you come to the cuff though tomorrow at 1312 you know, and I'll something all of a sudden have a low self esteem. This guy gives me this big fucking ego, you know what I mean? I live by the, you know, I live by the rules of that ego and that's, and I have accomplished so much in a dominator ego. Yeah, you're, you're, you're, you're set. Oh, about destroying people. Yeah. Just anybody. It could be a lawyer, 200 pounds. I'm staring you down. It's just weird environment up that way,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       you know, cause we have people, we try to avoid fights, you know what I mean? Right. From my instincts, we avoid fights for all our lives and just to be able to see what you do. Like you UFC guy, you're a fighter. This is what you do for a job, a lifestyle. That's pretty bizarre. You were getting positive reinforcement from thinking like that for the first time in your life. Absolutely. Yeah. I never felt like that before. We like taking up a big drug. Elution has boomi. It felt like get a man and then everybody's telling you you're great. Yeah. You know, for the first time in your life, never understood that. And you know what else customer I used to do with me, he used to take me to a hypnotist. He was the hitting detention as well. Yeah. They used to go in the hypnotist motions.

Speaker 3:          00:39:16       What kind of Shit did they make you? Do you know how they do it? Yes. You relax, you go under, you totally focus on blackness. Nothing that's right. And you go under and yes, being savage, intelligent avenue. Animal, yes. Work. And you're going to do this. You're going to be a ferocious animal. You're going to fight, puff, put both hands to the body, your these, your jab, you to do this and ferocious fashion. And they picked all that in me. If I was younger and you were like 1213 years old. Wow. So they're putting you under and just teaching you that mindset. Yeah. Whoa. Did he give you any advice on how to shut it off? No.

Speaker 5:          00:39:53       He's probably like, I don't have any time. Let me time. The kid is 13. How old is because there's no time, no time. I'm not going to teach them the off switch. Just hit the gas.

Speaker 3:          00:40:06       Therefore the word, the gas destroyed, he's got, he's got in our way of, you know what I mean? Greatness. Glory.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       It's one of the hardest things that many fighters I've, that I've watched over the years have the problem of shutting it off. Like turning it on and living like that and just wanting to be a dominator. But then learning how to be a father. Learning how to be

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       man, my friend and my first lifetime with children and stuff, trying to do this stuff. Man, I feel filled. The disasters, they, you know, it's just, um, I had no idea what I was doing too. I had no idea what it was, what arena was stepping into. It was just, it was just a disaster. I find out, uh, I spend most of my adult life now I'm apologizing to my kids. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I can imagine me a horrible father.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       Do you think they understand the shit that you were going through? They understand. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       I have no idea. No. I don't know. I tried to basically make sure that part of my life is empty now. The different life for my kids and family now. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       Well that's beautiful. It's beautiful that you, you, you, like Tom was saying earlier, you have a lot of self reflection. You've, you've managed to look at your life and, and find out what's, what has value to you and what helps you.

Speaker 3:          00:41:21       You always have to do self evaluation. I mean, it's a strong believer in that if somebody has to check you, you have to check yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:41:28       I agree. Yeah. Well, especially a guy like you who's, you know, you're, you've been checked, your ego's checked, your life

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       has been checked if it's so many down moments as well as up moments. You've had the, the full ride of experiences. Never with Avaya with my ego being chicken and no idea that that wasn't what it was about. So you thought if your ego checked, you would go and be nothing when I, my ego. Wow. Yeah. Well, I mean it makes sense when you're going through all that hypnosis when you're 12 and 13 years old. But that's a crazy thing to do to a kid because it was sand. No idea. But I wanted to do it so bad. I wouldn't succeed so bad. You could tell, you know, I watched a video of you a real recently, you were about 16, 16, 17 years old and you were sparring with some big guy who was a professional heavyweight and you were, uh, it was what was fascinating to me about, it wasn't just watching move around when you were young and still learning, but it was also, you were upset at yourself after it was over.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       You didn't think it went well. And, and I was like, Oh, remember that? You don't remember. It was, it was an interesting video, man. You were like, I didn't go well, I could tell it didn't go well. I was a thick perfectionists. That's what I was going to say and it seemed like it like you were obsessed as my whole life. That's all I did was look at Bucklin Watch Bach, the read about fighters and it was all about fighting the fight of the, my God, Fido, you know that kind of stuff. Fight after I want to be around them and be their groupie. That's another amazing imagine that you also knew Jim Jacobs and that's fucking fight library. That's watched films up to El hazing. This is pre vhs, right. Beat people at Vhs, but not many and there's fight. Those fights were not vhs away mentally for like if you didn't, if you missed the fight, you weren't going to see it again.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       Right? Yeah. Paypal and Jim Jacobs, he kept those things on like a regular old projector type thing. If you listen to the voiceover on some of those old fights, it's Jim Jacobs. Yeah, it's him doing commentary on some of the old fights. It didn't have any phones study. All these guys all day and all night. You study though. Yeah. He was through you. That I learned about a lot of fighters when you were talking about Jack Dempsey and talk about different fighters from the old days. I learned about a lot of those guys from you and went back and watched some of those tapes and now it's beautiful. Now you can just get on youtube and you see whatever you want to see everything, see all of it. But to go back and watch my was away from my office in precedent. If you're going to feed this. Yeah, they shout exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       I can't wait. I want you to come by. Um, cause we ran two and the ranch's I'm in, um, productive. It's going to be off. So you said 2022? Yeah. So, uh, four year. What does it, yeah, four years from now, three years from now. We pretty awesome. Yeah. That's awesome. Well, the plans look amazing. You know how long you guys been working towards this a, listen, we have seen the property and then um, we purchased it and we were just, um, we were just overwhelmed with this. It's probably what? I don't know. Maybe a year ago, maybe even that. Maybe, maybe a year or so. You didn't have, are you going to have a gym up there? Hey, I never thought it, but we will have because we don't have the wellness center. Yeah, Dude. How great would it be if you taught like a boxing class? I know about that stuff though. We got to hang out there and work out. Just a fun box in class, like hitting the heavy bag. Just something fun. You don't have to get people beating each other up. Do you know how much people would pay to smoke weed and come where had a box from you smoke weed.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       Do you smoke weed with people? Just regular folks. Yeah, it's, look we, yeah. I was trying to get my wife to smoke with me. No, she doesn't smoke. She smoked only at nighttime. She can't function during the daytime. Oh, right, right. During the day. Well, I would imagine if I was a mother it would be very hard to get high because I get paranoid. You know? I'd be a lot fun. She doesn't do it during the day. At night.

Speaker 2:          00:45:07       It's different. Smoke, a little weed, relaxed. How did you ever do any fighting? I did kickboxing and how many tournaments? I was, uh, I was pretty good at taekwondo. I won a bunch of state championships and won a few national.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       What did he do? You know, you wanted to get physical in another human being and do this stuff. Can, you know, you can't be in the right frame of mind and want to do this stuff. Got To realize that I was this stuff and not in the right frame of mind and half dealing with fear drives you insane. Deal with that. Drives people insane. I was insane during my career. Yes. Madly and staying from fear. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       Obviously I never went through anything like the level that you went through, but for these full contact taekwondo fights, I was always scared and uh, but I was scared before that I was bullied. I moved around a lot. I was a little kid. I was never very big and we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco when I was seven, from San Francisco to Florida. When I was 11 Florida to Boston when I was 14 or 13 so it's just always moving a new schools always deal with new kids and I wasn't big and I didn't know how to fight and I got picked on and I didn't like it. So I said, I wanna I want to figure out how to fight. And so I started getting into martial arts and I just became obsessed with it. I did it every day. I started teaching. I was teaching at Boston University is teaching a taekwondo course.

Speaker 2:          00:46:24       When I was 19 I was competing from the time I was 15 I just threw myself into it. It's all I did every day I worked at the school. I was there every day. I had the keys, I closed up, I opened up where I am because of you, because of hearing about you. When you were running in the morning, when you knew that everybody else was asleep, that gave you an edge. I go there in the middle of the night and open up and work out. I just wanted to just have an edge, you know? And I've listened to what you said and I said, that's a great way to have an edge. I became obsessed with it, but there was no future in it. And then what happened was I went from taekwondo to kickboxing and when I started kickboxing, I started getting fucked up. Do's are beating the shit out of me because I was realizing like I can't keep people at the same distance anymore cause I didn't know how to use my hands properly. Like I knew how to throw some punches a little bit from taekwondo, but it's not nearly sophisticated as boxing or kickboxing. And so then I started kickboxing training and then I started realizing like there's no future in it. It's like, what am I doing? I'm just getting my brains beat in, you know, and I'm hard sparring. Two of the sparring was rough. It was Boston style. Put the gloves on and beat the shit out of each other. Figure it out as you

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       yeah. Ain't going shit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:31       So a lot of headaches and you know, but it was, um, it was hard for me to, to shut that part of me off the part of me, they just wanted to conquer the part of me just wanting to win all the time to figure out a way to be more intense, more driven, more focused. But when I did stop fighting, it was a huge relief. Like the relief part was worth the extra anxiety that I got. It was worth it just for the relief of not, not thinking about fighting all the time, not thinking about when's the next tournament, when's the next event? When's the next thing I'm doing? It was just, wait. Well, for you it had to be way crazy because not only is it the weight, it's the heavyweight championship of the world. I always wanted to make my mentor happy. Yeah. That was my goal, to make him happy when he died. Was it weird not having a person like that?

Speaker 3:          00:48:20       My, and it was so, man, it was just emptiness. It was just, and then people who we go with our friends and that we say we're going to be good too. They started when he died, they started going in for the kill. You just want to grab me for means.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Well it seemed like you and Kevin Rooney had a good combination at the beginning when he died, when, when customers,

Speaker 3:          00:48:41       we didn't know what we're going to do. They're thinking about getting rid of Kevin and said, and I was saying I didn't want to be with nobody else. I was comfortable with Kevin and the style and the way we were going. I didn't want to be in oil. So I said, no, let's just keep Kevin.

Speaker 2:          00:48:52       Yeah. And Kevin was a great training for me. Very well respected trainer. Yeah. It was a good relationship. Like the way it worked in the beginning it looked like, but then like all things, you know, Kevin used to train me and then fighting our finances and to call it. Oh really? Yeah. Wow. Wow. And this was all like, was he training you um, before, before cus died as well? Well, yeah. How many, how many years before Christ died? Was he like holding mitts for you and if the couple, but he knew you well? Yes. Did He, well, did he watch fights with you as well? Did you or were you watching

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       watch a fight? The monthly arm started training with each other. We started watching fights together

Speaker 2:          00:49:37       because you're stuck. That was the other thing to your style. The way you would come out was so reminiscent of old fighters and when you come out and no socks on black shoes.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       Wow. That would think in my, my mind. I think it was a lot about gladiator and via telephone and how another thing now look at enough to look at I philly little philly kid. Thank you. Tough. I would think. I just can't thank you

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       where you were tough man. I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying. But you were when you fought Marvis Fraser on what does the ABC, maybe she had fight. I remember watching that fight going, Holy Shit. Holy Shit. It was like being locked into a ring with a tornado. That was wild day. Yeah. That was a tough kid. That was your peak. That was when it was peak. Scary. You know, you were coming up and everybody was just terrified. It was just a wild thing to watch man. To be a part it to be you.

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       Yeah. One of the, uh, make my mentor happy though as my main goal and fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       It's a powerful goal. Yeah. Did you ever try to go back and get hypnotized after all that's over the try to maybe calm down. That part of your mind

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       turned 'em I never did. I had to do the toll, I think helped me out the total. Yeah, it definitely, that stuff will help me out. Did we'd help you out at all? I'm pretty much, yeah. You know what I mean? But I had to do it every day. I had to do it all the time. It all the time then yeah. If I went to another country and I didn't have my weed up at insane, they what? No. We're going to be here a couple of days a week. A month. Get the hell out of here.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       Yeah. Yeah. The rest of the world will catch up eventually. They'll catch up eventually. It's slowly happening. We were talking about it before the show started that just a few years ago, if you smoked weed you, you felt like you were a criminal. Like you have to hide those. I look around, you look around. Who's got a cop still like that in New York? I was in New York recently and we had a hyde weed. That's crazy there. I'm like, how is this New York City and antiquated, so stupid. Just doesn't make any sense. Especially when like we're both high right now then man, the kite, it's fine. Everything's good. Having a nice conversation. I totally agree. How many fights did Jim Jacobs have in that library?

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       Oh, no. Thousands of man. I watch thousand guy fighting an 1890 eighth west. The mall.

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       Wow. Who were standouts for you outside of the standard, like obviously Jack Johnson.

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       Yeah, he was awesome too. Um, he was just amazing. He was ahead of his time fighting it. Some little guys like Tony, Kevin and Arie Hamdi, Armstrong Barney Ross guy. It's like that Benny Leonard, this guy that just, they evolve buckling through the level where it can evolve too. Now they became, they were superstars in that time. Who's that crazy middleweight who went up to fight Jack Johnson and Charles Stanley Catcho. That's right. He's a bad ad punch. Yeah. He's a bad ass. Then he got killed. Yeah. I ain't got time. Yeah. Cause cause he stole this guy's girlfriend and he was a tough guy. Like what are you going to do about if Pete, the guy, he'll be disrespected the guy and the guy came back and shot him standing kitchen with a real wild and crazy guy.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Well most of the greats were. Yeah, he was wild. That's a new feel it then pay anyone. But when you talk about like your life and like the way you were living, if you go back to most of the greats, like Roberto Duran, he was a wild mother fucker. Beautiful. It was beautiful with that rhythm with it. Yeah. There's so many of the greats were just wild, wild people. You know? I think that that fear that is pretty that out of you. Yeah. But then there was some grades that were just real disciplined, like struggling. Marvin Hagler is my best example for that. When I was a kid growing up in Boston, Hagler was the middle weight champion of the world, and I used to see, they used to have video of him running. They played it on the news. He was running on the, there was the dunes sand dunes and Cape Cod in the winter, freezing cold with a Hoodie on, running, screaming war.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       Whoa. Oh, it was amazing. Marvin Hagler made you want to just get out of your house and go running in the snow. You know, he was so disciplined. That was the thing that I always got out of watching him, wasn't that he was so wild. He was so mentally strong. He had an iron chin and his discipline was an impeccable, his deeds. He was just constantly training. Never add a shape, never got fat. Always doing sit ups and push ups. Some ferocious animal. They through the body. Yeah. Oh, he was chiseled. He was a machine that fight with Tommy hearns. Um, that was one of the greatest middleweight and counters of all time chaos. I mean it's, we didn't know what was going to stop the fight. The fight and Tommy hearing through, they'll be, the winner is skillful. As they were, they decided to just smash, just get into the center and fucking foot. There was no like Tommy hearns control to try to use his jab box in the house. Are you going to keep it? You're not going to keep them for your dog.

Speaker 3:          00:54:22       Try to take them out of the film with crazy. You can't back from like they, you know, sugar ray Leonard did that. They don't have, they weren't at their prime then. Yeah. I wanted to see those two guys in their prime is go at it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Yeah. Sugar Ray Leonard. When especially when he fought Hagel, he fought hygge or smart stay the fuck away. I heard the craziest rumor. Tell me if this is the craziest rumor that Marvin Hagler like decided to bet on himself for that fight. Didn't knew that he was going to lose. Like they had it set up and then retired and went to Italy

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       as a ridiculous rumor. Right. And know what anybody did. But on the, I never heard anything like that. You never heard that one? No,

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       but he's the more, one of the most interesting end of careers.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       I heard a rumor that he didn't fight the fight, that he should have fight that and he should have fought. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:55:10       Well, the rumor was he went to Italy because the mob said everything. Yeah. Something to that effect. He went to Italy and became a giant movie star, but he's the only guy that I can think of in recent memory that literally went out on top, had unbelievably close fight with sugar ray Leonard, who a lot of people think he could have won that fight. Very close decision and then says, that's it. See Ya, I'm done. Everybody comes back. Come back.

Speaker 3:          00:55:35       Yeah. I guess I'm at one time. That's your whole life. I would think of my, I'm for prior then never came back. That was just my whole life. That was my whole identity. Yeah. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:55:46       But when you did retire and when you retired in the ring, that was the most honest retirement speech I've ever heard of box give ever. He's just like, I don't, I don't have this in medium

Speaker 3:          00:55:55       and once with him in the air anymore, this is, um, I looked pretty bizarre for myself even, Ya know, cause this is what I base my life on doing when I first started doing it. If I'm a dedicate my life to this stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:56:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       He gets to see that it's not even, I'm no longer happened was pretty weird.

Speaker 2:          00:56:10       When did you know that you didn't want to do it anymore? I'm known years before that, but I was still being very successful. Yeah. Like when like what year? Like do you remember around when you started thinking it?

Speaker 6:          00:56:20       I don't remember. Probably man,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       what? The 2000 area. So by the time that that's post holyfield yeah, after, yeah. Then you just get it done too much. I was just winning them. You see winning beating guys, you know, guys get hit with something and from to be feel scared. Yeah. What did, what did you have in mind? Like that's the hardest thing, right? To to swing from that to the next thing. Like how do you take, how do you take this crazy exciting life? Oh No, I thought I lifted. Let me if get high for a while and figured it out. That was the plan. Yeah. Let me party for a while to figure this stuff out. What did you figure out? Um, uh, I wanted to do other things. So I started, my wife arranged for me to be the death being on stage that she created the Maya.

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       Yeah, that's a brilliant idea because you're also the first fighter that ever did that. Cause many fighters have great stories, but very few of them we've ever, I don't think anybody besides you, it was ever put into it. And we went all over the ct do that man. It's just amazing. We did in Monaco, we didn't own, we did it, um, uh, uh, amount of various places. And now my eighth can't believe that people want to see this though. Well, like I said, the documentary was amazing. So people want to hear the live version of you talking about it and to see you live in person. Cause the first time we did it, the first time we did it, I'm on Broadway dated, right. We were really sure about how it's gonna turn out. So we invited all of our friends. We had taken the, gave all to our friends and people we love like names and we pulled them to the show.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       And so when we started they started laughing. But if I left, I ran in my right wife, I ran, I still got the baby. What's going on and listening. Okay. Can you I, I didn't want the show to be a comedy. It turned out to be a common with hard, gritty show about a tough guy. Right. I made it through his toughness and he just came up on me. It's talking about myself, how much his stomach I am, you know, and they loved it. Well, I think that was part of it is cause like they all, everybody knew you were this tough guy, but they didn't know that you can be so self deprecating and have so much fun with it all. You know? That's what people loved it because yeah, they're doing the writing for my, my moving and stuff. I haven't seen it anywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       That's going to be pretty wild. Who's playing you in a movie? I don't know various people, but you know most likely when Jv Brown and Jamie, Jamie Foxx to do it, he could do it. He can do anything. He could do anything, anything. That guy could be the fucking president of United States. He could be a pilot that goes to the moon. He could do whatever the fuck you want. I want him to do it. Yeah. He could do whatever he wants. He'll probably bulk up like crazy too to do it. It's going to be really, wow. Yeah. Jamie could pull it off. Michael Jai white pulled it off. Michael Jai white and do it like Jamie. I Dunno. I thought it didn't do a bag. A lot of people didn't like what he did, but I thought he did a good job. You did a good job. He, I loved him and spawn. He's a great guy. Do you know him well? No.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       He's a great guy. Great Guy. Very smart guy. Very humble guy. Really, really intelligent and a great martial artist too. Michael Jai White. There's a kill Kachin a karate black belt is bad. The fight, the fight in the UFC now when he was fighting, there was no ufc around, but he did a lot of karate tournaments and stuff is very good. I've watched him train before. He's legit. Very legit. But like I said, real, real good guy. But yeah, I agree. Jamie Foxx, man. Jamie Foxx is on another planet. He's just got this level of competence and skill and artistry in his singing and his comedy and his acting. He could do anything. He could play you. He's going to hang out with you for awhile. I don't know what he's, it's gotta. It's gotta hang out with you food pretty often. He's got to hang out with you got to absorb it, right? Yeah. To see what, how that without, are you going to be good kids consultant? You're going to be like pitch. I would have never said that. I would like to say that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       But for some reason they get them. They have the Hollywood wave of doing thing. Yeah. You know what I mean? They make it come out of Hollywood ish gift. Yeah. Cause some thing that I'm, it's this, this is really wild. How did they tried to switch it to appear? Um, cause Annabelle, right? Yeah. They tried to change the story and no one else I realized too when Hollywood perspective from things, the religious is just still unbelievable. Yeah. So yeah. So there really is unbelievable. Yeah. Well do you know that movie Fox Catcher? Did you know that movie? They had a roughly movie, I remember that story of the young guy. I remember that. Yeah. That Guy Mark Schultz. It was Dave Schultz in March lesson. Dave Schultz who got murdered. Mark Schultz is the guy who fought in the UFC. Here's what's crazy about that movie. I don't know how much of that movie's accurate.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       I don't know. I wasn't there, but what I do know is the one thing that I for sure know happened, they changed when he fought in the UFC. Mark only fought in UFC wants. He fought a guy named big daddy goodrich. Gary big, big black guy were karate, gi and then eventually got rid of the gay later in his career, but he's a legend. Big Daddy's. Imagine you didn't have it in the movie. It's not big daddy and the movie's fighting some white guy. It doesn't make any sense. They just, they changed who he's fighting for. No reason. It's a historical event. It's like if you, for whatever reason, they decided to not have you fight Trevor Berbick you fought someone else like you fought Gerry Cooney for the title. It's not going to be crazy. They were like, why would you change history? Like I hope they don't do nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       I'm not going to win. I can't want to do that. They do something like that. That has to be, they did it with the UFC and when they did it with foxcatcher can be by, but it doesn't make it any better. That's what's crazy. It doesn't make the movie any better to have him fight a Russian guy. It doesn't make him a bed. If I could be known right in the UFC, especially for people like me that are in the audience and go, oh look, look who's playing big daddy high. They do a big daddy, big daddy. He's tough. He took big daddy down at where they do whatever you want it to him. He's Mark Schultz who was a fucker of a wrestler. I mean him and his brother was savages. They were savages. They were just made out a down

Speaker 3:          01:02:26       the deal with they guy. How did they hook up with that guy? What did, he was really daily

Speaker 2:          01:02:30       rich and there's no money in amateur wrestling and these guys, a lot of them were really struggling when they're trying to make the Olympics team, I mean they're, they're getting by barely. They barely have enough money for healthy food and they need sponsors and sometimes it gets sponsors, like a rich guy who owns a business or you know, he loves the Olympics, he loves wrestling. Maybe he wrestled in college and he'll take care of them. Get maybe get them some vitamins, maybe sponsoring with the Indian, you know, they have various people that help them with their training and their food. But this guy came along and said, look, I'm going to build a gigantic facility to create the best wrestling program and pay you guys all money to come and train here. And they couldn't help it. It's like they were poor. They didn't know what to do, but I understand that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       Yeah. And he was a guy who is like a trust fund guy. He got all his money from his family and he was just some crazy rich asshole and he wound up shooting one of them. Yeah, I mean that's what it is. I mean, the store, like you said, the story itself is fucking crazy enough. The actual store, they didn't have to change anything of it. So I know they changed that part of it. So who knows what else in the movie the added or changed or fucked with. They fucked with something they didn't have to fuck with. They went Hollywood with it in a way that they didn't have to do. So it makes you, you question all the other things that happened in the movie and it's pretty, so for you they can't, you can't do that. Your life was crazy

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       in thing. I'm no way I was saying I'm with, okay, I really, I really want to do this stuff, man. I really want to go on the screen with my life and be fulfilled. These people, I think that really need that. I, you know, I'm thinking about that recently. They're really neat though and um, candidate has been, this is getting ready to pop off and do really well. I'm thinking, I really, I don't really, they're really needs this money that hurt you.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       It's not going to hurt you. It's going to help you. Anything helps you at this point. You're so honest that anything that you've done in the past that you're embarrassed about or shameful of, it just makes, it's just better. It's just better for you. It's like you made mistakes is people can learn from them. These are beneficial. So watching someone like you talk about your life is beneficial for people because you learn how you can overcome these experiences. How, how bad things can be for you. You learn how bad you can fuck up and people need to see shit like that. It's good for, it's good for civilizations, good for our culture. I think so at plastic guy like you who was like I said when I was a kid, you're the fucking man. I mean you were the fucking man to have a guy like you be self deprecating explaining and laughing about things.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       It makes it even, it sinks in more. It's like you were saying, we were saying about custom model that his wisdom, it's sunk in like he was the gravel in his voice and the intensity in his eyes and the wisdom in his words, it's sunk in. I remembered his quotes for years afterwards because he lived so much because he had so much, and that's the same thing with you man. When you, when you were talking about your life experiences, like people listen, they take it in because they know you lived an extraordinary life, so they better not fuck this movie out and it really extreme. It's extreme as it gets. What's Mark Stream other than a soldier and those are the only people that live a more extreme life first responder soldiers, firemen, police officers. Yeah. That's it. I mean they, they're seeing death and violence every day. Other than them. You probably lived the most extreme life ever. Who the fuck can relate to you? Do you ever get together with other like worldclass pro boxers that have

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       no, but the guy that do get it and took it, the guy who talked about the veteran, the, yeah. Maybe telling me with the, you know, oh man. Yeah. Talked to seals about their time deployed, so probably they don't take themselves out of that. Those guys. Yeah. Thanks. Well a lot of those guys are finding some relief in the same things that you found it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:10       Family farm or leave and, and DMT and other psychedelics, mushrooms. I think that that could be a great benefit to a lot of our veterans.

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       I believe that 100% too. I don't know why they don't want to dabble in this stuff. Yeah. What do you think would have happened to you if you got ahold of that stuff? While you were in your prime. I don't know. I don't think maybe I want to be a fighter then. Yeah. Maybe I won't want to be a fighter. Damn. D tmt might have derailed it. Yeah. I might want to love everybody. Definitely make you feel it when you come out of it. You got love for you. Yeah, buddy. Yeah. Well

Speaker 2:          01:06:47       my hope is that uh, with great organizations like maps, um, that one day people will be able to see things like everybody would be able to see things the way you do and then we'll all have this understanding what these things are there. They're tools that can help us all these things including marijuana. It's a tool to help us. You going to use any tool you can abuse. Any tool there is, you can take a hammer and hit yourself in the head. If you're stupid, you could abuse anything, but you could also use it in a, in a make, build yourself a beautiful house. And with cannabis you can, you could use it to make it makes you a nicer version. Does makes you more, I've felt more vulnerable. Have more of a sense of community. I'm always hugging people when I'm high. I want to hug everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:07:28       You know, I agree. It's a better feeling. You know what I mean? It makes you, it makes you feel kind. I agree. I like feeling. Okay. What is it like for you to, uh, to watch boxing these days?

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       Isn't that in my life anymore? You don't watch it at all? It did you watch Tyson fury? Deontay wilder. I was in the air flying when they were fighting. Oh really? Did you didn't watch it? The highlights or anything for some of the highlights? Yeah. How crazy is deontay? Wilder is power. Good stuff. Crazy rights. Cause he's built so strange. It's totally how incredible. How incredible of titans. Chore. Incredible. Incredible. And gets up and wins the rest of the round. That's what's really incredible. It's amazing. Amazing fight. Yeah. So you don't follow, you don't follow any of the tail with, um, you know, that's part of my life. Um, I'm, um, I've got mixed feelings with that part of my life. Right. And I stuffed up there. I don't like about myself and stuff. That is right. I tried to forget that stuff cause I'm on a whole different. Um, if I hadn't. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       So even watching other people by,

Speaker 1:          01:08:35       I don't even what to, nothing. I tried to stay away much as possible.

Speaker 2:          01:08:38       So watching other people box makes you think about yourself when you were fighting reminds you of it kind of. Yeah. Yeah. I would say these guys are so much Nathan and I was, you know what I mean? I'd be the cool guy. Yeah. Right. Like who, who, yeah. There's no one out here today that's got that mean, vicious persona and Nice Guy. Yeah. You, when you were in the ring doing a post fight interview saying you want to eat your children, you want to eat someone's children. I remember saying that. This is the craziest fucking post fight interview. It was. It was about Lennox Lewis, right? Yeah. If I'm mad, maybe one of the great, what's wrong with me? I'm just a madman. It was amazing. It was amazing for, for the story, for the time. I mean, look what it was was when we saw rocky three, right. And Mr t was, it was challenging, you know, a rocky and he would say all that crazy shit about what he was going to do. My prediction pain. No. Beautiful. It's beautiful. What you did is you took that and just cranked it up to 11 and threw gasoline on it and lit it on fire. You just took that kind of ferocious shit.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       Yeah. I look at some of those prep conference in a long time. I'm what? I'm faintly talk to anybody like that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       That's a different world now. My world feels different now. Do you feel when you watched that stuff that you feel almost like trapped by that past like that you have to acknowledge it. You don't even acknowledge it anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       Yeah. For that, I'm almost a little bit like, I don't want to be involved. We stayed. Never happened. Yeah. Yeah. But kind of had to happen for you to be who you are. They'll know it because people, this is the real reason that [inaudible] people, stihl people left that guy. Yeah. Yeah. And then people would love that. I didn't like that guy that much. So I have my own conflicting with people that like that guy and me living my life that I am living now. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:19       Well people love that guy because that guy gave them a drug and that drug was excitement. Like you turn on the TV like, Oh shit, here we go, Michael Spanx, Mike Tyson. Here we go. And boom. Oh, that's what people wanted. They wanted that excitement. They knew some crazy shit was about to go down. Unpredictable. You can't, you don't. No one knows it's going to happen at a fight. Is it going to be a right or a left? Is he going to move right is you're gonna move left. How's it going to work out? You don't know how long could spank slas. You don't know. And everybody was excited and that was, that's what you brought people. You brought people this, this chaotic moment. You slapped down the money and the paper views. You've got at your popcorn and you waited for the dirt rush. The rush of excitement of the crazy days. Crazy days.

Speaker 1:          01:11:00       Okay then.

Speaker 2:          01:11:01       I hate to keep bringing your head back to that, but just for me as a kid growing up during that time, it was a big part of my, you know, my becoming an adult. It was during your era, you're

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       ever of dominance. How we'd look at my kids and I think, why did you guys, uh, pretty much, um, um, middle class kid, they live their life to do what they wanted to go to college and everything. I W I w I would never want to put that pressure on my son. That you have to be the total best. You have to dominate everybody. You're going to be the best that ever live at this. He's put that kind of pressure on him. That's incredible. Would never do that to them. Yeah. It would never work. Probably. I mean, I don't think a kid that grows up in a loving household would supportive boxing for when you have nothing to boxing. When you did it had nothing. Cause that's a lot of, um, a lot of dedication. It's a lot of pain. That's a lot of aggravation. Louder. You know what I mean? Really? Yes. I'm discovering who you are, but you must be able to take pride in the fact that your children don't ever have to do that. Oh, and that's why I took the punches for, they wouldn't have to do now. I had my first might have to send a 16. He wanted to be

Speaker 5:          01:12:07       box of it. I saw you working with private school boxing, [inaudible] European trips. He did trips and us to vacation. You have to be a fight and kid how to hear the joke. And he's really soon. I think he's serious, man. I know a nobody. He lived to good fight. Some guy like me from animal can't know when my kids go through that crap. That's the degrading from guy like that

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       beating on you. Yeah. That's the thing is the fuel that you had, the, the burning and ferno inside you, you can't replicate that. They don't understand that. They don't, I don't know. You know, a lot of stuff. Um, in spite shaming inspires a lot of success. Yeah. You know, they don't have to deal with that kind of shame. Right, right. Shame, pain. Exactly. Feeling of being left out, feeling of not belonging, and you gotta write to this. I'm going to be, everybody's going to love me. Crazy feeling. It's Felix mentioned to get people because you wouldn't be accepted so badly. Yeah. Imagine that it fully accepted people that look at you, you know and know what kind of mindset of that, that that either want people to just look at you. Yeah, you're a sick fuck.

Speaker 5:          01:13:30       Want me to look at me? Look,

Speaker 1:          01:13:32       oh mom, man. Yeah, but it's beautiful that you could describe it that way now. Like you've stepped outside of it long enough. Do you recognize what it was when it was overcoming that? I used to be stories. Alexander the great had this guy was a god. Wow,

Speaker 5:          01:13:46       I want to be like that. You know? This is crazy. It's just crazy that you can inspire them,

Speaker 1:          01:13:51       that you're more than what you are. What was also those feelings of conquering? We're giving you the first success in good feelings of your life and the fact that they programmed you. I mean, that's something that I don't think a lot of people are aware of. The, the, the hypnotism to hypnotism and the putting those thoughts into your mind, which were hugely beneficial that you could tap into that mind zone right before you competed and they may need, they gave you a clear path. They give you a clear path to use your fury with this like very analytical approach with perfect boxing technique and an amazing mentor with incredible amount of knowledge. And they just let you loose to the ethic. Have to do the math. Yeah. Bad intention. Yeah. Being bad intention and having through the, and when you're fighting and loving every minute of it. Yeah. Look at you. You getting fired up again.

Speaker 1:          01:14:43       Do you work out anymore? Nah, man. Keep away from that stuff and they don't even like a, all that stuff, you know, spin class or anything. No. All that stuff. Um, and reactivate to my ego. Oh really? Yeah. Oh Wow. Don't they get ripped on us today? We activate it. That's the thing about like extreme winters, extreme winters that, that that ego is hard. My Ego. I'm a lose lose. I'm losing this candidate. I'm gonna lose everything. What have you let go jogging. Can you go jogging? Nah, I can't do it. Do My treadmill working stone treadmill. That's it. But if I thought the thing that I'm specialist, I get a glimpse, a glimmer of that thing for, hey, whoa. Yeah. Get you you better than though. I saw a video. You're hitting the back recently. It was like a couple of years ago, you still had the bag.

Speaker 1:          01:15:30       He still throw some bombs partly for the camera. Yeah, that's what you are doing it. But I'm like, damn, you can still move. You still have it in you, right? I don't know. It's in your body. Have to be, I don't want nothing to do, but what I was going to get to when if you were standing front of that heavy bag and you start rattling off combinations and people, you start thinking like, Oh shit, I'm actually Mike Tyson. Like I was that guy. I am that guy who went through that. I am the youngest heavyweight champion of all time. I am that guy to destroy tyrrell bigs. I am that guy that knocked out Larry Holmes. I'm that guy, looked at my eyes, can look at that guy. I look at, that guy has given me a platform to help me forget about that guy. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       Yeah. It's, it's beautiful that you have that, that mindset. It is because most people who've accomplished as much as you have, they don't want to ever let the past go. Shit, let that go, let it go, but do you, do you recognize that, that that's a beautiful part of your personality. You had one of the most successful boxing careers ever, but you don't want it. You don't want nothing to do with it. You didn't want to. We want to acknowledge it exists. You wish it went away in order to arrive to that next chapter in life. You have to forget chapter that came before you and focusing on the chapter ahead of you. Yes. Yes. That's a great lesson and from coming from you, that lesson I think is going to hit home with a lot of people think though. Yes, a hundred percent a hundred percent because you accomplished so much because you were the youngest heavyweight champion of all time because you're the baddest man on the planet. There's big hero for a lot of people like me. When I was growing up to see you now say that's then

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       I'm done. Oh, nothing. I don't to watch it. I don't work out. I'm not, I'm not even a part of that anymore. I'm concentrating them on live right now and I'm happy and I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       People, you know Joe, that's really crazy, but when you think about this, listen, you know, being that person, that guy that sent me the psych ward a couple of times, they send me to so many other places to prison and they said, why I send me places. That guy is a trip. That's a trick. I had you in the underwear holding the tiger on the change the trip. What did you go to the psych ward for? It's freaking crazy. Violent. Probably thought about hurting myself or something crazy like that. What do they do when they take you in the psych ward? How do they treat you? Um, no, he's the same way. Everybody treat me. This is Mike. No, but I mean how do they take care of you? What did they do for you? I mean, how do they take Mike Tyson common down fucking pills.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       The something zone you out be like, cause I'm leaving and found me swag of it. Yeah. Yeah. That is what they do. Huh? Yeah. Just call me down medically. Pharmaceutically instead Zombie like if I'm going to look at, I told him, you don't know what's going on. Well you know what's going on with you can react to it. Jesus. And then once the got you calmed down enough to go, all right, you can go. I don't know. I don't think I ever get calmed down enough. It was time for me to go and I had to go, what is a day in the life of Mike Tyson like now? And like what does a typical day get up in the morning? I go to my office and my candidate for office, we do deals and we get investments and um, I'd come home at five o'clock and I go see my kids to live 50 at the office later and I come home and I hang out with my wife and my kids if the, um, it really bizarre life.

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       We stay in Newport beach now. Oh that's not really, um, it's very scale is very upscale, but it's very quiet and not like Las Vegas at all. No one. Then my daughter plays tennis up there, so we're pretty much, I'm situated up there. Not like I said, baby, we can't, we move to Hollywood. She didn't know we can't go to beverly hills. No. Cause the tennis hall of her Tennis Requirement for here in Newport beach. So we stay here. Newports nice though. It's a good place. It's near the ocean. It's got clean was here. It's um, it's, it's just different for me. I bet. Yeah. Did you like living in Vegas though? Cause a fight today gets, it was always crazy and everything. The fight did bring great parties though. You call, we get some great parties. Great. So you've settled into this business life, it seems like pretty easily.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       Like you, you seem to be enjoying yourself. Hey fender, I want to do and um, if I'm, if this is a fresh start, you know what I mean? I look, um, since doing the total, you know what I mean? My main objective and everything I'd been embarking on and being, um, involving myself with, it's all been kind of a fresh start. I feel fresh, it feels new and I feel that nothing can stop in that and could be in my way and it's just awesome feeling. So this is from doing that one dmt experience just sent you until I did one time, but I did it many, many times that, that right. You know? Yeah. This is really, um, I don't know what it is. I'm trying to figure it out, but I've changed. But you're still figuring out, I still know how. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:20:16       I describe it for a lot of people. It's like resetting a computer and you reset a computer. You have a fresh new desktop and there's only one folder on the desktop and that folder says, my old bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:20:26       This is Lithonia stop and saying, do my third way. Now sometimes I'm wondering this new feeling that I'm possessing right now, if it, I'm a real feeling this stuff really help I am I lying to myself again till the next moment, the neck feeling come to do some drills to be with somebody else and what's really going on. Has that feeling going to come back there this moment they feel, feel like it never coming back

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       it. It can never come back if you decide that it's never coming back, but you have to make that decision pretty much every day, but you can, you can never come back if you want or you could slip into the old ways. That's what a lot of people do. One of the, when a lot of people fall into drug additions, relapsing, when they relapse, they're not physically addicted. When they're relapsed, obviously they're clean and then he decided to go back in. It's cause there's comfort in those old patterns because this new way of life is just, they get anxiety. They feel like it's a lot of pressure to stay clean.

Speaker 1:          01:21:18       Well, that's explained it. I hate that. I always hated that. Oh wait, I never wanted to do, but then I do him again. I never wanted, I hate a thousand now. No, no. Come on. You understand what I'm saying? No, I don't want to fuck. I don't want that. And then once you do that and once you do it, then he's going all out. Now you haven't gone to liquor there. The girl, Oh man, this is just a dark, dark, vicious cycle. It's real dark. It's self destructive. It's all about ego inflating and self deprecating to stroke.

Speaker 2:          01:21:52       It also alleviates you from the responsibility of improving the hundred percent that pressure of like keeping it together, staying sober, being disciplined, all that stuff. Once it's gone, it's gone. Like Ah, I'm just fucking crazy. I'm crazy. This is just what I do. I'm crazy. And it's easy to fall into that trap. And that's what happens to a lot of people who relapse with drugs.

Speaker 1:          01:22:13       I never want to go back to that again. It's just a no win situation.

Speaker 2:          01:22:19       That's one of the great things about marijuana that people don't understand. They think that a drug is a drug as a drug. They're all falling under the same category, but you can use marijuana and just be peaceful and not chaotic and the opposite of make you think more about what the consequences of ruining your life

Speaker 1:          01:22:38       because they sound ridiculous. I got um, I got a foot in a way. Detroit, Michigan, one time a for Andrew Colada. I got 'em and tested and tested for marijuana and they charged me 300,000 hours. Jesus Christ find me $200,000. That's a lot of my, where'd that money go? Who took it? The commission get, yeah, when did coke with it? Yeah. That's what they did. Yeah. That's crazy. $300,000 for some weed in your system. Now you're selling it legally. Yeah. Miss, I'm just, this is just a bizarre situation. I'm just going with this bizarre world and see what happens. It's beautiful, man. Never thought you could do the sell marijuana without being in that business. I know at this stage in my life, when it came at the right particular time, I saw it online. I saw Tyson ranch online and saw something on instagram or something and I was like, that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:23:38       Yeah. Yeah. Why not, man? In this day and age, we look, everybody loves you. Why not? Why not go into business and never dreamt it? But it's just a no brainer. People gonna want to buy your weed just because they love you. I want to distribute all over the world too. That's where it gets sketchy. Yeah. There's some spots in Asia. You don't want to bring weed to know Singapore. You can get killed. I, oh yeah, no, but that's the, there's some parts of the world that the, if they checked it, yeah, like I went to Europe to buy weed before. I mean, and it with 'em they were throwing in the plant. They weren't fell into, but there was some of the plant you have to buy the plant went to the plant and make bud. Wow. Selling the plan. What's that purpose? They want you to grow your own.

Speaker 1:          01:24:18       Yeah, it does. The only way. So you're working with a bunch of different growers. Explain how you guys are setting it up. The whole thing we are working with as a growth, but my main objective is to be distributed all over the country, so to and also the ranch where you didn't have like a, a destination that's going to be, that could be our resort there and that's where people can come and go be. Um, it's going to be like, um, what's that big concert name? Going to have our own concerts, ditch and tell her I flipped the name of Coachella. Chela Chela Chela because it's going to be something to that effect. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. So you're going to do shows down there too? Absolutely. Yeah. We're going to do it. [inaudible] Gamma Governor will be our first show when Miguel is going to be our first show in February.

Speaker 1:          01:25:01       Oh Wow. Oh, that's amazing. That's beautiful. But listen, man, I'm, I'm very happy for you. I'm happy. I'm happy to see this. I'm happy to see this transitioning.

No, I don't believe I did. No, I don't think he'd smoke. No, I don't think he does either. But uh, if a clean cut guy, super nice guy, almost too nice. Like are you real farther? The tough guy. Yeah. His father was a savage. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so tell people, uh, Tyson branch, tell people how they can find more information. When you get to look up tie thing, rant. Just it's a, is it Tyson? ranch.com? Yup. Okay. Tyson, branch.com. And you don't fuck with any social media hunt. You don't mess up though.
