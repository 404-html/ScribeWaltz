Speaker 1:          00:00:02       The Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       Joe Rogan podcast by night.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Thanks for having me, man. I really appreciate it. I'm glad you're here, Jim. Yeah, you've got a very interesting setup and I've talked to quite a few people work with you and your unconventional ways and uh, he just, he got a great reputation, just so you know. Yeah. Hey, thank you so convinced of this time, tiffany scientific. Well, that reverse hyper, that machine that you create. I've talked about that 100 times on my podcast. Get that thing has done wonders for my back and uh, it's just, uh, a genius product. You're good. It's a, it's a genius product. How did you invent that?

Speaker 3:          00:00:44       I broke my lower back in 1973. You invented that thing in 73 while I started to exercise. It's actually about 74 started, but I brought my daughter back in [inaudible] 73 and I was on crutches for 10 months and no one was helping me, so I just come out, you know, I'd do back extensions where you hook your ankles and raise your upper body, but that would kill my back. So I thought, well, if I did it in reverse, so I jumped up on a platform, dropped my legs, raise them up, pumped up my back, didn't hurt, and that's how, that was the beginning stages of it. And then years later we've always been a private gym. We're not open to the public, so it was never out in the public. And then I finally made a machine years later and got my first patent in 1994.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       How is it that no one knows about that thing? I mean, how is it that it's not a gigantic success?

Speaker 3:          00:01:28       Uh, well we were actually, should we sell over a little bit over $100 a month? 100 machines a month? Well, I hope I've sold some of them for you and you have. I want to thank you for that. And that's the way you know, is like sex once you have you gotta you gotTa keep it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Yeah. I don't remember how I heard about it. I don't remember who initially told me about it, but I was having some disc issues and they all want to cut you open man. If you go to doctors, they all want to fuse disks and cut you open and there's all this talk and I was like, wow, there's gotta be another way. So then I started research and stuff and I don't remember how I came upon the reverse hyper, but I remember as soon as I saw it, I went, wow, that's a genius idea because you're just. The idea is right that when you're getting a bulging disk is because things are getting compressed. So just pull them apart.

Speaker 3:          00:02:14       Right? We've got another machine that belt squat machine we usually for grappling, we actually fight in there and it's just, it's not a reverse every bit to traction device as well, so we do an enormous amount of work and at the same time as the restoration. So what is the other one called? It's called a belt squat machine. A bell squat puts you in a platform with a belt around your waist with maybe 100, 200, 300 pounds, and then we grapple or or we spar or it could do anything. We actually lift weights and we use an enormous amount of wage. May Two thousand pounds in it, but why? It's building up your glutes and all the old lower, lower body is tractioning out your spine. And it's um, but the restoration street medicine next day you don't even know you worked out, but you've done thousands of pounds of work and that's why I've got the world's strongest soon.

Speaker 3:          00:02:55       Wow. So you started out as a power lifter. Shadows apparently started limping. Lifting I was 14 and then I went to my first time meeting 1966 and salt guys is really built. Never went back to Olympic lifting again. And then a power lifted all my life. Made top 10 for 34 years. That's why I'm so beat up. And uh, but uh, I love the sport. I love the strength and power also loves if it's, if it's in time or weights, I love it. You know, something you can measure, you know, it's, it's, it's good to be a. I like to work with football because I, I'd average three tents off, 12 linemen going in the nfl some when the NFL, some didn't. So you just never know. But I like, I like just basic things to statistics, you know, how strong are you, how fast are, you know, for the person who doesn't understand this, what is difference between power lifting and Olympic lifting, power lifting, you've been squat and dead lift and Olympic lifting a clean jerk and snatch part of the things that absolute strength, sport law the way could be very, very slow, uh, and Olympic lifting because I could to clean, you have four, you have two poles, front squat and a jerk, whatever your weakest at touch, what you're limited at.

Speaker 3:          00:03:58       But that's a speed strength sport. And that means velocity. Speed. Strength is intermediate philosophy. My sport had slow velocity and then if you jump, that's explosive. I'm explosive power and that's measured in past philosophies but didn't want to build explosive power. You Gen and how'd you get involved with work when fighters, because I know you work with Matt Brown and you worked with a bunch of guys. Well, not bunch. Kevin Randleman. Kevin Brown started Kevin Randleman and a tree. Kevin has experimented. First off, I thought I was afraid I was going to hurt the guy. It's not that you can't hurt these guys know they ever hurt me and then. But that's how it started. It was fun. And uh, back when Kevin, you know, when it was champion and one was, you probably know when he was probably around 2000. Um, yeah, it was somewhere in that range, somewhere around there.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       He was the UFC heavyweight champ. I know. I'm trying to get, um, you know, his buddy. I'm Mark Coleman down here and I'd never get marked down here. I went to his house twice. I thought he's going to kick my ass. I got it all psyched up and he starts staring me down to rock it back and forth and I don't really shit. And then I tried to calm me down to get the hell out of there. And then he said he wanted to talk to him again about a month ago. My Guy. So I go back up there. Same thing happened and then I asked Kevin, I said, Kevin, why you wanted to come down? And he said, well, he said he'd have to train. I trained optimally. I don't train on smartsheet optimally, you only need to have a bunch of stuff out in the first round.

Speaker 3:          00:05:18       He trained everything optimally, not minimal, not maximal. It's optimal. So when you take a guy like Kevin random and like a stud athlete like that, like how would you assess like what optimum is for a guy like that, but that's when he was the first guy I ever had. And you know what a freak he was on men. So I'm Tom, which a lot of guys right now and I mean Kevin was used freak. You saw Kevin? Yeah. So uh, we do a lot of sled work, upper body, lower body and a lot of the dumbbells for time like him and I, he, he is so upset. One time we tie, they did a 107 reps with 75 pound dumbbells in five minutes on a stability ball and he tied me. Wow. We both did 107 reps and he was highly upset. He's one of the best athletes ever in the sport. Oh no kidding. Super Explosive. Did he win the UFC heavyweight title? I know he fought boss Rutan and I think he lost the title to Bas rutten office. It was a real controversial decision because boss was hitting them off his back.

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       He broke boxes, knows that, right? I'm sure. Yeah, and those breaks are pretty common habit. Almost every fight. Yeah. At least some sort of bright. Almost every fighter has like some kind of a DD deviated septum. What you see in our fighting is down. Mark was probably champion UFC champ, but fighting is changed now. You know, you know that every week you're there. I'm only at home and in my recliner watching it, so it's so much more sophisticated. I love MMA because it's highly technical. A lot of people, you'll hear people boots still when they get on the ground. I love the ground game. I love that. Thank you. Have to think. Oh, it's definitely very technical. Well, what's interesting too is that there's all these different approaches to strength and conditioning and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you because one of the things that I had seen was matt working out with you and your guys and he was doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       Like when you devise a plan, like for an athlete, like a Matte Brown or someone like that, like what do you do? You work with them first and try to figure out what they're capable of and then think about what their style is like. Obviously you're gonna have a different, a different need if you're a striker versus grappler. Well one thing we do, we try to get them where they're conditioned to do five minute rounds and recovering. One minute. When I worked everything was five minutes and minute recovery. Some guys had went through eight rounds. A lot of guys I was able to do that. I mean pretty good fighters, you know, 13, 13 wins and and pro fights, stuff like that. So just whatever recovery I want to maximize the amount of work it can do it five minutes and then be able to cover in one minute and do it again repeatedly.

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       That's all I ever did. Work on five minute intervals. So did you work with guys, use heart rate monitors and how did you decide what to have done? Any of that? Really never now my print now John Sattler, he's got Shitty Chi Jujitsu. He's basically started almost ready to first MMA school in America if you think about because he was judo, Jujitsu Samba, but also striking and he started in 1995 and he does everything by heart rate where we do take by percentages, uh, like said we trained by a range of velocity, speed, strength training and 75 to 85 percent. He would do heart rates like that. And like if you and I would grapple with, we could talk to each other for a half hour, that'd be optimal. You know, me and you can talk while we're doing it. That's an optimal heart rate that, that way. So he kept track of heart rates, basically how we do a percentage of one rep Max.

Speaker 3:          00:08:38       So meaning that it's optimal if you could still talk while you're doing the extra train optimally you knew you're not like, you know, that's how I would be in here. No. So, but if you're going to fight, like if you're in a fight and it's a very high paced fight, it's very likely that you're going to achieve much higher of heart rate would be much more exhausted. But see, that would be up to much how we train our speed. Dave, I to today for squatting and deadlifting is optimized. They do a 25 squats at one way and two for speed strength acceleration into 20 deadlifts and then the other days Max effort. And that's what you're talking about, what you go all out and around someone's pushing, you know, they're trying to take you out. So you've got to fight back. So it would say it always changes.

Speaker 3:          00:09:20       You can't do the same thing. It's called the law of accommodation few night. Uh, if you and I grappled at the same rate all the time, I would actually catch up to you, you know, so you'd have to be able to maximize your potential and run me into dirt. So that's why you got to have few different days, you know, you can't just do the same type of work all the time. I think that's where a lot of projects go wrong. They get wordy pages up too much. You see that before fighters, fighters cover up. And uh, you know, I, I'm gonna Watch fights all my life from Roberto Duran to Mohammed Ali. I've watched him. I'm sure you've got to be a big fight fan and you just see how some people get in a scheduled amount of work per randomly and that's when you beat them.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       Take them out, you know, another word, you know, I'm gonna. Make you go at my pace, not you go, in my opinion, I'm gonna. Go call your patient will make you feel it. Mine. So varying the intensity of the training varying how you do your training. You think that's very important, very important. Hence the change those zone. So does it have to change all the time because the body just adapts and gets efficient? Try that as well as ask about it. In Law of accommodation is you adapt to a training loader stimulus and if you don't change it, you get no better. You actually go backwards so you can actually got to change these stimulus. Tom Does a lot of stuff of war barrels. We push we're bells around for half a mile running sometimes heavier weight walking, get into belts. Clot is very grueling. And then just a maximal strength.

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       Went to simple things like deadlifts, good mornings. We do a lot of stuff holding the bars in their elbows come has to do a lot of that because almost like, you know, grappling, pumbling and then uh, other times, you know, you got to do quick stuff. So quicker page stuff. So, you know, it does how fights are their number one pace. Now, how do you create a schedule like say if you're working with a guy and you, you, you know, we don't believe in schedule, you don't believe in it. Now, even my guys, I had the strongest gym in the world, spoke about 140 all time world records at breakfast and time can verify at breakfast in the morning at 6:00, 6:30. We decide what we're going to do that day because he drinks majored in time. It's not measured in weight. It's measured in time.

Speaker 3:          00:11:20       Talking about velocities and so we just pick an exercise like for you. If we did a real low box squat, didn't takes longer than squatting. Eight hundred pounds. Your gun squad a hundred pounds. You know you choked me out after a while. I'm gonna tap. All right. Or if we run after awhile, I'm going to run out of oxygen and I'm going to quit. Say thank for strength, economic strain, so long, so long as you strained at least that length of time or longer, you're going to break a classical lift and squat venture debt with. I'm not totally sure I understand what you're saying. I'm like, why do you have different? You have. When you grapple, you're going to have different opponents, big ones, small ones, fast and slow ones left hand, right hand, right, and so you, you, so you adapt to all different situations. We, that's what we do.

Speaker 3:          00:12:04       As long as our training is harder than a contest, we're going to break records. I took a gentleman not long ago, a 800 pound squat at one 65 top of the world right now, 1880 total top of the world, I promise the one year old world record in less than a year, each quarter, 80 pound world record until of 2008. And we just got systematically, we run everything in ways three for speed. We work on speed, strength, exhilaration and we. So he goes, uh, is basically 75, 80, 85 percent. And then on the fourth week we way back and start over. We changed the bar so that way by changing a safety squat bar, if you know what that is, or even a front squat, we changed them link to the spine. Um, you know, without really, you know, you only got one of the spine, but we do it systematically by using different bars so you, your brain has to now think differently because it's got a bar from where it sits on top of your back. Your lower back is different. So it has adopted that every three weeks.

Speaker 4:          00:12:58       So by changing bars and changing is like the type of workouts you do, it forces your body to adapt all sorts of different loads or all sorts of different ways of standing. All sorts of different outputs.

Speaker 3:          00:13:10       We change. Your leverage is constantly changing leverage and where the bar has to keep going the same, you know, like your car. I talk about this all the time, you know, if you look at your car, a normal car, it will shifts at 2,500 rpm. So every time it shifts gears, well that's optimal horsepower for that car. And so we traded it to a certain percentage of the bar. Speed is optimal for postal power. Or if we want, you know, it's 30, 40 percent. I'm like, well, I'm want to take you down and I'd work on 30 slash 40 percent, wait til one a muscle you, I've worked with 75 to 85 percent wage, so it'd be strength speed, and if I had to really grind you out, that's why we got to make you stronger, you know, how strong grapplers are. And uh, so we work on all, all different philosophies and string inside of one week and in where instead of doing high reputations, I'm like a person Icu, let's say your lower back is susceptible to injury.

Speaker 3:          00:13:58       You might have 600 pound legs and, but only 450 pound lower back. So we work a individual muscle groups, single joint activity like reverse hyper works your low back hamstrings and spinal rectors, right? We got a special machine of works to hamstrings. Uh, we got all these different apparatuses that were different parts of your body. So we don't have any Muslim bounces like MMA if you've got no stand up, I'm going to stand up with you. We've got no grappling. I'm going to take you, you know, so wherever you said we work on all these witnesses have balances, so we have constant balance of our strengths and abilities and we're capacity

Speaker 4:          00:14:32       and so because you don't have a schedule and because you decide what you're going to do that day, do you just kind of assess like how your athletes are performing and what they, what they're capable of doing given the each individual day.

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       We have records on all kinds of things like penn dead lifts or box deadlifts or some kind of squatters, some kind of bench. They break the entire gym. Now there's only maybe 15, maybe 15 guys. It was a private gym, but you break the record over 90 percent of the time you're in, you're out. So why'd you decide to have a private gym? Like how come? How come you don't open the same commercial gyms? I can't stand to be around people that don't know if you're a real fire. You don't want to be around a bunch of facts, right? I mean I can't stand. I can't stand to go into commercial gym. Can't stand it. I just got out, I'll leave in five minutes because they're not working out hard enough, not worry, not hard data on what the hell they're doing, you know, looking in the mirrors, looking girls and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       I like to ask, but, but um, uh, gym I want to work out, then I'll go look at that. So you just decided to set up this year. We should do like a little tour of the gym at the end of the iron sharpens iron, you know that, right? So if you're one with the, you develop a limp. So don't hang around people like this. And how long have you had this gym for? Well, I've, I've had a gym. I started training by myself. I had a top toe in the world, 1973 for a while until I brought my back. But I've, you know, I've had a gym book would training partners since 1976. She got my first part in 19 six. It's always been private. Is it my basement? I went to my garage and we had to start getting bigger and bigger and bigger is not better, but we had to get bigger because we started to attract a lot of people that were good.

Speaker 3:          00:16:03       I mean they're selected to come here like anybody else in English, so they just pay a membership fee or something. I pay everything. You pay everything. How do you keep this place running? This business right here. Oh, selling books and videos. Machines. I don't know. We got um, got like 11 or 13 patents I've paid my money comes from royalties from putting my name on different companies. That's really interesting. So it's like almost the gym itself doesn't bring any profit. It's just reputation. Probably 50 grand a year. Wow. When you say 500 years, did gym costs me 55,000 a year. Wow. But it's one of the most respected places in the world. Science and most famous gym. There's no sign you don't need a song? Yeah. We're pulling in here. Like where the fuck is this? Twice. That's what you like. Yeah. Wow. That's interesting. Well that's, that's about as hardcore as it gets.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       And it's how it would choke him into lovelace because a lot of people like who the fuck is, they're not that old. Back in the day, you still power lift yourself and. No, no. I had to quit five years ago. I mean I kept up my neck, gave out when I was 63. I did at 7:30. Squatting to meet 500. Five bench six 75 to 70 when you're 63? Yeah. Wow. My neck just gave out wide. Starting to pass out all the time zone. You start passing out all the time because of my neck. Like what's going on and to compress this. What? Yeah, totally. It's the basically from my mid back, from my deck to my mid back is like locked up all just from carrying heavy weight, heavy squats and heavier. I was squatting for 10 when I was 14 years old for 10.

Speaker 3:          00:17:37       At 14 to 16 to content support. Keen at 1:40. Wow. It hold new. 60. I'll be 69 in two weeks. But. So how old were you when you were saying that you lifted all that weight? The law, the most recent 63, 63 and that's when you done, you're like, that's enough. I was passing out and you know, I couldn't pass out and I came off a platform and I expect for him was described good. It was 7:35 and he said No. I said, what was wrong? He said, you pass out. I mean, I didn't know. Then I was on Queer Street, I noticed as real dark covered. So when I went I made it through. That meant I needed to get an 1885 total is actually 37th in the world that year. Wow. And then, uh, I mean I thought I could actually tell what 2000 pounds if I, I was doing training which was squatting the age, but, but because it needs context, you were geared, it takes longer to get up and down.

Speaker 3:          00:18:26       Just caused me to pass out. Now. Have you ever thought about inventing something that would strengthen the rest of respond the same way you did the reverse hyper? I wish because I've got two devices. It definitely worked for the lower spine that I, I need something from upper right now. Um, I just went through a series of stem cell. I don't know what you got. You get stem cell stem cell in my knee, both hips and my shoulder and. Right and I just yesterday had platelet injections in my knee and my hip. You got to go back next week, but I'm not, I get nerve blocks in my neck, you know, I'd love to get my neck well, but I think my also got kicked in my leg, uh, by a kid. A fight or a small one. One 35 and he screwed up by. Nice.

Speaker 3:          00:19:08       So that didn't help me any. Why did he kick you in the leg? But I told him to kick me in the head. She didn't kick me, don't kick me in and he kicked me to nene. Torn muscle in basically must be, or a hamstring right above my knee. Will you guys sparring or something? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm just stupid. Like dude. So he's still spar? No, no, no, no, no. I keep. I can barely get around now. I had a fracture is called 13 guy hit me in a hipaa baseball, 13, 10, broken jaw and broken hand by 18. You know, you didn't have him in me back then. Have you thought about inventing something that would have strengthened the cervical spine and linkedin? Know I got on a boat of things I just said we're gonna. We're going to introduce the machine.

Speaker 3:          00:19:50       October 21st going to absolutely change of strength training as world knows. It's called a static dynamic of Elbert. It will change. The world is static dynamic developer. What is that going to do? Well, it's like if I hold elbow and a get pressure on your arm and go in, I have a machine that's going to hold you like throw a punch. Hold it, let it go. Buy Button. Hm? I'm not sure. I'm just watching you. You do a a judo. You ever see judo toss where a guy, they'll tell you in crash pad, like one for. Well, we'll hold you down while the other guy tries to throw. Then the guy, let's go. Yes. Same thing. Just like that. What? I mean, I have a machine that could do that. Oh, interesting. So you could pull like as hard as you can and can't budge. Me and I released zooming. Is it possible to develop something like a reverse hyper that works on some sort of a neck brace? Like a similar type of movement? We've done reverse hypers with NEC harnesses. Yeah. Where you're working in the top of your spine to the very bottom of your spine. Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:20:51       Now how would that. So you would do the reverse hyper with which to people are just listening to this. What a reverse hyper is, is like say a table. If you put your upper body on a table and your lower body was suspended underneath the table, like hanging underneath the table, you would attach your ankles to this harness. That's like a leg curl attachment and you lift your legs up straight and then when you let your legs down it's pulling on your spine. So it's active

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       pressure. Right? And what would you do with your neck? I've put it, we use it, but put a neck, arm or song. So when you're down, when, when you raised that, when you raise your feet, we also read your upper body and then so when we do have to use at neck harness, you're working the very top of your spine right up to the atlas all the way down to six. So

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       would it be a neck harness? Like with weights on it? Yes. Okay. So just like a regular neck harness, like where you hang your weights down and you do it.

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       Yeah. So when you pick up your feet, you pick up your head as well. You, you rub it down, back and forth. That's interesting. Huh? That seems like a great idea. Thanks Joe. Yeah, I bet you do.

Speaker 4:          00:21:57       Well, you mean as soon as I saw that reverse hyper machine, I was like, well how come this isn't used constantly because it totally makes sense. It's Trenton's the back and a very strange way. Like I brought in a bunch of people that have had back issues and they just try it once and then go, whoa. I'm like, yeah, why the fuck is this thing? Not Everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:22:14       It's marketing. You know Tom Barry here. Does one marketing, but you know, we're just starting and I never tried to market. I didn't care. I didn't care about my business, cared about my gym now he cared about my gym on my life.

Speaker 4:          00:22:25       It's one of the most, it's one of the most common injuries for people who lift weights or for people who grapple, like I know a lot of fighters who have either have had diskectomy where they take a chunk out of your disk or they're getting disc replacements. Now a lot of guys are getting displacements because it develops a pretty new technology in Europe where they have these articulating titanium disks and they just cut out all the gelatinous substance between the discs and they put this articulating mechanical disc in there and guys were getting great relief and they're able to start fighting again. I know rick story has to have them in his neck. Um, uh, quite a few guys have had these things done where there their back was just too fucked up and they just couldn't do anything. It's another actually replacing disks. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:23:09       that's what happened to me. But with you, they wanted a fuse. You right. I had two doctors, 2005 but would not pregnant on me. She says she dangerous. That was 11 years ago. Why too dangerous? I don't know. Is that Ohio state do you sent me to, to, to search into Ohio state and he wouldn't operate on me. And you wonder why it was because I was taking, I was living on Nyquil and tylenol pm.

Speaker 4:          00:23:30       So it was too dangerous because you were taking so many pain pills?

Speaker 3:          00:23:34       No, they said it was at that time there, the procedures they had, they thought it was more dangerous not to operate on me then leave me alone. But I mean they weren't going through me. I've been trached. I've had chest tubes. I have a thoracic outlet. What do my doctor here in town? Outlet threat cutlets with. A lot of people have open heart surgery. So you can't put your hands over your head anymore. Um, I went to my doctor. He had me put my hand over my head and raise my head and my pulse stopped because it basically goes in and touch his carotid artery. Why it stopped my. Yes, so when you would raise your hands over your head, it would compress your carotid artery. What's causing it to do that? Because it would push whatever is doing and would just cut the oxygen.

Speaker 3:          00:24:16       See if I. If you want to tap me out and just puts her head backwards and I'll go to sleep for you. Sounds like head backwards anymore. Powerlifting sounds fucking terrible for you. Like you know, if you had grappled guys, wait one second. You all your life. I grabbed hold of guys away to 2,920. Well not exactly what it's like, right? Yeah. You know when you want to unlimited turn tournament and you get some 285 pound monster on your hands. Same thing to get bigger and bigger. It's A. You're burning the candle at both ends. So you know the weights each Sheila, but you don't sound like you have any regrets whatsoever. I don't regret if I hadn't been beat up and all my life. I've never learned what I learned. You know, people make fun of me is. Oh, you broke your back in 70 through your broker math.

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       Well, you know, I have no bicep. Tore my bicep off. $70 towards this and off a knotted up right here. That's where the bicep ties into your forum. So both your biceps had been torn off and it never stopped me. I told this and I'll totally. And they told me I was done six months later, won a national championship. Third biggest total estimate. Pulled that. Let me see what that looks like again. So it's gone. It's gone. You have no bicep? No right here. So that's insane. So you don't do curls it very few curls. Curls don't matter for us. Curls for the girls, Sandra. It's all extensions. Extension. Wow. But that's how I learned. You know, how you going to learn. So when you tour it, you didn't even think about getting surgery to get a return. I went to three surgeons to set operating one second.

Speaker 3:          00:25:39       You don't care what it looks like, don't operate. And I said I'm not operating. Wow. No, I said six months. So they are made to third highest over, made my way clients and then you had to fuck up the other one I don't believe or not, but I told them my patella tendon and half, I'd never done curls like you said. Yeah. Richard enhance many catheters over here. So I, uh, I was doing curls and then talking about freaking payslip and Jim, I'm so bored I couldn't hardly do anything. So you were so bored because he tore your mortality. Say, well let me try these curls and then you want to blow in your bicep. I Petroleum, I took Patel. I was never going to let the kid because I was 43 at that point and I'd done about everything that I was going to do a.

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       and then, uh, so like four years later I had a kid who was training me these world record holder at 20 years old in the bank, seven, 28. And I told him, I says, Kenny. I said, man, I've got my retirement is caught seven for you ever been seven again. He said, old man, you don't interrupt several pounds on your back again. I brought me every time I write a seven eights and nines I squat, I have a second biggest squat in the world at 50 years old, at the fourth biggest total assist because brought it up

Speaker 4:          00:26:43       to you like, hey,

Speaker 3:          00:26:47       you run your. Run your mouth. You know, the good thing was he made me. He made me do that, but he never did break at bench record, so I'm always thankful for. I'm very motivated by anything and get a highly motivated person.

Speaker 4:          00:27:01       Now you've also been real open about steroids, which I think is very commendable because it's one of those things in the world of power lifting the world of bodybuilding and even in the world of fighting, it's a dirty, dark secret that people like to keep to themselves,

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       but your grandpa can take it.

Speaker 4:          00:27:18       Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:20       I, I believe in my, in my opinion, there should be. You should pass the physical. No one has the right to tell you what to do in this world. When it comes time to die on the one that's got a di, someone's time for me to live letting me lead to life. I want to live,

Speaker 4:          00:27:33       but what do you think in terms of the problem with a lot of people have the problem, the problem they see with using steroids in sports is it's going to force young people to use steroids to be able to compete with the people that are using them and do it anyhow. Yeah. But if everybody's forced to be cleaned and they don't like what we're doing now with the UFC, you were like the Usada the, the people that have stepped in and Jeff Novitsky running that program. The guy who caught Lance Armstrong.

Speaker 3:          00:28:02       Well actually, Lance Armstrong was never caught, right? He passed. He passed 25 tests for seven years in a row. I never was tested. See, it's not against the rules to take drugs. It's against the rules. You get caught taking drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:28:15       That's a fucking loophole.

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       You got a good doctor. You're on the craft or not. Not. So that's why there should be no, uh, uh, Tyson period said an even playing field stop the drug test. I'd say the same thing. Not Old Barn was seeing my testosterone. That's true. I mean, when I was a kid, even if I was born today, I would be in prison. You're not telling me to teach all these, you know, some of those fighters have got way more testosterone than another fighter. That's true. Not Born at same amount. So the only thing you could, why not train? You got a better. If you got a better, uh, you know, if you could kick my ass because you do Jujitsu and shit and I don't do any, but that don't mean you're tougher than me. I just means you got a better coach in me. So are you cheating me?

Speaker 4:          00:28:58       That's a good point. But if two guys do have the same coaches and they do have similar body types and one guy's taking steroids, he's going to have an advantage. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:29:09       But isn't at pharmaceutical. What are you looking at? Watch TV every five minutes. You go to a drug commercial one. Every year I'll be 69. Let's take all the god, I'm 68. I'll be 600 to let's take all the health medication off. Six to eight year olds. I'll be the only one left on her. I don't have any ailments. Tom will tell you my problem is they go to the doctor does note some Romaine. There's nothing wrong with me. I just beat the crap out of myself physically. I don't have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, I don't have anything and so let's just take all the drugs away. But all the old 68 year old guys off is well. Well be the only one lit for a guy like all the old women.

Speaker 4:          00:29:47       Well, for a guy like you who's not competing, and was he one of the arguments for fighting is that steroids allow you to do more damage to your opponent and that that is one of the reasons why steroids should be illegal is because you can train harder, you have more endurance and not just steroids, but things like epo and bunch of other stuff. You'll have more energy in a fight. You could possibly land more blows, possibly wind up beating someone that you wouldn't be able to beat and do damage to them. So it's different a lot of ways,

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       but why? Why wouldn't person take us force for him, you know, is called PDDS performance enhancing drugs. Why wouldn't you do that in sports? Well, his. Because they would think of it as cheating. Well, who does? Well, a lot of people don't know how many guys are cry their eyes out, but get caught. Then he cried like bitches and a lie. Right? Baseball players, they don't. They never took drugs. You get caught in a car like bitches. That's what I don't like. Just tell them. I'll tell you, I'll never read the Bible, but see the billboards on the freeway says, I shall not lie. Just quit line and come out and say I'd take droids you know the NFL. Why would you be in this for like the NFL? You know, what drugs do is for recovery. That's all it is. You know, you take.

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       I can give my strongest people I've ever seen doing. I've seen guys take board drugs than anyone I've ever had much. Really? Yeah. Jugs up make you strong. You're born that way. You're born Fascia, born slow. You're born with an attitude or you're not. Well, that's the big misconception about steroids, right? Is that they make you bigger. The work makes you bigger, is to recovery, cause you to recover, to do more workouts. Right? So everyone doesn't want to do workouts. How did the people, you know, save you want to be an MMA fighter, intimidated in a cage one time and never get by. Coleman told me, Mark said he had a million restaurants when he had hammer house here. Soon as they got onboard one time, but he never came back.

Speaker 4:          00:31:42       But there's, there's a mild benefit to taking testosterone, a bunch of other stuff without doing any physical work. But almost all of it is in the fact that you could put in or

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       work and you recover far quicker than the average person. Yeah. But see that way if everyone took it, you're not cheating. You know, you don't, you gotTa, you gotTa, you got a corvette, you don't have to put high test cats in. Don't you think that like it also for young guys, you can fuck up your endocrine system and fucks up your body's production testosterone. So what? So that's what hcg sport, you got to spark doc, you take her. Everybody takes hcg because your muscles shrink up because if you take roids, you take tests, you're taking more in mother nature told you so you're not measuring cup, but there are morons anyhow because you took act, you're nuts. Wouldn't drink up HCG. What does that stand for in tropic hormone? It raises all your home men's vendors and sports there. You cannot. There's no sportsmanship in sports. It mean you were still fight in

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       front of a big crowd. Half the crowd will want me to knock you out. And the other half the crowd would want you to knock me out. Is that sportsmanship? Well, that's just people. Sportsmanship is supposed to be the athletes competing without cheating. I mean if, if, if there was a pill that you could take that made you invulnerable, gave you like a God pill and you took anyone into a fight and the other guy thought he was fighting a man, but you're, you're invulnerable. No one can hurt you. You can't be hurt and you don't get tired, which you have superhuman strength. That's a good point. With share Roy still be legal or illegal type point. Well, it would be better than steroids. It would. It would be like a superstar Roy, but I mean, wouldn't you think that that would be cheating? No, no, no, but we'll then nobody can beat anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       You just beat the fuck out of each other and nothing would ever happen. But in the hills right here, it all starts up in your brain, man. See, I kind of could see how you can make that argument with other sports, but fighting. I mean fighting is about fighting. Is problem solving with dire physical consequences. I mean that's what it is and if you can minimize those consequences through drugs, a lot of people would think that would be cheating. I look at this, I look at the Diaz brothers. I'm guessing they got a lot of testosterone. I don't know who in the hell their dad was, but he must have a lot of testosterone. Well, it's interesting. Those guys eat Vegan for the most part thing. Nate eats fish and eggs to. I don't even know if Nicki's fish it might have in the past, but I don't think he does anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       I think he's pretty much Vegan, which most people that eat vegan have lower testosterone because the substrate for developing testosterone is fats is like cholesterol and fans and one of the most important. It's. It's like when people get on ketogenetic diets, one of the more interesting things that happens when they consume a large amount of fats and saturated fats and cholesterol is that their testosterone goes way up to high cholesterol diet. Yes. So I don't. I don't necessarily know if those guys have high testosterone. What they do have is high endurance endurance is through the roof, but a lot of that is because they participate in triathlons, a lot of endurance running endurance, swimming, biking, things along those lines. So it's. You still have to have the brain thought to go kick someone's ass. Right, but don't you think that Ronda Rousey has that brain thought to.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       She doesn't have any testosterone but makes. She has some but not a lot. You know what I mean? But more than other girls have, but not more than about Cyborg. Well, that's a little different. Well see that's the argument for steroids right there. That's the argument because she actually has been caught, but she's actually tested positive and she's passionate test now, right? Yes. But you know as well as I do that when a woman takes male hormones for a long period of time, even if they get off of them, there's benefits that they keep forever. Same thing with men. Yes. And just because you're passing the drug test, I won't say who, but I trained the top international shot putter. He could go off and apart and eight days pass a drug test, IOC said. I will say say that's it. It's only eight days. You can get onto the Nana par se antibodies, one of the quickest ones to get

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       off of. Right? Yeah. So I mean you. I mean how I forget to take stuff for eight days.

Speaker 4:          00:35:45       So the benefits unquestionably are permanent or at least some of them are.

Speaker 3:          00:35:49       What I think about, you know, what you're looking at. You're looking at a fight and career as you see it in an envelope and then when that day that tough part retires, you forget about it, but what about the years later after a fighter's career, if he was on antibiotics, he would survive the fighting years and be able to continue with his older years like me.

Speaker 4:          00:36:08       So what you're saying is that listening? Well, longevity post career, I totally understand that. A lot of fighters believed that as well, like testosterone replacement, growth hormone therapy for guys who have retired, but while they're competing themselves, they don't want to do anything because they don't want to think that the reason why they accomplish those goals because they were taking drugs. I could shoot tons of Roy and so much that I think will make them kick my ass. It's not gonna make them kick their ass, but there's no question that some fighters fight better when they're taking steroids. How about just a nutritionist? Let's just cut out the nutritionist. Yeah, but the nutritionist. Look, look, everybody knows how to eat healthy. I mean, if you're eating healthy and you're training hard, but one guy's taking steroids and one guy's not, there's a giant advantage with the guy was taking steroids. I just know too many people take steroids and then the passenger test. That's all I'm trying to say. Right. Well that bring up any names. I understand and I know you're not, but that's one of the reasons why the UFC is instituted this incredibly invasive. You sought a policy where they don't wake you up at 6:30 in the morning. Well, how'd you like that? Watching piss in a cup. I don't like it exactly, but that's the only way to catch people.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       I just. I'll never go into a drug test. I don't think the NFL, she had drug tests intro.

Speaker 4:          00:37:24       I think there's a good argument there. First of all, it's a good argument for baseball because baseball, no one's getting hurt in the NFL. You could make the argument that you're able to hurt guys more and then that damages them and it shortens their career, but. But baseball does no argument, in my opinion. Baseball's boring as fuck. And if, I mean some people like it, I get it, but what I'm saying is like if you got a drug that lets you hit more balls over the fence, take that. That's the only thing interesting about.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       So how do you let that sport get away with it? You know what I'm saying? Why not make it legal for all, you know, like baseball's a funny thing. You know, if you hit less than 50 home runs, I guess your drug free, but you start hitting 51 year old roy dry. It seemed like as what this core. And he talked about the base, the steroid here [inaudible] we're taking a drug to 19 sixties who they trying the kid where they. Yeah, in St Louis, you know, a football team. Um, you know, the raiders. Uh, I've heard stories where I think it's documented on espn. Never gone in and had the ball tabs on the training table. Alright, well, you know what I say to the raiders or the baseball team, the oral, the um, the aes athletics. What was like, if they're in the same town, you sign these 200 and sexual wondergirls room section about the girls. What if no one has it? They knew football players were taking it in in Oakland, but why wasn't, why wouldn't the baseball player if you taken it right down the street.

Speaker 4:          00:38:53       The other problem was what do you think that people were thinking of steroids as being, uh, like that kind of power being a crucial aspect of baseball.

Speaker 3:          00:39:00       But I think what it was. Sure. But baseball is more of a skill game, don't you think? Did anyone ever tests Mickey Mantle? Roger Maris, Hank Aaron, you think Hank Aaron was doing steroids. They had steroids back then. Shirts 19, 39. But where people were athletes taking them? No, exactly. Yes. That's what I'm trying to say. Get the football team was taking it. Why wouldn't a principal. So we'll get these fortunate result geeks. Anyhow, they interviewed the goddamn thing in her life, but they're also a hypocritical and they got these ideas and they're popping on air. Probably taken a, you know, a testosterone therapy as it is. I was that apparently one time and his doctors are big fat guy and he's talking about how bad boy josh does listen to them and then like for instance, what's a patch on here? He says, well, that's a testosterone patch. What kind of thinking is that? It's a true story.

Speaker 4:          00:39:50       Well, there's a lot of hypocritical. Thank you. When it comes to that stuff for sure. It's just, it's, it's an interesting debate and a lot of people think that you should be able to do whatever you want, like the pride days during the pride days, which in my opinion are some of the most exciting all time, mixed martial arts fights. Those guys did whatever the fuck they wanted and the Japanese literally told them like in their contract we will not test you for steroids. They told them that

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       hell at horse racing. Dog Racing. Yeah. But everybody that's okay. And he just worry about that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       Well, echo poise, poise is equity. It's got a horse in the fucking title. Yeah. I mean, and that's something that people take and it's a hormone for steroids, for, for horses now. So you don't think there's anything negative with. There's obviously got to be some drawbacks of steroids, right?

Speaker 3:          00:40:45       I went on antibiotics 19 January 1970, 1970, 1970. And uh, so what was this? Two Thousand 16? Yeah, I'd never been off.

Speaker 4:          00:40:55       You never been off in 46 years. That's insane. Just stay on them. I try no cycle in that. Go off to tell everybody you're off.

Speaker 3:          00:41:08       I get sad. I go out there and tell the truth. I don't lie to people get upset at you that you're so honest about it. I don't give a damn of the upset of course, but I'm just curious if you ever come up at the council of self respect and I give him hell about these geeks. They're not doing crap. They suck when they were kids. They suck when you're middle age and they suck when you're old.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       That's how I look at our day in prison. I'll be on Roy John Little country road. You wouldn't be putting our world wouldn't be in shape us in the day if they had some nuts, but if they had not stayed, wouldn't need steroids. Right? Because then let's say some aggression, some aggression. Yeah, so my friend was a psychologist and he would test people in prisons, rapists and murderers. He said he had tested some, had 25 times the rate testosterone's normal man does 25 one time. That's why I say, you know, it wasn't even possible. Well why are they out there raping people and why they killing people with no, no remorse because he got an enormous amount. He said that he saw. That's why they probably did it. He didn't, you know, if you can't do that stuff, he realized that. But he thought that's why they will be on a course to do stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       It was just absolutely crazy. You take a look at elephant. These elephants a well they call it when they. It just ease. I'll test house on route, killing each other and knock it down. Villagers and everything. So the world needs more of that. Well, I think it needs more because of the look at the. You know what, when I was a kid, just 10 percent gay. Now they say there's 34, 34 percent, four percent fluxes that. But college is good. I believe it. Boy Bands. There's no ways. Thirty four percent. Four percent. Oh Man. Okay. Well I'm sure some would test out. Terrific. I look at Jeffrey Dahmer and he's out there killing people. Well, he was gay too. Yeah, that's it. But I don't think. I don't necessarily think that's a testosterone thing. Right? That's a sociopath psychopath thing. Who knows? I will say that. Well, I don't think.

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       Well, I'm not talking about the gay part. The other part we're eating people. Yeah. Yes. I mean that. But that's. But that's not a good argument for testosterone if you're seeing the prisoners and rapists and murderers have a lot of it. So everybody has got a lot of opinions about Roy's, but I've seen probably a thousand people on Roy's over the years. Right? Okay. No, maybe more. Right? That's right. The ones who took the most drugs were not always the strongest to strong guys. Didn't take that much and uh, a lot of them. And then, and the lesser guys take a ton of shit, but he just can't necessarily. That's not what strong. Well, isn't there also a point of diminishing returns where like taking too much of it throws your body out of balance to the point where he's not going to recover correctly because your body's constantly dealing with this and it makes you crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:43:56       Right? He can't concentrate. Yeah. That's a, that's a real problem that people don't want to admit it. The roid rage isn't a real thing. I've seen it. It's real. It's 100 percent real. I don't think there's such thing. Roid rage. You don't think so? No. Well you said it makes you crazy. Yeah. But I don't seem to have a little guys. You know, there's plenty of fighters would fight a 300 pound guy because it was just crazy because you're crazy. You know, it's not causing on roids are fucking crazy. Right. But when people are taking too much steroids and it makes you crazy, a little guy's not going to jump on a big guy and get his ass. Great. You know, because of Roy Price, he'll do it because he's. He was born that way to do it. There's two kinds of people praying predator. You'll find out which one you want to. Real quick,

Speaker 4:          00:44:35       your prayer Predator. Lou, you're in this like very insulated world and a lot of ways, right? Because you're constantly around these savages. You're constantly around dudes that are just fucking lifting and crazy heavyweights. Very manly men. A lot of guys are doing steroids. A lot of guys lifting weights like that's your world. Like this is the. These are the types of people that you surround yourself with. A lot of people that are listening to this right now, like, this guy's fucking crazy. Who's this guy with no biceps and been on steroids for 40 years? Like, this guy's a maniac.

Speaker 3:          00:45:06       I Dunno. I mean I, I was born to do something and I did it. I, I, I've never strayed from the way I've done one thing. I'm going to go to the day I die. I'm not going to quit what I do everyday. I've got to try and make me better or someone else better. That's what I do. That's the only thing I've ever done and I never quit it. Well, for you, for a guy, if he was in my gym, I would find a way to you to make you a better graph here. I believe you. I believe you would just my job.

Speaker 4:          00:45:34       I believe you would now being 68 years old if it wasn't for all your debilitating injuries that you've gotten from lifting crazy amounts of weight. You look great. You look very healthy, like, like very healthy. Like you have energy, you're very, you know, you're, you're on top. You're on the ball. When, when I'm talking to you like, do you attribute a lot of that to take the steroids that it gives you that energy?

Speaker 3:          00:45:55       We'll enter testosterone. I mean, Lord, I'm not saying I might be dead, but I mean I wouldn't be sitting here. You wouldn't be talking to me. You wouldn't know who illusion is what. I mean, I broke my back in [inaudible] 73. I had no training partners. I was on crutches for 10 months. Everyday I get down in my basement. I looked at a mirror ahead, Amir and an am radio and in that mirror and said, how am I going to get better? What I gotTa do everyday? I've never to this day. I mean I can't go until. I mean you just can't pass out. He killed me in to God's witness, so that's what got me out of my sport,

Speaker 4:          00:46:25       but he was listening to this and here's that pounding on the roof. That's Ohio rain folks, metal ceiling and the roof. So it's nice for us in California. We don't get any rain ever. So nice to be down here. Get some rain. So what stuff do you take?

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       I mean, right now? Yeah, just testosterone, testosterone. What have you taken normally when I've been trained, but take a donabell capitalists, you know, I just did tests. You talked about that composer like that component. What about human growth hormone? Orange waste of time doesn't work. It's a waste of time. Yeah. How so? Well, you know I took is human growth before HIV came out and kidnappers called Chris Corman of ride. That's the stuff that came out of people's brains. They took out a pituitary glands, right? That's right. Well then when it made sense not growth hormones, they never made some enemies. Somatomedin triggers not a trope in wishes, growth or some matter meeting. What does it about to meeting triggers? Growth Hormone. And if you don't have, they never made synthetic. Some atomy. I mean people take growth hormone and how many people, you know, take growth hormone.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       If you take hormone, you have to eat around a guy your size, you'd probably have to do seven, seven, 8,000 calories a day. Is that blood sugar attacks one after another? You don't. People don't do that. Why? Because it doesn't work and it knocked body fat off. You see people losing body fat and no, it's a joke. It's a more um, what's the word? Placebo effect in anything. So you don't think it helps people recover from things? Anything? I took tons of it. I've been prescribed it. I have a fake shorter fake shoulder. Yeah. What's going on with shoulder? I had to have a shoulder replacement. Wow, okay. If pros had a frozen shoulder, had to replace this one and then um, uh, so I got tons of growth for them and it didn't go through him or not, I just gave it away as waste. Wow. Dr [inaudible] study you. It seems like everything wrong. Fake children really.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       And what, what and what a exercise benchers you bench press over 500 or the fake shoulder to doctors.

Speaker 3:          00:48:31       I did 24 reps, 100 pound dumbbells with 2,400 pound dumbbells. Jesus Christ. That's insane. It's in the mind. So you're saying it's all in the mind, you know, there's a book a fighter's got. Remember his name is called pain don't matter. It don't matter to me. I'm so freaking used to paint. It don't matter,

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       but it's a fake shoulder. Like I don't mean are they, are you supposed to be able to lift that kind of weight in a fake shoulder? Like did doctors tell you, be able to go

Speaker 3:          00:48:58       back to training? I had it done by the doctor. His name is Dr Bianchi was the Cleveland Brown searching at the time and he basically gave me no instruction. I left the hospital that day, I recovery and uh, never I did my own therapy to give you no instructions already knew. He literally, it was new at the time. He kind of wanted to see if it would hold up my, my, my buddy march was a strength coach with the browns. He said this guy is crazy, you know, so he wanted to find out this thing would hold up and it must have held up because I mean, you know, and it's still okay now, man. Wow. Score and you see this, you don't believe me? Oh, I believe you. Yeah. Wow. PCB did stuff. And so when you got your soldiers shoulder replacement, how long did you wait before you started lifting? Heavy benching? I started pinching in one week, started to branch to come one week. That's so crazy. How much will you benching one week? Not a broomstick, but in, um, in three months I benched 300.

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       That's so crazy. That's crazy. Well, in that case, I got to think steroids helped your recovery. I try. Well, that's one of the best things for it, right? Is recovering for injury. And that's one of the best argument is send it to athletes and nuts too. You just can't sit around the doctor. Take him for eight weeks. That's why. Don't go to doctors out of being a leg becomes a quacks. Surgeons, that's all they know. They don't know nothing. They were experts on everything.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       So I don't know this Dr.

Speaker 4:          00:50:30       well that's one of the best arguments for steroids is post-injury recovery, right? It was for. It was for concentration camp victims in World War II. Nineteen 39 antibiotics came up for concentration camp. They tried them to. People come out of concentration camp, prisoner of war. That's what they make. Antibody was first thing they made him for. Well it's really good for people that are wasting diseases. Same thing if you're in the prison of war camp and give you some sort of vitality back. Yeah. Yeah. So when when you see guys that get injured and you see them try to do things without steroids, like especially injury, like injury recovery, I think that's one of the best arguments that like maybe when an athlete blows his knee out or something like that and get surgery, they really should be allowed to use that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       Do you think are in America professional athletes? All tone was in her at least 100 times more. There's a couple million older men taking testosterone replacement. So that's my art met. Why would you not let an athlete? What is the difference? And that's what I just said, but I don't care if you don't. If you don't want to take, I'm fine with me a damn. You don't wanna eat a protein shake. You don't eat right? I don't care.

Speaker 4:          00:51:41       Well when it comes to eating right, like what kind of. What kind of Diet do you subscribe?

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       I really don't describe. I eat eggs and meat in the morning and I ate pretty good. You know what I mean? A lot of chicken and rice. I'm not entered a good food. I've seen people real clean. They have no aggression, so like a lot of bodybuilders super clean. It seems like I have no aggression and you know, if you're like what I outside the throwing punches or kicks, it's the same. It's a fight. You gotta fight these big white jeep. You guys stay on Dad, you gotta lift it and then you got to do it over and over and over. Just like, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       11, 10 to aggression now. Do you think that that's the lack of cholesterol in the Diet? Lack of fat?

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       It may be because I've just seen them. I mean, you know, I've been around too many people. Bodybuilder also. They were the one that had the side effects. You'd get around. They of the guys that have no facial hair and uh, you know, or nobody here. It seems like those were the ones that I've noticed over the years and has no side effects. A little bit of drugs will give them side effects and other people, you know, you always talk about taking stuff for a to come out. I've never taken anything like God darn life. I've never needed anything for Gyno, for one made a real tough looking guy. He'd never had any problem taking raw because they're already got testosterone. It's not a. it's not something new to their system, but guys get guy. No, it's just because they have a ridiculous amount of testosterone in your body. Starts producing estrogen, high estrogen anyhow. Oh, so you think it's just. Exactly. Because I've seen guys with big, thick beard, rough kind of guys. You don't have no problem. You don't have a problem. I'm just telling you what to. Right? No, I get it in lab. I'm only telling you what I've seen in my, in through my many years, what I've seen guys, the guys that get whacked out on drugs where the guys are very, uh, you know, I'm not Finland, Finland, but almost kind of

Speaker 4:          00:53:33       when, when the person who doesn't power lift or people are unaware of the sport and they, they, they think of a bodybuilder doing the same kind of things that have gotten, like you would do, that's what they think. Oh yeah. But that's not the case. What is the big difference between bodybuilders?

Speaker 3:          00:53:51       There's a high purpose, high reputations in the eat different. They take other things different to get very big and then we don't want to get big. We're just like, we wanted to stay in the smallest weight class we can and get as strong as it was, the same big Ang strong, strong, strong. So we just want to be strong, so everything we do is not to build larger muscles. Like I've worked with track people, mostly girls. We don't want to put 10 pounds of bodyweight, almost 10 pounds of extra weight that it had to overcome gravity rundown down track. Right? So we keep keep your body weight to a minimum. The muscle mass, we just want to make it strong. You don't have to get bigger to be stolen.

Speaker 4:          00:54:26       That's confusing to a lot of people because a lot of people think of big muscles meaning stronger and that's the only way to get stronger. But I've seen some people in power lifting competitions. It just lift insane amounts of weight and they're not that big trunk. Well how is that possible?

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       But muscle type, you know, you're always talking about you. I've always mentioned you a few times. You talk about like a wooly and says, oh my muscular. He runs out of gas real quick. Who? Tyrone? Tyron Woodley. Yeah. He has the same. Got a pretty pretty much the same amount of muscle mass. He just has very fast twitch muscle guy. You, you're not about to. Endurance may have board slow twitch muscle and then so that guy, that's why he can fight five rounds and tyrone were to start to wear out somewhere in the second round.

Speaker 4:          00:55:07       Well, it's also because a guy like tyron is capable of putting out so much energy, like the way he can attack guys and move so fast. It's like having a 500 horsepower engine versus having a 400 horsepower. One's going to just use.

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       Yeah. Well just fashion. She got sprinters and marathon runners and it looked totally different.

Speaker 4:          00:55:28       Yeah, and so when someone looks at a bodybuilder and they see this guy just covered in muscles, they assume that guy will be able to lift a ton of weights, but for the most part those guys can't live nearly as much weight as a garlic. You can know that that's crazy to people like that doesn't even make sense.

Speaker 3:          00:55:44       Well, like a lot of things are crazy. People do don't aren't in and know what we're mentioning. What about the anabolic stimulus? Does it frustrate you that this lack of understanding the general public has about this stuff? Absolutely. Yo you ever. You ever look at the Olympics? We look at our weight lifters, Olympic weight lifters. We don't go to the Olympics. We never did hope to never get any Olympic. Never tend to worsen, so if there's ever been. They said our Olympic weight lifting team is pretty bad. We can't get the guy on the 18th. All right, and they're just not very good. You look at our women's gymnastics people, they're extremely strong. Ain't a blurb out of the water. You Go China. There are male weight lifters and female archery ministry muscular and they killed everybody that your gym's look pathetic these because they're all in different systems.

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       She didn't know who they are. You got better coaches and and better systems that take stuff so well. American doesn't have good Olympic power lifters, Olympic weight lifters, lifters. We rule the world power of Jews in this country. American witnesses are not very good. They're not know terrible. Really? No, I did not know that. There was one girl what got a bronzy Olympic one girl got a bronze. We in, in my sport, there's 12 male way classes. Uh, we hold seven of the total records my Jim Holtz to and in women there's 10 week classes. America holds nine of the 10 and my Jim holds five. I have the strongest male power lifter ever lived. Period. And the best and the strongest female it will bury St Jim. Now what about shit like those strongest men contests? Oh, well her strongest guys. But that's a different thing entirely as well. It's another defense. Like boxing is different than intimate. Yeah. More, you know, more ties different in boxing. You know what I mean? You never said I'm going to say it in a more Thai guy that's going to win a world boxing championship and vice versa. But I think it has

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       happened. Ty was what the fuck is his name? Oh, there was a kid though. I mean, the gold medal is thought Thailand packet. I think you shouldn't have your key. Might've been a one time champions on. Right? Oh, Chris Algieri. Yeah. He was a kickboxing champion. Time to work out. What's the fuck is his name? I forget his name, but there was the guy that. He's the guy that John Claude van Damme was always supposed to fight. John Claude van Damme pretends is going to have a fight. It's going to have a kickboxing fight with this is Thai guy and. But that guy won a world title as a boy tie fighter and as a boxer. But that's pretty rare. But I agree with you, but now like what would be the difference? See like if you see like if you had a guy come to you that wanted to win, like a strongest man competition, that seems like something that will be right up your alley because you're so good at preparing fighters and understanding the different demands of different sports.

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       My friend in Finland's name Chicago, he's got poor guys in that gym over 900 and they're all strong man and he does. He trains of Straw man. Alright, I'm not into that, but he told Tom and I had one thing in each sprint with barrels, thousand pounds on willpower. We do a lot of willpower work and also to carry heavy yoke. So that's two of the primary. Thank you. Get them to be strong men. What's a yoke? A Yoga thing, putting me back in your walk around with it. Like if you walk around, we do an enormous amount of walking with bars with a badge and change hanging off. So it's unstable because that's what you have to be. You got to be stable and unstable environment. So they walk a half a mile of stuff like, I don't know about it. He gets his strong.

Speaker 1:          00:59:13       Is that why you like wheelbarrows? Because it's almost like a dead lift that you've got to kind of walk with it. Like I'm going to price you will get more type fired at. Doj thought that really helped us up is um, is plum colored clinch. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, so did you come up with the idea of using wheelbarrows for nine, 1990 and it's just something that looked to you like a good unstable platform that builds up your ministry ministry, building up your back and grip, you know, you've got to have a grip. So, you know, you guys got great grips anyhow, but it builds up grip and it builds up all your muscles and your walking. See My, you know, a lot of guys do strength and conditioning. I believe it's got to be combined. You don't have that much time because fighting is a treatment and skill.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       You need all your. I mean the world's strongest man. Hate the damn the MMA champion now. So I believe you got to strength and conditioning st time. That's why we do so much outside walking. We're doing heavy objects walking. So we're conditioning and strength training. Do you pay any attention to Marius [inaudible]? Oh sure. He knows what he's doing now. He's fighting MMA. Oh, I knew he did. I didn't know he's still doing it by lifting strong man and went to that. Yeah. He's um, he's, he hasn't given up. He's been doing it for quite a long time now and he's actually beaten so pretty good guys at this point. He knocked out halls, Gracie, and the first round he, um, he lost it. Tim Silvia. But that's a fight that he never should have taken. But you know, Tim Silvia is big giant former UFC heavyweight champion, but you know, you see tim, Tim's got like a lot of body fat on him.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       He is not like the most gifted athlete in terms of like, like randleman is like a freak athlete. He was when he was alive. Recipes. Who's a great guy. I love Kevin, but he was probably one of the biggest natural genetic freaks I've ever seen. Tim's not that Tim's just hard work and dedication and just toughness and he beat the fuck out of Mary's [inaudible]. It's kind of funny when you see the two of them together. I might've saw that fight. Yeah, he might've have, but he started out. He started out kickboxing. Denise, before we even went into a, I think he kicked box when he was a kid, puts an asking, did he? Maybe it was a boxer, boxer, boxer, okay. Boy, do you not believe it when you see him hit the pads and he was starting out. It was like, yeah. It's like almost like, you know, he's weighing himself down, like throwing weights all over his body and trying to move himself.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       It wasn't, but my point being he's actually transition is become a legitimate professional mma fighter who's beaten some guys. He's not. Not Bad. I mean he's not. No one's gonna say he's a threat to the UFC heavyweight title least at this point in time, but it's interesting to me because he still 300 plus pounds. He's still a massive, massive guy and he's fighting. All these events are all places where I don't think they test them too, which is interesting too. Tim. Sylvia, when he was at his best, when he won the title against Ricoh Rodriguez was on some shit, but he was a. He looked so different back then. He didn't look like a

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       doughy sort of heavy guy over his best example. Ubereats? Yeah. When when overeem came to the UFC, when he fought brock lesnar and you know, it was kind of the wild west of testing back then all you had to do was pass the post test. That's it. That's all you have to do. Which was, you know, like you were saying, if you take an avant, they just get off it for eight days. You're clean, you know, but the facts were obviously still there.

Speaker 3:          01:02:48       Exactly. Yeah. I mean and has always been the drug of choice for collegiate wrestlers, you know, way back years ago because the fact it gets out of your system so quickly because he keeps your body weight down. You want the demurrage really bodybuilding, they take drugs that you know that on low calorie diets he can maintain muscle mass. He touched the Princeton I think was the only one kind of antibiotics. Why isn't bodybuilder look like I do and was part. You know why they look different if we're taking the same drugs? Because it totally is totally different. You. Yeah. That's one of the orientations. Totally different.

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       One of the big dirty secrets about Vegan bodybuilders, like almost all Vegan bodybuilders are taking something and the reason being is because of the fact they're not getting enough cholesterol, they're not getting enough saturated fat in their diet and so your body just does not want to produce that kind of muscle mass. So those kind of guys are almost all taking something in order to put that kind of mass onto their body.

Speaker 3:          01:03:42       You know, say we are trained to Olympic gold medal spreaders. Alright. I've trained all kinds of people and so it's not like you just been around power lifting. Everyone I know, you know, there's a rate like, you know, we will get back to the drug tests. You ever think about the Olympics? People were records that the drug at the Olympics. What records of her breaking world records drug free. Why do you need drug testing? Maybe one of your callers calling me up telling me that one. Well, because they're passing the drug.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       Well, well they're also catching them from previous years. Now you hear about the, uh, the Russians, those two guys from 2008, they got their gold medals pulled from them. Just bullshit is bullshit. It's bullshit because you think other people were doing it too, of course. But Russia has a very sophisticated anti-doping program in America. Divergence now let's say that America I don't think is so blatant about their endorsement of drugs. I think America kind of knows about it and, but they can't come out and say it or come out and

Speaker 3:          01:04:46       if you're overseas, the pain just went to them. What place you got? They don't care. How do you don't think they care? No. Course. Not Overseas. No, because it's, it's, it's done by the state uses. It's done by the state. And that what the problem was that Russia was guilty because it was state funded drug administration. Okay. What do I mean? They're doing the same thing happens. Report.

Speaker 4:          01:05:08       Well, not just that rush is killing the scientists. All the scientists know about it. A good giant percentage of those guys had been shot in the fucking heck we've been reading about that. Oh, they're dropping

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       like flies. Yeah, all these guys, because once Russia got in trouble, they were, they were in danger of being eliminated from the Rio Olympic Games. You know about that, right? Yeah. Well, no, they didn't. They, they allowed them in. Now there was no way that they don't forget how many people. A couple hundred Russians did not go. Oh really? And you know. Yeah. And a girl here in America, it's a high jumper I think, or a pole vaulter which tested 33 times in three years. That's bullshit. It's total bullshit. I had victor content on my podcast, you know, he has the ball co guys. I know who he is. Yeah. He pushed all the roysher ever and then he's a drug test her. Well now he's okay. He's performed here for Peace Now. The. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       Yeah. Um, he's, he's an interesting case, right? Because he was a guy that had developed a designer steroid that was undetectable, which they still have. They still have those, how they break and world records and not bucking the drug test. You know, I was born at night joe, but it wasn't born last night. See, I was. And, uh, I like to believe that people are just, it's just hard work. And folks who, uh, believe in that, do you think it would be better if everybody just came clean and everybody just did whatever they wanted to do?

Speaker 3:          01:06:39       Exactly. I really did. I think or know why is your dad, why? Why possibly is your father on going to the ancient clinic and taking testosterone growth hormone? It was that damn bad that you hit. Your Dad wouldn't be going there. There's a couple million people I know. You're just that guy. There's probably over 2 million people doing it annually. Why are they doing?

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       That's a good point. It certainly helps you. It makes you and your brain function every. Everything's better. It really, your drive, your muscle, your muscle. You've got more muscle. He got better bone density. You got better sex drive and get better dry period. But I mean, mine is never changed. That's my whole freaking problem. My brain's never changed since I was like 16. So your brain's still functioned the same way. I think a lot of that

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       face never get around a person. And you just look, here we go. We're going to kick your fucking ass because I don't know why they just can't my camera. I just want to punch him out. I can do that. Do you think that's road rage? Not really. Bridge. This was when I was born. I was that way when I was 10 years old and I'm that way now. I just teach sometime. Does it go? I want to. And you know, it's weird because I can get around. Old Man is no threat or nothing. Me, I'll go, I want to punch this guy in the face. I'm serious. I know it sounds, but then I go, I can't do that. I know I can't do that, but I'm going home because. Because there him and chuck is bitches gonna Choke your ass. I'm not, but I don't think it's enough in my brain and say, no, you're going to go to jail if you do that. But that's how I've never changed right now. I don't know if I'd say sometimes I think, Gee, I wish I changed. It'd be a little bit mellow. Like I'm supposed to be.

Speaker 4:          01:08:19       Well, a lot of 68 year old guys, they're, they're, they're slowing down and they don't have a lot of zest for life. GRANDPA turns into grandma. Yeah, it does happen, right? Yeah, that's right. You say I kinda weird too that you can go to like any kind of a nutrition store vitamin store and this shelves are filled with muscle builders and recovery. This growth hormone, that and fake test house rooms. Yeah. Well, and a lot of them turn out to be steroids, but then he'd go to use against all. Well it is against the law, but you sign it has a page and when we had no Wicki on the podcast, and this is when I found out about this, I was blown away because they have list. What was it like? It was over a thousand more than a thousand different products that have tesco have steroids in them that people are buying under the guise of just being some natural muscle builder or you go. So there's probably thousands of people on here in America and city year against taking drugs, but you're taking drugs, right? Well, there's certainly a lot of people that, well, you know, there's a lot of people that have taken drugs and they don't want to admit they're taking drugs, like people want a drug free America, but they want to drink beer and they want to drink coffee and they want to smoke cigarettes. All these things for trunks. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:33       Yeah. I've said that you'll go to a football game, like a house steak. You got to, you got 100,000 drunk take, you know, up and smoking cigarettes, watching 22 athletes on the field that are clean. That didn't make any sense.

Speaker 4:          01:09:47       I can't drive him out the parking lot. Do you think that leave even for high school athletes that like steroids are a good idea?

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       I think when you're able to vote you out, build you anything you want at 18 years old, God, if you could drink, why couldn't you take roids if you're, you know, I mean, I still believe it should be the draft. I think that's what's wrong with America today. There's no draft, there's not enough people that have a father figure in his country and I think if they went in the army, you eventually have a father figure. I was. Ios actually was a bought 10 or 12 years old. I tend to block during summer vacation and then during school, the guy who picked me up and I actually knock holes out these that thing. There's called a knockout. I will knock out these blocks and putting the word take out. What's a block tender? What does that blog tenure? I carried block and mixed mortar cement block.

Speaker 3:          01:10:35       Twelve years old, 12 years old. I started working at 12 years old, I guess. Social Security card. Twelve years old. That's right. Wow. That's how I grew up and I, I grew up by if I want to make money, I got to work. No, I had nothing. And uh, you know, uh, my, my parents had money, but the party there were party animals and so I didn't get nothing. I bought everything I've ever done since I was 14 years old. No one's ever given me nothing. People, you know, with these guys day, I pay him to lift, you know, if they make a world record or get on our board down there to get money. I never, I would never take any money. I never took nothing. He's guys get protein, they get free gear. I took nothing. I own anybody, anything. And when I die I won't owe anybody anything.

Speaker 4:          01:11:19       So you think that way by saying that the draft exists, like forcing people into the military force to them to serve would at least give them some discipline and give them, like make them understand what hard work really is.

Speaker 3:          01:11:31       Caucasian and discipline, you know, what's going on with the police force, you know, in America today. It's just a lack of, it's just a lack of common sense and I mean authority. They don't have, you know, represent authority. I, I grew up, uh, I remember was I used to play baseball. I can help people to story. I was like 12 years old and we played this game. If you hit a ball out the yard, you're out. But if you had inside, he already got the second score. You got to score to run and it was just you against me with a neutral pitcher and I slid into second base. I was 12 years old and my neighbor was a high school senior. I, I'm memory probably like 220 pounds and then he gets up and he said, you're out. And I said, I'm safe. And he slapped the hard as he can slap me and he goes, you're out.

Speaker 3:          01:12:11       I was out. I couldn't kick his attitude. I grew up a pecking order. No one knows what a pecking order is and number to picking nowhere you over, but is that good for society to have that kind of a pecking order? We wouldn't be ran over by all these countries right now if we had a pecking order. Every look at the picking order now they're all, you know, you go to school because you got bullied. You know, I got kicked out of school in first grade. Okay. Not for a day. I got kicked out for the first grade. A kid stole my shoe. I won't tell my dad said, hey, this guy stole my shoes on their side to Columbus here on east side, and he says, well, I'll tell you what he said, if you tell me that tomorrow, a basic to basically said, if you told me that one will kick your ass.

Speaker 3:          01:12:54       So I go to school kit tristate Mushu. I punch and get in a fight with them and teach it, breaks it up. I ended up punching the teacher. They take me down to the principal's office and the. And they said, you're kicking me out of school. So my mom says, for how long is it? We're kicking him out of school. I'm going to first grade. So we moved across town over here on the west side of Columbus. You know, we'll say Barbara, but he wouldn't let me at school. I had to set it on a freaking year. I didn't start school at seven years old. Wow. From Punch the teacher. All right. What kind of teacher can't take a six year old punch? I have exactly. It's basically back then that seems ridiculous. But I. But I still think that. But you know, no one has any, there's no trades in America, you know that they're talking about this now knowing you don't have any tradesman. If they went in the army at least two years, you can get a couple of years of college free education and something gets something from the government instead of a handout from the government.

Speaker 4:          01:13:45       Well, some people think that it would be that mandatory military service would be good because then they would realize the consequences of war that would really understand it. Like Israel does, like Israel, everybody has mandatory military service and their patriotism is at a very high level because of that, because they realize that they're all connected in this giant army. When the army goes toward that literally is them.

Speaker 3:          01:14:08       I believe the same thing. I just think it would change. Think I can say this country so sick. You know, your, your, your kids are older and they got these things because your kids building well, you know, I'd rather be the bully then to be bullied. I bullied everybody I kid could and the bigger people bullied me. That's just the way. Is that good though? I know my role in society, but wasn't a little bitch and acted like I run my mouth to you and you touched me. You know what I mean? I go call the cops. Right? You beat my ass. Fuck that guy beat my ass up. That's just the way it goes. I mean, I've got 13 teeth. Okay. How are you thinking? That's why I got 13 from running my mouth.

Speaker 5:          01:14:52       Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:14:54       and I don't have no regrets. No regrets. It taught me lessons. Was that the only way to learn lessons though? I think it's a damn good for you. I think it's a good one. You can't think you're something that you're not. You just have to grow. That is a problem. I just know what you really are. That's all that matters. Well, I think a lot of people think there's something other than what they really are because they're not tested because they're not the. You know how many people in this life go through difficult physical struggles on a regular basis? It's one of the main things that human being, especially men, one of the main thing that men lack in life is very difficult physical struggles that tests your character. Exactly right, but being a bully doesn't test your character or somebody that be bullied. What's all UFC fighters in the cage?

Speaker 3:          01:15:42       Well, once they get in there, but that's competition. I know. I mean, I know they're great guys outside the cage. Matt Brown, you know, they're all nuts. This Greg Guy, I get crazy looking eyes real quick and she's got crazy eyes. You Fuck with Matt Brown? That's a big mistake. I mean that's a real. That's a test. And you got to be tested. Yeah. And you know what? It don't get sad old thing. You don't mark, you get knocked down. Can you get back up? Got Back up to million times. I'd never don't give a damn. I mean honestly, it don't matter. You know, like I always said like Canva, if Kevin will beat my ass. Well, so what? He beat a 100 other people. I'm just. That long list would be be my ass. What? I feel bad. No, it can't be. Feel honored. I got Kevin relevant, kicked my ass. Well that's because you could overcome that kind of shit. You've been through shit like that before. You understand what it's like to have a bad moment in life and it's not going to wreck you. Brush yourself off. Yeah. That's the problem with people. When your children get bullied and they send them some kind of cool because you're bullied and my father sent me because I got bullied, I'd blow my brains out.

Speaker 3:          01:16:47       Do you have kids? No, I knew I should've never had kids on eradication. Wow. How'd you. How'd you manage to get through without knocking up one check. My wife didn't want to have kids and I didn't want to have kids and she grew up pretty poor and like four or five brothers. Your mom raise your cut. Your Dad got killed in a car wreck it too. And I never want a kitchen. I mean my life's for. Okay. I don't have time for kids. I wouldn't have time to be a good father. I knew that. So why would I have kids? Well, that's a very rational way of looking at it. I've been married 43 years and I'm as you do that because of daylight,

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       that's a smart way looking at do you have like when you, when you look at your life, I mean at 68 years old, you've accomplished so much, has this great reputation in, in power lifting and you know, just in, in helping people and athletes, especially in mma. I mean when I talk about you to the MMA fighters, you know, you, you have a fantastic reputation. I mean, people just go. They just nod their head and like, that guy's the shit. You know, he knows his stuff. Do you have goals at this point

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       in your life? Yeah, I should've got goals because we got to keep a couple of products. I want to get out before I die. You know, I've gotten mechanical reverse hyper. Did she talk about it? She'd be an hospitals over the world and mechanical one, so it does it without you lifting weights is put you, stands you up and it will put you in place. It can move your legs back and forth. You get well then would assisted in it, you could read, it would have resistance,

Speaker 1:          01:18:16       so for someone who's like maybe two a week to actually lift the weights up,

Speaker 3:          01:18:21       like if you couldn't move your legs, visitors you'd like, I can move your leg. You say okay, that's it. Okay, that's it. Then week after week until we finally get that full range of motion, once we gained full range of motion, then we could put a resistance to mechanical resistance for you picking up two pound, three pound or whatever, but. But it's static dynamic developer. I'm coming out was going to revolutionize the strength training for every sport. Well, I'm interested to see that. Do you. Do you have that here? No, we've got it on film. We can a little bit on film, but when you feel that you would not believe it. Yeah, I'm very curious. I'm very curious to see what that's like and I got one more book on writing a book right now and then I'm pretty much done with discussing the editor and have it track and field a track now.

Speaker 3:          01:19:03       Feel just track for sprinting and distance and just about developing strength for helping strengthen reducing injuries. There's so many injuries now. What about an MMA, a dessert. Do you think there's a way to reduce injuries and MMA through powerless? Too much. Really? Yeah. I think he's far but too much problem. Then, uh, I used to talk to guys way back in the [inaudible] campus. Big that guy because it was 95 percent of fight. He would go there. He was a kate one fire and he said, and I think you've got to slow that down because you're, you know, they say in boxing fights, don't get you. It's as foreign. Yes. So that someone was firing, working on skill and work on your skill. Was this thing. They say that because that's the trend. Now, Donald Cowboy cerrone, who's never looked any better than he does right now, and he's on a tear.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       He said he stopped sparring. He doesn't spar. Says all I do is do drills. He goes, I already know how to fight or know I'm tough. He goes on, don't waste myself in a gym. We have the greatest squatters bar ever in the history of the sport, and we don't squat. We settled on boxes. We don't do regular squats. What do you mean? We sit down a bunch of just sitting on a chair. We will and then stand back up. I taught were you training to. We go to a contest, then you got to do a squat. We don't do any regular debit with a rope, a bar, and real weights. None. And our top, our top five average is 890 and

Speaker 1:          01:20:21       10 is eight. Sixty six. So you, what do you do if you don't do regular dead lifts? We do bands over the bar in power racks. We use two or three different bands over the bar, meaning elastic band

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       instead of my edge, 220 pounds of attention. Like if you picked up, you know, 200 on the bottom, you stand up, it's 4:40, right? Okay. Or we got stronger boundaries. Oh, did you have to kind of bands and, and uh,

Speaker 1:          01:20:41       we just do a lot. Stuff like that. So what that means to people that are listening to this, when you have these elastic bands on the bar, that makes it more difficult when you get up to the top of the range of motion. That's the same with chains to it. Better? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       changed. It's called accommodating resistance, but it builds a tremendous acceleration in these. A lot of band camp treat mentioned acceleration to very bottom because you knew you had at the outrun the bands.

Speaker 1:          01:21:03       Right? Right. So yeah, you have to outrun the bands and then when you get to the top it becomes more difficult. So you when you have just a regular deadlift or a regular squat with it doesn't have any of those bands at the end you have more horsepower. Exactly. Huh. So you don't do any regular squats or any regular deadlifts and you think that that helps you out. That preserves athletes as well.

Speaker 3:          01:21:26       Greatest. Squatters your greatest male female pilot. We had a number one, number two, greatest quality of all time and I've got a one 65 I think have become. He's going to be the great squatter bolt on or thinking about 950, five pounds of one 69,

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       955 pounds at 165. That's insane. Dot eight nine. He did that easy. That's incredible. And keep him out of jail. Oh, it was crazy. And a little bit. How weird. Wow. Let's just say he's. We'll just say straight down. Yeah. Well, I would imagine. Well, I mean it's not the case with almost everybody who's like at the very top levels of anything. Normally people only give you normal results. Whew. That's a good quote. That's a good quote. That needs to be a meme as normal people only give you normal results. I don't need normal people. Yeah. That's an interesting way of looking at it. Well, I mean that's what I was saying before that you're kind of insulated because you're in this world of savages, you know, in your attitude about things like, this is not an attitude that most people have in 2016. Everybody's worried about everybody's feelings. Everybody's worried about being sensitive. You know that this is the time of toxic masculinity. People worried about masculinity. Strange, right? Forgot like you. Isn't it strange I'm going to do. I think the world is screwed up and

Speaker 3:          01:22:43       you know, I, I, um, had told Tom to buy all these books and the straw man back in 1900 and they all look like mma fighters today. Men Don't look like at today like I did back then. No loan before roids. They looked like gamers loaded to the gills and there wasn't a road back. He was probably, food was better. Maybe, I don't know, but they all had attitude and everybody will kick your ass. So I just, I don't know that I can send to warrants to soft man. It's got to be hard. You can have an easy life because once things get hard, you're screwed. I see that in my sport. I watched guys will accelerate them so fast and it gets hard to quit. We like in a fight. I'm done. I just quit tap. I am, I'm Outta here. You know, punch me in the face. Well done. I'm done with. That drives me insane because work hundreds of hours to get these guys super, super strong and then they quit,

Speaker 1:          01:23:36       but doesn't that make you appreciate a guy like a matte brown or someone like who is like a legitimate check from that I respect for all finders. I mean, you know, any fire. Okay. What level? But they get into UFC cage. I got loud, respectful, but in 2016 does have rare type of person. Right? In this ever softening world, don't you think that's why MMA is so popular? Because everybody wants to be that, but they don't want to go through that work. It's also the recognize how unique it is. They recognize. I mean there's a lot of people that I'm friends with like MMA that they don't have those qualities themselves, so they appreciate them and other people.

Speaker 3:          01:24:12       That's exactly what I'm saying. Yeah. I've always admired fight. I'm a huge boxing fan, like triple g and guys like that. Me Too. You know? So Roman Gonzales' classical boxers, man, I'd like to classic because uh, you know, you go try to do it. It's not easy to do at no works insane. Oh yeah, and everybody thinks it's a brutal. Even boxing. I was a brutal sport and they think in the maze. I don't want to think that, but there's a lot of so much technique.

Speaker 1:          01:24:37       There's more technique than anyone would ever really imagined. Ridiculous. You know another thing that fighters are getting into a lot lately as yoga. That's a. that's a big one. Did you ever mess with that? But. No, I haven't, but I probably should. I know Matt was doing yoga, right? Hot Yoga. We got to subtract girls to do the hot yoga. They say it's really, really good. Well, it's a great thing for your back. That's one of the reasons why I brought it up. It's amazing for like lengthening your spine. There's certain decompression exercises that you do in Yoga where you. You grabbed the bottom of your heels from underneath and you're pulling and straighten your legs out. You literally feel your back on like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Like I do it all the time and I can feel my back, especially in the middle. I feel it's separating and it makes it a little pop, almost like you're getting adjusted by a chiropractor. Is that something that you would recommend to your athletes? Is that something you might think about? If it's not an advantage, a disadvantage, anything of a person I want them to do now. What about, uh, other kinds of therapy, like a cold therapy, ice bass, cryotherapy, things like that.

Speaker 3:          01:25:40       Prolotherapy, stem cell, platelet injections. If you could think of it. I've done it. I wouldn't even get it. I don't want your cat and your readers to hear everything I've done because they would probably have me locked in.

Speaker 1:          01:25:52       Like what have you done that would have you locked up? I've used our stint and strict nine injections. What? Strychnine arsenic. Strychnine or arsenic and strychnine. Right. Why would they inject you with poison? Because it raises your red

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       blood cell count. I've used nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin cream because you know, in a stimulating blood flow and me start your heart up. Right? And I use it because I broke my back and I didn't want to admit I broke my back a second time. So I use it, I told my friend who was a professor at Ohio state that says, don't go nowhere. Well, we'll see what his does. I mean, I was raised and being for three hours, it felt like you were hit me in the head every, every heartbeat just hit me in a temple. And um, so, but I've done it all. There's nothing I haven't tried. I did electric statement, I think it was called a microwave. It lengthens out the muscles. I'm Tom did it for what? Fifteen seconds? I did for 96 minutes. What does it do? It lengthens out the muscles literally straighten out your leg right off the ground is electrocuting you.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       And uh, for six minute segments. And I did 96 minutes. So it's electrical muscular stimulation. It lengthens it. Yes. And I should never done it because I think I've got too many injuries, you know, and it basically tore. It popped my, uh, my hips and my shoulders out, his uncle. What if my hip don't? Six hour right here, my hipbone crazy here. Your whole body's like a walking medical encyclopedia. You know when you got to try it right now, I guess road warrior say desperate men do desperate things now. I'm very desperate. Hold from what's. What's worked the best for you? Did stem cells work out well for you? While I'm finding out because what has been about three weeks against stem cell in both hips and my knee and my shoulder. And what's wrong with your hips? Oh, there's some squatting ride. Just beating the crap out of myself.

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       It was all torn out. I'm shorten real wide. So all your parents are here for fighting, so it's just all wear and tear. And do you feel any different? So I think it's starting to work. See, I wasn't allowed to take anti inflammatories. I've been on an antiinflammatory. Nike's 1991 because uh, I didn't really die. See when I tore my knee off, I'm allergic to anesthesia so I went back in the beginning is fine. Yeah. So I went back in and gave me a shot to sort of calm me down for surgery, to take the wires out of my knees, out of my knee and it put me to sleep. He gave me on stages and they're getting trached why? Like I'm jumping around. There's ticket chest tubes in me. And that really, that's how I got the rest of that. They several, my intercostal nerves, they severed your intercostal nerve had at lh, five to five or six doctors telling me that's exactly what they did.

Speaker 3:          01:28:33       Only a chest tubes in me. So at that point, 91. Um, and, and I'm going to tell you about my gym and this is why the trade partners I had, I did step in 50. No one's ever done. And this is how, because I was in intensive care for about four days and I was in house with three more days and I got a, I didn't need a trake I could talk because I trained a. So they take my throat shut. He got ahold of this big. I got stitches in my side. They take me out of the hospital to the gym as well. Tuesday. But then suddenly I go to the gym and I go, I'll walk on crutches. He got money, you know, they find out and is you're maxing out, you know, motherfucker, and I says, what? They laid me down, I've been street 55. Who are they? Who's their trading partners? They're out of their fucking minds. Exactly. They tried to kill me, tried to kill him, and that's what you got to have. You've got to have people like that. They drove me to the point that when they told me that if I, if they told me they kicked me, I'm old jump. I didn't do it. Just tell me male the man. That's just so ridiculous. What a training.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       That is so ridiculous. Well, I understand your attitude now. You know, if you don't have an attitude, you don't have anything. I've had some great results with stem cells. Stem cells are probably going to help you quite a bit. You ever neck? No. Oh, okay. I just had it in my shoulder. I had it in my knee and my hip. But uh, the big one was my shoulder man, my shoulder, my hip. Was this a minor soreness and I was saying like do it preventative. And it definitely had an impact on it. My knee highs have an on and off pain for years. And my knee completely cured that up in my shoulder. It healed it like nothing I've ever done in my life. Wow. Yeah. Well I got for the break of needing shoulder surgery to no pain at all. Well this shoulder it gives out of place every freaking day.

Speaker 1:          01:30:23       And they got to put my. I separated my shoulder and say I got a big guy, puts it in everyday. So I'm hoping every day I could be put in everyday. What pops it out. Just strange. I mean just strained the ligaments, tendons, I think over the years. So it's not even anything you're doing physically, like not, not even lifting weights. It constant wear and tear, you know, I mean it's just like playing pro football, you know what I mean? But I'd done this for all those years. I mean, you know, I mean I was in, I was a nightmare record in 1971. Wow. And then um, so then, uh, 2000, three or four, whatever the eye and where it was, 2000, five percent, top 10. Wow. So do you do any exercise at all? Now? Trained this smaller crap. But when he goes to bed, I'd like to walk on tires.

Speaker 1:          01:31:07       I do belt squads. I had to quit because my knee was so bad, but I want to get back where I can deadlift. I love the deadlift, the deadlift. You don't just kick your ass. I mean if you can live you can still fight if someone attacks me. Right, right, right, right. Which is quite possible because the way you talk in his podcasts, get any a woman's ass eddie. Wow. That's amazing. Strong words. So like what, like when you lift weights today, like you, you lift in Max, are you maxing out or just getting some exercise? Because I been squatting and dead lift, just, you know, top dog squad right on, in my, almost my first meet. I mean when the neck, if you're going to pass out, you just have to, you know, comes a time. You just got stuff. Now when you're talking about doing the reverse hyper with that neck, a neck harness on, does that help you?

Speaker 1:          01:31:55       We actually do a bunch more supreme, a severe thing. We do neck, neck deadlifts, out of my belt squat machine with a neck harness. What's a neck deadlift? So you put up a net carbs on his machine and he squad over. You just stand up. Oh, so you're doing your deadlifts and just with your neck, with your neck, how much weight are you doing that with a on that machine where the machine weights? I've done about 40 pounds. Looks at the whole lot. Yeah, 40 pounds a lot to be hanging off of your neck. Yeah. Plus that. Plus the cage.

Speaker 1:          01:32:23       One hundred 95 pounds. Ninety five pounds. Are you still doing that? Yeah, it seems to make me feel better. It makes you feel better. It makes your neck feel better. Yeah. That's interesting because that would be like counterintuitive. A lot of people would think that a lot of people think you shouldn't lift any weights with your name, your neck. Like I talked to Kelly, started about it, you know that eight way neck machine, you know that thing he says, don't ever do that. It's bad for your neck. And then I've talked to other people who are athletes who were fighters, so it's one of the best things you could do for your neck. You got to in the NFL, the problem, they don't train their nickname or mira big. Everybody's neck was Russell. He was real big. What do you play? Football. You don't see that anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:32:59       It they neck is a the two most bomber of a piece of jewelry back in your neck. No one trains them because they're afraid to write. Well there. That's what I keep hearing that it's bad for your neck to lift weights with it, which seems so weird because it's not bad for your lower back to do dead lifts. It's not bad for your lower back to do like reverse hypers or Roman chair setups, ups or anything like that. And I think a guy called Paul and strong assumed never lived way back in the fifties, but he thought the neck was, was the most neglected muscles. And it shouldn't be the most used muscle cars. What happens to us, we have bad necks because if you don't do anything, we'll get bad neck. So do you think it's, it's a real issue with grapplers, like grapplers almost always get served cervical herniations.

Speaker 1:          01:33:43       Do you think that a lot of that could be prevented if you just strengthened up your neck? Yeah. Well, you know my print John Sader, I mean to this day, 67, he gets out and does neck bridges for five minutes and does $500 dollars qualities in 6,500 Hindus squats in a row at time. That's insane. He, that's what he does, that he gets out of bed. He does it every day, five minutes at neck bridge and $500 course. That's amazing that I could do them in a row and I could do $200. No, my fucking legs turned a rubber. I've got to step up my game. 500. Wow. And how old is he? I'd say 62 years. Sixty three busy on the shit. I don't know. You don't know? You don't ask him. Don't talk to older guys. Talk to about other bds to coach for seven years.

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       Oh, okay. That's. Well that's a big one for grappling a lot. A lot of old school grad course in particular. Love the Hindus Quans. But that's amazing that they can still do neck bridges and everything like that. And he's at that age. I mean he's a black belt in judo, Samo Jujitsu, black belt in Japanese. More time. He still trains. He trains all the time. Wow, that's amazing. He just had some miniature. He's but he's back now, but I think he can roll around a little bit. So. Wow. Hip Surgeries and a replacement or whatever. That's another real common one. Mark Coleman's got a hip replaced. Two. So common, a hip replacement. Um, everything else lasted. Hm. That's interesting. Way Pass everybody. Well, what they're hoping now is that through the use of stem cells that your body's going to be able to regenerate tissue and a lot of areas where it couldn't before and that's going to prevent a lot of replacements and a lot of surgeries and a lot of things. They think that sometime in the future that stem cell based therapies are going to eliminate a giant percentage of surgeries that people have. That's why I didn't know. I hope so too. I'm curious is if anybody's a canary in the coal mine to you will find that only time I get. Well I want to live. I want, I want deadly. I'm going to beat. And so you just want to deadlift till you drop. Yeah, that's what I do. I don't know. Anything else?

Speaker 1:          01:35:50       Well, is there anything else you want to say to all the people listening out here and. No, just no, just good luck and don't be afraid to try, you know, keep trying and never give up. People give up man and give up and no one should give up. Well listen man, you are a very unique character and I really appreciate you taking the time to sit down with me and do this and uh, I been wanting to talk to you for a long time and thank you so much for making that machine because that machine has helped me so much. It built so much strength in my lower back and gave me so much relief from a lower back issues that I had.
