I can't remember anybody's name anymore. There's so many people to remember. Yeah. Well she said, uh, she's onto her next chapter and that's how I feel too. Oh, it's going to be about how talking to women about how to raise functional sons. This isn't, this is needed in America and I'm going to step up and do it because all these tales.

Happen in fucking bitch in a moment. I'm old. I'm going to tell you what to do to raise decent sons. Women.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Well, your son said something when, when they were doing a little tour of the studio, they saw the picture of Rosa parks and your son said, that's Rosa parks. And I said, you're one of the few people that ever just pointed that out and noticed it. And he goes, of course he goes Roseanne's my mom. She raised me right.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       A suite in that suite. That's something that's getting the uh, what do you call it?

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       What is link? Know Pat on the back side of modern vernacular? I don't know. There's some slang. I hear him. I try to stay here, but I can't fucking do it. Well, you obviously did a great job. So shout out to shout out. Shout out to the moms. How you holding up everything good with you right now while I'm smoking like a bitch was every day was. Were you smoking before all this? Hell No. Well just currently, secretly doug. Stan hope got me back on him. The bastard you son of a bitch for like 15 years in Doug. Stan hope snuck every time I see doug, I'd smoke one that he's got an evil spell on me. Oh, he's evil little man. He's sober right now. No cigarettes for him either. Yeah. That he always says that. No, he's doing sober October. Are y'all doing sober October? Yes. Wow. Why did you ask me? I would've sobered up for it. No. No. You wouldn't have done it. No. I want to do a get fucked up on retox. Retox detox. That's what my boyfriend johnny calls it. Time to read talks about how many cigarettes are you smoking today? No. Well No. Who's counting? You just keep walking. I'm not smoking. Less than 10. Less than 10 is not bad. Yeah, not. It's not as smoking a lot. See, I'm cutting

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       it by 10 every week. So. So next week it'll be down to one day. All week days. Not Bad. And I'll see how I deal with it. If anyone dies,

Speaker 3:          00:03:16       this whole thing has been completely fucking insane and you have to tell you, but you caught this madness is outrage culture right at the peak. I think you. You hit peak outrage culture where people didn't give a fuck. If you were making a joke, didn't give a fuck. Have you had no idea that that lady was black? Didn't give a fuck what your mental state was. Didn't give a fuck if you were on Ambien, didn't give a fuck if you were drinking. Didn't give a fuck if you sincerely apologized. Oh, go ahead. I do want to talk. But they didn't care that you use sincerely apologized and did not. Didn't mean to offend. You were cracking a joke about a woman.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       It, it was funny how they've missed. Characterize it and lied about it and added words to it. But, um, yeah, I like talking about the tweet. But uh, yeah, I seriously apologize to all whom I inadvertently offended and because they were offended for it, it wasn't even what they say. They were offended because it didn't say that. But they think that I tweeted a said she looked like a, you know, somebody and I never said anything about her looks it was a political tweet and it's just proof of how everybody's under mass mind control because they took a um, and of course I'm always

Speaker 3:          00:04:46       interested in that. You know, you know, that I've talked to control. That's what I think. I think people are under the wave of self mind control. I don't think it's like there's anybody pulling the strings. You can get out of it. No, I don't think anyone's pulling the strings. I don't think this is. No, I don't. I don't think it's by design. I think people are caught up in a wave of fear and paranoia and political correctness. And I think one of the reasons why attack they attack someone like you is first of all, you're wealthy and successful and famous. You are beautiful. Thank you. And one of the best comics of all time. And you're also a, you're, you're an easy target. You're a white woman. Your identify as a white woman. What do you identify as? I identify as a Jew. Well, there you go and this is what you thought this woman was as well. What is their next? Like my cousin Sharon, she looks just like my cousin, but it wasn't nothing to do with how she looks that came after my tweet, but the busted about the point of her hands,

Speaker 2:          00:05:52       what she engineered in Iran and I'd been on there talking about the, the,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I call it a woman's revolution in neuron for years and speaking to people in Iran about it and what it means to, uh, the, the women who are second class citizens there. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       so if you take that one tweet out of like probably I tweet a lot. So I was probably 400,000. No, I don't go crazy. I stay crazy. I admit it. I mean, what the fuck? They're like, you know what you've said you're crazy for years and you know what, you're crazy. Well yeah, I set it for 15 years. Well it's also all of us are crazy. All comics are fucking nutso least I don't wash my keys like som. I know some guys, they got to wash their keys five, six, seven times where they can go on stage. What's his name? Oh, I'm so bad on names. Chris Farley. I always asked comics. You know, I asked him what's, what's your secret number? Which Years Joe? You don't have a number. You don't have to do something a number of times. You don't have a number. What's your birthday? Eight. 11, 67. Eight. What's that? August eight. Eleven 67. You were born in 1967? Yes. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Um, I was in my, I was in the Utah State Hospital. When you were born, what were you doing given birth? No, I was in a mental institution. That was my first hospitalization. It lasted for nine months and it was the Utah State Hospital in Provo where the osmonds are from. So it's was always a big Marie Osmond Fan. The, the mental health aspect of this conversation is an important one because here's my take on this. Extremely important. It is important. And yesterday was mental health awareness day. Yes, I know and I was quite aware of being mentally healthy yesterday as I was smoking. If someone, all I eat is cheese. If someone has a, an injured leg, you don't expect them to run marathons. If someone has a, you know, something wrong with their liver, you don't expect them to process food correctly. You don't blame it on them, but if someone has a mental health issue and they do something erratic or they say something that's inappropriate and then they apologize for it. Or if they're Canadian or if they're a comedian and you, you've had the gitelman real diagnosed, treated mental health issues, trauma related issues. There you go. How'd you like that? It's a little bit better. Kenya. Yeah, but for whatever reason, people to pretend that this

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       is a deliberate act by calculating person who is just being an asshole and that's not the case. You're not an asshole at this time. I have been an asshole. But you weren't there but you weren't. That's not what you were doing now. I was talking about Iran and the woman's revelation there and how, uh, how, and it's always been because, you know, what I had my dna done because I wanted to know and I am of North African ancestry, how much. It's like a very small percentage, but it was something like 25,000 years ago they left North Africa which has kind of Syria and they went to Lithuania and I'm Russia and uh, some Europe to July 23 and me or someplace and just answered so many questions for, you know, why I feel this yearning towards that part of the world. But I do, you know, and especially the geopolitics there, some have always intrigued me and I have always attempted to use my voice to um, you know, support all of the people there. Well, it's fast. So it was, you know, this one tweet was like about. It was about,

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       I mean, it's actually a genius tweet if you really fucking knows what exactly did you say it was? Find the tweet, Jamie, I'll tell you if it's a artificially rendered because an artificially rendered one. There's a lot of them were people distorted what you actually said it was racist Roseanne, and then a couple of weeks later it was disgraced comic Roseanne and her racist tweet and then after that it was disgraced comic can her offensive racist tweet because there's all these hoops you gotta jump through, you know, they're never done punishing you. Well, look were saying before all my friends said, don't apologize to social justice warriors because that's the kiss of death. That's like chum in the water, blood in the water, you know? It's definitely a little bit of that. But what I was saying before, the podcast to use, I don't, I don't really.

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       What I really think happens is they find a target and they don't care if it's a viable target, but once the target gets greenlit, they go after you until some new target comes along until only distraction. That target. Yes, sure. It's recreational outrage. They find the attack you and they go after you and they to what the fuck you said and obviously they don't. That's what kind of cracks me up. It's like, Hey, look at this. Look what they're saying and that meant, and you know, I'm not going to bow down before them and say you were right and they want me to, but they weren't right. I'm right. I wrote it bitch, so I know what I meant, so you don't get to tell me what I meant, but they don't care. The thing is they don't want to look at it rationally and say, Oh, here's a woman that has a history of mental health problem.

Speaker 2:          00:12:05       She was on Ambien and drinking and she says something that is slightly irrational, but given your explanation of it, well you did. She was black dog. Both Ali think all my tweets make no sense. You have been saying that for fucking here since I went on twitter. You're like, her tweets are just buttoned straight up crazy. Have some crazy tweets for sure. I don't think they're crazy. You just don't get 'em. Well, maybe if I was in the same mindset as you, I would get them. Yeah, but obviously no one is. When I say crazy, I think they don't think like other people. I know that I've always known that my whole life I'd always test other people, see what they were thinking like as even as a kid I'd be like, but I try to fit in. They go play barbies, you know, and I'm like, fucking, I don't want to. And I'm like, okay, well let's have Barbie be a resistance fighter that paratroops into, you know, into the hidden lines of the German thing and save all the Jews. And they'd go, you have to be her cousin skipper. Then they'd hand me the skipper doll. I always had to personify skipper and they got to be Barbie. I didn't even know a Barbie. Had a cousin. Yeah. Skipper. She has a little tiny tits and I resented that because I always had very large pendulous breasts since I was four or five.

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       I did. I, I don't think or look like other people. I think I'm an alien. Really. What planet you think you'd be from? Um, well, somebody told me as from the eighties. Do you know anything about that? Yeah, that's the people that call the art bell show. They would always say that they say round faces are from Pat. You see you got a round face. That's what I told you. I don't even go by what people look like except for I do look at the shape of their head. I have to admit that's how I classify people. I classified people my own way because I don't think like everybody else thinks I take a person shape of their head and that's that group they represent to me and I have noticed that the Dutch have the largest heads people, the Dutch have pure score. Not all of them of course, but some of them you're the average height for a Dutch person, like six feet tall. I know women vikings. Yeah. Biking. I love all the different peoples of the earth because they all have a variety of foods that I enjoy. So I like to, you know, I don't just mix with one kind of person in my real life. I'm mixed with all kinds of people and you know, because I'll go anywhere for free meal, but I. But I love, I love cultures and I love

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       all people. That's all. I want to say, you know, I would never, I'm not that person, so you're not a racist by any stretch of the imagination, but you are a person that I am a misanthropy. I'm a misanthrope misanthrope, but I am a respect truss of no man or woman, but most comedians, yeah, we're all like that, right? Misanthropic intentions or you have to hate all people the same, but you definitely have to mock and make. I mean, it's part of your job description to mock and make fun of and you, you look for things that are irritating about everything. No Shit. Right? That's part of the job and not only that, that was part of your character on your show was part of the reason why ABC wanted you back. It's part of the reason why the show became such a giant hit and it's returned.

Speaker 3:          00:15:38       I mean, it was a fucking huge hit coming right out of the gate. Yep. Twenty 8 million people. That's a lot of fucking panel number one. Every episode. Yeah. That's a lot of people and a lot of that was because people love this aspect of you, but as soon as you get labeled a racist, everybody throws their hands up. It goes, Whoa, I didn't know she was racist. She's racist, and they don't care about nuance. They don't care about the details. They don't care about ambien. They don't care about alcohol. When I called you on the phone was the first thing that I think I've learned gel well, if you're gonna, take an ambien down. Not do not drink a beer. Always only drink a wine. Yes, with Ambien. I have a good friend of mine who is one of the nicest, most respectful guys you ever want to meet.

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       He woke up in Germany on a plane, covered in his own vomit with the police, standing over him, asking him if he knew what happened. He ended up getting arrested. They brought him to the jail in Germany and they add and he's a ceo of a large company and they went over things with him and they said, what happened? What do you remember? He goes, well, I remember taking an Ambien and then then I went to sleep and then I had a, I guess I had a beer at some point in time and they go, okay, stop. This is what happened, and so they described how he was hitting on the stewardesses and trying to start fights with men in the cabin and wasn't as being as real. Selfie was on. Ambient distorts. He's the nicest guy. If you knew this guy, you would never in a million years believed that he was capable of anything remotely like this and the German people actually let him stay in the country.

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       They let him continue his vacation. They're like, okay, for gay family promise not to do that again. He goes, I'm never fucking taking that shit again in my life, and one of the things that I said to you when I called you up, I said, what were you doing well? And you told me you were on Ambien, and I said, okay, we'll stop right there because I know quite a bit about that because I've had personal experiences with friends that have had real issues with ambien. I had a bit I did in my act about a friend of mine who literally made a meal while he was on Ambien cooked at the supermarket, what God

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       food look at Tiger Woods that he was on that and then he'd go driving off in the golf cart to meet some check, you know, g and that I don't understand where people said they had sex on Ambien. People say that's a big thing that people take ambien to have sex. I don't even know how they can stay at. I guess they don't stay awake, but another part of them wakes up and their sex part comes out. That's all I can figure.

Speaker 3:          00:18:16       I've never taken it. I'm terrified of the song ever take. Yeah. I, I get. Nope. I have no problem going to sleep. I've never had.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       I do, but you know, what I found is thc. They sell it down at uh, the dispensary and there's one for sleep at night. And um, I've been doing that and I, I've been sleeping through the night when I was taking the sleeping thing, the sleep and drug ambien. Well, I don't want to say it because we don't want to get some candy, man. You don't want to say it three times. You don't get sued. Not

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       say an Ambien. I bet you they give a fuck. Did you see their choice? They said, I didn't see that today. Do you see that? Yeah. Well, you know, I had Hamilton Morris on the podcast who is a drug expert and he. He writes for advice and it does a piece for vice and he went into the advice after your incident. He came on and went in great detail about how that. That is something that happens to people that were. They have no idea what the fuck they're saying. It's called a hypnotic. That is the classification of drugs that it falls under and people do all sorts of involuntary things when they're on it. No, it doesn't just make you say racist things, but you didn't say anything intentionally racist. No.

Speaker 2:          00:19:30       About the work of Valerie Jarrett's hands and I also was referencing my very favorite movie. So if we could talk about how fucking awesome that movie planet of the Apes Great fucking movie. It's the definitive people get your come on people now. It's like, come on. It's like the hundredth monkey. Is that the thing? Is that the name of it? That's what it is. 100 monkey on the typewriter. They write up those monkeys. What is it? How is that work that if you have a certain amount of monkeys, the hundredth monkey that changes everything, right? If, if a, if a species does something 99 times in a row, the hundredth time it's gotten into their DNA. Oh yeah. Yeah, and then they evolve to the next level.

Speaker 3:          00:20:18       Hundredth monkey effect or just monkey effect is a hypothetical phenomenon. Which new behavior ideas co claim to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups. Once a critical number of members of one group exhibit a new behavior or acknowledged that new idea. Yeah. Yeah. Well the thing is a lot of people put pictures of that woman right next to the lady picture.

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       I understand the picture was put up after my tweet. I understand, but I am not going to do with that. I didn't say she looked like anything real seriously. I'm not that fucking shallow. Okay. I never talk about nobody's looks unless they're thin and blonde and I'm jealous, but you know, and youthful now but or whatever. But wasn't there another tweet that you made a long time ago about? Who was that other woman? Susan Rice? Yeah. Well you said she has giant swing eight balls that she's a man. Let me explain that now because this is the regional listic regionalism. I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah when we got married and are we heard our moms do it too. It's always, where's your ape? They go, what? You're doing this Sunday it. And he's like, oh, he's watching football. All good. Let's go out to lunch, you know, is all, all of the men were all apes.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       That's how it is in a breeder culture, like Salt Lake City, breeder cheerleader culture. So it's like, where's your ape? And was like, man, you're a passive big fucking swing and eight balls. I give them that, you know, it's a regional, holistic thing. And uh, you know, so I used it and apologize, but you know, because I didn't realize, you know, I just sometimes forget what race everybody is as if I could tell half the time anyway, I can't even see people that tell you the truth. I need like bifocals trifocals and I never identified other human beings by what they looked like for God's sake. I just could tell if I felt a liking to him. You know, whatever they looked like. Point is the only two things over the course of thousands of don't mess my point. I said, Susan Rice, let's say that she has, she has incredible audacity. That's what I meant. And she does. But you didn't mean it in a complimentary way.

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       If someone is audacious, is that negative or positive? You weren't you talking about her in a negative way though? I said she has a lot of audacity. That's what I meant. She does whatever it was that was, that was one that got brought up as well. That was also in the middle of a huge conversation about, you know, Ben Gazi and the Iran deal. Those are the two things are two of the three things that I like to do on twitter, although I'm no longer on there. Yeah. For you. Yeah. I was glad to see Kanye west got off to. Yeah, he deleted all his account last week and I was glad to because you're just like, once you're a target it's just too painful. Well definitely shouldn't be reading that shit. No, I don't read it. But um. Well, when

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       you become a target, how do you know if you don't read it?

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       Well, I know what I've lived through when it first happened and that's been like four or so months ago, so I just know how I've reacted in my real life since that happened to me. How long for things die off to die off?

Speaker 3:          00:24:04       What do you slow down where they weren't just coming after you constantly, like I told you that news crews, when they found out that you were going to come on the podcast the first time they were trying to show up at my house, they were trying to show up at the studio. They were trying to find me at the comedy store. I mean they were just trying to hunt down anything about you.

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       I know I'm snake and segues from my boyfriend because we were at my mom's house when I did it. You know what we were at home in Salt Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11 AM. I just woke up and I had this thought in my head, oh my God, this can make so much sense. And then I tweeted it and I went right back to sleep and when I woke up at seven, the shit had hit the fan, you know? Yeah. But I was like, I'm going to expound on this later. That was one of those kinds of things, right. You just want to get it down. And I, you know, always slept with my computer and tweet. When I wake up like one year old, you have to go to the bathroom a lot. So I always tweet and fall back to sleep. See? And then on the ambient tweets, my daughter, I used to always, when I took my Ambien, I call my daughter and she or she called me. She goes, mom, you, you're starting to do the Ambien tweets. Get off, get off the twitter, you know. But uh, I saw, I just called my daughter. Then every night when I, when I was doing the Ambien and I'd go, you know what, here comes a big fish. She recorded it. Here comes a big fish right through my window. All he's getting stuck in the mirror and should, that's for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:25:33       He goes, mom turned it all off and go to sleep. I have to have my family telling me that because it almost need her standing guard by your bed. Hold on, let me read that before you tweet it. No, no, no, no, it doesn't. Now

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       she don't. She took my twitter account away. We'll use tweets. All these liberal things that I want to get just get up in her face and smack around for no on her own. And I'm like, well how come it's okay for you to say this? But it ain't for me. Well mother, I didn't lose everything. Oh, she's trying to help you. I'm like, AH, yeah. You and your fucking hell

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       sticks it in your face. Is your issue serious? Liberal? Are

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       they all. All three of my daughters are serious social justice warrior types. And what did they think about your position as well? They think I'm a frigging correct. They think I'm crazy. They always did like, you know, they always thought all my choice for president were crazy. But then oddly they were all very supportive when I personally ran for president in 2012. They were really supportive of me. Then you're their mom. Yeah. That was cool. But like all other times it's like, Oh god, mother, it's your generation. The baby boomers are the reason everything is all fucked up. So stop letting yourself pop back up.

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       Conversations in the bar. Household. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. What, what was it that when you first got brought into a mental hospital, what was it about?

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       Well, I had got hit by a car and the, uh, the hood ornament went in my head and my brains and scramble them and I, I used to be an a plus math student. I was just great in geometry. Oh my God, I loved geometry. I got straight a's and then, you know, I sort of fell apart after that. Took a long time to heal from it. And um, you know, uh, how much did you personality change? Oh, it changed drastically, but you know, you read all that stuff about a traumatic head injuries now because I do read a lot and talked to a lot of football players who have the same thing and we do discuss it. Yeah, you change right away. Yeah, it's still you, but it's like a,

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       it's kind of like an artel artificial intelligence. You do you find that, did you find that you became much more impulsive?

Speaker 2:          00:28:02       Oh yeah. I, well, yeah. Here's what happened. I was crossing the street on my way to school. How old were you? I was 16. No, it's 15. Go on to first week of high school and uh, I was a big nerd and anyway, uh, was crossing the street and it was a top of the hill and this woman girl, she was on her way to the university and the sun blinded her and she ran me over. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:28:47       the rest is history. How, how long were you in the hospital for [inaudible]? So first you must have been, you must have been in a medical hospital first and then you were admitted to a mental hospital after about three months in between. Right? Uh, but I was in the hospital for awhile, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       and uh, I had a head concussion and a brain concussion and I had hamburger, meat for legs. So they did all these, um, what do they call them? Skin grafts on my legs. A and m? Yeah. I was in there for awhile. Then I came out of there and I had forgotten everything about math when I returned to school where it's a matter of weeks after that, maybe two months. So I'm really bad on time now. But uh,

Speaker 1:          00:29:40       and I had forgotten all my math and it was just terrible. That was a big depressive depression I went into because I couldn't remember. I couldn't remember things, you know? And also I became way more impulsive. Then I was like, I don't know what I did. Then I started going really out there into the ethers. I went way out there. Like how so way out, you know, how you go way out. Do you ever go away out? Not really. I've had a lot of head injuries. Oh yeah. I've been but not terrible. Mostly just punches and kicks, nothin like car accidents or never played football, but my head injuries have, you know, there were just more of a cumulative when I was young, until I was about 21, 22. I stopped, stopped fighting, stop sparring,

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       but nothing. But uh, definitely

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       I'm subject to impulsive behavior. Stealing. Yeah. But I can't keep it under wraps. I keep it under control because I'm aware of it. But when I was younger I didn't understand what was going on. I would just be subject to whims, very addictive behavior. But I've tried to keep it positive, but it would be addicted to things, addicted to doing things, addicted to games, addicted like ridiculously addictive, like spend 10, 12, 14 hours a day playing video games. That kind of shit. My Kid. Yeah. Well it's just normal because video games are awesome. But yeah, it would be for me to be everything, martial arts, pool, whatever do is I'll just be completely obsessed with it and be thinking about it all day in port where it wasn't necessarily healthy. And just on a whim I would just want to go do something. I just, I almost had no control over compulsion's, you know, and I think some of that is it. Whatever brain injuries that I've had are very mild in comparison to a lot of people that I know, certainly very mild in comparison to yours.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       But there was a lot of trauma in the state hospital that, you know, I'm like, you know, being there and seeing and experiencing. And how long did that for nine months.

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       So what was it that they brought you in there for? What was, how were you behaving that they decided that you needed to be admitted?

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       I was out there. You say that like, what does that mean?

Speaker 4:          00:32:03       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       I don't think there's any words. The English you just can't understand, didn't have a control of reality. You didn't have control of your behavior. Your thinking was screwed up. I was, you know, not thinking like the normal thing that they say you should be thinking about and, but people round you had realized it,

Speaker 3:          00:32:25       that it was, it was so bad that they had to admit you to a hospital. It wasn't just A. Oh, Rosanne. She's eccentric. It was. She needs

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       actual medical help. Yeah. I asked to be admitted. Do you knew something was really wrong? She

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       finally admitted it was. Did you know at the time were you completely aware that it was connected to your car accident?

Speaker 2:          00:32:47       Uh, no.

Speaker 3:          00:32:49       You just knew something was wrong. Yeah. And back then they didn't really kind of understand that the way they understand it now,

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       no, they didn't understand too much about bipolar disorder or they knew nothing about multiple personality disorder. Trauma related trauma related. Yeah. PTSD, now they call everything pts. Yeah. They don't even say d anymore. They say pts post traumatic stress.

Speaker 3:          00:33:18       So when they admitted you, what was the treatment like? What did they do to you when you were inside the mental hospital?

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       Well, they right away put me on an anti psychotic. What was it? Do you remember? Mallory? What did that do? I don't know. I wasn't there. You weren't there. You were gone. I was gone. I was just watching these people. I was in the mental institution width and I wanted to tell that story because there was this one lady. I think I told this to Paul reubens too. I think it might be worried. Got Large Marge. But there's this one lady and she's in this cage. No, she's in a cage with keys on our ward there. And uh, uh, Christ, I can't remember her name either. Marge, her name was march. Yeah. And she's about 600, 700 pounds. And uh, she is funnier than hell, you know, I thought, man, this, this chick's got smooth lines, you know, and I, it's traded lines with her and she'd laugh. You know, you know, I was like jokes, you can always find a job wherever you are, you know, that's the key to life I think. But um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       so she, oh, everybody called me junkie. That was my name Chunky. And uh, there was another girl in their name shorty, so it was chunky and shorty where you were like a duo, but anyway, um, so she's like, hey, Roseanne, get what's her name's keys when they go to dinner and open this up here and you know, come in here. I'm like, okay, you know, cause, you know, after all I was crazy too. And uh, I don't trust it. I don't know, I just always, I never questioned that there was danger anywhere. I always got in trouble, you know, got beat up something, you know. But uh, so I did it, you know, and I can't all cut. That was her name, the head nurse. I hated her because she told me I needed a baby. I'll tell that story later. It was horrifying. It changed my life. But anyway, so they all go to dinner. So I go in there and steal the keys out of the thing where they are, you know, the attendance and not go in there with marge and leave the keys in the door and close the door. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:35:50       So I'm like, hey mark, how's it going? Margin.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       And she's like, chunky. You know why they put me in this cage? Don't you take some draggers everywhere I go, well, why? No, I don't know why. Well, chunky because they consider me to be dangerous.

Speaker 5:          00:36:22       I'm like, how come I am? I'm like Gomer pyle, serious

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       play and I'm total gold when you're like 16 at the time. 15 about eight minutes into it I realized, Oh shit. Oh Shit, something's going on here. That's how long it always took me to like zero in, on what's happening because I'm not even there, you know? I'm always ignoring when other people talk. I don't listen to me, you know? So I'm always in my own head. I never get out really except for when I work. But uh, so uh, then it got done. It took a turn, you know, she's like, so it got to a why do they consider you dangerous? You know, I had to ask it because she kept on getting me there to that point where she wanted me to ask it. I was trying to delay it, you know, because I knew they'd be back in 40 minutes and it was like going on 20 now she goes, I'm in here because that's my voice. I got to do margin. I'm in here because I broke a couple attendants backs and they tell you that.

Speaker 5:          00:37:41       No

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       My. How'd you do that? And then my head, I'm thinking, don't change. Don't miss a beat. Don't miss a breath. Don't look nowhere. Just to keep on Ecmo. You know, Utah, your dog girl. She knew she was dangerous. Well that's when it hit my head that it was, oh, she's talking about, you know, I'm a, I'm feeling like pray, right. You know, and I go, how'd you do that? Because I'd figured out, oh, it's an accident. You know, it's good. All Marge, she tells good jokes. She goes, well, it's easy. You just know I'm doing me again. I got to do her. It's easy. You just put one hand here and one hand here and then you're like, oh, oh

Speaker 6:          00:38:35       hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Where'd you learn that? I'm changing the subject and 100. How was your mom? What was the school like? You went to. What's your favorite book? What's your favorite color? What kind of ice cream you like? You ever seen that there's worms in the oatmeal. You ever noticed that she started? That one. Got Her. She's like, yeah, I did a good notice. I was crawling motherfuckers. I go, yeah, next week. Does the effect that this shoe, this one, you know, I like suddenly I'm transported to a confederacy of dunces when he's on the thing of, against Levi pants. You remember that rant in that book? So I'm just tap dancing really? And uh, then I hear it click. Fuck man. I grabbed, I got fumbled the keys out of the door, put them back in the uh, attendance room went my room.

Speaker 2:          00:39:33       When you said you hear click. Yeah, I knew the first door got opened. There was two doors that I heard the first door open. They're coming back from, from dinner. So you got away from us, be sick, you know, in my room. That's why I didn't go to dinner. Yeah. So Ms Dot lay in there. And that was like daily. I mean there were so many weird people in there. We had this one girl, Rosie, her name was where she'd always grabbed. She always ended up with a pair of sharp scissors and lunch for someone's throat. We're like, where'd you get them? Who's bringing her them scissors, you know? But anyway, I went on an anti psychotic medicine and um, that was good that I was on there for the Shit I saw. Now when you say any my friends hanging and stuff like that. Sorry, friends hanging in the mental institution.

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       So I saw worse than that. Would you say hi? I saw, you know, victims of abuse was terrible by the guards. Know, have kids coming in know victims of abuse that came in that were mentally scarred by that. Yeah. Yeah. Now when they put you on anti psychotics, was it because you were exhibiting psychotic behavior? What kind of psychotic behavior? While they thought it was psychotic high was just scared that they. I think I was throwing them off because I want to think. I was like, got it. I didn't want to think them to think I was schizophrenia. I knew enough not to let them near me that if [inaudible] once you got the, uh, once you got the diagnosis of schizophrenia they would just shocks and they experiment on, you're basically, you're in Guinea pig and I didn't want that, so maybe I, you know, and then you know, so yeah, I was doing weird things like walking down the middle of streets after I hit by the car, I walked down the middle of the streets. I don't know, I thought, Oh, you got to get over your fear of crossing the streets. That's what was in my head. And then I'd walk down the highway, you know, I was in a whole other realm. It was like a real surrealistic and metaphysical realm and I grew comfortable there. But, you know, I think most artists, writers and performers are in that world. I mean, we've got a toe in it, at least I've gone in and out, you know, depending on, you know, now I think I'm on the right medications. That helped me.

Speaker 3:          00:41:57       Um, there's a lot of comedians that have similar stories, you know, some of the grades, you know, Kinison as a similar story to, you know, he was hit by a car and change changes personality radically. And it happened in a similar age. It happened when he was young as well. And he was one person and then you get hit by a car. And then after the car he was just wild man. Wild didn't give a fuck. Well, totally impulsive,

Speaker 2:          00:42:19       but I didn't give a fuck it. So I just thought different, thought, different. I was just, um, I don't know, my mom says when I was 18 months old, I used to go out in the street and direct cars. We lived on a highway and uh, you know, that, uh, she'd come and find me there just 18 months. All the holding up my hands, Jesus Christ, stop in traffic. It's always had a weird thing going there. But uh, you know, I don't know. I think I watched too much of that police show, you know, where they'd stopped traffic. I used to love TV shows and think they were real.

Speaker 3:          00:42:58       Some of it. But how many people do you think know this about your mental health history? You know, anybody who knows me, I don't think very many people know what, that we're angry you. Oh yeah, they did. I don't think they did. Yeah, they did. I don't think people look past the surface. I think they looked at you as a rich white lady who said something that they considered to be racist and they decided they were going to attack you. And then the perception, the optics of this is the reason why ABC canceled the show. The reason why was ABC, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's the reason why they canceled the show is the reason why everybody pulled back away from you. And what did that feel like when nobody defended you? People who should know you the way I know you and I defended you from the very beginning because I said, look at my son told me I might.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       Thank you. This is not a racist person. I go, this is a woman who's kinda crazy. He's brilliant. Hilarious. Fun To be around. Yes. It was one of the reasons why I love you. Well, you know, they try to outlaw comedy. That's what I. Well I was surprised that more comics didn't say nothing because you know, they, I don't know, they're scared. People are scared. They're scared to support someone that they considered to be racist, you know? I mean, I got a lot of shit from it, but I don't give a fuck. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't think what they want and call me what they want. It don't change me. It doesn't change you. Well it just takes time before the dust settles. And I knew that once I knew that once you and I talked, if you and I sat down and talked like this, people get a chance to see who you really are, you know? Well,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       you know, they might not like me, I don't have to know. They don't. You're not a bad person, you've never been a bad person. I'm not a bad person, but I've done bad things and like I was talking to, uh, you know, I'm a name dropper. I hate to drop his name out, but forgive me, I should have asked him first, but you know, I was talking to Mike Tyson, you know, and uh, he's been through some stuff and uh, you're like, well, the thing is you gotta you gotta become a pacifist. That's, that's your only.

Speaker 3:          00:45:13       Yeah. Don't battle with people who don't know. I can't battle with people back and forth online. You know what I mean? Um, there's too many people, there's not enough time and you'll go crazy. You'll get wrapped up in conflict and you'll just be involved in it every minute of every day.

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       Yeah. I call it feeding the beast. Yeah. Because that really is tower of Babel, twitter.

Speaker 3:          00:45:35       Well, it's, it's definitely a strange, strange environment where all these people are just, they don't even know you. They have no contact with you other than your this person they could reach and get to react to certain lines and the more explosive and the more derogatory and insulting the lines they say to you, the more impact it's gonna have on you so that flavors the way they communicate with you.

Speaker 4:          00:46:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:46:01       Yeah, it was. It was tough working with a lot of social justice warriors and remake. It was tough on me mentally.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       So when you mean like the staff that you were working

Speaker 2:          00:46:13       with? Luck. I was the only one saying I'm not a Republican. Dora my fucking Democrat. I'm an independent and I'm just anticorruption. I'm just anticorruption don't, don't make me into what your idea of who I am. What was that idea who you were and. Well, they thought that since I supported president trump or that I was, you know, a racist and a scumbag and you know, anti everything just because I voted for him. Why did you support trump?

Speaker 2:          00:46:50       I love what Norm Macdonald said. If I can quote him, can I quote says it better than anything. He said the American people. I hated hillary so bad that they voted for a guy. They hate it even worse. Just don't rub it in. That is normal Mcdonald. That's brilliant. But you know, I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't for Hillary and I was a woman and that was like a big. No, no, right. That's Alec basically down to because it was a woman's turn. But, you know, I'm, I, I just want a government that works for the American people, the Ta. I pay taxes and I expect something for my taxes and, you know, here's news to all of them out there, including poultice. Uh, I think at some time the American people need to audit what happened to their tax monies and I think we should all have a say in what this country does with our hard earned dollars. And uh, don't just assume you speak for us because obviously you don't or we wouldn't have a trade deficit of $20,000,000,000,000. So stfu and, uh, let the American people handle what they should handle in this country. It's a republic and it's a runs on the, uh, on the consent of the governed. And it's really, really time to talk about that

Speaker 3:          00:48:25       now. When you say social justice warriors that you had to work with specifically, what were the issues that you were dealing with?

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Well, trump was the big elephant in the room. My support for trump and they're just, they're patronized. Scheidt can I call it? Yeah, well we have to remember that the. I mean I'm going to paraphrase, but it was a lot. Well, you know, the ignorant unwashed people who voted for trump, it's not their fault. That was Kinda what it was like. And uh, because I said, well, you know, it was working class people that elected trump. So I, I really can't, I can't let you say that to me because it's not true, you know, they already had in their head what it means. And of course they are wrong. Like they're wrong about this being about, you know, the cabinet being about abortion rights or wrong about that too. So, you know, they're wrong about that because I don't think, you know, he said pretty much that, you know, you can't overturn something that's in law Roe versus Wade. Yeah. But you know, they fear mongered to get everybody thinking that's what they were after and I don't think it is what they were. I don't think that is why they wanted to. I think they're concerned with anything that trump is trying to pass

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       anyone that trump's trying to get to the supreme court in any bills

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       they should put on their adult pants and get involved and make sure that he represents, you know, the will of the people of this country. You have to become involved in the process then, but don't just sit there on your butt criticized and everybody and calling everybody names that, that's really not any kind of a justice warrior. That's all phony. You got to get involved right

Speaker 3:          00:50:20       now. When you were first approached about doing a Rosanne, the relaunch, when they came to you, how did this all take place and did you get to pick the people that you work with?

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       Um, I had already said about a year prior to that that I supported trump over hillary. And it was like, you know, a big. It was in all the papers in Hollywood, how, how could she and, you know, this and that and the other, but it didn't seem to bother the American people outside of my audience. Well, you know, I always try to make content for the audience, not for the critics. Right. And enough for the industry, not for the industry. Now the industry is ruthlessly left, like to the point where it's not even a thinking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:51:09       It's just like they automatically go left because that's the way you're accepted in this town. That's the way you stay working. That's the way you stay invited to all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       That's the way that certain Stalinist types in show business. Keep it, you know, uh, you know, everything about the media is tightly controlled in Hollywood. So when they came, who came to you with the relaunch? How did it, how like how does it happen? That was an era where they did a sketch on Sarah's talk show and everyone liked it. And Sarah called me and said, she said, John said he's in, if you, you know, if you're in. So you say Johnson of course is Lori. Yeah, Lori's in. Okay. Uh, yeah, let's do it. So what, who turned on you after this was over

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       while I'm my covenant of lawyers, Advisors. I not get into this at this time. That's, you know, I think it's self explanatory where people could find out. Yeah, I don't know that they turned on me. I think it was always that way since, you know, I came in and said, I said no, somebody on the show has to be a trump supporter. None of them would do it. I'm like, it's a great role. You know, you could do it. You're the kind of person who wouldn't. And they were like, no. So I said, okay, well then I'll do it because, you know, I did vote for him. Every knows it. Well people forget archie bunker. It's one of the greatest characters in the history of sitcoms. Nobody wants to be the quote unquote, you know, other, the bad person, the bad guy in Hollywood or you know, be the other in Hollywood. But, you know, I, I was up for it. I thought it would be great. I thought it would be, you know, I get some lines in there from the other side once in awhile, you know, I, I let him say all they want to say. I never told them don't say that about him, don't this and that, like the day of the filming, you know, I'd been saying, you know, I let my writers do their Brighton, you know, but I lay out all the stories or approve them, you know. And uh, so

Speaker 2:          00:53:35       it was that first show and I'm waiting for a line about hillary. I go, I let you have seven trump jokes in this show. And you came in one fucking Hillary. Joe Didn't want hilary joke. Now what was the hilary joke? Do you remember? I said, you better get me a hilary joke. I did. I go, it ain't about you, your name and on this shit. What did they say about it? Like why did they not want to hilary joke? Did they have an explanation for it? No, but everybody knew they wanted Hillary. Yeah. They felt it would go against their morals to say that there's another way to vote or to acknowledge that you know, half the country voted that way or that she's extremely flawed. Well, that point they didn't care. That's what's weird about it, isn't that the whole thing's weird. There's a complete denial of reality like this is not.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       There's nothing to do with women as nothing to do with liberals. That is another. You're talking about an extremely flawed person. Well, I don't. I'm not going to talk about her as a person. I just talk about her concepts and her voting record. Not even use the word person, politician. Extremely flawed politician with a background of deep corruption and lies. Demonstratable lies like this. We're not talking about some amazing gem, you know. Well, let's just put it like this. A lot of us people who liked Bernie voted for trump. Yes. I'll put it like that. Yeah. Well, especially when they found out when Donna Brazile's book came out and they found out what they had done to Bernie during the primaries. Yeah. It's dark shit. Yeah. It's dark that, that just everybody's like, whatever. Whatever they said, nobody will vote for a Jew, they'd use that one.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       It's hilarious in the cell to this day, to this day, they're still doing stupid shit like that. But that, you know, I didn't want her even though she is a woman, but you know, uh, I did want her in 2008. I wanted to her, not Obama because I liked her healthcare plan better at that time when I was still, you know, before I walked away. So, um, you know, they're doing a whole march. I might show up a march for what? Walk away, walk away from what the Democrat Party, who is they, who's doing this and a whole bunch of kids, youth. And what's the ID number? Twenty seven that the cross from the White House. They're going to walk from the DNC to that park there and make statements, but walking away to wear to an independent party. Terrian. They're going Republican,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       Republican. That's what's bizarre. The polar opposites. The right and the left, the blue and the red

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       and all those guys golf together. Let's get to cut through the bullshit. They're all making deals. And scratching each other's back, whether from one party or the other. Come on. Well, trump

Speaker 3:          00:56:40       paid Clinton to be at his wedding. He did? Yeah. Wow, that's smart. He got a photo op and a half out of that one. I mean, he paid those people forever. It's one of the reasons why when, when he was campaigning, he had so much animosity towards them and towards the system that he was a part of for so long. He was a democrat most of his life.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       I know. Well, he's getting the. He's getting it too. But uh, that just proves it right there. You know, they give money to both parties. You know, in Hollywood, they don't just get to the Democrat party because the Republican Party to. But they stay silent about that. Well, it's Kinda smart duck cover your at bats, you know, which government contractor couldn't be able to dip into. And isn't that like what Hollywood is really all about?

Speaker 3:          00:57:30       Well, there's so many levels to it, right? I mean, there's the blatant tribalism of right versus left where people pick a side and they adopt a predetermined pattern or behavior and they adopt a conglomeration of ideas and the program. Yes. Yeah. And they're just bought. Exactly. They pair it ever. And then below the surface he got geo political aspirations. And you have the, the global war machine. Yeah. Yeah. Um, that's, that's what you have the money, the real money.

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       But you know what Joe, I always say when people call me a, a, a whatever they call me, but I have optimism and I've said for a long time when the right people are at the controls of all the machinery and technology that will be so great for humanity. We have the right within our grasp to, you know, make sure that this is a good place for all kids. We could do that tomorrow. So I think we should start thinking about that and all this artificial intelligence that gets us fighting with each other. Let's just step out of it like the Matrix, you know, let's go to a new place where we're about solutions and working together and bringing this country together and getting some real good jobs, real good health care. Things that we pay taxes for better streets, good education. The things we pay taxes for.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Yeah. And mental health. Most of all, I think that's what we need to protect for our veterans. They come back and they're, they're untreated and they won't even give him marijuana, which really helps. They weren't even legalized that for, you know, people who have pts and marijuana does help with pts and uh, you know, you know, talk about supporting our troops. Twenty two of them a day are killing themselves. They're homeless. I mean that, that's who we are. I don't want that to be who we are. Come on. They'd people think nobody can see us and we do, but they do and they, they want it, right? People want things to be right in work and used for the good of all people and stop tearing people apart from each other. We're neighbors, you know, that was why I wanted to go back to the Roseanne show and say all those things and I'm so happy that I did.

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       I did it in nine episodes, I wonder, 10th season and I did all nine episodes where exactly the episodes I wanted to do, so, uh, and it was number one every week and I just thank my fans for that, you know, a, a turn of fortune. But um, I did what I wanted to do and uh, and it was so gratifying. It's so wonderful and I don't want that to be forgotten. I don't want the ninth season to disappear. I'm in the 10th season to disappear. What do you think about them doing it without you? How fucking weird is that? It is weird. I'm like, oh, I get it. They're sending me a subtle message to ode on opioids.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       You. No, that sounds that. Where you think. Yeah, that's some of it mind control stuff. Yeah. So you think that they want you to kill yourself? Well, I don't know why they would do what they did. Let's put it that way. Doesn't make any sense. I just, I just think they're being completely inconsiderate and they don't care about, you know, they don't and they, they so belittled my contribution to the show too. It just was shocking. That was the most painful part of the whole thing. But one of the things that I read was that you hadn't considered the more than 100 people that work on the show when you did what you did. And I'm like, that is, that's a ridiculous statement. I didn't cancel the show. Not only did you not cancel the show, you were on ambien drunk tweeting. Did the idea that you did this, this was some sort of a deliberate ploy to get the show canceled or the idea that there was any justification that's just shows should be canceled at all.

Speaker 2:          01:01:13       Like what? You can't just say something that you, you didn't want to come out that way and apologize for it. You guys, I apologize. Apologize for three months. No. Yeah, they don't know who you are now. They tried to wipe me off the, uh, off the map of the culture because people are scared to be connected with anybody who's a target and they acted like cowards. I wouldn't have done. I mean, if it were my friend, definitely I would have years of two decades or more, I would have said something and I definitely, one thing I would never have done is, um, stab somebody in the rush to condemn somebody who, you know, was my biggest,

Speaker 4:          01:01:59       uh, advocate.

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       Well, there was a lot of, sometimes an only advocate. There was a lot of that. I saw a lot of that about them. It's just about them. It's not about me. I just let go of all of it because, you know, I, I try, I, I am a person of belief and I just always try to do what's right in front of me. I feel like what, uh, you know, my higher intelligence plays in front of me. I'll do it and [inaudible] it knows better than me and um, which is why I don't think like other people. But, um, and also that, um, I, I was not going to fight not at 66. I'm too old. I, I'm pretty frail and I think, you know, I worked really hard to get a second season and it's kind of ironic. I crossed time-zones to do promotion for free for months. And uh, you know, during that time when you're old and you can't sleep and you're crossing time zones, going from Hawaii to New York and back and then back again and back again, you know, uh, you know, I kind of became dependent on Ambien and I, you know, almost every night took it. And uh,

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       you know, obviously I, something was wrong because I, I didn't think, I thought that tweet was about a science fiction movie, which happens to be my favorite movie. And which I think is a very apt in the world today, particularly in Iran, were just a small group of corrupt leaders are oppressing the citizens. And, uh, I think it, I think there's a lot of references in that movie that, uh, go along with what's happening in Iran, uh, of the human beings rising up to throw over there to over throw their overlords. And that's how I was looking at the whole thing. So when I woke up to tweet there, that was what was in my head. It was certainly not somebody looks and, uh, uh, it was also about the Arab spring in Egypt, which, which, uh, you know, uh, Obama, he didn't handle it right. And, uh, so all those things are interrelated with Iran and the Iran deal, the Iran nuclear deal. You know, I'm, I'm extremely well read on that subject. I certainly wouldn't be at the height of my power and my fame

Speaker 7:          01:04:44       being on there going command key. Excuse me. I'm not an idiot. Okay. I won't be on the key.

Speaker 2:          01:04:53       I'm a well read and intelligent woman in my word and things that I write to people over in that part of the world there. I've brought a lot of people together in that part of the world with my tweets and most of my tweets are spiritual in nature anyway. So, uh, it wasn't what people thought it was and still, I apologize for. I'm inadvertently hurting anyone's feelings still. I apologize for inadvertently and not, you know, I apologize that they were wrong and they misheard it and misunderstood it, but that wasn't good enough either. And you know, just get to a point where I go, I'm letting go of it, uh, my fans who know me and my family and people who like me and know me for my life, they know who I am and that's all that matters. You know, they can call me whatever they want. I don't accept their definition of that word. And I think that they should read more.

Speaker 3:          01:05:55       Well, one of the things that's most shocking about this outrage culture that we live in right now, this age of outrage is that there is no path to redemption. There's, there's no acceptance of these. There is though, be a, but there's not from the general public.

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       Oh yeah, the public. Everywhere I went, people run up to me. I never felt so much love in my entire career, in real life, but not on twitter and I'm not on social media,

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       not on social media, social media. It magnifies the very worst aspects of humanity because you're not interacting with people in the real flesh. You're not experiencing social cues. You're not looking them in the eye, you're not seeing them as a person. You're just seeing them as a target online.

Speaker 2:          01:06:43       Well, I think that twitter has, is a purposeful plan. Uh, like facebook. I got off facebook years ago because I realized what they were doing, what I think twitter is doing and doing the same thing that facebook did. How, so it's manufacturing consent and you know, it's using bots to do it by manufacturing consent. It's a place where like Noam Chomsky says, you know, the press manufacturers consent, that consent of the governed. So that's what they're doing is manufacturing the consent of the governed, but they also manufactured descent. They control the opposition to on twitter. And I liked getting in between those two and causing a Ruckus because I knew it was all artificial intelligence anyway. It's all just a track us, we all know that just like they do in China.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       So what are you saying? You think there's some sort of a grand plan to get people to argue with each other?

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       Yeah, I think it's a social experiment to turn one group against another, which, you know, it's smart because it's divide and conquer. And as long as we're like, you know, it's all these people getting robbed. All these taxpayers getting robbed, sitting there pointing to other tax payers. They're getting robbed and blaming them. But nobody. Everybody needs to look upward of our government asked for an audit of our taxes and actually take responsibility for the things that our country does. We're getting judged for it anyway. I think we allowed.

Speaker 3:          01:08:12       I think there's certainly people that are capitalizing on all this chaos

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       and uh, all the, all the conflict. But I don't think it's manufactured and I don't think it's engineered. I just think it's happening because this is a new thing, this, this ability to interact with each other. I think people have a mind of their own and people are inherently tribal. There's almost no way to stop them from being tribal tribes or tribal, but the problem with tribalism is easy sometimes have enemies that are unnecessary, so you develop this common ground, but that would be nice if we all looked at ourselves as a tribal world. That's how I do look at the world and why I didn't want Hillary Clinton because her party is very much for corporate law and the Republican Party is very much for tribal law and I am a tribal person and I think tribal people should, you know, have their land. Tribal. In what way? How he tribal me? Yeah. Well I'm Jewish.

Speaker 2:          01:09:16       When I go over there to the Middle East, I visit the graves of my teachers. That's how I'm tribal. I go to their graves and that's what we do. That's what all indigenous people do. They want to control their sacred burial grounds and that is anti corporate law and that's why I'm anti corporate law. I can't. I like to study paypal bowls and corporate law and a maritime law and all that kind of stuff. You know, I like to read so I have a lot of information and you know, it makes me angry or sad is that that the work of an artist over 30 years, you think they think that we just pull that out of their ass and that they can copy it, you know, without the artists, they can copy it. You mean your show? I do. Yeah. And it, it, it is. You know, all the stuff I suffered in my life I put into that show.

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       That show is about my family, my children, and it's just like, wow, this is so huge. It's so huge. It's, it's beyond entitled, but what are they going to, what is their plan and how are they able to do that? Did you let them signed off? He asked me to sign off because I felt like I would be a huge hypocrite too. Have talked 30 years or more in my life about labor rights and the rights of working people if I took away those p 200 people's jobs. So that's why I did it. I wanted them to work. I know how they had planned on another season and they probably had already spent the money. Was there any consideration of redemption? Was there any path where they can allow you to apologize or do something that would endear yourself to the people where they heard that? I said, let me go on all your, uh, abc us and explained my tweet and how it was a political and not a racial tweet and um, you know, that was denied me. It's like you can't say anything until you sign off. You can't say anything until you sign off. So they wanted you to sign off the rights and then they would have you do whatever you want to do. Go on their interview shows. They didn't guarantee that, didn't guarantee that. So they just wanted you to sign off and they offered you nothing in return. They offered me some money,

Speaker 2:          01:11:43       but the idea was just to be able to Redo the show. Yeah, to take all those years of my ideas and how I thought of 20 years of those situations to come back. It took me 20 years to figure out how would these characters, where would they be now? And I did that by living among regular normal people for 20 years. I never lived behind a, you know, a racially segregated gates like other stars. I lived in working people's neighborhoods and I farm around farmers and I wasn't going to be that big of a hypocrite. Macadamia nut farm. I sure do. It's gorgeous. You should come and see it. I love the Big Island. Isn't it gorgeous? Amazing. People are dumb. They're though today. You know what I read from people. Some lady took a boat full of people too close to the volcano to look at it and the lava over took their boat and thank God.

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       Now I'm were killed, but they were got like about two feet up on the. Oh Jesus. So don't do that. Hawaiians don't do that. Somebody got hit with there. That's probably why it's pretty good weed. Yeah. They got hit by a flying chunk of rock from the volcano on. Um, one of the boats too. They were having lava tourism and someone gets hit by a rock. It's so not smart. It's so stupid. It's a dangerous, dangerous situations. Shouldn't be. Don't go on those tours. Your area safe. Uh, my, my area flooded a bed. I had to replace my roads for about the 10th time in 10 years. I always got to replace my roads. I really got into making roads. That's one thing that I really did enjoy. So I'll be headed back there and be making more roads. I'm excited about it. I can cut a road like nobody's business.

Speaker 2:          01:13:29       I'm a hell of. I wanted to write a book. My granny is a scout and a [inaudible]. I do scout the jungle, you know, and make a road in there. I love the attitude of people that live in the big island. It's a very relaxed, laid back, friendly attitude. The, they just have all the time in the world. It's a different sort of vibe when you go there. Yeah, everybody helps their neighbors, their, they don't like turn them in where everybody helps out their neighbors and their neighbors are like every, every kind of people you can think of it. It's very, uh, a very, um, diverse cultural. How'd you wind up Medicare? Well, I went there because my son Buck I had, I made him go to the school out there. So then I bought a place right by the d school because this kid, you know, he had feel he's 23 now so he probably won't get mad, but he had some severe adhd there, so I had to do what I did to get him. Now he just graduated from college. He's doing real good. Yeah, he is my first college Grad.

Speaker 4:          01:14:38       [inaudible] all right.

Speaker 2:          01:14:41       Adhd. Maybe he's a comic. Yeah. He's so funny. Oh my God, he's so hilarious. Maybe he's a comic to sweet, so. Sure it's, my grandkids are too. They're all video that you show me. They're all hilarious. Yeah, they seemed very funny. Oh, what are they gonna do to your character on the show? Uh, they're gonna kill you off. Yeah, I think they did. They didn't tell you some of. I know they didn't tell me. How weird is it? Some of my spies told me. How weird is it? They're taking you out of Roseanne. They're calling it the connors. It's all going on without you being there.

Speaker 4:          01:15:21       What does that feel like?

Speaker 2:          01:15:24       Um, it's a mind warp and a mind fuck, you know. So I'm just trying to go from a tweet. Yeah, a miss. Understood. Tweet, misunderstood. Tweet while you're on ambien while you're drunk. Drunk only had like one or two beers. Well, when you have one or two beers with ambien. Yeah, I guess you're drunk. You're fucked up. I was, yeah. I wasn't in smoking pot too, right? No, I don't think I'd smoke pot then. No, I didn't smoke pot then

Speaker 2:          01:15:58       I was at my mom's house on the. So I went down in the basement. I was hiding down there in the basement because they were surrounded my mom's house, Papa razzies and search. And so as a down in the basement. And that's where I always used to go when I was 13 and I found this stuff and chalk on the, on the walls of the basement there that I remembered right when I was 13. And then I found an old. But from one I snuck segues when I was 13. Smoking. Oh hell yeah. It smell good. No, I'm kidding. But I was hiding down there smoking. They were knocking on my mom's door and I was like, oh my God. So my boyfriend got the door. He's like a big man, you know, he's like, may I help, you know, that's my man character. And uh, I thought they were gonna, you know, say something. And they're like, we just please tell Roseanne we love her and you know, we don't like this and Blah Blah. And that was happening all the time. And that's when I was like, Geez, I've never ever felt this kind of affection

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       from people in all my career. So it's kind of a cool. That's, that's the thing, there's the social media outrage and then there's people in real life that feel terrible for you because they feel like you got a raw deal. Yeah. They think that there's doubt there. There are so many double standards of people who said things on the air. Remember I just said it to a small population, less than 600,000 people on twitter, but these people say things on the air and they are not. Well, I know joy had to call pants and apologize. So yeah. What a joy bay say about pence. It was so bad. She something about his Christian faith that they're psychotic or something because they. So she'd call us. Yeah, that's what I heard, you know, an apology with your network behind you really works. Like with, what's her name that called Ivanka?

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       The names. I can't remember. Samantha and her network was behind her and that was far more offensive and it was on the air and uh, but when your network is not behind you that you don't really know they were. They didn't want me to tweet the whole. The whole truth is I, I told him I wasn't going to tweet and you know, I promised him over and over and although they never send it in writing, which was required, but anyway, they called my publicist and unloaded on him all the time. Can, you know, I should've stayed up twitter. I did it to myself and uh, you know, I made a mistake and, and the ball kept rolling, put. It's just crazy that this what I think is insignificant mistake, especially in light of your apology could lead to no redemption possible. Yeah. Didn't no redemption possible.

Speaker 1:          01:18:58       That this giant fucking hit show. And I look, I don't know what's going to happen with the connors, but I think it's going to fail. Asked me if I had some money to bet if I was in vegas because that shit ain't gonna work. How's it? Good. How Are you going to do Rosanna without Roseanne? If you wanted to have a whole new sitcom with all those people with a totally unrelated storyline, that's one thing, but you don't think America is going to know that they killed you off. Like what the fuck is that and that and now with time and consideration after time has passed and people can review everything, they're going to go was really this bad and they're going to think about their own lives. Like what about me? What if I say something fucked up just fucking around. I take ambien and accidentally say something crazy and don't even remember saying it and then it's misconstrued or it comes out wrong. Is it going to ruin my whole life? Like how can you have someone ruined their whole life for something that is misconstrued teen also a in a rally. I mean that's why I think first of all us women, we need to do a better job of raising our sons and a bet at 17. Everyone's out of their frigging mind. I have five kids.

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       There's not a one of them who didn't do something horrendous at eight,

Speaker 3:          01:20:11       17. What? We were just talking about that with Andrew Santina who was in here earlier. That yeah. When when young men, especially young men that don't get a birds and the bees speech and who knows what the fuck is going on in their home, you know, people do stupid shit.

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       Yeah. My son that went to college, but he says he learned the day he started college. They gave out this pamphlet on sexual assault to all the boys. I guess I gave it to the girls too, but he said he read it and he realized it was any kind of sexuality at all is don't even do it. And I, I told both. My sons, do you got to get you. If you're going to have sex with somebody, you make them sign a consent form and have take it to their lawyer and get it properly notarized and then make a date for after that happened. Live in this dangerous time for our sons and our daughters.

Speaker 3:          01:21:00       Well, it's always a dangerous time for women right in with the wrong man.

Speaker 2:          01:21:05       Well, or the wrong woman. Are you shitting me? Women are just as horrible as man. I'm terrible with women to this one.

Speaker 3:          01:21:14       Cool assault and rape, uh, amongst lesbian couples. It's, it's pretty bad,

Speaker 2:          01:21:19       but I mean, what about rape in the prisons? I mean, nobody talks about that. That's, that's the real rape culture where men are learning, you know, it's terrible.

Speaker 3:          01:21:29       Well, yeah. Well we can get into depth about how bad prisons are in general and how people aren't reading.

Speaker 2:          01:21:34       You ever watch orange is the new block, so I know. I've never seen it. It's great. Oh my God, it's great.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       But the problem with, you know, there's no rehabilitation. I mean it's, it's very rare looseness in, in prisons. What you're doing is you take people and you make them better criminals or make a more hardened criminals. You surrounded with other criminals. You give them a horrible work,

Speaker 2:          01:21:54       Lord, living further because most prisoners are in their because they're abused children. Well, and what percentage of prisoners are in there for nonviolent drug offenses just drives me crazy. Fucking insane. When I ran for president, I ran on legalization of marijuana for that exact reason. Well, slowly but surely. That's becoming a mainstream idea. I'm glad.

Speaker 3:          01:22:14       Glad to. I mean, as a rabid pot user, I love it. No, I think marijuana is, it makes you more sensitive, aware person. It definitely makes you paranoid, but I think that paranoia allows you to understand all the danger in the world that you probably ignoring.

Speaker 2:          01:22:33       Yeah. One more time, like I was with March, you know, uh, once I started smoking pot, then I got real paranoid of people and that was a good thing. You shouldn't be paranoid of. People should be aware of for sure. Particularly if you watch cable TV for crisis, that ID channel.

Speaker 3:          01:22:51       What are you doing now? Like what are you going to do now? You were saying that you have some other things cooking.

Speaker 2:          01:23:00       You know, I got 20,000 ideas a day. Why don't you do something like this? I got a focus into something. Why don't you do this? Which something like this. So easy. So you said You'd help me? I just can't. I don't know how to write it in a fucking password. Turn this shit on. Listen, you don't need that. We can get you connected to someone who can do that for you. That shit's easy. I'd like to talk to other people who've fallen from grace and see how they get back up, but the, the real truth of it is that there is redemption, there is and there, there's moving on and there's like stopping the fight and there's like, you know, for me it was a while. I realized they're not my family. My real family is, you know, a joy to me. And uh, I got a great real family. I raised two good sons and uh, you know, of course I want them protected from crazy women for crying out loud. I, I over modulate their dating lives. I do filter them. Yeah. You have two. How old are your sons? Once 40.

Speaker 2:          01:24:15       Try to filter my dating life would be like, mom, I love you. Yeah, shut the fuck up. That's because your mom ain't me. That's true. Because I go, no, this is, you know, we can't have no bitches up in, can't. I can't take no second class picks telling me I'm beneath her. That's why I helped break up my son's marriage because she way she treated me. You had someone who's disrespecting, you know, you're never gonna fucking well that and all my daughters, thank God all their sons, they listened to me. They do what I tell them, so it's great.

Speaker 2:          01:24:53       So I have good son in laws. That's good. The One? No, he's a problem. He's from Russia. He's Russian. And on his wedding night, here's what he says to me. He goes, does he have a Russian accent? Yeah. Can you do it? Oh, I can't do that. I try. Well, here's what he said to me, knowing this family, it's a family. We do what the law says. We don't do what the grandma's grandma says. I go, bitch, are you new? I go, okay, well, if you want to live a curse live, go ahead and live in fucking curse life. I put that Judy. Yeah, he's coming around though. I knew he would have. Now they have a son and he has adhd too. And uh, but he's brilliant and as all my grandkids. And anyway, so they were there. Those lived. Oh, I shouldn't have said that loop towards. No, you can't say that anymore. Now you're

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       not to say that I forgot because I'm old. I mixed them up. Who says you're not to say that everybody says you don't say the t word, so as long as you don't have a reebok before, I think you're allowed to say it. No, I don't say it in public but not and I don't. But uh, anyway, so, um, you know, the kid he's bouncing off the walls to like all my kids were so I know how to deal with it, you know, I said just leave them over here with me. I'll take care of it. So I did. Would you do with them? Get them active? Yeah. You get them active. Get them doing stuff. Exactly. I go, I bet you I bet you $100. You can't run up and down that hill 10 times in a row. Perfect. GotTa keep boys tired. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       I guarantee I have adhd. I have all those things. Yeah. You probably do do stuff. Just burning this stuff. Yeah. Bring it out and then he can be calm. Yeah, exactly. I think those kids just have a lot of fuel. I do have a lot of horsepower and a lot of fuel and it's all misdirected and then get in with the girl and she started telling them what to do. So I'm telling you, once they get under the control of a female, say there they forget theirselves. Girls do it too. Sure. We get to control the wrong guy. You gotta not getting control and nobody. Anybody. That's the key. Autonomy in. What do they call it? Sovereignty. You gotta. Keep that. Find somebody who doesn't control you, just accepts you. Light should be. Don't make your shower. Now they have to make them shower. Oh, my boys should at least suggest it in a nice way to let them know. Fuck is going on with your smell, son. Yeah. I come from weird line of women that liked that man's mouth. It was gross. My mom, she is to always go over and sniff under my dad's armpits. So girls don't wonder. I'm like, I am. You know. So when you were tires that she likes monkey smell, don't say that word. Funky white guy. It's all right. Oh, you call white people monkeys. My Dad was real dark. How dark he was. Brown. Brown. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       Well, um, maybe it'd be problematic. She was real fair, fair, scanned a mom. So I've learned a thing or two jail hear that to me. All people look like some kind of. I mean I didn't say anything about Valerie Jarrett, but don the subject, I think people resemble animals a lot. So we are animals. We are animals. Like I think I look like a beaver when I look at my pictures, do anything I looked like a beaver or a cat detect. I can see myself as a believer. My kids think I'm real catlike yes. Yeah. My boyfriend says slaw off.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       I'd just lay there in bed watching the ID channel and murderers and serial killer shows. Oh my God. Because I love how this character is put together, you know, writing characters, you know, you just like, I liked the forensics thing when they put shit together, you know, and they go, they are our purpose. Our purpose of 40 year old white man lives with his mother needs prevalent. It was in the navy, you know, all that. So I love all that I would have done that if I wasn't a comic genius. I think the real real problem with that though is that the more you study that shit, the more you live in that world, the less happiness you're going to find. I've talked to guys that what world? The world of serial killers, the world studying it, reading about it, the actual people that investigate those people.

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       Oh yeah. They have a real hard time with life. They have a real hard time because they know too much. They know too much about the day. You watch it show mine hunter. I didn't watch that one though. John Douglas. Yeah. I've seen so many of those shows. I've read books on serial killers. I, you know, and I've, I've known cops that investigated stuff like this. Well after I had that thing with marge, I got really into it like Oh my God. But you realize that some people out there that are there, but dark mind, they're capable. Some fucked up shit. Yeah they are. And if you were around that all the time, I just think you're appreciation for. It's like it's one thing to know that it exists and it's real, but it's another thing to let that enter into your, your view of the world and have it in there as a standard standard trying to behavior. I guess it's wrong to do that, but you know, nothing else interests me.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       Why is it interesting to you so much? Just because it's such a bizarre how they get away with it and they're like, oh, he was the nicest guy. How they their front, you know the golden state killer, right? You know that one, that they just this together. That was what it was called Golden state killer. That fucking guy got away with it forever. Patton Oswalt's wife who died of a drug overdose was actually investigating that. She died of a drug. I thought she died from fentanyl. Oh, everyone's dying from that. Started from that shit. Everybody's standing from that. I mean, where can I get some? It must be good if that's the conners to get you. I don't know what you're gonna do A. I don't want to say nothing negative. Bring you back. You'll be like a. You could be like a from beyond the grave. You could give advice to people on the show. That'd be a great way. They can kill you off and bring you back to the same time. Ghost a ghost. He come to John Goodman the middle of the night. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah. You come up with something better than just

Speaker 8:          01:32:00       killing you off. Yeah. Then just letting it go. Well, I think, I mean they do all these movies about robots and other words. I don't want to be connected with a racist, a racist, and that's what's so fucking stupid about this. They had a number one show, a great sitcoms. It returns. It's even, it's just as good if not better than it was when it first came out. It was a bit better too. It was great. Thank you. Well, you know, that was all I was meant to do so you know, I did it. I did it number one after 20 years. What about doing standup again? I'm doing standup. I'm tillery next year and by then and my gag order will be over. You have a gag order.

Speaker 8:          01:32:44       Can you talk about the gag order or is that a part of the gag order? It's a part. Be careful. Go are there that I can talk about it. Let's just talk about. Yeah, I just want to say I wish everybody the best. You know, I. I wish. Well for everyone on earth. That's all I'm going to say. When are you going to do standup next year? Twenty, 19? Where are you going to do it? I can't remember what they said in the Midwest. All across the Midwest. Are you writing already? Are you performing at all? I mean, are you. You're just writing? Yeah. And how are you going to do it? Are you going to start out at clubs? Are you going to theaters, casinos? Do you have a framework of what you're going to talk about? Talk about raising good sons and all that that entails.

Speaker 8:          01:33:34       Are you going to bring someone with you on the road to warm up or. I probably should. I don't know. I have. It's kind of saying I wanted to call headline too. I thought to co headlined with Monique would be a blast. That's a great idea. Me and her talked about it. That'd be fun. Yeah. I mean anybody just just to get out there again, tell me a joke. I really liked hearing people laugh. That'd be a great thing for you to do it better. Do it. How long has it been Susan? Stand up. Oh, I did it just before, you know. In fact, I think that's why I got so rundown. You know, I got so rundown when I, you know, this whole thing. I was so run down at that point that I had no b vitamins in my body. How's it impossible?

Speaker 8:          01:34:18       Well, I made was that really low level? And the doctor said, you know, that can cause psychosis. So that's where I go. Okay. That's what happened to me. Really. I was at white. I was getting way out there in Salt Lake City, Utah. Anyway, after I, I did do standup all through Canada and then I ended up in New York doing promo for Rosanne and uh, you know, I just got to run down. I didn't, I didn't watch myself and do what I should have done for my physical health this time around. Let's get you sorted it out and sketch on some vitamins and get your nutritionist and get somebody who's going to do some blood work you and make sure everything's okay. Blood work done. I always go, I go to the cancer center at a whatever that hospitals called over there. Yeah, that's good. But I always have to have infusions every three months because I, I don't absorb minerals or vitamins.

Speaker 8:          01:35:13       What do you mean you don't absorb them? Yeah. I had this gastric bypass about 25 or so years ago and I can't absorb minerals or vitamins and so I have to go get infusions every, you know, when I get to down and I, like I said, I was promoting the residential and also doing some touring Canada and I got to run down and I, I just, uh, I, I, I think I had a mental collapse. I told the network, I said, obviously I'm not behaving in the right way and I will check myself in and get my meds checked to make sure I'm, you know, you know, so I said I have mental health issues and you know, I, I said also I thought that woman was white and it wasn't anything about race. It was about Iran. And it was like, well, we'll see how this washes out in Sherman. Yeah, we'll see how this washes. And then 20 minutes later Wanda Sykes tweeted, let me off this show.

Speaker 8:          01:36:15       And then Sarah Gilbert tweeted, shortly thereafter a, something about she was ashamed of one cast member and a would. That one blew me away. And uh, and Michael Fishman tweeted a, he was ashamed of my racism or some shit. And uh, that was hard to take. But, uh, it was because it was so, it seemed orchestrated because they use the same words, you know, a egregious unforgivable. But in fact it might have been offensive. And like when I was talking to Mike Today, I said, you know, we all say things that are racially insensitive at times. All of us do that. I'm a Jew, I've heard everything and uh, you know, or, or ethnically offensive to somebody, but that doesn't mean where the KKK. Okay. That doesn't mean we're, uh, you know, fascists or you know, and especially if we apologize because most people who are offensive, they mean to be offensive and they don't apologize.

Speaker 8:          01:37:20       And I think that's when, you know there's a difference and if you don't have the discretion to understand that something's wrong with you and I think something's wrong with people that they're so hateful and uh, so unforgiving and if you don't vote the way they think you should vote, that they feel justified in being. So, um, what's the word? Self sanctimonious and self righteous. And when they themselves are, you know, kind of saying far more offensive things about people's children and such. For instance, I think people are just cowards. And I think when things like this happen, they want to separate themselves from controversy and make sure that they're not a part of the people that I can understand that I can kind of understand that, but I don't get it. I don't they do, you know, and you know, I'm like, wow. They also get really, really upset when a few years later somebody does the exact same thing to them and go, what goes around comes around and that's true and especially true in Hollywood.

Speaker 8:          01:38:25       That guide that fired me just was fired a couple of weeks ago for what? I don't know that his contract wasn't renewed and his last words were, well, I didn't know I'd be forced to cancel our number one show. It wasn't forced to do anything. Well, he might've been forced. They're all fools. This should just. First of all, they should have let the dust settle. Second of all, they should have examined what you actually said and what your intentions were and let you apologize and then have a conversation with you on one of their shows in long form. You May, in a teaching moment such as Valerie jarret would have accepted that. I said, I would like to debate her on the Iran deal and explain what I what I said, well, you know, that's not necessarily what Americans should know about that deal. Well, maybe they should, but I don't think that's completely related to the tweet, but it would have been a teachable moment maybe, but it also would've been a distraction from what you were trying to say.

Speaker 8:          01:39:23       Well, they didn't let me say it right. And uh, you know, um, but to get involved like openly, politically, the television show, that's dangerous. But Taylor swift just did it. What did she say? Just get out and vote Democrat. Wasn't that like, it's almost abstract. Get out and vote, you know, she's not, she said vote for the Democrat. I don't like the Republican. Marsha Blackburn, she didn't like her. Although Marsha Blackburn has been the author of a lot of great anti rape laws and all kinds of stuff like that, but she didn't like her because she's a Republican, says she took a stand, a political stand, I guess. Uh, you know, some people can do it, but some people can't. And the political stand I took, which I just want to remind people is that I'm, I'm, I'm an independent. That's my stance.

Speaker 8:          01:40:17       And I just thought both sides had gone too far out and need to talk to each other. So I came back and did a show about that. That's the stance you took with your show and in my life it's like if we can even discuss things that's really, really bad, that's not American. We we discuss and debate. We don't label and black list, which we certainly can talk things and maybe that's something that you could have done once they had a conversation with you about your tweet. But I mean I just think that what they did was just very hasty and very foolhardy. And they should have known who were beforehand.

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       They should have known about your mental health issues. They should know. They should have known about your medication issues, all of those things. But this is what my point was. If you have a person with a broken leg and they can't run and you get mad at them because they can't run the. Isn't that ridiculous? Well, if you have a person that has brain issues and then they do something that's erratic and you're mad at them for that, well you're a fucking idiot that's stupid and you call them a racist or chastise them in front of the world so that you remove any possible any, any possible negative opinions that could be cast your way, but that's what a lot of it is, is deflection. They're worried about negative opinions and negative feedback that's going to come their way so they immediately turn on you.

Speaker 3:          01:41:42       They turn on you in a disproportionate way. While they did cancel the show before evening, one advertiser had pulled out. It's the Sarah Silvermans bet. I'm against a amber that I'm against it. Well, there's a lot of cowardice going on. There's a lot of people trying to save their jobs and people panic because people are aware of the outrage culture that we live in. This is an outrage nation right now. It's. It's one of our number one forms of recreation. People love it. They love getting mad at whoever the fuck it is. As long as you react the way they want you to react. Oh, they love it. It's an inquisition. Well, it's the understanding that people have way more power to affect change. Whether it's good change or bad change. They're pushing buttons with social media and without rage and with their ability to express themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:42:33       It's unprecedented. There's never been a time like this in history where people can Salem witch trials, right? Well that was just like, okay, well if you swam that proves you're a witch, and then we have to drown. You know, uh, it has said there has to be a loser, there has to be two winters. Well, there, there has to be an understanding of what's happening here. And then people have to have an understanding of the power that they're wielding and what they're doing and that it turned back on them. And it never just stop at one person. That's why I said I'm surprised that a lot more comics didn't defend me because you know, this means that anything they find it in your timeline that they think is offensive, they can mischaracterize and bringing a whole a battle against you that you can't possibly win and take your life's work.

Speaker 3:          01:43:23       Well, how many did defend you? I'm nobody defended me, but I did. You did. Thank you. Stan. Hope. Did Stan hope dead? Yeah. Um, there was a time that we're working with no, none of them that worked with you. Well, everybody that works, you wanted to keep their job. Yeah. And I don't blame them. Don't blame them. They needed the money and probably already spent it. Well, the other thing too, the life that, that fucking schedule is ruthless. It's growing. You know what I think it was, a lot of it was, um, you know, I gave him the gun to shoot me. I mean, I wasn't a helpless victim, although I think my explanation either make sense or doesn't make sense. But uh, well if you're compassionate it makes sense. But a lot of people aren't. But, um, you know, uh, I forgot what I was getting.

Speaker 3:          01:44:18       I don't even know if they're not compassionate. Roseanne. I think they're scared. I think that just chicken shit. I don't think they're looking at it from it in terms of like, I can't win here and I can't lose here. Let me just look at what's right. See, I didn't have anything to win or lose. So what I looked at it, I looked at you as someone that I admire. Some of that I think is one of the best comics ever who I think I know that you have mental health issues. I knew from talking to you that you were on Ambien and I knew you had alcohol as well. I know what that does. My mom took ambien. She woke up in the middle of the night and drew all over the bathroom rug, drool over it with lipstick and, and, and um, and nail Polish.

Speaker 3:          01:44:53       She said like a little kid. So Shit. You woke up in the morning. She had no idea she did it. She's terrified of that shit. She won't take it now. I have friends, many friends that have had bad experiences on ambulance tail and I thought, well, they shouldn't have shut down that conversation like that. They shouldn't have. It's a fucking dangerous drug to for the wrong people in the wrong situations. Especially when you mix it with alcohol. I mean it's beneficial to people that need sleep in certain situations. I don't recommend it, I don't take it, but some people like it. That's fine. But to ignore what the actual pharmacological effect on the human body is is ridiculous because there's studies on this shit and that people understand the interaction between chemicals and the human brain and there are erratic and especially when you mix them with things, you're not supposed to mix them with.

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       Weird Shit happens. I thought it was gonna. I thought I was going to expand on it in the morning and you know, talk about that movie and a too late. Yeah, well it could. It was too late to put. The whole thing is just fucking crazy when, when telling me not to tweet. Yeah. Well, it's probably a good idea, but now honestly the problem also a twitter's fucking text is just too. It's too simple. It's too crude a way of communicating. It really is, but you can get across some ideas like you can say, hey, I went to see little foot's a great movie. That's a good thing to tweet. Real simple shit like that, but you want to talk about like political things or things that involve nuance or seeing things that are complex. I just don't think it's the way to communicate. I know it's terrible way to communicate, not communicate.

Speaker 3:          01:46:31       It's like a, what did he say? A search and destroy oil. For some folks, there's going to be people that always want to make things crash and burn. They like it. They like buttons. They like hitting the buttons. They like to see people suffer. Well. They definitely are suffering themselves. Look, there's a giant percentage of our population that lives in misery that they do all day long and they. They have mental health issues. They're exhausted, they're depressed, they're there. They have despair, they're overwhelmed with bills. They're in shitty relationships and they're overwhelmed and they're angry and they look at someone like you are rich white lady, and I'm like, fuck that bitch, and they just want to attack you. It doesn't have to make sense because it's a reflection of their own personal pain as much as it's a reflection of their irresponsibility with this power that they're wielding through social media. And then there's the mob mentality. There's a bunch of people that are already going after you. Good. I want to go after a two. I'm going to show the world that I'm not racist and you know how I'm going to do that. I'm going to shit all over this racist, this racist Roseanne. They don't care if you're really racist.

Speaker 8:          01:47:32       But the thing that gets me about it is it's, I'm going to shit all over this Jew because I was talking about Iran as a Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and uh, you know, all kinds of error when you're talking about complexity. It is complex, but I always was on there talking, uh, you know, defending or, you know, speaking for Jewish people. And so, you know, I just, I think that in the long run I've really wanted to be known that I, I am a Jew and we're speaking as a Jew and when I spoke about the Iran deal and its effect on a Jewish people in the Middle East, and I really thought first they didn't know that, but now I think, well they had to know some of it. I don't think they want to know. This is what I think you say when someone says that's a black woman. What is she one eighth black, like what is she? Um, something very small, 46 percent or something. Really? Yeah. She had her DNA done was talking about it and 40 something Caucasian and it doesn't look like, but whatever, whatever. We can't tell who people are by how they look on one point six percent African. Cool. Awesome. That's the heart of the world. When you look at what happened, I think it's real simple. I think

Speaker 3:          01:48:57       she identifies or people identify her as a black woman. You said planet of the Apes Racist. Boom. It's that simple. I don't think they give a fuck if you're a Jew. I don't think they care if you're not racist. I think this is a

Speaker 8:          01:49:08       viable target. And they go, well, I said I voted for trump. So that was a target to that too. And then, and then they could find a, a, a tweet from the past. I forget either. Oh yeah. Maya got in trouble for that alone many times. There's just things you can't say. And then there's worse things that you can. So it's weird because they don't censor anybody who's calling for, uh, you know, to kill all the Jews. There's thousands of them just shared about the not famous women with sitcoms. Yeah, they are who, uh, you know, people that are, are tweeting support for Valerie Jarrett,

Speaker 3:          01:49:49       you know, they're pissed at me and saying, how could you say this about not saying that because they're saying kill the Jews. They don't, they don't. Maybe know what your point was like. I didn't know about her parentage. I mean, come on. This is, this is the truth. This is who I am. And you know, they, they, uh, they did this too, but they're not really saying kill the Jews. It's not like a valid comparison. Well I'm a Jew, I understand that. But the people, that's how it feels. Maybe it feels that way to you guys. But the people that are robust, they're upset at you because they think you said something racist. They're not saying kill the Jews. Well, but they are to us. Okay. You see how when people look at your situation, I can see how they think. But you see how when people look at your situation and they think it's racist, that is also how you look at. They're reacting to what they think is racist and you thinking that they're saying kill all the Jews.

Speaker 8:          01:50:52       They're saying like, uh, you know, Iran everyday threatens the Jewish people in Israel with annihilation and they've already survived,

Speaker 3:          01:51:02       you know, not too long ago, an annihilation. So, and then we make a deal with that government. What does that say something? I understand that, but this is many steps past. But to me that you said a racist thing or thinking you said a racist. And understand that they think I said a racist thing. I understand that completely. They have no idea that this had anything to do with Jews versus Iran. They really don't have any idea. I've never seen that. I've never seen that registered. But because it's not important enough to them to know that well, it's probably not been explained to them. For one, I know your position like this, like you're, you're talking about now I understand that they might not even think it's valid. Like if they went back and went over it and you might disagree with the political aspects of it. Yes. And they're free to do that. I'm not going to try to be know what I'm saying. Like they're not the reason why I said it's not a valid comparison. They're not really saying kill the Jews,

Speaker 8:          01:51:57       but to me and to other Jews, they are in fact saying that. And, and that's very common amongst us. So you know, that's, that's the truth that many of us think and you know, people are understand it or they don't care to even consider it. Well, they don't have to, but I'm still going to say it because that's the reality. It's the reality to hear that and to hear the United States wanting gave them billions of our tax dollars when they're the number one supporter of terror in the world. It is and they always do Kale, Jews like in Paris and wherever else they go and they do it in London too. I mean, you know, I hate to wake people up, but you know, it is important. At least it is to me and to people like me and to many other people. Many Christians is very important to them, to their.

Speaker 8:          01:52:56       They're under onslaught too. I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about because you're talking about Iranians killing people in Paris and England. I'm talking about being the number one sponsor of terror in the world. Iran, but they're killing people in France and England that are Jews. Who, when? When is this happening? Well, when they that theater and a lot of other times, but there's a lot of Jewish woman to death and her and her Paris apartment. There's a lot of it. I'm not saying they only killed Jews, but they do kale juice and the money goes back to those terrorist organizations that are funded by Qatar and Iran.

Speaker 8:          01:53:41       Okay. This is a. This is a pretty. These, these are general things you're saying, right? Yeah. It's very general and there's 100 shades. There's 100 shades, but I'm just saying as a Jew with a family in Israel, this is what we think and this is how we feel and to not even acknowledge that and any discussion is kind of disturbing. It should be factored in. I don't think it's a matter of not acknowledging it. I think it should be factored in as well. They're aware that this had anything to do with your motivation. Well, express. I've never read it anywhere, but you can't say it last time I'm saying it. He can't say it. It's not really smiled on to go against the people who control our media and say, especially social media and say that you're pro Israel or you know, that you think, um, you don't think that the media will allow you to be pro Israel. I mean, that seems like a really common thing, not on social media for the most part. No, it's very anti Israel. You'll, I'll send you statistics. Well, I see some anti Israel sentiment and especially in relation to a, they treat the Palestinians

Speaker 8:          01:54:59       like I see a lot of that. Well, I'm not going to play into either of those because I, I really believe that, uh, you know, there's a solution to that problem. The solution is pace and I think it can be achieved. So I'm not going to play either one of those games about who does this or what. I'd just like to see a solution that works for all the people. They're all people. They're so, um, but it can be but it can't be if one side has been completely censored and it, that isn't a discussion or is it a debate and nor is it an American scary. It's scary times when, you know, like on our college campuses today, I know this because my son was on one and you know, it's a far left far left. Professors that espouse that kind of stuff daily in all of our colleges.

Speaker 8:          01:55:51       And it does find its way to the media. You look at the media that most, what are they called, millennium millennials consume and it's heavily, uh, to the left it is. And so that's where they're informing. They're, they, they are getting their opinions from only hearing one side of things on social media. And I don't think that's good. I don't think it's good that all conservative voices are being censored off twitter. You know, and not all, I shouldn't say all, but so many are because that's a way to shut down discussion to. There's quite a few conservative voices on twitter, but some are when they think they're inflammatory or they think they're espousing hate. Yeah. But they get to decide that you're this deciding that it's people who are heavily political. Yes. That's not right. It shouldn't be. It should be more in the middle where we're both sides are considered to come to a consensus means is a diverse opinion and that's how you reach consensus.

Speaker 8:          01:56:54       You don't get a consensus. So nor solution from only listening to one side blather on the same ship for 20 years. That keeps people fighting at each other, not always fighting. I think it recruits people for the other side. I think it does the opposite of its intended effect. That's one of my friends said. He said he thinks Michael Moore. That's Michael Moore's role since he's a billionaire too, that he's a billionaire. Well, they said this is what they said. I don't know, but it's in that vein. It's like, well, he did get so many people to vote for trump when he said that stuff about people are angry and they don't think he did it on purpose. I think a lot of people credit him for voting for trump for that speech. Well, I'm sure my friend said maybe he's a double agent, which I don't think he.

Speaker 8:          01:57:41       I think this is one of the things that happens when it's like when, when when you give people that much suppression and you, you try to indoctrinate people into thinking a certain way, there's going to be people that resistant a large help sell and seems larger and larger, but freedom of thought is the basis of this country. It's not freedom of speech or freedom of religion and freedom of expression, the second amendment, those are symptoms of freedom of thought and it did good to consume endless propaganda and never have it broken down or a or debated or pointed out that it's fault. There is an issue when you're only getting one side of the argument and the people that are controlling the media only want that one side expressed. That is a problem. Yeah, and the thing too that right now in terms of wing version of it, well because they won't let it happen, but who's they? You know, people that are in charge

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       of programming the networks, they don't want that. It, it seemed to always lean left. I mean technologically oriented companies and corporations always almost invariably lean left. Why do you think that is? They're smart, they're educated, they're fresh out of college. The colleges are indoctrinating leftwing kids and you know, you have a vast majority of professors at universities all across the country that identify as Democrats. Right? So this is the indoctrination they get from people that they respect deeply and that they're learning from. And there's also an understanding that this is the way you advance, you know, and then when someone comes out that has anything diminish, you didn't think that it has a brain center that'll coordinate. It's not coordinated in terms of the government. I think what's happening in the universities is you've get people that are, first of all, they're existing in this bizarre glass walled garden where they, they go to universities to get indoctrinated into this left wing cultures and then they start teaching at university.

Speaker 3:          01:59:48       So they never get out into the real world. And then they teach children these thoughts and ideas and then most of the kids leave and they take these ideas somewhere else. And then slowly over time they become more moderate. Most of them do or they, they reject those ideas and either go to the center or go right or some of them stay left. But when they go into tech companies, a lot of them go center, which is I think probably where sanity is. I think Saturday is somewhere in the center and I think discussion is critical. I have a lot of friends that are Republican. I have a lot of friends that are liberal, there's nothing wrong with either either mindset and the only way we find out whether or not we really agree or disagree is we let people express themselves and as soon as you suppress that kind of expression, then you run into real problems.

Speaker 3:          02:00:36       That's absolutely right. And that's what I wanted on my show that I would show that there was a, uh, a trump lover and a trump hater in the same house and they managed to deal with it and get on with it. That's a great, that's a great premise for a show. And it was one of the reasons why I think people loved it so much is because there was that conflict. And because look, people can love a lovable curmudgeon. People can love someone who has ideas that they disagree with. People can love someone who lives with someone who has a completely opposing opinion. They figure it out and they get along. That's fine. That's great. That's great. And my boyfriend, my boyfriend said, you have a mistake, is that you put a cramp in the hate business. I don't think that's the case. I think that just you, just you, you became a target. You fucked up. They were happy from the beginning. I don't think they really wanted me to come back. I think there's a certain amount of that when they found out that you're a trump supporter and then the show became successful and Donald Trump loved it and then trump supporters. Lafayette was a trouble maker and a big mouth. They've always thought that, well,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       you're a comic. I know and everybody remembers when you sang the national anthem and grabbed your crotch and spit on the ground. I remember that. I do that. When you do that gastric bypass thing, is that something they can reverse? They could reverse it, but what the hell? Then I'll wait. Hundred books. You really don't. You wouldn't, would you just everything. Oh fuck. Yeah, that's all I had it because I couldn't stop talking about addiction. Impulsive, right? Oh yeah. All Day long. Eclairs what have you. It was great. I hate those goddamn things. Claire's no got gastric bypass surgeries. A lot of people. Yeah, they do, but I just wish there was a better way just because it fucks up your nutrient absorption abilities like you were talking about. Yeah, I mean I've heard that from several people. I know guys who have gotten in their mental state.

Speaker 1:          02:02:37       Yeah, I'm sure. Oh, for sure. A lot of it has to do with the. The, the health of your, you know, your, your body, your ability to absorb nutrients affects everything. Your mood, your energy levels, everything. You mean food doesn't get in there the right way. No, I just lay in bed till they called for me enough to stumble in and do my thing. Go back to bed. I just had no energy in Brazil. Why don't you do something like this? Like this, this conversation with these. You could do this on your time whenever you want to do it without anybody telling you what to say or what not to say without any executives, without anybody to fire you. You Diy Youtube, they kick you off everything they could, but I don't think they would. And on top of that, you could do it off of your own website.

Speaker 1:          02:03:27       You could do it on Roseanne Barr Dot com. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always afraid they'll come. I just feel like, hey, this the time of my life from 66 is probably the time for me to just lay low. Does stand up sometimes and that's a great idea. That's even better. Yeah. Go do that then and show us some of my farming videos, listen to people like to know about how to grow food and I'm really good at growing food. When you do stand up and you go on a tour, I think it's going to be hugely successful. I really do. I think people are going to come out in droves and I think it's going to be awesome and I think once you get your legs under you and you start doing a few shows and get things cracking again, you'd be like the Rosanna. Do you be crushing it?

Speaker 1:          02:04:08       I was crushing it. I have to say in my tour of Canada, I was crushing. It was a blast I had. Oh my God, I just had the most fun, you know, get like 90 minutes of beautiful control over, you know, bing, bing, bing, and I, I've got like a big laugh every 90 seconds and beautiful, you know, I tailor it and craft it and love it. Love the people that come out to see me. Then five diverse crowd too, which is great. Well, I bet it'd be even more diverse now while it's going to be way better I think, because I'm going to really start talking about the real me, such as my abhorrence and fear of serpents. Serpents. Oh yeah. I always have been. Don't go to Florida now. I won't, don't go to the swamps for sure. You heard about what's going on there?

Speaker 1:          02:04:57       What with people releasing pythons all know over decades. You didn't know. Florida is overrun with pythons. Oh my God. Non Native Pythons because people released them as pets and then they moved to the swamps and bread. Yeah, they've eaten everything. There's almost no mammals in the swamps. Oh my God. Said 99 percent of all raccoons are gone. We couldn't find any marsh rabbits. They couldn't find any bobcat's and the pythons and started eating alligators. Oh, thousands of them out there. Say the world's gone nuts. Crazy. Stay away from Florida. I, well, I had A. I had a turtle that kind of felt. Are we done? No, I mean we can be done or we can keep going. Well, I had this turtle that fell in love with me wanting to meet with me and Hawaii. You know, it's so weird. Now. This is true. I'm really afraid of serpents.

Speaker 1:          02:05:49       Okay. So, uh, so I go in the ocean there and my friends, they're like, don't touch the turtles. There's a $5,000 fine or something. You don't touch those big old things. Sound like, you know, like I say, I'm a Jew. So as soon as I hear that, I'm like, yeah, well fuck them. I'm catching it. So I did. And then it turned, it went and started swimming around me and then it went in this big circle and it's head came out of the water in it side. I me, I was like, oh Christ, it's the serpent. I've been afraid of my own life. And he chased me onto the shore. She goes, that's why we don't touch the turtles, because they bond with you. Like this guy wants me to. Merriam. Yeah. If you touch them, they like you. They're like, hey, she'll go for it as a terrifying. I've seen them in the water. They're fucking cool to look at. Their swimming are awesome. They're like a little Volkswagen with these four paddles, serpent head coming out and like this where they look. So my, that's how I left it locked eyes with. Yeah, he did like this side by side.

Speaker 1:          02:07:10       They go side. I'll. No, no, it was terrible to think of. Terrifying. Yeah. I've never gotten back in that water. Well yeah I could see where that would be a problem and I have a lot of serpent things. And also like when I see people I can see if they're a serpent or not. You know how they say the Reptilian. Like I told my kids this the hardest thing ever. Type Shit. Well I really do see them now. I sort

Speaker 8:          02:07:36       of believe him. He's gone down a rabbit hole. That guy. It's more like a, like a gopher hole somewhere real deep into the core of the earth. But he talks about that stuff anymore. Now he kinda laid it back. But that's because I confronted him. Dude, you just lost it. Yeah, well that's what I was doing on twitter too as a DM and people going, you've lost it. Yeah. It's fun. Like I did it. And so I used to do these, a faithful or crank phone calls before they got that star 69 and I was married to what's his face then the Elf. And uh, he came in the room there and he told me he stopped doing it and he looked at my address book and I was, I was calling a general Schwarzkopf to do it to him and he's like, you don't crank called general work because I had all these numbers.

Speaker 8:          02:08:35       Anyway. So, uh, what was I saying? Yeah, I used to do that, but then I went to the DM, you know, on, that's the way people like, just get them riled up that way. Just go, come on, you're losing it. You will have David [inaudible] said that like all the big major world figures, really secretly Reptilian reptilian shape shifters and shit, and I told my kids, here's what I told my kids, just the hardest thing I'll ever tell you, but, and I didn't know so I couldn't help but at the time, but I recently found out that your dad is reptilian joke, but sort of a joke, but they are half a million, but I can see like people becoming the reptile, like I'll see them and their head goes up like this, like on tv, their head, their neck goes out like this and then the tongue comes out on the corner to let go up like that. They do it. I see it on tv all the time. I see that all them devil worshipers. Who Do you go to? Those devil worship parties here they're talking about and Hollywood is devil worship to a wedding. Was it a devil worship? What is his name? Anton Levay. Sorry. Was a devil worship for Napa. Like motherfucker, like people call me a Satan worshiper now because of it. Oh my God. And

Speaker 3:          02:09:59       Dunkin. This was like 15 years ago, my friend Duncan used to have this puppet called Little Hobo and he would do this, uh, this hilarious bit at the end of his comedy show where Little Hobo was his grandfather's puppet and his, his grandfather died. And, uh, his grandfather's last wish with that. He bring little Hobo on stage with them. One more time in the pub would come to life. There's, there's Daca with little Hobo. Little Hobo was this fucked up look at pub. It was a hilarious bit. It's funny. Anton [inaudible] grandson. Is that who it was? Their son was getting married as Duncan to perform

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       at his party. So me and a bunch of my friends all went to see Dunkin perform at this bizarre Satanists party. It was very strange. It was in Hollywood. It was like there's a concert and hang the third, Hank Williams a third performed there. And it was kind of fun, but it was bizarre. And uh, so there's like a picture with me and the guy and people saying with Satan worshiper now you're not. Definitely not. Oh my God. You look like a St Louis should have got a. someone's hands you the gun on the left with the hair. Oh my God. That's me. You got to get some better glasses. Bama. I can't tell them exactly like me, but anyway. No, I promise you no, no. Satan worshiping. No, no worshiping period. There's some real. I'm sure crazy people out here that definitely really are. Yeah. I'm glad you didn't stay in with them.

Speaker 1:          02:11:33       I went to one stupid fucking party because my friend Duncan fucking Duncan getting in trouble. You son of a bitch. Um, what else? What were we just talking about when we were talking about Satan worshipers? You were saying something. Oh, lizard people. So who's the lizard people whose. Well you just say nobody's name. Okay. But I'll tell you, I can't say, but uh, if you really take a hard long look when they're talking to me some names for that net going up and they had twisting and then the term coming out corner. Okay. I'll keep an eye on. So you're saying I'll keep an eye out for it. We'll listen. Roseanne. Thank you. This was a lot of fun. It was fun. I think people got a chance to see the real you.
