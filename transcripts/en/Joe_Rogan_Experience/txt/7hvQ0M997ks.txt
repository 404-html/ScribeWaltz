Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hello Freak bitches. That's right. We're back and this episode, once again, is brought to you by Squarespace. If you have a company, if you have a business, if you are a business, say if you're an entertainer or maybe an artist and you have something you'd like to let the world know about it, there is no better way to do it. Then with your own website and for the longest time that was a pain in the Dick. You had to go find someone that you could reliably count on to make you a nice website and they they put didn't put weird backdoors in it with a good sneak Dick pics and all your photographs or fuck with you and take too much time and cost you too much money and were were were, were, were. When you rely on people, it's great when it works out, it's awesome when you, when you find someone like, Oh, I found this guy and he's great with websites and he's my friend.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Yay, it's awesome. It's fun, but when it's a pain in the ass and when it's not going well, you go, God, I wish I could do this myself. Well, yeah, it can.

Ting is a cell phone company that does things in a way that I think is the future tings. A website where you can go there. First of all, if you, if you look at like the, the big cell phone providers, whether it's a sprint or whether it's a Verizon or at, and, t, one of the things that bothers people is early termination fees like can get getting hooked into a contract.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       The reason why you do that and uh, it's very convenient for, you know, for most of us because what they're doing is instead of paying the full amount for a cell phone, usually like it says it's two 99 but 60 99 if you want to buy it on its own. Yeah, that's, that's the different thing that to 99, when you buy it with like a two year contract, if you break that contract, you have to pay that money. What you're doing sort of deferring that money over a long period of time and if you want to get out, he can't get out. You're like, Shit. Um, ting has it so you can get out of anytime you want. You buy the phone, you own the phone, they sell the best android phones you can buy, including the Samsung Galaxy note three, which I have. It's awesome phone.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       So the really cool, you can write on it. It's got a little stylus and shit. The images are gigantic for going on the web. It's fucking unparalleled. There's nothing like it. Like an iPhone is great for usability and you can bring your iPhones also, um, from sprint and they can pour them to tank and then they sell the iPhone five for 260 bucks. You can actually buy it for 260 bucks and then it's yours. You own that shit son. No contract. Yeah. And the way 10 uses it to 98% of people would save money using tank. That's their claim, not mine. Cause I'm no statistic Titian it's, it's at us. Titian it's my note three is about

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       one eighth of my cell phone price for my iPhone. Yeah, it's pretty cheap. I think I pay on average about 20 bucks a month.

Speaker 3:          00:06:05       It's a $21 a month is the average month monthly bill. So you have an average bill

Speaker 4:          00:06:09       below average like northern walls. 440

Speaker 3:          00:06:14       bucks is the average annual savings per device for a business with 11 to 20 employees. It's pretty sweet. Um, and I said, like I said, all of the best android cell phones, no termination fees. Go to Rogan dot [inaudible] dot com and you can save 25 bucks off your first device. 10 uses the sprint backlog backbone. So it's not like it's some wonky ass cell phone network. They use one of the best cell phone networks in the world. And the sprint backbone is you give the exact same sub service and coverage that you would if you had sprint, but you're using a ting device and you can quit any time you want and it's all set up on their terms. An ethical company providing you with an awesome service and everyone that I've talked to about it, they've all loved it. Chris Ryan uses it. Brian uses it. It's a sweet, easy way to save money.

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       Nowadays you're always on a wifi network because you're usually always at home or you're always at work and stuff like that. So a lot of people are on these plans now that don't make any sense because no one's really making phone calls anymore. You remember when it minutes were a big thing. No one's, everyone's texting now and you're, if you're texting and you're connected to your Wifi, a lot of these phones will just like, Oh, you're, you're just using this wifi network. You're not even using tings network. So

Speaker 4:          00:07:27       I think it's important to still talk to people on the phone. I really do. I think we're getting a little weird, a little weird. We go days in and you know, it talks to us like, look, you only just text all your friends. I mean maybe there's some benefit to that sometimes when you want to decompress, but I think for the most part we should probably talk to each other every now and again. It is interesting. It's like we're going backwards. I'm one of the to stuff it and just go carrier pigeon or raising like in game of Thrones, that's going to be the mode that's going to be the coolest guy in the neighborhood. The guy that gets it has the first raven that's trained to drop stuff off somewhere. It's going to be, how hard is it to train up fucking raven. Didn't want to listen to what, all right.

Speaker 4:          00:08:04       I think could go anywhere. They can do anything fly and the fucking smart and it's not, I'm like, there's no food. Right. You know, they can find food. They don't need to listen to your bullshit or an animal. So smart to travel long distances. You think they'd be smart enough to realize they don't have to take that shit. You know, they could just go do whatever they want. You know, it's a really fucked up feeling or a thought rather. What if that's how Raven's involved evolved their intelligence cause ravens are so smart, they do all these multistep process tests where raven has to get a stick and use the stick to get a bigger stick and use that bigger stick to get an even larger stick cause they're all down these long tubes. So the Raven keeps figuring out that as it gets longer sticks, he can reach and scoop the law, the stick that's longer than that and pull it out and then drop it and then use that one to get a piece of meat. And they do it Loos like seven or eight steps and you watch it and ego. That is freaking me the fuck out. That thing is smart at Shit. Yeah. They're probably so smart

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       that they figured out how to not have to be the male Guy Anymore or Ravens and crows the same. Um, I, that's a very good question. I think not. Yeah. But it seems like it should be right. Or Ravens and crows as shame. I think they're both blackbirds but, uh, that's just the word just being racist. Racist. No, it's a good question. I'll read from what parts are all this year or Ravens and crows. The Samsung Different since treating crows and ravens. There was a crow fight my backyard a couple of weeks ago and I had crow was injured in Atlanta in my backyard and I couldn't get out, kind of fly anymore, so I just wanted to go out, you know, take my dog out to go to the bathroom. And the second I would come out, all the crows and neighborhood would just start going crazy. Like swooping down, like trying to protect the injured one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Their smartest shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's weird. Like we think of him as just birds, but they're like a little gang. They're a gang of little flying monkeys. Um, this is the, the, the explanation. A raven is a bigger version of a crow, although they are the same species. A Raven has common name given to the largest species of birds in the genus. Core of us. Corvids are commonly referred to as Chros and other species in the same genus you see, Janice or Jenice gives you say Janice. Right? That's why I only read though. I never say like Gina's, it doesn't really come up. If you use genus, had a conversation, you're a Douche. She totally, unless you're a biologist and he's a genius and you're like, what are you doing? You stop it. You just stop. Cut Your fucking fanciness. Little there for him. The genius. Um, corvids. Okay, so that's what it is. And uh, they're the same, uh, Jean needs as Jack Dawes and rooks. I don't know what any of those birds are. There you go. So now you know, go to wikipedia.org and look up ravens and that's it. Ting rogan.tank.com. Awesome cell phone company.

Speaker 5:          00:10:52       I love that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       25 bucks. Boom. Schelok lock. Boom. Oh, I'm Ian Edwards has a new CD that's out right now and it's on the team. Coco label team coco meaning of course the great Conan O'brien has his own record label, I guess. And he's, I'm putting out, this is the first one. Yeah. And Ian Edwards, our friend, fucking a hundred percent awesome. He calls, uh, his, his CD's called 100% halfassed and it's Ian sitting on the edge of his bed. Two would stand up cause that's where he'd like to be able to do his dad though. He's just a super funny dude and one of the nicest guys I know and I've known Ian Forever and he's just cool as shit.

We don't need any other fucking goddamn advertisements. Cue The music. Go to [inaudible] dot com brain with Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 6:          00:12:23       Joe Rogan podcast my night. Good

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       googly Mooglie, Tony Hinchcliffe, googly mooglie fresh back from Indiana, letting those middle America people know what the fuck is up. Middle America is a lot like middle earth in some ways. You know, you know, middle earth like where the hobbits lived, the good folk wasn't middle earth like the cool people. That's where the uh, the hobbits where I don't know about that,

Speaker 7:          00:12:51       but I do know that Indianapolis, I learned something this weekend about Indianapolis and that's that it's like the south of the Midwest. Southern a lot of ways. Yeah. It's amazing though because it's pretty much straight uh, west of Columbus. But they're like, and they were laughing about it so I'm not insulting them, but there are a lot more like a hook, a hook. Then the city is around them. Like you just go a few miles down the road and all of a sudden it's all about racing and it's all about guns and a lot of Camo shorts I saw cause it's starting to be summer there. So

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       yeah, there are, there's a lot of country music lovers there, Kentucky. Like you'd never think that Kentucky's right next to Cincinnati. Yeah. You know, like you think of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, wk Rp. Remember that show with Loni Anderson. You think of Cincinnati is like a city. You think of Kentucky as, Oh man. What's going on down there? A lot of Banjo picking and moonshine making barbecue and

Speaker 6:          00:13:47       woo.

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       You don't think it's right, right next to Cincinnati and Cincinnati airports in Kentucky. Oh it is? Yeah. And you land in Kentucky. They call it the Cincinnati airport because they're ashamed they're in Kentucky. That's so sad. And I'm like, you know Kentucky people. Kentucky's awesome. Louisville is awesome. You Know Kentucky Fried Chicken. All right. You guys are known for Bourbon. Like you guys make some great shit. Kentucky's were Corvettes are made the, they make all their Corvettes and Kentucky, Jeremy Clarkson, the guy from top gear who's driving this corvette and uh, he, he likes yelled out like while I was driving it, well done fad man from Kentucky, you have created a masterpiece that you're going to, if he's going to yell out the n word or, so he did that later. He did that though. That poor bastard. People have hubris man. They think they can say things like that.

Speaker 7:          00:14:38       I read something cool about Kentucky Fried Chicken since you brought it up. I'm going to say it, it's a the kernel like whoever the actual KFC guy was his protege or like the person who he trained underneath him. Favorite guy coming up the ranks of like fast food, uh, helped him out a lot. Like chain made some major decisions was the guy that told him put the chicken in a bucket instead of a box. This guy was Dave Thomas who then went on to make all the Wendy's

Speaker 4:          00:15:05       Whoa, powerful, fast food conspiracy theory. But it's a fact like some shit that your friends told you when you were in high school. It turned out to be totally false, but you repeated forever. Nabisco is owned by the same people who make missiles. They're trying to kill you one way or another, bro. It's either with cupcakes or with missiles.

Speaker 7:          00:15:28       Well, it is the same company that makes cigarettes. Nabisco is RJ Reynolds and Rjr Nabisco. Rj R is RJ rental.

Speaker 4:          00:15:37       Impossible. The people feeding you Twinkies would not hate what you did. Is that Nabisco where they Twinkies and the Bisco have Twinkies? No. Who had Twinkies and hostess. Hostess. It's not the same, but it could be under the same painful, but Nabisco is, I'm known as being like, you know, if you think of like snacks, right? You think of like something that's Yummy but not necessarily good for you. I picture the Nilla wafers. I remember those. Yeah. What did they have that's like real bullshit. No. Pisco Pisco. They have some good chocolate chip cookies. Yeah, right? Yeah. The Bisco some good God, they got the chip Keebler elves on their side. I do believe, check this out. Dave Thomas and Colonel Sanders. Uh, both guy, uh, they both won first place and they tied a for who split? Who could best fried chicken. Wow. Dave Thomas' chicken. Why doesn't Dave Thomas, just so, I mean he's dead now, but when he was alive, why didn't you sell chicken at one day?

Speaker 4:          00:16:32       He did. There was a test market. Uh, what they do. So checking in when he's, but there was a Tuscan sandwiches. They don't yet, you can't get it like a bucket of chicken. There was a test market company that Wendy's started that I only think stayed in Columbus or at least Ohio called sister's chicken. I don't know if you think it, it sounds, I remember that. And they, they actually were way better than Kentucky Fried Chicken. They had these little chicken littles and, Oh man, it was a chicken littles like, uh, like uh, you know, get, it was, it was like white castles, but with chicken. Oh, this is like the Steve jobs of fast. He figured out a lot of shit with Wendy's. Yeah. Like you really did. Like one of the things was that the food is never frozen. Like if you, if you get a steak or a hamburger patty steak, if you got a hamburger patty from any other place, it's usually frozen.

Speaker 4:          00:17:16       And they just sorta like, if you look at some of them, they didn't even look like meat, like white castle. It doesn't even look like me. Right. So confusing you looking at what a white castle burger is. It's delicious. But you're like, what the fuck am I eating? But if you look at Wendy's like they can, they get their patties, they're big, thick patties and they get them and they just, they don't, they don't ever freeze them. They just throw them right onto the grill, which has gotta be better. Right? Yeah. The less you can free shit you got. Think like when you're eating things, you're kind of taking in like live cultures. Like if you eat yogurt, you taken live bacteria, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       and when you eat like anything, whether it's um, whether it's, um, the, any kinds of foods sort of have like some sort of bacteria fungus on it, just a slight amount. And so when you're taking them in, you're taking in like living things whenever you just totally freezing

Speaker 4:          00:18:06       fuck out of living things ever good. I just can't be good. There's something, something's got to be missing there. I don't, I mean, I'm no scientist, but I think when you freeze it till it's like literally it doesn't rot. Like just, it's not supposed to happen. That's supposed to be fucked. Yeah. You know, like if you have crops and your crops freeze, you're supposed to be fucked. You know? That's what it's supposed to be. It's not supposed to be free shit. And you're eating like frozen peas. Like what does, what does even in those things, that shit ain't a regular p that's got to cut something. Right. And that stuff gets frozen on the surface of a thing. I would like to see a sign

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       ticket analysis, maybe I'm totally wrong, but I would from my Wu wolf bro Woo factor, how I would describe it, uh, I would say you're losing the essence of the life form of plant. Once you freeze it and kill it, everything's dead. Like that's the reason why it's not rotting is all that bacteria that would normally break down anything that you leave out and it starts to decay. That's all on the surface of that anyway. Right? I mean, it just takes time to rot.

Speaker 4:          00:19:07       That's what it is. Thoughts that you have some dead bacteria instead of live bacteria on the surface of your thing.

Speaker 3:          00:19:13       Yeah, that's gotta be part of it. I mean, isn't that, that is what like taking live cultures, it was all about like everybody wants to eat probiotic stuff like probiotic. I have some probiotic Sauerkraut, man, it was amazing. What does probiotic mean? It means it's rotting like probiotic. Sauerkraut is, it's like, it's almost like carbonated. You ever have that stuff? It's like fermented. Oh, I've had it. Yeah. It's really good. I love it. It's delicious and super good for you. It's like a lot of people don't know like raw sauerkraut is fucking really good for you. Oh yeah. It's a, it's got a live thing you're taking into your body and that live cultures very good for fighting off diseases and for balancing your stomach and for, there's a lot of people that they're connecting him with autism and a lot of ways because a lot of people with autism also have a bowel issues and gut issues and they think that uh, it could possibly be connected to like a wrong balance of bacteria in your body. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:20:09       Which is fascinating man. Yeah. Sauerkrauts one of the few things that is good for you and completely delicious at the same crazy is that like it makes a hot dog 50% better, easily sausage. He could put it. Any is Tony Making Sauerkraut? It's one of those foods where you could like smell it and picture it right in front of you. The good like Brown, seedy mustard. Oh. Or figure that out. Like all the other vegetables must to be so jealous. They don't get to be on the hot dogs. You get like pickles and you know, it's like cucumbers and Sauerkraut. Those are the happy ones. Every once in tomatoes kind of bullshit on my cheeseburger. Totally. The

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       fuck is that. All those cool vegetables hate on the lettuce and tomatoes. Why should let us into men will be allowed to be on a cheeseburger like, Ooh, it's per tune. This is healthy. Let us is less than nothing. What's the difference between our bratwurst and a sausage? That's a good question. Maybe it's a niche. It must be the preparation right? In Ohio. Bratwurst were everywhere. Like there was restaurants that specialize in brought where's here? I'm always looking for a broad words. Now you can only find sausages or hot dogs. There's gotta be a place. I know you can get them at the store. I think bratwurst might be a little bit of a smokey or flavor. That's my guests going into it. I have no idea. That's talk sausage, Ravens and sausages. Okay. The same difference

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       is this between a square and a rectangle. What? You've just broken a bratwurst. Okay. This is the weirdest. Again, whatever the guys had. A square is a rectangle, but a rectangle is not a square. Oh, I see. Um, so is a bratwurst a sausage. But any sauce where is not a bratwurst brought worst. Our pork sausage with a medium grind spiced mainly with pepper sausage is any ground meat in casing. Hmm. So it seems like it's a sausage. It's just a different type of sausage that's saw. It is, I mean it's, it's a pork sausage. You can call it a bratwurst all you want. That's a creepy word to WHO's, what is that? Yeah, German tours. What do you think caused certain parts of the world to develop that sound like that? Like when you get like weird sounds brothel or weird fucking language sounds, those sounds that people in that region made like what kind, what got them to do that?

Speaker 8:          00:22:33       It's crazy. It's like they think the opposite of us. Like, Oh, I'm in American, I annunciate my, you know what I mean? Like that's what's crazy is we look at them like they're weird and they look, imagine how weird we sound. Like, if you think of what they sound like and what we sound like, their perspective must be like, I must sound like where like singing things because it's so pure.

Speaker 3:          00:22:54       Well, we're a fascinating example for the rest of the world because if you look at all the other English languages in the world, they all are pretty similar. Australian and New Zealand. I mean, I've got a good day. You know, they got a little bit of a difference, but it still sounds like an English accent. It's like an altered English accent. Whereas we got over here and went,

Speaker 5:          00:23:11       Nah, not so much. No, we're going to say it our way. Fuck base, and we're going to make more bombs and we're gonna make it tell everybody talks your waist weird. Now you're going to have to learn our way. The English language is quite weird because you're somewhere and you're talking to a man. He's still talking about this. So I'm having a hard time understanding you right now. That's not English. This is English fucker here. That nice and clean. No fucking words slurring into the next word like word soup. You're going to Goddamn word, food, train, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          00:23:44       We're perfect over here in America. You know how to rocket. We fucking got took your language and linseed it. We made it better. See your language bitch. Who's our shooter of the day? I haven't heard yet today. I hope they catch him. Flocker, man, it's got an ugly dude that north Hollywood shit was crazy. That dude, the North Hollywood thing for folks who don't know, there was a man on a roof and I thought I saw it from Eliza slushing jurors. Twitter. Eliza slessinger was torturing her ex boyfriend, uh, on a, on Twitter. She dated a guy slessinger that made up a complete total history. He said his mom was dying. His mom was fine. There's nothing wrong with mom. Said he went to the Yale. He never went to Yale. He said he was starting up all these businesses. The guy was like $100,000 in debt. Like he, he was like living with roommates. Like he was just, he totally fabricated as super successful. Eliza Schlesinger got Sarah Tiana, she got Sarah. Tiana said, Whoa, she got Sarah Tiana and hardcore, but she was going off on our Twitter and then I saw something about, shoot the guy on the roof. And I'm like, what kind? The roof? Like, you know, she was saying, kill that fucking guy. She's so crazy. And then I went and then I started looking, uh, looking up stories. What exactly is the, the full cool?

Speaker 2:          00:25:03       Well, what pretty much happened is it started off as a police chase and then it went on. Like it was one of those ones that just went on every single highway. And the guy finally got out out in north Hollywood and he just got out of his car. And when he, he was driving, he was holding out a big, uh, rifle. Hey automated rifle, just like hanging out the window. And so, uh, he pulls his car over in north Hollywood and he gets out of his car and he pulls out this huge gun and he just starts walking down North Hollywood with his gun. And then he gets on top of a roof of a house. And then at that time, that's when I tuned in because I saw Eliza tweet also, and then I thought he was just going to shoot himself, but he just, for about 20 minutes, he was on top of a roof with a gun and then he comes down off the roof and he breaks into this house.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       Luckily there was nobody home and he just sat in the house for about four hours. That's when it like the movie, I mean the, the real life just completely became boring. Like there's, so the news for like three hours or however long it was just repeating the same thing over and over for three hours. Finally they got the Swat team all around the house and they shot in a bunch of containers, uh, of smoke or whatever, pure gas. And the guy just walks out. But what was the coolest thing is that the two police dogs just came running up to him, sniffed his leg, and then sat down right next to him. Like just like, hey, we're waiting for a whistle before we just chew your Dick Apart, you know? And the guy just like, you know, surrendered. So it was a really crazy beginning part of the movie or thing and then it just sucked at the end. Well it seems like more hours, you know, problem where we

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       have a short attention span, we want all live, all these live altercations to go down as if they're a 90 minute movie that we can pay attention to.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Yeah. But I mean just yesterday there was somebody in Vegas, the, I don't know if you saw the Walmart incident that happened in or the day before and do you think this is copycat shit, I, I think something's going on man. Cause this, I was talking about it four days ago. Like how we'd been having a shooter every day. There was that guy in Canada that I don't even know if they ever caught in Canada. The guy that was just had like three guns and he was going through neighborhoods, shooting cops and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:27:15       Yeah. He was shooting those guys who look like Bullwinkle's buddy. Yeah. They dress like bowling legals pal. Canadian royal mounties. Yeah they, it's a horrible story. You shot like three of them up there and someone I met someone who knew that guy, I can't remember the exact thing, but they, they uh, weren't surprised.

Speaker 2:          00:27:35       It seems like it is kind of like a weird copycat thing now because I mean we'd been having it ever since the Santa Barbara Douchebag.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       Well, there's a lot of people out there that are probably on the edge and it just takes one thing like that to push them.

Speaker 7:          00:27:49       Yeah. The, the, the, the school things with these that, you know, like I saw a part of that kid's video where he's like, I'm going to keep them all. And it's like terrifying. He was talking like he was doing something much bigger than shooting a few people. He was saying things like, oh, you're all going to, you know, I'm going to show America or the world, like he's talking on such a grand scale. And uh, I think that they really think that it's even bigger than it is and that they're like a hero or something. Like they're going to be remembered for that.

Speaker 3:          00:28:20       Well, they know that that's the thing that people are most afraid of. So you can cause that thing to happen. You become famous. I mean it's that simple and they equate in their head being famous in that way is having an impact. And you know, obviously the guy had a huge impact with all the people's families that he killed. That guy just drove around and killed his three roommates. What was fascinating, it was that that became this like a woman's rights sort of a Hashtag. Yes. All women, you know, or uh, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say woman rights, like awareness, awareness of a violence that women face. And I got admitted. It makes you think about it in a different way that the, that hashtags a great hashtag. Yes. All women. Because not all men have to worry about the things that women have to worry about. Like you don't have to worry about being raped by checks. You don't have to worry about, you know, like women beating you up or women's stealing things from you or women trying to rape you. You don't have to worry about it. But women have to worry about it from men. Like it's a whole different world they live in. You know, it's, it's hard to think about when you're live in your world, you know, your world's pretty easy. You're super between,

Speaker 7:          00:29:27       right. Well yeah, I was going to on about 130 pounds, so I'm pretty sure I can be raped in any given point. I know a little hashtags should be yes. All women. Antonia hint, I know what it's like to be a woman. Or do you when uh, someone

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       said that from the WHO? Pete Townsend said that, so he knows what it's like to be a woman. Oh, what is a woman? Really? Yeah. It was some crazy claim or some crazy, a statement about, uh, you know, haven't had bisexual experience. The towns, it's one of those guys, like if you do a little research, he has some crazy stuff about him, but he can get away with anything because he's the lead guitarist from the hill and he does that windmill thing and you know, when you're that cool you could be crazy. But he has like some crazy history. He got investigated for child pornography. Yeah. And uh, he said that he was doing it for some sort of a research project or something like that. It was researching child pornography. So in doing so he's searching for it.

Speaker 9:          00:30:21       Yeah. I don't remember what the project was that he was involved with that he was saying he was involved with, but that's kind of fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       There's one woman that could beat up. You were talking about there's no, that guys can get raped by women and stuff like that. Did you see that woman that beat up that little 17 year old kid and he filmed the whole thing on the Connecticut beach. There's chicks like that out there while she was beating him up. Yeah. There's this woman in Connecticut. He was flying when those little toy drones on the beach and uh, it has little cameras in it and she thought she crazy woman like, oh, he's recording us like it's illegal or something to do that. And she started like calling the police and he started filming it on his iPhone, what she was doing. And right when she got off the phone with the police, like she's like, you better get here. I got him right now because I felt and just starts beating this kid up and he's filming the whole thing like that. After I saw this video, I actually had to go in the other room and just sit down cause I was, my heart was racing so hard. I just want you to kill somebody after watching. You should w would you like to look at it?

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       Really you? You're fucking this woman. I want to find this woman. I want to find this woman. This is going to drive you crazy. Okay. Let's see here. Okay, check it. Love this. Yes. Make me mad. You had to go sit in another room because your heart was beating him. Okay, buddy.

Speaker 10:         00:31:31       Brilliant.

Speaker 9:          00:31:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:38       Andrew Mirrors 23 did not appreciate this man flying his drone on the beach. She was under the impression she had an air pack perception of privacy on a public page,

Speaker 9:          00:31:46       pictures and try and upload them from a or from a para. Can you guys get here at Hammonasset at now realizing this video recording her. He's taking pictures of people on the beach with like with a helicopter plane. Wow. Can you guys

Speaker 5:          00:32:01       video kept him from getting arrested cause she said that he had assaulted her dude. They released him after they showed the video from the iPhone.

Speaker 10:         00:32:09       Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

Speaker 5:          00:32:13       I know it gets so fucked up. Well right now all you're seen is this kid holding onto his equipment and the woman is a confronting him. He's trying to put his equipment away.

Speaker 10:         00:32:24       You're a thought layman. You asked why? Oh whoa. She's like really hard to see what's happening here.

Speaker 9:          00:32:42       Yeah, I think this is fake. No, it's not. The woman was arrested. Is this on the news and what is this guy doing? That's a weird half guard looking at her hands are ripping it there. His mouth. Yeah. She's putting her hands in his mouth and he's filming it the entire time. Like as a selfie. Smart. It's hilarious actually. Oh my God, this girl's crazy. She got terrible half guard. If you weren't assaulting me, I wouldn't be touching. You want to stop assaulting me? Get off of me. Call the cops. I me. It's not bad.

Speaker 10:         00:33:29       Wow.

Speaker 9:          00:33:31       He's just totally playing. All right. He's not really scared. She just happy that he's filming all this. Please get off of me.

Speaker 10:         00:33:43       Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:33:47       That make video. It makes me crazy. This is photography's not a crime. It's amazing that he got that. Why does that make you so mad to me? It's funny because I've been in situations psych. Hi. Yeah. I mean, it's funny is he wasn't in danger. He was doing this the whole time. He wasn't like, he was like making sure he filmed this girl beating the shit out of him. Right. Like you didn't even like stop or defend himself. He wasn't scared. I had been in domestic violence plate things before though and Shit. That shit where she could have just said, yeah, he attacked me and stuff like that shit. Now he did say that like, that's why I know that your situation drives me nuts. That's back where it makes me want to have a Gopro on the recording all day. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:34:26       no. Yeah, the salted by chicks all day long. Brian's upload and all day it'd be like chicks punching up, holding him down in the parking lot and kicking the ball and he just wasn't telling us about these get over me. He was just keeping all these from us cause he was talking about it on this show. It's like, you know, every day another one I'm going to bring it up. No fuck are they going to make fun of me all day? Just

Speaker 4:          00:34:52       chics beating his ass. Yeah. I don't know man. I mean she's obviously an asshole, but he was like letting her get away with it on purpose. It is amazing. It is amazing. Five, 10 years ago that same thing happens. That's 17 year old who was just flying his plane on a beach, ends up going to jail because if a woman does say this guy assaulted me and the cops come there and they see his shirt half ripped as if she was in a defensive position. You know what I mean? Absolutely. It's amazing. There's no doubt. There's no doubt. Well she said that she, that he was assaulted or that he assaulted her brother. They showed the video and that's what got him off. So I think that she's obviously a crazy person and would lie, but I think that's normal for people to beat your ass.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       Like people that beat your ass like that, like physically beat your ass to fucking crazy. They're crazy. Of course they're going to lie. They're telling the truth. They're fucked up. There are a mess. Like that's gotta be the hardest thing about being a cop. He's like, you're showing up and two people are beating the fuck out of each other. You've got to figure out who did what. And you always got to side with the woman who Scott Simpson law. It's what they nicknamed. And the reason why you get aside with a woman, it's cause it's like, let's reverse that scenario. If that guy had been beating that girl up, it wouldn't be funny at all. Right. But it was funny to me watching that guy.

Speaker 6:          00:36:08       Yeah. To me while he's Selfie, come on.

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       I think that's funny. I would not think it's funny if it was a man doing it to a woman. Right? Because I would worry the woman's going to really get hurt. I wasn't worried about him getting hurt there. I mean, she wasn't even strong enough to hurt him. You never know man. He was only 17

Speaker 6:          00:36:25       I was a grown adult like selfie himself, probably a grape timid.

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       She wanted to know. I think that kid is smart that he didn't fight back. I just very smart and it'll, all he did was defend himself. Very smart. He's a smart kid, obviously. She can't just go around doing that like, yeah, you probably shouldn't fucking fly your drone in to people's houses can film them. You shouldn't hover over their backyard with a trying to Suntan and filling them. I don't know what he was doing this, it's a weird thing. This, this idea that you could put a camera on top of a little like robot and fly it around because when we were filming that Scifi show, we had some dudes that were really good at it. They had like these high tech drones and we were fucking around with them and putting on these goggles and the virtual reality goggles. You put them on and you feel like you're flying like this drone, you're going over the tree tops and I was like this is going to get real weird cause this isn't super expensive stuff like you're looking at this, this is like, I mean I don't know a couple thousand bucks or something like that to get a rig like this.

Speaker 3:          00:37:20       I don't know. I don't know how many thousand. I'm just guessing but it didn't look to be like prohibitively expensive. It's not like something that costs 50 grand or something like that. I think you could get it for the price of some toys that people save up and buy. Like there's a lot of people that can have a fucking flying robot that films everything now they have it at Fry's for like 30 bucks.

Speaker 6:          00:37:39       Really cheap. Well I don't know. Technology is crazy when that's like in the eye on the checkout area, on your way out. Grab a drone. I don't think it's the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       Level of sophistication that these guys had. These guys had, like I said, virtual reality cameras attached to 'em and they're pretty sophisticated but they have a real problem with how long they can stay up in the air. They can't stay up in the air very long. They just, they just can't do it. They're just the out of gas and they fall. You could load them up with batteries but then that batteries is weight and it makes it harder for them to fly so they, they need to work around that. I think they can only stay up for like 30 minutes or something like that. Maybe there's some that can do it better, but when you're watching one fly over the tree tops and you wearing one of those goggles, it's a trip, dude. It's a freaky feeling. You're like, wow, this is nuts. This is like what it's like to be an eagle. You know? They get that shit really, really good. It's going to be nuts. If they can develop some super clear, like get some something that wraps around your head, right? Like this, like your entire field division out like this is all this, you know the screen and then figure out some way to film something and not have it make any noise so you don't hear it. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       You, you somehow or another they can make something that doesn't make noise.

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       Yeah. These drones, there's a really cool music video or if not music video, but just a video of a guy throwing, doing a drone over Los Angeles and he goes like on top of the capital records building, you could see like the roof and stuff like that. It, he goes over like the Hollywood hills parties. Like that house that's above the comedy store and there's people having a party up there and he's just going right over people with beach balls. There's Jim Henson's a studios he just flew over. See? That's weird. Yeah. That's kind of weird. Especially like say if you have like an ex boyfriend or an ex girlfriend

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       beside the fucking fly, a drone around your house and film you while you're fucking the next person

Speaker 4:          00:39:28       you know, get mad at you, you fucking piece of shit. You didn't even wait a month, wasn't expecting you to be watching me with your drone. Drone introduced me to the truth. You're a piece of shit. Fucking deflect deflecting. When I bought you the drone, I didn't think you were going to be spying on me. I thought you'd trust me like the arguments of the future. Do you think

Speaker 2:          00:40:00       speed used by like perverts and Papa razzies nowadays like just going up in hotels with little cameras and drones and stuff. Cause look at this. This is like HD. Look at this party that's on top of this hotel. Look at these people are just having a party in and it's drones flying over. People start noticing the journey to start throwing like beach balls at it and stuff. They made in certain places where it's legal to shoot them in Colorado. There was a town in Colorado that past some sort of a resolution that allow you to shoot at drones. Wow. That's so, yeah. It's going to be like a video game. We're going to have be like shooting drones everyday. Here's comminsure. Look about going above the comedy store. I've been there. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       Top of the, this uh, Colorado town. Apparently they're just considering it. They haven't done it totally as of March 31st but it's deer trail, Colorado and uh, there's 563 people in the town. They're worried about it.

Speaker 4:          00:40:58       You should be worried about getting it up to 600 people. You're fucking town as tiny as shit. Your town isn't even a small theater. That's ridiculous. How do you guys have your own laws? That seems preposterous that a town that little like you driving through and the law changes and then you go to the other side, the law's different. Get the fuck out of here. The law is different in that you've got 563 people. That's a cult. Okay. That's a cult. You got a call.

Speaker 3:          00:41:21       You do not have a town. You fucking Weirdos.

Speaker 2:          00:41:23       They probably just made it legal for witches.

Speaker 4:          00:41:26       All right. We'll allow witchcraft for now. But those drones are the devil. Robot

Speaker 7:          00:41:35       drove my bridging those flying robot, which is out of here on their flying robot. Broomstick. Well there's these two

Speaker 3:          00:41:42       towns in Colorado. One is Greeley and one is a right next to it. I kind of can't remember the name of the one next to it. Deer valley or some shit, whatever it is. The one next to it, it braced we'd like in a big way where they're just got fucking dispensary's opening up everywhere and giant warehouses have right next to it. There's Greeley, Colorado and they had the CNBC show and it was hilarious because they had this guy who was like the sheriff of Greeley who wouldn't allow it and it was like, you know, I'm telling you, there's been a lot of things. I shows you 80 with marijuana now. Like we're noticing long term psychiatric issues, but her habit and you listened to this guy talk and he's like some old fucking cowboy, right? Some crazy old cowboy who doesn't realize the war is over.

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       Yeah. The fucking the guys like standard. Well, you're, no, no, no. Psych, psychiatric issues. What about booze? You Fuck? What about cigarettes and the beatings you took in the boxing gym? Should all that be illegal? You fucking crazy asshole. Look at these people. They're having a blast right next door. Go over to that place. Go, go check out what they're doing. They're fucking dancing. This treat and hugging each other. Everybody's high as fuck. They're making millions. They're making millions and you're like, well, your bum loan. Oh, the psychological issues due to marrow. There's no psychological issues due to fucking playing cards. Okay. People are nuts. We don't, we're not perfect. The idea that weed is the one, what's the fucking sending these psychological issues, people over the top. How dare you? How dare you make that association?

Speaker 7:          00:43:12       Especially since you know, stress is such a huge factor of psychologic shit. The number, it has to be the number one cause of psychological issues. Stress. Not to mention physical people don't really realize the reason why hearts give out is because of stress. That's all the years of stress. I mean, yeah, you get old, but it's still stressed. Stress on the heart and stress stress. So it's so funny that that's a stance like marijuana causing psychological issues when,

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       well the problem Tony Hinchcliffe with your kind of thinking needs, we have data to back up our assertions. It shows a clear change in the human brain we hear is the area that accepts bullshit shrinks. Okay, we need that plump and fat, but that area is not like fog. Why? We need it like, like off filled sponge. That's what we need. That the area that allows bullshit and the marijuana is shrinking this area that allows you to tolerate bullshit and I don't like it. I don't, I do not like it. We need people out there that can do, could just suck in our bullshit and pro. It's like a bullshit liver. That's what it is. You'll give a bullshit liver, liver for booze. You also have a bullshit liver in your brain and marijuana apparently makes it thing shrink. That's what I heard.

Speaker 7:          00:44:22       Wow. They try everything. They've tried it, they try everything. This scare marijuana smokers.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       Why? Why is that? They should just smoke weed and get their dick sucked. They would change the way they feel about all this. They'd be like, I can't believe blowjobs feel so good, dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. It's from someone who loves you. Who tickles your balls when you come in their mouth? Hey, while you're high Jesus Louisa's okay. They don't know about that. Did they know about that? Cause if they do, you know, I would imagine if you're a way the sheriff at Greenlee knows about that. If you're a girl and you smoke a couple of hits a weed and then get your pussy licked, that's kind of feels so good. Could you imagine like a shower feels good when you're high, you can imagine how good it feels for girl. Do you like your ass licked? Do I like my ass? Like, yeah, listen.

Speaker 6:          00:45:07       Hi. How are you never going to have this conversation right now then is here is here with you? I'm not opening those doors. What kind of a man asks another man? This is like a fill out form for a fucking gang bang video. Okay. Now do you like getting your ass luck? Because if yes, checked the box to the right, that should never come up. You should go from you cradle to the grave without anybody ever asking you do you like it in your ass lights,

Speaker 7:          00:45:37       right? Or maybe maybe that should be it. That should be a fun thing about a funeral is you have to write the answer yes or no, like on a piece of paper and then have it in your hand. Like when you're

Speaker 6:          00:45:47       like in the open casket, I secretly love you. Did you check his note? That was the yes, with two exclamation points. He really like the problem with the question.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       Do you like your ass is that's not how anybody ever asks it. If they're going to lick your ass right. They don't go. Do you like to get your ass looked? They don't say that. They would say do you want me to lick your ass? Huh? You do. Huh? They would have a lot of hugs in there. Like you want me to look your ass? Huh? You do? Huh? Like they're already affirming it cause it's a risky thing to say like, you want me to lick your ass? Huh? Let me try it again, Joe. This is an affirmation in it. You know, it's like you, you want to, we want that person to have an easy time saying yes, you want me to look at your ass and you go, well that would be cool.

Speaker 6:          00:46:33       You fucking sick. Fuck fuck you like checked you asshole. Right, right. The bedroom opens up, the camera crew comes in, you've been on the new show, do you want your ass hole? And then it becomes, sounds

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       like a big court case where they try to figure out what the, what ha means when you add hod to it and then the lawyer tries to defend it clearly if she used the word, Huh? She was, she was trying to get a positive affirmation out of him. She was manipulating his emotional responses, the natural responses of a person. He was doing it to be polite. You didn't really want his ass select okay. He didn't want her to feel bad and she said, ha already. It's like, yeah, okay. What as it was happening, he was realizing he had made a mistake. You know, it'd be like joining an army that thinks they're going to go out and fight big foot. Like you got all your fucking gear and you're ready to go to the mountains. Like we are the Sasquatch. And He'd be like, Oh, what have I done? What have I done? I can't believe I'm going to go. This is an army of people I've joined. Fuck, I made a mistake. Shit be can't pull out of it. That's what it's gotta be like. It's crazy. Poor guy, Greeley, Colorado. It put bastard right next door. I forget what the other cities name.

Speaker 7:          00:47:48       Is that the, is that the same place that shoots down the drones? Is there, is it

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       no different place, but the, the other place, the name, they were, those people were so high that I forgot their name. That's how high they were. Like the mayor of the town was joking around about it. They had the mayor of the town and this interview start joking around about this town's always been like that. Like Greeley was at drive town back in the day. He couldn't get booze. We don't want no booze because what we see you and we have tenants in the church. That's a bunch of crazy people. That's what that is. A lot of hooting and hollering.

Speaker 7:          00:48:18       The reason why they're afraid of booze and pot, if they're that afraid of it is because they're afraid. What they'll do with, they have a drink or a smoke. They're afraid that that inner monster, whatever their fears and whatever crazy stuff's going on, that's what that is.

Speaker 3:          00:48:29       Well, no, no, no. Tony Hinchcliffe, I'm worried about your inner monster cause my inner monster is safe under the guidance of the Lord. So you're a heathen out there running around with your own ideas and I got children. Okay, Tony Hawk,

Speaker 7:          00:48:41       I have bad news for you. You're going and praying to an imaginary creature once or twice a week.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       You fucking communists, lesbian asshole. Listen, you can't say that it's imaginary. You don't know you son of a bitch. I go to church, I feel the Holy Spirit inside of me all the time. I moved to tongues. You haven't moved to tongues, Tony Hinchcliffe,

Speaker 7:          00:49:02       then your priest, he drinks wine. I mean Jesus turned water into wine.

Speaker 3:          00:49:05       You don't want to, I'm going to get your athletic, sir. I'm a baptist. Baptist. We don't, we don't fuck around with wine. You can't have wine in the church. That's true. They don't drink wine. I don't believe so. I think the wine is a Catholic thing. Let's find out. It was a Google day. Do Baptist use one? Hmm. I know the Catholics love wine

Speaker 7:          00:49:23       nature. They try any excuse like, Hey, can we get the,

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       well, you know what's really funny? Um, Mormons are not supposed to drink coffee, but they can drink those energy drinks. I'm sorry. I do like, dude, he was a Mormon. Well you sell pound those fucking giant monster energy drinks and the dude would have panic attacks all the time. It was just jack to the teeth all day. Just red lining it all day. This gives me, he has no idea cause never having coffee. Right. He wouldn't drink the coffee, but yet he's pounding. Is it an evil being right? There was an evil being out there and it's corrupt in the souls of red bull gives me wings. Just like the angels have more. Exactly. Exactly. Mormon religion. A drink, a monster energy drink to be a Munster against Satan's urges. Monstrously attack you.

Speaker 7:          00:50:19       Nothing funnier than Mormonism. There is, you know the, when they think that when you die, you get your own planet. You know that, right? Um, how do you know you don't Tony? Hinchcliffe. Okay. Why so judgmental, Tony Hinchcliffe and that everybody lives on their own different planet and then like, well yeah, it'd be dope, but that's a made up story. It's only dope. If we could visit each other. I can wait. Sorry. Like you were on the moon and I was on Mars, but I couldn't get to you. I'd be like, Tony, where are you? But I'm sure in this world, like traveling is like just so fast.

Speaker 3:          00:50:52       Yeah. It's probably pretty quick if you can get to a place where you have your own planet. I assume you just be wherever you want. Whenever you want to be there instantaneous. That'll happen one day. We'll figure that out. We'll be figuring out how to transport ourselves. If human beings live for another million years, if we live, we're supposedly like this close to like this, this frame that we're in right now, the Homosapien, the way we look, it's supposedly pretty similar to what a million years ago. It looked like, like a million years ago. There was some [inaudible] man kind of stood up, but fairly similar, you know, and then maybe in this form, you know, a few hundred thousand years, three or 400,000 years. Like I said, there's a lot of guesswork involved and figured it out. But if we could keep going another million, we would be hairless for sure. We'd lose our hair. We would probably be really slight and very Tony Hinchcliffe like like a dancer's Physique and alien dancer and I heads would grow. We would look like fucking aliens and then hit. We hit that point. If we continue, if we don't blow each other up, if we continue and we don't get hit by an asteroid, we continue to improve our ability to do things. We'll, it'd be nuts. A million years from now, you probably will be able to transport any or teleport

Speaker 7:          00:52:07       anywhere you want anywhere in the world. I want up yet, I'll bet a hundred thousand years at this rate, he's Tony Hinchcliffe at this rate that we're growing with technology. I think we're even closer. I would almost say 10,000 years,

Speaker 3:          00:52:23       thousand years ago, that sounds really dumb, but if 10,000 years ago, it doesn't seem like that long ago, but that's a really long, like 10,000 years ago, we find these like stone buildings that they made a bunch of really cool shit that they left behind, but not much else.

Speaker 7:          00:52:40       Dozen years ago. I don't even think people are on boats. They didn't even figure that out yet. They did

Speaker 3:          00:52:44       there. They're finding out that people figured out a lot of shit a lot earlier than we thought. In fact, 40,000 years ago they were hunting. There were a fishing for tuna and boats, which is pretty cool. Pretty sure that was the number that they came up with cause they found these uh, these deep sea rigs, you know, whether you use these long lines and at these big hooks and they were catching tuna and they found tune in DNA, which is really crazy. Like tuner deep water fish. So these fuckers, let me find out what year it was. They figured out, let me see. What would Google their ancient people fish for tuna. A sitting on a yoga ball. Now know what it is. That chair. It's interesting. It's a fuck back support. Who needs it? No, this is this the best um, back support was for me at least it forces you to stand, sit straight.

Speaker 3:          00:53:30       Like see how I'm sitting. Like this is how you're supposed to set, right. You're supposed to sit like this. Like your head's not supposed to be forward. And when you, most times you sit in the chair, you wind up slumping sitting like that and then it makes your back really tight. Since I've been using this, my back never fucks with me when we do podcasts. That's awesome. Yeah, you just, you, you sit on it and your knees are in it. I don't know what they're called, like a new chair or something like that, but you just, you're, you're carrying your own weight and then once you do it for a while, if you get used to it, then he started doing it everywhere. Like I do it on planes, I do it and you should sit up straight like all the time. And when you don't, when you have bad posture, I used to think that people said, Oh, you should watch your posture because it like, they didn't want you to look in lazy, but it's actually not good for your discs.

Speaker 3:          00:54:14       Like your, your shit gets compressed. That's why I wouldn't do to have a fat wallet. They say never keep a fat wallet in your back pocket if you're one of those guys that keeps every God damn business car that you ever get when we're sad, broken toys r us $10 off you, you get these big fat, crazy thick wallets. If you sit on that shit all the time, you can get disc problems. Like a lot of cab drivers get psychotic nerve problems because they get a pinch disk because your body's just got an uneven distribution of weight and that's what it is. Kind of when you're slumped or sit in weird, you know it's an uneven distribution of weight.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       I have that 100% anytime I go on a road trip now after like two hours, my right side gets starts getting numb and I start, I start having like little, do you sit on your wallet? No I don't, but it's like how I sit and also my max lunch or I'm a turtle.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       Yeah, you shouldn't do that man. I used to think that it was just that like slouching. I, I had a real problem with slouching. I slouch all the time and I just, I think, I thought it was just like the way it looks is not good, but people don't like the way it looks like. So my attitude was, fuck man, let's go. So stupid. But it's just not your, when you, when your back is straight like this, like this is the way you're not, you're supposed to stand your, your spinal column, your core is carrying your weight very evenly. It's all stacked up. But when you're head goes forward and you sort of relax, you put a great deal of pressure on other parts. You put like, uh, there's like a peak area of your spine that has additional pressure, it seems like nothing and it is nothing for a long time and then it becomes something. And if you sit like I used to get real bad back and neck pains from writing and I think I might've fucked myself up doing that as much as I fucked myself up from doing Jujitsu. Cause I would write for a long period of time and I would sit in a chair like this when my head forward and then when I was all done I'd be like, ah, my neck would be fucking killing me.

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       I just don't like sitting like this cause I feel like I'm like posing like a woman and I'm sure he correctly pointed my button boobs. I feel like I have to like look back at it like I hate it or something. So you're afraid of what the way it looks. You'd rather just have a backache. Right. You know, a backache. It's just easier to deal with. But seriously, it does look really silly for me to sit like, hey, cause I mean my butt's sticking out, my sticking out. Like I feel like, uh, well you

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       need to reduce both of them. That would help tremendously. And that's Brian Redbill. Right? Totally. I don't want to lose my, my boobs and my butt. Uh, you know, I've been working on this. So he lost a lot of weight and got real slim. It's like, it makes my head look too big. Fuck. And he's just kind of like a free spin. All this work to get down to like 160 something pounds. He was like super skinny. Yeah. I have a picture of me and you together and I looked like a fucking lego boy. She don't look like a Lego boy, dude. You just, you look healthy. I look like at an aids. Remember everyone called me aids so quick. You did. It's not everyone. You're at the post office and drop off some packages. Okay. AIDS face. Alright, you aids face. Yeah. Starbucks. Venti Mocha Latte. AIDS face. Okay. They write it on your cup.

Speaker 3:          00:57:29       It didn't look like he had aids. Dude, what it looked like to me was a guy who lost weight. He looked healthy. That's when we met Seth Rogen. That's right. Yeah. We did the high times music awards. What is it? High Times awards. I presented him with stoner of the year and there was Jack [inaudible], Jack hair or hair or when he was alive back then. Those things are interesting. Those fucking high times awards. She meet all of the fellow stoners, not maybe the nicest people on the planet, like celebrity stoners, like be real. Is there a nicer person and be real that guys, one of the nicest people on the planet and all those celebrities, stoners and all like super cool. Doug Benson, sweetheart, you know? Yeah, I'll just, all the celebrities, stoners are just super nice people. Why anybody would want to stop a drug like that?

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       Well, you know, I'll tell you the problem with that. Well, you're not taking into account as a lack of ambition. You stoners, they did take up, you know, a lot of room and they don't do anything. They don't, they don't earn their keep it. Sheriff. What about all the artists and the musicians that have come from my pot smoke pot? You mean queers like Steve Jobs? Is that you're just trying to say? Yeah, Jesus took him from us. Let me tell you something. Jesus not impressed. He didn't do you know what? It looked like? AIDS face there. You look good and it looked like no, you're just not used to it cause you're used to this backup. You saw the support, you got your head and then he got some backup. When you're potty shrinks up, you felt like you didn't have any backup. Your head just didn't.

Speaker 5:          00:58:54       Aw, Brian. Dude, you don't look bad there at all. You look great. You want to have sex. You know I've told you before. Why does everything that skinny with you mean gay? That's so weird. This has got issues. I just looked like I had aids. You don't look like you have aids. HIV. You don't even look again for each of it. You'll get diarrhea like a little bit like you got to that phase,

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       dude. Come on, look at that picture. You don't look at all, it's the dude from weeds. But look at your face. You do not look bad at all. I couldn't, I can't watch weeds. I watched one episode and um, uh, who the fuck was on it? One of our, our friends was on.

Speaker 7:          00:59:32       Oh, uh, who was on it? Kevin Nealon. Bright Ernst Brennan or answers all. Yes. Right. What did he play like a drug dealer drug dealer. And I watched it

Speaker 3:          00:59:42       is Bret was on it. That's it. I watched it one of the time when I was like, this is fake. This is not real. Not buying them.

Speaker 7:          00:59:49       No, it's fake is that catfish show. I heard so many people to say how awesome that show is. I finally watch it. The fake his show I've ever seen. I didn't know it was fake. You know? I heard on reality TV sometimes they like playing that shit out, like it's not really reality. Did you hear that Tony? Well, it almost seems like it would benefit them with so much money. Spending money on, wait a minute. Conspiracy Theorists, the would, they would do two just to make money, willing to fake it and risk their reputations on. That's a reality show. When I tune into a reality show, I want reality. You know that and I know that. That's a weird one to fake though. You know, that is just fucking pizza. Best one to fit all that. They couldn't really figure out how easy it is, like what they're doing. Like people just looking at a camera like I thought for sure that he was, you know, the man that I thought

Speaker 3:          01:00:42       did, people will do whatever the fuck you asked them to do. If you have a camera in front of you, I mean there's a certain amount of people that will do it. So if you have some sort of reality show and you just manipulate these people and say, Hey, I want you to, this is what you're going to do. Are you going to tell us they know that you been texting this guy and pretending to be a girl and then you're gonna meet him here and say, I busted you do. Now I know what's up. And the guy's like, okay, okay. Okay. How long have I known him? You've been friends for 20 years. Okay, okay, okay. We've been friends for 20 years, men and they'll say shit like that, man. We'd been friends for 20 years. I thought I trusted you.

Speaker 7:          01:01:15       Of course they going to fit all that Maury Povich and stuff like that. That shows still when I'm on the road and I'm flipping through channels, I'll stop for a few minutes and I'll watch Maury, I'll, I'll watch the results because no matter what, no matter what happens, one of them is going to get up and go, oh, I told you, I told you that that was or wasn't my baby. Like whichever one, one of them's going to flip out because they, you know, it's just so coached.

Speaker 3:          01:01:40       She was a doorman at, um, uh, not east side comedy club, governors, governors in Levittown in Long Island. And one of the doorman was a regular on those shows back in the day. Like, this is the 19, I want to say 1990, 1991 pre internet. And he used to get a call and they would say, we're looking for a man who has been having sex with his brother's wife. And he goes, what a coincidence. I've been having sex, my brother's wife, what do you want me to do? And they would, they would you, they would literally say that to him, see if you can help us out here. That was the conversation that would have, what we're trying to find is a guy who got arrested wearing women's clothes, trying to get a job in a woman's office and they go, oh, what a coincidence. That, you know, they'll tell him the exact scenario that he wants.

Speaker 3:          01:02:25       So all those people are just, they're just good at it. You'll see the Mike Rekha did it. Mike Rekha did it way back in the day. Mike Ricco, who was a comic at the comedy store in the 1990s he did that Shit for money. I met Mike. Yeah. Mike is Funny Dude, man. Mike was a funny dude. You know, I don't know if he's still doing stand up anymore, but back in the day when we, we started out together at the store in the 90s he was fucking funny man. There's a lot of those guys that for whatever reason, you know, people don't find out about them.

Speaker 8:          01:02:52       Yeah. He's one of those guys that was there the first a few months when I started and we like made friends and then I watched him basically quit. Yeah. I mean, I, he, I know, I think he moved somewhere else, but I, you know, I watched him fade out of the store.

Speaker 3:          01:03:06       Yeah. But anyway, he used to do that shit. They would hire him to do, like I remember when, um, what was the chick Jenny Jones was that it that check whether the show remember and they, they did a thing where they humiliated this guy because there was a gay guy that he worked with that was a in love with him. And so he, the guy comes on and uh, he has no idea that this gay guy loves them and he freaks out. He gets humiliated on the show and then he goes and shoots the guy afterwards and they were like, that's a wrap for you. And they just cease and desist the entire show. But that show was a, that was a turning point. And those things, they realize, okay, this isn't fucking repercussions to the shit like you guys are. But in that,

Speaker 8:          01:03:47       that's when stuff started getting more produced. Like they realize that exist. They got to tell the person before,

Speaker 3:          01:03:54       right? Yeah. When they did the Jenny Jones thing, that was a real guy and a real office who was attracted to his coworker. And when that guy was on TV with them, this nutty dude, he wound up shooting the guy. You know, he was just humiliated beyond words. But where's like if you were on there and you found out some guy at work thought you were hot, you'd be uncomfortable, but he would, he would find it hilarious. Right. And you would, you'd probably have an issue cause dudes can get creepy. And you know, if you were a girl, you got on a show and you found out that your coworker loves you, there'll be a real problem. You know, if you a girl, say if you worked in some office, maybe even have a boyfriend or a husband and you got some guy who's your coworker who not only professors his love to you, but does so on national television in a surprise attack. Yeah. You'd be like, oh great, now I got to fucking stop working there or he's going to stop working there or something's gonna happen.

Speaker 8:          01:04:43       Yeah. It is a weird approach, especially when you factor in that. That guy probably told the gay guy, probably told the guy on Jenny Jones on the air so that nothing would happen to him. You know? He didn't tell him at the office like, hey man, I really like you. Please don't hit me. He went on the air and that backfired.

Speaker 3:          01:05:00       Yeah. I guess he probably thought, look, I'm going to be on TV with the fucking is going to happen to me. All right. I'm going to be on television. Nothing can happen. It's not going to hurt me. No one's going to hurt me. Jen on television. Yeah. Jenny Jones. Careers just going to keep going on. The show's going to keep going. Everything's going to be fine. Jim Jones is a talent. Yeah. Okay. You're not going to stop her with

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       one little scandal. Right. It's going to be back stronger than ever. America demands change. John's. Yeah. She used to have a show that she would do. She was a comic. Oh Wow. I didn't know she used to have, yeah, she used to do a show back in the day. If you go to Jenny Jones, like the early stuff, it's crazy cause she had this crazy but bulletproof hairdo, these big giant like huge sprayed up hairdo and she would do these ladies only shows. And when I was living in Boston, there was a club, uh, I don't know if it was the Kami connection or it was, it was either duck soup or the improv because it was the upscale there. They had an upscale club and she would a buy out every seat and there was no men who are allowed in the building. The, the guys couldn't work. The bar guys couldn't work the door. They had to have like all female employees, females in the whole thing would be filled with females. And so they did it as sort of like a gimmick. And they had these all female shows with Jenny Jones and talk about her period.

Speaker 5:          01:06:10       Wow. Or whatever

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       men stuff were things that men want to hear. That's, but that's a, the when the guy fucked with her or that's when the, um, the guy I fucked with the other guy rather, and uh, told them that he was in love with them. But if you go back to her stand up, you'll see her crazy hair. When, when they had her on the talk show, she kind of toned it down and her hair became like normal sized. Yeah. But before it was like some tribal thing she had before she was on TVs. Yeah. She has like some trouble peacock thing going on. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:06:43       There's network head. Say, oh, we're going to put you in hair and makeup. No, no. Stan is that stand up. Yeah. She supposedly on this Ferris guys, look at that POW man. Good Lord. It's like David Bowie. That's like rock stars here. Some of it. He's a good eye doctor though.

Speaker 10:         01:07:04       And she's hot. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:07:07       Mr. Jokes around the country. I feel like kind of a spokesperson for women. I think men should listen to me. I think you guys can learn something really. You wanna know what I find attractive on a man? Cash.

Speaker 10:         01:07:17       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:07:18       I hate you. Wear the tight wise. Where are you? She looks like the top half of a sentence and see what clothes looked like in the 60. [inaudible] the way she's moving cause she's on those heels. It's just a balancing at dinner at the sizzler. He forgot the coupons. We had to go back.

Speaker 10:         01:07:35       Oh my God. This is, they've got an applause break.

Speaker 5:          01:07:38       Stop this. Stop this right now. This is CGI. CGI The king car. That's better. Sees you as a dire wolves and game of Thrones. That's ridiculous. There's nothing worse than a fake applause. Break like a bad one. Well, I mean the navy really loved her and we're so happy to hear it. Just get out of joke. Oh you saw the movie punchline right? With oh I tried to watch it the other day and just see if there was like, there was parts in it that I remember going. That was the, that was hilarious, but in the wrong reason. Yeah. Yeah. Well that was before you did stand up. Right. And that was also like 10 when it came out. Yeah, I

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       was, um, I was doing standup when that came out. Like I was just starting to do stand up and I remember watching going, what the fuck is this? This is crazy. Like it's, it's weird when you watch someone do something that you know they can't do. Like if I was ever gonna like say if I did a movie, I'll never do a movie that you'll have to play guitar. But if I did a movie where I played guitar in it, I would learn how to fucking play guitar. Okay. Cause if I was a guitar player and I was watching some movie about Jimmy Hendrickson, the guy's just like, all right,

Speaker 5:          01:08:44       no, he doesn't know what he's doing. He's just moving his fingers around. Yeah, I would, I would be like this is annoying

Speaker 3:          01:08:48       shit. I know he can't really play guitar. This guy is faking it. Like if you watch him like some fake Kung Fu in a movie, it's very good.

Speaker 5:          01:08:53       It ruins the movie for you. Right. That's why like in kill bill ever see that? Oh, you're a Tino sent everybody in that assassination squad to Japan for like a month or two or three. Some crazy amount of time. Learn. Kendo, learn all of it. They learn the art of the Samurai Sword. They learned a Kung Fu. I mean big time like from the guys for what? Main people from the actual old school stuff. Well, you know David Lee Roth does that now. David Lee Roth lives in Japan and Take Samurai lessons. That sounds awesome. That sounds amazing to Japan with his dog

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       by himself. Got An apartment and he takes Kendo. Kendo is this Japanese sword fighting and he practices sword fighting. That's so cool. Yeah. David Lee Roth is a legit maniac. He said, well, he's wild man. You know, doesn't give a fuck. Having a great time doing Kendo. Playing sword fighting. One of the biggest rock stars the world's ever known.

Speaker 5:          01:09:47       And you knew those Japanese people lose it. If he comes into like their restaurant, it's a bit of a jump jump. Go ahead and jump. I bet not.

Speaker 3:          01:10:00       I bet he sleeps links right in. You know, because he dresses very low key. Like he wears overalls all the time and like one of them paper Boi hats. He wears one of those things all the time. So He's, I bet he just slinks around. It's gotta be so beautiful over there and Japanese, Japanese culture. So smooth and relaxing and cool. It's very different. That's for sure. That's one of the reasons why Japan, if you go over there, it feels like you're in another world. It doesn't just feel like you're in another country. It feels like you're in another world. Like the way people behave, like everybody's like really polite. It's, it's very unusual. They don't necessarily like white people, especially the old folks that were around like during the Pearl Harbor days. You know, not, not a big fan of white folks when it comes to that, but the rest of them, the young kids love Americans, young people. I guess most of those Pearl Harbor people were dead. But how could you expect it to not hate on Americans? They dropped two bombs on them where the, yeah, we

Speaker 5:          01:10:56       messed up. We, yeah, we did that. That was sort of an ouchie. That was a big ouch. That's a such a dick move. Billy is, I mean we are the only people in the world to really nuke another place. Right. We'd go to twice to do it once. Sure. They weren't just shitty buildings. Let's try

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       the other one. Yeah, no, I think it was the next day or something like that.

Speaker 7:          01:11:17       Oh, oh, it was, you know, there's one guy, because I read a thing. Here's one that's crazy for me. I read a thing about the guy that was in both, he was in Hiroshima, right. And uh, he had to like go to work. Like he barely survived or whatever was on a train or something like that to Nagasaki. So he goes from here, she survives Hiroshima and Nagasaki the next day. And then same thing happens. Imagine the luck on that guy. God, that's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       That's crazy. And just imagine that time of the year or that time of the world when you really could just think that this could continue. Like bombs could just be dropping now. Like once we started, we were in the middle of a world war and then all sudden cities are getting a level, like a whole city is getting leveled. Hmm. I mean how many people died? Those

Speaker 7:          01:12:05       a lot. And you know, another thing is that the one in Hiroshima landed next to a hill. So like the hill actually saved a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          01:12:13       The, okay. The atomic bomb killed between 90 and 166,000 within the first two to four months, roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day during the following month's large numbers died from the effects of the burns, radiation, sickness and other injuries compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable garrison. Wow. Crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:12:44       Oh, we got a shooter of the day shooting at Oregon high school to confirmed dead. Oh, that's today. Yeah. Just now. Jesus Christ. Oh. Or what the hell is going on? Do you think it's getting going to become where we all have to have guns. We all have to carry guns. Just like star wars where we all have our weapons all the time. All of us are going to be one or the other. Either it's going to be that or it's going to be no guns. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       August 6th was Hiroshima. August 9th was Nagasaki. So they waited. They waited a couple of days. God, it's so scary. Yeah, yeah. Bold. That's what the gun people are worried about the gun people worried about. You know, they're just going to try and take our guns away now and people are not going to just give up their guns and they're going to vote for people that are going to be putting an offense. They're getting sure that you don't put up their guns. And then the problem is those people also get connected. Like if you, if you have a guy like say there's a guy that says I am going to support the second amendment, no matter what. Every American has a right to bear arms. Everybody goes crazy. All the bear arms, people are on that guy side now. So that guy, you can attach that guy to a bunch of other shit you might not necessarily believe in.

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       Like you get attached to that guy to a bunch of weird environmental shit relaxing some of the environmental regulations that are on certain areas that are a bit risky to do certain things in that might kill a bunch of fucking weird fish. But whatever, whatever, we can make a lot of money. There's those guys get attached and corrupted in a attached to all those things because you know that there's a sizeable chunk of Americans that will vote to keep their guns. And then there's also the people that are on the other side of it that you know, they'd look, they'd, no matter what, they're going to vote against guns. There's no matter what. Like if you, if you're, we got to clean up these streets and take these guns out of these schools, you hush. There's those people and you've got those people. If you are an anti gun person, you say, we need tighter regulations, we need tighter restrictions.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       We need less guns, not more gone. You have those people. So, and then you can attach that to a bunch of weird shit. It'd be weird social shit insurance company scams where everybody has to get certain amounts of insurance and it kept, can we swap my Omar, how about we have a, everybody has to wear your seatbelt because we were paying out too much money. So they have regulations to protect you. You have to wear a seatbelt. Well if I have to wear a seatbelt, how come this guy is allowed to drive a motorcycle? Are you crazy? He doesn't even have a cage around him. Like this doesn't make any sense. Okay. You make them wear help. Congratulations. Make them wear helmets. I think it's way safer for me in a car with no seatbelt on. And I'm not trying to argue for no seat belts cause I always wear one.

Speaker 3:          01:15:22       But I think it's way it probably way safer to be in a car with no seatbelt than it is to be on a motorcycle when there's an accident. Right. And in a lot of states they don't even have to wear a helmet. No, no, Colorado, you don't, you don't have to in Vegas either Ohio and that's a big one. Yeah, I think, uh, there's a few, there's quite a few. I think it's because the people that ride motorcycles, they love that feeling so much that they're like, fuck it. I'm willing to risk my dead. Imagine that is like the wearing a condom of the motorcycle world. It's like once you do it without one, you're like fuck or that and that. You're absolutely right. But nowadays with such great technology with Bluetooth and phones and stereos and the helmets and stuff, I think more people are actually wearing helmets because it's bad ass to take a phone call while you, it's in your helmet.

Speaker 3:          01:16:07       Yeah. I don't know about that dude because the type of dudes who um, don't want to wear helmets, those are like the Harley guys, you know, whether they don't want, they just want their Bandanna floating in it and a woman and a woman when her arms wrapped around my waist, I'm free. I got my red, white and blue. They interrupt her. Him. Oh wait, is that a drone up in the air? How much true maverick? I'm not like those faggots out there pretending. Okay. I'm a true maverick. I vote Republican and I ride a motorcycle. I'm a woman's, got some long nails like scratch my back and I feel them pulling on the leather. My Mum, my vest and my motorcycle club makes them, we'll up inside thinking about all my other brothers, my brothers are out there on their metal horses riding out into the sunset where together we're a team. We're a band of brothers. I ride my back and I bear arms and I got the arms of a bear. Did you ever read a Hunter Thompson's a thing on um, the motorcycle gangs?

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       He wrote his first book, the big book that sort of introduced a hundred Thompson to the world was his take on the hell's angels. He was embedded in the hell's angels, like hung around with them, went with them and he did it for a long time. He was with like for a couple of years, he was like embedded in the hell's angels can go hang out with him at parties and shit. But then, um, he got into an altercation because the guy was beating up his girlfriend and hunter said something to him and the guy beat the shit out of him too. And a couple other guys beat the shit out of them too. And then he wrote the book, the book came out and everybody fucking, you know, went crazy for it. And that sort of the started a hunters Thompson's Gonzo journalism, he went from that, which is more of, it's different if you compare it to his other stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:17:50       That's his first piece, which is more, it's still got that sort of Gonzo edge to it, but it's more based in reality. Then like when he did fear and loathing in Las Vegas, when he got the fear and loathing in Las Vegas, that was originally supposed to be something that he wrote for ESPN and it was a covering like a motorcycle race. And it was so fucking crazy that, you know, they were like, we can't use this. And a, he turned it into like this novel and that sort of kick started his Gonzo career that in Kentucky, the Kentucky Derby, he wrote a piece on the Kentucky Derby that was pretty fucking crazy too. But he, um, he was embedded with those fucking angels for two years and he's got some wild fucking stories, man orgies. And those guys would live, would be like kiss each other whenever they would have cameras on them. They would kiss each other and telling each other wow, freak people out. Since these big motorcycle dudes, crazy beards making out with each other, wow. Wasn't

Speaker 11:         01:18:45       why am ca, where'd they get actually gay? Because I saw a video the other day and it didn't seem very gay village, the village people and it's, but it seemed like maybe one or two of them were, but they, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:18:56       do you remember, do you remember Jamie Kennedy when Jamie Kennedy had a, that show the Jamie Kennedy experiment or what was it?

Speaker 11:         01:19:04       Jamie [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       Was it the experiment? Yeah, he um, he had this one episode that he did and it was about guys and talk to these guys into being strippers. They're going to be male strippers and then along why to get creepier and creepier. Are they going to be on a TV show? They're going to be there. You're going to be able to like girls gone wild guys gone nuts. Okay, this guy's got nuts. Hey, yeah. Okay, okay. And then they tell them that it's going to be, a lot of it is for gay guys, but it doesn't matter man. You gotta be a huge star and all that stuff. And you know, he starts like going over like some of the gay things he might have to do like, like money don't have to make out with another man, might have to. All the guys were like, well man, I don't want to do that but I do want to be on the show. Damn. Um, and then at the end of it they reveal. But it's real. It's not a setup. It was a real show. I mean Jamie Kennedy's fucking genius in that Shit. I don't know why he stopped doing that. I mean maybe it was like lawsuits. Maybe they got in trouble for doing it, but that was like the best shit he ever did. It was really fucking funny. But it was all these guys. So I would suspect that it's like that kind of situation that if you, there's this, there's enough

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       guys out there that if you just guaranteed them, they're going to be on television, guaranteed them to got to have some sort of fame. They'll do some gay shit.

Speaker 11:         01:20:15       Well, the reason why I ask, cause I that something that David or Eddie van Halen Shit. David Lee Roth did I am a Gigolo everywhere. I didn't know that. Why am or a village people was one of their songs and if you watch the video it's smooth as hell. Like, like, like he's a pimp and then, and that was like, wait a second, I thought this was like, like some weird like a gay band, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:20:38       do is type in, are the village people and then yeah,

Speaker 12:         01:20:41       Google filled out.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       Okay. Which members of the village people were our gay. All right, here we go. Uh, Victor Willis, the policemen and Glenn Hughes. The biker were straight while pepe rose or Philippe rose, the American Indian and Randy Jones, the cowboy. David Hodo, the construction worker and Alex Briley military man were gay. So there was only two straight dudes and the rest of them were just for gay members jerking off on them while they're taking nuts. What is this? That's it. This is just the Gigolo,

Speaker 12:         01:21:18       this guy. This is a village people. Wow. David Lee Roth. You have a lot of explaining the, but it's actually like a kind of cool video and I like, it's got like this, I just changed my idea of what the village people where you can really tell which ones are gay. Like this guy's just hooking up with a chick and then it cuts to some guy with a black tank top. And the pilots had, well not only that, it's a black guy and a white woman. Yeah, the interracial vibe to it. And she's really hot too.

Speaker 12:         01:21:56       Wow. Oh there they were again. They were all in the alley. They cut to the gay guys dancing, looking at themselves in the mirror. No, the policeman was not gay. The policemen and the biker or straight. So that guy with the crazy mustache. That's the biker, right? He's straight, believe it or not. Wow. How's that possible hanging out with too many gay guys hanging on? I ain't got no, that's hilarious that the Indian is gay as fuck though. See, I'm looking at him dance. Look at that cowboy. You can't tell me that cowboy straight. I'll tell you that right now. This is what, you can't even dance like that until you've had three or four dicks in your ass. It's not possible to move that away. There's a looseness in his hips. This is crazy. As the biker straight is, fuck yeah. The bikers like, I am so proud. They're going to pounce on me. I'm just going to be so gay that they don't even want a part of me.

Speaker 3:          01:23:04       That's what he's doing. It's like, man, Halan.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Yeah, that mustache, that guy with the mustache to assume you would have to be.

Speaker 12:         01:23:10       Oh, totally. Nope. That's, wait. No, he's straight now. He was in the closet. Hey, you're still in denial like I know what you're talking about, man. I mean, I just fucking, just a job, bro. I'm just playing a biker. Even if he's not gay. His mustaches, that mustache jumps off his face in the middle of the night and goes and bangs dudes just comes back in the morning smelling like liquor in, but oh, holes in Bacardi village. People are great. I can get, Bro. Can you imagine how insulted the Indians, the Indians representatives are quite pathetic now to Cherokee nation voices is just

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       approval. Oh, that was an Apache. Don't worry about it bro. Those are the enemy anyway. You know the Indians like they didn't all like each other. Did you guys know that? Oh yeah. Fuck all the time. All the time. The idea that like the white man came and like there's a peaceful land. They came the white man and killed everyone I think. And you guys were kind of killing each other to the Lakota Sioux, the Sioux Indian that the term sue doesn't mean that's their name. Like that means enemy. That's what it means. They're, they call themselves the Lakota people, but the word sue is entity to the, so these other native tribes called them enemy. Obviously the Americans and the Americans, the white people. Europeans did a way better job of killing people and we're way more fucked up about it and we're way more evil about it and had guns and a lot of this shit, but they didn't like each other either.

Speaker 1:          01:24:53       That's just people, man. You never going to find like this idea of you find this one piece for utopia where everyone got along. They were one with nature and they did a lot of raping and killing to fucking cut people up. They did a lot of evil shit. They eight people, so stop everybody. There's no like one race that you can go back and go. Those fuckers had it nailed right. Those guys were super cool to each other. They had a balance civilization. There was no murder, no rape, no theft was never existed. Definitely not. We're a work in progress, ladies and gentlemen and shit takes time. The universe has been here for something billion years. How many billions? 14 billion, something like that. This planet's been here four and a half billion. 4.6 something like that. I'm not sure how long ass time. Okay. We've been here for a million years. If that. It takes time. We've got to figure it out. So no cultures ever had it. Right. The idea that we should have left the American Indians alone. Yeah. Great idea. Fucking terrific. And then what, and then what exactly.

Speaker 12:         01:25:52       They're there. All the village people, it's just a bunch of Indians come on. We needed to get some America seconds

Speaker 1:          01:25:57       in there. Yeah. Not only that, like I'm not, um, I'm not, I'm like arguing for genocide. But that's happens when people go in, they look at history, they look at the positive benefits of like, things that have happened that were really ugly. Like when, uh, like people talk about the Mongols, they talk about how the Mongols, uh, they, they, they improve trade routes they killed millions of people do though. I mean they improve trade routes by butchering like entire cities of people. Yeah. They, things definitely started moving more freely. But, but people like, like to like look at the positive benefits of like, things like that were horrible. Genocide took place. So if you looked at like Americans establishing American Europeans coming over and established American killing all these native Americans, some people, if they looked at it that way, would say, well, if it wasn't for that, we would never have Atlanta. We would never have Miami. We would never have these wonderful cities that we eat enjoy today. So in the long run it worked out. Yeah. And the Indians, they have their casinos. That's true. They make a lot of money.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       It's a pretty fucked up history when you think about the history of the United States. Only a few hundred years ago, there's these other folks that lived here like only a few hundred years ago and as many as like a million. There was a lot of them at one point in time there was a lot of fucking people living in this country. Like the idea that this place wasn't, wasn't populated. Right. A lot of them, they killed a lot of fucking people. Yeah. They killed him in the crepe. Creepiest ways to like putting, they put smallpox in their, their uh, their, their, their blankets. Was it smallpox? So they put in their blankets and gave to these people. They put like blankets. They had scabs in the blankets of people that have diseases and they would put it in the blankets and give them to the American Indians. Oof. Oof. Spreading these evil terminal diseases.

Speaker 7:          01:27:40       Josh Martins bed, our friend I had just moved into a place and he like, it's first night there. Yeah, you got screwed over by these two guys that had a bedroom for rent and he gave him the deposit and the first month's rent and slept there for one night and everything he owned since he moved it all into his new bedroom got infested by bedbugs. Oh No. Yeah. And they're like really hard to get rid of. You need to wash seal, you need to seal everything and wash it all at 110 degrees for an hour at least. And you have to do all this stuff with everything. His mattress is now garbage and he's like a very struggling young comics. Oh No. So they knew about it before they ran it in the place. Yeah. So he's going to try to, oh, this is, this is somebody that just came off of living his in his car for a whole year.

Speaker 7:          01:28:30       Yeah. In the last two months. He was living in his car after it had been peed on by another comic. Right. Oh yeah. This is for guys just not getting any luck. Yeah. Fuck man. Bedbugs are supposedly like all throughout New York City. It's a real issue with bedbugs. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I it, because this happened to him, uh, over the weekend. I ended up reading about it yesterday and it's really crazy. They were almost extinct completely. And then in [inaudible] 95 or something like that, for no apparent reason, there was an explosion of bedbugs. I remember it just being, I, I used to think

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       they weren't even real. I used to think it was just a thing that my mom said to me before bed, like, have a good night. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Like that whole thing. No, they're real. Dude. When I was in high school, my dog had fleas and she, uh, she got the fleas in my carpet and I couldn't get him out. Man. I could not get them out. Like when I would go from my, my bedroom, like from my carpet to my bed, I would give bugs on me and don't have to take them off that I had that happened once. That was the scariest one of the worst times of my life. It drove me crazy. Feel like they're on you all the time and I was a fucking lazy kid too. I wasn't going to clean my room. I wasn't gonna vacuum was, I just wasn't going to get it done.

Speaker 4:          01:29:36       They jumped right on your ankles barring remember that have a little scabs on my ankles so I eventually had to pull everything out of my room and then foam it down. We had to get this machine, you know those machines and they hire people to come by and you know you could rent them and like home depot and shit or whatever it was. I thought one of us. Did you buy one if you ever need it? Well I think carpets or gross man, I would rather have a wood floor that you can clean up real easy. You can't really clean carpets that good. It's like clothes that you never change. I couldn't agree with you more. I hate carpet. If it was up to me it would just be, if you have hardwood, maybe like a little rug and then with something when something spills on the rug, get a new rug.

Speaker 4:          01:30:14       Yeah. Roll that bitch up fire. Absolutely. Yeah. I think that's like a thing that people thought was like a luxury in the 80s, the 70s or whatever the fuck it was. Carpet and they realize ah, this is like a sweater that people walk on, right? It's like a giant towel is, it's essentially just like a towel, towels of those little things that stick out of them. Who you mean plush? Yeah, the fancier it is, the more it entraps uh, bacteria and everything. You know what I don't like? I don't like towels that are synthetic because you could feel it when they're wet. When you're wet and you rub like one of those plush synthetic towels and it almost like doesn't absorb the water, wipes the water on you a little bit, like absorbed some of it, but you could feel the difference. Or if you get like a real legit cotton towel, you feel it like dry you off.

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       You feel it, like take the water off. Those slippery ones make me feel like I'm ruining the environment. Oh yeah. I throw those out. Those are my, I couldn't probably, this print thing will probably melt when you light on fire would melt. You know, I saw you at e three. You're or I heard your voice on the e three when you, they announced the new UFC and they uh, I've played some of it and they did, I guess Bruce Lee is now in it. So you can fight Bruce leave versus like GSP. Dude. Have you seen it? Yeah, the graphics are insane. They're insane. It's amazing. There are so close now they're getting so close to like making it look like a real movie. Like making it a real fight in HD. And your own commentary on that. Yeah. Did I did ours. I was just going to ask like, oh are you have to say like everything cause you have to get every possible thing out. Yeah. I mean I'm not complaining but I am kind of, but it wasn't, wasn't like a difficult thing to do. It just takes a long time. Right. It's actually fun. I would just pretend that was watching fights and you I would

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       just do it. Exactly. I would, when I was doing it, I would just think about moments that things happen, like moments like guys landed kicks or you know punches or take downs or someone catching the choke and I would just remember like historic fight moments and they're just sort of try to recapture that and try to pretend that that's happening while I was screaming at him. So if you watch, if you play the video, it's very close to the way I would do commentary to real fire.

Speaker 12:         01:32:27       I love, actually Chris isn't the best. No one has ever been better than the buffaloes total look up. Good to fucking graphics. That's incredible. My God, I didn't realize this was the game until you just said that. That's crazy. Who gets the fucking shadows and Dwayne is, it's so much better than it used to be. Exactly like Rhonda Rousey. That's crazy. And look at the movement. The movements really good. Now you heard the ground game controls are a lot easier now to get into Jujitsu news and stuff. This is crazy shit. It looks so good. That's a good team. I mean it looks real. Rarely been spending a lot, but I'll tell you what, people take a lot more head kicks in this game than they do and feel things. A couple of those jammies in real life to shut the lights out. This is wild. Is it? Is it weird to see all your friends digitizing the Bruce Lee thing is amazing if, if you bring a Bruce Lee, is he wearing the yellow and black? You said that about right

Speaker 1:          01:33:48       gay as possible. You can. You can talk like that when it's about Bruce Lee. You're allowed to. Isn't that funny? Like ripped. Ripped is a thing that people want. They want ripped cod. They want to see the six pack. Meanwhile, the best fighter possibly ever was fate or million inco and he was fat as fuck. He walked around with like a belly. You know, he had like a little role, like helix jiggles around the middle a little bit. It didn't give a fuck. Just gone there and fuck guys up. Anderson Silva was never that repped either. You know, he was more smooth. It means to obviously muscular and very strong, but he wasn't like Bruce Lee and shredded like it was a few guys that are like that fucking shredded greasy like Batman. Bruce Lee was like legitimately one of the first guys to figure out that there were certain aspects of all the martial arts that were effective and the best way to do it was to combine them all before Bruce Lee. Nobody combined shit. That was like a thing that you would have pride in. You know, I have studied, showed up, Khan, I will continue to be a show con man to the day I die. I am a wing Chung man, you know, I, you know and people would like represent their style like an old Fu movie,

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       you know, where they thought that there was only one style that was the correct style. My master learned from the Great Masters and he came down from Korea and taught me this style. Bruce Lee was like, that's nonsense. Bruce Lee was the guy who invented MMA. Really? What'd you do? You fart covering your own mouth. I know it was building my brand and my shirts. You can't even go an hour without getting you back on the vape pen to, yeah. Did you get off the cigarettes? I still smoke cigarettes. They age. What happened man? What was the stressful event that caused you to go back off work stuff? I didn't get something that I was working for a couple months for really, really hard and I mean, I'm going to get back to, listen Tony. I've got to get off in the long run. It did you good? Trust me. Yeah, you're, you're, you shouldn't be on shows, Dude.

Speaker 4:          01:35:46       You should just get funny just from your stand up. I mean get famous just from your stand up. Funny. Just from your stand up. Get famous just from your stand up. And the reason why I say this is because no one is ever going to be able to capture what you do best any place other than onstage. And you know when you're on stage that's you. You're, you're 100% in control of the content, the way it's set up delivered and it's hilarious. Like you can't do that if you're doing a TV show, you're going to do with a bunch of people. They're going to have some fucking wacky ideas about what Tony h should wear and Tony, we got like just a little bit of makeup, just a slight base like okay, okay and next thing you know. Yeah, it was it, it was a little bit bigger than that, that the draining thing like it was, it was something that like, I know, I know what it was funny.

Speaker 4:          01:36:30       Yeah, I know what it was. He worked on it for a long time. It was really tough loss. If you're going to do a show, I really think it should be your own show just to figure out how to do your own thing. You're doing somebody else's thing. I think that's for a comic, that's one of the hardest things to, to realize. It takes a long time to realize, but you're better off doing your own thing. Then you are like, if you get stuck on some show, like when I was on fear factor, it was a great benefit. Financially it was really good, but we doing someone else's thing, it's not, it's like a job. It becomes something that you think about like, okay, now I'm going to work. Not a complaining. It was great job, but there's a huge difference between that and like doing a podcast or that and doing, doing stand up, especially doing stand up.

Speaker 4:          01:37:09       Oh yeah. That's the freest one. You're completely in control of how you do it completely in control of what you're right. You experiment, you come up with your own stuff and you're not wasting any time doing anybody else's thing and that then exactly. I mean I wasn't going to slow down on my stand up or you know the me thing, but I really wanted that. I really wanted something that's, I mean that's a good thing that you never stopped with your stand up. Some guys do, right? They start, they get a job writing and they stopped performing. It's crazy. That was a, that was one of the things when I got into the writer's room for the first time, I was amazed at how funny a lot of the guys were and that they used to do standup and that once they started the writing job that they stopped because I hang

Speaker 8:          01:37:56       out with comedians all the time, almost every night. So when I was in the room, I know what's funny and I know who's funny. You know what I mean? So it's amazing to me. It was scary. Like one guy, you know, one of the funniest people I've ever met used to do stand up and he doesn't, every time this guy opens his mouth, it's about to be an explosion. I mean, he has an Emmy for writing, but he's the king of roast riding. Like he's just an insult guru. So if you go, hey, what about Bobby, Bobby, you know, Jimi Hendrix or whatever, and 10 seconds later he'll have a, a gem that you can't not almost fall on the ground at. So, but yeah, I never did the entire time, my first few years writing, writing gigs, even during the season, if it got late in the office, eight nine, 10 like, hey guys, I got to go a do my spot. Sorry. But I'd also, I'd also churn it out so much during the day that they couldn't be like, well, you know, I didn't give them an option. I would, you know, hard all day. But I never, if I did that, if I missed a spot or something for a writing Gig, that would start an entire, whole nother crazy meltdown and breakdown because I just can't not do stand up crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       Well sure. You're always getting better too. I'll see you. I'll see you three months later. You're better. Three months later you'll be better than you were three months ago almost every time. And that means you're like constantly trying to refine and hone and that's when it becomes like a real obsession when you're like folding over your jokes and hammering them down, trying to get him to do, you got to do a lot of sets to do that. And if you have another gig that starts preventing you from doing that, he can become a real problem because you could just go, oh, you know what? I've got this. I'm just going to like, I'm just going to kick back, stop doing standup for a while. I'm gonna just take a few months off and just maybe I'll just, I mean, I'm not happy with my act right now.

Speaker 3:          01:39:41       And you come up with excuses and reasons and next thing you know, you've got some sort of a job. You're showing up at an office every day and you're mean you're writing. Yeah, it's great, but it's not as fun as stand up. You can't be. Exactly. But for some dudes, that stress of the performance is not worth, it's like a, it's not worth the effort. It's like, what's that expression? The juice like a, is it worth the juice to squeeze these berries? You know, is it worth the effort? Is it worth it? All this stress that you go through to get onstage and crack out a joke. I'd rather just write for someone else and have them deal with it. Yeah. That's not stress at all. I love churning those berries. You know what I'm saying? Why? But that's just you, right? Yeah. I mean for some guys it really is better for them to just be a writer. It's like this, this, the performance life is just too fucked up. It's too hard for them. I guess so, yeah. I think there's a lot of guys like that

Speaker 8:          01:40:36       couldn't get the spots, didn't meet the right people at the right time or something. I don't know. Maybe they weren't that funny of a performer. That is the one thing, you know, I don't know what those writers who I say are Hilarious, what their standups like. They've been in writer rooms for so long that they know how to be funny, like at a table. You know what I, when the

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       topic comes up, do you encourage people that you meet that are really funny to try to do stand up?

Speaker 7:          01:40:58       No, never. Never really. Never it. They gotta want to do it. That's one of those things where if you don't want it so bad that you like, you're crazy about it, then you're not going to do anything anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:41:11       You never planted that seed though. You never said to anybody you should probably use stand up.

Speaker 7:          01:41:16       I, you know, my whole podcast is pretty much based on helping people that want to do stand up, get better or grow or give them something or in any way shape or form or bring him down a peg if they're crazy. But um, I know I'm not into helping, I'm not into telling somebody that they should do something that's as extreme as standup. Like if they have, if that thought, if they haven't gone to an open mic and tried it then now I can't say,

Speaker 1:          01:41:46       you know why I say I do it is because I think there's certain people out there that really are funny and just need to hear like I just, a voice of encouragement can go a long way. There's a, I met dudes that my, I used to work for, guy was private investigator, one of the funniest guys I've ever met my life. His name is Dave Dolan. The great easily could have been a standup. He was a private investigator and he was really good at reading people. So he knew what a person's weakness was. He would talk to you for a couple seconds to just figure out what your thing was. New played dumb. He'd be like this dumb Boston guy. I can't, you know, you know, it was down here with a friend of mine and uh, we were looking for this guy that, uh, hit the, hit our car and took off and he would read off a license plate number.

Speaker 1:          01:42:26       It was very similar to their license plate number and that was how we got information out of people. He would just tell them about an accident that they weren't involved in and then he would start talking to them and they would start giving them information, but all kinds of shit about working while they're on unemployment. Oh, I'm using my maiden name, have a job. I'm like, we caught people doing shit like that all the time. Right. But the guy was hilarious. He would get in the car like after we had done that and we would, you know, we'd worked together as a team and he would be laughing his dick off and just saying all kinds of fucking crazy shit, you know? And he was just one of those guys that was just naturally funny. And I told him, I was like, look man, you're funnier than me and I'm doing standup. Like you should really do stand up. And he's like, look kid, I gotta pay the bills. Okay, this is what I do. I bust ass holes. Right. They just had this sort of way about them. Just knew how to just say the right thing. Yeah. It's like a craft that some guys have where they know when to say the right thing. Like is perfect example, right? You know when, when Eddie Bravo fought huddle Gracie, we called Joey Diaz, we had one speaker phone and the first thing he said is

Speaker 7:          01:43:28       child, the flags are at half mass knows

Speaker 1:          01:43:36       when to say the right shit. If Joey D is, if somebody's, I guess he probably decided to do it himself, but if nobody had ever talked to Joey Diaz and to doing stand up, that would have been a national tragedy. Yeah. I know a lot of what Joey did was in prison. Oh, who'd make prisoners laugh? Yeah. I, that's where he got good at it. They were like, he, they wouldn't show a movie if the movie sucked, they'd go get up there. Cocoa, get up there. Costco and Jelly would get up on stage and make everybody laugh and then nuts. Wow. When they tell the Joey Diaz life story, and I think somebody will do it, someone's going to fuck it up. Probably be Jonah Hill or something like that. Have some guys, not even Cuban. It'll be Adam Sandler was a fat suit. Adam was a big fan and really wants your trust in this project. He probably thinks that he could do it. It'd be like when people were outraged that Tom Cruise was going to play this stat and interview with the vampire kids crazy online petition against Tom cruise playing less data, but he's freaking the fuck out. That's it. It'd be like Jonah Hill was going to play Joey Diaz. Yeah. They'd be like, he's not even Cameron.

Speaker 7:          01:44:40       Hey, how are you? Cock suckers

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       and there be someone from like some Latino Association who would get on TV and say, you know, this is another theft from the Latino community. Someone has coming in and a non Latino is playing a Latino on TV in a movie about a Latino Star. Never. Yeah. Cubano he'll ideas. It's the best sauce of bashing. The other day at the ice house sold out the whole weekend. I didn't know so many people knew who Subash and why is that? Oh yeah, he was that big, but people were telling me, I will dude, he's huge. Sebastian's doing great. He had a showtime special, we talked about a showtime special on the podcast. I watched it in my hotel room. I was just flipping through the channels and I caught it. It was really funny. He's fucking good. He's doing really well. He, I, he always done well in certain spots.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       Like where people got to know him. He developed a following in Dallas years back. Like you do really well at the added that Addison Improv that places for dickless. Hmm. That's a great spot. That Addison Improv. Ooh, that's a great spot. That's what some wild people, there's still a lot of smoke indoors. I think we'd do like a late show and people would be smoking. I would go like, oh, this is crazy. You guys could smoke inside. Like it was her and it wasn't like one of those Vegas showrooms. Like you can smoke in Vegas, but if you go to any place in Vegas, they have those fucking industrial room cleansing machines, socking cigarette smoker. You Walk through the casino, you don't even realize it. All those people are smoking. Right? I mean, how often do you walk through the get mean? If you, if it's right on top of it, you smell it and it's kind of gross. But for the most part you're surrounded by people smoking cigarettes. You could barely tell. It's just shocking out that air and cleaning it up and giving you some fresh ambition. Air, some blackjack air.

Speaker 7:          01:46:23       That's how I got back on the smoke. So we were in Vegas just a couple of weeks ago. And you see these people smoking in the casino and this I, you know, it was just weird. I wasn't really, there wasn't really planning on smoking, but we got there and you just see these people smoking but you don't smell it. But it's indoors so it seems clean again, like the trickery work, my brain. Next thing you know, and when we met after we checked into our hotel rooms, I had a pack of cigarettes. Why don't we do the first time, find that

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       out. How do casinos kill the smell? Cigarettes? Cause they must, they must do something. We stayed at the Golden Nugget and we had got it to the smoking room there and the room smelled like the most cigarette I've ever seen. The golden nuggets, like the staple of Vegas. It's just hundreds of years of cigarettes though. Sinatra smoking there. Well, you know, they say there's third hand smoke. Do you ever hear about third hand smoke? They think that you go into a place like that that has been cigarette smokes. People have been smoking in there for years and years and years. It's actually in the walls itself. Like you're actually breathing in carcinogens. We're in a building, especially if anything catches fire or gets wet or has some sort of a chemical reaction to things that are in the room. Household cleaners and shit like that. It seems like something that you would have said like three years ago, you get cancer from third hand smoke. You're a fan, you're a pussy. Well, I'm not saying that it's anything you should worry about at a casino staying in a room for a night, but it's not good for you. That's for sure. If they find out that's true. Or if it gives you autism from smoke, like third hand smoke is, it seems like it would if it's like if you go to that golden nugget that we were at, that shit was disturbingly cigarettey so that place had like old school filters. Oh, it's supposed to be. The rooms felt like you were in an ashtray? Yeah, the,

Speaker 3:          01:48:09       there's a thing called the, okay. There's a thing called air fantastic. And they, uh, they have a solution for these kinds of things. It can reduce 99% of airborne particles, particulates, dust, pollen machines. Uh, this is kind of interesting. So I guess it just sucks all the air out of the room and cleans it while you're in there, Huh? Yeah. That's pretty impressive. 99% of airborne particulates, Jay Z. It's like a study from a West Texas a and m particulates in cigarette smoke are positively charged, which keeps them airborne. The ions produced are negatively charged and so the particles, the particles are neutralized and fall to the ground. Whoa, that's crazy. So this shit does something to the very air around you that causes the particles from cigarettes to fall so they don't stay in the air and linger like that's what's going on. What the fuck is that about? That's weird, man. Crystal Clear experiment was proven in Austin's yellow rose gentleman's club in 2003, which installed eight of our 14 inch probes. That's hilarious. That's their first fucking customer. Finally, we got one bull is a titty bar taken us in and we're going to revolutionize this game. The bar would be packed with many smokers and the air was crystal clear and one could not even see, uh, on particle. They should say one particle but says aunt on particle, you fucking no spellcheck. Motherfuckers read your own shit. How come someone has

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       a website that you don't even read your own shit? That makes me wonder if the product is a, they could not see one particle. You fucks in the bright spot. Okay. All right. Well that's just one company that sells something. But obviously there's something like that. So they have, uh, some way to remove this stuff. There's more than one company is another called Era Roma Air Zone. So I guess they do something. Huh? I wonder if that's bad for you though. Whatever the fuck they're doing to the air, it seems like it would be like, it's good, right? Yeah. I don't know what the fuck that is. You got to do something. If it's to the air, how will do you have to be to smoke? 18 set in New York just passed 21 which is super smart. Yeah, it should be fucked. That 21 you got to got to stop.

Speaker 4:          01:50:34       You're not going to stop people. I think if you want to figure out a way to keep people from smoking cigarettes, you're going to have to find some sort of a, a pill. Then that allows them to quit really easily. It just kills the addiction. No withdrawal symptoms because otherwise the majority of people love pleasure and they hate discomfort so much that the idea of being without a cigarette and having a Pang and a craving is too much and they just cave in. Yeah. It's amazing that Nabisco's down with that. Yeah. The people that sell us those fine cookies and crackers, they also sell cigarettes. I mean, how coke greedy do you have to be? Fucks how much money you make it from you crackers so much enough fucking money. Why do you have to sell cigarettes? It's all that stuff. You know those little sticks with the little cheese.

Speaker 4:          01:51:21       What are those handy snacks? Oh yeah. Four little white sticks with the cheese. Same people. How weird. Kraft is a Nabisco company, so all that cheese, Oreos, Oreos, a big one. How weird is it that in this day and age, with all the information that we have now, we don't hold someone accountable for something like that. We don't say, why are you selling that? Like, I mean, well, people have the right to choose what they want to do and a lot of Americans enjoy a cigarette. It's amazing. That was the scariest to me, honestly, is really McDonald's. Because why? Because everybody's so taught that it's Mcdonald's. It's America. This is, this is good. You can, you can, you can have, this is fine. It's just cocacola fries, whatever. This burger is made up. Yeah, but that doesn't make you, well, I guess it does a certain amount of addiction, right?

Speaker 4:          01:52:15       Oh yeah. It teaches you to eat whatever preservatives are fine. It teaches you that eat, eat garbage. If it tastes good, that's all that matters. I'm loving it. Yeah, but is it, is it doing that or is it just giving you that as an option to like, why is that any different than a donut shop? I like donuts. I don't eat them all the time, but I like the fact that there's a donut shop. Or if I pull into Dunkin donuts and I say, Oh, I have a cup of coffee and a Boston cream donut please. And I get excited and I'll have about 1520 seconds of mouth pleasure, and then a few hours of regret. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       But I liked it. That's available. That Mcdonald's

Speaker 7:          01:52:49       [inaudible] donuts, a special treat. I think you go to a, you get a donut that's like, I'm going to pick out my doughnut. This was baked today. Mcdonald's is like, that's really the commercial, you know, the commercials between everything. It's sort of like, hey, and they're the number one toy producer in the country. Donald. All those happy meals because we're teaching kids, hey, eat this. It doesn't matter what this Burger is actually made out of.

Speaker 3:          01:53:12       You know, San Francisco outlawed toys and happy meals.

Speaker 7:          01:53:15       That's smart. Is it? Yeah. I'm telling you, man, you can't just eat whatever you want. You can, but you can sometimes make you depressed. It's going to make you angry. You're going to wonder why you feel crappy. I mean, at least that's how it was with me. That's why I had to get off. That's to Mcdonald's. Yeah. I had it last night at like quarter pounder. It was like, yeah, we know it tastes good. That's, that's part of the fries. The fries. Yeah. But nowadays they, they, they're getting sued by so many people that like, you know, the oils, they cook it in now or a lot healthier than they used to be. The, and the, the, the, the quarter pounder, the kerosene that they cook, the burgers. Any food you make is going to have oils. I know. Yeah. But, but uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:53:59       Yeah. I mean, because a lot of people, when they seem their salary, they're always worried about that goddamn oil that comes with it. Welcome to Greenly my salad. I know there's going to be oil except I meant when I eat anything with that needs a whale like fries or something like that. Or if you cook, you can cook them in duck fat. Remember that one place in Vegas when we go to a craft stake, God damn son, they bring over these duck fat fries. Good googly Mowgli. Are they good? One. One, one, one, one, one, one. They bring them over with three different types of dipping sauce. Oh, but it's the duck fat. That's what does it? Those fries, those McDonald's fries. That shit's wack. So delicious. They have the best ride. Mcdonald's. Yeah, you're crazy. In and out. He's worries. Make Tom in announced. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:54:43       Hardboard no, no, no. It's like a real potato. You fuck it actually tastes like a potato in and out is fucking fantastic. Oh good. It's good. I don't think they'd beat Mcdonald's fries. You know it's better than both of them. Better than both of them. Five guys fries, burglaries them in the fucking ground. How dare you nod your head. Side to side. Jamie, you son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. Trust me. Five guys fries. Fox, everybody up. Plus they have a Cajun version. You can get Cajun fries. Oh, what did I say? Yes, they give it to you in a fucking, like one of those movie was movie barrels where they give you popcorn after they give you your fries. You never need all your fries at five guys. Good fucking luck.

Speaker 7:          01:55:22       Cajun seasoning is the, uh, the best can. I mean, that just makes anything better. All Freezer, all fries are good for at the Cajun. But five guys does have a great Friday.

Speaker 3:          01:55:32       I usually don't fuck with Cajun spices on steak. I usually like steak, you know, like pepper and salt and that's it. But I had occasion Ribeye at, uh, that place we went to the other day. Lordy.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Oh, it was perfect. Not too overpowering. Just that right amount of spice. Oh yeah. Their day. That looks amazing. Of what delicious steak you're reading or meat. Oh, uh, which one was it? Oh, the bear. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That was, uh, not the one I shot. That was one that was, uh, someone in camp shot. It was the first time I ever, well, I had bear sausage before that I liked. Um, but I'd never had like a bear stake, like right off the bear was it taste like taste delicious. Very Gamey. Is it is it tastes like a pig. Fucked a deer and you had to cook it. Well done. That's good. Yeah. Well the problem with bear is the same problem with pork and it's that they eat animals and when they eat animals, you have to worry about them having tricky gnosis because tricker gnosis comes from eating an animal that has tricky gnosis.

Speaker 1:          01:56:33       So like a aisle, they say 90% of all the cases of tricking osis according to my friend Steve Rinella, 90% occur in the United States from people eating bears. Whoa. Yeah. That's the 90% of our cases of chicken houses. Think about how few people in the United States eat bears, but that's 90% of the trickiness cases as his bears are. Um, they're, they're predators. I mean, they eat everything. They eat berries, but they also eat animals. They're responsible for like half of the Moose population. When you are in Alberta where I was at half the babies get eaten by by bears. Weren't you scared to eating that like turning trick? I mean getting turned to a bear?

Speaker 13:         01:57:17       No, just you have to cook it to 150 degrees. What's see what's, I think bear meat would probably be super delicious if you were able to

Speaker 1:          01:57:27       cook it medium rare. I would like to try it that way because uh, it's, it's good. Um, in comparison to like a like beef or something like that, it has a more robust flavor. Like, and if you, if you cook it like thin and you have to kind of cook it well done, it is very good but is not as good as deer or elk because deer elk, you eat like a medium rare, almost a rare and it's delicious. Like you see her like, like a deer loin. You would take a slice of it, you'd put like some pepper and maybe some garlic salt on it and you would see writ on one side and sear it on the other side. It's fantastic. You know, you don't really have to cook it that much because they don't have the same type of, uh, parasites that pigs do.

Speaker 1:          01:58:09       So when you have pig, you always have to like that smoke pig was amazing. That ham that I made. But you have to cook that for a long time. It's got to be cooked all the way through and it really breaks it down and it becomes delicious. But it has to hit 150 degrees if it doesn't hit 150 degrees, that and Osis if it has it and it may not, but if it does have it, you could get it. So in that sense, pigs and Behr are very similar. I liked them a lot, but I prefer, um, deer and elk and animals that you could eat medium rare. Have you ever done the duck shooting? Like the, no, it seems like as you would love that because that seems like target practice. I wake like you're just like, yeah. Um, the only problem that I have with that, and it's just a small moral problem, is that a lot of those ducks, you just sorta clipping them, like you're like tagging their, their wings with like pebbles, you know, like you're shooting shotgun pellets and if you ever watch those things, a lot of those ducks are like still flying after they get hit and then they stumble and they lose a lot of ducks that way.

Speaker 1:          01:59:07       Like ducks just fly off cause it seems kind of not specific, like you're shooting at them. Boom, boom. But they spread out, the pellets spread out. And in a lot of ways, and this is not a criticism of duck hunting, I would totally do it, but it just, there's one thing that fucks with me and that's that I think that a lot of them, you're like barely going to hit. You're going to hit like a wing or a foot blow a foot off, and then they're still gonna fly away. You know, you're going to shoot a lot of them and drop them out of the sky. But if I, you know, if you could shoot one duck at a time with a rifle, you could tune in on that doc. You've got a cross hair on it, boom, the ducks gone. But when you're pumping, led into the air [inaudible] you ever watch those duck shows?

Speaker 1:          01:59:45       Like sometimes they get them dead on, but sometimes they like catch him and there was spiral and they're, you know, they're, they're fine. They just fucked up, you know, which happens with hunting too. Um, it happens especially with the archery hunting. Archery hunting is super dangerous and it's dangerous. Obviously for the animal, it's super dangerous, but it's dangerous that you could, there's a danger, a great dangerous should say that you can wound an animal and not fatally wounded. So you have to fucking practice like crazy. It's really difficult to, to shoot straight like you think like a bow and arrow. Today's bows and arrows are way easier than the bows and arrows of cowboy and Indian days or the Mongol days. They're way better. I mean, they have super high technology of the sites on them. The arrows fly straighter. They're like aluminum jacketed arrows. The um, the compound bows allow you to pull like a heavy weight and it, there's a lead off like an 80 pound bows, like 80 pounds in the beginning.

Speaker 1:          02:00:38       But then back here it's only probably like 20% of that. So like when you have it at full draw, you can hold onto it at full draw, but it's hard to stay steady. It's hard to keep that pin lined up on the animal and you've got to [inaudible] especially a bear when they're coming out of hibernation. Their lungs are only that big. They're small. They're like, like a small volleyball size, you know, like one of those kids volleyball's it's not like a big long, like a deer has a big long and l has a big lung because they're in the high mountains, they're running around all the time. It's, they have a lot of, but when these bears are coming out of hibernation, it's a very small area that you have to hit. So it's not easy, man. It takes a long fucking time to get to a point where you, you, you trust in your aim enough that you're willing to take a shot at an animal with a bow and arrow. Serious Shit. Um, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:01:29       Know anything about that stuff you said cowboys and Indians and bears. I just keep thinking I'm helping blown my mind is that the village people wrote the original, I'm a Gigolo. Like can you imagine how many van Halen fans would get into an argument not believing that the village people did that first and what sounded like a little bit of a catchy or version if you ask me, like I sort of liked that hoppy beat,

Speaker 3:          02:01:55       I think to bring it around full circle. Those guys were kind of bear.

Speaker 7:          02:02:00       Yeah, exactly. Because the barest one was the fucking motorcycle cop or the, uh, the biker guy. They shot their arrows into each other. There's a lot of references.

Speaker 3:          02:02:11       Yeah. So how many sit online that just Jessa Jiggle it actually was written by somebody even before that. Uh, I can't find it now. I, it was that guy cares. I believe that. Yeah. That makes sense. A lot of those songs are like old, you know, it's, it sucks when you find out that your favorite version of the song was like a remake you. Yeah. Or that they ripped it off from somebody. Like bill burr called me up once and he's like, you're not even going to fucking believe this. Go look up. Led Zepplin rips off. He'd go, just go, go look that up and listen to it. And there's like a compilation with a made a youtube compilation of led Zeppelin songs and comparison to the songs they ripped off. They're getting sued right now from that one guy that sounded exactly like, it's devastating.

Speaker 3:          02:02:57       It's devastating you, you, I mean, I fucking love Zeplin Dude. I mean, and I can't take away, it doesn't take away from my love of those creations, those songs, because the songs are still fucking incredible, but obviously obviously any song in a band is a collaboration and it appears to me that this was like an unwilling collaboration. That's how I would put it. It was someone else's art that they appropriated and made a part of their art and they created something amazing and that is essentially what plagiarism is. If those guys had been a part of the team and they work together, you know, and this guy like, you know you need cool then baby, I'm not a fool man. I'm going to send you back to school and you know, and the guy writes it all down, you're like Yay. I like it. I like it.

Speaker 3:          02:03:45       Like let's go with it. That would be fine. But if you hear that somewhere else and then you just stick that in your song, it doesn't make your song awesome. No doubt. Whole lot of love. It's one of my favorite songs of all time, but that shit is almost directly ripped off from some old blues song. I mean like a lot of the lines like our directly ripped off from an old blues song. It's hard to listen to man. Yeah. If you just type in led Zepplin like plagiarism. TMZ, there's like one from 2010. There's one from 2014. There's one thing that goes, it's just like a whole bunch of different songs and lawsuits that have almost all their songs are rip offs. That's so crazy. Yeah. I wonder if that's going to cost them all their money. That'd be fucking weird if all of a sudden led Zeppelin went broke. Like all those guys were broke as fuck. Robert Palmer starts going on the road. He's doing cover songs cause he owes all this money and you want to hear one of the, the the rip offs of Fuck Yeah. This is according to the lawsuit, uh, for dazed, confused, you know. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:04:39       Love that God damn song

Speaker 1:          02:04:41       here is one of their big ones. Here is the uh, I guess the rib offers.

Speaker 4:          02:04:49       Oh Great. That's the way. That's the real version. That's okay. Play in both playing together.

Speaker 14:         02:05:00       Yeah. Stays it Bobby and shoes.

Speaker 4:          02:05:12       Clue as to where it's the name of that band cause led Zepplin who's than a hundred million Jake Holmes. This is not bad though. Play that a little bit more and that's the deal.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       The only part is she. Okay. And here, you know, of course the other one is

Speaker 4:          02:05:29       right. Mother fucker

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       crazy.

Speaker 15:         02:05:38       Lots of people talk, few of them know was created.

Speaker 1:          02:05:48       Dave, they're better. I'm sorry. I'm going to do the the Mexican woman in the crowd. Yeah,

Speaker 15:         02:05:57       right. Yo, Yo, Yo, he did it better.

Speaker 1:          02:06:05       Yeah, I mean for sure. At the very least they were influenced, but God damned. Their lyrics are better. The delivery was off the charts.

Speaker 4:          02:06:14       That's a fancy studio though. I'd like to see that Jake guy in the same studio. This studio band was a mother fucker son. That is undeniable. It was not just a studio. It was the fucking output. Just that guy's voice, that output. Who the fucking hit those notes. Who can even seem like that? You know who the fuck things like that man, play that shit again. Play the Robert Plant version again. Just play it. Play that part. I'm way past that now. I can do it fellow. You can do it. I know. You know how to use the Internet to find the

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       the stairway to heaven one because it was way back, but I just want to hear that real quick. It's gonna be a better producer boy.

Speaker 4:          02:06:58       Damn

Speaker 1:          02:06:58       San Antonio now on him. That was a crazy time. You talked to Joey Diaz about led Zeppelin. If you want to get the, if led Zeppelin was smart, they would hire Joey Diaz to narrate their life story to just do a documentary where Joey Diaz just explains led Zepplin. Let me tell you something, brother fucking dirty white guys from swinging Dick on stage with fucking tights on tights on Joe Rogan. These giant cock is inches away from women's faces and they're fucking losing their minds. They never seen nothing like this before. He talks to you about like the invasion, like when LEDs up and first hit America, I'm doing it. No, you have to

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       hear him describe it. Like would that song, the sound was, like I said, nobody had a sound like that before. So this is total new next level shit that has opened up the door to a lot of people's, changed a lot of people's idea what songs sounded like. Stairway to heaven. And I'm one of those guys. I love, love, I love led Zeppelin but I'm one of those guys that puts pink Floyd ahead of them any day of the week. And that's interesting. And put up a strong case for I know it. I don't think you could. Oh yeah. Cause it's better for you. But for me it's up. It's better than pink Floyd. But Pink Floyd's a fucking fucking amazing. What does this sit again? This is the whole, this is the guy. Look at the guy above ground sound okay

Speaker 12:         02:08:18       of Jack Holmes. Is Jack Holmes dead? Cause that'd be super ironic. Jake Holmes. That's definitely the baseline.

Speaker 14:         02:08:35       No doubt

Speaker 12:         02:08:41       she's sitting on his balls in this country in shoes. Just Woo. That's pretty God. Damn good dude. Be a clue as to

Speaker 15:         02:08:51       do you lock a mouse and yeah, I like it.

Speaker 12:         02:08:56       God damn good. I it's different but it's pretty good. Pretty damn good. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         02:09:02       Hi. And I'm being abused. And this Jesus is the crack and see how he breaks it down the right track.

Speaker 4:          02:09:24       All right guys. It wow comes early.

Speaker 4:          02:09:29       That's pretty God damn good dude. Yeah. Especially because it's, that's the original. So you gotta think like it's, it's much easier to listen to someone and then add a bunch of shit to something that they've sort of the foundation. Then the come up with the original idea. Totally. You know, that's, but that's the joke thief way. That's what joke thieves do. They'll take your premise and then they change it enough so that they can get, they can get away with it because they made it better. Yeah. They just said more to the backend. So let's hear the, the Robert Plant part. Okay. Hold on a sec. Yeah, I mean that's almost like, exactly.

Speaker 16:         02:10:08       Well those are the,

Speaker 4:          02:10:10       and Jake's version does a courts and this is

Speaker 12:         02:10:13       good. Tell so long. That's not true. Come on. I want to fuck him. And I'm a guy that I'm telling you, these guys have these guys said such better

Speaker 10:         02:10:32       access. You would be in love

Speaker 12:         02:10:42       if you were in the audience and you saw this, you'd be in love. Be So enthralled, especially 1971 or whatever. Fuck it was. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         02:10:55       it's beautiful.

Speaker 5:          02:10:59       All right. Hair is a rip off for sure. Check the yet. Definitely. Now rip fucking off here is though. This one I thought was kind of messed up cause this guy even toward, I guess with,

Speaker 12:         02:11:10       that's, that's the true medicine. That's the Ari Shapiro opening.

Speaker 5:          02:11:15       It's called the Freddy Soto. This is a group called Taurus and the song spirit and it's the one that's there. They're saying is from a stairway to heaven. So here is a spirit first.

Speaker 3:          02:11:28       Look how weird they look. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:11:30       See, these are the people that don't make it. The ones that look a little weird like give it, they wanted a pretty boy.

Speaker 3:          02:11:36       Yeah. That guy looks like can Rigo Montoya you killed my parents who killed my father. Prepare to die. Do, don't, don't hate on the man's art. It's changed like it. It's scary. He's got a funky mustache on one side and the other dude is bald headed. You can be bald headed in 1971 or whatever the fuck this was.

Speaker 12:         02:12:12       Oh God. Oh led Zepplin. Oh my God.

Speaker 10:         02:12:25       Oh my God,

Speaker 12:         02:12:30       fine. Please don't steal our song. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          02:12:47       Where's this song though? This is all music. I think. I'm pretty sure that this song doesn't have lyrics. I think this was a notes here. Really?

Speaker 10:         02:12:58       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         02:13:00       Well they, they got weird, but it's their creation, but they took it to a weird place that it's the spirit of the song right there. Absolutely. That's the song. Yeah. I mean that's where it's easy when you hear something like this,

Speaker 5:          02:13:15       just sort of create and she's

Speaker 3:          02:13:21       see cause like you feel how it bugs you or how it hits you rather. And then you add your creativity to it.

Speaker 5:          02:13:28       Right. The writing though, that's, that's

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       it in the lyrics isn't the hardest part of the sun. The hardest part of a song is that part is that backbone, that spinal cord of what's original. What's different. I would've, I would've assumed that you're right, but I don't know Jack Shit about music. How much do you know about music? A pretty good amount. I can play a lot of things. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Do Piano. I have what they call perfect pitch. You know what that is? You're a girl. No, no perfect pitch is like one or two, one or 2% of, they don't know why it's not like genetic or anything, but one or 2% of people can hear music like exactly. So that if I play something or if I'm in front of an instrument, I can remember where that sound is and know that it's a hard thing to explain, but I can hear at the exact tone of each.

Speaker 7:          02:14:21       How do you know, um, you find out when if you take like piano lessons or like, yeah, we are your people that play by ear often have perfect pitch. If you've ever heard that term. Like there's people that can read music and play and then there's people that can really like pick the Beethoven play. Perfect pitch is a perception thing. It's not like a singer. I thought it was like a singing thing. It's on a sound that you, well, I know, well if, let's say that it's singing for example, like I know if I hit the note exactly so it makes it a lot easier to hit the note if you know that, huh? Yeah. I thought it was an ability thing, like a, the hitting notes. I didn't know it was being able to perceive it. I thought it was just a setup to make a sound that you can still, you can learn it.

Speaker 7:          02:15:09       Not Perfect pitch, but you can learn how to make a sound. Can you totally do. I mean, do you have limitations on what? Like I don't think I could ever be a good singer. I know. I really don't think I have any singing talent. Like, Oh, you'd be surprised. Like Vicky Lewis who was on news radio has an insane voice, like insane, like opera level voice like she can, and I would, I would like a church joke around, tried to sing. She would get offended. Like it was disgusting to her because my clunky voice, I just, I don't, I can't just hit songs, but I've met people that they don't even sing for a living. Right. But they could sound, they sound beautiful when they're singing. Right. Well, it all depends. Like everybody should just try to sing like themselves. I just learned about this stuff recently, the singing part of things for that one thing that I didn't care anyway.

Speaker 7:          02:15:55       Um, but like you have to sing in your singing voice. You know how all this singer sound different, you know, Clapton and Tom Petty, hey, is everybody doing it? They like, he doesn't try to sing like La la, la, la, la, la La. He just goes with it and she's a new can girl. You know what I mean? Right. So if you sing like how you sound instead of trying to sing like what we think a good singer sounds like, then you can kill it because everybody sounds different. They'll call and sounds different than Roger Waters. Cause according to David Gilmore road, Robert Plant. Yeah. I knew this dude who was in a, and it was super

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       cocky dude. And then I finally listened to his music. He's cocky, bordering Douchey, and I listened to some music and the guy sounded exactly like Chris Cornell. And when I say exactly, I mean fucking exactly. I thought it was like some lost Soundgarden song from the early days. I was listening to the exact same, that same influx. It was like me doing a Joey Diaz impression. Yeah. Like if I just started talking like Joey Diaz or a onstage look, if I went on stage and just pretend that this is me now and now what's up cock sucker. Where you at? Bitch, come on. You would go, oh my God, he's, he's doing a Joey Diaz impression, right? That's how much this guy sounded like Chris Cornell. Oh yeah, we got, we got, you're a Voodoo. Punani Nah, don't play it away. How dare you. Different voices are fun. That's why I like the crash test dummies. You ever heard of them? Yeah. Talks like this and everything. And then when this song comes in, it's like a totally different, you can't fuck with checks though. Chicks of the best sounding voices. My opinion, I mean, I like Robert Plant. He's got a bad ass voice. But Janis Joplin, if I had to choose between listening to Janis Joplin sang a song or Robert Plant, Oh yeah, that checked that things gold finger pull up. Take another little piece of my heart.

Speaker 9:          02:17:46       Why are you laughing? You don't know that Janis Joplin Song. Right? It's great to take it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:54       She was a fucking genius or me and Bobby McGee. That's another one. She was a god damn genius. Yeah. Roller Skates is great. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:18:06       Yeah, that's right. We're the beamer

Speaker 3:          02:18:09       or ways a Mercedes Benz. Oh Lord.

Speaker 9:          02:18:19       When I see shit like this, when I listen to this, I see in my head like a documentary on the sixties toe. That's what I see a politician talking about. These were innocent times for scoring people. This summer we're embracing this new wave of, of being there was sweeping the nation and uh, we were a part of it. We were at ground zero. Yeah, it was Berkeley in 1969 and it was all going on. It was the freedom of summer put play and pick her up. Crank her up,

Speaker 15:         02:18:51       listen to this town.

Speaker 9:          02:19:16       No one of the things is so bad ass about her when she would sing the pain in her voice, like the emotions, her voice

Speaker 3:          02:19:27       that check and experienced a lot of shit.

Speaker 7:          02:19:30       It's one of those ones that we get into it too. She put her whole body and close their eyes really get lost in it

Speaker 15:         02:19:41       and she was ugly. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          02:19:42       she, she was ugly and she hooked up with a lot. Are Rock stars good for her big time. Everybody wanted her even though she was ugly. Every guy wanted a banger cause they're like that fucking voice. She's got no tits, no ass in the face of it.

Speaker 6:          02:19:56       Of a guitar. The Hell Charlie Brown or female? Charlie Brown. Yeah, he's awesome. Come on, Joey did. That is scary. Oh my God. Is that her? Is that the exorcist is, she looks like gimme it get a good picture of it. Find a good picture of her and I say ugly, like she's better looking than me. How's it girl? I don't know. She's pretty scary, right? Like your ass instead of hers. I think you could probably look my ass. Period. Just for a story. Just to be able to go on and kill Tony talking about she was okay. Hippie chick put up a good one.

Speaker 3:          02:20:37       Oh my tutee. Oh, there's a cute, if you're on acid, you'd see your soul, your lower soul or souls. Beautiful. Complex. Like an old wine. It's got that. Face flies. I bet. How dare you. Oh, my teeth are a little crooked. Other than that, it's fine looking Gal. Everything's crooked. Look at that thing rude. It's got demos through one side of her face. If I had to choose one woman to listen to sing and she's up there. Amy Winehouse, she's up there to Suzanne Santo from honey. Honey, it's right at the top of the God damn list. She's got some new songs. I wish we could play him, but she didn't give me permission. I play uh, some of our new shit. God Damn Dude. Black women, man, I want to shoot a lot of things. She'd let us play. Are we allowed to? Oh sure. I'm glad too.

Speaker 7:          02:21:18       Black women have this thing where they have the most powerful vocal chords. That lady that sings gold finger from bond. Did you ever see that live performance like the Oscars or Emmy's? A couple of years ago she got a standing ovation afterwards. Solution Super. I, it's, I can't believe, I can't think of her name. She's the, she's like the most respected Grace Jones, something like that. If you're just here, if you look up gold finger, I guess Grace Jones. Grace Jones was that black chick with the crazy haircut. Yeah, like that Max head. You're in black mixed hedge Max headroom. Grace Jones was a, she used to date Dolph Lundgren. Surely Lacey. Yeah, that surely Basset, right? Yeah. She is a cold blooded killer. This is one where she got it and when she does that, she's standing in when she, she can clincher arms and it makes the sound come from Kohl's. She didn't, she know Polo and then go low to high her range, which is thing. Some people can do high, some people can do low. She's one of those monsters. A lot

Speaker 12:         02:22:25       of those guys clapped and pink Floyd. They'd only work with black nurse home owner. That's what it was. Yeah. Everything sounds better with a half boner.

Speaker 3:          02:22:34       Yeah. Pull up a honey honey. Uh, Angel of death when they were alive on the roof. This a video that they did. I wanted to play one of the new songs, but I can't get permission. So, uh, it till I hear from her, I sent her a text. If she texted me back during the shovel, we'll try to play it, but a video we're in. Yeah, that's angel of death. But don't play that one. Play the live one on the roof because the live one on the roof is acoustic, so you really get a chance to, to hear her voice. This is a net, Brian, is it? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 15:         02:23:05       It's Tony Chirping. It's me.

Speaker 12:         02:23:08       Yeah. This is how I found out about these guys. They're moving back to la. They gave up on Nashville. God, they heard that a few too many n bombs and they were like, oh, we're still in Tennessee called angel of death

Speaker 16:         02:23:31       loaded until, ah, fine.

Speaker 10:         02:23:36       Do you,

Speaker 16:         02:23:44       isn't this an old village people song? Let's say, we'll just say they never spend a single day.

Speaker 10:         02:24:03       I bet she's got talent.

Speaker 16:         02:24:06       Yes. Yes. There have been many.

Speaker 10:         02:24:13       Oh

Speaker 16:         02:24:15       yes, I have treated them as you tease day class Manny from Manny to you. Hey, I need to see them live again.

Speaker 12:         02:24:48       Yeah, they're uh, they're moving back here, so we'll get to see him for sure. Tell me back. Yeah, she's the best. And should they have a new tour out and uh, yeah. If you go to a honey honey band. Dot. Yeah. Dot

Speaker 3:          02:24:57       Com. Um, they, uh, they have their, their schedule up. It's there. They're fucking awesome. And Ben is the coolest guy. He's so nice. He's such an interesting, funny dude too. He's a cool guy to be around. It's interesting. No one people that can do shit that you don't have any interest in pursuing. You get to just watch it. Like as an observer. That's how I feel about, about music. You know, music is not something that I ever wanted to pursue. So when I watched people do it and it really good, I find it super inspiring.

Speaker 8:          02:25:25       I never would've gotten into it at all. However, I lived in such a bad neighborhood. I grew up in such a, the worst corner of one of the most dangerous cities in the country for years it's been dangerous. But when I was growing up, it was the most dangerous. It's just houses getting our sand everywhere. Makes Detroit look like Youngstown, Ohio. Yeah, that's a bad, it's very dangerous. The mafia versus the black gangs and the, the black gangs versus everybody. Notoriously one of the worst cities to live in year after year. But anyway, we had bars and all of our windows. Uh, it's just a thing that every house had during that time, uh, late eighties, early nineties, because people would just, if they saw you leave your house, they break into your house and steal whatever. But the only area that didn't have bars in the windows was our dining room, a window area.

Speaker 8:          02:26:14       But since we, there weren't bars in the windows. We, my mom had an old upright piano that leaned up against those windows, so the light wouldn't even come through the windows. The only thing that would block those windows was an upright piano. So there was always an upright piano in the dining room when I was being raised. So I'd play it and just goof around on it as a kid. But sure enough, just to show you how bad of a neighborhood I lived in one time, because there were bars on the windows, a guy with like an ax started breaking through that window and broke all the way through a piano and upright piano. If you know anything about the guts of a piano, I'm in, first of all, the outsides made a crazy old wood and this and that, and it's all wood on the inside.

Speaker 8:          02:26:53       But there's all these metal strings and everything. They broke all the way through the piano. Whoa. That's Youngstown for you. Just the guy that started, he's like, God, I gotta be close now. Broke through the middle of an upright piano. And what happened to get inside your house? I remember they got inside my house, they stole a mine Nintendo and the VCR, which now would be, I mean the oldest intent, the regular Nintendo and a VCR. Probably today's like $20 worth of stuff breaking. Um, remember pretty specifically. I know I was close to probably about third, fourth or fifth grade writing there. I know that because my first grade play Christmas play was in the VCR. It was so funny and we used to watch, I used to, I mean everybody in the family used to watch it because it was so stupid. I was, I was a star and I had a giant head and I was so unacceptable. Like they didn't want to give me a good role, so they just put a star around my neck with a string. So we'd always watch it cause it'd be funny in that. And that was in the VCR when they stolen, there was no way to get that back, you know? So that's why it really stuck out hock. Yeah. Really

Speaker 3:          02:27:57       be a weird feeling to, to feel that vulnerable. Like someone could break in

Speaker 8:          02:27:59       every night. I was scared every single night. Every single night I went to better phrase, right.

Speaker 3:          02:28:04       We caught somebody breaking into my house when I was really just, it was like there weren't no, no, I should, I should correct. It wasn't, they weren't breaking in my house. They're breaking in our car, which to right. Right by the window. And um, I'm sure somebody probably would have broken into our house, but we were home. They probably knew her home. I lived in Jamaica

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       plain, which was not nearly as bad as Youngstown, but it was, it was sketchy, especially now that now it's all gentrified. But back then it was pretty fucked up and we caught, this dude was right outside my window. He's breaking into a car. I remember seeing him run, who's my, my stepfather opened up the window and yelled something or something. I forget. There was some sort of an altercation, like get the fuck out of there. And then I remember like looking down, because I had a, with my window, my bedroom window was above the car looking down and seeing this guy run off. I was like, this is fucking

Speaker 7:          02:28:48       Gary. Yeah. Really. It's really gross when you realize that somebody could mess with your stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:28:56       Well, it's a weird feeling too. Like you don't hear noises and then you think this might really be someone breaking in this time. Beanies. That's what they would call them. Kids in the neighborhood would do it all the time. Oh, you know, he's been to Juvie for a beanie. It was like normal breaking an entering. Yeah. Normal. No murders, bacon and eggs over there. Very few murders. Just a lot of crime. But it was, it was possible to get murdered. You know when you have a bunch of fucking creepy people that had been in jail a bunch of times and they're around a bunch of other creepy people and there's a lot of poverty and a lot of drugs and fucking shit happens, man

Speaker 7:          02:29:28       kicking it all becomes acceptable. And then the little brother is, and the, and the younger people see their older brother's doing it and they think it's cool and that that's a part of life. And then, you know, it's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:29:39       It's also a weight. Guys make money, you know, to be honest, to break into someone's house, you steal their TV and now you have a thousand bucks, like, Holy Shit. Yeah. It's fucked. The that, that doesn't happen too much in rich neighborhoods. Rich neighborhoods. Dude's very rarely break into each other's houses. Super Rare. Yeah. It's something that only happens if one person's got something, the other person wants it. What do you can get your own shit? Shit doesn't mean as much. That becomes a different thing. Become something. How you judge each other. That's where it's stupid, but a lot fucking better than living in poverty. Yeah. Yeah. It was crazy. Youngest had a lot of boxers come out of there. A lot of them. Boom, boom, man. Sini Kelly the ghost town. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:30:17       Kelly Perry Roya. How are you? Royal. Wow. Kelly Pavlock had my favorite fight that I've ever seen in all of boxing. The Jermaine Taylor fied. Yeah, yeah. Got An iPhone twice. They both, neither one of them had ever been knocked down in their entire professional career. Not once. And they both went down twice.

Speaker 1:          02:30:35       It was a great fight. Yeah. Pavlik was a beast. Like the booze though. That's it. Yeah, that'll fuck you man. But again, I think a lot of these guys that liked the booze part of it is just the pressure. Yeah. You know, the pressure of being a professional fighter has gotta be so staggering.

Speaker 7:          02:30:50       And in Youngstown, that's what your Todd is. His drink, the pain away. When he, every time he would go back home, he was the king of Youngstown down. And when you do that, you're just hanging out at bars with your friends anyway. And every single person that walks in, hey, let me buy you a drink. It's months until your next fight. You know, they don't realize it's a professional athlete and he needs to make your mind. Kelly, what do you exactly how everybody talks too good for a Jack Gum on Kelly. Let me buy you a drink. Jack on the rocks. Muck killing white

Speaker 8:          02:31:19       castle, big whiskey and a beer and ain't going to hurt you. You know, I didn't know that white castle had tiny food the first time I went there. And so I got it go. I got it to go. I remember specifically, I was at my brother's apartment in Columbus visiting him in college. Went to the white castle. He was at work across the street, got a burger and fries to go, went back and I was so disappointed because I was starving. Went back and got three or four more burgers. Yeah, those were the days. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:31:49       How'd they get away with that? Just making a little tiny burger. Super cheap. One Bite Burger.

Speaker 11:         02:31:52       They used to be a nickel or something like that to daddy and it was, that was the whole thing and like get a nickel burger, you know? But it was a smart man. But yeah, I mean how many of those, it was a regular burger, a quarterback. Then how much is the regular burger? Probably it was probably more expensive. It was. It probably some kind of marketing thing like, no, we got right like cheap burgers and Nicole Beggs. Yeah, news breaking news. Joe, do you see that thing I posted the other day? Did you know the U S P s or the post office used to deliver kids. They used to put the postage on the kid and these carriers would have these babies and they would just like take me on the train with them and then it started like, like getting out more. And they may use Snopes this. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's real. Totally real shy, shy

Speaker 3:          02:32:33       babies through the mail. Photos of it. Yeah. You guys, what year was this? Early Thirties, I believe. Oh, so people were just worried that baby's going to get eaten by wolves back down. They took a chance to the post office. Yeah. But the people that would deliver him the photo that I may show you, it's like the creepy stuff. All child molesters, you know, he's stealing babies when you couldn't track shit online, you know, who knows where your baby is. All right. I can just do whatever they want with your baby for a couple of days. It takes a while to get your baby over there.

Speaker 8:          02:32:59       Are you sure? Male babies wasn't spelled m a l e like you weren't looking at it? Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:33:03       Wow. That's, uh, a mail carrier with a fucking kid. That's insane. Would have stamps on it. What does it say?

Speaker 3:          02:33:11       Well, the, the tax making it illegal in 1913 it was,

Speaker 11:         02:33:14       oh, scroll back. You won't go up. Yeah, we're, it was 13 it was legal to male children with stamps attached to their clothing, children road trends to the destinations accompanied by layoff letter carriers. One newspaper reported it costs 53 cents for parents to mail their daughter to her grandparents for a family visit as new stories and photos popped up around the country. It didn't take long to get along on the books, making it illegal to send children in the mail. Wow. That's crazy.

Speaker 8:          02:33:40       They should make a illegal against keeping us postal service. Keep them in business. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:33:46       yeah, yeah. Postal Service is not doing so good anymore. Imagine if you were, you made your business on sending letters. You're like, look, the post office fucking slow. Okay, I can get a letter to your friend in a day if you have something to say to him. Just letters don't packages. I can get it to them and then all sudden the internet comes along and the email comes along. You're like, fuck my business.

Speaker 8:          02:34:05       Exactly. Imagine the guy just 15 years ago that put all his money into male. He's like, well, there's one thing that will definitely never go away. Listen, people pillar always Guinean to send letters in a timely fashion, taxes, letters, and trains. Three things that will never go away.

Speaker 1:          02:34:25       No one saw text messages coming. No one saw any of that comment. Right. The idea that you could get on your email, on your phone, your phone weighs a fucking ounce and keep it in your pocket

Speaker 8:          02:34:35       and the thing is coming in the mail is a weird, everything should be digital.

Speaker 1:          02:34:40       Well, I think that they're going to have two forms of delivery. They're going to use drones and they're going to use three d printing. I think that's what's going to be a lot of products in the future. Oh yeah. I think you're going to have some sort of a box in your house about the size of regular home computer printer. Need a bigger one for bigger things but you're just going to own like you're going to use like bitcoin to buy the directions or buy the ingredients or by the uh, the, the, the, the schematic work, whatever. You download that schematic into your, your computer press print and that fucker just develops it right there on your box. That's going to happen.

Speaker 8:          02:35:12       And the drones will have little, the, every house will have a little chimney drop where the drone just goddamn Santa Claus. Yup. Say like you left your, your iPhone at home where your phone at home, right. It's going to know your phone and said like, Hey, I need you to print. Send me my phone. So they, you would have to put it in a box because you only have one license for that phone and then it will reprint it in your, wherever you want to destroy your original, the original one because you only have one license.

Speaker 1:          02:35:35       What if it becomes like a clone? Like, remember when you get a VCR tape that somebody made off of a VCR tape and it was kind of whack and like, God, his phone's not so good. It's a clone to clone of your phone. A three d printed clone. Yeah, but it's all the data download cloud cloud.

Speaker 8:          02:35:49       Every time you drop your phone that you're like, yeah, I just need to send my phone again and get her, you know, reprinted.

Speaker 1:          02:35:53       Yeah. You just get a new phone, whatever the new one. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:35:55       Yeah man, I got to do I clone six a

Speaker 1:          02:35:58       well, you know, it'd be really dope if you could take old phones and you throw them into the computer and like dad eats him up and build a new phone. Right? Like whenever a new schematic comes up, it can actually extract and recycle the, the, the components of the device

Speaker 8:          02:36:11       car. Like every day you go, like, I want to drive today. I want to drive a Porsche tomorrow. I want to drive some, you know, whatever. Shitty, but car, your transformer, by the time we're printing out cars, we're not going to even have cars anymore. We're going to have little thing that you just get in. It looks like an egg pretty much, and you're just going to sit in it destination today. You won't even tell you. I don't even know why I'm doing that. You're already in the thing. I want to go to, uh, the roller coaster park and I'll go, do you want to go to the roller coaster park 37 miles away? Yes. And then it, you can make it so that it won't hit anything else. Good goal or has it?

Speaker 1:          02:36:49       I'll do you one better. I think we're going to transcend physical reality. That's what I think. I'm not going to, they're going to develop an artificial reality that is more complex and more rewarding than the physical reality. And so no one will exist in the physical reality anymore. It would all be even maintained from this artificial reality. We will maintain this dimension from an alternative dimension that we create and children will be born instantaneously into this alternative dimension because the fucking fear upon fears is that your kid will be born, the natural world would get eaten by animals. Fuck that. There will be no children born. We're going to figure out a way to transcend the physical reality. So whatever consciousness is when it's created, when a man and a woman have sex in a baby comes out of the woman's body, that baby will immediately be transported into an alternative dimension. As it's being born.

Speaker 11:         02:37:34       We're already in it. Maybe I saw your post the other day and bug's life thing. Yeah. I had just taken all my DVDs out and reorganize them and I had just looked at bug's life cause I lost the DVD. I don't know where it is. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:37:48       Dream about Dave Foley. I was in a onetime in bear camp. I was in bear camp and uh, I was a dream in a day. Foley was like healthy and he was like thin and Smiley. Yeah. It was like when I knew him in 1994 when I first met him on news radio and then I got up in the morning and I went upstairs and uh, uh, I sat down in front of the TV and a bug's life came on and there was Dave always voice. I was like, wow, that's weird. Cause he did that like around the same time we were doing news radio, that guy, if I feel bad about any guy getting fucked in a divorce proceeding, you want to, you want to find the worst case scenario. I mean not worst, I guess worst was Phil Hartman, his fucking wife killed him when he's sleeping.

Speaker 1:          02:38:29       But close to worst of a guy getting fucked over by a divorce, alimony laws and child support laws. Look, look up Dave Foley and look, uh, look up. Dave Foley discusses a child support and alimony from our podcasts cause it was, it was heartbreaking because they got him locked into a payment schedule based on what he was making when he was on news radio, which was a crazy amount of money. And he's on NBC. He was on a Sitcom and he was one of the big stars of it coming from kids in the hall. He was a well known comedian. They gave him this great big deal. And the show was sort of written around him and Phil Hartman. And, uh, you can't expect to make that kind of money your whole life. It's incredible. It's incredible. It's an amazing opportunity. But the idea of a sitcom is it's a once in a lifetime thing.

Speaker 1:          02:39:14       Very few people ever get one and one that goes to syndication. And what you should do is stockpile as much of that money as possible because the chances of getting another one are quite slim. But that's not how the divorce laws look at it. They look at it like, look, this is what you make. You owe x amount of percentage of that. So if all of a sudden you make, you went from $1 million a year or whatever to $100,000 a year, you still have to pay a half a million dollars a year. Like you stay, whatever the fuck it was. What did it make up enough? Wow. So he developed more than, it was more than a half a million dollars in debt that he could not pay off. I mean, I don't know what it was, but I remember at one time it was a half million. It was, it was compiling and he couldn't get into the country because if we went to the Canada they would arrest him.

Speaker 1:          02:39:55       I mean it's crazy fucking shit. He was having meetings. They were refuse to reduce the amount of money that he had to pay and it's not like a matter of like them getting money for food and money for housing and clothing, which totally makes sense. It was exorbitant amounts of money and she was flying all over the country with its money and going to foreign countries and spending all this money on redecorating the house. Like he would talk about it and would drive him crazy. It's, it's a, it's a wild because Canada doesn't let you get divorced, like as easy as you doing the United States, you have to be separated from each other at least at the time for a year. But during that year she gets access to your bank account because you have joint accounts. So during that year she would spend with impunity. I mean she would, she would try to break him.

Speaker 1:          02:40:38       She would try to break him with her spending and though he talked about it on the podcast and you see the guy was just devastated by it. Just devastated. Like that's a real extreme example. Like one of the most extreme examples. Most of the time, you know, it's like we were saying that that video earlier with that kid was getting beat up by that woman and he was doing the selfie and he's like, stop assaulting me. And then when the cops came she said that he assaulted her. Right. Thankfully he had that video. Yeah. I think in a lot of cases, like when people split up and when people get angry, people go from love to hate and in pretty extreme variation. Like people who like people who love each other. When you don't love that person anymore or that person don't, doesn't love you.

Speaker 1:          02:41:25       It's not just like you don't get along anymore. Like friends. It just, I don't hang around with them anymore. It's like they stole something from you. They stole a piece of your happiness. They stole a piece of your love and they get fucking angry and they'll make shit up. They'll say, you touched your kids. You did a bunch of creepy shit to them. You'll beat them up. They'll beat themselves up and blamed it on you. They'll hit themselves with shit and blame it on you knowing that most of the time cops are going to believe him cause guys hit women all the time. Yeah. It's scary to be stuck in them. Crazy situation like that where someone who used to get intimate with now wants to lie and plot and do anything to drag you down. You got to have him back and see if he's happier now because that really did make me feel very sad when he was here.

Speaker 1:          02:42:05       Yeah. It made me sad too. I, you know, I know he got a sitcom after that for a bit and then they did a comedy festival. Had Dave Foley just about two months ago and understand them. Was he doing on it was hilarious. It was awesome. He's a funny dude, man. Yeah. He could have been spent in doing stand up the whole time. But we had a lot of fun. He's always done a sketch, comedy Improv and stuff like that, but he could have easily been a stand up. He's a very smart guy. He's on a show now with Kin Jong and uh, Ken wants to come on the show office. I mean, we have both of them on. Oh yeah. What's the, what show was it? I don't know. I just, I've been seeing them on Facebook. Uh, they're filming. It was awesome. Oh, 10 minutes. We got to rub this picture up. Tony Motha fucking Hinchcliffe time flies by when we shoot the shit. We gotta get you on killed Tony Saying, oh, it'd be happy to, if you didn't do in the devil's ball sack k the comedy store come to a fuck. Respectable venue and a, I'll race you with my services. Of course. Bring that pitch to the ice house. I'll do it at the ice house, but I can't go back to that place. I just can't. I know too much. I know to watch Tony

Speaker 11:         02:43:12       the next Friday you have open. We'll just make it okay.

Speaker 1:          02:43:14       Yeah. Okay. Let's do it. I would love to do that. That'd be fun. And uh, if you haven't watched or listened to kill Tony, you can catch it on a desk. squad.tv. It's on iTunes and also on desk squad. Dot. TV is, um, the other one that we talk about all the time. Thunderpussy yeah, throwing to Pussy, which is a fun, fun time with the right crowd. Occasionally you get the wrong crowd and it becomes a fuck fest. But with the right crowd, the comedians go on stage and just the audience, he yells out ideas and the comedian starts to talk about things. They just re make comedy up on the spot. It's very challenging but very fun. And it's also a way that you wind up coming up with a lot of new material because you're just completely riffing as long as the audience is cool. We've had both. We've had, when the audience is awesome. And the last time it was a dog show, but yeah, that was, yeah,

Speaker 8:          02:44:01       that was fun. The last time, but those guys, there was a few people definitely that were out of control. We bought a little bit of the [inaudible] I went up first mind just so I knew it was going to get out of control cause if the three guys are bugging me I'm like oof, this is a ticking time bomb. And I tried to acknowledge them and calm them down and let them realize that they seemed wasted right from the get the few people that were just out of it. Like you're a totally, you know when people, you know audience members ways to when they're like answering rhetorical question, you know? Yeah. Like you know what drives me crazy? No, I don't know what drives you crazy, you know? It's like

Speaker 1:          02:44:35       just trying to get attention. That was a problem. It wasn't simply a matter of participating or yelling out topics they were doing were they were like trying to get attention. They were trying to be a part of the show, right? Like the guy to the left whose buddy got kicked out early and then he just kept going like, dude, your buddy's already been kicked out. Like you guys are too drunk. Like, yeah, you gotta learn how to handle your liquor sign. Yeah. Do you know how people

Speaker 11:         02:44:55       we're looking at, you know, no thing is, is that that show is also 18 and up though. Yeah. That's not cool. No, no. I don't know. They need to change that. She, yeah. Am I allowed to tech? Because I mean, I love, I love that age group, but they just, you know, if I know they're underage drinking, going on, not there, but maybe they came drunk or whatever and it adds, probably they could bring flasks. Nobody's checking their bags and they walked through the door. All these problems that we had at the last Thunderpussy, it was at the beginning of the show. So there's no way that they got drunk at the Eisenhower came in strong. So I think what's happening is people were just coming like fucking balls, wasted

Speaker 1:          02:45:30       10 year old kid that got kicked out, just like so sad. He was just sitting there on the bench outside. And I'm like, what happened dude? He's like, man, I got kicked out. I was like, look, it's not the end of the world. Got to realize like it's part of being young. You fuck up, you get drunk, do retarded shit and then you realize you did retarded shit. So the next time you think you're going to get into that same sort of situation again, you correct yourself, you'll be all right. Then we saw he was so devastated

Speaker 8:          02:45:55       at the beginning of this next Thunderpussy the one that we just did. I spent my first three minutes on that guy because I realize that if I didn't, if I didn't acknowledge him right from the get then cause Jeremiah even told me, cause he hosts it. So Jeremiah went up first, then he brought me up. Jeremiah goes, I knew I purposefully didn't double. Uh, you know, I didn't want to seem like the bad guy. I knew that you would like to take that. So I didn't even acknowledge him cause you know, Jeremiah and I worked together a lot, uh, like at the store. And just everywhere. We're both, you know, both grinders. So anyway, he knew. He knew

Speaker 11:         02:46:28       you're on Grindr. No, we don't grind each other. No. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:46:34       dog. No, it's out there on the grind, you know, that's like a rap term. Yeah. Hustling. He's hustling every day.

Speaker 8:          02:46:42       Everyday. Everyday. Everyday we bees hustling's yes. Um, but uh, yeah, so I

Speaker 3:          02:46:48       worse is that those guys think that they're helping the show. Well, that's the worst.

Speaker 8:          02:46:51       That's why if I'm first or second, I have the chance to help out the show, I go and you're not going to help the show. You might be thinking that you're, you know, I like, I've built over the years of acknowledging these people, I've built jokes on them. You know what I mean? And you're, you're gonna think you killed tomorrow at the water cooler, but you didn't, you know, you gotta just tell him the truth because if they think then that they're going to help the show, you got to nip it in the, what is it? Butter, butter.

Speaker 3:          02:47:17       Brown. The bug. It's like a plant. Nip it in the bud. Yeah. That's what you're supposed to do. Yeah. You actually pull it out by the roots. That's the best way. Nip it in the bud. What if it re rebuts true? You know, why would you plant still alive? Don't just nip it. Pull it out of the roots. Then light that thing on fire. That's what you're supposed to be, man. Imagine though, being 19 years old and getting drunk and come to a comic show where you're allowed to talk to the Comedians, you're allowed to yell out ideas. There's no four. I mean that's like part of the fun when it works out great. Yeah, but part of the problem with that is if you get the wrong kind of kids in there, especially young kids, 18 years old, hammered for the first time yelling shit out. Edibles and weed. Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't fake ids

Speaker 11:         02:48:00       by the way. Highly recommend. See Louis C K is new latest episode where as he catches his daughter's smoking marijuana. It's like an hour and a half long episode. One of the best things I've ever seen ever and Louis C K is a maniac man. Are you? Are you watching any of his shit or watching it as it was really good. I almost went to watch it like three more times in the kids. The kids that used in at the actors, Bravo to those guys. I mean it was beautiful. Wow. His daughters are amazing and they steal it a lot. All right, so great. I haven't been watching it. Do you watch game of Thrones?

Speaker 3:          02:48:31       Yeah. Don't talk about it though, is a lot of people get mad. Oh, I bet. Spoiler alert. I just caught up on a, the episode this week. Last night. Holy Fuck. Yeah. Such a good show. After it's over, you just go home.

Speaker 8:          02:48:44       Fuck. You want to watch something? Great. Watch a show on Netflix called the writer's room and just go straight to the game of Thrones episode. It's the two writers. They worked directly with George Martin. So Jordan though, they're the ones that take George his ideas and then with their imagination put it into film. It's two guys and it's been to the whole time, but they don't work together. They sit in opposite rooms. They don't even work on the same episodes. What one guy, they do one after the other, so one does one and the one does the next. And the reason why it's so great in my opinion, if you watch the this episode of the writer's room called game of Thrones, where it's these two guys, you figure out that they're just trying to outdo each other. These guys are writing partners and they're just trying to be like, I'm going to blow your mind this week, Bro.

Speaker 8:          02:49:28       Yeah, exactly. That's incredible. Yeah. Pitted them against each other. Yeah, exactly. Wow. But they're together, but they're against it. It's sort of like, like pink Floyd. If he had the, the two main guys, Roger Waters and David Gilmore with notorious, like when you hear a band breakup, like it's sort of built off of pink Floyd because they didn't play together for 20 or 30 years. The notorious huge breakup at the massive peak. And uh, but that's what they would do. Like Roger Waters, it'd be like, you know, hey buddy, a under lead creative force and I just wrote this album called the wall. It's a shame you didn't get anything in on it. And David Gilmore and be like, oh yeah, mother fucker. And he would go in a room and write comfortably numb and come back with that. But is the two biggest, you know, some of the biggest guitar Solos of all time, which is the little pin. Yeah. With his voice that David Gilmore does and says that's the same thing. Those two guys always hated each other, but they're a band and it, and it helped because Roger Waters would go check out these lyrics in this baseline, bro. And then Gilmore, it'd be like, Oh, you think you're a bad ass. We'll watch this guitar solo. He would try to steal the song from him. Wow. You know, by like laying it down or using his voice and waters was smart enough to let it all happen because that's good for business,

Speaker 3:          02:50:43       isn't it? Like every band that's ever a huge band, don't they always have a problem with the lead singer and someone else? Like even fucking van Halen. Van Halen broke up. David Lee Roth left, they brought in someone else. They brought in Sammy Hagar than they brought in that other dude. Remember that other dude who's the other dude did they brought in for, it was from a good band, but he sucked it as the lead singer of Van Halen. It just didn't work for whatever reason. Yeah. But think axel rose and guns and roses, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, they keep it together. Totally. But apparently like Keith, Richard talked a gang of shit about Mick Jagger in his book, which is Steven Tyler. It was guys Harris, but they left for a while. Right? Didn't Joe Perry leave for awhile? He did. Right? Yeah, I think so. Joe Perry is a cool motherfucker. I'm friends with him on Twitter.

Speaker 3:          02:51:29       Really cool. Joe Perry, um, he's a conspiracy theorist. He didn't a lot of conspiracy theories, man. Some wacky ones. But uh, like I found a rock at the beach and I was like, what is this rock? This is a volcanic rock and a or media or something like that. Cause it, how long has holes in it? Couldn't figure out what it was like. I remember looking at that and it was, uh, apparently fish too, that it's like a see stone. Yeah. Joe Perry told me on Twitter. I was like, what a crazy world we live in with Joe Perry can give you explanations of what kind of rock. Well, the greatest guitars ever. And he knows all about rock and knows about shock and role, knows about geology, see rocks and shit. I'm Brian. You got anything going on this weekend?
