Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Alright, here we go. Four, three, two. Hello Bill. Hi, what's going on man? I am very excited to be here. I'm excited to have you here. Excellent. The social leap. Yes. What's the social leap? I'll tell you all about it. Please do. Okay. So, um, the story that I want to tell is basically how we got here, how are we became human? And so that story begins about six or 7 million years ago when our ancestors left the rain forest. And so the question is why would they leave and how would they survive once they left? And, and that's what the social leap. So it takes a second to get it all out there. Okay. Yeah. Right. So here's the story. So if you look back about 7 million years, our ancestors and chimps, we had a common ancestor at about that point in time six or 7 million years ago, and that common ancestor, we don't know exactly what it looked like, but it was from all we can tell, it was awfully close to today's chimps and so there, if you look at chimps today, you can get a pretty good sense of what life was like then.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       And chimps today are really interesting. They're basically at the top of the food chain in the rain forest there, super fast up in the trees, super athletic, and they. Because they travel in groups, even amazing tree climbers like leopards won't try to attack them in trees. It's just they're too dangerous, too fast. But if you look at a chimp on the ground, it can't even lock. It's nice. It's kind of cute little stumbling along thing. And then the question is why would an animal that runs the show in the canopy leave the rain forest for the Savannah and then how it survived. Once I did that and that's. That's the story of this book. And then how that manifests itself to where we are today. So really my goal, I'm a psychologist, I want to understand why we are the way we are. And so in trying to figure that out, I said, well, let's take a look back all the way to our common ancestors and seed some of the key events and how they might've had an influence on how we are today.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       So the first question is why would we leave the trees right here we are, we're dominant position where we're food on the ground. Why would we ever take that risk? And the basic story there is the great African Rift Valley, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that at all, but basically it runs down from up at the Red Sea down to the coast of Mozambique. And you can think of it like a geographic zipper. You know, all the world's sits on these tectonic plates and sometimes they crash into each other like, uh, how Indians smashing into Asia and creates amylase. Sometimes they literally tear apart and Africa's tearing apart at the great African Rift Valley. So that plate that has Somalia and Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, that's moving off to the lower right, the rest of Africa is moving off to the upper left and I got no idea why it's been going on for quite a while, but one of the consequences that is that the east Africa starting to rise up slowly bit by bit and when it rises up, the rainforest dry out and so basically what you have is a situation where our ancestors were on the east side of that Rift Valley and it started to dry out and now they're in a situation where they've got this great lifestyle, their dominant position, but now they're pushed.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       They're forced out onto the ground increasingly more and more because there's more and more ground and less and less rain forest. And so how do they survive that? What do they do in order to make that work? And this is a what, what period of time is this? How many millions of years ago, six or seven, six or seven. Does this coincide with the when? When was the jump of the human brain size? We're doubling. We'll get to that. So it's a super interesting question about why that happened as well. So basically if you track us across the next 3 million years, how did our ancestors survive when they're basically chimpanzees on the open savannah and you can get a hint of how they did it because there's one chimpanzee group that does live on the Savannah in Senegal and they, they show some differences between themselves and other chimps that traveling slightly larger groups.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       They share more nicely with each other, which is interesting. That's kind of a human trait as well. And uh, they also avoid open space, like they're just kind trying to stay near the trees as much as possible. And so, and if you look at other eight, they're not aids, but other primates that are on the Savannah, Savannah, baboons, they're only monkey, so they're not as sharp as chimpanzees are, but they have a similar strategy, large groups to try to protect themselves and lots of eyes to look out for predators. And they do fine on the savannah. And so what I suspect happened is for the first few million years, basically what you've got is this chimp like animal that's kind of skirting the edges of Savannah, nowhere near the top dominant position they used to be and just kind of noodling around. And that takes, I suspect, that takes us for about the first three, three and a half million years.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       And if you look at who we are, then we're Australopithecus afarensis. So it's, if you looked at one of them, you'd think it belongs in a zoo. It looks almost like a chimpanzee. And so a chimp brain and answer the first part of your question is about 380 grams. And australopithecines brain is about 450 grams. So 3 million years of evolution and all we've got four to 70 grams. So why do we get so smart? Why do we take off in the next few million years? And what is it that Australopithecus did that, that helped us survive? And why do I call that the social late? That's all kind of tied together. And the basic story is it by this point Australopithecus has become bipedal and we can talk about how that happened, if you'd like. And so because they're bipedal, their waste is now stretched out their, um, their musculature.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Like if you look at Chimpanzee Pecs, they aim upward because of course chimps climbing all the time. I'm Australopithecus is more lateral like we are. We're basically completely lateral because things are side to side as far as we're concerned. It's harder to climb a tree, but it's a whole lot easier to do a lot of other things. And um, we have much more limber shoulder, we have much more limber wrist, all that sort of thing. And a lot of that was in place by Australopithecus. So once they became bipedal, they gained a lot of these qualities. And then the question is why do those qualities matter? Well, the, if you watch a chimpanzee throw, it's terrible at it, even though they're stronger than you and I are pound for pound by a sizable margin. When they throw their inept, they can't aim very well. And they typically use two hands because they're not lined up well to throw.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       If you watch a really good thrower, like a grid iron football player, a baseball player, or a hunter gatherer throw, you know it's a full body motion to step forward with the other leg. There's this rotation and the very last minute you bring your risks through. Well what that does is it creates an enormous amount of elastic energy across your muscles, tendons and ligaments. And the end of that throw for a human is like the snapping of a rubber band. So chimps can't do that. They're not lined up properly. But australopithecus got to the point where they could probably do that pretty well. And so now, and this purely a byproduct to bipedalism because it's stretched out their whole body and they don't, they're not climbing as much anymore. So their musculature is more lateral, which would have been helped them for throwing. So now you get to a point where they have access to the single most important military intervention in history, which is the capacity to kill it a distance.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       So if you and I are running around the savannah and lion attacks us and we got 50 of our best friends, we could kill it with our bare hands, but a lot of us are going to die in the process, right? Because you think 50 of us can get 100 that someone think even though it was with a bunch of Nice and shy and I'd be super confident where other people you wouldn't worry very much but. But even if we could. So we knew what we're doing. We're all armed with knives, whoever, whoever goes first screwed right. And so the capacity to kill the distance that will allows a larger force of weaker individuals to come to easily defeat a stronger individual. And so once they gained this capacity to throw, if they were attacked by lions or something like that, whereas in the past they just scattered for the trees.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       Now they could throw stones at it and defend themselves now. And australopithecus throwing rocks at alliant is going to be in the belly of a slightly annoyed line in about three minutes. Right? But 50 australopithecines throwing rocks at Lyons is a totally different story and so it's the. This is the idea, here is the throwing hypothesis there, what, what changed? Everything was throwing and the reason it changed everything is that it caused us. It was the first reason why we should have any effective collective action because it's not a good strategy when you're on your own. It's not a good strategy if I do it in the rest of the group hits heads for the trees, but it's a great strategy if we all do it together. And so for the first time in history, the group's goals in our history, in our line, the primate line, the group's goals aligned with the individual goals, which is let's cooperate and work together to try to drive away these predators.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       Now it, if you look at a lion and you look at someone throwing rocks, it still seems like a really big ask, right? To drive that thing away or kill it, throwing rocks. And so. But Barbara Isaac was one of the first anthropologist to propose this hypothesis quite awhile ago. Went Back and looked through the historical record and these extraordinary stories of how effective people are throwing rocks and so in, when the Portuguese went to the Canary Islands to try to subjugate it, they rock up with, you know, armor guns, uh, crossbows and this isn't the 14 something

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       and all the locals were on with, with stones and despite the fact that the Portuguese are there in army trained, you know, ready to shoot and, and in their armor they were just decimated by the local stone rock center. And the stories happened over and over again. And when you read these accounts, they're extraordinary. I can read you some examples from here. They just, the happened in Australia, it happened in the Canary Islands that happened elsewhere. They just throw rocks incredibly accurately, incredibly hard and really fast. So, and there's know accounts in Africa basically killing a zebra with one blow of Iraq to the head.

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       So like a pitcher of major league pitcher. Exactly what rock who gets very accurate at it. Yeah. So do you think they must have practiced constantly. And so what I suspect is that we evolved to like to throw rocks and so if I let you know, if I look at my son as a, for example, when he was 18 months old, we will be walking back toward that. Sophie saw a rock on the street, he pick it up and started trying to throw it. And my wife was like, no, no, don't let him throw rocks. It's only going to cause trouble. First of all I'm thinking, well maybe I'll develop a good arm so I'm going to go ahead and let him anyway. But secondly, he fricking wants to. This is something inherently fun for him, right? And I think all humans enjoy throwing and it's stunning how good you can get it with practice.

Speaker 2:          00:10:10       So, um, we were at the Ohio state fair this before my son was born and I was walking by one of these stalls where you can throw in a radar gun. And so I thought the, I was just starting to date my wife and I thought, oh, here's a perfect chance to impress her. Right? And how, how much you I am. So I said, hey, why don't I stop and I'll throw some balls here and this net, because I hadn't ever thrown. I didn't know how fast I could. So she's like, sure. And I was, I played like literally Greg. So I throw the ball and it's like 50 miles an hour and she's pretty impressed because that's sounds fast, right? Then it's like kid shows up next to me, it's got to be 12 years old, probably weighs 85 pounds. This total gangland not a muscle in his body.

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       And he just starts to fricking thrown ball after ball at like 65 miles an hour. And I'm like fuck, I mean she's not going to be impressed because it's like human twig next to me is kicking my ass. Right? And so I pick up the last ball, I fucking throw it as hard as I can, hurts my shoulder, flies off at an odd angle, doesn't hit anything, and it's like 57 miles an hour. Now, that little guy who's like literally the size of the nostril, pythagoras was thrown at 65 and hitting the target every time. And so it's obvious that it's skill, it's practice that would've made you good at this, and if your life depends on it, you're going to do it. Well. That makes sense. Coming from a martial arts background, like coordinated movement where at the end of it you snap exactly makes sense that this technique is so critical, even though you're a larger person. So better technique would have more of an impact with that. So the throwing arm, I had read this and if that was one of the hypothesis, several hypothesis, why the human brain doubled over a period of 2 million years. Another one was cooked meat, right? They figured out a way to get more nutrients out of meat that's writing over fire, right? So that's a little bit down the road. So here we are and a half million years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       And so for the first time we put some pressure on ourselves to have an advantage to be smarter. So imagine you're a zebra. You know what the hell good is it to you to be Einstein. You got what are you going to do with that brain? Right? But it's a big. It's a big cost. Our brains are 20 percent of our metabolic energy, whether we're doing math or watching tv, it's, it's constant drain. And so what our ancestors, why would they pay for that drain? Now, just recently, there was a paper that came out maybe three months ago now on um, a new brand expansion gene. They found it or they think that's what it is called notch to an l. and it turns out, I don't know, 12, 15 million years ago, there was an accidental duplication of that gene on our genome and it, but it was ineffective and it just sat there doing nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Now that's a great way that evolution works where it accidentally doubles the gene because then you don't, you can mess with it. And the old jeans still doing the job, right? So it sat there for about 9 million years in our line till about 3 million years ago, round Australopithecus. And then it duplicated itself and it came online again. And what that gene seems to do is it makes our brain remain as stem cells for longer, which means a lot more duplication before they run away. And start becoming neurons. And so if I had to guess, I'd say that that probably that gene coming online probably happened many times in the past and every time it happened in the past it was more costs than it was worth. And so what's the chimp going to do with a little bit more brain and just needs more calories and what does he gain from it?

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       But now that we're working together, now that we have collective action, all sorts of things open up, we could, we could devise division of labor, I'll say, hey man, you do this and I'll do that. Because also the [inaudible], they've got 70 more grams and a chimp. They can't do things like that, but they can all throw rocks at the same time. That's not rocket science, but all the kinds of things that came next probably were enabled by that process of us coming together and deciding to work together and cooperate. So if you look at chimpanzees, they don't cooperate very well. Um, for example, one of the activities were they sort of cooperate is when they hunt monkeys. And so the law gather around and they'll see some monkeys in the trees and they come in from every angle. It's not very coordinated. It's kind of a wild free for all.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       But what's interesting about it is that when the hunts over, let's say you just sat there the whole time and watched and I'm working my ass off chasing these monkeys, I got one. You come up and bug me for it and I don't. I don't willingly handle it. You like keep nudging me until I share, but I'm just as likely to share with you if you helped as if you didn't. I don't make any distinction. And you'll never established effective groups if you can't reward those who participate compared to those who don't. Even little kids, four year old kids. When you give them games to play and they earn stickers. If you didn't play, you don't. When you come up and ask, you don't get it. You played. Even if you didn't do your job right, but you tried, boom, you can have a sticker. So humans immediately get that, that you get rewarded for your activities as part of the group. Chimps don't seem to have that. That's fascinating because. But because chimps really do have a sense of fairness though, and that, that's one of the issues that happened with the captive chimps that attack the man who brought the birthday cake. Do you know that story? I don't know. That's too awful story. These couple,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       they kept a chimp as a pet for a long time and then as it got older it got a little violent and they had to bring it to a sanctuary and they brought it to a sanctuary and they would go to visit it and the chimp would remember them and they went to visit it and it was on his birthday. So they brought him a cake. And the other chimps in the sanctuary were furious that they didn't get the cake, uh, as well. They didn't think it was fair or they're angry. So they figured out somebody had left a gate open and they got out and tour this guy apart because he didn't give them a cake.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       Yeah. So there's the most famous example of that is actually with capital and monkeys, which aren't nearly as smart as chimps, and it's this amazing study by Sarah Bronfman and Frans de Waal, and if you want to see it in action, dwell has it on a Ted talk. It's really quite something to see. And what they do in that study is a teacher these capuchin monkeys to. They give them pebble and they teach the captions to return the pebble and they give it a cucumber slice. And so it's learning the game for cucumber slices. So if you wanted to ask, does the monkey think that's a fair reward? The answer has to be yes. Right, because it's. It's doing that for cucumber. So now you and I are. Both monkeys were in our cage. I returned the pebble, I get a cucumber. Now you return the pebble and they hand you a great capuchins.

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       Much prefer grapes over cucumbers. And so then what happens next? Well, I've been doing this behavior for cucumbers, but as soon as you get a great, I'm like, yeah, I'm not playing anymore. And you watch this tape and the cabbage in it. They give you a great, they give me the cucumber and the thing looks totally pissed. It starts pounding on the ground and throws the cucumber back or it's amazing. Yeah. Well, so the question is what does that mean? Why do they care about fairness in that way? And, and I think the answer to that question is sexual selection. And so the key to sexual selection is it doesn't matter what everybody's getting so long as I'm getting about as much as everybody else, but at the second that you're starting to get more than I have. Well then whatever females in our group, she's going to pick you before she picks me.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       And so everything is relative. We may think now, why do you care so much about what other people are doing? Why don't you just be happy with what you got? But literally the day you find out that the guy in the studio over salary's twice years, your salary sucks because it makes sense because literally she's going to choose him now before she chooses you comparison's the thief of joy. Yeah, that's exactly right. It's a. it's a really unfortunate fact because, and sometimes it matters a lot. Like for example, imagine I invented drug and I say here, take a dose in, it'll double your Iq. Instantly you're going to feel like a genius, but unbeknownst to I gave everybody two doses. You walk out of there, you're going to feel like a dumb ass because there's people saying stuff you can understand, right? So then it would matter, but the killer cases or things where where it's only just a residence. For example, there's this amazing study where they showed that people were making minimum, just above minimum wage are the ones who don't want you to raise minimum wage to the most against it real. Now, why would that be? Well, right now they've got a slight advantage over people making minimum wage. The day minimum wage gets raised now they're not any better off than anybody else. So even though they're the most likely to from it, because they

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       may lose that job, they have enough to take minimum wage. They're actually against it because it gives them a slight advantage over, you know, the guy next door. This is based on one study because I would think that the people that would be most against it will be the people that are hiring folks are at. Fair enough. It's only, it's only looking at income so the boss probably feels even the more negative of all, but if you look at people's income and their and their feelings about raising the minimum wage that people are making minimum wage wanted to go up the people one notch above do not and then as the higher you go, they do again. Really? Yeah. Wow. Up until you get to the point where you're employing people and some employers want to raise it. Right? I mean, and some don't. There's huge argument about that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       Now when it comes back to the capital and monkeys does the same effect happen whether it's a female or a male. I don't know. I mean so thing is people argue like crazy about exactly what this means. I don't think the monkeys have a sense of fairness like you and I have, but I do think they have a sense of, hold on, you're getting more than I am. I can't let this happen, otherwise I'm screwed and there's lots of great evidence that if you let that happen, you're screwed. But do the females have that same sense of competitiveness that they need to have the exact same thing, those other bitches or having to get angry? Well, here's the thing, it depends on whether you're mating system is going to be pair bonding or not, so if you're a frog or a lots of different products, not all of them are laughing tree frog or if you're a elephant seal or something, we'll all the females mate with the best male because his job is just sex and so every female can add the best one or the either in a situation where they've got no choice like the elephant seals.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       He controls the rookery or in a situation where they just listened to all the croaking and then the guard. You're the best broker, you're the dad, but if your pair bonding like humans or like lots of other animals, birds, etc. The then what you need is you've got competition on both sides. So she's always compeTing to get the best male and he's always competing to get the best female. And there's reasons why male male competition is always a bit more intense than female female competition. But both of them are there. And the more monogamous the system gets, the more both sides compete for each other. Hm, interesting. So what about in the case of like bonobo's where they're. So polyamorous and elbows are super interesting systems. So you've got lots of polyamorous animals, um, banabos or interests. Their chimps are also, you know, so if you look at, um, one of the great ways to look at our ancestors and what their lives were like because you look in your trousers and the size of your testicles tells you a lot about what sort of mating system your ancestors had.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       So gorillas have tiny little testicles and the reason that they have such tiny testicles as they use their huge body to drive away the other males and then all the females are in his harem so he doesn't need big testicles because he only needs a sperm in order to inseminate the females he's got. it doesn't take much sperm to inseminate anyone. Female and testicles are really expensive tissue to make. And if you want a pair and you land on them, you know they're uncomfortable too. Right? And so then you look at our testicles and they're quite a bit bigger than a gorillas, but they're nowhere near the size of a chimp or urbanova. Both. They're baSically in many ways almost the same beast and so although socially quite different and they have a system where they basically have to wash out the guy who was there before them. And so it takes really big testicles to have sperm competition. So their competition is. And by fighting each other, although there's a degree of that too, they know full well that when she comes into estrus, into heat, there's going to be aligned. And if you're fifth in line and you can wash everybody out before you might end up the dad wash everybody out. It was a funny way of putting it. So it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       It's a this, this testicle size is directly proportionate to the number of promiscuous females. Well, that's right. The promise acuity the mating system. And so if you look at our mating system, we clearly evolved to be largely monogamous, but not entirely. Our testicles are unnecessarily large for for an entirely monogamous species. And so we're a little bit on the wash the guy out ahead of us. There's many people to make arguments that are monogamy's socially reinforced and it's not natural. Look, if you look at hunter gatherers and and so the best, the best way that we get a sense of, well what did we evolve to do is to look at the remaining hunter gatherer societies, particularly if you look at what are called immediate return on togethers. So there are people who eat today, what they killed today. You've got a lot of hunter gatherers.

Speaker 2:          00:22:04       Once they left the equator, they could store food and everything changed for them. And they actually, in many of the behaviors, they look a lot like us and we can come back to that if you'd like, but if you look at hunter gathers around the equator there typically immediate return, kill, eat, and so those guys tend to be, tend to be, there's always, of course human differences where it's super variable species, but they tend to be serially monogamous. And so some people pair up for life, lots of people pair up for five, seven years and then break apart and pair up again. And so you have a sequence of children with the secrets of people, but, but largely monogamists not entirely. And in fact, monogamous during those time periods, largely now we know every single animal we've ever described as monogamous. When we do the dnA, we now find they're not entirely, but they're mostly.

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       Hm. Interesting. So, um, have you ever had sex at dawn? What did you think of that? Um, no offense, but I think it's total crap. Oh, chris ryan, do you hear that shit? Everybody's rocking on your book, bro. Uh, what, what did you think is crap about it? I just don't think the system works that way. The the explain to people that may or may not know what we're talking about. I haven't read that book now since it came out, so let me remind, remind me the thesis. Do you remember it off? The idea is that we evolved in these small tribes of people that essentially shared sexual partners. That's bullshit. And so the thing is that what makes you say that so confidently? well, I don't know. I shouldn't say quite so confidently. You're absolutely right. I believe that's bullshit. How's that? Okay. Why do you believe that's bullshit? Because I'm so human beings have very clear evolve jealousy systems and they're not just a product of the world that we live in today. You can see jealousy among hunter gatherers as well. Now the thing is they get jealous

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       about different things because of course men and women are slightly different pressure on them, but they both get jealous by infidelity. Now that's not to say that the book is incorrect about some societies in some places because one of the interesting things about humans is our flexibility and so you can create a system and some hunter gatherers have where there's a lot of that, a ton of that to some really interesting ones were literally once the woman gets pregnant, she then starts to sleep with all the other males because she thinks her baby will gain the qualities of all the men that she sleeps with. So I'm not trying to claim that we're always monogamous Because absolutely that's untrue. but I do think that the dominant system is one of serial monogamy. And the reason I think that that's the dominant system is this is kind of the deal that we made whereby the males go out and do the hunting.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       The females go out and do gathering. And that's basically universal. She tends to cook for him And that comes back to the fire point you made, which we can come back to. And um, and so they share resources and, and he's happy to share resources and do his best to kinda sorta look out for her kids. I mean human males aren't, we don't take as much care as human females do have our kids, but we're much better than the other great apes. And so that level of investment he's going to make his, tends to be to the degree that he believes that he's the father of the kids. Now you have societies where he doesn't know that really all are polyamorous like that by all means. I don't know what percentage they are and it could even be, they're more common than I believe, but when that happens, the systems tend to change a little bit and he's a little bit less willing to look out, try to help out kids other than to do her a favor unless the kid looks a lot like himself.

Speaker 3:          00:25:18       Now what about why having a system, a biological system where jealousy comes up? What makes you think that that somehow or another negates the idea of polyamorous relationships? Well, it does suggest that they're not our default because it doesn't more likely suggests that it encourages competition, which is just natural

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       when we think about envy instead of jealousy, and so if I'm jealous, I'm upset that my wife slept with somebody else last night. He could be a low life. I don't envy a thing about him. I don't want anything he owns, but I'm jealous of her behavior. I'm. I'm protective of what she's done and so there's a wonderful experiment. David buss has run at the university of Texas stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:26:01       They're jealous of the man as well. You're not just jealous of her behavior. You're jealous of this other male that gets to have sex with your wife and could not possibly encourage competition and encourage men to be more aggressive or more ingenious or just create encouraged creativity and courage, better hunting skills. So you attract more women. I mean, all those things seem to control. YeaH, I would agree with all that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       I phrased it a little bit differently. So there's this wonderful study out of the Philippines where they measured men's huge number of men's testosterone when they were single and then they waited a few years and measured it again after they were. They were still single or now they're married and now they're married and they have kids and I'm sure it wasn't a psychology study because we can't afford to do that. It was probably some medical thing, but they used to to answer this interesting psychological question, which what's have, who's most likely to get the girl by the original testosterone levels and what happens when you do? Well, the guys who got married in the intervening few years had higher testosterone than the guys who didn't. So yeah, you're absolutely right. we're out there competing with other males in order to get the girl and there's lots and lots of goes on there.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       Tons of really interesting things. but what's interesting is once we get the girl are testosterone drops and so if we. Once we partner up and if we're in a monogamous relationship, not polyamorous, but in a monogamous relationship, our testosterone drops and then it drops again. If we have kids and testosterone is a great hormone for getting out there and being competitive with other guys, it's not a great hormone for being nurturing for your children and it's not a great hormone for being faithful to your partner and so I think that we evolved to compete with other males in order to get into the mating game. So if you look at our ancestral dna, you know how you can track our male and female ancestry through mitochondrial dna in the mother's side and why you'll see that we have far more female ancestors than male, not quite two to one, But I think it's close to that. And so what does that tell us? Well, lots of guys are getting left out of the mating game entirely and lots of guys are inseminating, lots of different women. So all those things that you said are absolutely true and all that pushes us for competition, but part of what I believe goes on as part of that competition that we engaged in was in order to get the girl to get into that relationship in the first place.

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       Could I stop you there? Because I think that if you're going to have a study on testosterone and you have to have a study on lifestyle, I mean you, if you get married and you have children, one of the things that happens is you become less active. You'd be, you don't exercise as much, you don't sleep as much. All those things have a pretty radical effect on hormone production.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       Absolutely. And it could well be that, you know, you always have to have a proximal mechanism whereby evolution plays its game, right? So the distal cause is as, as an evolved species where testosterone is super important to get us into the mating game, but it's less useful once we're in it. Well all you could, you could, all you have to do is have a system whereby those things tend to downregulate testosterone. Exactly like you said, because you know those things are gonna happen once you get partnered up and so. But mind you, when our ancestors partnered up, they're still out hunting every day. You know, we may be right.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       You don't have Studies on. Unfortunately we don't. The issue is that I'm having with this is we have studies on the general health and testosterone and hormonal health of sedentary humans. Yeah, I mean I would like to know what their lifestyle is. I would like to know what they're doing. I'm sure that seem to make any sense to me because one thing that everybody knows is that you get dad bod, right? That's dad by what his dad bought. Dad. Bob's a guy who works all day, comes home, sits on the couch, probably eats food. You probably shouldn't eat, hangs out with his kids, doesn't get a whole lot of exercise, works, probably doesn't sleep as much as he should. That. That's to me, that's a symptom of poor health and fitness.

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       Right? And it's not a symptom or ancestors ever experienced.

Speaker 3:          00:29:48       Not. This is not necessarily an indication of any sort of evolutionary benefit of having low testosterone because we've demonstrated for sure that when people don't get sleep and when they don't get exercise, their testosterone drops. So those are two things that absolutely happen when you get married and have children.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       Right. And the only thing I would say is the times of the time span of this study was only over a few years and let's see.

Speaker 3:          00:30:12       The worst thing about having this kind of a study and making these kinds of kind of conclusions based on. I mean we see, we know these mechanisms are in place, we already know that there's natural effects of sedentary lifestyle, lack of sleep, and the effects are your hormone production drops, your body suffers, you become less healthy. And this is. This is not indicating monogamy, this is just indicating poor health. This is not like an evolutionary advantage to having low testosterone because it helps you raise children. You can have high testosterone is still be a good dad and raise children and still have friends. That theme,

Speaker 1:          00:30:50       of course, all of these things are bell curves, right? The higher you are, the harder it gets.

Speaker 3:          00:30:55       Part of the problem I'm having iS, is drawing conclusions on this one study and stating them as if they're facts.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       No, you're absolutely right. I, if I say it's a fact, it's certainly overstated because we only know the problem with almost all of our studies is the exact one you pointed out. We've got them on us. We don't have. So like the sex studies are a perfect example. Like things like female orgasm. What role does it play? Well, you need really good data on hunter gatherers to know the answer to that question. If you look at hunter gatherers, they don't have dad bod, right? They're all running and whether their fathers are not because they're out there hunting every day or gathering everyday. Very physically active. So if I, if I oversold that, my apologies. Because you're absolutely right. I suspect though that you'd find the same thing. I don't know it. It's all we got right now, but how can you suspect it? I mean it just, there's no data, there's no data. It just, when you look

Speaker 3:          00:31:42       these guys, I have a friend of mine who he was, was it, how'd you say the name? The yanomami in Bolivia. Bolivia. Whether in Venezuela, Brazil. Yeah. And he spent some time with them and you see these people and the lifestyle they live, they're all barefoot wandering through the jungle. They have these crazy looking feet, whether their toes splay out because they're just constantly gripping the floor with their toes when they probably could choke you with me, you know, and these people just look so fit and healthy in their, in their fifties and sixties and seventies. And they have their shirt off and they're ripped.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       Yeah, they're super fit. Same holds. If you look at the hubs in Tanzania, any of these groups, the yanomamo are interesting because they're a hunter horticulturalist, so they're actually doing a little bit of gardening as well. But they're ripped and strong and they don't have obesity problem. And so all I would say is That the same thing holds. The one thing that we found in humans in our modern culture where we have these data is if you're married and have kids, but you're still looking, your tea hasn't gone down as much that you're going to point out quite rightly that well maybe that's a different kind of person than the person who marries and isn't looking around, and so it's all confounded, super hard to do experiments on these things and we'll be a lot better off when we've got, as you know, we're losing the world's last hunter.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       Gatherers are disappearing and it's not easy to collect these kinds of data, but they're doing lots of genetic work with these people right now all over africa because you know, there's. We've got tons of genetic data now on european descent and east asian descent, but almost none on africans and so that's a huge project underway and so for all I know, they're working on hormones and other things as well. Yeah. That's the reason why I'm asking about this is you. You were so readily dismissing. You were so willing to dismiss that, but yeah. Well, the. A lot of the facts that are laid out as facts in the book don't really hold up and I'm in. I wish I'd read it more recently and so I could go through the details with you. There's some really good reviews by anthropologists and by people who work in, you know, sexual studies and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       Going through the details. We read it as a, we haven't this evolutionary center center for psychology and evolution and we read it and went through it and we weren't convinced. I'm embarrassed to admit I can't remember the details of. Chris is a very smart guy and he's a good friend of mine. also a great book. It is a great book. I would love to see him debate one of those folks. I'm sure he probably has. He probably has. And look, I know that all these things that we're talking about are heavily debated, right? So. So my colleague rob brooks is a wonderful evolutionary biologists and Australia loves that book. So the fact that I think it's bullshit is obviously one person's opinion. Where I. I dismissed that argument. Other people might say, well look, there's a lot of cultures that they do have much more like the system I told you about where they have sex with lots of men after they have their baby.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       Humans are so flexible, we can do all those things. we just changed the nature of how we do things. The social leap that I'm arguing about is not this pair bonding thing. It's about how our groups came together to engage in collective action. so in principle, I'm agnostic on this issue. I just happen to disagree with that. I happen to feel like no, I think we made these deals. And so to come back to the study, the david buss did that I started to tell you about. So bas has this, um, he's got, when he came along, people thought that the two sexes had similar levels of jealousy for infidelity. And david was like, well, looks inseminations internal. And so men should be a lot more worried about her sleeping with somebody else than women should be because he. Men never know for sure if they're the father, they can't see it happen.

Speaker 1:          00:35:10       Whereas, you know, if you're a salmon, you can say, okay, I'm the debt, I just watched that, but um, females inseminations turn, but they know they're the mother. That's not their concern. They should be more concerned about things like his given her resources to help her raise the kids and things like that. And so what bus found is if you ask people this question, what would bother you more? Imagine your wife having sex with somebody that she just met for the first time, having this great time and doing all these different things with them and then never doing it again. Or your wife develops this, you know, ongoing, emotional connection with somebody. She never touched him. He never touches her, but they talk and have shared their feelings and stared deep in each other's eyes. What would bother you more? And you ask men and women that question. So what would, in your case, what would bother you to have your wife to know? She had this one off a fair fling. Sex only didn't care about the guy or she develops a sort of emotional bond with somebody. Never touches it.

Speaker 4:          00:36:05       That's a good question. I'd really have to think about that. It's not an easy one because nobody likes either of them. No. Yeah, because it's a matter of time for that dude gets in. That's a no. The guarantee in this case is the guarantee. It's a guarantee that they never, never touched. Never. As long as he doesn't talk shit about me. That's the problem. Those guys, they started the pool. I would do so much better. Right? Well, here's the thing. Weasels, on average, men are more bothered by sex. The one off sex and women are more bothered by the emotional, emotional connection because connection could lead to him leaving her.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       Well also, if it's him leaving her directing his resources elsewhere, so it's, it's mind you, every time we talk about gender differences is super important to keep in mind. They're heavily overlapping bell curves, so it's never 100 percent this way and except like do you have this Oregon or something? But psychologically it's always overlapping, but on this is a big effect. Men on average are much more bothered by the one off sex and women on average are much more

Speaker 4:          00:37:07       bothered by the emotional connection. Yeah, that's fascinating because I was reading something about inappropriate emotional relationships that people have at work and that this is an issue with people that work together. They develop these office friendships that lead to inappropriate emotional relationships and I was like, whoa, this is a, you know, I've never worked in an office so I'm listening to this or reading this rather. And I'm like, what a strange world that is. Like, I get it though. I get it. Like if there's a guy and he's married and a gal and she's married, but they meet at work and they stare in each other's eyes all day and they go to lunch and maybe they even hold hands every now and then. Well, they become. That's where it crosses the line. Like you're allowed to hug people when you hold hands. That's fucking. That's tense. That skin to skin.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       It is serious. It's going to concern you if you're a partner, but what's also going to concern you as a mere fact that you see this kind of thing, this deep conversation happening and all that, because think about it. If we evolve to basically partner up for awhile, then there's always going to be the chance that that next person long it's gonna be the one which is years away serial monogamy and both males and females gain from not putting all their eggs into the same genetic basket. So if my. If my wife partners up with you for awhile, she'll get a certain kind of offspring and then maybe that'll be a great thing, but maybe when the situation changes or the in tomorrow's world, some smaller guy would be handy

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       in some way and so maybe she's better off partnering with me next. Interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       Yeah. It is fascinating when you break it down that it really does become. There's a biological reason for these behaviors and these are the motivation for the jealousy and all these things that there's. There's a history of biological history to all this

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       stuff and we don't know what hunter gathers how they would answer that question so we can only just assuming that the answer we're providing is general, but for me, those kinds of things suggests that we evolved. We evolved in a lot of longterm monogamous circumstances that may have been serial and there was certainly fooling around, but if we were polyamorous, like the book says we'd have bigger balls. Are balls are so big though, compared to a chimp there. Small. Yeah. But chimps are. I mean, everything's big with them. Well, no. Our penis is way bigger than theirs. They got a tiny little. They have large. Paul's smaller penises. Puppets would probably get in the way. Right. When though. Here's the thing about, so human beings copulate for an extraordinarily long period of time and we also have this cryptic ovulation, you know, where she's not showing you that she's in heat, so mail chimp's aren't interested unless she has an enormous swelling on her vagina and then they're like, oh, that's super attractive to me.

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       Oh, I say, but what about banabos? Because they, well, they do this funky sex thing all the time. Right? Have fun, right? Yeah. They're all sorts of funky orgiastic kinds of things. We used, there's a, when I taught at Ohio state university that the zoo there has a great exhibit and you bring your kids through and there's a series orgy going on and the kids are like, came out and she said, yeah, there's a lot of zoos that won't happen. Novos, because they're pretty interesting. And so the thing is that those kinds of things just show you that it's complicated, right? Any kind of straightforward answer that it's going to have some wrinkles. Yes. Yeah. And I apologize if I get some earlier. No worries. And so anyway, the um, the but back to this issue. So if we had a total bonobo, chimp kind of system, I don't think we had evolved those systems of jealousy because what's, what's to be gained by that we're not making these longterm partners. Why would you get these differences? again, whenever I bring chris's book up, I have to defend it because it has happened a couple times in the last year. I haven't read it and at least two years I'd have to go back and I read it back over five years ago, but someone who came out,

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       when my friend's wife got ahold of it, my friend got it and my friend's wife got all of it

Speaker 2:          00:41:01       to a right in the trash. She read like a paragraph or two and she was like, fuck this book. A lot of women react that way and I can't remember why. Yeah, sorry, I just don't have it loaded up.

Speaker 3:          00:41:13       Whatever. Um, so when these chimp, like creatures from millions of years ago, slowly started walking upright and started moving into the grasslands and making, making experiments and traveling away from the jungle. And this coincided the development of the throwing arm and this could because they started walking upright. When did this, when did the cooked meat

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       come along? So they don't control fire. so also can't do that. So now we go forward. We're now about three and a half million yearS ago. You got to now go forward to about a little less than 2 million years ago to get to homo erectus. So once we get to homo erectus, we now got an, uh, an ancestor that literally, if it went to the z, you'd say, well that's a kind of rough hewn guy, but you think it's a person and not somebody who bought belongs behind the glass. So, so a chimp brain is three 80 australopithecus for 50 and homoerectus nine slash 60. Whoa. So you got doubling. A brain says, no, mind you. It's a bigger being. So it's not as quite as big dramatic of a change as you think. But along with that comes all sorts of capabilities. Now you write about this book catching fire.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       Richard wrangham argued that what enabled that? So if you look at the gut of a gorilla or a chimpanzee in their brain, they got a lot of guts for a little bit of brain because it takes a lot of digestion to keep a little bit of brain going. We have a tiny gut for a huge brain and rang a argues, and I think quite rightly, that the only way you can achieve that is by releasing more nutrients from your food. And the only way you can release more nutrients from your food is by cooking it. So when he made that argument, he thinks it goes back to the beginning of homo erectus. And I suspect he's right at this point. When he made the argument, we. It was only back to, I don't remember half a million years, 350,000. It's already back to a million years ago. We found in caves in South Africa, evidence of control of fire. and so it'll probably keep getting pushed back because you know that crap. It's hard to find. So this was a half million years, so now it's back to a million millionaires. And he made that prediction when it wasn't even that far back

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       in a million years ago, even though they're not technically not homeless.

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       No, we're still at home erectus. And so they started a one point nine or so, one point 7 million years ago. And one point nine, I think. And what homo erectus could now do. So now remember what the argument is, this social leap, it's this collective action that not only protects us on the savanna but sets us on this new pathway. It creates this new niche. It's this cognitive niche, although I think of it as a social cognitive niche because it's the working together that gives you all these potential advantages to getting smarter and so now when that gene sitting in our head, if it kicks into gear those and starts to work and it leads to cranial expansion, those animals will have and will have an advantage because they can coordinate with each other better and so they can remember, hey man, you helped me out last time but you weren't.

Speaker 1:          00:44:01       So yeah, couldn't count on you. So I'm avoiding you and I'm sticking with you. They can do a lot of things with that brainpower and by the time you get to homo erectus and the brain power is doubled. We see all sorts of super interesting things. So before homo erectus, when you look at our tools, it's called an older one tool and it's basically a barely sharpened rock and you never find an older one tool to very far away from wherever it was quarried and made like, you know, you look at the rock and the chips and not far away is where it's lying on the ground. Homo erectus made a much nicer tool. It's bi-facial.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       It took a lot of energy to make it. When we teach modern anthropologists or grad students or whatever to make them and you put them in an mri magnet where it can measure your metabolism and your brain is you go, you see that it takes a lot of frontal lobe functioning in order to make one because it's a lot of planning. how am I going to hit it next to make this thing just right compared to an older one tool to make those doesn't take much frontal functioning. Just racket there and it'll be sharp. And so the first of all, we know homo erectus invented that tool, this, this assurion tool with his bi-facial handhelds. and second of all, and one of my, one of the coolest findings, there's some interesting work in a one point 2 million year old site in India, uh, by carrie sHipped and where he finds that the production of these tools is separated spatially about the place.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       So the first step is bashing loose a big piece of rock and that's done here. And then 10 meters over there, somebody doing the initial chipping on it and 10 meters over there, somebody sharpening up the final touches. Now, if you were making it by yourself, why would you systematically walk around the site as you made it? You almost assuredly wouldn't. But if you've got division of labor, you're the big strong guy, you do the first thing, then you hand it to me and I do the finer sharpening. It makes sense that it would be spatially distributed about the site. So there's that evidence for division of labor. There's the evidence that they're bringing down some pretty fast animals like horses and potentially even bringing down elephants, which in those days are like twice the size of an elephant and then they using spirits at that point we don't know because they didn't survive.

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       Right. And nothing would is still around. There's no sign of hafting anything. So if it was beers it would have been a wooden point. so I think what they could meaning the end of it like cut in half. so you could stick an ear tip. exactly. And then exactly strapping it on or any of a variety of were put. Yeah. And so they. There was no sign of that yet, but there's no reason why they couldn't have a sharpened spirit. In fact, we know that. Remember the, I mentioned the chimps in Senegal that live on the savannah. They're the only chimps on earth who do this. They'll bite the stick to sharpen it and poke them monkeys to when they're in the hollow of a tree and stab up. Did you see that recent discovery and I'm in. It's really recently. There was an article I read one or two days ago at about orangutans when they gave them wire.

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       They use the wire to fashion and into fishhooks. Now I didn't. That's totally cool. They figured out how to make a fishhook independently and that's amazing. You've seen them like spearfish, right? Hangover, tornadoes that. That's that. That picture is actually of an orangutan who's watched fishermen do this. He couldn't do It. Remember an orangutan, if it meant you could literally pull your arms off like that. The enormous strength, particular gearing for that strength. They got very poor motor control like you and I can type. They can't do that. Right. And so that, that orangutan, that famous photo never could catch anything, seen it done and it was trying to see if he could do it too. Fair enough. He's trying to use a timer but. But you know, there's these corporate, these crows and such dell fashioned hooks to. Yeah. So there's some, there's a lot of amazing evidence for this sort of animal ingenuity and making tools will.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       You've seen the studies with crows were they use one stick to get a larger study to get a larger food? Amazing. Now the one thing is we don't. They can do that and then they fail some super simple tests so it could be that their brains tiny though they are dedicated to a particular way of solving a particular problem because it's especially these ones that live in new caledonia do this in the wild and so they they fashioned amount of palm fronds, they tear it off and they reshape it and then they hook insects out of the bark of trees and stuff. And so you could imagine that they've kind oF learned a specific way of problem solving, but they can't do something that to you because you would solve that using some pretty domain general mechanisms to you looks the same. But to them it's totally different.

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       Did you find a thing with the ringtones? It's really crazy. It's just a. Well, you know, I'd read something. Here we go rank 10 spontaneously. Ben straight wires into hooks to fish for food, which is amazing. Is they have a photo of a jamie if you scroll down a little bit there, but does that photo. It's just. I'll just him with a stick. yeah, that's really, really cool. I had read something a few years back that said that they were agreeing that chimpanzees had officially moved into the stone age.

Speaker 2:          00:48:42       Yeah, so chimpanzees were used stones as tools, so they'll crack nuts with them, but they've never. They've never been shown to modify stone tiles and so if you want to say the stone age, doosan stones, by all means, if you want to say it's modifying stones. The the oldest evidence that we have potentially modified is three point 3 million years ago. These lamech we tools, but there's argument about how legit those right.

Speaker 3:          00:49:04       There's argument about a lot of those sites too where they believe that they find stone tools that are ancient because it could easily just spend shale.

Speaker 2:          00:49:11       Yeah. And overwatch. It's super complicated to know exactly when it got laid down, everyone. So I'll get lucky and the and the layers are super orderly and then when you get to that layer, you know exactly what you got, but now what's the chances of finding what you're after there? Right now when they say the stone age, that's what they mean. Just the idea of consciously using a rock to like smash open a clam or something like that. Yeah, I mean, to me that does. I, I gotta I gotta admit I'm not quite sure technically what an anthropologist would mean when they say stone age, but um, to what, what we know is that chimps will do that. They'll use rocks to, they'll even, if they're clever enough to have an anvil basically like her hammer ball based on put a rock on it, smash what?

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       They're not clever enough to do. So chimps have partial theory of mind and theory of mind is this idea that I know that the contents of your mind differ from the contents of mine. And all humans get there when they're little around age four. And so the. And you can see the penny drop because they just assume everybody knows the same things and everybody's the same preferences and, and that's why when they're really little, their stories can be hard to follow because they assume what's in your head is the same as theirs. They assume you liked the same things. And actually it turns out that the ones who have siblings learn it earlier because like, oh you like the red jellybeans. I like the green ones. Awesome. This is a beneficial deal for both of us, right? Right. Anyway, can get partial theory of mind so I could see what you could say.

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       I know what you could see at your angle of how much chimp and I know that might differ from what I could see, but they can't get to the point of knowing that you could represent beliefs that aren't true, that you could have deeply, etc. Or that maybe I don't like bananas, but he does like, but then they can't really get there. And so what the problem is without theory of mind, how do you teach somebody? Because if I just assume you know what I know, then when you're doing a crappy job breaking the net, I'm like, what's wrong with joe here? And so chip mothers take years to to teach their offspring, to break these nuts open 10 years on average, because first of all, they don't get a chance to do it very often. Then that's got to be in season. Second of all, it's easy to bReak your fingers and that kind of slows you down.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       But third of all, they'll occasionally make some very specific corrections when the, when the offspring is doing it wrong, but they don't know what the problem is because they don't know what the kid doesn't know. And so when you don't know that you can't teach. And that's why humans are stunningly effective teachers. That's fascinating. So chimps learn more just by observing. Yeah, and what's amazing about the way chimps observed is that because we have theory of mind, we also do imitate differently. So there's this amazing experiment by andy white and his colleagues and what they did is they created this treasure box. And so inside this treasure box, there is something that a chimp or a kid wants, like a little piece of food and in one condition the box is totally opaque so you can't see how it works and they'll poke at the top of it and then the poke in the middle and it pops open and then they give it to the chimp, close it up.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       Chimp does the exact same thing. Poke, poke, poke, poke, pops open, give it to a kid, does the exact same thing. Now they do the, they do the replicate that same experiment, but instead of having that box be opaque, it's translucent and you can see well and truly the poking the top does nothing. The latch is actually right here and so that initial poke was a waste of your time. This second one actually is one that opened the box up when when chimps watch that, they skip the first one and they just opened the box. Kids despite being smarter than a chimp poke at the top first and then they poke it in the bottom and we call this over imitation. They're imitating clearly irrelevant actions. Now, why would anybody imitate clearly irrelevant actions? WhAt advantage would it give you? Well, if you have theory of mind, you say, well that's joe's box.

Speaker 2:          00:52:42       He knows something about it. There may be a reason why I can't see, but then maybe reason why he's poking at the top first, and so I better do everything that he does. I better have the highest fidelity copying that I possibly can because it may be valuable. And what you end up with is these systems around the world where people eat these amazing foods that you think you know, how on earth could they ever figured that out? Well, it was probably developed step by step and everybody's always got this super high fidelity imitation because they're over imitating. So my favorite examples in new Guinea, they, the sago palm, I'm not sure if you've ever seen a sago palm, but it does not look like an edible tree. It just looks like a free country. Right? And it turns out that if you, you chop the tree down, take the bark off, take like an ads or something similar, grind up the sawdust, have all that sawdust.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       you then wash it off in warm water because of course all the water in new Guinea will be nice and warm, and that causes. It's a super high starch tree that causes the starch molecules to separate from the sawdust because at that point it's inevitable. So then they have these cloth and the starch molecules pass through the cloth, the sawdust one. Now they collect this cloudy water. They put in these traditional canoes, they let it sit overnight and all of the starts sinks to the bottom. Then they pour the water off the top and now they've got this flower. But you have to dry it out in the sun really faster. It becomes toxic. So it's like this nine step process that who on earth could ever come up with it, right? But once it's in place, once they slowly figured it out to make it work, everybody just does it the same way because even though they don't know, they may understand it, but they don't need to. They just know this is how we do.

Speaker 3:          00:54:09       Well, that's like that. What is that root that they cassava? Yeah. That if you don't cook it correctly, it's literally cyanide and they have water from and they have to take that water and they have the buckets of these water, the water for that they're using to create this stuff and they just leave it laying around and kids are playing around it and the pigs and animals around it. And if they drank it, they'd be dead.

Speaker 2:          00:54:35       Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. The detoxing of cassava. Unfortunate I'm not. I'm not familiar with that. But there's a lot of those examples and you're also right that in those kinds of societies, they're super relaxed about things that we strike the strike.

Speaker 3:          00:54:46       Kill you quote. Exactly. But that's tough. it. It becomes cyanide, right? You could be right. I don't know that one. See if you could find this because it's on an episode of that same show. It's this show is called meat eater. It's my friend steve who went and spent some time with them down in the jungle south America. It's really interesting stuff. Just seeing how these people function and and they have this big vat and they're cooking this stuff and he was explaining like right now if you hate it, you're dead. You got to wait a while and like, how the fuck did they figure this out? Researchers to get to the sinai. Oh, cyanide producing abilities because I was the third most important food source in tropical countries, but as one major problem, the roots and the leaves of poorly processed cassava plants contain a substance that when eaten can trigger the production of cyanide, kills the shit out of you. But it's weird that that thing is like a major staple in their diet.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Well, this is a really good example of a, the value of human learning and this over invitation process, right? Because the first guy where they go, okay, I'm not going to do that. Right? And then this person aided unaided successful. Let's take a look at what they did. So I remember when I was a kid, I was turned to learn to play baseball and pitch the ball and the person raises their knee almost up to their nipples. And I'm like, that's the most awkward pitching motion I've ever seen. But I didn't occur to me. I'm not going to do that. Right? It occurred me. Well, there must be a reason to do that. So, um, what can I do to try to emulate that motion? Right? Right. The whole, the whole nine yards. There's a purpose for every one of those pieces. And as humans we're saying, well, you're teaching me how you've got to have a reason for doing that. And that's the huge between us and everybody

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       else. Nobody else can do that theory of mind thing to make that assumption. And that's why the chimps skip that step that they, that they know at least in that particular tournament is really actually useless and kids don't. So

Speaker 3:          00:56:35       you're a concept is that as these animals that used to be monkeys start evolving and trying out new things, one thing that they learn as they enter into this new climate as if there's a massive benefit to.

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       Yes. Now I would say it's not monkeys because technically speaking aren't all apes monkeys, but not all monkeys or apes? No. So a monkeys and apes are different. They split off a month.

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       He's not a real word. I mean it's not a word in terms of scientific designation,

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       right? Even the monkey of two different things. Right? But there's. There's old world monkeys in new world monkeys, but all of them have a genus and species that. But it's not a scientific name, right? There's a key's not now they're primates. They're all privates. What did I read? The cv? Google that google. There was a whole

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       bullet. Anthropologist wrote that. Not all apes or monkeys, but all monkey. No, not all monkeys or apes, but all apes or monkeys because monkeys almost a slang term

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       because it's bullshit. I think it's bullshit, but we'll find out that what I would say is it all apes and monkeys are primates and they all started from monkey ancestry. Right, right. And so. But then the ape split off. You've got to rang content. The great apes are orangutans, gorillas, chimps and us, and then you got gibbons which are lesser apes, which split off quite a while ago and they're very different. They don't have the brain power of the great apes.

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       Do you find anything like that? I read this a few years ago. Was it confused the shit out of me because I didn't know that monkey wasn't a scientific term.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       Well, scientists talk about old world monkeys in new world, but it's almost a slang term as well. Whenever you're. If you're. If you're a prepper biologist and you have the species and say that was a chimpanzee is thing I found. Is it like pen light source, but it pops up

Speaker 3:          00:58:20       on google. Okay. Comes up, but it's a longer. It's there's more to it. Apes or monkeys in the same way that monkeys are primates. Humans are apes and I am a human. It's called the nested hierarchy. That's right. It means that all apes or monkeys, but not all monkeys or apes, just as all humans are. Abe's, but not all apes are humans. Okay. Yeah. Zygoma per click on that link. They get someone's website at. Yeah. This is what I read. Now, is this a. Is this a bullshit article? I don't know. Sorry. Apes or monkeys deal with it. That's another term. I don't know the origin of the term. Mark martin robbins wrote a fun piece to the lay scientists the other day, the incorrect term. These monkeys described apes. It triggered an article by graham smith for the daily mail. In martin's words, a great crime against entry is in progress and it's time for someone to draw a line. So as a parent, how do yoU say that pen

Speaker 1:          00:59:13       today? Antic. Yeah, but I never stood by itself,

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       uh, with a professional interest in the issue. I'm taking my stand to help ensure the, that a miscarriage of pedantic

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       justice doesn't occur. That guy likes that word. Um, nested hierarchies. Apes or monkeys in the same way that monkeys are primates. Humans are abe's. And I'm a human, it's called a nested hierarchy and he has a primate nested hierarchy setup. Could be right. I just don't know. I don't know the origin of the term, but he cares and he cares enough to put that up. Yeah, he fucked my head up. Just dude. You could be right or not right. He's, if anybody's right, he's right or you're right. No, no knowledge. But all I mean is that. So the ancestors who moved to the savannah weren't monkeys like baboon monkeys, chimp, ancient chimp. And so once we get tome erectus, they're Basically like us, although there are brains there around nine 60 were around 13, 15 and we literally have a chimp brain added on top of there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       So There's a big difference and you're absolutely right. It's accelerating like crazy. And I am totally convinced. Well I believe rang gms, right? I mean we don't know for sure of course, but I believe he's right, that it was fired. They played a huge role in that. And so what you got is this process, where are our evolution facilitates a further evolution, right? So you get the cognitive capacities to control fire and now that allows you to grow your brain even larger. Because we can, we can store fat, we can get more nutrients from the food we eat, we can detoxify other things. Fire super valuable. Even chimps will eat if they go through a area where there's a forest fire and you know, speaking to what's going on locally, they'll eat like the roasted nuts first. They really liked that because I mean, you know, just you go in your kitchen, you smell a raw steak.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       It's like palatable. You smell it when it's cooking. It's delicious or that is interesting, right? That's us. No salt or anything on our nose telling us that is a great source of food and nutrients. That's not so much. That is interesting. I've never thought about it that way, but yeah, there's a tremendous difference in the way your body reacts to it and it's not just based on your experience eating it. It just smells amazing. It smells amazing and so random talks about. he argues that you can't live on a diet of raw food unless you're reading these super fruits and stuff like that, that basically we've horticulture into existence because raw food just doesn't give you enough calories. So the example that he uses, which is a great one, is chimps literally spent something like six to eight hours a day chewing just to soften up the food enough so that they can swallow it and digest it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       You know, if sushi you're hardly, you know, some of the things that we cooked and that's all in that case, but you know, cooked steak, I really nice one. You barely chew it at all. It's just down the hatch. It goes. So that's a great argument for gorillas as well, right? Because gorillas are just eating roots, fucking celery and so literally they have a humongous got right constantly chewing in order to me and they've got a huge, the sagittal crest right here with the bone so that the muscles attached to it so they can chew hard enough to get through all that stuff and make a digestible and still there. God is enormous. Yeah, that is interesting. The chimps have those enormous chewing muscles on their head and so we lost. That's another example where somebody along the way last, I can't remember what that gene was, where our muscles weakened in our jaw and that would have been a year. That would have been a death knell if you're back cooking, right

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       post cooking. All that does is free up space for get rid of some unnecessary muscle, free up morris cranio space for brains, the inside, not the outside, so is it likely that there was a bunch of different factors that there was natural selection in play and that there was also the the throwing arm and then also cooking and also this, this cooperative effort that led to people being a little bit more ingenious, a little bit smarter and how they hunted and how they tried to get food and then how they protected their fire, how they cultivated fire, and that all these things lead to more clever behavior which led to a natural selection of clever, more clever champs with larger brains are apes rather with larger brains? Absolutely, and so anytime you got something major happening, it probably doesn't have a single cause, it probably has lots and lots of causes and so in this case all these kinds of factors came together.

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       Now if you're standing at the outset and you're playing god and saying, well, let's see what happens when I dry out the rain forest, I think nine times out of 10 the chimps all end up dead, right? But somehow we got really lucky and they went down this very particular road and once they got their social act together and they started cooperating, chimps are never going to be very effective in groups because they can't get along. They can cooperate very well, but, but once these animals probably had us fill a pivot, gus, but maybe not till later. Of course we don't know all we can look at what they were capable of, but it fits the storyline that they would have been the ones who develop that. Once that happened, social becomes everything. So we tend to think about what are the challenges of physical life like sago palm.

Speaker 2:          01:03:53       You move into that territory and you got to configure that out. It seems enormously complicated, but you have to remember that before modern travel was invented, everybody walked everywhere which meant you spent your entire life basically in territory that you're familiar with or the kinds of animals that lived there, the kinds of problems that you face and so cognitively the terrain is not really a challenge for you and how to even making food in those really complicated ways is not a challenge for you. Once you got theory of mind and you can learn how to do it, but what is a huge challenge for you is the social interactions with each other. Because as my group gets smarter, if I'm not smarter for sole member, we talked about sexual selection. I'm not going to get picked. I'll get left behind. Second of all, we live in a world where there's no law enforcement, and so the day that you decide that I'm more troubled than I'm worth, I'd go to sleep on.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       I never wake up again, and so I have to be able to manage some very complicated relationships. It's a little bit in my mind, it's like every morning when you wake up, it's to an episode of the sopranos. How are you going to find a way to get through your day without getting whacked? Right? And if you can't figure it out, that's the end of your life. Have you ever read any terence mckenna? I know you're familiar with something called the stoned ape theory. No, sorry, not mckenna. It was, uh, he was, uh, an ethnobotanist and he was also a psychedelic adventure and he had a theory. And the theory was that the, what you're talking about, this climate change that also coincided with a doubling of the human brain size. His theory was that one of the things that was

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       in play was that these apes would experiment with different food sources as they moved into the grasslands and there was a lot of undulates and these grasslands and it siliciden mushrooms, which we know existed back then would grow in these grasslands and that these monkeys, apes rather started consuming siliciden mushrooms and it led them to be more creative. And it also led to specific traits like the development of language that eating mushrooms in low doses increases visual acuity, which would lead them to be better. Hunters are more perceptive. It also leads them to be hornier, which would most likely involve more breeding, more sexual activity, and possibly select the ones that chose the mushrooms would maybe possibly breed more than the ones that didn't choose the mushrooms because they were more into it. And then we're more social, more sexually active. And he has a series of, uh, like his brother dennis, who's still alive, detailed it on a podcast we did the very first podcast we did in his brother is an, as is an actual scientist. And detailed it in terms of how silicide affects the brain and what areas of the brain it, what, what, what actually takes place when you're under the influence of this and that it could very potentially have led to the development of language and that this, all these things in play, the throwing arm, the developing these new social networks, uh, where you need to communicate with each other along with the harnessing of fire along with the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms on a regular basis because they were incredibly frequent and very admirable.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       Right? That's total trip. I've never heard of that. Fascinating. It would be really like, that's a really good example of some random thing if it really did play that role, how random that is, that these freaking things happen to be growing there and that they happen to be attracted to them and ate them. We know that animals like to get high. I'm elephants will eat these fruits that have well the drunk in this case, overripe and, and have become alcoholic. We know that animals will do that.

Speaker 3:          01:07:29       you've seen jaguars that consumed psychedelic plants and they rely on their back and stare at the sky and no. Oh, it's amazing. But you know what iowasca is? No. Iowasca is a, it's a way that, uh, these people in the rain forest develop untold thousands of years ago of developing an orally active version of dimethyltryptamine. Do you know what their mental tryptamine dimethyltryptamine is? The most potent psychedelic known to man. It's incredibly potent drug that is just intensely hallucinatory. Gives you these insane visions. And it also is this. Here's a jaguar. It's really crazy. And this is in the amazon. These jaguars eat these plants and plants are the, they have the ingredients of iowasca and these jaguars are known to eat these things and then trip her fucking balls off. they eat them and there are pupils dilate and they roll over on their back and stare at the sky.

Speaker 3:          01:08:29       I mean, they're clearly high. So this is something that you're going to say, yeah, this is what I'm gonna say. So this is what iowasca is, is dimethyltryptamine look kind of cool watching this jaguar trip balls. They just stare. They see shit that's not there, I mean, or it is. They're still traveling. It's amazing. So what iowasca is is w, there's dimethyltryptamine, which is this incredibly potent psychedelic drug is produced in the human body. It's produced by the liver. It's produced by the lungs, and they also believe it's produced by the pineal gland, which is literally your third eye, the pineal gland in certain reptiles actually as a rep, a retina in a lens. I mean it's like an eyeball and they think that the egyptians called it the seed of the soul and they think that this is one of the reasons why they have this obsession with this gland in eastern mysticism is somehow or another, they figured out that this is the gland that produces this incredibly potent psychedelic truck.

Speaker 3:          01:09:29       This psychedelic drug dimethyltryptAmine also exists in thousands of different plants. The problem is when you consume it orally, your body produces something in your gut called monoamine oxidase, and monoamine oxidase breaks it down. So what these indigenous people figured out is how to combine one plant which contains this psychedelic compound with another plant which contains a natural mao inhibitor called harming. So they brew this all together, much like they did the cassava, which we have no idea how they figured that out. They bring this stuff up together and they create this psychedelic t called iowasca and iowasca. Now they have all these trips where people go down to Peru and take this stuff and trip to fucking balls off. And this, uh, this, the combination of these things leads to this incredibly potent trench, really transformative experience, which is impossible to describe and that this, this psychedelic drug. Why? Why did I bring that up?

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       Was what we were talking about how maybe chimps and are these early ancestors did something similar which pushed them along this path that starting to communicate. How did I get it?

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       Wow. How did I get the iowaSca? There are a couple of links in that chain is because of animals that get high. That's, that's what it was. So this is what this. That's exactly what it was. It was, yeah. The jaguar getting high on dmt, that's what they think. The jaguar, it's the jaguar consuming this stuff. It's making them trip on dmt. Dmt is. I mean it's fun. it's really exciting. And so that's.

Speaker 1:          01:11:00       So robert trevors is wonderful biologist who started a lot of the kinds of work that we're talking about going in the seventies, calls these sorts of things of phenotypic intelligence, right? So evolution gave you these pleasure centers in your brain so that you do in your genes best interests and kill the animal or get the girl or whatever and that makes you feel good. And so we tend to like the things that are good for us in dislike, the things that are bad for us. We don't want to eat feces, we do on a to stick. So there's cases like this where it short circuits that it goes right to the pleasure center. Even though what it's doing, it's kind of irrelevant, but this is a case where maybe it wasn't irrelevant. Maybe it actually causes animals to then change the way that they behave to become more sociable.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       Right. It's very possible. Something like that played a role along the way, which is why if you replay the sequence, the vanishing rainforest 10 times, only one time does it maybe lead to anything good and the other nine times that leads to a bunch of dead chimps. Yeah. Well the the process is probably incredibly slow, right? Over millions of years of the climate did alter was right, so you've got millions of years for the rain forest to disappear, so you get these animals to slowly, slowly say, I've got no choice. So they figure it out and then I think for three and a half million years, literally there's skulking around the edges and they figured nothing out, but there was a pressure on them to walk up. Right. And nobody knows for sure what that pressure is. One hypothesis that has some possible. There's probably a lot of reasons, right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:19       Any time something big happens is probably a lot of causes. So some people said that you can cover ground more efficiently when you walk up. Right? With fewer calories, and especially this idea of slowly running down animals. You may have heard about this notion of persistence hunting exactly and talked about that yesterday. And so, um, the uh, but another reason is so ask yourself, so why would an animal, so if we back up a little bit, remember I talked about how older one tools which are made even later than when we first started walking upright. So there even after that, all the tools are never carried it. Integrate distance from where they are acquired inmate. And so what you have is an animal, just like today's chimps, they can't plan for tomorrow. So a chimp can plan for needs that are currently feels, it can say, oh, I want to go get 'em termites out of that mound all break the stick off.

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       I'll strip the leaves and then I'll go over there and do that. But it can't plan for the fact that it might have that need again tomorrow if it doesn't feel the need can plan for it and humans can plan for unfelt needs. And the best example of that is notion of taking a tool with you that you've now used in st. Well, I want to use it again tomorrow, right, so whichever. Also a pythagoras was the first one to start walking upright was almost assuredly incapable of planning for the future for unfilled needs, but it could plan for felt needs because the chimp can do that too. And if you think about how would you feel if you're about to walk across the open savannah and you're kind of small and leopards and lions are way faster than you. I think the primary thing could feel his fear like, oh shit, I'm going to get attacked and so I want something in my hands to help me defend myself. Let's be. You're a club, a stick something. And so what I suspect is a part of the process is my desire to hold something in my hand as I'm looking around and I'm scared and a bunch of us are doing that and so I suspect that that's what led to played a role in leading to bipedalism. There would have been other factors at play like persistence hunting and stuff, but I suspect that came later. So whole actually

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       holding a weapon might've led to the beginning of that just because you don't need to be a rocket scientist. You're scAred now. You want something to defend yourself. Do we have evidence of them sharpening sticks? Will remember. So modern chimps who live on the savannah do sharpen sticks. Modern. yeah. What do we have evidence of ancient man and we don't even. We don't even have sticks leftover for rectus. We know they must have used them because they're making some pretty complicated stones. And so surely they were sharpening sticks, but all of it's decade. So what year did we. So we really don't know when they first started attaching these stone tools to sticks rail, waking axes, spears. We know that that's happening very recently by homo sapiens. We don't know if it happened before that. If I had to guess, I would say that homo erectus did that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       If you look at the quality of other things that they've done. So for example, there's this amazing site off the sea of galilee. It's about 700,000 years old. So member humans, homo sapiens, let's call it 300,000 years. So now we're 700,000 or so years ago and there's this elephant skull that's been turned over so that they can get access to the brain's friend. This thing is unwieldy. It's heavy as anything. You got to have people working together to turn that thing over and there's even a log underneath it that might've been used as a lever to kinda help plop thing over. So what you got is people are quite capable of working together. They know what they're trying to achieve, they know how to access those things. I suspect that they knew that they could sharpen the stake or maybe even have to put a stone to make it even better.

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       It's just that we can't find any evidence for that. At least not yet. He wasn't there. Some certain really ancient evidence of cannibalism too because of the scrape marks inside of skulls and they think that they were scooping out brain matter. That's possible. I haven't seen those data, but absolutely you can see where they've used those tools on like the legs of animals and things like that. So you'd see it inside the skull as well. A human skull that, um, I'm sure you're aware of that little person that was discovered just a few years ago. I think it was like a decade or so ago that on Indonesia and a flores. Yeah. Yeah. They think that little person type thing using stone tools, right? Yes. Those guys. So remember there. So what happened about one point 6 million years ago, we'll call it one point seven, I don't remember exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:16:24       homo erectus leaves africa, but they also stay. So you got home rectus basically colonizing all of africa and you've got homo erectus colonizing almost all of europe, all of southern asia. And so they don't, they don't go beyond that, at least not to our knowledge. Maybe they dId, but um, but they certainly covered all that ground and an outside of. So now you've got homo erectus in africa and homo erectus outside of africa. And of course then overtime, both of them are going to evolve and change the ones outside of africa and depth as neanderthals. Those, the most recent recent instantiation of them, the ones inside of africa ended up is us. And so when we leave africa, the first thing we encountered as neanderthals in arabia, because that's the first point of entry out of africa, and so we probably started copulating with them there.

Speaker 2:          01:17:05       We know we started copulating with them soon afterward. So as we left they involved somewhere else. They evolved in europe and asia and so they had evolved from some other type of the same ancestors. So our. Okay. Our great uncle left and our great grandpa stayed. And so the ones who left, some of them evolved into those people on flores to those tiny little people. Some of them we know this, dentists sylvan from a pinky bone, you know, in a cave inside Russia. And we have got, we know that we interbred with neanderthals and that's where a lot of our genes that we currently have for light skin and blue eyes and things like that come from and they think we interbred with denisovans as well, right? Well not all of us. So there's some, there's evidence for melanesians if I remember having dennis blood, our dna I don't, I don't know about.

Speaker 2:          01:17:49       so it may turn out that we did. Um, I don't think so though, but there's no evidence that humans interbred with the folks from flores. Not that I know of. I've never seen that. They're tiny. They're really good. They're very small. They're like hobbit. Like now that doesn't mean that if, if, if we well know we would have. It's possible that we could have overlapped with them if somebody would do it. Yeah. so like we hit, we hit Australia by 65,000 years ago and I don't remember when the floor is people we hit Australia at 65,000 years ago. Wow. And that was through some sort of boat traveling. So 65,000 years ago would've still been ice age and so we would have had a lot less water. And so if you, if you look at topographical maps then when you look at what the pacific islanders didn't stuff, it seems ballsy as hell, but it's a little less ballsy when you can keep seeing the next piece of land.

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       Not not as far away compared to now where the seed is much higher and you can't see the land. Oh, okay. So when the pacific islanders like traveled to Hawaii, you think they could see things? Yeah, they could see a lot better. Now. The most recent that the very last place, the pacific islander settled as New Zealand. That's only 700 years ago, so that's the same as today. But um, but a lot of that discovery was done at a time where the seed was a lot lower and so there'd be a lot more islands ticking up that we don't currently have 700 years ago they had much more sophisticated boats. Yeah. That was awesome. You records and all that. Yeah, it is crazy when you think about like we're like little rats with the way we've scattered across the globe. And if you, if you think about it, it, it seems like it's all ballsy exploration, but I actually suspect a bigger part of it is running away from the guy behind you.

Speaker 2:          01:19:25       It's causing problems. And so my favorite example of that is if you look at the cliff dwellings, like in the american southwest, and you go there and thinking who the hell would live like this? I mean, you know, when junior walks out there, but if the people down in the valley are scarier than the risk of falling outside uk, you're going to live up in a cave dwelling where they're going to climb up to get. And that's part of the memory we talked about sexual selection as a source of people don't like unfairness. Well, people also don't like unfairness between groups because if you and I make a deal and you know, I'm from Ohio and you're from California and the California has benefit more than the ohioans. Even though my benefit, you benefit more noW I'm at risk because maybe your group, you know, ancestrally it's going to cause my group problems. Interesting. So when

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       you're studying all this stuff, how does that make you feel as a person? Do you mean? Do you, do you. Could you ever internalize all this stuff when you're thinking about like all the weird ape, like creatures that turned into people and all the thousands and thousands of years of evolution and how it could have gone left and it did go right. And does That freak you out when you really get deep into the study of all this stuff?

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       It first of all, I do this all the time, right? so it doesn't freak me out, but it's what I like and it also, we can talk about all the ways that you can predict things about our modern cells based on knowing these things in the past. Right. But secondarily, what freaks me out the most probably is the enormous role of random chance and all this. Right? And so if you think about the, I mean, just think about our own backgrounds, the random chance that our mom and dad got amaris the night that they did made you and me if, if they did a different position, maybe your brother's talking to my brother, right? Yeah. So it's reAlly which sperm wins that race is so unlikely to be us. Right? And so every roll of the dice has to go your way. Right. And so the role of chance and all this kind of freaks you out if you think about that.

Speaker 1:          01:21:12       But at the same time your brother is probably a lot like you and my brother is probably a lot like me or my sister or whatever. And so you have one child or have more? I've got a boy and a girl. Okay. Yeah. Well you know, then that they're so different right out of the box, which is really weird. It is weird. So I don't know if you saw this book, the ploumen just wrote called blueprint robert plomin who's a behavioral geneticists. I haven't seen that. Our, it's a lovely book. Just came out and just really recently, like a month or two at the most. How do you say his name? P l o m I n robert pillowman. And um, he's a wonderful behaviors geneticists over in the uk and this book blueprint talks about the role of genes and all this. And he, he basically is one of these people who's been in the field almost since it got started.

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       And what they kept thinking is that the environment was going to play a huge role, that parents were going to play a huge role, but of course what they keep finding over and over again. there you go. There's how dna makes us who we are and what they find over and over again, and this was so disconcerting, is first of all, on average, most things are about 50 percent genetic, but the bummer is that the other half isn't, isn't what's happened in your house and the way you're brought up by your folks. It's the random other stuff like the first, we don't even know what it is. It's just, it's what we call unshared environment. Maybe that first girlfriend you had, maybe you biked into a tree and you unimproved your face, you know a million different things that specifically happened to you that didn't happen to everybody else in your family. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:22:40       And also the way you address those things that happen and that could have a factor that could be a factor in how you were raised and how you were taught to deal with stress. How you were taught to deal with situations and character development,

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       but all the data suggest, not suggest parents just don't matter how you were taught doesn't seem to play a role because when we parse up all the different traits about you, there's a few that your parents actually have a big influence on what religion you're in, for example, but not how religious you are. SO the biggest role that you play seems to be when sperm medic. So a friend of mine, the analogy they made when, when I, when I had my first kid is these, he says, here's what you're going to find out that you're handed. When the baby's born, you're handed a negative. It's the pictures already been taken. You can screw it up by being in the dark room a little bit wrong or you can help it a little bit by being in the darkroom a little bit. Right? But the photograph is already there and my son and my daughter are wildly different in some ways. In some ways they're quite similar, but I feel like I'm along for the ride more than I feel like I'm shaping them to make them who they are, but don't you think you're shaping him somewhat? I'm trying. Look, that's what we do, but the date is say no, but how would the data? No, I mean, so here's how we do

Speaker 3:          01:23:47       to study so many different human beings. You have to. You have to take into account all the variables that took place during all the developmental periods of their life.

Speaker 1:          01:23:56       Well, the it to do it right, you need to do all that and we can't do that yet and to do it right. What you want is actually to have that. The actual genetic markers, not just to know that the genes are there and that's all starting now, but. But we don't know yet. What they do do is they'll say, well, we got a bunch of where there's two ways to go about this. Employment was at the front of both of them. One, you look at adaptive studies versus kids who are adopted into a family versus biological and you can compare the parents of the adopted kids to the biological parents versus the home parents, and it turns out that the biological parents predict a whole lot more about the adopted child than the parents who raised them. The parents were raised in predict almost nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:24:33       Whoa. I know, and then the second thing you can do is you can look at fraternal versus a monozygotic identical twins and you find that the when you then they all share the same environment. They're, they're all brought up by you and me, right? Where the parents of these kids, but the they also, there's a lot of unshared environment and that's when they differ. It's not because of you and me, we can't find any evidence that you and me that you and I made any difference. All we can find is evidence that other things in their life made a difference. Not to say that means what we really don't know is, well, what is that unshared environment? All we know is it's not something about your household because that would cause fraternal and identical twins to both be more similar to each other and it doesn't.

Speaker 3:          01:25:13       Well obviously a lot. There's not a lot of data in terms of when you're measuring someone's entire life from birth to death, but there's enough that people are starting to draw conclusions. One of the more interesting ones is when you see identical twins that were raised in different households without any knowledge of each other, and then they run into each other 30 years later and they find out they have disturbing similarity. YeAh,

Speaker 1:          01:25:38       that's exactly another example, and what's also interesting about it, which plum and talks about in blueprint is that your genes become more powerful as you age. So the heritability of things like iq goes up as you get older, and so the argument is that your gene seemed to be causing you to select out environments. So you gave the example, well, maybe the way that you discipline them or tell them to be resilient or whatever you do as a parent causes them to shape their environment. It doesn't seem to be the case, but it does seem to be the case that the genes that you give them caused them to select their environments in certain ways because remember, kids choose their friends, right? You want them to play with timmy, but they want to play with johnny. That's, that's the unshared environment. They're making those choices every day.

Speaker 1:          01:26:20       It's also the case that their peers matter a whole lot more than their parents do once they get to a certain age. You know, I'm chopped liver as soon as my kids are a bit older, but when I'm young, I'm their hero right now. When you. When you say that your genes become more powerful as you get older, what do you mean by that though? Well, they, they are more predictive of the outcome and so if you look at the heritability of iq when you're a kid, it's lower than when you're an adult and it's lower still than when you're an older adult, and so what seems to be happening to a lot of our traits? Probably almost usually. Are you saying that like if you have children as an older person, it's charitable as the kids get older. Sorry. Okay, so as a. So if you look at the heritability of iq when kids are two, four, eight, 10, 20, 60, you find that identical twins come more and more together as they age, whether they're aging in the same household or not.

Speaker 1:          01:27:09       And so There's something about selecting your environment. So like here's one kid who loves to think of do puzzles and it's identical. Twin loves due to the same and they kind of get smarter their whole lives. Here's another kid who's not interested in that. They have other interests and they go in a different direction, but when you're, when you're the parent, you can be busily pushing them to do the things you want them to do and so they're heritability is less strong and there's, there's lots of cool examples. It's like when totalitarian governments are eliminated in the school system becomes more fair. Heritability of intelligence goes up in those societies because kids are now more capable of selecting the schools. they want to go to the environments that they want to be part of. Wow. What we're. We're so flexible. It's so weird when you think about all the various styles of civilization that human beings exist in and thrive in.

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       Right? And, and for me, that's the key. So when a lot of people hear about this, they sort, it sounds like genetic determinism that your genes are forcing you to be a certain way, but for me it's, there's nothing genetic determinism that you can think of about as a genetic nudge. Part of your nudge is going to come from the dna your inherited, but part of it's going to come from the environment and part of it's going to come from your own personal decisions. So in my mind we talk about in terms of your mind, because that's what psychology, but an easier example is your muscles. You know, some people inherit genes that if they lift one, wait once, they're both other people's genes. They have to work out a lot if they want to gain anything, but you can still decide I'm going to work out a lot or I'm not.

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       I'm gonna eat these nutrients or you know, a lot of protein or not. You can choose a lifestyle that leads you to be more muscular, less so. it's partially choice. It's partially environment. It's partially that interaction between your genes and environment, which would make sense if you think about how flexible we are. AbsoLutely. It has to be active that we are. It has to be because human beings have to learn how to survive in every environment on this planet. If we were mere cats or something, well, we got a certain way of doing things and your genes can basically tell you what to do and with mere cats there's some really interesting experiments where you can show your genes, caused you to listen to one signal and just follow that. But as human beings, your genes have no choice but to give up control. Once we went down this cognitive pathway that emphasizes learning over inborn instincts, you know you've had a little ones. You know they're worthless when they're babies, right? Baby willdabeast gets up and off. It can go run away from a lion.

Speaker 3:          01:29:18       Yeah. It's just so fantastically complicated. The developmental process from birth to adulthood and that this is taking place simultaneously amongst hundreds and hundreds of millions of people with varying results and all sorts of different levels of creativity and ingenuity and mathematical prowess and literature and all these different things that are being created by all these different, weird little ape creatures everywhere. And there's so many different factors that determine what this ape creature becomes.

Speaker 1:          01:29:53       Right? And that's one of the best things in my mind about being a person. So if like if you're a dung beetle, you got one job in life, push up all the poor and you can't push a ball, a poo, that's three times your body weight. well that's the end of the line for you, right? But if you're a human, maybe you're big and strong, maybe you're not. Maybe you're really smart, maybe you're not. Maybe you're really creative, you know, there's a million ways to skin that cat. And, and the great thing about being in the human is that any good at any of those things, there's a niche for you. You will be beneficial. And because we evolved to all work together, there'll be value in you, you're my favorite barista, you're my favorite, whatever, whatever you're good at. And everybody's good at something.

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       And so the thing is that people worry about the sort of upcoming genetic revolution that it's going to be, whether it's going to be the good and everybody else, and that's just not going to happen. Because one of the things that we know, and you'll see this if you look at blueprint, is that you have a kazillion jeans on july. Every trait, there aren't five smart genes. There's like a thousand of them. And furthermore, each one of them only accounts for a tiny, tiny bit and they do lots of other things too. So you can't like, you can't make a designer baby that has all these qualities because all you do is noodle around with five or six genes. There's a couple of disorders that work that way. But our personalities, our abilities, our proclivities are all heavily determined by large numbers of genes that do lots and lots of different things. But we're talking,

Speaker 3:          01:31:06       talking about our understanding of genetics currently. Yes. And when you talk about things like genetic manipulation or the use of crispr or any of these maybe new tools that they're working on right now, they've already updated crispr. They were crisper point two, right? When, when this continues to evolve and more and more innovation takes place in that world, don't you think they're going to get to a point where they're going to understand all the various factors and genetics and they're going to be able to create a person who looks like thor?

Speaker 1:          01:31:38       Well, yes and no. So in principle, yes. So you've got like, I don't know, 3 billion base pairs in your dna and most of those we all share all the same ones. So screw the ones that are shared. We don't care about those. All we can do is noodle around with the ones that aren't. Now what makes it complicated is that most of the ones that differ between people are actually non there in what we now call the regulatory region. We used to think of as junk dna, but now we know. Well, think about a company, a company that makes widgets, doesn't just make widgets, has to have sales, avesta marketing and asset management, and now we know, well sure enough, a lot of the dna that's not coding for proteins is working with the other dna to turn things on and turn things off and there's 3 billion base pairs.

Speaker 1:          01:32:16       So there's that level of complexity. There is outrageous, right? So, but let's still some day we'll get it right. It's not you and I won't see it. And and what we now know from these studies, g was studies a genome wide association studies is that you can look at all the very base pairs that very and you can say, all right, which one of these things are correlated with my outcome of interest? And so you say, oh, education. And they create what's called apologetics score and you say, let's predict how many years of education you're going to get. And sure enough, the richer you are on average, the higher your polygenic score is it you're born into a rich family. You probably have a higher apologetics score, but if you're apologetic, score for education is lower than the average for your thing. You'll probably get poor across your life if it's higher, you probably get richard, is that a gene for being smart, for sitting there and doing what you're told for self control like it could be and there's a thousand things in there and each one of them accounts for one 10th of one percent of the variants, but what makes it complicated is that whole set of genes also predicts how artistic you are, but in a different combination and it predicts how friendly you are in a different combination and so the the the genes that do one set of things almost always do lots of things and we have very few traits through that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       don't have lots and lots of genes that each play a tiny role underneath them. The example ploumen gives in his book, which I think is great, he says, we started out looking for golden nuggets and we now realize we looking for gold dust. It's just lots of tiny stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:33:39       They're so in many ways when you're looking at a one, you know, you talk about the human genome and our genetic code, we're, we're really similar to computer programs and that there's millions and millions of lines of code and computer programs, but we know how to make computer programs so we know what these will. We don't need to know somebody smarter than both of us knows how to make these incredible, you know, that lead to operating systems.

Speaker 1:          01:34:07       But now we're writing codeS that we don't understand. So if you look at neural networks, they'll be input levels in the output levels in the fricking computer decides how to mix those things together and we don't even know what the it's done. And two of them that are learning the same thing might get there via different mechanisms.

Speaker 3:          01:34:20       So by that idea or with it through that idea, wouldn't you think that artificial intelligence could lead to the mapping out of the human genome or rather the altering of the human genome and mapping out a different type of human

Speaker 1:          01:34:33       look? In principle it could and, and, and it may and all I would say is that you, what we thought though is that there'd be five smart genes that really matter and the rest are trivial and so turn on those five smart once everybody's going to want that and there'll be five funny jeans and we'll turn those on, you know, et cetera. But there's not. and so what that means is I got to decide what, imagine this future world where I'm about to have a baby and I can crisper the whole thing and I have to decide what genes I'll say, well I can make them smarter, but then he's not going to be very friendly, you know, whatever. Right? The old trade off against each other. You could get the big dick gene, but it doesn't exactly give them glasses. Exactly. And so the thing is that it makes it. So yeah, we will get rid of things, these single gene disorders that are awful. Right? Right. But we're not gonna I suspect we're not going to noodle around with our smarts and our personalitY because every single change we make is going to have a commensurate change somewhere else. Oh, well I can make a smarter, but then he's going to be depressed. And you know,

Speaker 3:          01:35:28       like that. Yeah. That, that is a boy, that the idea of playing god like that. I mean, that's, that's really mean. We are playing creator. I don't even necessarily think we should use the word god in that respect because it's something that's already been created. But we're taking this life form and radically altering it

Speaker 1:          01:35:49       and we can already do that and people will start doing it soon. And we, like when I was a kid, when we were kids, ivf is playing god, now it's a triviality that is, that is crazy what we're do. You don't think that this is gonna take place in our lifetime that maybe Russia and China is going to make some super person, not too many genes that play too small of a role. And so the thing is that the, um, it, it's too hard to mess around with. It's too hard to make the to to create these things. There's nO reason that you'd be a lot better off if you just did selective breeding and the reality is you don't even need to. People already assertively, mate. They already choose partners who were similar to themselves. If they value education, the other person does two.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       If they value athletics, the other person does too. That works so much better than anything that we're capable of doing right now and when you do these, ge was studies with these polygenic scores and you say, oh look, you're born into a social class and suggested to it probably behind. You're just kind of low and sure enough, you get poor across your life. You're literally accounting for three percent of the variants. You're barely explaining anything because even though when we look at the behavioral genetic studies, we can say, wow, intelligence has 50 percent genetic. We can't come close to finding the genes that actually do that, and part of the reason we don't know, but part of the reason may be that first of all, it's course 50 percent environmental and what those random things are. We don't know and second think about how you were 3 billion base pairs, how many things, maybe when those two are in place in that one isn't in the third one can be interactions that really, really complicated levels where you're almost dead infinite. And so that's why I don't think it happens when you and I around to see it.

Speaker 3:          01:37:23       I think you're probably right. But then I just realized that things like crispr, which were invented by accident, came out of nowhere less than a decade ago. I believe it was less than a decade ago. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:37:35       It's super recent. It's outside of the. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:37:37       And then if you really stop and think about even the mapping of the human genome, it used to be an unbelievably difficult thing. Yeah. And then, you know, checking your genetics was preposterously expensive. Now you just spit into a little tube and send it to 23 and me and they, they tell you, hey bro, you

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       know, someone in your family is from europe and this guy's from asia and yeah, and so I could easily be wrong that you and I will see it and it's only 10 years away because competition really, it seems so hard right now. But things that were competition the impossible when I was in grad school, you know, the simple analyses we did with our data in grad school, it's just like a phone could do that so easily now. And we waited 24 hours for the mainframe to give it back to us. Kurzweil talks about that, that we really don't see things in terms of the exponential increase in technology. You know, kurzweil believes all this is going to happen, plus more. He thinks you're going to be able to download your brain into a computer and you know, and he started ourselves and smarter than me.

Speaker 4:          01:38:34       I don't know if he's smarter than, you know, he's definitely smarter than me and his research has just turned on the world's most powerful super computer designed to mimic a human brain. Won't think I was telling you about a week or last week. That sounds pretty scary. Computer neural morphic computer just got a big boost with a million core supercomputer that took over a decade to build. Mother. Yeah. This is the beginning of a movie, right? Right. It doesn't go well, but here's the thing, right? This movie in this movie, this is a whole room full of computers, just like the apollo missions. Use the room for a computer that can't fuck with your phone and this was really crazy. That's 1965. Sixty six, 67, right? They, they had a room. This iphone, berries that room full of fucking shitty ass computers and 10 plus it takes pictures. Do you remember when your kids and everybody said everyone will have their own phone and I'm thinking, who the hell wants a phone?

Speaker 4:          01:39:27       Like my mom will just reach me wherever I go. She didn't know what a phone could do in those. Nice to have a bit. And this is only from 2005 from a netflix special I did in 2005, which, you know, it's 13 years ago, but doesn't seem like that long ago, but I was making fun of people texting because uh, I was like, hey bro, why? Why are you making me read? Call me. I go, well, you're sending me texts from a fall, you will fucking call me. It takes you four presses to get an s. That was back when you had numbers. Yeah. And then that was also back when people thought it was cool to have those walkie talkies, those nextel phones. Do you remember that? That was like a big deal to have a walkie talkie on a phone that died out, thankfully.

Speaker 4:          01:40:11       But this, this whole change in the way we view technology from 2005 to 2018. The world is a radically different place. And the funny thing is that you and I both make a living by observing the human condition, right? That's our job and we both get it wrong. Constantly write every day. You got that? The texting, what the hell is that? I remember my sister showed me facebook because she was in an ngo and they're using it to keep track of each other. I was like, yeah, people don't want to do that shit. I'm wrong. Every time, every single time I'm wrong. I follow quite a few people on facebook that are nuts and uh, I go to their pages just to see what kind of arguments or getting into like as a sociological experiment. And there are people that are on facebook arguing about trump or abortion or islam or fill in the blank, environmental concerns, fracking.

Speaker 4:          01:41:05       And they just fucking argue all day long. It's fascinating. You look at their timeline, you look at it, the entries and you're like, oh my god, there's like 10 hours of this shit in a day. And they just do it all day long. And you just picture this sweaty person sitting in front of a computer arguing with the world. I never would have thought that there'd be people sitting in front of their desk arguing with people that they can't see all throughout the world. Who thought that? Who thought that would be fun? I don't think it is fun. I think it's an impulsive, obsessive thing that people get sucked into and I think they're vastly healthier and happier when they're not engaged in it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:44       Yeah. Well, I mean the truth of the matter is, and this comes back to the past again, so you. We talked about all of these differences, so one of the really lovely things that you can do is look for the past and then say, well, how does that manifest itself today? And one of my favorite examples is the whites of your eyes. So chimpanzees have brown eyes. The sclerA around the cornea. Ours are white. Why would you do that? Well then advertise as the direction of your gaze. Why would you advertise the direction case? Because what that says is that on average as a human, when I look over there and see something, I want you to know that I saw it. You and I are probably going to cooperate to help us achieve whatever the goal is that I just encountered. A chimp wants to hide it from its fellow chimps because it's competitive, right?

Speaker 1:          01:42:23       On average, whatever the hell is over there, you're not going to help me get it right or. Yeah, exactly. You're gonna. Make it harder for me to get it. yeah. The chimps ever did our amazingly, amazingly groupers and octopi hunt together and they do that. Groupers and octopi work together, the so the group will be over the great barrier reef and the fish has gone in and he goes to the octopus and he goes right there. No one reason. He doesn't give a shit about the octopus of course, but if the octopus goes to get it and doesn't get it, it's going to come out and the group has got it. Cooperation always works better than working on your own. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:42:56       Wow. So is there real evidence that shows that the whites of our eyes developed in order to indicate which way we're looking?

Speaker 1:          01:43:02       Well, in all these cases, all we can do is say, let's do a little phylogenetic analysis. Who's got an and who doesn't? We're the only great ape with whites to their eyes. So 90. So we're going to look at it. Get

Speaker 4:          01:43:11       this. Here's an octopus that's chilling. And is that a group or. It's a weird look and spot it. I guess. I don't know really pretty. It looks like a coral trout to me. Oh man, what do I know? Look how pretty that octopuses too. and they're really fucking love octopus and they can change colors like that. Yeah. we've gone down massive rabbit holes with these things for hours at a time. Look at it is changing right now. It's. We're watching him, so he's sitting there waiting and the fish tries to get out and the guy that's really cool. The way they have the good sense to work together. Look at the octopuses matt. It's getting dark. Oh cool. His skin is so. It just changes and morphs as you're looking at it. That is so bizarre. What a crate. I didn't, you know, I didn't know that they could do this until my friend remy warren came on the podcast and he had a television show called apex predator and within on the show they would study all the various ways these animals would hunt and the way they would, you know, all the different adaptations to their environment, all the different ways that they would use the environment and, and he would try to mimic those different ways and one of the things that they studied was octopus and what's that other fish that's like it.

Speaker 4:          01:44:29       The cuddle fish, which is also the same thing. Octopus is using a clamshell. What is he doing? He's lounging. He found that he picked it up. Oh my god, there's a bbc. This is crazy. Oh my god. The octopus is climbing inside of clamshell and then he closes it. That is bananas. There's a bbc blue planet where it shows the octopus picking up all that random shrapnel when there's a shark coming after it and it covers itself like a big ball and the shark keeps going. Wow. They're super smart octopi. Well, they eat sharks. You ever see that one? There was a video where they found this aquarium was having an issue with sharks were disappearing. They couldn't figure out what was going on and they put a camera inside the aquarium, but it turned out that the octopus was waiting, just chilling on the rocks till the sharks came by and then he would snatch them and eat them.

Speaker 4:          01:45:22       Watch this. It's really cool to watch. He's like do to do to who? Me don't bother with me. I'm just a piece of coral. I'm just hanging out here being clear you like, cause he looks exactly even in texture like the coral, which is so fascinating. But when they found this, they were stunned. They had no idea that octopus could do that. Could not only that they could do that, but that they would eat a shark and at the big fight. Fuck man. It's not though. You want to squeeze the thing first, but it's an easy fight. It looks like. Is the thing about octopus though too? They could sacrifice a technical and it just grows back. So really no big deal. It's annoying, but I don't even know if it's annoying. I mean we're just guessing. Right. So there's a fascinating animal. There's a rivet twisted them up.

Speaker 4:          01:46:12       It was an amazing case in Australia where a coolant brown is a biologist, had cuddle fish in this tank and they can signal like an octopus octopus. They can do whatever color and in this tank he's got a bunch of females on one side, a bunch of males than the other. So male goes in between them and he signals to different sides of his body. He shows a female, he's male, but he shows the males that he's female, so they want to attack him for a sidling up to the female. Yeah. How smart is that? It's weird. it's weird that they split off from us hundreds of millions of years ago. Right? Like as closely related to salary. Basically. It's crazy, but they're so smart and their eyes are similar to ours and like in the development

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       actually it's the opposite. So there our eyes are poorly designed. There's a very well designed so our eyes have all the detecting stuff is in its own way. It's backwards and so the light comes in and has to pass all the cellular bodies before it can get picked up by the detectors. There's aim in the proper direction so the shit isn't in the way and we have this blind spot because the big thing, the nerve connection, they don't. There's comes in from the back where it belongs. So what that tells you is that yeah, we both started out with some kind of randoms light sensitive spot and there's happened to work much better if you want to turn it into an eyeball than ours did because evolution can always. It only can start with what you got. Right. But there's work better because they could see in water.

Speaker 2:          01:47:28       I mean, no, I mean because there I think it's purely random that they don't have. We do a great job of getting rid of the segue of their bodies that are in our way. So what you're it does is it wiggles all the time and so if anything's retinal stationary, it's wiggling and equally with your eyeball you ignore it and so you don't even know. You have your own blind spot. You feel it in your brain does amazing things to fix the problem. If you have a piece of lint on your eye or something like that, if it were literally attached to vinci would disappear and because your brain says, oh, that's irrelevant, and so you can't see your own blind spot unless you close one eye and then you sit there with a neutral background, you move your thumb across and literally your thumbnail disappears because that spot is just being filled in by whatever the background and what happens with the octopus.

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       It doesn't have that problem because our nerve endings creates the bond spot by being on the wrong side. There's comes in from the back and so the whole thing works beautifully. They don't have to deal with the blind spot. Would that be as effective though in the world that we live in? Yeah. It's a water area irrelevant. It's purely, it happenstance that the light sensitive pit that they had started to get innovated properly from the back and ours didn't, and then as ours evolved into an. I mean, of course we don't know this, but as far as evolved tonight, we just had to find ways around the problem that all the fancy structures that we now need in front of it or in the way. Does anything have an eye like an octopus that lives on land? Great question. I don't know. I don't see.

Speaker 2:          01:48:46       I've read something about eyes that they think that I got shit information. Now you're pregnant. Memory that they have an amazing memory. All these shows. These still sore away. That's too many shows, man. I don't have any memory anymore. So it's like full. Yeah. I feel like I'm like a hoarder. Like my house is filled with boxes of shit that I don't need. That's how brains work. I'm afraid how brains work, right? I mean it must be because like I know that there's a lot of stuff in there that didn't use to be in there before, but I also know like it's like random people that I should remember that I don't remember. Yeah. Well no. The funny thing about brains is we may never forget anything but we just lose our capacity to access it, but the data suggests it may still guide our behavior and so every single experience you've ever had may still be in there and it guides your behavior, but, but it's use, it's annoying for you to recall it because it gets in the way of what you want. And so when we talk about forgetting what we're actually talking about is being able to actually retrieve it and talk about it, not to have it guide our action. Well also I can, I can retrieve things far better if I get access the file

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       by someone else's memory. So like if you and I had an experience like 10 years ago, we went on a camping trip or something like that and I forgot something that happened. And you said, do you remember what happened by the creek when mike hurt his foot away, right?

Speaker 2:          01:49:59       Oh yes. Exactly. Oh my god, I forgot about that. And then next thing you know, you have this memory, right? and so what we've done is you've broken the access in and so, but if you, you could literally find the sneakers were go, holy crap, you know. And so that's how our brain is designed it, it's, it's annoying to retrieve when you're looking for one thing to retrieve everything. If it's important or happened recently, it probably should be retrieved. If it's not, let it sit away and it'll still got your baby. You won't put your foot in that same hole when you and mike go on the camping trip the next time. But you won't even remember why.

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       Right. And in likely significant lessons are important because there are seared in your memory of this is a, this is a significant point where you figured something out they didn't know before and it changed the way you looked at the world. So this is seared in your memory.

Speaker 2:          01:50:45       Yeah. And so when emotions get involved, you tend to have, it's much more easily retrieved later on because your brain is saying, yeah, that's our evolution, or whatever you wanna call it is telling you that it's important that should be retrievable. And and what you had yesterday for lunch, I can never retrieve.

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       Right? That's one of the reasons why epidemiology studies on diet are so difficult because people don't remember what that day was. The same thing every day. Yeah. Yeah. It's, the human mind is so fascinating and it varies so much and there's so many different factors involved and whatever it becomes cultural factors and environmental factors, dietary,

Speaker 2:          01:51:22       and that's all that flexibility that we evolved to put us in that special place that we are. And so we made a deal, right? So we said, all right, we're going to start going down this cognitive pathway, but that means that there's very little inboard knowledge and that means that we're going to have to learn from people older than us and people with experience there. And that means that and the best way to learn from them as high fidelity copying. And so if you happen to go off in a direction where they use chopsticks, well that's how you eat. You happen to go in a direction, that's how you eat. There's a million ways to do things. And so we started with the sort of argument about, well, it wasn't monogamy or not, right, and the, um, I'm arguing that by and large it was monogamy because you've got these systems in place that our testicles aren't big enough, we've got cryptic ovulation, which means that we can't tell when she's fertile, which means that we have to be available sexually interested in available all the time so we can make sure we're the father.

Speaker 2:          01:52:10       And so that allows her to pair bond with us. And there's some evidence that orgasm is a pair bonding experience, certainly for females, probably for males. it works in lots of animals via oxytocin and vasopressin, all that kind of stuff. Right? So all that suggests that probably on average that we evolved to do it this way, but we're so super dooper flexible that went. Another society says, well, hey, this works for us. Off we go and we find a way to make that work. Are there studies that compared testicle size of different civilizations, different cultures? Yeah. So there's a lot of argument about this. And the problem is that the prince, it's racist, it's racist. That's what underlies

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       a lot of it, but we get this right, so the thing is that that the, the, the genetics that explain why one animal or one species would have large testicles and other a small testicles are not the genetics. That would explain why two different individuals in the same species would be that way. Because the only way to make that latter one work is you have to inherit a constellation of traits. So if I'm an inherit the genes for big balls and for impulsiveness and for having lots of kids and not caring much about him and all of the things that are supposedly go with that, that do. When you look between species, there's no way for the constellation of traits to be inherited together. Because remember I was talking about how polygenic everything is and so they'd all literally need to sit next to each other on the chromosome.

Speaker 1:          01:53:26       If they've got any chance of being passed on as a package and they don't. And you also get all the shifting around her. In meiosis. I can't remember the term for off the top of my head, but where the pieces of genetic material move around and that virtually guarantees that you're not going to inherit this huge constellation of traits within a species between species is dead easy. You know, you're A species inherits big testicles and inherits impulsiveness. It inherits whatever, uh, and our strategy just reproduce it down and ignore them in all that kind of stuff's dead easy. And so cim fathers don't pay any attention to chimp babies to speak of because while that's their mating system, right? Whereas I'm, you've got pair bonded gibbons and things and now parents start to play a much bigger. Even male parents start to play a bigger role, but there's no studies that show that human beings with archer testicles tend to ignore their children.

Speaker 1:          01:54:14       Well, so this is just that people have tried to show that, but here's the problem. And tried to show that in studies. So lots of people make that argument and it's called life history strategies where you say, well, you're going to develop one life history strategy in these circumstances and another and these other circumstances. The problem is that you end up with ethnic differences in testicle size, which we know exist and you also have ethnic differences in where in the kinds of lives that people currently lead. The difficult thing is it's super easy to look at the world we are in right now and this is what tripped me up earlier as well. You look at the world that we are right now and assume, well, that's the way things have always been and they haven't, and so right now you know the mathematics used for awhile.

Speaker 1:          01:54:52       They're the best math in the world was taking place in the arabic world. Now it's not anymore, and so if you, if you don't know that past, you'd say, well look, people in the arabic world aren't as good at mathematics and they have these qualities and that you'd make an inference. Right now the ethnic differences in testicles, I believe, but I can't promise you that. it's some different. West african groups happen to have the largest testicle size on average. Those west african groups tend to be poorer right now. There's lots of things about life that go with being poor that looked like and our strategy, having lots of kids and paying less attention to them, but what you're probably looking at is a coincidental association between some biology and some part of some way that your your people happen to live that didn't exist a while ago and that won't exist awhile from now and so it's really easy to try to use this research which people have to say, well, you've got primitive people who have big testicles and low parental effort and you've got some more sophisticated people with smaller testicles and high parental effort, but that's genetically super naive.

Speaker 3:          01:55:52       One of the things that I learned when I was in rome, we took a tour of the vatican by this guy who's a professor. It was really interesting. It was cool because we have a, a really enthusiastic guide and who who could explain a lot of things to you and he was really excited that me and my family were very curious about these things too, but one of the things that he said that was really interesting. I said, okay, I go, why all the dudes have little dicks like what's going on with that? And he said that they believed that if you had a large penis, that large penises were a symbol of barbaric behavior and that these were crude or people and that to, to be thought to be a sophisticated person, you wanted a smaller penis. So they actually accentuated smaller penises in their gods and smaller penises in their statute.

Speaker 1:          01:56:42       And that's funny. I mean, you can see these kinds of things all the time. So early pre western contact. Uh, if you look At japanese women, they're pins, they're painted with their eyes as narrow of a slit as possible post western contact. Now the women want more almond shaped eyes and so they start painting them with the beautiful women have bigger eyes. These things can change all over the map. I personally suspect that large penis size is also a product of sexual selection. So it's more fun for her if he's got a larger penis, they're having sex for longer and more regularly because is hidden. So he has to be available at the time. So she has to be available all the time or the system doesn't work and that's what creates pair bonding. So humans copulating for a very long period of time. If you compare this to the other primates with the single exception of bonobos and we have way bigger penises than any of the other great apes and I suspect that that's something that is female. I mean women. I would say why are men so obsessed with the penis size? But I suspect that there the creator of it and that's why we're so obsessed with it.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       Women who say that are playing games, they know that's ridiculous. I don't know that they are. they're definitely playing games. That's like men who are saying, why are women so obsessed with big breasts? We don't even care. I've never met a guy who said that. Some some asshole out there that's playing games. Okay. Possibly. You're right. It is fascinating when you think about all these different things that lead to natural selection and the fact that there's so many variables that are in place and that we're trying to find out what is better and what is not. And if you have a study and this study finds genetic differences and ethnic genetic differences there, there's, there's a lot of blowback and a lot of pushback against.

Speaker 1:          01:58:18       There will be. And, and one of the interesting things that we do know is if you think about how homosapiens evolved in africa and a small percentage of us left, which means the majority of us didn't, right? I mean there's few randoms who lived up in the top right hand corner, we're available to go, which means that all the rest of the earth comes out of a few small percentage of the population that could have left. And so we now know there's enormous genetic variation

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       within africa, way more genetic variation within africa than outside of africa. Then between any two people are chinese person in a norwegian prison are much more closely related to each other genetically then an african guy who lives in the next village over. And because most of the genetic variability never left the continent. And so we had this idea of race as if it has genetic meaning and it doesn't. But ethnicity does have genetic meaning, right? So an ethnic group evolved in a very certain spot to deal with very certain problems and their body shape will vary and you've got these west africans or a really jacked with these big muscle, a lot of quick jerk musculature. You don't see that over on east africa very much. Um, you've got a tall people in Denmark you don't see that, you know, in other parts of europe, etc. So people are the adaptation with the nun to deal with the cold climate.

Speaker 2:          01:59:31       Exactly. Also, and lots of that sanitation and a lot of that's just random genetic drift, a founder population, the other causes that aren't evolved but nonetheless have a big impact on what the population ends up looking like. It's just so amazing to consider that this entire species essentially, except for the times that We interacted with, uh, interbred with neanderthals came from one part of africa, you know, that's one of the reasons why racism is so preposterous because we're essentially all africans. We are all africans. We've all of us who are out have a little bit of other stuff in the us, but just a tiny bit, which, so weird though. We're so, we're so much like dogs, you know, like a great dane can breed with a poodle. They DoN't look Anything like each other. So were from another planet. You go, well that's definitely true.

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       or that's not gonna happen. It's like if you looked at lebron james and um, you know, traci lords, right? They look like two different things. They really do. And I suspect that when we ran into neanderthals were like, oh, she's kind of interesting looking, sort of hot, sort of different. And so it, you know, first of all we know humans will copulate with almost anything that old, stale. Yeah. And things that aren't even alive. Things that aren't alive. Things, the things that they probably shouldn't be, et cetera. But the end athol ones are interesting because really they are cousins. They're cousins separated by a million years and some change. And um, and if we don't know too much about them either, which is really weird, we know they had larger brains than us, but we don't really know how smart they were now. And, and, and why did we replace them?

Speaker 2:          02:00:54       Yeah. Like did we, was it diseases we carry that wiped them all out, was it we were better organized. So we got rid of, we all competed them. We killed them on purpose, you know, if there's a million branch species, we happen to know a lot about neanderthals because they are existed until very recently. But wHat we do, there's all sorts of branching that took place early on, lots of different australopithecines, et cetera. All those are dead ends and you know, the fact that we're the only one that comes out of that could mean, well we got lucky or were me in this shit and we took care of all of our cousins who didn't, you know, we wanted what they had. I think the ladder. Yeah. Probably a bit of both mean. Well, I mean that doesn't make sense. That were mean to shit a million years ago. We're mean, Shit. Exactly, and what's so interesting is, you know, this is something that coming back to the point I was making earlier about us cooperating, so we evolved

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       to cooperate with each other, but the key is we did not evolve to cooperate across different groups, so once you get to homo erectus and now you've got division of labor and you've got the capacity to plan for unfilled needs, right, where they're carrying these issue lean tools with them over great distances, et cetera. Well now who's your most effective predator? The occasional mammoth or saber tooth tiger will have killed the occasional one of us, but they can't possibly take us on the same way we can take them on. There's only one other thing on the planet that can take us on and that's ourselves. So other groups of homo erectus would have probably been a major threat. Certainly by the time we're homo sapiens, other groups would have been our only major threat, and so we evolved to be kind to each other within our group, but we did not evolve to be kind outside our group.

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       That doesn't mean we evolved to be mean. We evolved to be neutral, so let's see if you're going to be friend or foe and um, and that neutrality, super important. It has the potential for cooperation across group boundaries. We can change women and men can mingle so we don't interbreed too much amongst ourselves. We can trade with each other. Lots of good things can happen. But the second you guys get a little bit aggro with us, you know, now we're in a position to just go all out and try to exterminate you. And so rang him as he's great data. Richard wrangham, same catching fire guy shows that if you look at the rates of violence within human groups compared to chimps to like 500 times more violent, physically aggressive than we are, you look at the rates between human groups equal, they're the one to one ratio. So we tend to think about, well, how could it be that we're both so nice and so mean, but we have to remember that we evolved to cooperate and to be nice to each other, to be more effective killers. It wasn't because let's make a hippie paradise. It's like, shit, these lines are going to eat as you and I got to have to get together to sort out these guys, and so our cooperative nature is literally the flip side of the coin of our competitive violent killings.

Speaker 3:          02:03:24       Nature. Also the undeniable history of unbelievably ruthless tribal warfare would indicate that we have a long history of fighting against others that are like us that we don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:03:36       Absolutely. When when hunter gatherers meet each other and they do come into conflict, which is a huge percentage of the time, they literally fight to the death because if you capture me, you're going to torture me to death. If I'm female, you're gonna. Incorporate it into your system and then it's going to be okay. Not great, but okay, but if I'm male, I'm going to die so I might as well die fighting you now because I'm going to die on pleasantly later and that's super common. That's everywhere we see it and there's tons and tons of bodies that are healthily perforated that are the clearly the consequences of this kind of wharf.

Speaker 3:          02:04:06       Crazy that is thought to be even in 2018 and inevitable part of being human being, I mean warfare even to this day is thought to be inevitable because there's no, I mean we would all love that one day there'll be no warfare, but there's no indication whatsoever that that's taken

Speaker 1:          02:04:22       not almost there and I actually, I think pinker has got the best answer to this question which is basically, well, what structures do you need to put in place to make the world a safer and less violent place? And, and I don't knoW if you've talked to him about his book better angels of our nature. I know you've talked to him about more recent ones, but

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       yes. Better angels is a great example. It's a great book. It's a great example of how we become less and less violent and even over our lifetimes. And, and part of that is undoubtedly better governance structure and all that. But part of that I think is cycles on itself. So when I was a little kid, and this kind of thing probably happened to you, I was on when I was in kindergarten, the guy who drove our car pool was a cop. So this cop is driving me home in the back of his car. Now he's got no seat belts because this is 1969 and cars don't have seat belts, right. Big bench seat and a buick or something. And we'd come around a corner and they all slide up against me to the edge of the car seat and I'm trying to push back. But I'm this little guy, right?

Speaker 2:          02:05:14       And I can't. Then I hit the, I mUst have hit my elbow against the door, flies open. I rolled out of the car. Oh my god. And I go bouncing across the street. Right. So he's, you know, he's not going to arrive home empty handed. So of course he goes and retrieves me from the ditch and he brings me home, shows my mum and I'm bleeding and bruised and torn shIrt and you know, like you'd expect from bouncing out of a car. And my mom who's a pediatrician. So she could tell I wasn't badly damaged. It looks to me over and says, hi, he looks fine. Don't worry about it. Can you? Can you imagine somebody brought your kid home? Said, hey man, I'm really sorry joe. Your daughter fell out the car and bounced across the street to a throttle them. It'd be freak out and that's not that long ago either. No, this is 1969 when you and I are both on this planet and so what I think is part of what's what pinker's documenting is as the world gets safer, we start getting used to a low mayhem world and these, these mayhem event stand out in our minds and so it actually self perpetuates where the safer it gets, the safer we needed to be because every little thing that goes wrong stands out in sharper relief.

Speaker 3:          02:06:11       Very fascinating way Of looking at it. You know what's interesting to me about pinker's work is how much pushback he gets and particularly about the world being a safer place. Like people want to keep putting pointing towards violent episodes and and racism and crime and all these different things is different factors as if it's some sort of evidence against what he's saying when he's incorporating that, those Current events into this large database. And he's saying yes, it's not that we don't live in utopia, but the woRld is vastly safer and better now than it was a thousand years ago or 10,000 years ago or even 100 years ago or even if there's. Why is there so much pushback

Speaker 2:          02:06:53       against this. So the thing is, I think what's going on as that people worry that it doesn't look like a problem to be solved anymore. Right? So when you. When our kids, we both have lots of gay friends, but we didn't know it because they're not telling anybody because someone's going to kick their ass if they knew that they were gay. Now, yes, gay people are still discriminated against, but it's so much better than it was then. What you don't want to. What I think people are advocates don't want to say as well, there's no problem anymore because then you can allow them to still run into troubles in various circumstances. Even though the trouble they run into today is a thousand times less than the trouble they ran into and read little same thing holds for racism. Same thing holds for sexism. They've all gotten so much better, but and sexual violence is a perfect example.

Speaker 2:          02:07:33       You know if you look at, if you set, this is in pinker's book, if you set rape and homicide to you call it both of them, whatever level they are in 1970 to 100 and then you track them through to the early two thousands on homicide is in the uS. homicides dropped down to like 50 rapes dropped down to like 25, but if you listen to women's advocacy groups about campus sexual assault and stuff, you'd never know that and the reason you wouldn't know it is because people worry. Well, if you think the problem's getting better on its own, then you won't keep doing anything to help fix it. And that's a really unfortunate part of our psychology because it makes people feel like there's been no progress and when you feel like there's no progress, then you think, well maybe we need to completely overturn the whole system and try something new.

Speaker 2:          02:08:13       And that's of course the point of pinker's newest book, enlightenment. Now no things are going fricking great. Turning anarchy and all of those things are really bad ideas. Voting for somebody like trump's a really bad idea because things are actually running along really nicely. It's just that we tend to forget it because every advocacy group who's all worried about whatever their particular issue is, doesn't want the word to get out that things are a lot better than they used to be. Because I think at some fundamental level they think, well, 25 grapes here isn't bad enough. We better say that there's 100 or you know, I'm not saying they do this consciously, but of course 25 reps here, whatever the number is, is bad enough. Right? It doEsn't. It doesn't have to be the numbers that it used to be when I was a child to be a problem at all.

Speaker 2:          02:08:50       That has to be as a number above zero. Well, there seems to. The people develop this vested interest in promoting an idea and they want to exaggerate that idea. Whatever it is, whether it's the idea that the world is a safer place than it actually is, or whether it's the world as an idea of a more dangerous, more dangerous place and it really is and for whatever reason, once we have it in our mind that this is the thing we're married. Two were married to this concept of polyamorous life and that this is a natural way to live or that you know, violence is inevitable and then this is just a part of who we are. We tend to promote that and we tend to have massive confirmation bias and it's, it's. I think it's because we personally associate ourselves with ideas. We don't look at ideas as being a thing.

Speaker 2:          02:09:35       Like if you think that something is one way and then you're pointed towards evidence that you're incorrect, you feel like personally you've been slighted, or your being somehow, somehow you're being diminished by your lack of being. Correct, but you're incorrect assumptions and notions. You're absolutely right. That is a weird part of being a person. It's a very weird part of it being a person. It's the hardest part about being a scientist because every good scientist is wrong all the time. I've been wrong already on your show. Right? And so it's super hard to admit it because by human nature you just want. You want. My immediate reaction is to fight against it and not say, well, hold on. What's joe saying? No, he's right. I overstated that. Let's back off. Right? And so there's this really lovely paper that came out in 2011 by mercier and dan sperber, and what they argued is, I think they nailed it and they said, here's what it is. Our Brain actually evolved our logical processing abilities not to find out the truth of the world, but to convince you of my point of view. And so with oUr logical abilities evolved in

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       service of persuasion, not in service of seeking out the truth, because of course, if I can persuade you that the world is the way it would in a way that benefits bill, that the world is something about the way bill wants the world to be is true, then the world's going to be a little kinder to me. It'll fit my worldview and others will give me the things I want. And so I go through life trying to persuade you of my worldview rather than trying to find out what's actually out there. And so that's why you think, oh well smart people are going to fall for that. No smart. It doesn't matter how smart you are, you, you're using whatever brain power you have. Not defined the truth, but rather to find evidence for your particular point of view. Well, I think, I think it's also a byproduct of ignorance because for the longest time you could tell me something and there was very little way that I could find out whether or not your writer, I really couldn't.

Speaker 4:          02:11:19       No, you're correct. Unless I went and started doing research and read some books and whereas now I could just pull up my phone and say, hey, bill just said this, is that right? And then the phone wIll go, no, there's been 100 different studies that show that, and you go, oh look, motherfucker, I got the stats. That's true, and that definitely matters a lot. It's this awesome democratization of knowledge, but if that really were all that it was, then everybody would agree on their politics. Everybody would agree that the fake news was fake and the real news was real. Not necessarily because this is a fairly recent invention, but what I'm getting at is that I think that the ability to be deceptive was perhaps there was an evolutionary advantage. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, so that's one of the very first thing that happens when you have theory of mind, because as soon as I realized the contents of your mind differ from the contents of my own, I say, oh, I can plant something in joe's mind that'll help me.

Speaker 4:          02:12:10       That ain't true, but if he believes it is, life will be better for me. And so as soon as kids learn theory of mind, at age four, they start to lie. And prior to theory of mind, they tell the truth when it's like, where are you playing? Hide and seek. I'm right here, dad. You're supposed to keep quiet. But they can't because they don't understand that you don't know the same things. They know, right? Yeah. And they also understand that they could perhaps change the way you feel about them by manipulating the truth relating information. It's what's weird is having kids and seeing kids grow up and troubled homes. One, one thing you see almost universally is, are those kids lie a lot, you know, because you're in the no choice condition, right? Yeah. You're in a bad spot. And like one of my daughter's little friends is constantly lying, but you know, she has a broken home and the situation's not good and it's just, it's unfortunate. But this little kid is tormented because of it. She's always making stuff up and all the other little girls roll their eyes and they know she's a liar and it's. IT's sad. But the ability to be deceptive, I feel like that, you know this, there's some sort of idea that we cling to that if you can deceive someone about certain particular aspects of your mind or your past or what you've, what you've accomplished or what you're capable of doing, that you will have a better place in the social chain. No, that's absolutely

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       right. And so the way I think about it is think about the difference between conspecific conflicts, conflicts between members of the same species and conflicts between predator and prey. So every time predator and prey interact, eventually one of them's going to die. Your editor's going to starve, praise going to get eaten, right? But when conspecifics members of the same species interact more, competing over something, even if it's a very subtle level of competition, we don't want to come to blows because if I'm trying to size you up, be it physical blows or mental blows. We suffering on both sides. If we have to do get out. And so I want to sell myself as being a little more than I really am. I want to be bill plus 20 percent. And you want to say yourself as a little more than you really are, because we know that we're not fully going to test each other because there's negative consequences for testing and whenever this negative consequences, even for the winter for testing, there's a lot of posturing that's going to go on and that posturing is something that's literally built into our psyche and we go through life trying to sell from flight on average.

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       Not already does this, but on average trying to sell as much as we can in order to gain the things in life that we might not get if we're brutally honest about what our capabilities actually are.

Speaker 3:          02:14:36       Fascinating that we cling to all of these ancient structures that are in place when it comes to the way we interact with each other and how important is the social exchanges that we have and that I think this is one of the reasons why we cling to ideas so much that these ideas, if you can push an idea through, you've got some sort of points

Speaker 1:          02:14:56       board. Yep. Got points on the board and probably your ideas on average are going to benefit you and my days on average benefit me and so if I'm, if I'm happily married in a monogamous relationship and I'm not looking around within monogamy's, the great thing and sleeping around is a sin, but if I'm, if I'm single and I've got opportunities, well then I probably hold alternative views. So on average our views not perfectly, but on average our views serve as well and if I can plant my views in your mind and I've benefited.

Speaker 3:          02:15:23       yeah, I saw that a lot. I mean, do you see that a lot with everything, but I guess more what we're talking about people that don't want to admit like what about when it comes to like pinker's data about the world being a better place because they have almost a vested interest in stirring up fear and that they're committed in their mind. They're committed to constantly studying the wrongs of the world and the evil of the world and that any sort of diminishing of that is actually going to cause harm to the people that are suffering. So I think they have a good perk in their mind. There's good intention,

Speaker 1:          02:16:00       I totally agree, and the data are consistent with their strategies because on average fear appeals and anger appeals work a whole lot better than, hey man, things are great. Donate to this cause and we'll keep them great. That doesn't work at all. It doesn't work at all. And so when, when viagra was invented in 1989, my little brother and I were chatting about it and we thought, you know this, I'll save some animals because there's a lot of animals that are consumed for their presumed potency affects by like traditional chinese medicine consumers and things like that. And so we thought, boy, if I ever actually works prior to viagra and nothing is out there that works up at this 11 impact. And so we wrote this little letter off, send it to a journal and said, you know that this is going to save certain animals like seals, which they could be harvested to eat their penises.

Speaker 1:          02:16:41       Canadian seals. I know a minute what? I know people that you're allowed to kill a certain number. You can't kill the seals in America, they're protected, but in Canada, us, but in Canada you can, there's a hood seal, eliminate allow men and a harp seal allotment, and so people were killing up to their allotments and selling. You could do it solely for the penis and sell the penis for enough money to make your money back. Now, what purpose does the seals penis have beyond the seals? Original purpose. Zilch. Right? But they eat it because it's supposed to make you more potent, satisfied as a rhino horn rhino horn as an example. That's used for lots of different things so it's less likely to be helped, but the seal penis is only, you know, people basically only using it for its potency. And then when fire comes along, like literally you're shopping in the supermarket where you could have by, you're going to get, I'll have some ceo peanuts or I'll take a viagra. Well, we just said people are going to switch. We were greeDy. You throw both of them to try them both. And. And people did actually. But, but we, we made this argument and we literally were attacked by the world wildlife fund government looking at plan to revive seal peanuts. What hold the fuck on is this recent? It was updated, was published in 2015, but it was updated. This may

Speaker 3:          02:17:47       what the government is looking at a plan, go back up to revive seal penis sales. Okay. This must be a plan was brought to the government. This must not be the worst way of like looking at that headline is that the government's thinking, man, we got to fucking revive these penis sales. No one's buying.

Speaker 1:          02:18:09       Because they actually may be thinking that because you got some relatively impoverished people are hunting for them and no one's buying them anymore. So if you're not going to. Well, if you're not going to reveal the report drafted by the for institute. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker 3:          02:18:22       Aimed at creating new markets to support an earlier proposal to kill a hundred and 40,000 gray seals over five years in the southern gulf of st laurence. Seventy percent of gray seals that frequent the area so that what they want to do is they want to diminish the. Okay, here's what it is. They have long complained that the growing population of gray seals is to blame for eating too many commercially viable fish, which has resulted in repeated calls for a call. Okay, so they want to kill the seals. So to save the fish market, so they're going to get people to buy dick.

Speaker 1:          02:18:54       Right? So They make it financially viable.

Speaker 3:          02:18:56       Look at this. This is racist. The penises have juvenile adult animals may be dried and sold as sexual enhancement products, particularly the asian buyers.

Speaker 1:          02:19:04       Well, that's because it's not meant to be racist is because in traditional chinese medicine, the seal penis was used as a potency product. I understand, but the target, those agents, those poor fools, but they're not portfolios anymore because you know what? They switched. So we wrote this paper and literally the world wildlife fund attacks tax us and I did not see that coming. Right? I thought, boy, the world wildlife fund is going to be psyched because here's some good news for a change. But they don't. Good news, they only

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       want bad news because people pay and they do what they can to fix things when it's bad news and they forget that you got to have some good news along the way or people give up. Look at this list says here, asian consumers, particularly athletes also consume a beverage called. How do you say that? Dallas shen oral liquid that is made from seal penis and testicles, which they believe to be energizing and performance enhancing. How about some studies? motherfucker, before you start eating sealed dick's, try it. See a. No, don't need that. Check it. Why would you take that one? You can get fucking viagra. Exactly. Guarantee a viagra is better. It is. I mean if it's not better, it's good enough. Like what are you trying to do? So. So we actually, because we got attacked by the world wildlife fund, we sent a, one of my graduate student from Hong Kong, we descend them to go back to Hong Kong for the holidays to go back to you.

Speaker 2:          02:20:19       The world wildlife fund, because they said that were wrong. people won't switch. They say, what? How would, how did they phrase it where they wrote an article? They rebutted us and they said, no, no, our data show, when we tried to get people to switch from ryan, oh, and tiger horn to aspirin, they wouldn't. And so they want sprint so they won't switch to viagara. And I'm like, look, I think fire is different from aspirin. I got a headache, I take an aspirin. So yeah, I think my headache got better faster than it would have otherwise. A little bit vague. You need a viagra, you take it. You're like, yep, that sucker worked right. There's visual evidence and so we argue that it's different. And so we actually went into these clinics and we asked people in traditional chinese clinics in Hong Kong, what do you take for a headache?

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       What do you take for gout? What do you take for rectal dysfunction? And that was the one case where they'd switched. So consumers all over the world, they know when a pro, a better product comes along. They know when they've got no options. Like what? You might as well eat seals, penis because that's as good as anything or because nothing works. Maybe you'll get a little bit of a placebo effect or you know. Oh, hey, look, there's something that actually works. That's what I'm going to buy. What I read about the. One of the issues with rhino horn with some asian buyers is that also it's a. It's a signal of affluence. That's exactly right. Yeah. It's prestige purchase, so sad. It is sad as shit ever because that is such a crazy animal bizarre creature that almost seems like a living dinosaur it looks at and we're losing them left and right now because people are killing them for their fucking horn, which just basically just collagen fingernail.

Speaker 2:          02:21:44       Yeah. It's bananas. IT just doesn't make any sense to me that that is still, that they haven't realized that there's no value in it, that there's no physical value. It doesn't really give you erections and fever, fever. It's got to have a long list unfortunately, and then they're still buying it and they're. And they're buying it again for athletes like they get a kick. Exactly. It's like buying a maserati. Wow. That's so crazy. That's so sad. Oh, my daughter's outside the door. Hi. Get out of here. You bothering us? Um, yeAh. It's so strange to me that there are these specific cases, right? Like, it's not like people are looking for a giraffe horns like funny is they're looking for rhino horn. Like what do you think that they made an association like, damn, if I was jack liquor wine, oh this chick's like, man, I need to get that horn and eat it.

Speaker 2:          02:22:35       And my dick get hard. Like I do think so because if you look at the long list of products, they look pretty phallic and mostly people he'd phallic things in order to gain potency. Is there something crazy about seal dicks? Like what's going on with decently sized? Decent. A good word for that. I like that. And so you know, you think, oh that sucker, I'll get big too. Right? We're so weird. But it's so weird that in the face of new evidence that people haven't adopted this new evidence and they still clean it. At least some people claim to. But here's the thing. So our, our pre modern ancestors didn't understand germs at all, right? There was no way they could have. It's such a bizarre idea that something that small could kill you, but they did know that if I touched you when you were sick, I might end up sick too.

Speaker 2:          02:23:16       And that seems almost like a magical transference. And if you accept this and they all know that, like they, they'll, they'll shy away. We all evolve. chimpanzees will shy away from disgusting stuff and open source and people really. Yeah, absolutely. if you get the right kinds of illness that, that manifests, that you're seriously outwardly sick and contagious, people find it disgusting. And so that kind of magical contagion. It's super easy to see why. Well then it make you think that while ryan and warren will make my dick bigger too. Yeah, I guess, I mean, are there any instances where that stuff is real where it does actually work that way? Not that I, I can't think of any, but it is the case that, that you, you being sick Will make me sick. No question, but nothing that like you eat and animals thing you consume.

Speaker 2:          02:24:00       No, but If it is the case, imagine that, that like after you and I chat you said, hey, bill here, have my jacket, and now I go out with your jacket on. And people go, oh man, he's got joe rogan jacket, he's cool and now I've got a little bit of your cool and now the girls are like me too. LIke when hercules put the lion's head on the head over and the lions thing on it that you, you kicked some ass to have that thing. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I guess, you know, it's just, we're so weird, you know, just uh, the human animal itself is just such a strange thing and the more you study it, the more you go deeper and deeper into the layers of weirdness that we are. And psychology is pretty good about finding out. Our average weirdnesses were not so good at finding out they're really unusual weirdnesses because we can't predict that one out of a thousand behavior very well.

Speaker 2:          02:24:49       We can predict what people tend to do when the bell curves tend to split. We can't say what some random psycho or genius or artist or whatever we'll do under those circumstances because that's not what our models are designed for. You know, it's um, it, it's so interesting when you think about our interactions also with all the various animals that we've come up come across like all, all throughout our, our, our life as human beings and that people have chosen some to, some to cherish and some to, some to take on as food sources and some to worship and, and, and often it makes good sense. So dogs are great because we have great vision though. Our noses and ears don't work very well. If we could have somebody around who could hear and smell well and is on our side, that's a huge plus, right?

Speaker 2:          02:25:35       It's worth feeding that thing or at least tolerating it and they need some scraps. And some of them cats, you know, they're annoying. They don't like you, but they're good at killing rats and other vermin that would, once we were agriculturalists, those kind of vermin would have been a real problem. They'd have been largely irrelevant when we're still hunter gatherers, but so we had dogs. We domesticated those while we were hunter gatherers, but cat's the best I know is like ancient Egypt and these, these societies and in that storing grain and things like that. So those ancient systems make good sense that you're making a deal with an animal that can achieve something that you can't achieve and of course you're living in a world without chemicals and machines and all that kind of stuff, but tons of them are just totally random. And in this culture that thing is a worshiped in this culture.

Speaker 2:          02:26:14       It's eaten and you know, and that, that sort of stuff is super hard to predict. Now in studying all this stuff and writing this book, how much has this changed the way you just see humans? Like as you're just going to the mall, it does change it, right? So you see, like I, I remember being proud of my son when he told a lie because I was like, oh good I made and so we're in the, we're in the playground and this little boys playing with him and my son doesn't have a lunchbox at all. He doesn't own one and the little boy says I got a spiderman lunchbox and my son is like four, four and a half. And he looks at the kid and he doesn't know spiderman. It's because he hasn't seen the show yet. But he knows it's obvious. The kids bragging.

Speaker 2:          02:26:51       It's obviously something good. And he goes, yeah, I got a grasp man. And a leaf man lunchbox. Nobody. He just made the shit up, right? Because spiders, right? The spiderman or a grasp and he's looking around for other things. Right? And so I was actually proud of it because it showed a. He's got theory mind down, he knows what the kid can and can't know. And b, he knows that telling these stories are gonna be important for his place in the social hierarchy. So the kid looks at me and I'm like, trying not to laugh, right, because I got to support my son and he's like, really? And I'm like, damn right kid. And so you can imagine that it, without this background, you might say, look, we should discourage this kind of lying, but it gives you a little bit of a different perspective on it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:31       It also probably weird because you, you know, your kid realizes, yeah, my dad's got my back. Like, well that's good to know. Thanks bro. Exactly. And then she'd always have your kids back. Yeah. But grass man and leaf man, you got to pull them aside. Like, dude, you gotta come up with an animal to try to do something that's got. Well congrats man. Actually do. Besides photosynthesize by cow. Exactly. But he was on the spur of the moment and he's only four. So I decided it was good enough. You know, that that is also cattle worshiping is very fascinating to um, the uh, like the hindus and all these different, different tribes and different cultures that were shipped cattle were other people just thought of them as food sources. Right? And so again, now I don't know the origins that, but you could imagine a system whereby, well if you keep cattle and you benefit from them rather than eating them, you're going to get some gains from that. And we do know when you shift from being a hunter

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       gatherer to basically kill in an eaton stuff, to being a pastoralist, so your cattle or sheep or whatever or to being a farmer, you suddenly have to start taking on the long game. So humans are perfectly capable of envisioning unfelt needs no matter what kind of society they're in. But hunter gatherers they're living for today and so it's, it's kill it, you know, hunted, shared out amongst all of us. And then we eat it and then we'll worry about tomorrow when it comes along. Well, once you shift to having herds or having land, you can't. That psychology doesn't work anymore. And so what's super interesting is it took literally like 10 or 20,000 years we've got the implements in place to be agricultural is, but we're not planting and it just, we're just grinding stuff that we gather. And why did it take so long to plant when maybe it was, whether, maybe it was a bunch of things, but part of it is you have to shift your psychology over and say, all right, I got to stop thinking about eating, killing and eating it today.

Speaker 1:          02:29:11       I got to say, well, all right, well would it be beneficial to me to keep this beast around and have it for tomorrow and drink it's blood or it's milk or whatever. And one way to get there might have been, well let's create a religion that says we can't eat them today because that'll solve it immediately. Right. That's one way to look at it. But have you ever looked into some of the other hypothesis on the origin of cattle worship? I think it again has to do with psilocybin because. Oh, that could be too. That'd be totally cool. Grown cow shit. And that'd be totally cool. And not only that, but it would because it has benefits so like societies can do anything they want, right. And there's some crazy systems that they do in a lot of those are really bad ideas. There's sources of infection and disease and death and those societies tend not to grow, but societies that do things that happened to be good ideas, even if they got it from mushrooms and things like that, those are going to really pass along.

Speaker 1:          02:29:58       And so you've got a lot of people on this planet to worship cows, which suggests that whatever got that started actually probably had a benefit because those societies grew and worshiping god, not something like when you come to me and say, hey man, I worship cows and I'm thinking, okay, I, I'd rather eat them, but fine. It's hard to imagine being persuaded, but it's easy to imagine growing up in that system over imitating, right? We talked about that. You automatically just copy to add warships, cows, things are working out well for him, I'll do the same. And then you've got. And that's a good thing for your society too because you can drink. It's blood or it's milk or whichever you're lactose tolerant, whatever you do, and then that allows you to society to grow. Was there anything surprising to you in writing this book and researching it and putting it together?

Speaker 1:          02:30:40       Was there anything that really just had made you step back and go, wow, I didn't see that one common look. There's a lot of things that I didn't see coming and a lot of times where I thought I had an idea of how it all worked and then I thought I would read a lot more papers and like, oh, that's not even possible. They didn't have that capability or whatever. What surprised me was that I. A big part of where this book comes from is that then colleagues would say they would know I'm working on this, and they'd say, well, come give a talk at my conference on leadership, and I'd say, well, I don't know anything about leadership nickel. Well, surely something. It must have implications for that, and every time they asked me to do that, you know, I'd say, okay, I'll give it a try.

Speaker 1:          02:31:15       And then literally you sit down and you think about it, you realize, wow, there are important implications for leadership or innovation or happiness or sociality and I never saw them coming. And so it was literally friends of mine kind of forced. I had one goal which is to just understand social intelligence and how did we become so socially intelligent and the. And that was where I started in friends just kept asking me to look at other things. And every time I did there was an answer. Sometimes it was an answer that is easier to find. It seems harder to find, but it was always there. And what that tells me is that there's really a lot of value in taking the anthropology and the biology and putting them together and saying, all right, where did we come from? And now what can that tell us about who we are today? That's an interesting.

Speaker 3:          02:31:53       It's sort of a intellectual exercise to write a different perspective on the material that you're going over. And if somebody forces you into a little box, like tell me what you know, what's the influence on or what the impact on creativity or what's the impact on leadership or all these different things just to give you a different view. Let's look at it from the left. Let's look at it from the top. So I'll get it from below.

Speaker 1:          02:32:18       And that's what's so fun about sciences. You can say, all right, well let's see if it tells us anything that either we already know is true and now we could get new things that we would know about it or if it tells us something that we don't even know, but that might explain the way the world is and both of those are valuable because then you can run off and try to test them and a lot of dead ends. I mean that's what science is all about, but some of them will hopefully not be dead ends and you have runoff and test and say, holy shit, now I understand innovation. Now I understand whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:32:41       Well, what's interesting about this kind of material is that it gives you, to me as an individual, it gives me insight in my own behavior and I think it would do a lot of people do all of us some real good if we had a better understanding of what our motivations are and how we got to this point in civilization, what we actually are, you know, I mean maybe it will or won't change your behavior, but at least it will give you some insight into.

Speaker 1:          02:33:09       I totally agree. And the thing is that when I find myself getting upset because you disagree with me about something trivial or even important like politics or something and it takes a second, you got stumped. Say, hold on, I don't have any privilege. Access to the right way to do things right? And so the fact that you care more about x and I care more about why it doesn't mean that you're an evil person and must be overcome. It means that probably we ought to be talking to each other and trying to find a compromise solution that makes things work best. But there's this automatic instead I think that you are evil, absolutely with me. And so the beauty of this kind of, the more you know about this stuff in the past and our evolutionary origins, the more you know that literally we've evolved to do that because if we didn't do that, we're screwed, but now we don't need to anymore. And so now we can say, well, hold on, I'm a lefty and you're in my example. You're a righty and we disagree about this particular president, but a fine. Let's see if we can both agree on a goal that will make both of us happy rather than, no, you're evil and all I have to do is overcome you.

Speaker 3:          02:34:02       One of the things that I've really tried very hard from doing this podcast is to not be attached to ideas and to do that as an exercise. And I think over the course of the years I've been doing this, I've gotten way, way better at that, but it's just so fascinating. I encounter in the raw form, like when I go to a party and I just run into some guy who's a dad and he brings something up and I tell them, well, that's not totally true because of this, and then you see this. The blood starts pumping, the heart starts beating and they're trying to look at some way you're wrong and it becomes a personal thing. It gets very, very heated

Speaker 1:          02:34:37       and it's easy for all of us to do that in my job and your job is the same. It's to say, okay, is it time to abandon this idea? Is there a time the defendant and when I was young and an academic, there was no way I was abandoning. That was last quarter. it was going to do is defense, so you attack me and I marshall everything I can and I try to attack you back. And it was some of my colleagues were like, hey man, you know when you're wrong, it's cool. That's what science is. And I'm like, ah, you're right. You're right. I've got to start. And so now, even though I love the give and take of academics and I love to argue about stuff I tried really, really hard to keep in my mind. Well what if what You're saying right now is right. Rather than trying to just attack it, which is my automatic instinct to say, well, what is it that you're saying now might be a value that I should actually be incorporating and not trying to stomp on.

Speaker 3:          02:35:19       Yeah. And also just the ideas aren't you exactly. Your you and these ideas are just something that you're tossing around

Speaker 1:          02:35:26       beach ball. Exactly rIght. And that's super hard to keep in mind because everything that, that we come to own, we get attached to. And if I tend to have my ideas because they tend to make the world a more hospitable place to bill. And in a way I kind of do need to defend them because if you convince me no, the way the world should work is whoever is strongest gets everything while I'm stuffed. And so I need to try to fight against a lot of alternative views. And, and I have to overcome that in my effort to find what the right answer is as well. So it's, it makes good sense that our ideas are like possessions, that we have attitudes toward our ideas, just like we have toured the objects that we own, that means something to us, to our family, to our group, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          02:36:02       That all makes really good sense. And the other side of that coin is if we talking about the way things used to be in a premedical world, if you're the chances of you carrying different pathogens and I carry is reasonably high and if you infect me, I'm screwed. Now if you do tHings differently than I do think so you eat this food and I eat that. Food was different. Could actually be wrong from my perspective because if I do what you've done, I'm like get myself sick because you've adapted to that, that thing. And so we literally probably for good evolutionary reasons, came to view cultural ways of doing things that are different as if they're wrong. Because that saved us, that protected us from the kind of pathogen vectors that you've gotten adapted to, but that I haven't. That's fascinating. So that this is almost like ingrained in us. Well, as we've evolved to be this way and so it's hard to undo that.

Speaker 3:          02:36:50       Do you think that with the access to information that we're currently enjoying that because there's so much information now and it's so easy to get to that perhaps there'll be more instances of people not becoming attached to their ideas and recognizing that they are there. They are separate the you are just to thinking organism and what the facts are and what reality is is just something that's happening and you don't

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       have to be personally attached to it. It's not a part of your identity. I hope so because in an ideal world we could have the things that were attached to that don't really matter. I'm an iphone guy and you're an android, but who cares? Right. We cOuld argue about it. It'd be silly and have time. Exactly. We could still be friends and all that, and then we could win something that mattered and know this, this political strategy will make everyone poor or sick or whatever. Then We could be willing to change their minds because in the end i think we've got this evolved desire to latch on to these things, these ideas and values and um, and products even and all that. And so it'd be nice if we could do it with the trivial and let the stuff that really matters. Guide rna by its accuracy. Well, it'd be also nice if that.

Speaker 2:          02:37:58       The stuff that we do with trivial, it's, it stays actually trivial because there's so many people will, I guess it goes with sports teams and. but it also goes with like brands of cars. Like I've heard people say, I've always been a ford guy. Love for. It's like, okay, yeah. It probably reminds you of the ford your dad drove or whatever I guess. But it's like I would never buy a chevy. I know. Really never. It's funny, isn't it? If the best fucking car was a chevy and you have the opportunity to buy it, you're like, no, no. I'm a ford guy. Like, right. What benefits? It's some strange reason. There's some weird motivation to stick to your initial statements. Yeah, so I think it's like oliver wendell holmes or someone who's had a foolish consistency is the hoBgoblin of small minds. Right? But we all have these consistencies because part of the problem Is if I move around with the wind, you look at me as I'm a [inaudible], right?

Speaker 2:          02:38:49       stand flop. If I can't stand by what I believe in, then you have no respect for me, but what if you. What if you. What you believe in is incorrect, right? That's how you play into that. That's where it gets real, right? So what you. Obviously what you ideally want is, here's my value structure and it's unchangeable and then negotiable. And yet when you show me that I'm in that my attitudes are impeding my own goals, then I'm willing to change them to achieve that value structure. And I think the best politicians and scientists and artists and comedians and all the rest of the ones who can do that. Well, yeah. Well I like what you said. Like here's my value structure. This is, these are my ethics, these are my morals, this is how I treat people, this is who I am. But all that other stuff is just information.

Speaker 2:          02:39:33       Yeah. It's all a means to an end. And so some people care a lot about loyalty. Other people care a lot about fairness. Other people care a lot about sanctity and purity, right? There's different values that are important. All of the world. We all care about them, but some people wait one set more important more than another set. John hyde, if you. I don't know if you've had him on your show, he does this work and he's one of the first people that push these ideas and you can predict them by people's politics and stuff like that. And so if we all agree, they all matter, but the problem is then we get into an argument where you tell me loyalty is more important than I tell you, fairness or harm is really important and then we're never going to see eye to eye and probabilities, you know, with two humans that are healthy. That's an interesting discussion

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       because why do you think fairness is more important and why do I think discipline is more important than fairness or education is more, or whatever it is. I think that when someone clings to this idea that this is the most significant aspect of human civilization, that's always weird and it's hard when they can't acknowledge other possibilities. Right? And some, and again, all of these things are, I hate to say it, but they're like 50 percent genetic, right? Some of us are more openminded and some of us are more closed minded and there's probably good reasons to be that way that made your, that made you successful under one set of circumstances versus another. Because you know, extroversion, for example, almost all people prefer extroverts or introverts, but extroverts are all sorts of risks for disease because they're constantly up in everyone's face and so an ancestral environment, so it was probably pretty costly to be extroverted and you paid a price in that introverts didn't have to pay when you got sick, but it's also like we gained so much creativity and insight from introverts course.

Speaker 1:          02:41:07       No, but, but, but at a social level, extroverts benefit introverts might benefit by then running microsoft and being the greatest artist and all that. And that's again, as we talked about this earlier, the beauty about being human is how many different ways you can achieve the same goal. What are your thoughts on the influence of epigenetics? Look at super interesting. So my, my. I know little about it, very little about it. My behavioral genetics colleague insist that there's no good evidence among humans for multigenerational epigenetic effects. We know that they exist now in some animals. We can do the experiments pretty easily to get these multigenerational epigenic epigenetic effect. Explain to people what we're talking about. Yeah. So epigenetics is basically you can turn genes on and off in the simplest sense, and so environmental factors will matter, like maybe when you're in utero there's a famine and that's a common thing that's looked at.

Speaker 1:          02:41:55       We'll look at that in rats, for example, will underfeed the mother when the baby's in there and that causes the baby's methylation of some of the jeans. I don't understand the science of it at all, but the turn some jeans on and some jeans off and so a baby of a of a mother rat who was raised who is in utero, when the mother was underfed will mature more rapidly. It'll eat everything that's not nailed down and it'll have sex with lots more rats than unregular than a rat that wasn't, that, didn't have it. Some other starved. And the key thing is that makes good sense because it's a way to respond to times of famine. Grow as fast as you can, reproduce as quickly as you can because you know reproductions of currency, of evolution, the fact that you exist and live is trivial.

Speaker 1:          02:42:34       The fact that you passed on your genes. That's what evolution works with, so it's a great way to change with the local environment and there's some very interesting evidence that then those effects are even in the next generation, so the child of a rat that was. That was in a mother who was underfed. We'll also have some of these strategies I think, believe they find that in humans as well. We all have suffered from famine. That's the argument, but none of the data. My behavioral genetics colleagues says none of those data are robust enough. It's sort of like some of the criticisms you made of what I've said and you're right, the data suggests things that might be, but there's lots of alternative explanations so we don't yet know it will get read as about longevity and that there was some sort

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       of evidence that points to the descendants of people who survived famine. They, they live longer. Right? And so the question might be why. So we know, for example, that if you're in utero, during famine, males are more likely to be aborted than females. When it gets really bad, female fetuses are probably more robust, but if you ignore that gender effect, in all probability, those fetuses that could survive in a mother during feminine might just be the more robust specimens. Right? and so you might just be calling out the people who wouldn't have lived as long and so it's super hard to, you know, you don't do experiments on these things in humans. You can do experiments in mice and rats and, and try to find these things out. The downside is, you know, if you've read about a million cancer drugs that are really going to help us and then they disappear.

Speaker 2:          02:43:57       It's because it works in a mouse and it doesn't work in us. And the downside of these things is even mice and rats differ from each other and so, and we're a long way from either of them and so the epigenetic effects, did they show? There may be good reasons why we don't, you know, there's some real ethical questions in regard to running studies like that on human being. Exactly. We're going to have to develop headless humans in a lab that have no soul, that we could do tests on what we could, but I actually think that what will get really good at is the issue you raised earlier and that is, I don't know everything that's ever happened to you, but some day it'll be possible to know a ton of that stuff and I'll be able to rule out all sorts of alternative causes and diet is a perfect example.

Speaker 2:          02:44:40       You guys talk about that a lot on this show. Well, how do we know that this particular collection of foods will actually do you any good? How do we know how well people are sticking to it? And a big part of those effects are actually the psychological effects. So protein is a really good example that you know, steve simpson argued in the early nineties that if you started with locus, that animals are motivated to eat as a function of how much protein that they've consumed. And so the atkins diet was the right idea, but a misunderstanding of the cause. It's just the protein. We evolved to feel full. When you get protein, we didn't evolve to feel full from carbohydrates and there's a host of reasons for that and there's a host of other effects that are going on at the same time, but the consequence of that is then when people's diets move around, you say, oh look, this diet is this affecting that one doesn't, but you don't actually know what they've been doing because some diets are harder to maintain and they're cheating more whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:45:26       Someday we'll have much better evidence and all of that. You'll be wearing a device. I'll know what you consumed. I'll know which aisle, an accelerometer on the wall, everything that happened to you. Well, that's another interesting aspect of genetics, right? There's one thing that we absolutely knows that some people respond differently to doris and other people do and you know, for some person a particular type of diet is beneficial and perfect and just locked in and other person. That'd be horrible. Yeah, absolutely. That's weird. You kNow, across the species I find that with dogs or. But it it at an ethnic level. That makes perfect sense because the people who have been eating different foods for a long period of time, I have to adapt to that and of course agriculture is only 12,000 years old total, although we've been eating cereals before that in lots of. Didn't have it at all or only had it very recently and so it's super hard for some people eat grains compared to other people to eat grains because they're.

Speaker 2:          02:46:17       They haven't adapted either diabetes wise or all the other kinds of things that it can cause it to go wrong. Certainly with alcohol, that's a giant fan. Exactly. And alcohol gets invented every time someone invents agriculture because all you do is you accidentally leave it there too long and it ferments. Right. And so there's an argument that we actually evolved to have a tolerance for beer rather than a taste for it because once we're in early agricultural settlements for the first time ever were crapping where we're drinking, we're not moving on. And so we found our own drinking water, so beers literally safer to drink than water, low beer and wine, low grade alcohol. And so what the data said suggest what people argue is that we evolved to actually have a taste for it, but, but tolerance to it rather than a distaste for.

Speaker 2:          02:46:58       Which makes sense evolutionarily. Getting drunk with hippos running around you can't be a good idea. Also, if you think about wine or, or any booze the first time you drink it, it's discussed. Yeah, it's hard to develop a taste for it. It's exactly right. And so, and lots of things that, that way tabasco, you know, lots of these spices have antibacterial effects so the mothers are given it to. The kids were like, on my mouth would be on fire if I want some six year old canadian India or something like that. Initially why they added sabi to sushi. That's what a lot of people argue. And in fact, as you work your way from the pole to the equator, you get more and more spices because of course in Sweden there's six pathogens and you've got salt and pepper in the jungle and then africa, you've got to get zillion spices, garlic, all of these things are super powerful.

Speaker 2:          02:47:38       Antibacterials, oh, that is a really interesting way of looking at it. Yeah, I'm sure. Right. Like Mexico, very hot and spicy food. Warm climate. Totally make sense. Yeah, exactly. And the same thing happens with the profusion of religions and languages. The closer you get to the equator, the more languages you out in the world religions, yet because people start saying, you know, on the other side of the valley, literally you could have a pathogen that makes me sick and so I'm going to stay away from you and by staying away from you. Over time we developed different languages, different religions. Again, back to Sweden, whatever you got, I got. There's three things to have, right? And so you're not a risk to me and we share the same language. We intermingle much more readily and there's more ethnocentrism is you go close to the equator.

Speaker 2:          02:48:17       Wow. To keep keeping apart makes good evolutionary sense under those circumstances, but we live in a world where no one's keeping apart. Now we live in a world where it makes it much, much more difficult and you don't necessarily least in our, in our blessitt industrialized democracies where we've got good medicines, at least for now, they still work. You don't need to anymore. Right. But we also have these crazy factory farming setups that lead to the kind of horrible super bugs that could kill a million people. We did it. I remember when I first found that out that most of the major flus, like avian flu, swine flu, I didn't know why they were calling it the swine flu. And then I found that no, it's from domesticated pigs and it's somehow more of some jumps to humans and why. And that was the cost we paid with agriculture.

Speaker 2:          02:49:04       so the first time we were starting to get. We're a cheek by jowl with a bunch animals and agriculture. I mean hunter gatherers eat them. They, the animal never lives long enough to give you the flu. Right? Wow. So everything, you know, there's always pluses and minuses when you change how you do things and we, you and I are really lucky. We live in a time where all these great medicines exist in, they haven't become worthless yet and now it's really a race against the evolution of the bacteria and devising new medicines that can continue to defeat them because everything's becoming treatment resistant. Right? That's how evolution works and and that's just starting to happen. And so now scientists have to work double time to keep inventing new drugs to stay ahead of the game with the exception of some things that just for whatever reason, bacteria don't seem to be able to evolve resistance to them.

Speaker 2:          02:49:48       Well, what's fascinating to me is not just scientists creating these vaccines and all these different medicines to deal with these diseases, but the potential of shutting off genes that potential of altering the human genome and using things like whatever the future version of crispr is going to be to. I mean they've already figured out a way to stop certain diseases. So those single gene things are great. Remember with everything being so apologetic, you don't just want to shut shit down willy nilly and so then really what you're at, the advantages, the point you made earlier. So my diet should be 60 percent protein in your should be 15 percent or mindset or more leafy vegetables in euros, whatever, and we'll be able to know that we'll know how my guts going to respond to it and how you're gonna respond to it. Well that's one of the things that 23 and me actually does.

Speaker 2:          02:50:35       They do. They do show like what foods you'd be more likely to be allergic to and what things would be most likely to be attracted and that's a great start. But what we really need is apologetic scores that tell you how do you process leafy vegetables, how do you process fats, how do you process all that stuff? And so because you knowj, genes account for most of our weight, that's most of the variance in our weather or obese or not, but nobody was obese when you and our kids have. Tons of people are obese now. So what those genes really are is genes to sensitivity to something changing in our environment. Either activity levels of the foods we're eating or how process they are or how much carbs, whatever we don't know. But that's what we're actually genetically sensitive to it because all of us have the same underlying problem.

Speaker 2:          02:51:16       That evolution didn't really worry about obesity because the problem was the opposite starving and so we were not really good at telling when we're full. ANd there's interesting evidence that suggests some really lovely studies that show that really one of the key guides of appetite was variety. When you eat a lot less variety, you're. That's when your stomach tells you you're full really much more reliably. But as you add variety to your diet, which everybody on earth can do now while everybody's got any money on earth can do now that actually you short circuit the best mechanism we had to tell us to stop eating. Yeah, that's interesting. And now as an argument that people who are experts on nutrition are, are making about one of the more recent diet plans that people are using. The carnivore diet is that just eating only meat and there's a lot of people that are doing that and they're finding that they're having all these like really rapid decreases

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       in autoimmune diseases and rapid recoveries from eczema and siberia and I'll psoriasis and the people that are. A lot of people are saying, oh, it's the meat. Meat's great for me. It's great for her and some nutrition experts saying more likely this is a calorie like you're, you're at a calorie deficit and by putting your body into a calorie deficit, you're almost like in a, in a state of fasting and you're decreasing your body weight because almost universally all these people that are that are talking about the positive benefits of these diets, these elimination diets, and just eating one thing. One of the things that they're showing us, they. They lose a shitload of weight.

Speaker 1:          02:52:46       Right? And so the thing is that I suspect you're right, that either they're cutting out what for them is the perpetrator and who would ever know out of the 4,000 things, right? Or it's literally the losing weight and then hopefully they're taking multivitamins to make it for all the stuff that they're not getting. Right. Yeah. I don't think they are.

Speaker 3:          02:53:00       A lot of them are not doing that. It's really interesting. I've been following it pretty closely and I've had quite a few people on the podcast, including really intelligent guys. Like Jordan Peterson is on this.

Speaker 1:          02:53:11       Oh, he does he and salt. Right. And for me that wouldn't work. Although I am, I, I meet in fruit basically and then very little else about grief. You leafy green vegetables. I know I should but I don't like. Um, so I know I don't like broccoli. Broccoli's edible. Oh, I know I should. So I, my, my wife makes them and I'll eat a little bit of it. But like a little kid. I know, I know, but in my way it's like these arguments I have with my eight year old. no, I know. And your year olds right now, by the way, it turns out there are genes that make people find broccoli more disgusting and more at more bitter versus less bitter. Some people really have their tongue says no, broccoli is called the beat, a little baby gene, but the one thing I would say there's this really lovely study done with that nice mix and what they did is they fed people a couple of different foods and you try a few and then you eat one until you're full and then when you come back to.

Speaker 1:          02:54:00       I don't know if you know this work, like paul rosin started with amnesiacs. If you. If I, if you're densely in music, so I talked to you. I leave the room, I come back five minutes later. You don't know who I am because you've got brain damage. When I come back with lunch, literally you'll eat a second lunch. We have such poor mechanism that tells us we're full. We think we do. We feel good. I've had a great dinner. I'm really full, but we don't realize is that's really driven a lot by the knowledge that we just ate and so what rosin found when he went back into he had eat lunch to your fault. He goes back and says it's time for lunch, and literally they all eat it again, and so what's what's amazing about these studies is then this follow up study, what they did is they served amnesic or control food people, foods that they sampled and food that they till their full.

Speaker 1:          02:54:39       So you sample potato chips and then you eat a tuna sandwich and now I come back to you and say if you're a normal, and I say, do you want to eat a potato chip? Do you want a tuna sandwich? If you're normally say, well, I just had lunch. I'm not really that keen deed either of them anymore. If you're uneasy, you say, I don't want a tuna sandwich, but yeah, I'll have some potato chips and so you don't even need to know you ate it. And so your hunger mechanism is still there, but the fact is you've had a lot of tuna sandwich and that's controlling your appetite. It's making you feel like you don't want to eat it anymore. And so in the same sense, you go to a steakhouse, you think, boy, I love this. My favorite steak. I could eat it forever and then you finish it or not, and then you think, oh, I'm stuffed and somebody goes desert.

Speaker 1:          02:55:16       Actually, yeah, that does sound good, right? Because now you're shifting and you're eating something else, and so I suspect that what guided our ancestors was the fact they had no variety. What's for dinner was not a question you ever asked. Whatever dad killed him, whatever mum dug up like there's two things there. Right, and so you're going to gorge on the meat. There's not a vegetarian hunter gather on the planet. You when you, when you're hungry everyday. Everybody loves me. It's not only whatever. You can every loves it. Every in every hunter gatherer society meet is a big deal. Someone comes home with a big kill. It's a big deal. When you can afford to be very well fed, suddenly you can start to think differently and even have different preferences, but you don't if you're a hunter gatherer and so literally if they had killed a giraffe, you're just stuffing as much.

Speaker 1:          02:55:55       Draft me down the pipe as you can and it makes sense for you to then evolve. Okay. You're going to get nothing new out of the giraffe you eat other than you're going gonna. Pull it out the back end. It's time to shut this dinner down. Right? But if you told me, oh look, we've got this other thing that's helpful. Well, there's nutrients in that I don't already have. And so you could imagine getting hungry again. That's what they did to suggest. Well, it's interesting because that's kind of the argument that these carnivore diet people use is that that is the most beneficial food because that's the food that you look forward to the most, the right, but don't forget you only need to do this within every meal. So if you sit down for your favorite lobster dinner just to have lobster and then that doesn't mean emptied it for lunch or for breakfast tomorrow. Now you can have pancakes. Whatever it is. The key is within every meal, minimize your variety because that's where the effect is having itself. It doesn't have to carry over time. It doesn't mean you lobster every single meal. You know it's interesting. That's actually the gracie diet.

Speaker 3:          02:56:46       There's jujitsu family called the grace, started the ufc and world famous brazilian jiu jitsu family, but just a family, philip killers and one of the founders, I believe it was carlos gracie invented this. He invented a diet that was basically you shouldn't mix foods together. if you're eating fruits, you should eat fruits by themselves. You meet, you eat that by itself, and that in combining all these things together, your body produces a variety of different enzymes. You don't get as much nutritional absorption.

Speaker 1:          02:57:16       Now that may be. I have no idea. I don't know. I don't understand the underlying bio science, but what I do know, the psychology suggests that you'll stop eating sooner if within any one meal you have less variety, so the psychological level we've we appear to have evolved to not want that anymore. When we've had enough of that be it a taro root or mom dug up or a giraffe are dad shot, so these sort of evolutionary traits that are

Speaker 3:          02:57:41       inside of our bodies, they would. They would sort of encourage us to eat much more if we have a variety of different foods. If you're eating at a buffet in vegas,

Speaker 1:          02:57:51       yeah, versus if you just eating chicken, that chicken, you'll eat as much chicken as really you need and then you'll stay. I don't want any more chicken, but if there's chicken mashed potatoes and corn

Speaker 2:          02:58:02       on the cob and then cole slaw and our ancestors never faced that prompts the date. We don't know how to deal with it and the other side of that coin. So what steve simpson did, this guy who did the early study on protein and locus, he, he took his biology students on field trips and he would talk to the food to increase the protein in the food or decrease it in the food, but it's the exact same foods like to read in the same roles in the same sushi, but he's increasing levels of protein in those foods and then it's a buffet and all he does is weigh the food when it starts and when it finishes across all the students eating it and he found that as the protein levels go up, the amount of food that people eat at the buffet goes down.

Speaker 2:          02:58:37       So there's these two parallel mechanisms, one were made of protein and so that seems carbs do drive appetite, but not nearly as strongly as proteins do. So you, the tolerance and how much courage to lead is huge. The tolerance, how much protein. Juliet is very narrow and he finds out of course, when he finds that in crickets and now he finds it in humans. And then I think the other side of that coin is, is variety. And the bad luck for us right now is we live in a world where, especially if you're poor, proteins are expensive and hard to get. So you're going to have these high carb diets and then everybody can have variety and variety is probably a really bad thing that is so fascinating is that are our good fortune is our demise. Exactly. And in so many ways, I mean, you know, we evolved to seek out fat, sugar and salt because they were in short supply another every.

Speaker 2:          02:59:19       Now you, if you eat them every time you see them, you're stuffed. Right? They're everywhere, man. I mean everything you eat as fat, sugar and salt. Exactly. And then the other, it's not just what you eat. We also evolved. So if there's a novel per person in the opposite sex, it comes along. Boy, what a rare event that was. Maybe fat. sugar. Exactly. You should jump on that train, right? Because that'll give you a new genetic opportunities, but you look out the door, there's novelty everywhere. it's super hard. It's hard to stay married in the city than it is in the country. It's hard to stay married if you're a celebrity than if you're a nobody. Because those people are just dev novelty constantly. They have variety constantly. And the rest of us, well you know, there may be variety out there, but they're not interested in me. So it's kind of irrelevant. Anyway. All right bill, thank you so much. I can't wait to read your book. Excellent approach for everybody. It's available right now. Go get it. You. Fox is awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you. Really fun. A lot of fun. Thank you. Bye everybody.

Speaker 5:          03:00:23       That's amazing.
