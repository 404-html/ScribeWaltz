Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Listen to me. Dirty fucks cause among going to say this, once the end of the world show, there's 68 fucking tickets left there, probably all spread out. You're probably not going to get to sit with your buddies, but you got to have to deal with that shit. Okay? That's how, that's how the world works. If you don't get your shit together early and get the tickets, you're going to have to live in the fucking boonies for the show. You're going to have to just go out there, get your freak on, sit with some other people. They will probably be wearing desk squad tee shirts. You'll be fine. Honey, honey band, Joey motherfucking Diaz, Doug, Stan hope and Wa 1221 2012 will it really be the end of the world? The fuck knows. No one's ever predicted anything, right? Ever. Do you know that? Do you know that? Okay, and if the Mayans were so clever, where the fuck are they now? Exactly. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       This podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com if you go to o n n I t.com and get yourself some Alpha brain or some shroom tech or some upgraded coffee. We just started selling Dave Asprey's bulletproof coffee. Did you know that? A lot of coffee when you buy it, this is really kind of crazy, but a lot of coffee when you're buying it, it has a fungus on it, so it's, it's not healthy for you. I did not know that until we went to j. We have the Dave Asprey podcasts and he explained it to us. Uh, his, his coffee does not have any of those issues is he believes that that's the one of the reasons why coffee has gotten a bad rap, um, from people as far as health test, he feels like more tests need to be done because the, the negative health repercussions, he believes a lot of them stem from toxic mold.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       It's on your coffee. It's crazy shit. If you go to bulletproof exec.com, he'll explain everything far better than me because he's actually smart and not just repeating shit that smart people have already figured out like me. Um, also at Onnit we sell kettle bells and battle ropes and basically all shit manly. Okay. If you look at and get your fucking your life together and live at your optimum best, we sell all sorts of supplements for that and we got a lot of crazy shit coming down the pipe. We have a lot of new stuff, uh, at on it. We're constantly trying to hone your pill ad you were working on a testosterone booster. There's apparently a bunch of different natural herbs like I'm tongue got Ali and a bunch of different ones that have actually been shown to have a real effect on, uh, on the, uh, your, your body's production of testosterone.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       It's fascinating standing instant boner pills that I don't need this. You need, well, you need that stuff that you were taking, which was basically a, some of a, a Viagara. They kind of like fudge it according to a Aubrey. Aubrey explained to us how these a boner pills work when you buy, like those are the supermarket or drugstore or whatever. Those actually do work. And one of the reasons why they work is because a lot of these companies they take and they buy, uh, I forget the exact chemical name for Viagara but whatever it is, they buy that stuff in bulk and then they throw it in their supplements. So yeah, you take it, you get a boner cause it's Fiat agree.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       Fuck. Cause I guess there's like this loophole where the FCC or not the FCC with the FD. Yeah. And WIA and Drug Administration. Yeah. They give you like a warning if they catch you and so like a little fine and you know, and then

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       if you get, if you get busted again like the third time, apparently it's big one. It'll just change the cause. That's what the boner pills are. We don't have anything fake. Okay. Everything we're selling, especially with regards to supplements, it's very important. Brian and I sort of agreed this when we first started taking on sponsors, we didn't want to take on anybody shady. We've passed on people we've had some offers for, you know, would have paid us money that we were like, I don't think we shouldn't be involved with that. We only want to be involved with people that are doing legit, honorable things. And one of the coolest things about [inaudible] is the supplements are very good that the highest quality available, but if you don't like, if you order 30 pills of Alpha brain, you try it and say, this doesn't do anything for me.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       You get, you can get 100% of your money back. You don't have to return the product. Do you say the shit sucks? That's how, first of all, how confident we are that we'll we're selling. You actually works if you're a mass and your health is not in order. You got a neat deal with that first before you think about any of the facts of supplements, especially something subtle and a, although effective like nootropics. You got to get your body together. Okay, do you eat healthy? Drink a fuck load of water. If you're taking opiates, stop. If you're smoking cigarettes, please try to stop. Drink a fuck load of water. Take yourself was that,

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       don't take the powder. If you don't, you ever find this boner pill at that? Don't take it. It's not good. No, because I thought it was good cause the guy said was awesome. But look at the bottom right. It says one capsule for three days. I had a boner for three days, so don't do that. Oh well you know what that means apparently, but the way it works is

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       there's Viagra but then there's Cialis and Cialis, Cialis. I almost will last like a couple of days. So that's probably what they put in now.

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       All right, well that's not a good idea. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       they're selling you, they're selling you some fucking drugs and they're sneaking them in. Well that's the thing about supplements. It's like, it's really, it's a funky thing because the government, although obviously they don't do the best job of regulating the dangerous chemicals and, and, and um, actual pharmaceutical drugs because there's a lot of them that wind up being like really dangerous. A lot of them that they pass at p people wind up dying from getting strokes. And I mean, we've all heard those late night lawsuits where someone who was on x drug for, you know, during the period of this year, in that year when it's snuck through and something was really bad for you. But the supplement industry is not really regulated at all. It's really kind of a wild west situation. That's why it's really difficult when it comes to something like a nootropic. It's like this is this really work cause this real there on on a.com if you go there, this is a science page that explains all of the, the, the clinical studies that have been done in the various ingredients and what's good about them and what's been shown, how they've been shown to improve people's scores.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       Uh, anecdotal evidence, I'm a huge fan of it. I'm a poker players. A lot of poker players love Alpha brain. It's just another thing that you should be doing to keep your body functioning at an optimal level. It's not the one thing that's going to fix you, but it is a, another thing that will help you. It is all the various nutrients that support the the brain's production of human neurotransmitters. And even Dennis Mckenna was impressed by our ingredients, which was very exciting. Use Account Code, name, Rogan and save yourself. Um, 10% off any and all supplements. All right. Your Fox. We have too many pot. We have too many sponsors

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       live anymore. Yeah, we have a fucking shitload. We've done. You want to say something? Yeah, I just got my ting. Fun. Yes. Sponsor. How crazy. Huh? I said that's our next sponsor because they finally get, gave me one of these Samsung Galaxy s three, which had been playing around like crazy with and it's great man. And that fucking big scream really is a big difference. Game Changer when you go online. Yeah. It's a game changer. Apple, you fucked up. You should've just admitted that you fucked up and went, went with the bigger screen. Yeah. Who's working over the apple now? Steve jobs probably would have went with a bigger screen. And you, it feels great about it because I, I'm going to be using it as my, my second phone is that you, if you don't want to like pay for it, you could just lower your, your, your minutes down to almost nothing per month.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       I think that the lowest, it was like six bucks a month for having like just nothing like, you know, so how many minutes is it? Uh, I think you pay per minute when you're down at six bucks a month. Oh Wow. So it's like when you're in a foreign country, so like you could just pretty much like Jeff fall off the face of the planet with that phone. If you want to know. I know a lot of people have down to like no phone calls right there. They're like, oh, you texted me if you called them up, they don't answer. And it's just say, don't leave me a message. Leave me a tax. I don't listen to my voicemails. I know like 10 people that, that rocket like that. What Tang is a what Brian's talking about. Unfortunately honey, honey, it's just sitting here staring at nothing. Just nothing here, but then they have bad ass phones and they're pretty much unlocked on tings network. So you could pretty much just get sweet phone. You don't have to have in any contract. You go there. And I think if you put in, what does it, ting slash Joe Rogan. It's broken.ting.com if you go to Rogan dot. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       ting.com you first of all, you save 50 bucks off of uh, any of these. A really sweet android phones. They have the uh, the note as well, which is that Samsung fucking giant tablet phone most. It's so ridiculous. It's so awesome though. I that Ma, I must possess it. It's like, can I have to add in your pocket? When I look at it, I get envy because people at shows that come and they take pictures with me after the shows and they all, so many of them have that note in that always go, Ooh, I wish I had your phone, your phone. I've got phone envy. The galaxy s three is the phone MV. I'm fine with that. That one's fine. It doesn't really need to be any bigger, but the iPhone, it leaves me lacking. I'm sad. Dad,

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       do you remember we've had phone in envy for so long mean you like you would have like the, the east seven 15 we're like, oh my God, they just the e eight 15

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       like the Motorola flip phone, stupid phones. But I took a great fucking picture with that phone when the greatest pictures that ever took him by the hooker, the hooker when we're working in downtown La. And uh, it was not the downtown La of today, which is a, what's that word? What's that word when they move into a neighborhood gentrify black cloud, black cloud or wipe out. This woman was walking by and she was heating a meatball sub and she had a wig on and she was an overweight African-american Hooker. And I looked at her and, and she goes, how you doing? I go, what's up baby? And she pulls a tid out as I'm taking a picture of her with a meatball sub in one hand and a tit and the other. And it's perfectly framed. Like if I was a conspiracy theorist, I would say, well, this was fake.

Speaker 4:          00:09:43       This is obviously Photoshop. This never really took place. Do you think it's perfectly frank? I think it's online, right? You find it, pull it, pull it up. Oh, it's a woman's breast. It's not even pornographic, disturbing looking like it. You can see a male's breasts. Why can't you see a woman's breasts? You know what's fascinating? You can see Chazz Palminteri is brass. Did you know that? Yes. Not Chazz. Palminteri Chaz Bono. I get them confused. The Bronxdale. I bet you could find it. I bet you could see his as well. He's married. No disrespect to Mr Palminteri. It was a slip and met Chaz Bono who used to be used to be chastity Bono and then it's a famous daughter of share and got a sex change while there was like these photos of her walking down the beach topless because now she's a man. Now she's got like a beard, so she's allowed to walk topless.

Speaker 4:          00:10:36       So she's taking advantage of that and she's walking topless and she's, that's her. That's her. That's the girl. That's the lady that is a real picture. Pull that shit up all the way Ustream was with us. Don't worry. Brattle will be fine with it. Dot. Don't do it, Brian. I'll do that. Just show them. Show them the meatball sub. Just the meatball sub in a hand. Come on photos. Perfectly framed. Listen, do you can you can Photoshop one, make a copy of that. Make a copy of that and just put a little blurry on the nipple that only take you a second ago. Can you do that Brian?

Speaker 4:          00:11:14       The folks that are listening to this are not getting the full experience, but you could find, what is the v how'd you, if you just type a black hooker Rogan, there you go. That's my girl. Greatest picture I ever took and I took it. One of those stupid flip phones. So the phones at tin has are a farce period there. They're the best, the best android phones that you could buy. Imagine the aerial is on those phones. They must be crazy. It'd be so crystal clear. Then people would really say that. I faked it. Um, it, it's an awesome company. They don't have contracts. They have really reasonable rates. And if, uh, if you don't use all the minutes in your plan, they refund you the money on your, the next bill. That's tit. They knock your next bill down. It's like, it's

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       like the best company. It's like they're ethical. They're not evil. It's possible to run a business and not be evil. It's possible to provide an excellent service, which by the way is off the sprint backbone there on the sprint backbone. So you're getting sprint coverage. You're getting, it's not like, you know, fucking Fred cell phone service. It's like legit. It's a huge nationwide network that's really excellent. And it's CDMA, which I prefer to GSM. GSMS at T. And. T. I have both, but I'm a t and t works better overseas. Most people accepted overseas, but CDMA, I find like Verizon and sprint, I find that it's just seems to be a better coverage. That's just where we live. rogan.ting.com go there. Save yourself 50 bucks. You dirty fucks. You got that video game. It's pretty bad ass that I've been playing. Yes. Kerosene games. This is our last sponsor.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Um, blade slinger is this game that kerosene games. Uh, we, you know, we want to make sure, again as we said, that anything we get involved with is something that, you know, we would actually use something that we would actually enjoy and something that is coming from, you know, a really a good place. There's a lot of video games that they make for the iPad that really, they're not really iPad games. They're like PC games that they it over to it and they kind of suck. A lot of them suck the way that uh, this this company, kerosene games, it makes plates slingers done it. They've made this game from the ground up for IPAD and iPhone. So it's very intuitive touch controls and with the, the ability that they have these processors for these iPads now and, and phones, it's like that was always like an issue with computer games back in the day was like, could your video card handle it?

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       You know, like really like stunning graphics. You remember like playing quake and those games when video cards were first coming out and people would have like dual sli where they would have to video cards just to, just to power the graphics. Well these fucking iPads are so powerful now. I mean you could see really amazing graphics on an IFAD. It's, it's really nuts. We live in strange times. You just say it. [inaudible] I didn't say that. I just repeated you iPad goddammit. Slip of the tongue. Uh, the game is called blade slimmer. This is their first game. It will be out for the android operating system in January or February and it will probably only work on like the more advanced android phones. Like the newer cause android, you know, they have like ice cream, what does an ice cream Sundae or something like that have a bunch of like weird names and their operating systems, they constantly, so as long as you have like the, the latest shit it'll probably work for, it's a good one. Uh, but again, the game is blade slinger. It's a fucking bad ass game. It's only $2 and 99 cents, which I, you know, I think it's on Sarah, right? Oh, that's right. That's right. It's on sale for 99 cents.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       I think the end of the year you should totally buy it. Now it's nine, 9 cents. What the fuck is, you know, if you can't, if you can get a homeless person, a dollar, you can buy

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       game, uh, that, that will, yeah, that's ridiculous. That's amazing. I didn't know that. Yeah, I didn't even think about it that way. You know, like a homeless guy on a

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       dollar. Yeah. Like this is something that you will enjoy. That homeless guys is going to be like woo. Dolor yes, exactly. And this guy, um, this game, uh, what the fuck are you talking about? If you go to, if you go to kerosene games.com, forward slash blade slinger, right. There's a, a really a, a cool a preview. You could actually, we could actually show it here and it'll look good as opposed to at my stupid studio, which has shit Internet bandwidth, have a new studio, but the Internet sucks a fat one. So we're here. That's what we're here. Oh dear. A points unknown. You can't tell the people on the Internet where the fuck your studio is. Is the phone number, man. I just want to call and talk to you anyway. Go there. Go check it out. Go Fuck Yourself. Okay honey, honey is here. Goddammit. Video that blade. Sing. Sure. Put it on. Oh wait, nevermind. There's an advertisement, an advertisement first. Come on. Period. Second advertisement or whoever, or kerosene games. Listen to me. Take that fucking ad. You're selling of video game and you're going to have an ad, the front of it. They're fucking you man. All right, so the ruin and your click through rates. Okay. All right. This doesn't have one. Here we go. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       so this is uh, the game graphics actually, which looks like to me almost like an x box and a ps three

Speaker 4:          00:16:19       is a deserted. He sends his days of war. May Not, that's not the real narrator. The narrator, this is a four year old kid. One of the things we want to call attention to here and integrate. So there's, this is, this is just like a, a like one of those where it's a preview of the game, but it's a trailer

Speaker 2:          00:16:37       or anything. Yeah, it's a, but it's cool. You use your, your iPad to like swipe and you know, do certain signs when you're, you're attacking and stuff like that. But uh, the graphics are amazing. It's a fun game. And uh, I think they're going to be adding onto it cause it's, it, you know, it's a, it's a game that I see has like a good future where they can just add new maps and stuff like that cause they already have the, uh, the groundwork down. So yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       Powerful Blade Center. Yeah, go check it out. Like I said, it's a, it's a dollar now that's a, that's the latest. So, uh, they're very happy with it. It's for until December 29th or so, and then returned return to its normal price. So, uh, right now get it for a buck. You are not paying attention. We're selling people selling souls, souls, $1 some seriously high technology. Honey, honey, is he Brian? Cue The music. Let's get the party started. That was probably a long ass series of brochures. The Joe Rogan experience, Joe Rogan podcast, my night, our commercials on long, they're wordy, but we get them out of the way

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       and then once they're done, they're done but shorter than Thomson. Her and Christina has it. [inaudible] podcasts. They have long commercials than us. Yeah. Every time I, I count to where they actually start the show, it's like 26 minutes in. They do at the same style where they just start talking and then they sort of fuck around and go off on tangents and they go back to tour dates and stuff. No. Well, it's weird. That's how we started it. Yeah. It's a good way to do it though, I think. You know, they keep trying to pressure me to put commercials inside of podcasts and I keep telling him to go fuck themselves and casually. No, they bring it up, you know, they say we would like you to start introducing commercials in the middle of the podcast and they can be prerecorded and we'll stick them in afterwards.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       But that seems, that seems sleazy. That seems like it interrupts the flow of the conversation, right? Yeah. You guys hammered yet? I feel warmth and I feel warm and toasty. Yeah, we're drinking maker's mark. Shout outs. Shout out to my boy. Justin loves this shit. Hey Justin, my friend Justin, we were telling him to go out yard. Yarders a shit. Bikers. Magrigen coke. Why put the coconut though? Why don't I just go right with the maker? Because he's seven feet tall. He does whatever the fuck he wants to trust me. Justin wants to put coke in his makers. You just let him. Wow. He's a biggest human. I know. I like zero slow mover. Uh, well. I mean you might be able to outrun them. It might be, but God damn, when he caught you, you'd be in fucking lots of trouble. He said, I have a friend who was a true giant, really sweetheart of a guy. This is the dude. Yeah, it was a true giant is enormous and talks like a normal guy. But he's like, he's just a huge fucking guy, you know? That's funny how people are like, just not created equal. You know, there's dudes like that. There's a whole art, our tour manager is six, seven and he talks about that a lot. He's like, it's really difficult. You know, you go to like when we're on tour at the holiday and he's like in the shower only comes up to my chest between my nipples.

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       He's big and tall, you know what I mean? Is he can never find pants that fit him. He liked to, to represent pants. I was watching TV today, uh, and there was a fight from 19 or 2009. This guy semi shelt send me, Shell used to be the k one Grand Prix champion. I think he's won at least three if not four times. He's six foot 11 six foot 11 300 pounds. And it's just like good luck cause go fight that guy. He's a fucking legit giant. I mean he really is a giant, small and mighty though. Like what about that guy was like, not once the big guys learn how to fight. The big guys learn how to fight too. The idea is that the small man with skill can overcome the big man who has no skill. I, I still maintain that most most of the time. That's accurate, but a big man was skill is a fucking pain in the ass like this stupid ones. You would like to think that everybody would like to think the good looking guy. Good looking women. A lot

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       of people would like to think they're stupid. Nobody wants to think there's a girl who is way harder than you and also a way smarter than you. That's too, that's depressing. Yeah. It's suppressing his fuck. That bitch just got all aces. You know? She was born with a bunch of aces. Boobs. Yeah. It's not fair. It's not. It's totally not fair, but that's life and they have to deal with everybody trying to drag them down. I'm must. Yeah, I would guess, I would guess it would be really hard to be a hot check to deal with a lot of country women. I've seen women get country with pretty girls for no reason. Like someone will come up and like ask for directions or something like that. I've seen like Condi women just immediately going, do you know where you're going? Like where I, you know, how, how much do you know this area?

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       You know, like immediately like dismissive. Yeah. I like that girl stealing something from her by existing, but being in front of her, she's not a sister. She's not a, you know, a fellow human to be, that's like someone who's taking away from your value by their very existence. You know? I knew a girl who got furious at a guy because he brought a really hot girl to her wedding and everybody was paying attention to the girl. What? So yeah, she literally said, you know, she was like yelling at him. Why the fuck did you bring that bitch to my wedding? And me and the girl was like a sweetheart. She's very nice girl. Didn't do anything to anybody, but just because she was there, she dressed nice and she was apparently, she was very beautiful and the bride was furious. Like it took away from her big day and she kept saying that that fucking bitch, she took away from my big day and then amazing God, the whole wedding thing fucking freaks me out.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       That's that pressure of it needing to be this huge monumental thing. She's a crazy bitch. Like I, she got a divorce immediately in me. I do not pass go. I don't have no idea. He told me the whole story, but my buddy told me the whole story. I was not there, but it was a fascinating story. It's like animals. You know, I was talking about, uh, I've had females, female dogs, female dogs do not like other female dogs. They just don't like each other. A dog world is fascinating. They will fight if death, if we were able to, um, communicate with each other like dogs where we would just be peeing on each other all day, Huh? Yeah. And humping in public on the regular figure out who the Alpha is. He gets to breathe. It's amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:23:10       Ben, Ben's Dog van has a dog named Larry Bird. Oh, that's awesome. That Larry Brits. I got pictures. He's great. He's fucking awesome. Awesome. Very. You know he, he's really, he's really Zinn. The dog is. He is, yeah. He doesn't really bark at all. He just like, he wants to be scratched on the head are very good friends. A friend of a friend found him on the freeway in Nashville and we moved to town. Ben's been saying he wanted a dog and a, my buddy posted an ad on Facebook and said, hey, we have this dog. We're looking for a good home. And he's got very long legs and kind of an awkward face. So the name Larry Byrd came to mind,

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       kind of Darcy is, he's an Australian shepherd. It looks bit size. Probably 45 pounds. Yeah. But I don't know if he's zen or if he's just real stressed out all the time. It's shutting down. Like I can't get very stressed when Ben leaves. Yeah, I bet. Well the, you know, it's like all the sudden he's got something good, you know, and he's got someone who cares for him and loves him. I had a female like that. I had a female than I uh, adopted and she was eating out of garbage is when I got her. She was all covered in mange. Yeah. I took her in and start feeding or taking care of her, but she would have a massive anxiety when I would leave. She would know what to do. She would freak out because she didn't think I was coming back. You know when you, you know, you get down to that point like she was like starving to death and I found her like literally in downtown La. She was just eating out of garbage cans, big dogs.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       They have access to so much Joe. It was, things were so happy. Sometimes you get lucky just as bummed out too. Well, it's such humans too. It's like if you get lucky, you could get, you could grow up in a really awesome household where your mom and dad love you and they want to see you all the time. And, and you know, you're growing up with people that have sort of a sense of perspective and they can educate you on the ways of the world and constantly give you love. Or You could grow up with a crazy fucking shithead mom and a nutty fucking violent, abusive drug addict, Dad, and you're fucked. You just fucked. You were born into the wrong spot and he's nothing he did. And your entire potential completely changes because of that. Your entire way of absorbing the world, of even just dealing with reality is compromised by this situation that you were born into with no, no effort of your own, no Karma behind it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       No nothing. You just were there unless you believe in reincarnation, you know, unless you believe in, you know, it wasn't just no fucking evidence to support any of that. But the idea that people were responsible, especially like babies are responsible for terrible things that happened to them because of things that they did in the past life. I'd have to say, Jesus fucking Christ help counties, the universe, will you let a baby slide, you know, no, punish it from some shit that some other entity had done in the past life. It's so ridiculous. It's just, um, it's, it's super sad aspect of this world. So your life could be awesome or it could be shit and it's just depending on who gives birth to you and where are you are, you know, I mean, we're lucky as file. We, I'm crying lucky as fuck you and I, all of us here and to live in America to live in 2012 in America with fucking medicine and doctors and the Internet and all this shit.

Speaker 5:          00:26:20       Well, it's interesting how the are challenges change as you're right. Like, yeah. It's kind of a, it's weird. I was, I, you know, one of my best friends in Ohio, uh, he, he got really mad about a cell phone bill. He found out that since like, I don't know, 2007 or something, he paid t-mobile $5,000, which is I think normal. If you were to add that up. And he was like, this is ridiculous. He's, I want to spend my money on other things. So he stopped using a cell phone for three months. He didn't have a cell phone. He used a land line or would communicate through email on he, he was telling me how difficult it was. But how like incredibly liberating, you know, and not that that's a problem. I'm kind of segwaying into just like you're talking about how we've evolved and like technology makes everything so easy.

Speaker 5:          00:27:04       Everything is like you could, you could take care of things at your house right now with your cell phone because you have robots there. Yeah. Yeah. But it's so interesting. You know, I've always been fascinated with people who could, um, who were incredibly resourceful with nature, like boy scouts and stuff like that. Yeah. And like how like just to go home and make a fire right now, like a little bit of, I, yeah, I sticks together, whittled myself a coffee table and I find that to be incredibly fascinating. It really actually had some spare time. Would like to learn a few tips if anybody has any, do you want to be like a subsistence? Well, I want to know how to, I want to know how to make my own boat and arrows really. Have you ever

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       watch any of those shows? Like a Alaska shows where they like, these people are like, uh, homesteaders out there and they, they gather all their food within the summer months and then they, they're fucking freezer dicks off for like eight months out of the year. Amazing. Yeah. If you're into that, if you're like, you're talking about like, I like people like living off the land and like trying to survive out there is a fucking fascinating, crazy. And this is generations after generations. These people just live like that. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:28:09       There's this level of awareness and oneness with nature that I think is so cool. Like when you can, you know something, you know, you're just like, you're, you're in the earth and so, you know, obviously I don't really have too much experience with that. I know I'm really good at fishing. I like to fish. Good. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm good at it. I know how to catch them. You like the shit you're like ready for like bass pro masters tournaments and shit. Not really red pass master. Do I do

Speaker 1:          00:28:37       fish that fishermen make a fuck load of mine. Did you know that? Like professional fishermen? Yeah. You can make a great living if you're like a famous fishermen. Yeah. How hilarious is that? This famous fisherman I think. I think we should try. You want to try something? You start entering the tournaments. I mean you're in Nashville. It's like some great bass fishing down in that area to this. I think the world record from the south.

Speaker 5:          00:28:59       That's the same thing though. That whole oneness like that just becomes part of their, you know, their receptive faculties is they know the, the fucking water. They know about the fish. Yeah. What's going on? They know they don't like that kind of tackle that lore. It doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:29:13       Yeah. It certainly becomes, you know, you have this connection with this animal that you're going after trying to figure out how to keep pulling them out of their world, but tricking them with, with fake fish. You know what a for ruthless fucking game fishing is. You throw out this impossibly beautiful wiggling, sparkly thing that makes a poor fish, just want to go bite it. And he, he bites it and it gets literally pulled out of the dimension. He exists in another dimension

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       that he can't survive in. He can't move, he can't fly around in it like you can in the water. Like all of a sudden he's in air and like what the fuck is going on? And if we pulled them right and if it's deep enough water, they'll die just from the pressure just from going through the deep, deep, deep water to the surface there. Boy, like they can't even handle it. Like, what are we doing out here? We're supposed to be at like 700 feet of water and just yank those fuckers up to the surface and they're just like, ah, you're really, you're really ruining it for me now. Sorry, there goes my fishing boner. No, listen, fishing is awesome. I love fishing, but it's gotta be a fucking, a real freak out for that. Poor Barracuda, I no bites down on your lure. And then all of a sudden they're not the rich or they're like, oh yeah, they're definitely a top shell fish. I think they're, I don't think they're tropical. That'll be think people eat them that much to their favorite song. Yeah. Did you ever, uh, like, did you like cars when you were a kid? Like that band heart to sing that song? Barracuda, they had a bunch of great songs.

Speaker 3:          00:30:45       I like heart and yes. What do you have for me? Brian redband are fixing shit. No disrespect to the vag pills and what have you. But what happened to the old fashioned boners? I mean, just good old fashioned. Well, SSRI has killed a lot of them. A lot of people on antidepressants have a huge problem getting wood. Oh, I'm normal. Boners but it's nice to have like that five hour boner boner while you're like, all right, I'll take care of you. You're just trying to challenge yourself. Really. Yeah. I want to see how much bone or I can have Olympic Boehner style. That's marathon Boehner sex. But here's my question. Um, your, your partner, I mean, I mean, are they having sex for eight hours because that sounds kind of painful. Well, he mostly sleeves. He mostly slaves, flux conscious, well played. That's Brian's thing.

Speaker 3:          00:31:41       Just gives them Ghp he takes by Agora called Bro rape. Bro. You gotta be careful about that. You can't even use it's real. Or if you joke about rape, you support rape. Did you know that? Stop? Oh, careful. Careful. No. One of the things I've been noticed, I posted this on Twitter about a lot of lefties. This is a funny thing lately where I'm like hardcore lefties, you know, [inaudible] like to call themselves progressives. They will criticize stereotypical Muslims and television and film. Like I saw these, uh, these progressive's that we're criticizing homeland. Yeah. That all of the Muslim characters are cartoonish, you know, and it's like, and it's, I find it offensive. They were like finding it offensive, but it's hilarious that they would never do that with cartoonish Christians. Like if there was like a, you know, a TV show and all the Christians had, God hates fags posters and we're walking around that you would never hear progressive's bitching about

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       fundamentalist Christians that are represented in a cartoonish way. But fundamentalist Muslims, it's like, oh, we have to be aware and conscious and we have to be like really sensitive to like these foreign people in their ideas like wackadoos that are brown. Like you have to be like really kind to them and show them kind of, but wackadoos that are white and look too much like your relatives. Like fuck them. Fuck, fuck the Christians. Fuck them. And little let them be as cartoonish as possible. But you have to be super sensitive about the way people who, you know, Islam. It is, it's not all terrorists are not Islam as if one ideology makes any more sense than another ideology as any of these fucking goofy calls make any sense, any of them. But progressive's if they don't want to criticize Islam lately, it's like these cartoonish Muslim characters.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       Okay. That's kind of how I feel about culture isn't that does as much of cold as any of the other ones being progressive as called for sure. The, the, the hardcore lefty stance is a cult. I mean, there's shit that fits in and it doesn't fit in. It's like when, when it comes to gun control and these horrible fucking mass shootings have been going on lately, you know, everybody's answer is always gun control from the left and everybody from the right is they need to arm people to make sure that this can't happen because you're not going into an unarmed area. And that if people had guns of their own, they would know, you know, they, they couldn't just do this. I mean, you know, it's a complex issue, so it's, but anyone from the left never recognizes that. It's always, it's always gun control. You fucking, and the right people, are you happy? You know, we can fucking believe this shit. Why do you need a gun? Why do you find a new hobby? You don't need to hide.

Speaker 5:          00:34:26       Well, it's really interesting to discuss this topic, um, because we just moved to Nashville and that's a gun town. There's guns everywhere. And, um, I have friends that carry concealed weapons. Um, this, there's this one girl, she's super hot chick and she's always got a little pistol in her purse, like no big deal. But I think that something that's, um, you know, maybe I'll tell you about it at a later date. Um, I think that, uh, you know, it's, it's a really interesting feeling to be in, in a town, in, in a community with that. And where I see it is that like, we, we've heard all these stories, stories of like, um, don't worry mom, dad, I'm safe. But, um, you know, like our friend, like friends of friends getting shot, um, people, people being, you know, shot several links, all these different stories and you know, there's a lot of crime everywhere. But you know, they had, they had this, uh, turn your gun in day to like try and reduce the, the firearm pop population. But like at the end of the day, like I don't, I'm not pro gun or anti gun, I don't even know what I am, but I'm just like, I was thinking about it and I'm like, the bad guys aren't going to turn their guns in. You know, and you know, it's a noble, it's a noble cause to try and

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       alleviate violence of any kind. But at the same time it's like they're already there and I just don't see how they could go away, but I don't, I'm not making that fuck. That's like a strong statement and you're making a logical statement because the real issue is not whether or not we change the laws, it's whether or not people won't break those laws. And the majority of crimes, violent crimes with guns, I believe in this country are committed with illegal guns. So it's already this weird situation. The kid who was, who was in possession of these guns, these were his mother's guns. I mean, you talk about gun control, he was, he violated a bunch of different laws before you ever left the house by just handling these guns and loading them. And taking them out of it and weren't his to fuck with. So he was violating laws and then the, then the law.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       Then the question is why do these things even exist? Why does someone need an assault rifle? Those are legitimate questions. Those are questions that we really should consider. There's no doubt about it, but the idea that we need to take all guns away, like it's like, that doesn't make any sense. Like if people want it to look, a Timothy Mcveigh did with a truck and some fertilizer, people want to, they can kill people in in a bunch of different ways with a bunch of different shit that you can get in his plans for it on the Internet. It's amazing. We really stop and think about it. How many people there are that? There's 300 million of us at least plus Mexicans in this country and we only have this many crazy, people weren't running around shooting people. It's, it's really kind of shocking. It's amazingly good considering the, the numbers.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       It's just when something does happen, it's so horrible and so heart wrenching and you, you know it, it, it fucks with our heads though. The real statistics though, if you think about how many people actually have guns and how many people are running around shooting people, it's amazing. It's amazing how behaved everybody is. Most part, if you just look at the actual numbers of human beings is there's, this is a crazy time to be alive. There's 300 million people in this continent driving around in cars getting stuck in traffic and the amount of people that actually shoot people's relatively small, but when you compare it to other countries with stricter gun control laws, you see those numbers drop. That's a hard, but the issue is they've already had that. They, you know, it's like the, you know, the, the, the question of how do you take the guns, I mean you'd have to go door to door.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       You don't have to storm houses. You know, it's like how would you eradicate the guns from our neighborhood? The way they have an England, the England, they never really habit. So when you see like low UK gun violence rates, it's like, yeah, they never really had the guns. Even the cops don't have them, you know, those, they do. They have them in case of extreme situations like American Werewolf in London, Wolf gets out if that's when they busted, you can't fuck with a werewolf and you got a Billy club, silly bitch, silver bullet. Anyway, there's, I think there's arguments on both sides. There's definitely arguments on both sides. But you know what the other argument is? The unsung discussion is what was his kid on? What was going on with his head? Was He medicated? Was he on? Who knows what from the time he was a child? Do you know how many fucking kids get put on Ritalin? Do you have any fucking kids get put on antidepressants like an un, a young age. We live in stir range times of just manipulating with human neuro chemistry. And especially when you're, you're mixing things which people do. And we will take illegal drugs with legal drugs and it's a psychotic combination, you know? Uh, the Zoloft and cocaine. It's like, it's famous for people going fucking Berserk on it. Try that.

Speaker 5:          00:39:18       Just kidding.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       It's a, well, it's interesting to know what was, what was wrong with this kid, you know, whether he had a mental illness, whether he was, uh, uh, whether he was medicated, what was, there was obviously something fucking really wrong with him just to be able to do that. Just to be able to do physically what he did and shoot kids. There's gotta be something right.

Speaker 5:          00:39:39       Way Wrong. I was worried, I was thinking about this the other day about like all these mass shootings and all the people responsible for them. And you know, I wonder if there were to be an, I mean, maybe they're already doing this and I'm foolish, I don't know. But if you were to dissect their brains and literally if there was like some sort of similar common thread of an excess of chemical or something or like Hitler, what about him finding out the bad, you know like saying that there was a human race, like there's a right way to have a brain and you know what I mean? Like, like you have to be blonde, blue eyes, you know, and anyone else, you know. So you're saying fine.

Speaker 6:          00:40:15       Common Trait [inaudible] he's saying and I was like I can't drop them in the lab running. He's really funny. I common trait of somebody that's fucked up in their head and put it on my side.

Speaker 5:          00:40:26       Pro Vigil. So give me some, what did he die? You need to get some sense of self, a good doctor to difficult thing to talk about because it's, it's horrific. It's her, right. Cause it's still everybody's, you know, it's so painful and I think that the end of the day there isn't anything that we're going to find out or be able to fix it. Whether it's gun control or anything other than trying to, trying to be as a community, more aware of each other. You know, we're talking about all these things about like at your fingertips and like we're, you know, we've, we've got cell phones that do everything for us and nobody, like, I think people stop paying attention to things like, just the, the most rudimentary level of, of human existence and, and communication of just like really seeing someone and being in touch with them. And I think some people get isolated and more and more isolated and, and I don't, I don't fucking know, you know, I just, I'll only speak for myself, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       there's a lot of us and the problem is we can't be looking out for everybody around us when we're not even in contact with them. We live in these, these communities where, you know, there's people, there's a guy who lives right down the street from you is to whore houses down. He wouldn't be able to pick them out in a lineup. And then, yeah, that's me. I don't fucking know all my neighbors. And you know, I live in a community of people that are basically strangers, you know, and they're strangers to their community. And that's not how it used to be. There's something that happened to us when we invented automobiles and mass transit. And the ability to move along great distances is we don't live in work clothes. We, we, we don't have the same sort of community that people did before they had cars.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       And that's sort of how human beings were invented or rather, uh, how human beings develop. They did, we developed to grow up in these communities, tribes where we all stick together. We all hunted together, we, we farm together, we gathered again, we raise each other's children and then someone figured out cars and it just stopped. I just started like, let's live in the fucking east side and let's drive up cross town. I want to live in a suburb. So I'd love to have a house in the mountains. And then everybody was able to just go wherever the fuck they want it to. And then they would meet for work or go over each other's houses. But the sense of community got further and further apart. Like I've had this conversations with some of my friends were like, why don't we all like live in the same neighborhood, man?

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       You know, why don't we do that? Wouldn't that be awesome if you lived across the street from me? I can't. We make that happen. Like let's like live it fun to play basketball with you all the time. But that would be fine. I'd be, I mean like wouldn't it be amazing if you could like literally live in a community of all of your friends? I don't know anybody who does that except like there's these guys, uh, this mixed martial arts guys in Sacramento, uh, Uriah Faber and all of his friends, they got a situation where they bought a bunch of houses in the same call, the sac, I think. And they just all live next to each other, which is awesome. That's the way to do it. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:43:12       I agree. I think that'd be really cool. But it's funny to talk about like tribal existence where we're, many of us have come from your, I think we're, we've all come from, you know, the, the tribal existence was everybody worked together as you know, woven into the same cloth and, but everybody had like a, uh, a job to do and an end to hold up. And we're in a society where everyone's just an individual, you know, for the most part. And it's really interesting to think about if we were going to, you know, to try to, um, have like a communal type thing. Again, I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       Well, we wouldn't have to, if we lost our ability to travel distances, that would, would really fuck a lot of people up if something happened and society was thrown into chaos and we lost our ability to get oil and gas. And that's not, that's not that far outside the realm of possibility. You know, if we look at the face of the earth, like when scientists start like going into the past and see some of the cataclysmic events that have happened, like, you know, the predate human beings. There's been some, uh, some big ones, like a lot of them, like a whole shit load of them and it's really possible that one could happen and if it did happen, we would lose all electricity essentially forever for the rest of your life. It'd be no more electricity because no one's going to be able to figure out how to fucking fix it without any real infrastructure available anymore. And you'd have a few people that were by living off the land, you'd have a few people, I mean that we could go back to that again, like that one supervolcano one asteroid, there was an asteroid that just flew by and the Chinese got these photographs of it. I retweeted it.

Speaker 3:          00:44:45       Oh it's, it flies by every four years and it's over a mile wide. Some mile wide piece of rock that flies really close to us every year or every four years. It's a mile and a half wide. Sorry, a mile and a half wide. What the fuck? What's going to happen is times pick Friday when the end of the world comes and we've got some stragglers, which will clearly be the majority of the well turn. You know, I feel like this is a real hotspot for um, you know, survivors. That's right. So we're going to have to come up with a game plan of um, you know, I'll bring the canned goods and make sure the ratio was good though. I feel like there's going to be a lot of dudes, it's going to be a lot of sausage. Should have bring a lot of booze factory. How many breathable females. Yeah, that's the problem. Some board games we have to be real careful. It was to really make sure we protect our genetics, their whole fate of the human. Russell. So now you're talking like Hitler though. A lot of good points.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       This is crazy. If you had like me, look, if you had some real engineering of the human race, you would have to do some culling. Right? It's like when you, you have a thorn or a Rose Bush and you have some fucking wacky branches, you've got to trim them bitches. We accept that. We accept that scientifically. We accept that in the nature world, the world of animals and plants, but we don't accept it with people. We connect emotions to the most horrific and fucked up amongst us and we don't even want to kill them. You know? We don't have one kill bad people. We don't want to prune them. We don't want to send them to the electric chair is barbaric. You know it's lethal injections. Horrific. We're no better than them.

Speaker 3:          00:46:32       What are you doing son? I don't know why that is. What are you doing playing, watching cowboy porn? No, I was looking for that asteroid and then an ad came up on this website. You just tweeted at us about the last thing you ever want to do. Expert Lindsey as the brain of the killer. I don't know. She talk about this right now.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       Yeah, I saw that. That was a documentary. Yeah. It was a guy who found out that he passed all the tests for being a sociopath or psychopath, whichever one that is.

Speaker 7:          00:47:00       I was going to bring this up earlier too. There's this article, it says, I am Adam Lanza as mother and it's about this woman, or excuse me, this woman is talking about her own son who has a lot of similarities between him and the shooter from this, uh, from Sandy Hook. And there's all these, if my phone was kind of freezing here, but it's talking about their struggles with him and you know, the, the, the diagnosis, they're giving them all the mood altering drugs and they just don't know how to handle a kid with this type of brain. Um, and that's when it

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       comes back to, we've been talking about this a lot, just like how do you approach the mental health aspect of this? And it's such an inexact science. It's like, how do you treat these kids? We don't really know what's going on if the treatment is making them worse or better. And that's kind of the gray area that we're stuck in, it seems like. Right? Yeah. And we also don't understand why a person develops that way. What makes a person a sociopath? What makes a person a psychopath? Is it, is it nature? Is it nurture? You know, it, everyone's different. There's different, there's a gradient live. Do you mean there's like a spectrum of different, there's people that are just a little crazy. They're okay, but they're just a little crazy. And then there's people that literally don't see reality the way we all agree it looks right.

Speaker 3:          00:48:11       There's these people that you see them sitting on the side of the road and they're talking to themselves in their covered in dirt and they haven't washed in the year and they're not in back and forth and having conversations like, okay, what's that guy seeing? What's going on? I mean, he's having a fucking full blown conversation with people that aren't even there. What's going on? What's going on there? And we don't exactly know. We know how to give them some drugs and make them not do that. And you know, we know there's something wrong was his firing mechanism is fucking noodle. But we don't exactly know what that guy seeing. You know, he could tell us what he'd be, might be lying, who know? You might be seeing some shit that he doesn't even like talk about and see seeing dragons, you know, considerable amount of mushrooms.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       Then you would know what he was saying. I doubt it. I say we try it. Well, I see your point. Lastly, you want to do is get locked into a homeless dudes way of thanking you, become him. I think I take it back to imagine people pulling the brains out on, on LSD. Like that guy from pink Floyd that they, uh, they wrote that song shine on you crazy diamond there. That's apparently about a dude who lost his mind on some LSD. You could, you could fuck up. You fuck up and go deep. And Suzanne just got nervous and reach for the market. Not Nervous. I'm smart straight. I'm accessing my pleasure energy. How does that sound? The booze energy. That's the pleasure energy. I too love it. Everything's fine guys. Don't worry. It's, you know, do you find, um, there's a lot of resistance to talking about loving it, that people like, Hey, actually I found this is really funny.

Speaker 3:          00:49:47       I, we got to, well we talk about booze all the time because I, I'm, I'm not an alcoholic, but I love Bourbon. You know, I don't drink bourbon every day, but um, you know, I talk about it cause you know, I'm comfortable that way and we've had a few emails here and there, um, some, some dude with like, I saw you at your show when you were on tour and you just looked so tired and look, drugs have torn into people here. And I was like, let me just go, let me, let's just go right over this again. You saw me on tour and I look tired. That is a shocker parking lot and I, I, I'm not going to

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       throw them under the bus, you know, to be concerned. Right. But it's, you know, well, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:50:32       from his point, there's a lot of people that think that the life of a showbiz person, it's just fucking drugs and barely keeping it together and stumbling on to stay the night that, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:50:43       dude, I know, I mean at the same time, I'm fully aware of that side. Like I, it does exist. It totally, and you should, you know, I'm sure, cause it's like when you're on the road and you're just moving all the time and you're never in the same place, you're never in this like you're fucking lonely. You know, you're, there's just so much going on, like drinking, um, you know, it was a real couple repetition. Oh yeah. Cause you're going to, you're in a different club every night, but there's always, and everybody wants to party with you. But at the same time, I really, um, I don't, I don't like, I like, I love to drink, but I don't, I don't like being wasted. I don't like not being in control and I don't like losing my voice. So there's like a balance, you know, and I'm just, I feel, I feel really lucky that I have a partner who's, you know, we, we do this together. Like if one of us was slipping there, that would there be a lot to handle. But we're, we're pretty, we're going to drag each other. You're probably slipping down

Speaker 8:          00:51:43       together. I go slow erosion nicely. You can count on each other. I remember one time both keep your shit.

Speaker 5:          00:51:51       I remember one time when we were really, when we first started touring together, Ben got really drunk and I helped, he had real long hair and I know this parabolic cute. Oh that's sweet. I tied it in a ponytail. So he looked like a, like a yoga instructor and then like probably like a few days later I got, I got a little drunk and I remember like I passed out with like my boots on and I remember like,

Speaker 8:          00:52:13       well I let a whole squad or these guys from the show and just went to town on her. Yeah. That's really, that's really fun. I think you just contributed to rape culture. I was going to say, and I'm going to call you out really Joe. Really, it's cool that you guys can

Speaker 4:          00:52:36       count on each other that you know that you're both in it to, you know, to do the right shit, you know, to get it done that you know, you're both in it to make great music. You know, it's like a lot of bands have an issue. Like there's like five guys

Speaker 8:          00:52:54       come on that as the picture and that you can see it flows

Speaker 4:          00:52:58       block out the nipple because apparently it almost sunk CBS when Janet Jackson whipped one out. Who knows what it could do to Ustream, but this, uh, this lady with her, her 10 out, I did not ask her to do this. Okay. This was the universe giving me a gift. No.

Speaker 8:          00:53:15       Well, yes and no. Cielo Green the whole time. Yes and no. It did not turn me on. It did not turn me on sexually, but it did turn me on socially because I, I was going to post

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       this online and people are going to go bananas. I was very excited. I was like, I have to show people this is going to give them great joy. I think this is the part where he started to lose it. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:53:34       mine. Yeah, I remember

Speaker 4:          00:53:43       Ryan, do you think she's alive now? Cause that was like 2005 if you had a guess, do you think that woman's Love

Speaker 3:          00:53:50       Paul subs every day? I'm sure there's some Italians live forever. Do you think God mother fuckers, they live forever. That's good to know, but that was a real moment for me. It was a, it was a great, great moment for me.

Speaker 4:          00:54:06       I wish you had that on video though. That would, yeah, it would be. It would be awesome. D G Galaxy s three via. Yeah, but then she probably sue me. I wonder if she knows the pictures out there. I wonder if someone was like, girl, do you know to your pictures online your titties out. You got to meet boss.

Speaker 3:          00:54:27       That ain't even me. My wig don't look nothing like that. That is not that good. That is not me, girl. I'm telling you. That was a Veggie saying

Speaker 4:          00:54:36       did he has pictures of you. You got your titty out and uh, meet Moss. I'll be your hand and bitch. You look fat. You look like big foot earthquake, gut. Oh, that's a gut. I'm a person who doesn't give a fuck. She doesn't give a fuck. I didn't access the Dick. No, no. That's all it takes. That's a real tip, bro. Look at it at the tip tip like that on a man, a fake tits on men always look odd and the nipples were never big enough. And you know that that nipples the correct size. That's the thing about trannies. Oh, by the way, that's another. Tell us what you know people are, people are transphobic. Did you know that Brian? That's a new issue. Transphobia. I love the progressive's are going after people that are trans phobic. If you're making any jokes about trannies, really even saying trannies. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:23       What did, did they have to joke about? We need to be more sensitive. I'm fascinated. Did we already do we talk about buck angel the last time we were on here? I feel like we did. We might not have talked to them all the time. There's never enough talk about buck angel. This is that we did a, we did a show with him. Yes we did. No, you did dip. Fucking let me, I'm telling you the truth. And we were in a Toronto, Toronto, Asia, just cute. It's in Canada. Um hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:55:54       It became a country boy. He confused the shit out of people that were like, really it was Toronto, a country in Asia as well. Um, is buck angel?

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       Well we, it was a, it was called idea city, which is like Ted talks and it was a conference for, it was really incredible. And you guys played music? We did. Yeah, we were, we were playing with our friend Adam Cohen. We were his band, so we weren't playing as honey honey, which was kinda cool because I felt like we were just a bunch of hired guns. Oh, that's kind of fun. Right? Singing.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       It was fun. Only when I go back and watch the videos, I did not play well. I'm not proud of my playing, but I'm, I'm fucking working on it and I've gotten better. So for the record. But anyway, we were, the whole thing is Steve Martin's good. He's really good. Oh my God, he's so good. We got to see him in Nashville's. Yeah. But, um, anyway, buck angel, the, the conference that we were at, I was a three day conference and the theme was women and in all the facets of like, it was going through scientific evolution and you know, in society and like there was anywhere from Olympic gold medalists to doctors and psychiatrists and lawyers and an oceanographer. This incredible woman, Doctor Sylvia Earle. I love her. Um, and then they had two different tranny's transvestites, transphobia, angel trainings. I won't try and tune man.

Speaker 5:          00:57:19       Just be you. I don't know. You can't call people twinks anymore. Why not? At the guy who's the head of the Bravo for an advocate that goes ahead of Bravo. He made it stop me, Joe. He had apologized to the twink neighborhood community. Let's see, old Greg had a man Jina I support him. Anyway, so, so, so buck angel, look, you should explain to people don't know what the fuck fucking angel is. A very famous transvestite, transsexual, excuse me, who's a woman, um, but is, is almost as jacked as Joe Rogan and, uh, just a massive frame of, of, uh, of a man of a typical man, but actually is a woman, you know, porn. Right. And does porn and a is married to a woman hall law, but which makes me wonder, does that make him a lesbian? Well he does porn with girls or guys, guys, which I did the maybe girls too, but I did, I did the, I did myself and unsolid and I was like, oh I'm, I'm curious.

Speaker 5:          00:58:26       Cause I was really fascinated by buck angel talk to, so I went online and I looked up some, some bikinis a point and it was, it was really, it really kind of messed me up because I saw him in the elevator the next day cause he was, and I was just like, Oh God, like I'm so, I'm so confused. I'm just confused. But I did it feel like gay porn. What'd you feel like? It was just like, it was a total shaved badge and it was just so, it was like you, you see the top frame, which is all like look, see, he looks like a lumberjack. He's got a goatee, he's tatted up, he has huge muscles and he lives his life as a man. So I feel it's right to call him him cause he, I think that's what he prefers and he was great. Like he was fucking cool. I liked hanging out with them but like, you know, after I saw him getting pounded by dude that look just like him into his vagina, I was really, oh there's buck on the right. That is so crazy.

Speaker 9:          00:59:22       Look at him. He's fucking huge. That really does look like a fucking dude. Big Guy. That's crazy. There's Brian added that song by the way. Did you really? Did you go look for that bitch job? If you go to that actual video, you will not get that folks. Someone needs to meet

Speaker 3:          00:59:46       the mix. But yeah, that looks like a big dude it. Yep. And there's no, there's no d downstairs, but does he have like a large classrooms? At least

Speaker 10:         00:59:57       it's, but also really, really excited that he has this project going. I just want to reach out to your kids and let you know that I really had a tough time and I was a kid. People didn't understand me. People didn't get that. I felt like a dye. It was, I got teased. I got, I was in fights constantly. I was isolated. I didn't, every time I reach out to, I tried to commit suicide.

Speaker 9:          01:00:25       Oh God. Okay. Buck. You're bumming me out. I wanted to watch. It sucks some Dick's. I didn't want to watch you try. You're acting like a little bitch. No, settle the fuck down.

Speaker 3:          01:00:38       You're insensitive. This is more phobia. Kieve people. I'm going to throw up my vegan pizza now. Oh, that's fine. And that's it. Anyway, moving on. Listen to it takes every kind of people to make this world go round. I think we learned that in the 70s and a buck angel. Good on Ya. Go get that. So then there was another transvestite that was x, the same transsexual, excuse me, I'm using the wrong, the wrong word. I'm invested. It's just a pretender in my ignorance. I was just a man in a dress. I switched to really live a sheltered life. When you go and get you shit snipped. Yes. When they move into the wonderful world of people that made the commitment, you know the name of them need a store. How did, like, so there's all these hormonal treatments that they have to undergo and have to get them every week or every month?

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       I think so. How do you afford that? That's a good question. I wonder if, um, people's insurance companies pay for it. Oh boy. I bet they do. I bet. Let's find out. Okay, let's Google. I bet they do. I bet this is something that people have been trying. There's a lot of trends that are like really in a bad place and they do not have the money to be happy if they were just switch the gender. And I think that as a community, we should be doing that for branding. Name this character. I want to give my ultra progressive Dick Wad. Give it, what's the name? Like curl at whatever you want. Cammie. Jill. Shelly. Yeah. A man named Shelly.

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       What am I looking for? I'm looking, I'm looking for insurance companies exchange. Okay. In sure ain't looking at Buck's star Vagina. Alison. Guys. This be good for everybody. I don't know why I said that. What's wrong with you? Try and keep up with our our retardedness. Yeah, I think so. Well, I think I'm feeling warm. Insurance Company to pay for sex change. Bam. What Queens woman trap for 34 years in a man's body wins a battle with her insurance company that balked at paying for her sex change operation. Wow. A Queens woman. I love how they, first of all, this is like really shitty journalism. Really Shitty New York Daily News. You don't say a Queen's woman trapped in a man's body wins about it with your insurance company. No, no, no, no. You say transsexual man who became a woman wins a battle with an insurance company.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       You don't say someone trapped in a man's body. How much maybe she's not. Maybe hang out with it for a couple of weeks and weeks and go, oh no, this is just someone that's fucking crazy, you know, isn't that possible? No, you've made this like huge judgment and painted this and um, you know, a very biased way. Although she does the glue to check. There's gotta be some people out there that have had actual sex changes and then tried to go back. Jack, I'm sure. I'm sure people were bummed out. I remember this one, this guy got really bummed out because he couldn't come anymore. He realized that he was never going to call it. That was what Nina story talked about. Nina story is the famous transsexual that was also at this conference, the ever mentioned conference. And um, she had undergone how many surgeries been? It was like, yeah, like she was addicted to plastic surgery and she had gone into like 60, 60 times under the needle.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       But she, she did something that was really interesting. She chose to have her body be a canvas and she documented the whole change. So she's, she has videos and there is again, Nina stories. Oh my God, what have you done? And, and it's funny because like you look at her and she's just like this unbelievable, like she has a figure like Jessica Rabbit. She looks like Jessica Rabbit. Exactly. And it's, it's, it's interesting. It's not, it's just like, it's a fascinating visual. And she was really intense and she was talking about her like her power and her energy and she had this religion. This is the wrong person.

Speaker 8:          01:04:36       There's another Nina's story that's a singer who sings. You fucking ruined her life. Audio clips, lyrics, concert schedule photos, a style incorporating pop alternative rock, jazz and soul. Say about it being used to have a dick. Oh No, I think it's a different person.

Speaker 3:          01:05:00       Different person. Did you find it? Oh, buck angel. Oh, what is that? Oh No, don't show me buck angels in large. Cliteracy yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:05:08       Large. Yes. It's quite funky. Okay, I'm going to look up on the storage to do that, don't you? It

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       makes me uncomfortable. Why? It makes it so don't be, don't be. But, but that was what they both talked about. It was that, and I don't blame them. They said that they didn't want to go with the full sexual transformation because the propensity of losing your orgasm with very high and he wants to lose that, but how are you going to look like a chick of you still have a duck? You know? I mean, you're going to, if you want to really be a woman and pretend you're a woman, you're going to have to give something up. Are you going to have to give up Shannon loads called a man Jina shooting loads. Whenever I think of a woman, you know, if a man wants to be considered a woman, you can't have a deck. Okay? And if you want us to call you Shane, you know what's really funny, you guys?

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       I was tempted to tell my parents to listen to this, listen to the previous to that we did here, and I was like, I bet today's going to be different because I feel like everything's cool. Educational. Really. You sure it's on a story. So we are sorry. Need a story. No story. We're so sorry. Please go support Nina story on iTunes. Go buy her shit. We apologize, Nina. Arceneaux I'm sure at your does. He does look like a crazy Barbie doll type thing. Oh Jesus Christ. This silicone diaries. Okay. That's what's really amazing is the body language cause it's still, has she still moved like a dude? Oh stop.

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       She sat down like, well she said that because she said that when she would open her legs to you, that was her power energy coming at you. Wow. Power Energy. Her metaphorical whole, goodness. Goodness. Joey Diaz and I were in Vegas once we, a transsexual showed us the package with Mrs. Reagan was there as well and she got a chance to look at it too. And Joey said it best. He said it looked like a bat with its mouth open. It looked like someone had slammed and apple core in this someone's cock cause like you don't need that anymore. Let me just sweep that bulge out and then pull some ball skin over the hole and like stitch, it looked like an empty hole where a dick used to be. Oh yeah dude. And it's in the wrong spot to by the by. Have you ever noticed a time we'll fake vaginas and they're more towards the front. Then the real vagina, you know, real vagina is sort of tucked, talked a little bit further back. Vagina. Well Taste Jeffery, a lot more salty.

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       What are you doing? Criminal. But you could show that. Well that wasn't real. It just looked like it was something sexual, but it was just a dude with his hand being silly. Maybe you guys can fucking exercise the horrible feelings and thoughts in this room and his sweep them out of here with a song. He can't do that because this conversation has gone dark, dark one. Well somehow or another we started out with dogs. It was like dog world dogs, people we in on each other. I mean it's a quick, but we can't, we got the school shootings I think led us to a dark place. Then we tried to recover with some humor and actual doc. I'm exhausted. Crazy. Got a little crazy when you guys brought up the buck cherry. So buck also, you guys are, I mean you guys know Buck Cherry. I seen him don't know him personally.

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       Oh, okay. You don't have like a buck cherry story. I liked that cocaine song. I don't even, I've never even done cocaine, but that song is great. It gets you got, yeah. Oh Man. He loves the cocaine. You cocaine. The new thing is, is liquid cocaine. I know. I've seen a lot of people having this liquid cocaine where it's in like a, like a nose spray thing and you just spray it in your nose. No, wait. Yeah. That is crazy. And so it just looks like no nasal looks like you're doing. Like you just cleaning your nose out. You're just doing it. Oh my God. These people just carry them around in their purse and he was like, it's crazy. And I guess it's better also for you. It's healthy. It's like cigarettes and good for you. It's like the cigarette with a fucking Stephen Dorff commercial.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       Guys, let's take back our ability to do coke and public. Say Back our freedom. Have you seen that commercial, Stephen Dorff? Oh my God, it is possibly. It possibly broke the Douche scale. It might've broken the Douche scale. Brion pull it up please. While we're waiting for beautiful Suzanne to urinate. This is a video. Blue cigarettes, Stephen Dorff commercial blue cigarettes. It is easily the Douchey has commercial in the history of the world. He's in black and white. Okay. And he smoked it an e cigarette. Take us freedom back, man. Why was, what's his thing? How can we know Stephen Dorff? He's, he was in bleed. Okay. Was that his breakout role? Not As, I mean you did a lot of movies but, but he was in blade. I mean he was the fucking head vampire and blade from there on. It's been a downhill slide. And to the point where no disrespect and he's like, well, goodbye fear factor guy. We're just talking about reality here. Scientists don't get upset. Know building. I probably would have done that commercial to that cigarette commercial if they paid me enough. Who knows? But once you see it, he just like, whoa. You gotta be really unaware to write this, to ask someone to do it. Forget about him. Look at this. Oh wait, thesis. I'm tired of being a walk. Brian, stop with the music.

Speaker 11:         01:11:14       I'm tired of being a walk. Walking Astrid. I'm tired of feeling guilty every time I want to light up negative one. I'm tired of being a walking asterik negative too. I'm tired of feeling guilty every time I want to light up. I'm Steven door. I've been a smoker.

Speaker 3:          01:11:32       Hold on. Pause the Suzanne messages. You got to see this cause. Hurry up and sit down. The Stephen Dorff cigarette commercial. Have you seen this? No, I haven't seen. I've seen the ads. It's the Douchey is commercial. Oh, you broke your leg. It's the Douchey as commercial and the history of the human race. I don't think there's been a douchey or commercial. It's for Stephen Dorff for electric cigarettes.

Speaker 11:         01:11:52       Okay. Juan, who? This? I'm tired of being a walking ashtray negative too. I'm tired of feeling guilty every time I want to light up. I'm Steven door. I'd been a smoker for 20 years and I just found the smarter alternative blue. He says, blue lets me enjoy smoking without it affecting the people around Malibu, not tobacco smoke. That means no ash and best hall PLO. Offensive Odor. We could smoke at the basketball game. If you want to and how about not having to go outside every 10 minutes when you're in a bar with your friends. The point is you can smoke blue virtually anywhere. Oh, that's so dumb. Oh, I don't like us then. I don't want to get it. [inaudible] I like, I like when we take our freedom.

Speaker 3:          01:12:39       I like how it looks or play. He paused away, looked at what? Stop it with the music. You fuck. Okay, look it up. I'm just like looking cool. Black and white holds it out believable. It broke to Douche bag scale. It literally broke the Douche scale. It's black and white for no fucking reason. There's no reason for that. It's an artistic choice. I'm going to do this commercial, but I want it to be already know fuck. I want, I want to look like Jack Caraway and to be honest with you, I smoke electronic cigarettes because there's nothing wrong with small then I wouldn't, I don't like to tell anyone or do it in public because I'm unembarrassed. But like I, I'm satisfied because I'm not smoking regular cigarettes cause I love them, but they're bad for me. Well, I don't think electronic cigarettes, that was, that was one of the Douchey is things I've ever been.

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       I'm, and I'm, I feel like I need to take, I need to take a time out. No, listen, I support the idea of electric cigarettes. It's not what the idea of electric cigarettes, I totally support it. But that approach, the cool guy on the beach, someone should get up there and be like, hey, I do this. But it's, it's pretty clean image that they're trying to portray is like this man who's like rugged with his, like his stubble by the ocean with like a Siemens jacket on. You know? I mean, he has this fucking Jack Kerouac look to him. Like he's going to go write the great American novel and he's just so cool to be around. Goes to the local bar and they all know him by name. You know, buck angel like to smoke cigarettes on them. Meanwhile, I'd like comes up the puck angels pregnant, Stephen Dorff loved

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       child. What if fucking you'll go. I don't, I don't know. I don't know if it can work anymore. Yeah. They would come out. It would be dragons. That's where dragons come from. The societies figuring out how to turn a man to a woman than a guy fucks it and then it gets pregnant. A dragon is born. I think I saw that in game of Thrones.

Speaker 5:          01:14:32       Where is it? Chemo Thrones coming out in March. It's isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Ooh, you just made me excited about March. I can't wait. [inaudible] the end of the world can't come. It's, you know what title I honestly, I'm going to take back what I said before, but what? I think we're okay. I think we're okay. I really do. We're okay with just the aliens are coming. Well, I think the only is already here. I know. If you get in an isolation tank, they'll talk to you. Did you? There's that show. This is, I fucking love this. I haven't seen it. I don't even know. What's the show called on the neighbors or something where it's about aliens and they, they, they come to life. No, they come to earth. That's what the dude from me are. I'm not sure what all I know is Mike. My friend told me about it, and I forgive me if I miss miss quote myself, but the show is about these aliens come to earth and it looked like people and they don't have very, uh, they don't have like substantial up to date information on how to integrate themselves into the human society.

Speaker 5:          01:15:28       They have this like sports almanac from 1985, so they all give themselves names like Jackie Joyner Kersee and like Larry Bird and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and it's like a six year old white kid and his name is Kareem Abdul Jabbar. I could be totally wrong. I've, I've never seen the show, but my friend was telling me about it and I thought that was funny. That's kind of funny. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:45       Yeah. That, that's how the aliens come and six year olds at pretend to be black athletes. Dude, I would, yeah, that's how I do it. Confused the fuck out of everybody. Uh, before you guys get started, I gotta give a shout out to the float lab. The float lab in Venice, California, and the premiere isolation tank, uh, people builders in the country, they're there on the west coast. If you're ever in California, if you're in San Francisco, oh, take a flight down. Trust me. You need to see what these guys are doing there. They have like, they're taking isolation tanks to the next level. They just installed a new one in my basement this week. It's crazy. You got to come see it. We've got to make a new video and we'll that last video you, hey, let's make a new one because this new ones insane.

Speaker 4:          01:16:25       And uh, I want to, um, take care of them. If you, uh, if you're in Venice or anywhere near it and you can, you can get there. I think it's only like 40 bucks for an hour and a half or something like that. They're very reasonable and without a doubt they have the best equipment on the planet earth. This new one they put in my basement is eight feet long and six feet wide to frank. Go in there, check it. Yeah, you get get up a group. You get to have a party in that bitch. Get Buck, buck, buck angel and Buck Cherry both together. If buck angel got pregnant from Buck Cherry

Speaker 5:          01:16:59       might be the apocalypse if you had to be in the, in the isolation tank with all of them and Steven door. Yeah. Wow. Y'all crazy bitch bitch. Fuck so good. A lot of top

Speaker 8:          01:17:09       of it. Trying to be cool by the beach man. I'll think what you're doing is cool at all. It's isolated. It's together. Good for electronic cigarette. Try to be in a guilty but lighten up and you could light up at a basketball game. Cause you know me man. I like to go to the game. Oh hang out with the guys have a beer. Why does your man vaginas smelled like Jay Moore? What exactly the chain

Speaker 4:          01:17:39       smell like? Bookshare archangel by boat by the way. I'm a buck cherry fan. Don't get it. Don't get it twisted right. I love Buck Cherry. That crazy bitch song. When I think about my ex girlfriends, like all of them that they could play like all my memories of every check that I dated until I was like 26 and throw them together with a buck cherry song. That crazy bitch song. Just all the my memories of every crazy one of them. Splice them all together. So respect to Buckcherry and respect to buck angel. Fuck it man. If you really feel like you were a dude, fuck it. Get in there. So I know you've done a great job of looking exactly like a dude. You know, if you were in Jujitsu class, I wouldn't want to roll with you. You look quite big.

Speaker 5:          01:18:29       I have to deal with that kind of horsepower. Would you shrimp out? I will do. I'll hit escape. Try to hip escape. You know what we did on, on a Saturday night this past weekend inside trim, we went to an amateur wrestling night in Nashville. It was Friday night. That sounds awesome. Those things. That was our second one. We went to one of the most people in this past year, like three months ago by default. And it is a, it is an unbelievable thing. It's a social experiment, right? It really is. And it's a, for some reason around like really big dudes. I like something happens to me where like coagulating I think it is, I swear to God because I like, okay, one time I was in Las Vegas with my whole family by the way, because we all like to drink and gamble. Um, and we were at the Rio and it was Christmas time and all of a sudden all these Chippendale's came out with Santa Claus and I was like,

Speaker 8:          01:19:21       oh my God. And I got pulled onto the stage and I couldn't do anything except go cause they picked me up in there just to know big. And I just kept touching their arms and I was like, oh my God. Did you add your, your hormones start firing time.

Speaker 5:          01:19:37       I'm a real, like I'm a real, I'm a real personality kind of girl. So the whole thing. I think just the actual visual is so it's such a shock to my system of like a big dude. Right? He's like picking me up in his shirts off and he's very, he's hairless and greasy. But will you willing to let it go and like, except the fantasy. Oh yeah. It was a total fantasy. Total Magic Mike on his mother fucker. Yeah, I mean, and I dunno, in my mind he's probably hung like a field mouse and I was fine. I'm just in your mind, rationalize it. I was like, yeah, there's nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       This is, this is all wrong. It's all wrong. But there's some in your personality, the big dude, I mean the big dude thing is such a crazy phenomenon. So you could go into a parallel dimension which could never be accessed again, and those Chippendale's guys could just run a train on you, but no one would ever know. You'll be cool with that. As long as he can just let it go for like, why it's not even a real, it doesn't even exist. And after it's over you go right back to the moment we thought up that idea. You're the only one with memory. It's all good. You know if we had some deep talks and they held me afterwards I think I'd be cool with that. Tough to find deep talks and the Chippendale's guys and probably a lot of, and those guys are listening to this podcast right now.

Speaker 4:          01:20:45       Right now they're gone bro. Okay. If you were in my shoes, fucking magic. Mike fucking got me going. I was into it but anymore I digress. And he wore, we were at the, we were at the amateur wrestling night and there was one of those dudes and it was like he was not obviously he wasn't great. A top choice muscle meat for me but he was really interesting and there was three personality, I disagree, but grade a top choice of muscle meat. How do you define that? Do you have like, it's all like, but you're looking for like a Brock Lesnar type character. Like what is your grade A's? Brock Lesnar, Brock Lesnar, a former UFC heavyweight champion.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       So I need some help with like the Russian dude and rocky. Yeah. He looks like a viking. Like he looks like come here on a boat with a fucking sword in his hand. [inaudible] page. I'd probably cut your head off while he's, while he's fucking you. It'd be like an experience. This is so bad and I believe I was going to tell my parents to listen to this, to Christ. They don't. I'm sorry honey. We really apologize if you're listening right now. We didn't. We didn't mean to paint her and such an unfavorable light. This is all just play. We're applying. This is Internet Haymont and real life. I would never talk to your daughter like that. She's a beautiful human being and I respect it very much, but on the podcast, we've got to take our shots for entertainment. Okay. And that's where the whole gang bang run a train Chippendales in the parallel dimension thing came from. I don't want that to happen. I don't think Suzanne wants that to happen either.

Speaker 4:          01:22:25       But afterwards where they say, I don't think anybody knew what to do because I was just like, wow. I was like, I was high. I mean they picked me up. Right. Is that feel good though? Kinda kinda tall. That doesn't happen very often. I can manhandle you women want that shit. That's your DNA crying out. So I do. Doesn't want the opposite of God doesn't want to check her. Carries them upstairs. Like we'll tell fuck for girl picks you up and carries you upstairs to fuck you. You're like, okay. You already defeated how many guns that happen. I don't think it's ever happened to me yet, but this is Rogan. Life was young. Things can happen. People can you crazy?

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       Yeah, but a man doesn't want a woman, Karen. Right. Have you ever had to do carry, you met a girl rather carry you Ben? I'm not in a sexual sense. Maybe. Uh, just around town. Just hopped on a few backs, I think. Wow. Yeah. That's, you gotta be really confident. Someone has a fall backwards and we'll get back to that stuff. I have. Especially when you grab people, grabbing your ankles, holding you, and two more of your friends. He's a big guy to more your friends. Yeah, he's, he's locked up three people body to dot. Although the w the lady was on the small side, she was very tiny. What's the small side? A hundred pounds. She probably, she probably like a five tour. That's a lot. Something like that to add to a duty dude. He's like your seven foot, bro. Wow. There's, there's some big humans out there. It happened. Honey. Honey, what are you gonna play for us? What do you want to do? Excuse me? What do Radiohead. Okay, and here we go. Yeah. No sadness. Cover, uplift. Obviously. This is a song by Radiohead that we wrote. You Ready? Okay. We're just going to go with it yet. We'll still Betty. Yeah. Is that okay? Is that okay bro? Bro, Bro, here we go. Bitches. One more time too. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:24:41       Oh, used to be all right. What happened? The cat gets show Tom. Wow. What happened? Fifties Ah,

Speaker 13:         01:27:12       awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       Then you cook this.

Speaker 13:         01:27:42       That was fucking,

Speaker 3:          01:27:48       that was really cool. Very cool. Very different for you guys. It's weird. I love it. I love it. That's a really interesting guy. Take on that song too. Yeah. You know, we, we haven't played that as a duo, which was oh really? Well we played with my roommate, uh, this very talented musician, Ben Lewis and he played, we did it a little trio style and he played mandolin and things. So it was kind of, it really sounded bluegrass. Is it still scary if you guys make, when you think like you guys performed so much together? I would think you have almost like a sort of an ESP and it comes to doing a song together and you know how to like ebb and flow with each other. Does it like when you like a song like that we haven't done as a duo before and you were just doing it because you don't want it to suck you? No, but I mean, especially if you're going to cover a fucking radio head song, you want to, you want to like do it some justice. I think that was like a B minus. What'd you think? Oh that was great. Shut the fuck up. Don't judge yourself. Okay. There you go. Right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You sounded really good on the radio. Had they release all their shit online, right? Did they do that? They do. They do both now. They did. Well they did at least one of their albums on I'm to, yeah, I think

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       they were the first big band to say name your price. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:29:05       Really? Yeah. Oh Wow. So how do they do that? They just say like you put up a paypal account or something like that so you can give us a buck or you can give us, yeah, that makes you think if we do that we'll make millions of dollars to quite there yet. I don't know. Maybe we should try. Do you guys feel a buildup?

Speaker 7:          01:29:25       I feel like your crowds are getting larger or your Twitter followers are getting more. You're getting more attention. Do you feel it? We're kind of cruising right now because we're working on this record, so we haven't been going out much. We haven't torn that much and it's, it's, it's not a lot way. It is a low cause we're not, we're not touring. You're just, there isn't the end creating new stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, um, when you do that, how do you, do you take time off the road and you just like say, okay we have to set aside x amount of weeks. Like how do you, how do you do it when you decide you're going to, we keep trying to set deadlines. No, we're setting deadlines. Um, so we're, we're going to be recording by late February, but we still, we have a lot of work to do. You know, we have a lot of writing that we haven't done yet and we've been, it's so funny. Last time we were here we were doing the Kickstarter stuff and in between we've been making all the rewards, all the people who donated.

Speaker 3:          01:30:15       Oh, the videos. So Haikus, man. I tell you something that's hilarious. It's been, it's been really, really good

Speaker 5:          01:30:21       fun and a lot of work. But like the, the actual, it's just the two of us, like nobody's helping us with it, which is really, really the truth. And like each person, like half, like, you know, 90% of them, we don't know who they are and that it's such a cool feeling. Like, you know, someone gave us like people giving us $500 or even $25, whatever the case is, like a really amazing feeling. And then like to write them, they're Haiku and, and so like stuttering. Well it's, it's really cool. I hear what you're saying. It was fun, but we're almost done. Um, and we've got a couple of shows, you know, things like that here in there. But really we're just writing.

Speaker 3:          01:31:01       It's really cool. And you know, these people were always going to have this connection with you now,

Speaker 7:          01:31:06       you know? Yeah. It has been a good thing to see. See all these names. Now we,

Speaker 3:          01:31:10       we know the names too, like addresses we can find. You know where you live. It's really bad ass when you stop and think about it. I just need to sleep on your couch. It's so unusual. You know, I really stop and think about it. How often does, does a band get to do that? I mean the rolling stones never got a chance to do that when they were coming up. You know who gets chance to do that? No, but they hung out with the hell's angels and no big deal. Is that okay? That's a substitute we need to do is we need to get a motorcycle gang behind us and I think that's just like straight to the tippy top that gets like people stabbed. You gotta be

Speaker 5:          01:31:43       careful with that shit. I mean, it's not so bad. Just kidding. I got

Speaker 7:          01:31:49       jokes through. This is kind of a weird, maybe terrible thing I got through the airport. Security with a knife. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:31:54       Somebody else just told me the exact same thing I did. I had, I realized he was in my Jack and I said,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       fuck I do you carry a knife. 40 domestic. The gift. You're getting crazy. It's a gift from out of town. Maybe I have to shit on the fucker. When you're a jet, you're a jet for life. Exactly. I will snap. Switched plays making a comeback. Yes. I carry a knife on me all the time. Do you really? Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:32:15       It's it, you know what, like when your package is a really hard to open to them, you walk to your car, you want to open something, you got a little thread on your code. Just listen. Don't think I don't appreciate it. If I was a chick that'd be armed as fuck. You know, I, I didn't really think about it as much until I moved to Nashville and I, I'm alone a lot of the time. So it's like, nevermind. I'm fine. I'm totally armed. I have a big dog. It's just pulled their pants off. Dude, I'm fucking a lot of time. When did you start?

Speaker 4:          01:32:46       If from the beginning, oh, Suzanne, please stop. That's my giant only redneck that sees you at the supermarket. I want to fight to the death if I have to, you know, like how your role, oh, you gotta do what you gotta do. It's getting hard. Cool. Living in Nashville is a

Speaker 5:          01:33:05       better, worse, different. I, I'm going to say better. Better in the sense that, uh, from, uh, you know, uh, I'm here to play music vibe. Like you get so much more for your dollar. It's a very affordable town. There's incredible musicians on every corner that are welcoming and inspiring and helpful. And like we, we have all these friends that help us with like just getting integrated and we, um, I really like it. It's funny, I was, I was telling Red van earlier, he's like, how are you doing? And I was like, you know, I'm great and I love La. I really do. But like the minute I got on the 10 and I was stuck in traffic, I was in a foul mood really? Well, yeah. I just like, I wanted to get here, I want him to go pick up band across town. And like, it was just, it was funny, like it took so long to get here.

Speaker 5:          01:33:53       I left at 1230. Wow. And I dunno, there's just something about Nashville that I really, the, our, our productivity, like your energy you have, I have more energy. I go to the YMC a like four times a week, I mean things or look at this, it's happening. So you have more time, more time. Much more time. But why is that? I'm used to so much slower there just in general. And it's a smaller town. There's not as many people. We know fewer people you can get around easier. Yes. Ben Lives like a mile and a half for me, which is nice. So again, you guys are moving to new place. Why don't you move right next door to each other. You're crazy. Why not create such a little community? Well you are right next door to each other. Yeah, I mean we're, I, I couldn't tell you the last time I want a day without seeing it like a whole day. How's that feel? It feels great. I think you're really great. I think you're really funny and you're so smart and talented and good looking

Speaker 4:          01:34:46       full on. Wow. Great Body. Okay. You guys rolling? Beautiful. She's got ugly. Do you have to resist that? Do you have to resist the, I mean you think we should talk about it for a long

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       time to have to resist romantic urges? I'm just, no conversation is going gay these days. No need to have this conversation. Ben's revisiting his life. It's odd though to, to have a, a man woman sort of equal partnership like this in a band that works and nobody winds up cam pregnant. Oh my God, God, I'm so not ready for that. You know? I mean you guys are like bandmates really good friends. It's a, that's a weird position for a man or a woman to be like really good friends, isn't it? In this day and age it's very happy.

Speaker 5:          01:35:33       You know, it's diff. It's difficult in a lot of different ways because you know, for the significant others that we date. Yeah. That's like a, that's a big one too. Cause we're so close. I mean we and creativity together is a very intimate thing. So, um, you know, it's, it's a, it's a rough road being a musician in general because like you either date someone in your band or you date someone not in your band that you never see or you're with someone that you see every day. There's like this like

Speaker 3:          01:36:07       fine line. Do you ever, did you ever date a guy? He's like, the fucking Ben Guy. Never know. And that would be ridiculous. That would be like, oh, why would I want to date someone who didn't like my best friend and be like, yeah, unless he was a Chippendale, I might make some reparations. Yeah, she was a child. Just those guys from that night. If you can just relay it to be short lived relationship, let me tell you. Oh listen, that's what you're looking for. What are you trying to do? Trying to fix the world. Trying to have a good time. Okay. What are you gonna do? Establish a Topia. I start a new community. Know you can get your freak out with a bunch of fucking shave dudes. That's the problem. A little baby oil and a big party. The smell of Suntan lotion in the air, right?

Speaker 3:          01:36:51       God, it's so funny. Like shavers, all of the fellows. How does that, I'm white as goat cheese. This is just like, it's amazing. I couldn't get a tan to say my life. No, I've tried it didn't, it didn't work out well. Nothing. We're gone burn. I burn. Yeah. You have dark hair? I do, yeah. What is your nationality? Italian. I'm a, I'm a papa side and my mom is native American, Indian and European, Huh. Yeah. So I'm going to live forever and be an alcoholic. Hello. Kidding. It was not the case like the, do you find it runs in your community? Absolutely. Yeah. I mean gift court, first of all, who's family? I want to know. It doesn't have alcoholism but boring people. But I mean it's, it's true. Like

Speaker 5:          01:37:40       every, every culture has their physical relationship to it. Um, genetically speaking. Um, and I believe that the, I'm a lightweight as much as I love to drink. Like I'm, I'm kinda good after two drinks, I'm pretty warm. I, my voice, my gets louder. Um, you know, I start taking my clothes off. That was a lie. Um, uh, in, in the most fucking classy kind of way. Bros, that's all I know about that for the most class. You kind of way period. But um, anyway, yeah, I hope, I hope that I said that well and it was not offensive.

Speaker 4:          01:38:15       Do you find is easy to make friends in Nashville? You guys like meeting people and enjoy it warm? It's an unusual town. Isn't it? Yeah. And it's so, it's, I never realized how huge Ellie was until you go to Nashville and it really is a small town. Like we'd go out, we were there two weeks and he'd go out and you're seeing people that should know, um, and you can get across town in 15 minutes and everybody's just kinda wants to hang. It's like a big sitting on the porch beer drinking community. Yeah. It's like, I think that when towns get too big and there's a lot of great things about La, there's a lot of, I mean there's so many great restaurants are so many places to go. All my friends live here. I love La, but I really like smaller towns. I really loved living in Boulder. I really love Portland. I know, I really love Nashville, Nashville span ass. And there's like, um, a better vibe. There's like, like, oh, the frequency in the air is less intense. It's not death metal. It's like fucking piano music. You know what I mean? It's like you can relax a little, like the frequency of the actual city itself. You go to New York. Okay. New York is, it's red line. Everywhere you go on,

Speaker 5:          01:39:26       there's too many people.

Speaker 4:          01:39:27       No way to avoid that. It's a crazy fucking town. You could, you could take you an hour to drive across that stupid island, you know, a whole hour easily, easily, which should take you a minute, you know, just take you one minute, I tell you. So that kind of stress is going to definitely affect people socially and you don't get that in like a place like Nashville. And that in itself is better. And I ended, it feels like the pace of everything is slower so you can get more, I dunno if you take advantage of it, you can get more accomplished because there's not this constant scurrying, but you feel like you have to, or at least I haven't felt like I had to do in La. It was like get to hear, get to hear. Good to hear, good to hear. And then nothing would actually come with any of these. No, I feel that I feel that constant scoring you. You know, I've had friends like Eddie Bravo, he used to live in west Hollywood and he liked living in West Hollywood because he felt like when he lived there the pace was like a faster pace because everyone is doing things. It made him feel like you had to get up and get things done. That's the last shit I need. You know, I do not want it.

Speaker 5:          01:40:31       Well it's kind of like a, you have to get up and get things done and then you can't get there on time cause you have to wait. That's a difficult thing to, to digest. Do you guys do any wean covers? No. We talked about piss up a rope last time we were here. Where did she when you were two cheese go. Oh that's great. I love cheese. I love cheese. You know it's a sad thing about

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       cheese. Oh no Joe don't tell him fucking country people are not allowed to use unpasteurized milk to make cheese. You have to pasteurize the milk and homogenize it and boil it down and kill all the stuff that makes the cheese tastes good. You ever have cheese in Europe? Kind of cheese in France. You have some non homogenized cheese and France from an old like the cheesemaker. Some mother fucker really knows what they're doing and you can get it in America. I mean don't get me wrong, there's places and we used to get some really delicious cheese. Um, there's a place in Beverly hills, it's like it's a straight cheese place and I know they probably, it's probably like a Cuban cigars sort of a thing. Like you can get Cuban cigars, be got to know people, they're going to know you first and then they slip you the non homogenized non pasteurized cheese access in Los Angeles.

Speaker 4:          01:41:44       Do you ever have a raw milk? Do you ever drink raw milk? It's delicious and it's so good. It's just okay. Raw milk with cookies. You cannot go wrong. Warm. A little curt with some bad ass fucking straight from the teeth getting on the lap of an elderly man. Cubic cares if you get some bad ass cookies. Okay. Some really good like Nestle's tollhouse type bitches. Like what does that, what does that would, that place of the airport where you go to [inaudible] house, cookies. Botches type of honeypot. What is the fucking no nuts in them on the, um, those cookies. There was like the, there's like a fucking famous cookie chain. There are amazing cookies. Got, I can't remember famous name now. Older neighbors are pretty good, but there's like cookies. He get like, they're always at the middle. Mrs Field. Yesterday you go Mrs. Fields, take a few of those chocolate chips and you know what?

Speaker 4:          01:42:40       I'm going to find them as this fields in this area in Pasadena, and we're going to go there after this fucking show. I need some cookies. You can't go. You gotta get the Hollywood look. What's happening? How are you like, oh my, my comedy special comes out tomorrow, Ladies and gentlemen. Uh, tomorrow it comes out on Joe rogan.net. If you go to Joe rogan.net, it's a available, we were having a problem with the Amazon thing. It's, um, it was supposed to be ready today, but it's not. So hopefully it will be ready by tomorrow, but if not the paypal thing, we'll definitely still be ready. I like it to be ready with Amazon. So you could do that one click, which is awesome by the way. I'm a huge Amazon one click proponent. Um, so it'll be on Joe rogan.net. It'll be there too. That's what it's gonna look like.

Speaker 4:          01:43:19       You know, you got to enter in all your nonsense. And the, uh, the special something that I, I paid for it entirely myself, uh, Louis C K style. I did a essentially exactly what he did. Um, I'm releasing it for five bucks. Uh, I think what he did like by setting that price, it's like really smart. I think it's really cool. And you know, Louise, one of the best comics in the country, why would you ask for more? Don't put, don't be plants and how to stop that shit. I know what it is. It's my show, but it's available, uh, tomorrow. Um, and then there's like a whole thing that I paid for it. And please don't steal it. You know, of course certain people are going to steal it. You're going to, but uh, it's, uh, I think it's a reasonable price. I think, uh, I think this sort of model like what we were talking about with Radiohead would they did and allowing people to pick their own, I think stop playing my shit, dude.

Speaker 4:          01:44:09       I wasn't playing city. It's kind of cool to look at the quality. It's dare you know, it's great. Positive image video did it at the same people that produce the UFC shows. Um, and my friend Anthony Giordano, he's the director of it and he's the one who did my last one talking monkey's in space too. And uh, we, you know, I'm real excited to do it this way for a couple reasons. One, I think it's the best way to distribute things, to distribute them online and to do it directly to your fans instead of having to go through comedy central or any of these other, for comic, like to have an outlet to release your stuff. There's, there's only a few options. You could do an HBO thing or a showtime thing or I know, and like unfortunately you have to actually sit down with people when you do that and they have to decide what you, what they like about your material, what they don't like and that shit, that shit is whack.

Speaker 4:          01:44:56       Okay. That is like the worst thing about being a comedian is when you go to release your stuff and there's other people that have a say or want to have a saying in the actual content. It's crazy. It's that. It's the, they're the dumbest conversations I've had. People get upset at the dumbest shit. It's, it's really, it's, it's mind boggling and it's unnecessary. And I think one of the things that is really important about art is a, whether it's, um, a standup comic or someone who writes something or whatever it is. I love, uh, an individual's unique point of view. I love seeing the way a person puts it together. You know, whether it's perfect or not, if it comes from you. I liked that. I liked knowing that you wrote all your jokes. I like knowing that you thought all these thoughts that you printed all those words.

Speaker 4:          01:45:47       I want to be connected with your, your thoughts, your creativity, your consciousness. And the only way to do that is for a person to release their own shit. Period. You know, whether it's a band released their own shit or a comedian to release their own shit. As soon as you have some executive type characters interfering with your creative process, you're fucked. You know, you just are, they, that's not what they're supposed to be doing. But when they can, they will, they get their dirty little greasy fingers, all of your shit, and they fuck it up inevitably. And uh, I guess that's not necessary anymore. Um, because of, uh, this podcast, we've essentially cut out doing most radio shows. I mean a occasionally do radio, but it's not like every week. Like I used to have to do it. It's, I don't have to do as many different interviews.

Speaker 4:          01:46:32       You can talk directly to the people that enjoy what you do. And this is, these are crazy times, you know, this podcast alone has changed my life chains. Brian's life changed Ari's alive. Duncan's life. Joey's life changed all our lives. We're, we're in a weird place right now. And, uh, I think the only smart thing to do is just keep going in the same direction. That's why I got this new studio set up and that's why were releasing things on line like this. And that's why we're all touring and we're all continuing to write material. And you're special by the way, is outright now. You could actually buy it this second, right? This is right second. Yeah. I'm not supposed to say that because they're trying to get everything in order, especially get the Amazon Shit corrected. But if you want to get crazy, go ahead and buy it.

Speaker 4:          01:47:16       Download it. It's supposed to be up. Yeah, I mean, again, like I said it and don't say sorry. You didn't know. How did you know? Uh, yeah, but tomorrow it's official. So wait for tomorrow if you'd like fucking opening up your presence in the morning. If you want to list those dudes is still believes in Santa. Wait until tomorrow. Okay. If not, yeah, you can go fucking get it right now. Five Bucks, please don't steal it. Okay. I paid for the shit constantly. More than a hundred thousand dollars to film. It's very expensive, but, well you did professional style. Yeah, no, I didn't fuck around. And we did it at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, which is a beautiful historic theater. It's an amazing, amazing theater. And uh, it was important for, I haven't been to Atlanta and a couple of years, so it was important to do it somewhere where I hadn't been for a while to cover, you know, to I, I don't, I hate getting emails from people like wouldn't fuck you coming back to Vancouver.

Speaker 4:          01:48:06       Trust me, I want to come back to Vancouver. I just don't, I haven't had a chance. So that was an Atlanta sort of a situation. So it was really cool to be able to do it in Atlanta. And Atlanta is a, does not get enough credit. That is a bad ass fucking town. I love Atlanta and it's one of the like the most diverse like racially diverse towns, Atlanta's miles places where you see like a lot of black dudes wearing suits. Like a lot of like eight or shoes. Yeah, like expensive clothes and you know, driver like it's weird thing. It's like there's a lot of like black professionals in Atlanta. It's like the uh, the level of interaction between white people and black people. It's way higher in Atlanta. And uh, that's, that's a fucking real problem with La. You know, I'll, La is first of all like kind of segregate and second of all, it's such a car culture that people don't really, it's not like on the subways in New York, people will mingle black people mixed with white people.

Speaker 4:          01:49:00       Everybody gets together, people from different, all sorts of different economic groups are altogether. That's in La. That's not the case in la. There's like a lot of haves and have nots. It's a lot of separation and everyone's driving, so no one's like on a train with a bunch of young kids. So it's different sort of a vibe. I think we miss out because of that. You know, the idea that, you know, he'd get a little more, a little less crime that way and you know, it's a little safer that way, but you miss out on a little bit of the whole experience of being a human and Atlanta. It's a slot, a lot of mixing going on. It was cool. You know, I liked it. So a lot of black guys with white checks, a lot of that. So a lot of that. I saw her, a bunch of white dudes of black chicks too.

Speaker 4:          01:49:44       It was, it was an interesting place. I dig Atlanta, but it was a really cool place to my special jackals. Great. Yeah, it's pretty dope. And that's the name of the special, it's live from the tabernacle because a, I'm not that creative and I couldn't come up with a better name. That's all I had in my wheel house. I searched, I found nothing. I decided to just release it. So talk from talking monkey's in space to live from the last one I ran out of my good names. Do you do once he released his specialty, stopped doing that material? Why? Yeah. I mean maybe a rare occasion if someone yell something out, I will do it just for fun, you know? But it's over. Yeah. I've got to let that shit go. Move on to the next material. That's why, uh, first of all it's what people are like, why did it take so long to release this?

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       Because we filmed it on four 20 in the April. So part of it took that time because I had a new website that just went live last week and it takes a long time to get like a professional website design company to build like exactly what you want. And you know that just the website traffic has been so crazy that it's gotten to a point where I needed something that was like a little bit more robust and a little bit more functional and then incorporating the podcast into it. And we're, we're working on a totally new podcast website now and that's like the next step. But it's, it's the whole podcast thing is just, it's, it's gotten so out of control. It's almost like, I don't know how Brian, if you feel about the same way I do, but I always feel like we're like on a fucking little boat on top of some crazy wave.

Speaker 4:          01:51:10       And we're like, Whoa, what do we need to do? We need for a fucking rafts. Okay, let's get rafts. You know, like when we, when we buy shit for the studio, it's always like, what do we need? Oh, I need more of this shit. We need more of that shit. And it just seems to be kind of grown on its own and we're just kind of keeping up with it. You know, this is a part of it. So, you know, these shows that we do, uh, when I, whenever I ask people like, how many guys listen to the podcast? It, what about a year end? It was about 50% and now it's like a hundred percent. Now it's crazy. And, uh, we're having the fucking time of our lives. I just want to tell you guys, as much as you, people are enjoying it, we get these emails, we get these tweets and texts messages.

Speaker 4:          01:51:52       I get these emails every day that tell people or are people telling us rather that the podcast has changed their life and change the way they think about things and the conversations we've had with people like Dennis Mckenna yesterday, I talked to a guy today who told me listen to it five times already came out yesterday. You know, it's like, it was such a crazy fucking conversation. We are just as you are, we're growing with these conversations as well. There's no other way. Brian and I would have had the opportunity to sit down with all these people and have these conversations with them. They wouldn't just be willing to come meet us somewhere and sit down for three hours a day if I was just subdued and lived in a castle somewhere. But I need to converse with this man, bring him to me. The only way you can really have a, a car, it has to be worthwhile for them to so they can get their message out.

Speaker 4:          01:52:42       So it's, this whole thing has been a real symbiotic exchange. So, uh, when you guys, I can't say it enough, people keep telling me, you know, hey, this podcast changed. You're changed my life. I, I've heard it before and I appreciate the fuck out of it every time. And there's no other way to say it, you know. Um, we're, we're blown away by this whole thing. We appreciate it. Is this like love music in the background? I've had the time of my life. Uh, Sam is that dirty dancing? Yes. Oh, was beautiful. But there was two hours put baby in a corner. Okay. All right. So Joe rogan.net. Go get it. It's available on paypal and a, I think Amazon and um, hopefully Amazon's already by today. It was supposed to be. If it's not, it should be around tomorrow, but um, that's it. All right. Go Fuck yourself or not. I don't care honey. Honey, honey. Honey, would you like play another song? Honey?

The people that we, we, we've talked to so many people that say thank you for turning us on the honey honey, Twitter and they're awesome. Isn't that cool? It's so great. It's so good. I don't know what happened, man, but we have the coolest fucking people in the world that are connected to us. I really don't get it. I don't, I don't know how it took place. It's an amazing lack of douchebags staggering the actual douche numbers to cool people numbers. It's crazy. It doesn't exist anywhere else on the earth. We're creating utopia. It's pretty cool and we appreciate it. Listen, we, we appreciate you guys. You guys are awesome. You're incredibly talented and like I said before, we do whatever the fuck we can to promote you guys.

Speaker 5:          01:54:54       Thank you. Well, speaking of, I want to say that we have a show in Cleveland, my hometown on a 1220 sixth that's the day after Christmas at the House of Blues in downtown and I feel like it's like only half full right now off of Cleveland in the, in the area were headlining. So we're going to play for a nice, nice chunk of time. When you guys do a headline said, how long do you play for? I think they're going to do 70 minutes. Yeah, 70 75

Speaker 4:          01:55:19       that's a good number. I'd like to do that on standup too. When I do more than that, I feel like I'm testing people's pain there. Their attention. They're like enough, dude. How much more you want to attention?

Speaker 5:          01:55:29       Well, we talk a lot too. You know, there's a lot of, this is just, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:55:33       do you guys have like Paul Stanley type banter? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:55:36       Like, like Paul Stanley from kiss. Oh. I was like, is that a committee? I thought it was that guy. There was like,

Speaker 9:          01:55:47       oh no, we never see that. Brian pull, pull some of that up. Paul Stanley introducing for kiss before we play this song. Paul Shaffer. No. Paul Stanley from Kiss Paul Stanley talks to the audience. It's great. No, you have to do it. You have to be totally fucking cheesy. Yeah. Paul tally talks to the audience. This is a short video of Paul Stanley talking and playing with the audience at a kiss alive. 35 concert.

Speaker 9:          01:56:17       That's a we should do, but that's just, that's Peter. Chris, Paul Stanley does. They've made cds out of it and the dude, whoever you are that's made those cds. I forget your name. Thank you very much. Guy sent me a stack of them. They're hilarious. It's all Paul's down from in between songs. Shit. It's like super duty brute.

People know you're an old Jew when you're, you're calling a guy schmuck and you don't have a shirt on. Try to find that one. He talks to the audience. Yeah, that's just so they could get rid of some douchebag.

Speaker 3:          01:57:09       Is that it was amazing. Yeah. How about that one? What was that one? Oh, that's another one. It's all making fun. Anyway, my point is I have no point. That's my point. My point is he's a hell of a show him in that Paul Stanley got it.

Speaker 9:          01:57:25       Smart guys. Those kisses. They made a lot of money though.

Speaker 3:          01:58:27       He's Russian. He's a mail order bride. Easy, easy. Talking about mom and dad here in the Fox. So you listened to classic shit. It's like, yeah, well I'll listen to like, he would start, you know there's an opera

Speaker 7:          01:58:42       called the magic flute. Yup. That's gone there. This is Mozart, Mozart opera, couple of magic flute. He played every single weekend. So we'd just be blasting heat blasted, like he was playing ACDC. But yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:58:52       Really? Wow. Every, every weekend. Yeah. Can't remember that.

Speaker 7:          01:58:58       And then, um, what did he get you into playing music? No, not really. Neither of them did. They didn't really play that much, but I don't know where it started, but I just decided I want to play violin first. And I played violin when I was like six and I dropped it. And then I started playing drums and from there on it just kind of freaked out about it and go. So from age six, you started with

Speaker 8:          01:59:18       violin? Yeah. Wow. I can't play it at all anymore. No. It's a shame. I feel like actually it would come back if I really put it in the time to give it a whirl. Yeah. I think no, I'm not serious. I believe in you. I think you can do it too. Mike am my chip came out of rocky. There is no tomorrow. Um, what about you Suzanne?

Speaker 5:          01:59:41       How'd you start? Um, well I listened to a lot of like juxtapose with my folks a ran an Italian restaurant, so I grew up with a lot of like jazz, like Rosemary Clooney and Frank Sinatra and we pre month, stuff like that. Um, and I like that a lot. And then like regular, like nineties rock pop, like Scorpions. My mom, no, my mom was to rock set. There was a lot of rock set in the car. What's rocks at? Um, oh God. Um, w what's their song? Hold on. It'll come to me. Fucking a red bands. Where we at here there was, oh God, we're upset. It'll come. Hold on. But there's, there's rock set. Yeah. Well how does it go? Uh, you're trapped. The villa. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:00:31       Is there anything in fucking medicine in it? None of it was that song. Yes. So there's that. Like my, my mom was the more sort of contemporary culture. My Dad and I used to listen to a lot of journey together and harmonize you guys just to harmonize together. I remember actually stop. It was crazy and I'd be like, you take the hi. And he'd be like, no,

Speaker 5:          02:00:56       dad would sing journey together. And My dad played some, some acoustic guitar. Oh, you know, he, he really like Jethro Tull a lot. And Hailey. Yeah, he was, you know, he, he had a band in the 70s and mustache and a perm. Whoa. Your Dad's pretty, pretty hip. That guy. Did he have bell bottoms? I hope not, but yeah, of course. No, I'm sure he did. Yeah. There's all these pictures of my, My, my dad and my grandfather and my uncles and they, they look like Italian mobsters. Like they just, everybody has like, everything's like together. There's like tailored suits and like glass, big glasses and that's just the 70s now retiring Elton John Glasses. Totally. It was totally gay. Yeah. But um, time the 70s or so, it's like they got

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       disconnected from the mother nipple of drugs. You know, it's like in the 60s they all had an acid and marijuana and mushrooms and then the 70s like, oh, what are we going to do? Stay sober man, lose pills, pills, confused. Motherfuckers started wearing pointy shoes and bell bottoms, big belt buckles. What am I doing? I don't what happened back then. Dudes for the most part had such, there was such a wardrobe wise speaking, they were so much more of an effort put into what guys would wear on a regular basis because they didn't have match.com couldn't just find people online. You get to pretend to be something you weren't, you had to go somewhere and wear the outfit and do whatever you could get someone to touch you. Jesus Christ. What do I have to like, do I have to dance? You know, men are essentially junkies and they're, they're born into this world junkies and then they go out as young men with full raging hormones and it's this massive quest to figure out how to get someone to touch you.

Speaker 4:          02:02:47       And what do I have to do? How, what do I have to pretend I have to talk a certain way, cut my hair a certain way. Let me just get that figured out first. And every man is struggling with that from the time where young, when we're 16, 17, 18 the conversations we have is all about how we figure it out. How to fucking get them to like us. Yeah. Well that's what breeding is all about. If it wasn't for that sense of urgency, there'd be three people on the planet, you know, you'd have to, the only reason why we do it is because we are junkies. We're just so crazy. Just get rid of the loads. Just get him in there. Quite so many touch. Right? And so there you go with bell bottoms, fucking confusing wardrobe things. It takes like 10 years for people to go.

Speaker 4:          02:03:31       What the fuck are we doing? Yeah. What the fuck are we doing? These things looks too, but it's fun. You're right man. Fuck Bell Bottoms, pants are still here. Okay. Pants work. Everybody's cool with genes. Genes have been around since fucking, you know, butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid at the same jeans that you wear there wear jeans. They were canvas, which is interesting. Most clothes and pants during like the minor days, the cowboy days were actually made with cannabis. They were made out of hemp. Yeah. Most clothes. Yeah. Well before the, um, the, the, before slavery was illegal, that's what most shit was made with the, they made more close with, uh, with hemp and more flags and sales. All that stuff is made with hemp because it's much, much stronger than cotton. And then when Eli Whitney came along and made the cotton gin, oh, then it became really easy to make shit with cotton.

Speaker 4:          02:04:23       And then the decorticator was invented in the 1930s. In the 1930s was right after prohibition for alcohol had ended. And they were trying to figure out what to do with all these fucking drug enforcement agents that were assigned to go after alcohol. And one of the things they did was a concerted effort between this Guy William Randolph Hearst that owned all the newspapers. We also owned all these paper mills and the cover of Popular Science magazine had this article hemp, the new billion dollar crop. And so everybody was switching over to hemp cause they had created this decorticator which allows you to effectively processed to hemp fiber, the stalk of the plant, which is like credibly useful for making paper and close it. It allowed you to process it without slavery, allows you to process it like an economically effectively. And so William Randolph Hearst started printing all these articles about marijuana and about how marijuana was causing blacks and Mexicans to rape white women.

Speaker 4:          02:05:22       So that's how they shut down the hemp business. It was all about hemp as a commodity. It wasn't about cotton interests his own. He was protecting paper because he owned paper mills. He was a, um, uh, also dupont had an interest in it because dupont came up with the chemical composition for nylon to make ropes. And previously all ropes had been made at a hemp. So there was, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's readily available. You can get it online. It's amazing. That is very impressive. It's just memory. That's all it is. It's just, look, you asked me shit about important things, like where are your taxes go? I don't really know that. We don't want to know. You should know or be our overlords are lying to us, but that's the only reason why it's still legal today or it's still legal today is now it's gone from a textile and uh, you know, in a, in an issue with like nylon, now it's gone to pharmaceutical drugs and the influence of pharmaceutical drugs.

Speaker 4:          02:06:20       The only reason why it's, and then there's also people that would profit from it being illegal. Like prison guard unions actively spend money to try to keep marijuana, illegal private prisons. They will actively try to spend money to keep marijuana. And we didn't go because they want to keep the prison stock cause that's what they make money. Not Amazing. Yeah. Private prison unions, prison guard unions spend money to make sure that drug stay illegal. That's cute. Isn't that cute? Because they make money. I mean it literally is like slavery. I mean if it wasn't illegal, those people wouldn't be in jail. They'd be free. So you make something that they do and you spend money to keep it illegal. Something enjoy it. It doesn't hurt anybody else. You spend money to keep it illegal so you can enslave them and make money from the fact that they're locked in a cage that you own mass incarceration. That's amazing. Gary. We're going to look back on this day in, in the future when people are, when they have full access to everything including thoughts and all, all misinformation will be accounted for and corrected. We will look back with great shame and how stupid we ran this world. We will look back at it with great shame at the people that we

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       called our leaders and what a group of fucking monkeys they are. When you see them arguing about the fiscal cliff and all this other nonsense, you realized these are incredibly flawed human beings from a different time and an error and they're all trying to appease these fucking monsters that put them into position. These, these, these corporations, they spend millions of dollars in associate pathic way to try to profit from these fucks representing them. We're going to look back on this and we're going to be really, really shocked that we were this week. We're going to be really shocked that it was this pathetic with our incredible access to information that we were still this wonky with our system of government and our system, money and welfare and and, and, and protecting each other and our sense of community in our willingness to go into wars. We're going to look back on it. It's going to be shocking. Just as shocking as the inquisition.

Speaker 5:          02:08:31       Don't know what they're doing. You know? I think that it's, it is, it is a joke to see how, how the world is run or a country or whatever. Sometimes. Not all the time, but you know, I don't think that it, it's, it goes like under their radar. I think it's just like politics and selfishness.

Speaker 1:          02:08:52       It's damp and it's also completely out of control. It's so big. Like the system is so interconnected. There's hundreds of different organizations. There's more than a hundred different countries. There's all this fucking politics. There's a certain amount of natural resources that they need every fucking day. There's so much is going on. There's so many different connected issues and does so many fucking human beings. It's so hard. It's like people were born into this system. It's completely chaotic. It's completely out of control, completely corrupt. And it's like everybody agrees. Everybody looks at it and says it's a mass, but no one knows what to do. And they try to work within the system to fix it, but that doesn't seem to be working. So it's like our options are wait for it to completely fall apart and come up with something totally new or slowly sort of chip away at this horrible problem that our ancestors have created and left us with because that's the real issue.

Speaker 1:          02:09:48       It's like you and I and we, we never, we didn't create this world. We didn't decide to invade Afghanistan and we say we are going to war with Iraq. We have nothing to do with that. The fact that some human beings that somehow or another represent us cause we're all in this one patch of dirt together, his car Raese and it's always been crazy. It was crazy when the Romans did it. It's crazy when the Greeks did it, but it's even more crazy when we do it. It's more crazy when we do it because we have, we have the access to the information that allows us to see the wiring under the board and see what's really motivating this whole thing and see where this is all going from. And it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing with there were so dumb that this is, these are our leaders at guys like Newt Gingrich really think there could be president. It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. Oh, of it that a guy like Mitt Romney can have this incredibly horrific record in business and still put himself up as a businessman for the people and almost get elected, but just as crazy, the guy like Obama can win the Nobel Peace Prize then send 30,000 more people with guns to Afghanistan. Fucking crazy. We're crazy shit.

Speaker 7:          02:11:01       Yeah. Circumstances. Circumstances are right. It's, it's such a, it's just like an endless, it's like that not, what's that thing? That Gordian knot or whatever we just talking about it. There's that story about Alexander the Great and he has this, not that no one can untie. It's just this endlessly complex knot and you can't cut it actually that, that's what he did. He just sliced it in half and destroyed this Gordian knot.

Speaker 1:          02:11:26       I've never heard of that Gordian knot.

Speaker 7:          02:11:28       Yeah. Um, and you have these people, I don't know. It's, wow. It's the first time I've ever heard that. Um, you're dealing with this infinitely complex situation and you still have humans that are trying to solve it. Yeah. So I dunno. I think sometimes there's sometimes there's a lot of energy put towards, you know, defaming the people in power and sing and I'm not, I'm not a supporter of a lot of the people that you're talking about are the systems that govern, but I think it was interesting like this last week, sorry to get back on this, but the shooting thing and there's this knee jerk reaction that comes from a place of anger with a lot of people and I think that ends up just being wasted energy. And when people just start spouting off about how you know, things are, are, aren't the way they should be and reacting angrily, it takes away energy from changing individual lifestyles, which is the only thing we can really do. Right? Like, that's the only thing that you can change is how you're living your life and your usage of these resources that are basically the reason why we're in all these difficult situations because of the way we live. Our lives, takes up x amount of resource from, you know, Afghan Joe. So we have to go in there and take his stuff and create, you know, complicated situations we can't get out of. Right. You know, I dunno, I'm, I'm just rambling here.

Speaker 1:          02:12:53       No, no, no. I agree with you in, in a lot of ways and I think that, um, I would hate to have to be, I think if you were elected president right now, you'd be fucked. I think anybody would be people, even with good intentions, I think there's so many things you have to deal with. There's so many pressures, so, so much going on and you know, as much as you want to be the voice of reason, you live in a fucking crazy world. The Pakistan still exists. Okay. So fucking completely disconnected country with nuclear arms and a hate for India, their next door neighbor and they're there. I mean, we had Shane Smith from vice.com and he's talking about how, you know, leaders from that part of the world have said they want to strap

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       themselves with nuclear bombs and clover and destroy their enemies, but they're fucking crazy. And this is 2012 and this is a reality that people have to deal with. You know, that's why you need navy seals. You need the army, you need the marines, you need, I mean, it sounds, people want it. They don't want to think that that's real. They don't want to think that you, you do need a military. You fucking need a military man unless you want your, your, your, your wife raped in the street by Chinese soldiers. And I'm not saying the Chinese want to do that, but I'm saying that that traditionally has been what human beings have done. That's what Gangas Kahn did. That's what the Romans did, is the Greeks did. People have been taking over people from the history, from the, for the first time people started writing things down.

Speaker 4:          02:14:11       It's a fucking series of stories about people taking over other people. That's what everybody's always done and if you don't protect the people, then that's most likely going to happen because we really haven't evolved enough to not to not have it happen. You know, it would be beautiful if everybody was all peace, love and Kumbaya, but the reality is if you actually pay attention to the news, there's a lot of non Kumbaya type shit going down all over the world. You know, you, you need a little bit of a military. The problem is you've got a military and then you have a bunch of people that decide, you know, fucking son his bitches over here and then we've got some oil and make a lot of money. Then you go 2012 I have no point to this and the this bitch and doesn't do any good. And the only, the only, the only thing you could possibly have was it somebody, maybe you could listen to me and run for president and make some sense. That's it. The young, the young people, the only people that you can change. You're not going to change Newt Gingrich, that all Kofi fuck, he's not going to take mushrooms. Well, you gotta do to Newt Gingrich. Hey, going to change new kangaroos. Yes, yes, yes. I slept with him. It freak out and have a heart attack, cut his dick off and drown himself in a bathtub. You go crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:15:19       No way to ah, no, that's no way to go. This isn't mean, there's no point to this. I mean, we've, we've had this conversation with a hundred different people a hundred different times and there's no,

Speaker 5:          02:15:29       I don't think that, um, I really get so uncomfortable talking about these things because I don't feel like I'm, I've informed myself enough to have a strong opinion. Um, but my instincts and just, I agree with you that it doesn't matter who's president. It's like you're, you're fucked because you've inherited is a mountain of Shit, you know? Um, for centuries I think that unfortunately, and I'm, I got forbid, but you know, I don't, I don't think that, um, you know, I think it's going to be something huge that's going to change everything. And I don't know what that is. I don't know if that's something catastrophic. I don't know if that's the aliens coming or whatever the fuck I, but something else would have to happen for anything to really change. I think it's happening right in front of our face. I think it's the Internet. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:16:20       If there's an alien. I think the aliens, the Internet, the, the, the, this, this alien entity that is created by humans that allows to connect

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       and exponentially grow together in some strange way that would never be possible without it to have access to information that will never be available and no one saw coming. No one saw it coming and it's a factor. It's an alien factor created by human beings. It's alien to the earth. It's alien to any of the systems that have been set up before as far as natural systems of natural selection, of, of, of survival, of the fittest. Any of those select. This is an alien system. This is an access to information in language. If the, if something happens with, what'd you say bro? If the,

Speaker 4:          02:17:06       like none of us have the know how most people, like if if the Wifi gets knocked out, you know what I mean? Like you lose all access to

Speaker 1:          02:17:13       no, that's true. I mean we look, but you know what? If you're, you're a juggler had slit, your blood falls out and you're done. You know

Speaker 4:          02:17:21       God, I hope the Internet. That's why I'm saying I need to think it's cultural. It's culturally my bows and arrows analogous to our blood. Which ones are the good berries in the bad berries? You know that ultimate fighter star with the that that broke his penis? Yes. Oh God, yes. Totally magical ray lb. Apparently he had a girl hopping up and down on his Johnson and she miscalculated her exit and reentry and it was tank to tip snapped his Penai

Speaker 1:          02:17:56       in the hospital for several days getting his shaft repaired and who knows if I've ever totally recover.

Speaker 4:          02:18:04       That's how, that's how I won. Ultimate fighter fucks that tendon dick tissue optic tissue. Yeah, it's officially dictation. I've never broken it, but I heard it a couple of times. Got It. You can't be, you can't let a strange girl doesn't know how long you penises ride you. Okay? You got to, you should hold firmly onto her waist and control her exit and reentry. You gotta be careful. You gotta be careful. You got to have a good grip on the waist and you got to do a lot of kettlebells tow. You want to be able to pick her up in case she gets crazy. You want to be able to

Speaker 1:          02:18:42       troll that thrust. It's very important, you know? I mean, a lot of girls would like to be on top. There's nothing wrong with that. Folks don't get wrong, but you men to protect your penis. Okay? And the way to protect your penis has a firm grip on the hips as gotta be a certain point where you're in danger. When they passed this, you know how long you, Dick is.

Speaker 4:          02:19:01       Okay? Don't get like bouncing up and down. That's the only way to break a dick. If he missed fired that fucking that is you would know you were doing, then you would stop while you're doing it. You wouldn't do it. It's still in. The only way to break a dick is a girl to be on top. I think that's 100% of all the broken decks I've come from. A girl being outside is a few off the bed falls and stuff like that. Yeah. Those guys are those natural selection. They're supposed to fall, landed on his dick. It's happened and then you broke it. That deck that's happened. Dude's tripped and landed on his dick and Jujitsu once. I used to not wear a cup and my God, that story again. You love the store. I go, I got kneed in the Dick like on the deck, like flat and my deck out.

Speaker 4:          02:19:45       Bam. Really hard by my friend Einstein, incidentally. Funny nickname. It's great guy. Anyway, it was, it wasn't his fault, it was just trying to pass my guard. He and he slammed his need and my dick and I didn't know I was hurt. I mean, I knew it hurt, but I thought it was okay. And, uh, you know, it's just like, ah, and then you know, you, you sit down for a minute or so and then he'd go back in when, when not in so much pain. But then when I went to the locker room after training, uh, I had blue shorts on and I, or blue pants on. I didn't know I took my pants off of my jock strip was red with blood. Oh my gosh. So my deck had been bleeding into my jock strap and then I peed and it came out of my Dick.

Speaker 4:          02:20:24       It was bloody. So then I have to figure out, okay, do I overreact here or do I treat it like I would treat my nose? Because if my nose, my nose is important to me, my nose is bloody, I would go to a doctor. So this is one of the things you have to do when you do Jujitsu on a regular basis, you're always getting hurt. It's all, you've got to know what the difference between a torn ACL is and you know, a, a cramp muscle, you know, so I had to figure out, so what I did was I decided I was going to masturbate. So went home. No, you, yeah, no, no. I went home and I was like, if I have a hard on, I'm sure my dick still works and so I'm good. So I got a hard on and a Jack [inaudible] and it looked like an embryo. It looked like, like the inside of an egg. No, no, I don't have much as a line. This is not online anyway, but, and it came out that way when a PD came out of the way for three or four days and it slowly, like less and less. So I was like, I kept touching it and make sure it's not effectives no pain. I checked my temperature, no fever, and everything's cool. There's no infection, so it's all right. Just took a few days off.

Speaker 4:          02:21:35       That was it. It healed up pretty sure it's okay. And I made a baby since then, so it's all good. I think I made both of my babies since then, so it's 100% fires, but it was a little scary, but it didn't look scary. It looked normal on the outside. That's why I was so confident. It wasn't like funny, swollen, felt better, didn't hurt. That was a crazy thing. It just blood was coming out of it. That is bizarre. Bizarre when you get need that big, oh that is from my dick didn't put it online. That's just blood. But it was really weird. But it was, it was also, I was like really questioning my own judgment. I was like, what did I just really just jerk off after I broke my Dick? A fuck is wrong with me. And I was like sitting there looking at the sink looking at this, you know? And I did it like in a medical sort of way. I didn't like sit in front of like a computer. Like Ah, Yay, fuck. He really had a stern look on your, I was like all medical shit. I'm sure I probably thought about like some ex girlfriend or something to get the job done. But it was,

Speaker 8:          02:22:41       you know, a clinical approach and everything. I wanted to make sure

Speaker 4:          02:22:45       that my dick worked. Did that disturb you and Nina Hartley was talking about wearing gloves when she was on [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          02:22:49       Kevin rather have a person where it glove and put his finger in her.

Speaker 4:          02:22:54       We have Nina Hartley on. Do you know who she is? Still old school porn star from like the eighties and she's still doing orgies and banging

Speaker 8:          02:23:01       people all over the world. I do know who that is.

Speaker 4:          02:23:09       She likes to, when people work gloves, she wears gloves and she wants them to wear gloves. Like mittens. Yeah, like big Christmas Santa Claus type gloves. She wants them to be clean. She wants everybody to be clean.

Speaker 8:          02:23:22       I don't blame her. I mean, I mean come on, you don't think you're going in there. Action photography thing. How dare you show my ass. How can we can show my ass on Ustream? But you can't show that the hookers tip because that's not your real, but you told me it's not my real bud. You know what? You guys were gonna play another song about it. I kind of like where this is. Go play one. It's called Dick Tissue Tissue. You guys have a song called Dick Shit. Tissue reset. No, no, no. I just don't know if I want to play this song. What song is this? It's a new song. It's a tender one. Can we talk about, can we like bring it down? Bring it down. I kept, my kids are awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:24:20       They're awesome. Yeah, I love them. They're fun. Great little girls, little tiny girls that I hang out with every day. A big part of my day is hanging out. I'm like, you like, yes. Do your children like no question. But uh, it's not just my children. It's also a little four year old individual who happens to be a girl and she's experiencing all these girl things and I want to be like, what the fuck? We're not going to go see that. I don't want to get to see that shit, but for whatever it is that she wants to go to, like we have to go see the Grinch like you have to like do it, will like get excited with her. Like do you want to go to the carousel?

Speaker 8:          02:24:57       Oh yes. I'll be so good. I want to ride a unicorn. Do you think the Unicorn will be available? Like I bet it will available.

Speaker 4:          02:25:05       Oh yeah. She's wicked smart. She's crazy smart, but it's like you, you get to see things through the eyes of a four year old girl. It's really interesting. It's fascinating. It's incredibly fascinating. I mean obviously I love her to death. She's amazing and I'm so happy just to having children. It's like a really incredible

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       experience. It's really hard to wrap your head around it and I don't recommend it to everybody and I don't recommend it to people who are in bad situations in their relationship or stressed out, but, but if you got your ducks in order and you're in a good place with a nice person, having a kid is a crazy experience when you're, you know, when you could just see it's going to be hard times. But when you get to hang out with this little person that you literally love more than you love your own life, like you would sacrifice your own life in order to keep them happy. It's a very strange thing. It's like as an entertainer, I'm sure you guys can relate to this, especially being around a lot of other entertainers, you guys are very balanced, but not a lot of us are. You know, a lot of us are very me, me, me, me, me, you know, and it's really hard to get past that. There's a lot of selfish ideas out there in the world of art and creativity. And one of the things that's been little really freeing to me is to actually have someone in my life, you know, have people in my life, not just one gang. These little people that I literally love more than I liked me. You know, I want more for them than for me. And that's, I always thought that was bullshit. I always thought that was what people said because they wanted to hear people go, aw, he's so sensitive. Oh he's so yoga.

Speaker 8:          02:26:38       You know what I mean? It sounds like horse shit. But then when you,

Speaker 1:          02:26:42       you understand the actual relationship between a parent and a child, it's not just a little human being. It's a little human being that is a part of you. I mean they, they, they literally, if it's not, you could never understand it unless it's yours. The, that biological switches that go off of very strange, you know, like, so your whole, your whole feeling about love in general changes when you have children and my whole outlook on human beings because once I had children, I changed the way I looked at everybody. I didn't, I don't look at adults as adults anymore. I look at adults as babies that became adults. I look at adults as like these bundles of potential that slowly but surely became a grown up human being. What are you playing to Brian? No baby. You play in babies eating and lemons. Have you given your babies the lemons yet? Yeah, they're like lemmings. They eat them. It's weird. Yeah. They make that face. Then they bite down chew.

Speaker 8:          02:27:47       There's a whole community of baby's eating lemon grass. It's okay because it's not painful, but it is kinda crazy. You know, like you don't feel like the kids getting tortured because look, they still ate it. They don't wipe their mouth or they just go, Whoa, that was a lie. A kid's a pussy. I kid freaked out from a wine lambs. Aren't even that bad. You little fuck. When I was a kid we had to walk 20 miles in the snow just to get a line. You feel like we are, we're in the right groove now. We might gotten there. All right.

Speaker 3:          02:28:21       What's this next song? Well, it's uh, it's, it's kind of called, it's got a weird name. I'm not sure if this is what we're going to call it, but the, the courses, which are you going to do now? And it's not like water, like spelling it out, you know? So like what, this is not even named yet. Not really. No. So to have a chance to hear a silence, not even name, maybe, maybe you can name it Joe, and that'll, that'll be, maybe we'll ask the people on Twitter, people on your stream, maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. We're not. We're not guaranteeing shit. But then you come up with the perfect name and Bennett, Suzanne Angle. Holy Shit. That guy. Fuck stick 69 cold blooded. He found it. He found the right navy balls of steel can help us out here. Balls of steel. Where are you? You introduced us.

Speaker 4:          02:40:02       PC way. We'll have you looked at it like what would you as a man, what would you choose? We have to wrap this up soon. What would you choose? Would you rather be the the man who dates the man who used to be a woman but is now a man or you know what I mean? Like fucking, I should ask Ben, would you rather be a date? Would you rather date of bucking Joe who's clearly very manly but has a vagina or like a little tie, little Thai boy, a twinkie type situation. That'd be careful who becomes a woman. You would rather have that right? Who would rather have a man who like at least looks like a woman? You're saying like a manly vagina having Ryan or a buck angels. Truly a man. Truly a man, but not really, really is a woman has a vagina. Would you rather have that or would you rather have a guy who used to be a guy but wanting to be a girl? Always felt he was a girl but really looks like

Ruined it. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       You son

Speaker 4:          02:43:14       of a bitch. Settle the fuck down. Okay. Uh, this show essentially is over.

Speaker 3:          02:43:22       This is a fun one. It got dark, but it was, that was good

Speaker 4:          02:43:26       being on it. You know, if, uh, if it wasn't for you guys, we probably would've never went down. The road of musical guests has been really fun.

Speaker 3:          02:43:35       Balls of steel, whatever it was, was it, he was in the fucking stars for us guys. Yeah, I think it was.

Speaker 4:          02:43:41       It was a, I mean the guy, if you don't know the story, a guy am I messed up or sent me a message, a personal message, said this is going to be a new favorite band. And it was you guys playing angel of death on the top of a roof somewhere and in la. And it was an acoustic version of it. And I was like, wow, these guys are fucking good. And then I just started, I think I saw my little toy gun. I think that was the next song I saw. And I just watched a bunch of your videos and I'm like, Holy Shit, these guys are awesome. And somehow or another we all got together and now we're besties.

Speaker 3:          02:44:09       It's pretty awesome. We are. I like what's happening here guys. It's beautiful. You know, this is one of the coolest things about the internet is the ability to connect people. The other cool thing, stalkers, that's not, oh, that's cool.

Speaker 4:          02:44:22       I'm being facetious. That's the problem with the ability to connect people. Some people are just not fully developed. They're not ready.

Speaker 3:          02:44:28       Can I know for others, not, not to segue from stockers at all because that was like a wrong place to go from. But I do want to have a little shout out and a thank you to all the amazing death squad fans that have come to our shows. There's some incredible people that we've met on our, on our, it'd be thanking a death squad during our travels and think about how weird that is. I'd like to thank the desk. Why can't you ever think those words would come here? I don't think I would know. Well, they never thought we would call ourselves a desk quad either. So why do you call them the death squad?

Speaker 4:          02:44:58       We're on the opiate Anthony show. What was it, 2006 or some shit like that. Yeah. And uh, oop, when we walked in, I walked in with Tate Fletcher's big giant dude from the ultimate fighter, good buddy of ours. And uh, Eddie Bravo who's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and Opie goes, oh, here's Joe Rogan. He brought in the death squad. Like, like there's these people that were killers and we just as a joke start a calling ourselves a desk squad, you know, because he said that. And then Brian started desk squad podcast network and it's sort of spread through that. And then Brian started selling the desk squad tee shirts and then people showed up at shows and they're all wearing these desk squad tee shirts and now people like put Hashtag [inaudible] Hashtag [inaudible] the yeah, it's crazy. And Brian does like desk squad shows, he calls it the comedy shows desk watch shows. It just was a crazy thing that sorta just grew and became weird

Speaker 3:          02:45:51       like our group of friends. But yeah, it's like our gang, you know like we're approving like if, if you're on the desk, why but we pretty much approve of your comedy or do physicians be in the dust? Why? That's great. That's great guys. 100% death squad approved unanimously voted now

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       herpes so happy. It's still, it's a noise but we don't really mean the connotation of those words to connect it together. Like death squad. It became something else. And even though it has that name, we don't think of any. There's no death involved. You know, there's no squad. It's like a bunch of silly happy people, you know, but they're just ironically call themselves desk with the Highland Kathy. That really does it tomorrow, Ladies and gentlemen will be our 300th mother fucking episode. Yes, you guys were to 99 and joining us tomorrow will be none other than the Great Joey Coco Diaz allegedly cock sucker. He never know what Joey, you never know what's going to happen. It's part of the fun and it's, it's also baby too. You never know if he's night. Joey Diaz, his wife is about to hatch. I'm knew Joey d a female. Joey Diaz, who will no doubt be the funniest girl in preschool.

Speaker 4:          02:47:09       It's going to come out of Joey. I took her to babysit their kid tonight. I'm cracking jokes right away. It's going to be very interesting. Joey will be with us Friday night at the Wiltern honey, honey, Joey Diaz, Doug's Stan hope and me. It's going to be awesome. And, uh, listen, I got all these emails from all these different people saying they're coming from all over the world. We appreciate the fuck out of that. And we're, we're very excited and I'm so glad that we, we, we, Doug and I talked about doing this probably in 2003 when we first started doing our shitty version of the man show and we said we should have an end of the world party and a, and we're doing it Joe rogan.net, my comedy special. It's already out. It's supposed to. I'm supposed to not talk about it til tomorrow, but a bunch of people have already saw it on Twitter while this podcast was going on and said they loved it.

Speaker 4:          02:47:48       Which uh, uh, I'm very happy here. I'm, I'm really happy for it. I don't, I would never put it out of its socket. I worked really hard on, this is like a good solid year of preparation and uh, and then it was a long time to set up the infrastructure to sell this and to be able to distribute it online. Uh, what Louis Ck did is a real game changer. It sort of changed the way a lot of people, especially the, certainly the way I think about it. Um, releasing things like this was never even an option or consideration until we started doing this podcast. So thank you very much. We appreciate it. The fuck out of you guys. We were all in this together. It's helping me as much as it's helping you guys. I swear to God, I'm gonna believe in God and I swear to him, I swear I believe in Odin and sent him praise.

Speaker 4:          02:48:34       Praise Odin. Ladies and gentlemen. It's not that I don't believe in God. Let me read it. Said I don't, I, I don't believe in him and I don't not believe in him. If he was there, I wouldn't be shocked. I wouldn't be shocked. Life itself is fucking crazy as an operating system could be. God could be the, the guy who programmed the simulation. It can be some autistic kid in Seattle, the fucking laptop. All right, you fucks. Look, we loved that Shit Outta Ya. We're sending out positive messages to you. Take them in and do with them what you will and we'll see you tomorrow. [inaudible].
