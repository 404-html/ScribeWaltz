Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, [inaudible]. Yes. We're live John Dudley. Phone away. And let's get popping. No, I got, I, I have some, some important subjects that I wanted to vent about. So did you put them on a little note? Yeah, I've got a notepad. I'm pretty good about doing homework. So I love your podcast. So listening through there is craft you talked about. I was like, Oh yeah, I got to get on. Are you got to bring it up? Yeah. So John Dudley, world famous archery coach. Uh, he's got a TV show. He's got a podcast, uh, found out about you because of the TV show first, the podcast Sacramento. I became obsessed with. If you're in the archery, like I know some of these people that are listening to this podcast, they get into archery because it sounds fun. Like, Ooh, maybe I need a new hobby.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       And then you go down that crazy rabbit hole. Well, what I found you, you're, you're down the rabbit hole like a few light years. You're gone, man. Freaking Johnny Depp. Then Johnny, you're gone. You're gone down though. The archery rabbit hole. I had no idea the rabbit hole goes so deep, but let's show this video. We're going to play this video. This is before John came up here. He did. Now I just set need to explain how difficult it is just to even hit a target at 100 yards. This is at a hundred. Yeah. One hundred yards is a football length of a football field and I'm gonna. Shut that thing off. It's just shut the volume off there. I'm 100 yards of length of a football field and for archery is just. It's so hard to hit something as wide as your wingspan at 100 yards for the average person, and so John made this ridiculous shot on one of the gorilla kettlebells from onnit. Yeah, this was a solo play. This here,

Speaker 2:          00:01:45       unbelievable challenge. I've got Joe Rogan's favorite workout tool. I've got an onnit kettle, Bell, primal and Kong is going to have to make a decision whether he's going to let this era pass or not. I'm going to try to put an Arrow through that two inch handle right there and actually at this distance of a hundred yards and the angle that arrows to come in, I bet it's even smaller. This is going to be an unbelievable challenge. Definitely going to have to defy the odds, my ideas. There it is right here on this shelf and I've got a curtain right behind so hopefully it'll stop the Arrow but also let it do its thing so that would capture all this on tape right at dark. I'm going to put an Arrow through a two inch gap and the handle if calm lets it pass.

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       There it is. Check it out. Just so ridiculous

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       that that actually went in that little hole at 100 yards. Did you have to try more than one attempt at. This was actually my first shot with everything set up because I had to do a little bit of homework. What I did was I knew I couldn't see the hole in the handle good enough to aim at it, so I actually cited my bow into where I hit four and a half inches high from Kong's face, so I literally aimed right at Kong shiny face and I had my both cited in to hit four and a half inches high to make it through the gap. That's insane. Yup. Yeah. Spellman right here. Sharon was running the iphone but I had four cameras out so we can get some cool angles and stuff and I wanted to wait till night so that that lighted nock could give a little bit more. Wow factor for everyone watching this. It's such a ridiculous shot, but this is a hundred yards thanks to the audit people to for that was awesome and getting that thing look at that and it was pretty crazy. There you go, Joe. How awesome is that?

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       It's pretty amazing. And you guys watch that on Youtube. It just went off on youtube. On the knock on archery. Yeah. Not. Did you guys put it up to you? We'll put a link up. Okay. Jamie just put you, if you can tweet it and I'll, I'll retweet it when we get a chance. That is insanely hard to do. It's A. I mean, I never did any archery whatsoever until about three years ago. I mean, maybe I might've done it. I think I might've done it in the boy scouts. Yeah. Everyone says that. You know what's funny is every person that finds out one, they're in disbelief that there's actually like professional archers, but then they say, oh, I tried archery like back in school on time and Jim and I loved it and, but then everyone says, but I hit my arm. Right. Remember that they tried it once and they loved it, but they hit their arm.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       That's what they always say. Yeah. That's. I always thought you had to wear those risk. Things. Like when I would see people that were shooting bows without those risks things. I'm like, they're like riding a motorcycle without a helmet. These people are crazy. They're loose people. Well, the way some people shoot it is like riding a bike without a helmet, appeal some skin off. You do it the wrong way. Well, that's what I've been going into over these last couple of days with you and this one more more fascinating aspects about this. I want to. I don't want to call it a sport because I think archery is a lot of different things. It's a discipline for sure, but in when it's done correctly in lot of ways it's almost like a martial art. It's like learning. It's like a weapon. Art, like in martial arts, when you see someone do something, like if someone's like really good at judo or something like that, like when they execute throw and it's just perfect position and perfect technique.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       It's beautiful. You know, this is like a beauty to it. Yeah. And when you see an an archer like I was talking to you about that this when I was watching and trying to get it in my head, this sort of follow that you have in what you do and it's super similar in a lot of ways and something that I really didn't predict. Like I guess I just always assumed that I kind of know what something is. If it seems pretty straightforward, like, oh yeah, you pull the string back and then you let the Arrow fly. Pretty straightforward, like I think that's most people's idea of what archery is, but then when you really pay attention to the technical aspects of all the different stuff that's going on and all the different things you think about and how you literally can not have anything on your mind other than all the technique involved, your foot placement, your technique, and standing, your breathing, where you're drawing it back, the position of your front shoulder, the position of your rear elbow, how you're pulling, where it, how, what do you, how do you respond after the hour was released?

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       There's so much going on that like when you put it all together like it, it has. It leaves no room for homework. There's no room for relationship bullshit. There's no room for taxes. There's no room in there. Man. If you want to make a nice shot like that, like I guarantee you, if we can have a brain scan of your head the second you release that Arrow at a hundred yards to go in that two inch gap, there would be nothing in there other than what you did. It would be no other. No other cells would be fired up. Nope.

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       No. That's one thing. And actually like yesterday when we were shooting

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       there,

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       the end of the day, you got to the point where you almost, your mind was clear. It's almost like for me, you know, your family came home, like things are winding down. You knew that like work was over and we. It was like right before dark and like for me, I love shooting at first light and it lasts light because it seems like that's what I'm not really worried about. Someone texting me or calling me. I'm not worried about problem at home and I shoot with a clear mind and I am way more efficient in my practice and it is a form of meditation. I mean, it's like you said, it's an art and if you're clouded than you, it will reflect that on the target. I mean it's like if your arrows are in one spot, then you know you have a single focus and it's almost like the more those arrows are spread, that's a representation of how many other thoughts and distractions you have going in your mind. I mean, and I look at it that way when I shoot, I'm trying to narrow everything down to just a movement and you look at good golfers, the ones that swing easy and it just literally looks like flow. There's such good strikers and there's so much more efficient when you see people that are trying to be robotic and, and almost like hack something. Then it's like too systematic. You know, you see someone like that does professional karate or something. If they're in a forums competition, if they're like

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       real rigid going around. It's just not what it's meant to be. I mean it's supposed to be a dance. It's supposed to be like literally a mental musical that's plan and if your mind is clear then it's, it's a form of meditation really is no question about it. And that same state of total complete concentration exists in a bunch of different disciplines and I, you know, finding it in archery now rec or I should say recognizing it, I definitely haven't hit it. But finding that, seeing it and recognizing that sort of a super high level flow that comes into play when someone's excellent at what they do. Um, I've seen that in pool. I've seen that watching professional pool players like perfect example of what you were talking about, striking the ball really hard as a golfer. There's a guy named Francisco Bustamante is one of the best pool players in the world and he's from the Philippines and Francisco Bustamante has the most ridiculous break you would think if you watch his break shot, that he weighs 400 pounds and has arms like tree trunks.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       You watch that break just blah, blah, blah. It all just the triangle. If you watch them, just watch the speed of the ball and it's effortless. The way he does it, he's just, he has this perfect amount of timing and flow here. You could see him do it here. This isn't him. This is a different guy. It just look up a Bustamante Francisco Bustamante breaking. That's what it says that there. Well, there's definitely not him. This is a some overweight gentlemen. What if it gained. Oh, that is him. That is. He was just. It's a weird. He's in a weird pose. Oh, that's what it is. It's just a weird pose. I thought when he was bent over, I thought that was his whole body. Yeah, it's loading, but he's a tiny guy. Like if you see him physically. Yeah. I mean he. It might weigh like, well he's a little fat now he's getting older, but when he was young he probably weighed like 140 pounds, but he was like, oh my goodness.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       Those balls, they go flying everywhere. No one's like him. Jihad dog. He's excited. I think he just one on the break or something like that. I've seen him make six balls on the brake, like he's playing nine ball. He make six balls in the break. He's got three balls to run out. It's just insanely good, but he's just a devastating player all around. And one of the things when you watch him play and a lot of the Filipinos, Filipinos are so good. There's so many really good Filipino pool players, but they have this gentle flow to what they're doing. Like everything is like a ballet, like effortless. Deloitte of the q does like all the work and everything looks like it looks like so flowing. Like a dance, like a dance. Well, the one thing that's so cool about, well the one thing I'm really proud of is an archer, is that I've got to the point where I have a platform to get people involved. And that was

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       when I found out that you really liked my podcasts, which the podcasts are totally geared around education and learning. You know, that's what that I got to a platform to where I could help people. And now there's people like you that are coming in that never really have considered that whole world. And they come in and I look at people that like, you know, they go to the YMC A, they want to take like touchy or they want to take yoga. They're looking for a stress free type of hobby. And archery is a great sport for that. It's growing so much. I mean Hollywood's embracing it obviously with a lot of the movies, but they're, they're not portraying it as an art form. When that movie the hell's it called, where's the girl who go hungry again

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       when she started becoming more famous or that movie rather became popular. Archery took off.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       Oh yeah. A lot of people got involved. Yeah. I mean, you look at, um, you look at the avengers, you look at hunger games, there's, there's actually so many, even a lot of the sitcoms now p, you know, obviously crossbows are popular because of the walking dead, but when it comes to like true archery, you just see a lot more archers coming in. Lord of the rings, you know, legless was so popular because of, because of that. And it's really such a cool sport. I mean, it's an Olympic sport and we've. We've actually have a phenomenal Olympic team here in the US. Our men's team is definitely going to be contenders for another metal. They were silver medalist last year and so you were saying that compound bows are not in the Olympics and the recurve bows, it's recurve bows and that's kind of a tradition and honestly it's a different style of art, but it's super graceful to.

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       And I mean I think it's everyone has something that they like to do. Some people like the simplicity of a sport. It's like there's people that go and want to only have a long bow or they don't want sites. They just want the zen part of trying to pull back with with no sites, but then there's also people like us that want to see how finite and accurate you can become. So they liked the techie side, which is where compound bows come in and they're just. They're much more efficient and obviously the accuracy as we seen is, is almost mindblowing mindblowing

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       guy like me because I'm a gadget dork. So it combines both things. It combines the zen aspect of complete and total discipline and focus and looking at one task and be drowning out the rest of the world, but it also has like geeky stuff, like different kinds of sites and this is a new cam that they just came out with and these are different kinds of strings and when you do this, that makes this better and this is so much going on with it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       Oh yeah. You can, you know, if I look back at the bose I started with and I've, I've only been shooting since 97, so 19 years I guess it seemed. I'm getting old now, but um, that's a long time. The bose that I use then that are at the house. You wonder how in the heck he shot that good with. Um, and actually, um, two months ago I was at the Olympic headquarters, like the Olympic Museum. So they have all these awesome Olympic artifacts of like swim trunks, people oil or like, you know, the javelin. I got to see the original recurve bow, like Jay bars was actually on display and they constantly change them. So if you're visiting the museum, you're not seeing the same things all the time, but you look at those pieces of equipment, the bikes, the bikes that people wrote in the Olympic Games, it's like, holy cow, how are they that efficient?

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       It's almost more impressive because now we've gotten so advanced in our equipment that it's easier to be at the level, I think than 20 years ago because the equipment just wasn't there. You know, I almost wonder if those people didn't have to put in two or three times the time and be just that much more elegant at what they did because their equipment was almost a handicap back then. Could they perform the same kind of feats? Like could someone shoot an Arrow like that? Like was it a common thing to be able to shoot what you did 100 yards and shooting through that two inch opening into the Kettlebell handle? Um, I'm sure there are people that were, there's a lot, there's actually a lot of people in archery now that are pushing this envelope. I mean, long distance shooting is becoming super popular and you know, to a lot of the real target archers that are out there that are listening to this podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       See, when we go to a full feed of tournament, we shoot 30 feet, fetus stand for um, well now it's world archery. So a world archery event. If you shot a, a full target round, you would shoot arrows at 30 or 30 meters, 50 meters, 70 meters and 90 meters. So I found out from you that 90 meters is 99 yards. It's one of the easiest metric conversions that do. You take the first number and you add it to the second. So if you've got 40, take the floor and added behind the 40, you got 44 yards. If it's 40 meters. So yeah, that's one of the one metric system that I never forget, but I'm so 99 yards is where we would stand on the line and shoot at, you know, and I, I think I told you that back in 2005, I was really focused on shooting well for the u s team when I was on the compound team and there were several tournaments that I was really focused on.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       I knew that I was going to be shooting. I'm a national championship and in Britain and in Australia, I was going to be going. I think I shot one in Poland, um, had won one or two here in the. But you know, in that year I think I logged. I mean I shot two, three, $400 a day and 90 meters for me, the further you go out, it's like putting a bigger microscope on things that you're doing wrong. You know, it's, it's just like an art or um, if you look at a golfer that's making long putts, obviously it's magnifying mistakes and they're swinging or golfers that are drivers, you know, people that really are just sitting there trying to be accurate at the long game. It magnifies mistakes. So I really like shooting at longer distances. I know you do too because it magnifies a mistake and you can correct it easier and it really helps bring things together.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       But that year I shot well over 30,000 arrows at 99 yards during steering training things. Yeah. I mean, and there's professional archers, there's archery, there's archers right now somewhere that's preparing for a world cup event or something. And there's people that literally have calluses thicker and most weightlifters just from grabbing a hold of that release or you know, I remember looking at an Olympic recurve shooters fingers one time, um, and I remember his, his hands, his three fingers that he grabs a string with. It looked like a frog hand because the tips were so big from pulling blood because he, and I mean these guys, you look at the people that are like the Olympic training centers that are just there, they get up, they go eat and then they shoot until five or six at night and they eat and then they go and do a weight training session.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       I bet you there's people that do a thousand errors a day. So you know, you can build up some stamina. Yeah, it's really impressive. Um, but in saying that, I think with archery it's, you know, you know that I'm really big into fitness as well. I credit my fitness and my story is an athlete prior to being an archer as part of what's helped me be successful and there's a big difference between quantity and quality and a lot of people make the mistake I think with any sport of just trying to practice more or train more. And even weightlifters, you know, I see people that I go in the gym and they're like on one exercise and then when I leave the gym in 50 minutes or an hour were like maybe done two different types of exercise and it's just, it's not efficient, you know, I think a lot of people as athletes sometimes miss the boat of quality over over the quantity in.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       And I was always that way. There's days where I go practice and I may only make 100 shots, but once I started realizing that I'm breaking down, I know to step away. You don't try to push through it. Yeah. And I told you that yesterday too. There was a time where I said, you know, if, if we're just out here getting repetition, I guess that's one thing, but we really don't need to do that. Aiming at a target. We had a really good point too about those bad shots and bad repetitions. You gotta you gotta get those out of your head. So it's not just that you made a bad shot. Now you have to make a bunch of good shots to try to get away with you from the effect of the bad shot. It's not as simple as the one bad shot. No, it's imprinting.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       I mean it's, it's an imprint and I think with any type of athletic, you know, and it's probably that way with fighters. I'm sure too if you get someone that's just really in a rhythm and a flow, if also when they start making a mistake or doing something bad as a coach, he try to get them back into that rhythm again so that you can weed out that imprint. You know, and that's tough as an athlete sometimes you know, people that, and I'm sure for fighters, you know, you look at people that come out and have a disappointing loss. It's almost like that's an imprint. It is. And that's why that statement and you're only as good as your last fight. It was so disturbing to fighters. Yeah. And and that's one thing, one of the most important things that I learned as a competitive archer and I was, I had a temper when I first started as a pro, if I made a bad shot, you know, Kinda like when you kind of put one in the pool when you put one of the pool and you were like, frigate, you are pissed off.

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       I, that's how I would be on a, on a, on a tournament, you know, I would freak and ran my stabilizer under the ground so hard that I would crack it in my mind problem was. And that just did it once I did a, this is really complicated, Geeky sort of an explanation folks, but there's a certain type of release where it's attention based release and as we're practicing with and difference between pulling a trigger and then allowing the tension, but you have to hold the safety while you pull it back. Otherwise the Arrow just, it just fly. It means it's not like, it's not like it's going to shoot anything. It's going really slow, but it logs in a very embarrassing and just very disappointing when this book comes off your thing, as you're pulling the bow back, it goes blank and you go, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       I did this. I did it three times, did it yesterday and today. Super. It's super embarrassing. But uh, so that's, uh, yeah, I was definitely annoyed myself. Well, when I would make something like that, that would really trigger me into a pissed off realm, I would let one mistake affect everything else after that. And a lot of athletes, they're really good athletes that I watch and any sport tennis players, golfers, the key is when you have a negative moment to not let it affect what hasn't happened yet. So I'm a guy came up to me one time after I made a bad shot and he could tell I was getting hot and he looked at me and he said, you know, the only arrows you have control on right now are the ones that are still in that quiver. And for me that, like, it completely changed my outcome as a professional archer.

Speaker 2:          00:24:11       And I've, I've brought so much of what archery has done to me as an athlete into my life and there's times were you just something really torques you off and you have to just like look at, okay, everything I do from here on out is the only thing I have control on because that's history. There's no, I haven't figured out a way. Once that released, glows playing to actually grab that Arrow and pull it back and stick it back in the quiver or put it back on the string. It's like a perfect representation of life. You make a decision. If it was shit, you have to reset and say, what do I need to do with myself to get back on track in life? We make bad decisions at times, but how do we make a good decision to get back on, get back online?

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       Yeah. It's, it's management of the mind in a lot of ways. Yup. And it's one of the things that I also like about our true love about archery is that it's absolute like you, you can't pull that Arrow back like it's flying through the air. And either it hits the Bullseye or you missed. It's just it is what it is. It doesn't care about where you live. It doesn't care who your uncle is, it doesn't care how much money you make you here, it doesn't care like the the arrows going to go. It's an absolute discipline and I think you coming from professionals or coming from sports or other sports background, we played a lot of football when you play sports, but especially insanely competitive sports, you learn where all the edges are to be had. You learn with all the edges are to be had as far as technique, as far as conditioning, so it all the different things you have to do in order to be successful and to win.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       And everyone knows that in most sports, especially in the physical sport like football, there's a fucking lot of work involved. There's not a single person who jumps off the bench who doesn't have any training whatsoever and kicks ass and football. You just don't. You gotta learn and you have to learn how to move. You have to learn all the different plays. You have to learn. Technique involved in different aspects of the sport and I think coming from a competitive background in athletics, you've kind of translated that understanding of where all the problems are in archery because there's a lot of people that are like, they don't have good coaching and so they start off with a lot of really bad habits and then they have to figure out a way to either break those habits or they live with those habits and then they do the best they with this sort of limited path that they've carved in and they seem to not be able to escape.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       The same thing exists in martial arts. One of the hardest things for me when I used to teach was teaching people that already had a bad technique imprinted in their brain. Like they would have one way of throwing a kick or something like that and that would have to go, oh Jesus. I got to figure out a way to break this guy. Have this thing. Because as soon as he gets tired or as soon as he panics, the Nigos down, the foot goes up. It loses all the power of the hips, don't engage. It's like, but if I could take a kid like a five year old kid and show them that from the beginning, their instinct would be to throw it correctly. The instinct, even when tired knee comes up, hip turns over, body extends full power and those things are so hard to unlearn once you get like a bad path. That's why it's. I really do think that archery and a lot of ways is a martial art.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       Yeah. Oh yeah. Well you look at the whole Asian culture and I've said time and time again, I've coached all over the world and you know, that's Kinda what I do now. I do a lot of coaching that most people don't even know about with teams that just would rather have confidentiality and whether or not they're working with an outside source, which is great. But when I, the probably the best place I ever taught was when I went to India because I actually taught those a Ha. I was supposed to have 16 archers. Once I got there, there was about 140. I mean, it was unbelievable the anyone they thought could be a potential winner for their team was there and there was so many kids and you know, adults that were there and I remember I took several members of the team that had a bad habit of punching the trigger and anticipating the shot, which is a big negative in our tree and I gave them a device.

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       Same one I gave you. I gave him a release that forces them to not think about actually aiming the front side of the boat. It's a device that makes them focus on the movement of archery, pulling through the bowl, letting the front arm go for the back arm to come back. And I remember I gave him string and that release. I took all their bones away and locked him up. [inaudible]. I said, until you can do this, we're not going any further. So I took those eight and I had them do that to the side and then I came over and I started trying to work on all these other people and there was like this person needed their boat, worked on this person needed to watch me shoot this, people want to, you know, to take pictures or video of me shooting. Then we went to lunch.

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       Then the whole thing started over again. Then when it came to dinnertime, I told them, you guys all go ahead. I'm going to like, pack up my gear. Well, once the whole big crowd left, those same eight kids were still over there with strings pulling on that release and almost every one of them were damn near bloody in their hand from just executing. And I came over. I'm like, oh my goodness. Have you guys been here the whole day? Yes sir. Yes sir. There is like, there's there that culture. There's just no wonder to me why. Like martial arts is such a discipline because that culture teaches discipline and hard work within that art better than anything. And I think that archery coming out of, you know, out of Asia, I think all the like the Korean team are so strong because of their disciplines and I'm sure with the martial arts it's exact same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       They're not afraid to take what the coach says and just do it until the coach Says No. And a lot of people here in any sport are looking for the shortcut. People at the gym, they want the show. Yeah, they want to shake that melts fat. They want to be able to go in and get the machine that does four minute abs or whatever. And the reality is you have to have commitment and you have to have discipline in anything in life. Otherwise if you don't, you're just going to be another person bitching about while someone else has something you don't because you're not willing to put the effort in for it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       Yeah. And then on the other hand, it's not a good idea to cut your hands with the. You take some time off. Kids get slow, slow down. Don't be afraid to raise your hand and say, coach, can we take a break here? And then I pointed out to a lot of people that, um, you know, there's a lot of people that don't want to get involved in anything like archery that I'm interested in it because they feel like, uh, they don't want to hunt, they don't want to be a bow hunter. I've, I've heard that before. I'm not interested in that. And I'm like, if even if you don't have to be interested in that, like that is the furthest end of the extreme spectrum when it comes to archery. You could enjoy archery with just a yard, a yard and a target. I mean, you can, you don't need to shoot anything other than a target to, to get like, you know, yesterday and today we're just shooting targets and very fun, super fulfilling. Like at the end of the day, you know, especially because yesterday made a lot of progress. At the end of the day I was like, wow, you know, this feels great. Cleansing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       You've made a dramatic improvement. I mean, I'm, I'm really pumped with how you are, but what I love about archery is hopefully you can't hear that they can. This is Dang good by the way. When, when? When Joe does his commercials, which actually it's the only thing on TV. I don't fast forward through the commercials because I love how you do them, but when he talks about the butter coffee, take his advice on it. It's good. I've enjoyed it. Yeah. Get some good coffee, good grass fed butter and mct oil. It was lined it all up. It was. Yeah, it was awesome. I think what's so cool about archery too is it's not a sport that is limited by your age and for that matter, it's not totally limited by your physical physique. Well, how about that guy that has no arms? Oh yeah. Matt, is that believable and credible?

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       Yeah. Matt Stutzman is. I mean he should be Matt studs. Minis. I mean the armless archer, he's so inspiring. I mean is kind of. His nickname is it's inspirational archer and he's definitely just that for someone to be able to shoot with their legs is amazing. And Actually Matt, we haven't talked about this, but matt and another pair archer here from the u s named Jeff February that she eats with his mouth. He was in a motorcycle accident and now he's a pair of archer. Yeah, there's Matt Stutzman right there. So how does Matt. He holds the ball with his right foot and then his left foot's on the ground. And how does he release the bow? So. Well, he's, he's actually um, design jeff favor is next I think two on to the right. But so he's developed a release to where he's actually able to push on it with his chin and he's a, he actually activates from back tension.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       Now they've designed a release for where he can hook on and he slowly starts to continue to move back until it triggers the string to fire them as he moves back. Who's still looking through his peep site? Yep. Yeah, it's a small movement. You know how small the movement is. I mean, when I talk about that movement, it's very finite. It's a matter of an inch or two that I think that's jeff right there. Yeah, there's Jeff Avery. So yeah, when I did, um, last year when I had to have my shoulder, my shoulder redone, I did not want to miss archery season and just really took it as a personal challenge to not put my head down and I learned to shoot. It was actually my bow arm was the one I had worked on, so I had to learn to shoot with my mouth using my opposite arm in my, in my non dominant eye, which was, I'm thankful for it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       People always, you know, people ask me all the time if I regret this or if I would do that different and screw that. I mean, you can't. The past is the past. I just want to look forward on everything. When I, when I messed up my shoulder, I was bummed about it, but in all fairness, I thought it was a really good challenge to look at a sport that I love from a new direction, to look at the technique involved. Yep. You know, I think, um, someone said it, I forget who it was that one of the best ways to get good at something is to do it with your opposite hand

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       and that not just doing it, like say if like you, you're boxing and you're working on your, uh, your, your straight right hand. A lot of times when you do your straight lefthand and actually improves your straight right hand because in learning how to do it in an awkward way, what you're doing is sort of programming into your mind the critical aspects of the technique. How to throw the hips in window to plant. And then when you go over to your more coordinated side, it's just like super tuned in to the critical aspects of the movement. So then when you throw a left hand, then he switched over to your right side. You're like, damn, it's just, it's even better. It's even faster. It's even cleaner and I think that that probably makes sense to the archery as well. I've been a lot of people would probably benefit, although it's not a traditional thing to do. Probably benefit from having both a lefthanded bow and a right hand and ball learning how to shoot lefthanded

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       well, look at how many skateboarders get better when they learn to skate goofy, you know, if they learn to skate with the opposite foot back back when I was a skater, you know, either skated like straight footer. He skated Goofy, but then people didn't really switch back and forth a lot at that time and less like the freestyle skaters did back then. But then when I got away from skating and started playing football for awhile and then archery and then all of a sudden you know, the x games happen and you start seeing guys like Tony Hawk or whatever. You realize that the whole skating world just completely went to like with the freestyle skaters were and just being able to switch either way and still perform the exact same tricks. And I think any athlete that's listening, and you know what's funny is sometimes I've seen you say, you know, hey, I'm talking about hunting today, but some of your listeners might get pissed, but whatever, because some people just want UFC or some people don't like to hear the kid.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       Never worry about that. Yeah. But what's super important is that people need to take some of these elements and apply them to their life. And what I really believe is when I get better as an athlete is when I recognize whatever my biggest weakness is, and that's what I focus on making my strength. I call it selective cycling. I work on this with a lot of my students. I'll literally take the one thing that they do the worst and that's all I want them to do for almost a month because a lot of psychology has shown that if you have a negative habit, it normally takes about 21 days to recreate a positive habit, right? So you have to be able to take your weakness and mentally be tough enough as an athlete to be willing to make that your strength. And I've had several things in my career that were my weakness that are now my strongest aspect.

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       Field archery was my biggest weakness. Now, my biggest strength is the difference between feel archery. Well, it's not on flat ground, you know, once you start changing angles and once you start having to make shots and canyons you have to learn. When do you have to learn trajectory. So field archery is, you have like a course that you have to run and it's all outdoors in the woods. Yup. It would be outdoors. It would be, you know, the really difficult field courses are like throughout like cliffs and mountainous areas to where, you know, you have shots where they're straight up way over your shoulder where you're aiming non, you know, 50 degree angles and then you're aiming down or somewhere. I've even had to aim straight down between my legs. Um, those types of things are extremely technical. You know, if you had golfers that had to play in really difficult terrain, obviously they have to start learning draws and fades and they have to start learning clubs that play differently in the wind.

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       It would, it would be the same thing it pointed out, just like when we shoot at longer distances, like I mean you were, you were shooting amazing at eight period, 80 yards on your rubber, dear you rubber l key call it, he's laughing the rubber. It's, but um, you are shooting amazing and then you would have one shot where something wasn't right, but it would show up. And that's what field archery did to me. It really started to open up my weaknesses. And for me as an athlete, I'm always so competitive that I want to know what I suck at because I think if you're really going to master something, regardless of the craft, you have to be so well rounded. And I mean the UFC is that way. Even as a spectator. I'm not a, I'm not like a fight specialist by any means, but I, I've always loved watching the UFC and it's funny how the people who won the early ufc vs how rounded you have to be now to when you can't afford to have a weakness.

Speaker 2:          00:40:36       So ignoring it isn't doing you any favors. Yeah, it's a different world now, completely different world and he also, much like we were talking about before in the UFC, you have to be able to pretty much execute from both sides. It's very rare that someone only has like a good right kick, you know, you have to learn how to kick with the left side too. But in Jujitsu that, that exists as well. Like there's a lot of guys that have a strong side, like the only, like the past to the left or they don't want it to pass through the ride. They only submit guys off the right arm. It's like it's real common to have a side where you're really good at it. What really, uh, one thing you said that the other day when we were sitting there talking and you were talking about setting up moves for Jujitsu and how evolving it is, how it continually evolves and all of a sudden a new move we'll get invented and you'll be practicing that. And then someone just notices like, wait, there's a big weakness right there, do this. And we've kind of eliminated someone getting

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       that moved done on you and then it's like, holy crap. Well, so how do we, how do we actually combat that? Right. It's just a continual chess game. Yeah. It really is. And the body can move and so many different ways. It's one of the more interesting aspects of Jujitsu's. There's so many different ways the body can move. So when two people are engaged in each other, where there's the possibilities of attacks and counterattacks are near infinite. It's a, it's, it's a spectacular example of like an extreme discipline and was something that becomes just for a lot of people, becomes a massive, massive obsession. You see the Anthony Bourdain thing that he wanted to do through tournament. Anthony Bourdain starts Jujitsu at 58 years old. Okay. He, uh, was, I think he had quit smoking, wasn't smoking anymore because he stopped smoking when his daughter was born, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       But still, it still was hitting the booze, you know, still wasn't eating healthy. He was on statens for his blood pressure or cholesterol, I guess he just, you know, just wasn't healthy. Yeah. Gets into Jujitsu because of his wife. His wife is a maniac. She loves Jujitsu, gets into it, and now he's obsessed. Trains every day, often twice a day. And he just wanted you to, to tournament as a blue belt at. What is it? Fifty nine or something like that. Fucking incredible. Fifty nine year old Anthony Bourdain took home the goal that is first Jujitsu tournament. I mean, get the fuck Outta here. That's awesome. As someone who loves Jujitsu, I'm just blown away. I'm blown away. I just love seeing a guy like him who is a madman man. So many different things. And also a guy who was an artist and he, his art being culinary, being a chef.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       I learned from watching his show that that's an art form. I didn't really consider it before I watched. Um, no reservations is old show. I watched him interact with all these cooks and the like, a light bulb went off. I'm like, oh, cooking is art. I never thought of it that way. I thought it was like, oh, that guy now has a cook. This guy makes some good this and that guy cooked some good that, but I didn't think of it in the same way. I look at like a maybe a guy who was an amazing sculptor. I didn't think about it that way and then I realized that when I watched a show it was like, yeah, really? I never did. I was just thought, oh, this guy's a good kick, you know, this guy knows how to make sausages or this guy's really good at Lasagna or something, you know, it didn't, didn't, didn't seem like an art.

Speaker 1:          00:44:05       So seeing him, a guy who highlighted that there is an art and cooking food. Then become obsessed with this art of Jujitsu, which I think in a lot of ways, like we were saying about archery archery, there's parallels. I mean, people think of Kendo, which is a Japanese sword fighting art that's unquestionably a martial art, but then so is our strike archery and we have. Kendall is a martial art, so his archery 100 percent because archery involves a weapon involved, but it's so much more than that man. So much more than that. At some weird, crazy moving meditation that I feel like when it goes well, like yesterday when we shot really well and we shot like tight groups at 80 yards. Well after it's over. Like physically, you feel better. You feel like charged up, you feel elevated, you feel better than if you did nothing. Like there's like if you could take a drug that makes you feel the way you feel when you hit a perfect acts at 80 yards like that, like you'd take that drug all day. Oh yeah. That was a cigarette. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       and high on both side. I've been pounded, pounded that crap all lit up right now. My Skin's Tingley. Yeah. It's very strange. I guess discipline, a martial art discipline, but I think almost labeling these things in any other way than just calling them what they mean. That is just. It is archery. You know when you put them in categories, when you categorize things as this is a sport or this is a hobby or this is a. It almost trivializes the benefits, the positive benefits of it. It's funny that you say that because now I know I could never pull you away because I love as an athlete to step away with perfection and you would shoot a group that was like perfect and I knew that we were close to being done for the day and I'd be like, all right, let's end on that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:08       And you're like, no way dude, I'm doing another one. But then. But then if you make one negative shot in that group, you were pissed again. Which I can understand too because I'm so competitive that way. But I also love that feeling that you're talking about. It's awesome sometimes to have that and it's important and that's what I was trying to like work with you on is it doesn't get better than what you just did. You're on a high. Let's, I want you to like step away thinking about your trip all night. So tomorrow, you know, you visualize it long enough. I'm the way I think is tomorrow you're more likely to be able to duplicate. I don't like to go. I don't ever like to go to bed on a negative. Right. So that's actually what I was trying to do, but you know, we're not good enough friends where I can be like, listen, give me your. Well, I don't know. I guess I did take some stuff away from probably some of the releases that I was using. He won't let me use in house. Well, this is very geeky stuff. So for people that are listening to this, they didn't understand, but because there's so many different aspects of archery, there's where you're standing, what your posture is, how you're, how you're focusing, what you're looking

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       at, what are your concentrating on. Because of that, there is. There's a tendency to anticipate the shot and it becomes sort of overwhelming because you're managing all these different things. So what a lot of people try to concentrate now in the world of archery is getting what you call it, a surprise shot. Meaning that this is just for the people at home, obviously not for you, meaning that when you pull back, the thing that you concentrating on is just focusing on the target. All of your technique as far as keeping the bulb balanced and level and keeping it onto all that stuff is something you've already worked on. All you're working on now is pulling through the shot so you don't think about executing the shot like ready go, and when you think of that ready go that pressing that button, you have a tendency or possibility of punching it, of hitting it wrong, of tweaking and twisting, and we talked about that today because it's in a lot of ways, it's like a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       You know that when a fighter trains for a fight, you're training for something that is going to be a moment that's like months away from now. So all of this work and effort then comes to fruition in this one moment. Fighter number one, are you ready? Fire number two. Oh, you're ready. Fight. Holy Shit. Here it is. It's happening, but at least in a fight you're, you know, you've got a few rounds. You can kind of settle in after the first minute or so. You can relax and get into the groove of everything in archery. Oftentimes that all that training and preparation, whether it's for a tournament or even more critically, if you're hunting, it comes down to that one moment in that moment sometimes can be completely overwhelming because that moment, although your practice has been constant and diligent, that moment is entirely alien.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       This moment didn't exist during any of the practice. There was never the elevated heart rate. There's never the freakout. There's never the massive consequences if you make an error, everything has to be in place, and those, those things are what make a discipline so rewarding. When you actually pull it off. All of those things like knowing that there's so many different factors involved and then this alien moment, so those factors involve all the discipline factors. You have to drill them into a point where they become a part of you. They become like ingrained in your genetics. They become a part of your DNA so that in that one insane heart pounding moment, you can execute it flawlessly and the best way to do it, which I'm learning from you, is by figuring out how to do it with a surprise shot. So that way you take out that the anticipation aspect of it. Yeah, it's less you think about it, the more likely it is for things to happen, you know you have to be so focused on the process that the prize happens without your expectation.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       The really interesting part about what I've learned as a competitive archer is it's the fastest buzz kill of any sport I've ever had, and what I mean by that is there's times where you're standing on the line, you realize, okay, archer number one, one Arrow, archer, number two, one Arrow closest to center decides the gold medal match. You literally let go and you're, you know, you're sitting there, you know shit and pickles. Your heart rate's beaten out, your neck. You know you're trying not to. I actually had this, I've had this feeling go both ways, but you let that Arrow go and you, you have so much adrenaline that you can barely manage it and then you're, you shoot and you see the shadow of that Arrow hit out like out of the gold to where you know you lost and it's instantly gone. You have, you're not nervous, you're sweating or shaking.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       You just knew you blew it and it's like wiped so fast. It's really, really strange that the release of one product of an art form can just, you instantly know that you screwed up and you know, and I've been that way as a hunter too, where you get nervous and all of a sudden that shot happens and then you almost can't. You know, for some people they make the shot and then they get like that. But sometimes you make that shot and it's amazing how fast it's just gone and it's such a rewarding thing when you can take that ball of just emotion and just say, I got this and you fricking clamped down on it and then you see that Arrow going to the gold and it's just like, it's such a reward. Like for me, that's what I think for you and your mentality, me and mine, you get so much reward for that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       That for me, I never really worried about it. I never worried about a trophy or metal or for that matter than checks never really mattered either when I was younger I needed them. But you know, I've just came to the realization that, you know, every trophy I have at home is tarnished. You know, they need cleaning, you know, they just wilt away. But what imprints I have in my mind of moments like that's what pulls me through as a person and it's positive or that I can reflect on, you know, I know that what's satisfying to me and I feel so content with life is these small little goals and accomplishments that I've had where I've controlled myself, not the situation. I was in a gold medal match in Poland and they had the, the gold medal match in this square, like in the square of the main town.

Speaker 2:          00:53:41       You're shooting from the, from the beach into the main square of the town. And our match was first and I was the first archer. So I stepped up. We were in a team round and there was so many people. I raised my bow, I pulled back, I was going into my shot. And as I'm looking through my scope at the target, about four people's heads come, like looking in like this because there are people lined all the way down and this is 70 meters. So everyone's evidently was shuffling to try to get to see the archer. Not Realizing in like, okay, there's an arrow going over your head. So I'm going from like mentally having a sight picture that I'm not nervous about to all of a sudden thinking if I shoot someone in the face, I don't want to spend the rest of my life.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       And uh, Poland, Polish prison and I remember like someone like keep cleaning the line, getting the people to back. No, it was just like they did. I don't think they really thought that people were going to come in. And I remember I drew back and I was so, I mean you've seen me shoot in my element. It's very smooth. So then all of a sudden there was like, my front arm was like, you know, I got into that tremor mode. Like, you know what you have when you, when the anxiety sets in. And I remember I shot and they're like, you know, they called 10 and I came off the line and my other teammate that was with me, he goes, what the hell, dude? Why are you shaking so bad? If he's like, what the hell, dude, you almost miss what's up with you, like as we're passing one another and I go, you'll see a fricken pulls back and he goes, what the f?

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       So that next round my gift, freaking people out of the way, like I had people's faces in my scope. That's a youtube video waiting to happen. Somebody catching one of the temple leaning into the path. That's just so ridiculous. Don't want one to 10 if anybody doesn't it, if you don't know, like when you're looking through a site of a, um, uh, on archer and oboe, archery sites have very small. So you're looking at a very narrow window. So for these people to actually be in your site, they had to be extremely close to the path of the era. It's a one. Well, the Arrow was arguing over there melon, but because they were between me and the target. So crazy though. It was very crazy. Um, yeah. I was like, what is this? Did what I did at the pool today? Throwing safety of that. Yeah, it's easy when you're concentrating all the other things you. It weirds me out. I've been at. I've been at places where I'm practicing and you're like shooting and someone else's at this club and you like go down to pull your Arrow and then all of a sudden you're like sitting there like pulling the arrows and it's like. And you're like, Yo, what's up? Oh God. Oh, I'm just saying. I mean even at that other targets like, okay, well yeah, you know, how many Joe Rogan pool shots I've seen

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       I might want to be on the receiving end of that certainly can happen. You know, what you've got set up is, is really cool. That giant long range at your house. So you could practice like in your yard like that. Like there's a video that you put up. John set up my bow. I got this bowl from hoyt. John set it up perfect. And he took these crazy shots and one of them we took was 122 yards. And um, to, to be able to do that and to have like this big open space like that. In your yard, it's got to be fucking awesome. It's weak.

Speaker 2:          00:57:12       Cool. Yeah. Actually, um, when we bought my house, my wife Sharon, she knew that we wanted to move out to a farm because we're. When I. Before I moved to Iowa

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       so that could get more deer tags. You laugh about that. That's hilarious. Fuck moves to a state so they can get more deer tags. You can get an extra dear. Doesn't guarantee you right now. Campaigns could get to elk tags. If he crossed the state line, I'll guarantee it. He would do it. He loves Oregon. He travels a lot. Anyway. He might see I get three buck tags. Actually three different situation though, like a white tail hunting and I was just so different. And plus it's, is for folks who aren't aware if it's like a tradition, it's a, it's an American thing, like a white tail. Hunting is probably the biggest hunting pastime in America. More people hunt white tails. More people spend more time hunting, white tails than anything. And it's also like probably some of the best meat you're ever going to eat in your life. Oh yeah. I've been crushing mind. I'm making. Yeah, I love. That's why I was so surprised when you said you don't, you didn't see like cooking as an art. I actually went, when I go someplace nice, I'm,

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       I take pictures of my food because to me I see it that way. And actually I cook some backstraps the other night and you know, I cook some backstrap so like, you know, Cook some vegetables and like a coconut oil or something and then, you know, I like slice through that tenderloin and like kind of folded them all down and then like stacked my little half strap up and Kinda lean them against there. And I was just like looking at it like why would people not want to do this? Like why would people not want to be able to do this for themselves to make a nice meal and make a nice meal. And obviously it's something that

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       is a reward of hard work, work

Speaker 2:          00:59:15       and dedication that I've put in through the year. You know, my saying, one saying that I made on my TV during the first few seasons is I'm, I'm in target archery to become a better hunter and I'm a better hunter because I'm a target archer. I got into professional archery 100 percent because I wanted to be more proficient and ethical knowing that I was a bow hunter and I kind of had the. I was actually the same type of feeling. I was, I was only 10 but it or I mean when I started competing I started hunting when I was 10, so there was like six or seven years there where I wasn't competing. But I remember having one hunt where I felt so much anxiety and I like blue is shot and I just completely missed and I couldn't explain why. And it was at that moment that I'm like, you know what, if I'm going to do this, I need to be able to be ethical at it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       So at that point I was kind of looking for a way to become better. And I was actually, it was right before I was supposed to leave for my first football camps or college, I was driving down a road and there was a sign on the road that said, um, three d archery shoots and it was just an Arrow pointing down and I pulled in, I had like my hunting bow in the back of my truck, you know, kind of drive in and I see all these people like shooting on this practice range. And then I see like groups of four going into this course to like shoot and it was all foam animal targets with scoring rings on them. And you step up to the line, you look at the target, you try to figure out how far it is without having a range finder.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       And then you make a shot. And depending on, you know, all the scoring is within the ethical kill zone of the animal. So after I think, I think it was 15 targets, it was a 40 target course after 15 targets. I didn't have a single Arrow left in my quiver. I had lost all of them and it was like a wake up call. It was the first time that I had ever felt defeated at something. It was the first time that I had a very clear wakeup call of maybe you're not good enough to be doing this, you know, and for me that was a trigger as a competitor. I think the standout athletes in any sport are the ones that take those moments very personal and change the direction to make it their best or either realized I'm either going to be good at this or I need to find something else to be good at, you know, to focus all your energy to.

Speaker 2:          01:02:07       And one thing led to another. I went to an archery shop were I saw a lot of guys with shirts on that said like the name of a shop. So I knew they were like kind of local shooters representing this store. So the next day I was in that store and I said, hey, I want to get better. I know a lot of guys here, we're shooting and a lot of those guys were in the range and I just started asking questions. A lot of people didn't want to help, which is why I really want to help the archery world. It's my way of giving back because there were people that didn't want to help me, but then I remember the guy came in and said, are my arrows done? And the guy behind the counter said, let me check in the back, and he kind of walked past me and he goes, come here kid.

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       And uh, because I had hung out in that store for about four days, just kind of watching and looking around. I didn't really have any importance. So he takes me in the back room and he says, you got to build these guys arrows for me because I forgot to do them. And I said, I don't know how to build arrows. And he goes, okay, you take this feather, you put it in this clamp, put glue right down this feather, like this. Put the Arrow in this Jig. You push down on it. Then you turn the wheel, go to the next Arrow after you get to the end, take the clamp off, put another feather in, you know, and he literally gave me the thing. So I was in there like trying to figure out how to do this. Even work there. No, I was there like, like literally stalking people in the range.

Speaker 2:          01:03:35       I was like the weird guy in the corner with like the hunting bow that was probably my dad's hand me down. I'm like stocking all the shooters and about an hour later I came out with, you know, this guy's arrows that he probably paid 100 bucks for and some like snot nosed kid that had never even built them, built them for the guy. And so he goes, all right, good job. And he goes here, now go do these. And two weeks later I remember telling my dad, Hey, I think I'm gonna. Um, I'm not going to do that. The football thing. And he's like, what do you mean? I said, I got offered a job at this archery shop. I'm going to do it. And my dad's like, so you're not going to play college football and get a get a, um, an education, you're going to work at an archery shop. And he goes, what's this archery shop pay? And I said, for 10 an hour.

Speaker 2:          01:04:28       Yeah, that was my dad's been so good. My both my parents have been so supportive on everything in life. But that was the one time where he looked me in the face and just said, this is a really stupid decision. But Hey, I mean, you know, it's, I just think it's a great story because it shows that if someone's willing to commit to a dream, then as long as you're able to put in the work and stay focused on it, there's so many people that make businesses out of dreams are, you know, careers out of sports that you would never even consider. We'll just think of that story. Now you're traveling all over the world coaching international teams and archery. I mean, it's a crazy story. It really stop. Think about it. It's really weird. You know, I have some very. I have some friends that are very successful according to the business world and there's times where I'm with those people and then they're introducing me to like a senator or governor, and then they're like, well, John, you know, it's like, Hey, this is my personal friend John and I'm with the president of the university or something.

Speaker 2:          01:05:46       And they're like, so John, what do you do? And it's one of these, you want to be able to say, Oh, I have an mba or you know, yeah, do, um, rocket science stuff, but it's like a, I'm an archer. Yeah. I shoot a bow for living and they're just like, really? I'm a slingshot master. Yeah, exactly. But then you start, you start explaining what you're actually doing and you realize this is a, it's a really big world and it's, there's such great people there, you know, I have, I literally. It's really nice to be able to say I don't have any regrets in life because I'm in an industry that I love. I'm doing something that I really, really love and they're such good people around it. And all you have to do is get up every morning when the alarm goes off. Mine goes off pretty early and then just put in the work and, you know, I just think it's so cool to know that there's opportunity like that and there's a different path, a path that maybe perhaps other people hadn't considered.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       Oh yeah. Yeah. And just, you know, it's such a great country to live in to here in the states because you can take something that no one really might not believe in yourself. And if you apply the work to it, you can make it happen. And in traveling through all the different parts of the world that I've traveled, I've gone to places where you just, you know, you really wish you could give some of those people a chance because you can tell that they have such heart and such desire, but they don't have opportunity. And that's sad to me. That's, that's really sad that there's not opportunity everywhere. And then you come here and you see someone that has potential or opportunity, but they're lazy and they won't put in the work. They don't have the desperation, they don't have the desire, they don't have the drive, they don't.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       They don't. You know? I think a lot of times for some people when they're young, it's not enforced early on that when you work hard at something, it's really rewarding. When it's over and it's difficult to work hard at something, it's difficult to get your ass out of bed. It's difficult to force yourself to get up off the couch. It's difficult, but once you do it, it's always good. It always feels good and even if you do something and it doesn't work out well, like even if you are practicing archery in the shots, don't go well. It's silly. You're involved

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       in the discipline has given you something to concentrate on and that'll translate that energy and momentum will translate to the rest of your life. If you're working to improve at something, whether it's archery or Jujitsu or anything when you working to improve, improve on it. I firmly believe that that motivation and that momentum of improvement applies to the rest of your life and it's one of the things that people love about any particular discipline is the, the aspects of it and the qualities of it that sort of transfer onto your everyday life.

Speaker 2:          01:08:48       You know, it's weird because until you and I communicated some on the phone when I worked for an archery company and I was just a sales guy making calls. I never got to see faces. All ever heard was voices. So voices for me are always triggers because for 10 years I was just making calls when you and I first talked on the phone and I like heard your voice directly. Like from my device I actually realized I haven't even told you this, but I when I work out or when I shoot and a lot of times when I'm just working in my building, I've comprised like about five hours of a MP3. That's nothing but motivational sayings that I've heard someone say whether it's and I, that's all I play. It's my ambient sound and you are on there twice about just almost like what you just talked about, just a positive.

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       It was just a positive rant that you had about all people have to do is make a step in a direction and you might, you might look in the mirror one time and you don't like what's there, but you know, you have the opportunity to turn around and go a different way. And one thing that I really try to drive to people because there's times you talk to someone and you know that they're down in the dumps. You know, any one thing I tell people is, you know, motivation gets you going. Commitment keeps you going. You know, it's, it's no different than the new year's resolution. I fricking hate that. I hate if there's any time a, I don't want to go to the gym. It's two weeks after New Year's because it's like this swarm of people and all to me, there's people in there were like, you know what? Good for them. You know, they're, they're not in shape. Good for them to come here. But then it's so disappointing when it's like two days and they're gone. Yup. Yup. And you know, if you're, if you're at that stage and you're at the point where you're like, you know what, I want to change myself physically. It's funny how many

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       people won't even. It's funny how many people are going to the gym to work out, but they'll circle the gym parking lot like 10 times because they want the first row to open up. Your work is far away from the front door as you can and warm up by walking. You skip, skip to the loo. Well, I think a lot of people need a life coach. I think this is what I'm the conclusion. One of the things that I'm coming to in life is that, um, people need to either find a way to motivate themselves through all the different stuff that's available online. I mean, there's a million different websites and instagram pages and lots of youtube videos that show some motivation and they can help you. But we, human beings learn from each other. And I think most of the cultures in the past, not trying to glorify the past and say they had it nailed and we don't, but most of them were entitled knit groups and the emulated the behavior and the patterns of the successful members of that group.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       The leaders of that tribe. That's where traditions and came from. That's where skills were passed on and that's where ethics and that's where certain philosophies were passed down from generation to generation. These were the most beneficial to the community as a whole to the individual, to the culture, whatever the whatever it is. This world that we're living in today, we're almost in a lot of ways, like you were saying, people with so much opportunity but to lazy. We're almost in a lot of ways just lacking in a pattern, a correct pattern and a coach or a mentor or a person who is ahead of you, but honest like ahead of you as far as like maybe been alive longer or maybe had more experiences, but very honest about the difference between you and them. Because a lot of people think that you, you see some.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       Like we're talking about today, this is a ridiculous analogy, but when I was on MTV, we're talking about downtown Julie Brown because I was singing on the line and I remember thinking while you were saying that, like you, you go downtown, Julie Brown was probably on MTV back when you were unhappy. And I was like, yeah, but I was a peon. Like she wouldn't know who I was. I was on one of, you know, x amount of Comedians on the MTV half hour comedy hour. Like I couldn't probably couldn't even talk to her, say hi to her. And then I remember thinking like I put myself in that state of mind that I had back when I was 23 or whatever I was when I was on that show and I felt like insignificant and like, well that's downtown Julie Brown. And then I realized like now that that's nonsense.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       Like now I know that's nonsense, but in my head thinking about that time I felt like I did when I was 23. That like, yeah, that was your first reply. You're like, yeah, but I was just a p on that. And then all of a sudden, I think once you thought about first few seconds you're like, you know what, f that, well it's so ridiculous. But I did think that way back then. I think a lot of other people think that way now. You know, and whether it's a someone who's an aspiring archer that looks at your accomplishments and then looks at you back when you were this stalker kid hanging around a bowshot yeah. In comparison to how they are. And I think that that's a big, that's a big help to people to hear a story like that and to know that now you travel all over the world and you coach international teams and to see someone it admit that I think is very important to see someone discussed that I think is very important to a lot of us because we don't really.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       Most people don't have fucking mentors and most people aren't even involved in like a discipline that tests them in that manner. We're involved. A lot of people are involved in education, right? You go through high school, you go to college, get a degree, you're studying, you're practicing. But how much of that what you're doing has the aspects of the obsession with a discipline like archery or like Jujitsu or something along those lines. You're not getting the same intensity and focus. You're reluctant to do the work. You're doing it because you have to because you got to get a degree because you got to get a job because you don't want to be a loser and so you're pursuing these things with a lack of passion and then you enter into the workforce. Hopefully you're doing what you love. Most of the time people are not.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       Most of the time people are doing what they think is a good job that they can get by with and so they're committed to this path of not being excited, not being obsessed, and then not challenging themselves and not rising above and not gathering up some of the possible lessons that you can and it could be anything. It could be anything. If you want to make knives, if you love making jackets, if you like painting, it doesn't. There's no one particular thing that it should be for you. You just have to find out whatever starts that spark in you. For you. It was archery. For me, it was standup comedy, you know, or martial arts, you know, it could be, it could really be anything, but I think we need things like that. If people don't have things like that, if they just work and then they go home and they watch TV and they work and they go home and watch tv, you're not, you're not fucking living life at level 10, you're not going to hit it. You're never gonna feel that. And I'm not saying you're gonna be at level 10 every day, but there's going to be some moments like when you were talking about, you know, being on the line, you know, wha to archers, this is the for one shot, for the gold medal and alert that, that feeling, those, those feelings are integral to being a human being. The feelings of being challenged and of learning what you're capable of and what you're not capable of through

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       those challenges. Absolutely. And the thing is too, you have to be able, when you've made that decision, the next thing that you should come to terms with is say, you know what? I'm going to push myself further and I've ever pushed myself and I know damn good and well there's going to be a block. There's gonna be resistance. I heard in a podcast for me long ago, you talked about the book, the war of art. I bought it, Steven Pressfield. I bought it. So you know, it talks about resistance and actually you know, with you learning this new release for your archery, I told you before you even made your first shot, there is going to be a point where you're not going to like this and you need to know right now that we're going to push through it. So a lot of times when people make that determination and that decision in life, have, you know what? I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to get ready. You need to also think you know what? There's going to be. I'm going to have a voice in my head that's going to tell me this is too hard and I'm going to have a point of resistance, but I'm telling myself right now when I get that, that's my opportunity to go further than I've ever had in the past. I know right now that when I get to that I am pushing through it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:28       If you're only focused on one particular goal and not seeing the obvious distractions or things that are going to, that you know are going to be in that path and mentally build, build up yourself to know when I get to that resistance, I am driving through. You know, I listen to that podcast with Steve [inaudible] and he talked about. He knew he was ready to beat his habits and when he was in there and they're like telling him that he should be going. He's like, no, I want. Like, he probably knew deep down inside that if he left, he was. That was, it was gonna be an opportunity for him to fail. So he had already made up his mind that he was going through that. And so many people in life just don't push that one time and then they never really see how far they can go. You know, I heard like, um, one time I heard Les Brown say, um, you know, would you rather go through life? I'm aiming too high and miss or aiming too low and hit.

Speaker 2:          01:19:41       I mean, I would rather aim high and fall short and still be further ahead then aiming too low and hitting exactly a low goal. You know, I think you have to be willing to fail and get good at it. I lost way more tournaments than I've ever won. And some of the people that like question why I'm at where I'm at in archery that are, well, we never won that much. You know what? I'm probably lost more than anybody. That's good. But I dang sure know that it made me a better person. And then when I lost, I was at the tournament the next week making sure that I worked on whatever it was that caused me to lose. You know, I think I remember a guy one time saying, you know, you haven't really figured out how to win yet, but, and that's critical for an athlete.

Speaker 1:          01:20:34       Well, it's critical that that moment that happens in any competition where you're worried about the event, you're worried about the outcome and that worry can overwhelm your abilities. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:20:46       Yeah, absolutely. And when you get to that point, you have to be willing to dig deep down and say, you know what? This is what I've worked for. I knew this was coming. You know, if it, if there wasn't nervousness and the possibility of defeat or victory, then there probably wouldn't be any sense of inner accomplishment to it. You've literally done everything you can to get to that moment. That's a defining moment. So which way are you going to go, you know? Then you have a decision to make. And for me, my victories were so much sweeter because I had failed a lot before that and it got to the point where I remember being in a match one time and I had taken like several second thirds leading up to that and I remember getting there and I just, I closed my eyes on that last Arrow and I just am like, I'm freaking sick. Have blown it, screw that. I'm not doing it again. I'm going to make a good shot.

Speaker 1:          01:21:53       Visual rocky movie. Yeah. Yeah. And then. So I just closed my eyes and made

Speaker 2:          01:22:02       the shot. And then when I made it, the victory seems so much sweeter because I had pushed through adversity to get there. You know? I think that's, that's what I love about archery is that, you know, one day you're so good and then the next day you know, you see flaws and you see mistake.

Speaker 1:          01:22:20       What's a long rabbit hole too? That's the weirdest thing about archery. You wouldn't think it's such a long rabbit hole. There's so much to learn. So many different places to go. And there's so many people that your watch, you watch TV. I've, I've taken to, I watch hunting shows much to the Chagrin of my family. I think it's Hilarious, but some of them are so bad. They're so, they're such bad production. Like if you want to learn bad television, like say if you're a person out there that's aspiring to do a TV show, there's some, there's some hunting shows out there that look like they were made by blind people that were drunk and the animals, like they, they, they, especially the archery shows they fucking miss more than they hit them. I mean if someone from like if wanted to make an argument against the ethical use of archery for hunting, all they need to do and where to go watch some of those fucking shows. But it's this. I think it's, you know, it's a difficult thing to do and some people kind of half asset and some of those people that do have acid, they're on television.

Speaker 2:          01:23:24       Well, and that brings up a really good point because I know a lot of people that probably are listening that you either know myself or know that you're a hunting advocate and a conservationist like myself. We owe it to ourselves as an art, you know, as a hunting community to realize that there's a big opposition pushing back and we have a responsibility to represent ourselves ethically and also appreciate other people's feelings and you know, appreciate that there are people that might not like it and you really have an opportunity to either do something that's going to really piss them off. Or if you're going to maybe do something to where it'll at least let them keep an open mind. Now.

Speaker 1:          01:24:12       Well, the best way to do that I think is have conversations about it. Oh yeah. I mean, I can't tell you how many facebook messages and twitter messages I've gotten from people that have told me that they had a particular view, a negative view about hunting and until they listen to like maybe a podcast with Steve Rinella or Cameron Hanes or Jim shockey, and they realize like, oh, this is not what I think it is. Not only is it not what I think it is, you must do something to control these animal populations. And the one thing, I've said this before, but I'm gonna. Say it again to anybody that thinks there's no reason to ever kill wild animals. I have two words for you. Feral pigs. You can't. You better do something because if you don't do something, they will fucking overwhelmed the earth. What about people? Man? People are overwhelming. Earth team that. Yeah, I like people. You can have sex with them, you can talk to them and you go to the movies with them. They make cars. I'm a big fan of Pete,

Speaker 2:          01:25:09       except people that make parking lots. They're making some narrow parking. Listen. Oh, foreign. Okay. Somewhere in the. Somewhere in the last 10 years, whoever was working for like American and United Airlines that made economy plus and then took the big dump on the regular economy seats for someone finally fired those people and then they started designing parking lots because fricking you can't park your junk in anything anymore. They never have an obvious way to like get to the Strip mall. That's right next door. They make you like exit the Fricken Pac man exit or like you have to go around all the ghosts and shit to like finally get to the one way to get out and then turn and go down to get into the next one. Well they definitely try to shove

Speaker 1:          01:25:52       too many spots in places like, uh, I was somewhere recently. Oh Santa Barbara where it's real nice, but there's not that many people. And one of the things I noticed when I was there, it was like, well how the parking spots are the nice and wide because they're not overwhelmed by the same amount of people. There's only like a 100,000 people in all of Santa Barbara. It's like an easier way to get around down there. Yeah. Like that Cam and there's too many. God. Damn. I don't want to remember. You ready to move Jamie's thumbs up from Jamie. What's that? We're moving to Santa Barbara. Fuck it. Let's do that.

Speaker 1:          01:26:28       Do you need a person to like you need a full time range manager? They need to build a range. That's the next step. If I get deeper and deeper with this amount of open up an archery shop. I think so for sure. I think, uh, an archery school would be the way to go. Honestly. I really think that there were a lot of different martial arts schools and I've been involved in a bunch of them and I think that a teaching martial arts is gigantic, but one of the things that's a problem with archery and most particularly with bow hunting is the learning curve is extremely steep and it's not obvious at all as to where to start. The learning curve to start archery is just go to an archery store, go to a shop. But I mean, I've had experience with shops that didn't know what they were doing and went there and I got bad advice from them and I saw people that really didn't exactly know what they were doing and they were telling me, Oh, you don't need that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:16       Oh you don't need this. And there's so many people out there that probably would be interested in, in archery. And I know there's a lot of people that are interested in hunting as well. They just don't know where to start. And I think having like classes in a liquor shop is probably a really good idea and probably something I'm going to get into in the future. Well I want to see that. Yeah, no I wouldn't let them in, but I would have to a grand open. Alright man you're in. But I would have to most certainly have people that were there that were really good, that could teach classes and teach people how to do it. You know, like we were showing you show me the video of your son hunting alligators. And I said it right as you were saying. I was like, look at his form, like your kid is like, it's perfect form like a world champion archer, like the ways God has his posture, the way he released and when you know we're, we're, we're, we're watching that.

Speaker 1:          01:28:11       I was thinking, well, here's a kid that has learned from the beginning how to do it correctly. So when you look at him as opposed to that picture that you sent me of the archer that's on television, that as a, uh, an arrow that he's pulling back his string is deep, tucked into his face were for sure. When you're pulling your string back and it's digging into your face, the, the pressure of your face on that string is going to change the path of the hour. You should never supposed to dig it into your face. Like this guy has it. Then you look down, his Arrow is not even attached to the string. It's like hanging off and he doesn't even know it. It is the most. And this guy is on television and that fucking picture was used for an ad. The picture was on an ad, which means they took the picture, somebody looked at it and they were so careless that they weren't good enough.

Speaker 1:          01:28:59       Keep going. We got it, nailed it, and they took that and they put it on television. I'm ordered to put it in a magazine or what have you. But when you see someone who started from the beginning, like your son with perfect form it. How old was he in? At like 10. Yeah, he started when he was nine. So in that picture, what would that video with the alligator tab, when you see that as opposed to someone who's been doing it wrong their whole life. You realize the importance of original technique, like having it like the original lessons. The first lesson is you get imprinting correctly,

Speaker 2:          01:29:32       yo. Yeah. Yeah. And that's a big part of what I'm doing. Can I plug the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. Well your, your show,

Speaker 1:          01:29:39       which is called knock on TV. It's on a sport. What's not departments channel sportsmans channel. And they're both owned by the same people. Now the outdoor channel and the sportsman channel are both owned by the same people.

Speaker 2:          01:29:50       And then, you know, the youtube site, knock on archery, there's a lot of, if you go through there and if you're not a hunter, then move past that because there's a lot of how to stuff and that's the direction that I'm really going to be going. The whole focus on this brand. Um, knock on which I think I had, I think I have a hat on. Um, you know, it's, it was a brand intended for people that aren't really necessarily wanting to say I'm a hunter, but I'm an archer and so much of what this show is geared around and it took a long time for me to convince the network for me to dedicate. You know, right now I have three segments that are, how to be better with your form when the dead center segment. Then the field recon segment is how to be better in the field as an hunter, you know, some type of a technique. And then I have the third segment called knocked and ready to rock, which last year was literally how to buy a bow and completely set up the boat, start to finish throughout the whole.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       And there's a video of that. Oh, it's over an hour long. It's on Youtube, which is a very difficult time consuming and involved process. Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       And then this year the knocked and ready to rock segment is all about learning to build your own arrows. But as I move forward through the seasons and through the, through the Youtube Channel, I'm going to continue to try to work on building all these fundamentals to become a good shooter. And Harry and my wife, they both started out with no experience at all. And it's funny how if you show the basic fundamentals and you're taught right from the very beginning, how easy you can get to perfect form. It's when you go into it with like, you know, I always say women and kids are way easier to teach. And then guys, because there's not the macho factor, you know, guys are like, Shit Dude, I know how to grab care. Give me that. I'll show you how to do it. Also do being a loser. Yup. Whereas

Speaker 1:          01:31:49       people who are not worried about, man, if I fuck this up, damn dude, I'm a loser in this cause of winter. Like there's a lot of people that don't like learning things because they don't want to fuck

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       up. You know, and I think when you, you teach a, a woman or a young person, they have less ego. They don't think of themselves as being this shit yet. Oh, well there were women don't just say, just don't have as many ego problems has been do in that regard. Well there's two. There's two t, you know, I've, I've, I've looked a lot into sports psychology and I won the first time I talked to you. One of the things where I was really hoping you could help me with and if anyone's listening out there that's like a sports psychologist. I actually, I have a, I have a big add problem. I'm very. But it also has been a huge part of my success as an archer because I zone things out. There's times where I've been in competitions, people come up to me and say, Hey, sorry, I bumped you with the camera or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:32:48       It's like when. Because I like, I don't like, you're so tunnel visioned on stuff. So you see heads in those tunnels. Yeah. The head's kind of was a distraction. That was my adderall. But yeah, I've, I've really wondered, you know, is is a d, d or You know that. Is that like an asset to get in the zone faster? But yeah, we talked about that and my, my issue is what is add, you know, I'm not exactly sure that everyone who has add is really has a disorder, a lot of that. Right. I think a lot of is a style of thinking or way of thinking. You know right now, like my dad's a psychologist and it's amazing to me how many people will, you know, I've got friends that will like go to the shrink for a 30 minute session. Then they're like, oh, I got some adderall.

Speaker 2:          01:33:41       Do to get add really bad when I got, when I got diagnosed with mine, I went for three different days and almost did like a psychological evaluation. I mean it was like questioning, questioning, questioning, and I remember like reading through this thing that, that uh, that a true psychologist did to diagnose what I had. And I remember one of the lines said it was like one of the beginning lines. It's like John has always been a fairly normal boy. He never had a problem soiling his linens or something like that. It was. That sounds like someone became a serial killer. John has always been a normal boy until we found the one hand sticking out of the dirt in the backyard. We never suspected anything. That's kind of what it was like. But, but it's a d and D is add recognized a hundred percent. Like is it a universally recognized? Like there's an issue with add? I would say. So they argue, they argue that it's the case against add. How about that Google that they shot? They argue that there's more, there's more people coming, you know, that are saying they have add and I think because doctors are so quick to prescribe nowadays, but what does it, what does it mean? It means attention deficit disorder. So what is exactly that mean? Well, for me, sometimes

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       people are talking to maybe when I'm so zoned out on something else, I never hear it. You know, there's just constant distraction. There's constant distraction. If I'm tuned into you then you know, a lot of times like, you know, I'll be focused on something and my wife like has to snap at me like a dog see, but that to me is not attention deficit disorder. That's not attention deficit it. Oh, that's extreme attention on one thing. Just an unwillingness to engage with distractions, but then there's times what's weird about it is then there's times where you're trying to focus on something and it's like every stimuli comes into play. One of those things that you're trying to focus on, is it ever anything that you're really interested in or is it just some shit you have to do, like fix a pipe or you know, certainly there's times where people are talking to you and you really don't want to listen to them.

Speaker 1:          01:35:52       That's the. I have a feeling that's what attention deficit disorder is. People are bored as fuck or that is what every casino. There's this wide range of the way people think and the way people address situations like you couldn't even see it in your children. Like have my middle child is very outgoing and very loud and silly and she'll talk to anybody but my youngest child, she. If she doesn't know you, she ain't saying shit. I know. Say Hi to her and she was like, whatever dude, she'll hide behind me. I can talk to this guy. Like she just has her own style of engaging with people and they both also have their own very distinct likes and dislikes. As far as like the kind of TV shows they like or the kind of toys they like or the kind of art that they do and I just think that that same variety applies to things that people are interested in and not interested in in life.

Speaker 1:          01:36:49       And we take these fucking kids, man, and this is a big part of the problem with education. There's a lot of different jobs out there and the path for a guy who wants to be a professional archer versus the path for a guy wants to be an audio engineer. These are very different paths and they involve very different amounts of data, different, different kinds of data, different stimuli. And we take people and especially when they're young, we make them pay attention to shit they don't give a fuck about and I don't think it's good for them. And I think we see like when I was in high school they always said, oh, he doesn't pay attention. He's got no pr. Put something in front of me that I care about and that's all I pay attention to. So it's not that I'm a fucking Ne'er do well, but you, you make me feel like I am made me feel like I'm a loser because I don't give a fuck about math or Spanish history.

Speaker 1:          01:37:37       Sorry, it's not ringing my 13 year old head. I'm thinking about tits right now and I have time for Spanish history. I don't give a fuck, but you might talk to me about pirates and all of a sudden for whatever reason that spark gets lead and now I'm interested and now I'm obsessed with pirates and I want to read books about pirates and I want to talk about pirates is sorts of different things that people get excited about and interested in. But the problem I think, or one of the problems with formalized education and are some for some strange reason, our need to diagnose certain styles of thinking and certain styles of approaching life as problematic as add or he's got, you know, he's got adhd. Oh, he's just, he can't stop. He's in a fucking classroom. They're teaching nonsense. He's sitting on a plastic chair.

Speaker 1:          01:38:25       He wants to run through the fucking wall. It's everything. I could do, I have a neighbor and sometimes it's got corners me, okay. And he'll tell me some stupid shit about his son's basketball game or some other shit and I literally want to run up a tree. I just want to and I don't have add. I'm not, I'm not unwilling Adhd, I'm fucking bored man. And you're kidnapping me with this stupid goddamn conversation. And I'm like Yay, look at the time, got to go. So I told him, you know, if you're going to get some time on that bench. And that's how I felt when I was in school. I felt a lot of that in school and I think that that's a lot of what's going on. We're all interested in different shit and formalized education in a lot of circles and a lot of schools. It's just too limited for some of the kids in class.

Speaker 2:          01:39:11       I remember Harry, his first football team, I'm thinking he was like nine or 10 and one of the kid shows up with like a big can of monster and he's drinking it in the. And we were trying to control the kid and I went over to mom and I said like, you know, and it was every day, how old is this kid? He was 10. All My. And I remember going over and the mom said, the mom goes, yeah, we just have such a problem control. And the thing is it was eight in the morning for a football game. And she goes, we just, he just never listened. I mean the doctor says he has add and I'm like, you just gave him a green monster at eight in the morning. He's 10 and he had like a double can of monster. I'm talking the big ones. How much do you think he weighed? A hundred pounds.

Speaker 1:          01:40:00       Cheeses. That's. I could be wrong, but that's more than two adult size servings could be wrong, but I think I know the problem. Yeah. It might be your kids on crank. I mean that's crank. That's like extreme doses of caffeine and sugar and sugar in those things. And you don't even know what else. Really. Yeah. And you know what man, they gotta stop selling you some Shit and saying it's more than one serving five that you can't do that anymore. You got to stop doing that. If it's in one package and it's like a drink, that's a fucking serving. Stop saying it

Speaker 2:          01:40:36       to servant. Yeah. Unless it's like a box of like something. You know that you're going to cook. If it's a box that's multiple surveys, don't tell me this bottle of waters to fricking service.

Speaker 1:          01:40:49       Well that's fine. Well, he'd say it well you could say that. No, that's fine. Because there's no. There's no negative consequences and drinking a bottle of water. It's universally agreed that an eight ounce bottle of water or it's not going to hurt anybody, but one of those fucking monster energy drinks, or my trainer had a protein bar the other day. It was like a small one to men. It was only like maybe three inches long. It was a small protein bar. And he goes, oh, I gotta get my protein bar. Go your candy bar. I'm fucking with him. I go, Dude, you're eating candy. He goes, no man. I go, how many grams of sugar in that? And he goes, nine. I go, really? I go, how many servings in each bar goes, no way. I go check. He goes, fuck. I go, that's 18 grams of sugar in that little tiny thing. It's a candy.

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       Yeah, absolutely. I coached that with teams actually because when I competed, the one thing that I think was that I found really, really helpful is to be able to travel and keep yourself in your same daily routine with your rest and your diet and more importantly your garbage intake because people will go to a tournament and then they'll pop in and they'll grab like, you know, a power bar, you know, like the chocolate covered power bar. And then they go to a tournament and they're like having a snack and then all of a sudden like two targets that either like, I don't know what's up, I'm kind of like bouncing all over the place and I'm thinking, you're on your own. You just had 40 grams of sugar. And they're like, when? And I go, well, you just say that, um, marathon bar, you know, 19 grams of sugar per serving. Yeah, double it. You know, you just like totally had a full blown insulin drop, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:42:33       And you do have one too. You know, I've been on this crazy diet now for two months and I stepped off of the other day. I had a cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. Ooh, wait, wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth it. But it was, it was worth, it was worth something. It was worth something while I was eating it. It was glorious. It was a wonderful cheeseburger with blue cheese and bacon. It was very good. And the chocolate shake, it was pretty God damn good. And the chocolate shake, it was a chocolate malt. In fact, pretty God damn good but good Lord because I haven't been eating that way. The crash after it was over, it was devastating. Like I could barely stay awake an hour later because my insulin level, just my whole body was just like, what did you do after months? Two months of eating clean. You just took a shit in your mouth. And I recognized that that had probably been been in normal thing for me for most of my life. If I'd eaten a cheeseburger and a shake within an hour afterwards, I just was crashed. I was just done. But that's most people, the way they eat all the time, they just get used to that terrible feeling.

Speaker 2:          01:43:42       When I. When I give seminars, you know, a lot of times you have a lunch break and I pay attention to the people when they hit the lunch break. I pay attention to like what some people are eating because you can tell a lot by a person, by what they're throwing. If you've got an option of something good or something crap. There's some people that just like go right for the crap. Then there's some people that go for the good stuff. As soon as like your session starts back up, and I'm sure you've done this where you give like speeches or seminars after meals, there's always like for people that are like out and they can't help it, right? Because they ate a bunch of garbage and they had this huge insulin dump and you know, they've their bodies like trying to fight off all that and then they crash and a lot of times I'll like wake people up and I'll say, okay, I was waiting for that to happen because now is what I want to talk about the importance of nutrition during performance because the reason several people in here can't stay awake right now is because of what they did during their lunch break.

Speaker 2:          01:44:51       A lot of, a lot of events, sports related events that are like all day events. They have breaks. Archery always had a break at noon. I never wanted to be hungry at the break. I tried to continually pick and hydrate throughout the whole event just like I do at home during the day so that I wasn't starving. You see competitors that are leading the pack and they run to the fricking concession stand and they want to like pound two or three burgers because they know that they're not going to get to eat til 5:00 and then all of a sudden their scores just start to peter out and they start making mistakes and then all of a sudden towards the end they come back again and they're saying like, Hey, I just had that fricking though several ends. I just struggled and it's like, how do you think? Yeah. Well, at the time I wasn't like telling all my competitors online. I saw that cover

Speaker 1:          01:45:46       well until you try to live clean, until you try to eat clean and you don't eat cheeseburgers and shakes. You don't understand how much of an impact it really has because I think people associate how they feel with just normalcy. They think that, well, this is just what happens. You know, at the end of the day, I get tired, man. I need naps. When I started drawing this primal diet, the MERC system diet and I started, I brought my body into a state of ketosis. Yep. Was the first time ever that in between meals. I didn't have that crash. Why didn't feel terrible where like I could go six, seven hours and not feel bad at all because your body, when it hits that state is starting to burn off the fat and so your body has a supply of fat, so it just starts converting the fat in your body to energy. It's amazing. It's amazing that so few people eat and live like this. Yeah. That was a.

Speaker 2:          01:46:39       That was really interesting because the one thing I asked you was I said, what's really the difference between that and the Adkins? Right. More fats and that was, to me, it made. Then, you know, where the Atkins, there's a lot more focused on the protein. You know, I get people that are uneducated on eating clean, you know, we look at what we, you and I just ate for lunch. I mean we like knocked back and avocado, like nothing. Some people are afraid of anomaly ocado because they say it's fattening. I mean talk about not knowing what's up. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:47:09       they don't understand what dietary fats and the importance of certain amounts of healthy fats, of getting the amount of oils and fats that your body needs. Healthy oils super important and avocado oil and Avocados in general, one of the most healthy fats you can consume, super, super good for you. You know, and getting the right amount of nutrients in your body has just such a massive effect on how the whole goddamn thing works. And again, I go back to the mentor thing and the life coach thing because until you have talked to someone that you trust that that's done it and is there, you know, until you know some guy who's a competitive marathon or something like that. And he says, listen, you know, if you do this, your body will work better. You got to trust me. You got to trust me and try to clean up your diet and try to, you know, just if most people just cut out just one thing at a time, they would see a big difference.

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       I actually have a thing that I call having, um, I've got a ton of success stories of hunters that were motivated by posts that I made with like food or, you know, they just see a post that I do and they're like, I really, I'm just tired of where I'm at. As, you know, billy bob the bow hunter or you know, I'm tired of where, where I'm at archery. I've never been in it 10 years and I've never made progress. What do I need to do? You know, I'll get some photos of them in. A lot of times I notice that they're out of shape and I'm like, listen, if you're shooting on a line and you look down and you can't see your feet because, you know, a big part of my shot routine is, is the first step is really your feet. You know, your stance.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       I mean like imagine martial arts, you're, you know, you're trying to talk someone about their stance. I can't even see their feet. Well it's like, okay, well we need to address another problem as well, you know, you might not want to hear this but we need to address this problem. And for me when I started down that path, because I had about three years of my life where I, you know, it's funny how when it comes to like the path of an Arrow or the path of life, all it takes is the smallest movement to get you going a certain direction and then all sudden before you know it, you're like so far off the course and you're like, how the hell did I get here? And, and I had a point in my career, I was that way. I was like, you know, I was like, I remember I had to, I put on like a pair of 38 underwear and I was like, what the hell?

Speaker 2:          01:49:39       You know, I used to wear like 30, 38 pants. Now I'm in a 38 freaking. And then I look at my legs because, you know, I've got a good story about big bird, but I always like, I've got big bird legs, you know, and I'm thinking frick, that's how round my waist is, as long as that fricking leg, that's how big around I am. So what I started doing was just having. And every time I ordered my normal meal at a restaurant, if it comes out and there's a burger, I took half the bun and I just like. And then half the fries fricking slit them off and I gave them to the lady and said, can you take that? And I would literally eat half the carbs that was on my plate. I just have everything as soon as it came out. So I was in my normal routine in life.

Speaker 2:          01:50:25       If Sharon and I went to applebee's or whatever and I ordered my normal little meal. If it was a carb or junk, whatever they gave me as a portion, I halved it. And I mean just that. And then getting rid of like soda and all of a sudden it was just like zoom in a matter of months. You've just completely like change your directional path and once you've done the amount of calories and once you get to that point, you're motivated by what you're seeing. And then it's like, I'm going to have that again. Like normally I'm used to having this, I'm going to have that again. And you know, there's times where I might feel like bread, like I told you that for the most part I don't like, you know, I feel really good when I'm not eating starch or carbs. I feel way better that way. However, certain carbs or I think really critical for times where, you know, there's times where I'm needing to write or I'm needing to speak and I kinda just feel fuzzy in the head. And for me it sometimes I think it's like your cognitive is like craving some brain foods so we should try some ketones to. I'm going to get you some exemptions. Ketones for digging, trying your, your dietary routine. It's

Speaker 1:          01:51:40       good. Exonerations ketones have a big effect on mental function is very, very healthy for you too. It's all, it's not, not junk, not stimulants, you know, just just healthy foods. You know, one of the things, one of the ways that, uh, I got to know Cameron Hanes is um, because uh, in being on a few hunts and going into the mountains and experiencing what it's like just to hike at high altitude, just really underestimated the amount of stress that it takes on your body, how difficult it is to do. And so then I started researching fitness and fitness and hunting. I'm like, there's got to be someone out there that's like really into it. And then I found cam, just a fitness fucking nut does ultra marathons and all that jazz. And that's how cam and I became friends is by looking at his, his sort of style of getting ready for the mountains.

Speaker 1:          01:52:29       Like pretty much all of what he does with his weight training, whether it's just running, running mountains. It's preparing him to be a better hunter. And I don't think many people that view hunting considered that they think of hunting as being a fat guy who's beer waiting for a deer to pass by so he could shoot it in the Dick. You know what I mean? That's, that's. That's how a lot of people look at hunting. They look at as a bunch of cruel assholes or that dentist guy who goes over to Africa and shoots a line and fucks it up. That's how a lot of people look at hunting and that's one of the reasons why hunting has a bad rap, especially in terms of its benefit and as a tool for conservation. People will say, well, that's. That's bullshit. The only reason why people call it a conservation tool because it gives them an excuse to kill animals.

Speaker 1:          01:53:19       Most of the money, most of the money to preserve wetlands, to preserve wildlife habitat. Most of that money is a direct result of hunting mostly lately. Totally. That's a fact. It's an undeniable fact. So all these people out there that are calling themselves conservationists that never donate and then they'll say something mean and rude about hunting and even eat a cheeseburger after they say it. Like there's a lot of fucking crazy intellectual dishonesty out there when it comes to this subject and also in terms of what we should or shouldn't do in terms of being the stewards of the earth. Like we were talking about like wild pigs. If you don't think that we should do something to control the population of wild pigs, it's because you've never been around wild pigs. They have two, three litters a year. They'll have three or four babies every litter, litter and they fucking keep going and get more than that. How many of you they get and what is it like, hey eggs, I'm guessing seven to 10 in the litter and how many liters a year? At least two, right?

Speaker 2:          01:54:16       Yeah. I think it's a, what is it? Every three months I can chuck them out. Well, they can. Chuck went out and six months after being born, which is saying, oh yeah, yeah, it's there. I mean, it's, it's amazing how one or two pigs turns into an absolute problem really fast and even even at your house, you know, people, there's people that give me slack if I, you know, I posted that video of that coyote I shot and then you know about the wolf thing, but people have a problem with that and it's like, dude, we were in your yard and your wife comes out and there's like two Qa to coyotes in the yard, like scoping out your chicken house. And then when she took the kids to school, she ends up telling us, yeah, there's a coyote running down the road with the fricking rooster hanging out of it's mouth.

Speaker 2:          01:55:00       Yeah, they're common. I mean, they're like, you have to, you have to control some of that. And I have to control Predator populations because nothing else does. And white tails. I'm telling you, I'm frank. Zane, he was a three time Mr Olympia frank used to do are you still does? He still does, but frank and arnold used to do archery as kind of an rnr, you know, from their bodybuilding. That was kind of there. There's in their stress relief was shooting and um, when I went to the Arnold and competed a frank and Anne frank and Arnold ended up coming in to have like a, an old cow, like a competition like from the old days, so they into the hall to like each of them shoot. Well, what Arnold didn't know was frank was so competitive that frank actually talked to the coordinator of the event and he called her and said who are there any really good archers coming that can coach.

Speaker 2:          01:56:03       So she asked around and ended up connecting frank to me. So when frank and I talked, I was like a big fan of them because I was a fitness guy for my stress relief and he wanted coaching because he goes, when Arnold Nice shoot together, I don't want them to think that I've practiced but I want to fricking beat him. So I actually like worked with them a little bit and he did end up, you know, he ended up shooting and then frank and I became friends and he's, you know, he's an animal he's from. He's down from San Francisco, South San Francisco. I think, and he never really talked negative about me when he knew that I was a hunter and stuff, but I could tell it wasn't necessarily something that he favored, but I will absolutely. But he, he wasn't against it. He wasn't like dead set against it.

Speaker 2:          01:56:54       I think he just isn't interested in. Right. So I pick them up at the airport and we're driving back and he said, so do you like hunt deer all the time? And I said, yeah, I have them all the time. And he's like, he's like, well, how Kinda, how do you, how do you feel about it? And I said, you have to do it. And he's just like, really? And he never said anything negative, but I remember we were three miles from my house in a fricking deer comes across the road and we're like in my little Hyundai accent and I fricking smoke this thing. And he's like, he's just like, oh shit. Like, he's like, he's never seen like a fricking animals smashed the car. And um, and he's just like, that was a freaking deal. We just hit a deer. And I said, yeah dude, imagine if 850,000 people in the state of Wisconsin weren't out hunting a year. Eight hundred and $50,000.

Speaker 1:          01:57:49       Is that how many? Yeah, between Bowen gun owners, you can look it up. I was in Wisconsin for opening season not last year, but the year before last and the morning light is like a war just started. It was like, remember when we used to watch like shocking all, like when the shock and all happen. That's what it sounds like. Well, we talked about Michigan on the podcast before that in last year or every year, 50,000 car accidents involving deer a year just in Michigan alone. And so people that think, well, there's no other way to take care of that. This is what people have to understand. Unless you want to bring in wolves and guess what? You don't want to bring in wolves, wolves in your neighborhood. You don't want to look that in the face. Yeah. Well you did. You know, I've, I've talked. That story's crazy. I was telling a friend of mine about it, the, uh, the story of you, you were in Alberta and you shot elk and these wolves

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       circled the elk. How many, how many wolves were there? Well, at first there was just the one, the one came in and you know, the one came in on us and I, and I, and that's what I do want to say off the beginning. One thing that I always do as a hunter is I always buy or Predator tag if it's available, if I know that I can get that I can buy a tag for coyotes or wolves. I always have one in my pocket because you do see, you know, they're out there and they're out there way more now and this. And this is an exact reason why he got to do it because literally we had an elk down and next thing you know, we're out there kind of, you know, getting it ready to like, you know, to cut it up and stuff and get it out of there and all sudden this big wolf comes through, you know, comes in.

Speaker 2:          01:59:33       And I had spotted it and we weren't really being noisy, so I ended up shooting that wolf and it kind of went off and you know, with a bow there's no noise. So what we didn't realize was there was a pack there and that, that was actually, it was an Alpha female is because of the size of it. I mean you saw the size of it is as big as me and it actually went off and then we kinda thought, oh, was freaky. Freaky will. Then about 20 minutes later all of a sudden we see another one and we see another one and we're kinda like, holy crap. So we start moving into this draw. And one of them was like making a noise, almost like it was injured or something. I was whimpering. So we're like, what is the deal? So we were on high ground with the elk and then we started moving down into this ravine because we saw the, the wolves down in there.

Speaker 2:          02:00:28       And next thing you know, we get down in there and I start looking around and there's like hair on the trees. There's like, I mean, it looked like that movie into the gray, the gray, the gray, that's exactly what it looked like. Liam Neeson. There was like frick and Harry turds everywhere. It was just, there was like beds, there was hair rubbed on the trees and I start looking around, there's like holes dug in and I'm like, I literally look at my two buddies that were there with me and I said right in their fricking den, like, you know, and I think we had that elk was not too far, you know, our elk wasn't too far when you shot an elk that they probably thought of as there's. Oh they definitely thought of it was there. So yeah, they, they definitely thought that was theirs.

Speaker 2:          02:01:14       So then once we're down there, all of a sudden we hear this. How were like down there, we hear this how, and it was definitely an Alpha because an Alphas the how. It literally turns your blood instantly cold if you're right in on a true wolf howl. It's, I mean it's like so freaking low and deep and it's just like chills your blood, what you realize. It's not a game. Yeah. Then I realized I'm like, we're in their fricking Dan and you know, I'm kind of looking down. I'm like, okay, well I shot an elk. Then I shot that. I've got two arrows left. So, and you know, both my guides kind of had, you know, once we said, oh there's wolves. They like grabbed a gun. We kind of went down in there to see what was up. Well now this happens and next thing after that Alpha sounded off, it was like,

Speaker 2:          02:02:07       and I mean 12, I think it was 12, sounded off all the way around us. We're in a, we're, we're literally down. Anyone who's been in Alberta, you know, that the farm land is level and then it falls into the river system. So we're literally, they have the high ground, there's a dozen wolves and we're in the middle and we're like, what the crap. So I just, I'm like get you back to a tree. So we kinda all spin around and we're sitting there and next thing you know here comes to dogs on a full blown. I'm talking like full blown like this running, coming and I mean it turned into chaos. There was like bullets flying. I mean there's freaking arrows skipping off junk. And we ended up shooting both of those wolves dead and there's a few gunfire going off while I'm down to like one Arrow left and I told the guy, I said how many bullets you got?

Speaker 2:          02:03:00       And he goes, well I didn't, I, you know, I just grabbed the gun to a couple of bullets. Like I didn't know where this was all going down. So count, we're kind of like we need to get out of here. So we started backing up and next thing you know, they, the Alpha sounded off again and they all reported this time there's only two or two less. So next thing I know, I'm like kind of we're trying to back out. So when you say, hold on a second, you say they reported there. So there's, they know that two were dead. Yeah. So all of them are howling. I'm certain that the first. How was the Alpha male pretty much saying in is everyone in position because then they all like. Yes, yes. All the way around. Then all of a sudden the to come, all hell breaks loose.

Speaker 2:          02:03:53       Then we're like the alpha sounds again, but he's in a different location. He was actually to my left like right here and it really close and I mean it's thick in there. You've been there, you know how thick it gets. So then they sound awful. Now this time there's two less, so I'm kind of looking because I know this wolf that sounded was and I know it's the Alpha so I like grabbed my boa and I start kinda creeping over there and as soon as I get to where I can see he's like fricking standing right there. And how far our 30 yards wolf can cover jamie. Pull up that picture from Joe's instagram. Like it was about a week ago. You found those pictures of those wolves? Yeah. I forget who the photographer was. There got some amazing photographs or. Yeah, it was. It was like not the most recent one that was on that dead Moose.

Speaker 2:          02:04:52       But it was from national geographic. That was actually a bison. Those from yesterday. That's right. Yesterday or the day before. Look at that. That right there. That is exactly the face that I saw in the. Anybody was head on. He wasn't broad side, but that face where he was literally looking at me like that. And I mean you're in a fight or flight like I'm in. Totally in a fight or flight. I had one arrow left on my string. I fricking grabbed my bow. I literally, I like, I just, I kinda looked at him. I knew at that moment it was like he was coming. Yeah. That's like fricken Deja Vu, right? The twitter, the instagram page. Jamie

Speaker 1:          02:05:33       do go back up a little bit is c j I m underscore photography and if you go to that guy's instagram page has got amazing photographs just. And he's out there with them. There was another one that I had and it's just right before that, Jamie, the. Before that Wolf picture, there was another wolf picture. That one. Look at that one man, he's got snow all over his face and his teeth are.

Speaker 2:          02:05:55       That's cool. Yeah, that's a cool picture. Like to me that's pretty cool. Those are amazing. They're amazing. And the one thing people underestimate about hunters is our respect for animals. I love him. Why did you kill? I freaking, I totally respect him. I love him, but I can tell you that other picture right there when you have that looking at you in the face. I mean I knew it was like freaking do or die and I, I literally looked at that thing and I said out loud, I said I'm going to shoot you in the F and face because you don't swear. Yeah, sorry. It's cute. And my boy might listen. Remember I drew back. Oh, like I literally drew back and I anchored and that came into my peep and means for people don't know. There's like a little circle that you look at through the string. We line lining up with the site. So I was literally lining up the shot, lining up the shot and as soon as I kind of brought my shot down to where that wolf was, there was nothing there. He bolted. No, I think he just like, yeah, like Ninja.

Speaker 1:          02:07:01       Well he if there that wise and that big in that old, they've got to know what they mean. Smart. We had to have known that you killed the elk and they had to have known that you killed those other two wolves which chased you.

Speaker 2:          02:07:13       That went after this to try and get the ELC. I think he came in to to think, okay, we've. You called a fight. We responded, now he's like sizing up. Okay, I've lost. Here's what I've lost. I want to know what I'm going against. He kinda came in and he freaking looked at all

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       and then that was it. Good thing they can count for you. Who you only had two hours left here. Yeah. Two hours. Two bullets. Bullets. That guy pick up and picked up. Three. It was bone chilling. I'm, I mean I have, you and I both have friends that are grizzlies cats. I mean, cats are notorious for stocking hunters too, because I mean they are the ultimate hunter, but grizzlies and wolves, I mean there you have to be on guard that, you know, there's places now we're, you know, grizzlies are strongly becoming such a problem when it comes to, you know, they have to be controlled. They're just starting to get to be too many for, especially for the food source. Well there's people that worry about them being wiped out and I read this article about it recently and it was just so filled with misunderstanding or misinformation and we're talking about wiping out grizzlies that if they did open up back to grizzlies, grizzlies back to hunting again, they will be wiped out.

Speaker 1:          02:08:35       People don't understand how it works. There's a lot meant a certain amount of tags that get distributed because wildlife biologist deemed that there's too many of them and then it's problematic for all the other animals that live in the area. You have to understand like when they try to do, when they put tag limits on white tail deer or would they put tag limits on wolves? They do it because they've deemed that there's an issue and there's obviously people want to hunt deer, but there's also an issue, like we were talking about the state of Pennsylvania. There's some areas, I don't know if it's still the case, but there were some areas in Pennsylvania where they brought in hunter's year round, no tag limits. They were like, just please come on down and shoot. And it was on Michael Waddell, uh, his show. Oh yeah. T bone was there.

Speaker 1:          02:09:22       There was a shot like three or four deer in a day and it was in the middle of summer. It's just went down there and shot deer because there's just so many of them. And they were shooting them in like a residential area. They were in a tree stand in like this dude's fucking yard. And it's overwhelmed with deers. I think I, I met a guy that was literally begging me to come. He said there's a deer season in the residential areas I think in New Jersey. And he said there's like so many deer in people's backyards and the timber. So he just said it's like there's just so many that they're issuing a lot of urban tags and they are wanting to. Yeah. And they have to. And they have. Did you see the bears fighting in far rockaway? New Jersey. Did you see that video?

Speaker 1:          02:10:05       Yeah, bring up that video to no bullshit. Bonafide seven foot 400 plus pound bear's going to war in a residential community. Knocking over fucking mailboxes and garbage cans. Roll it out into the street for flying. Biting each other. Look at the size of these fuckers. But are they there? Try to pet them or anything? Yeah, they should just be friends. But look at these guys going at it. These are big fucking bears too. Big Boars the size of these guys. And so we kind of move. Is that. What was the, what was that a judo? Throw his shitty Jujitsu. Looking at. He's reaching for a back leg. It's like more than the answer. Trying to ankle pick. It went in for a back leg. Well this goes on for a long time too. In the guy who's filming it is filming it from his car. I guess he's got his hand out the window and so they go crashing through the bushes. They go tumbling down to the street. They take out some mailboxes. I mean there's a mailbox. Good Dude. These fuckers are big man. They're big ass bears.

Speaker 2:          02:11:11       Those are really big

Speaker 1:          02:11:12       and they, they keep going back. See this one guy wants the garbage and that's where it is. Funny. Have a lady just came out to go shopping. Well I fucking easily could happen. That's how people die. Oh yeah. This is lady got killed in Florida last year by one of these fuckers.

Speaker 2:          02:11:27       Yeah, they're, they're serious. They mean, I mean, you're not bear barriers. What a lot of people don't realize too. I every year I go up, you know, you always catch, you catch flack for being a bear hunter. But I go up to British Columbia every year and bear hunt and during and it's all spot and stalk there. It's all fair chase. Um, but during the course of a six day hunt, I remember one year I saw 82 bears on a six day hunt. That's insane. I mean in some of the barriers you might see twice, but there was so many barriers and it's like, you know what, you have to manage that. It's healthy for them to. Otherwise this happens and you want to watch this in your yard.

Speaker 1:          02:12:13       Well, this is what could happen and what's interesting is Jamie and I, we were laughing because we found this fucking poster, this billboard that said they're all cecil and it's a bear and a lion hugging each other and it said, stop the New Jersey Bear Hunt. Like there are people out there that are emotionally wreck there. There are children there. They're an emotional wreck there. A child who doesn't understand that nature is a ruthless, vicious, beautiful, majestic thing and wildlife biologists were the ones who know the best you. You see these crazy emotional people that get so wrapped up in this idea that these things are. These animals are like people. They have this fucking picture of this bear and this lion hugging each other and the bear has tiers and the lion is tears. Look at this. They're hugging each other. It says they are a band. The bear hunt, they are all cecil saved, New Jersey bears.com. You guys were out of your fucking mind. Wow. These bears didn't exist. They didn't exist and they were in a movie. They would be a monster. Be some based living in the woods. That fucking eats eats baby deer right out of the vagina of the deer. When they pull them out and they literally catch a deer that's giving birth to a and they pull them

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       out of each other. They eat cubs on a regular basis. There's so much cannibalism and the bear community. It could be. I'm thinking, well, they equal rights. Tell me that fucking story that you were telling me yesterday about the grizzly bear that got into the shed or got into the cabin. Oh yeah, and just the sheer power. I actually have a. my, my like wilderness father, his name is burt. He's up up there where I hunt and BC. He has stories of the wilderness. He'd be the ultimate character for you to have on and he's like a real life. Grizzly Adams. He's got stories, but there was a bear that kept destroying the camps and the cabins. They ended up, they ended up like just kind of calling the bear earl big earl or something and they would come to the camps. He would come in and they would have like a huge big door, you know, and they would nail in, you know, nine, 10 inch spikes through the doorframe in three spots down the sides.

Speaker 2:          02:14:35       And then through the top they'd nail 10 inch spikes, pound them through the logs, have a log home to hold the doorframe in. Well, they came to camp and they figured, well this is going to keep him out because he was blowing through all the windows. Every year he'd blow through the windows, so they boarded the windows up and they had this door. So evidently he got mad. They could see where he was really mad about how they boarded the door, the windows up. So he literally grabbed the door and the whole door and we'll. The whole frame with the door was like freaking laying off to the side of the cabin with 10 inch spikes bent on 90 degree angles and there was one claw there. He had evidently reached in with two claws and freaking hook the backside of that doorframe and ripped a fricken door out of a log home and pulled one of his own closet and pulled his claw.

Speaker 2:          02:15:32       That's how they knew they got the bear because they ended up getting a permit to get the bear and he had nine clause. Wow. So he fricking through that to the side. When in the cabin he licked the fricken oven clean, but he could still smell that there's like Greece somewhere inside there that he like wanted to get to. So the whole fricken. The whole stove was smashed about this high off the ground, so a couple inches a couple inches off the ground. He literally just got on it and squish that fricking a fullblown stove just like we would a pop can under our foot to like squirt some extra grease up the side of that big Oreo cookie that he thought it was. Oh my and licked it clean, we'll it gets better. So there was curtains over the sink and the Cabinet and the curtains were all gone.

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       And, and um, the other thing too, I think there was like there was two big five gallon things of like cooking oil that were in the camp. So burt told me that there was like one claw mark in the cooking oil and then the fricken things like a Capri Sun, he had freaked out, popped a hole in these five gallon things, a cooking oil and freaking squirt them dry like a, like an old capri sun through those to the side we'll, the curtains were gone to because burt thinks because of cooking, like the grease and crap that got on the curtains. He liked freaking they were gone. Yeah. Well at the time they didn't know. They just, you know, I'm his wife Mary Jane was like, What happened to the curtains? And he's like I have no idea. But he had lived in there. So I mean he had like piled the couch up and I mean he like lived in that cabin.

Speaker 2:          02:17:22       Will there. The bear did a full blown 10 foot fricking grizzly mountain grizzly, so then they went down to the next camp which was 20 miles away and I didn't tell you this part, so they get in there and it's just an absolute freaking wreck. It looks like a life size mouse home, just crap everywhere. So Mary Jane's like cut a snow shovel and she's like scooping all this freaking shit off the ground and there was all these like material dingleberry's in and she's like, what are those dingleberry things? And burt goes, that's all the balls off the curtains from Griz camp the frick and buried like eight. The curtains in the other camp. Once he destroyed, he kept walking down the road 20 miles to the next brick and cabin. Destroyed that one and freaking shit. Only miles. Yeah. Oh yeah, he was, he was the king of the mountain. Oh yeah. They have a huge range, but yeah, he like, you know, fricking slung dingleberry juice and 10 gallons of fricking oil all across the next can. Just to prove a point might have been kind of diarrhea. Bear gets after 10 gallons of oil, just drink oil and eat curtains was probably about the same kind I get after like six chicken mcnuggets. It's hard out there for a bear to hard world. It is this a crazy animal.

Speaker 1:          02:18:47       It's such a majestic. We're super lucky that they're alive. We're super lucky that they're around. And that's the difference between, I think, um, people who were like really hardcore animal rights activists and people who are wildlife biologists and conservationists. They both agree that bears are amazing and that's where I think that these people are, they have a misconception. They think that hunter's want to kill animals and they're, they're vicious and they're mean and cruel and they have little dicks and uh, some of them do. I'm sure. I'm sure someone small for you if you admitted that well, like small, but you're a giant guy like six, five. It could be. That could be it. Maybe it's just small compared to everything else. I hope so. I hope so too for you. I mean, you got to admit your problem if you're going to move on, right?

Speaker 1:          02:19:38       So you get better at archery is how you get better at dealing with your Dick. But this but both. My point was that like both love bears. Oh yeah. They just, they just don't want them to be a problem. So when you're looking at what this bear did, that cabin you said Woo. Cam is in his name. Rude. So nothing's his neighborhood. How about that? I just said it that it's all. If people live out there and the bear comes in their house, it's not that the bear came into his own house, it's a fucking person's house. And if you don't think that way then you're, you're a problem. You're your problem. The bears are fucking bears. All right? And if you don't differentiate the difference between, uh, the value of a person and controlling populations of bear, well you're a ridiculous person. You, you, you're not looking at this thing correctly.

Speaker 1:          02:20:28       No one saying the bear should be wiped out. But when you talk about an animal that can, from a stove, flatness, stove and pull a door out of the frame with nine foot long spikes surround, I mean nine inch, nine inch, nine foot. How crazy that some kind of nails, nails, nails as big as the band, nine inch long spikes. You're talking about an insane animal that if you don't control their populations, they're going to decimate everything. They're gonna. They're gonna debt. The only thing that's saving them is them, them eating cubs. That's the only thing that controls the population of them. If they're not, if they're no. Huh?

Speaker 2:          02:21:03       Yeah. The only thing controlling the population is the food chain. And you know, I told you this the other day, I, I feel like as a hunter, I love what I've got to witness as a hunter because I feel like I've spent, I've spent way more time enjoying the creations of the wild because I've been out there

Speaker 1:          02:21:26       really out there. Yeah. I'm like, how else would you have gotten a chance to see wolves in that environment that you saw them? I mean, that's a confrontational.

Speaker 2:          02:21:34       Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I wouldn't prefer to be in the middle of a freaking wolf attack to see them, but you see things like I told you the time we're like, you know, we're the time were a freaking bull moose, like probably about the size of the one that you've got over there. You know, literally watched this fricking grizzly square off to this bull Moose and hit it. The grizzly literally just hit the fricken top back part of a full blown Mousse and just broke it. And it's like dinnertime snapped. It's back. Yes. Snapped it. I mean, just the sheer power. Yeah. Where was this up in BC. Wow. I mean, you look, how far away was it from you? It was a ways off. I mean, it was like a binocular watch, but still there's things like that. There's things like, you know, you talked about how um, the rivets up in Alberta where they have the bear camp, you know, you saw like a boar.

Speaker 2:          02:22:30       Maybe they were telling you the story I saw bore and the south fighting. Okay. Going at it. Yeah. Well, I've seen, and I told you this and I actually, I shot the bore, but I spotted a big bear and a field and I was hunting and it was spot and stalk and as I'm starting to stock all sudden the sow comes out and starts freaking like posture and to the, to the mail and then all heck broke loose just like that. That's what it was like. And I mean I'm within 100 yards of it. I mean it's ferociously loud. And then after they like break up, the board goes running to this huge. You've seen the timber up there, the timbers gigantic. Then a couple stories, high fricking jumps on this tree and starts going and I mean I'm talking like full speed, full speed.

Speaker 2:          02:23:23       I mean it's like if it's an incredible chase and fight, he freaking hits this tree and he's fricking going up at like bark is just ripping out and the, the black female is going right behind him. And at the time I still didn't realize what's up until I. until he gets almost to the top and I see two colored cubs up there and he's free, I mean like branches or coming off like nothing is stopping. This dude, he's fricking going and right before he gets to the cubs, the frick and female launches and grabs the ham hock and just let's go the tree and just fricking let's both of them and let's the weight frick and bring them down and just Ooh, you hear like boom. And then all heck breaks loose. They go up into the timber and it's just like, you know, a crazy fight.

Speaker 2:          02:24:20       We were in a similar situation when there was a mother with her cubs and then the board came in looking to kill and eat the cubs. Yep. Oh yeah. Yeah. And we talked about there's argument to why I haven't seen the evidence on, you know, you feel like it's just was Rinella said that there's recent evidence that shows that these bears are looking to eat these things like almost immediately when they come out of hibernate because of ease of riot. Yeah, because they're just food I've, I personally think because they always tend to be more aggressive on the cubs from what I've experienced the further into may then the rug, right? The closer you get to run, the more likely, you know, I kinda think those boards might have bred one or two styles. They're Horny, I mean so horny and then they, they're wanting another one and they know that's the only thing that's going to trigger to for them to come back in. But I, you know, after that fight broke up in the sow, she ended up standing guard. She kind of called her cubs down and they hauled will, that big bore ended up coming out and he was, you know, it was like a seven foot chocolate and that's the one I got, you know. So, you know, some people might be like, oh, he was trying to kill the babies and then you know, next thing you know, I got it. So I kind of feel like I did babies. You're constantly definitely conservationists in that

Speaker 1:          02:25:50       and that people also don't realize that you eat bears too. People have been eating bears forever and it tastes good. Yup. You know, they think the. You only eat deer and elk and everything else is trophy hunting, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:26:01       Yeah. It's, it's amazing. To me the, the, the, just the beauties that I've seen, I've been, I've been, I love sitting in a white tail stand and I spent a lot of time in a white tail stand just sitting quiet and you know, for me it's, it's like meditation because it is so quiet at times. There's like sometimes I've heard like birds and noises where I'm like, I've literally never ever hurt. Like what is that? Like I've never heard that. And I. One of the coolest things that I've experienced is I've been in the timber during the fall or there's just colors, like, like a painting, just colors, you know, you know how it is in the Midwest and there's days when like the first fall snap really happens when I believe trees just decided to let go. I did. Have you ever watched any of the Harry Potter movies you ever see that move? That tree that just like fricking cleans itself off and then all of a sudden he just decides, well, I've been in the timber where it was like the trees are almost communicating and everyone just said let go. And literally the like someone just moved a fresh canvas, just all the colors of fall just let go and you literally watched the whole color of fall go to the ground and it's bare

Speaker 1:          02:27:30       who can say they've seen that? Pretty rare. It is amazing to see these cycles of nature, the see them in person and I think that's one of the things that a lot of people are missing by living in cities. There's a lot of really cool shit that you could see out in the woods. There's so much. So much of it is just like inherently fascinating or like it appeals to us some sort of a primal way. You remember that Squirrel I sent you the other day? Yeah, I got.

Speaker 2:          02:27:59       Yeah, that was crazy. I mean, I was out for a little walk and I came across a really nice buck and awesome buck, literally dead and eaten by coyotes and it was a deer that I know was, you know, I'd seen earlier in the season and it was perfectly healthy and next thing I know a month later here it is dead. Just a decade carcass eaten. What do you think happened? You think the coyote is captured it? Are you tired from the Rut? It's hard to say. I think, you know, I think with any type of animal, especially when the males have such a limited time to breed, they've really exert themselves. I mean it's like, it's like looking. I've seen books that literally look like,

Speaker 2:          02:28:45       like that. You got that fighter that fought Kimbo or whatever, you know, $5,000. I literally seen them, I've seen them walking in there like a fricking fully skins Zombie just because they've just been running. They came too much. Yeah. Yeah. They don't look like that a few times I heard you get, you get, you get tired, man. Yeah. And I think when they get that run down, it's no different than me when I'm traveling a lot, especially when I'm skipping time zones and I really have a hard time getting into a sleep pattern and a recovery pattern. You just get sick, you get the flu, you know, you get the flu, you get some fricking stupid little bug that's on an airplane from some guy like three seats over that's coughing, you know, I think he just where your immune system down and you're vulnerable.

Speaker 2:          02:29:36       And then when winter comes in and it's, it's a fricking, you know, it's tough on. So they don't eat for days sometimes. Oh yeah. Days. I remember it after it. I saw a book one time. He was just, I mean I see him like as far as I could see with the binoculars over here. And then I, you know, 30 minutes later it seem as far as I could see with binoculars go through this creek bottom in this creek bottom. And I was actually sitting on this like Pond Dam and about 11 in the morning. Here he comes. He's just like, fricking, he's just walking with the Zombie walk, like he's trying to find a scent trail of a dough that's in estrus and he's just been breeding for weeks and I remember he was just freaking comment in any literally just comes running any hits the pond and he's sitting in the pond like with just as head sitting out and he's like, and then he comes up out and he's just like, he goes like shakes and he's gone again. It's just like, holy crap, this poor dude is just like running this like marathon of the Rut and well there's so much competition. Oh yes. Well that's part of what ramps them all up. This is so many other deer there. Yeah, yeah. I mean, and it's, you know, so to watch so many die that way. Well I found that, but that buck that day and then

Speaker 2:          02:31:09       two minutes later I'm walking through the forest like, oh, here's a cute little squirrel. You know, I see this girl like any, like Kinda like, he's like looking at me on side of this tree. Like, is this person going to hurt me? And all of a sudden like fricking boom, this like red tail hawk, just fricking pounds of this thing. And I'm like looking around like, what the heck? And then the Hawk looks at me and starts to fly and then drops a squirrel and I. and that's the. I went over and here's this girl with like to talent marks one through. It's either through its mouth and one like. Did you put that picture on? No, I can, I can send it to Jamie though if you put it on your instagram page because crazy picture. Yeah. It's a weird thing to see. Yeah, it's, you know, nature's nature is interesting, but it's, you know, I'm a conservationist.

Speaker 2:          02:32:01       I'm a, I'm a huge supporter to the boone and Crockett club. I've, you know, I've uh, you know, really tried to become, you know, I've, I've done what it takes to become a professional member now of the Boone and Crockett club and you know, I'm really focused on trying to give more back on the conservation side because there are so many important things that these organizations do for wildlife. As much as people want to say they, you know, I've, I've, I've just never seen an, an anti hunting community come anywhere where I'm at and put in time establishing habitat and actually doing things that grow the population and you know, I plant food and I probably leave 5,000 bucks a year worth of food in my dirt to like help grow deer and like help my dear,

Speaker 1:          02:33:01       don't, don't you think though that there's a lot of people that have opinions about, uh, about animals and about wildlife that really spend very little time with animals and in wildlife they have this very convenient idea. Like, like when I, I told a friend of mine the number, the more we discussed on the podcast earlier about Michigan having 50,000 car accidents a year and he was like, you're lying. I'm like, dude, Google it. And he looked at it and he just sat, like literally looked at his phone and sat like, plop down. Holy Shit. I go, you're not there. If you're there you would know like it's, it's overwhelming because his opinion or his point of view was that these hunters are just these people that are just assholes that liked to shoot animals, like they do need to do this, like they need to do this and you might not think it, but you just. No Way. You have a survey of the whole world or the whole country. You just don't. And if you did, I bet you'd have a different pace.

Speaker 2:          02:33:59       Have you seen some of the numbers, like what allstate insurance posts about how many vehicle deaths and like dollars and vehicle collisions are, are just with white tail deer with one insurance company? Let's find out. I have it on my laptop. If you want me to grab Jamie could pull it up. I'm sure it's on Google. It just google.

Speaker 1:          02:34:20       How many car accidents involve dear nationwide? Yup. I bet if Michigan has 50,000. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:34:28       mind blowing the even the number of deaths would is

Speaker 1:          02:34:33       well in campaigns is hometown. Some guy just died, some guy hit a deer and then the guy in front of them died because. Or the guy behind him, the guy hit a deer when flying through the air, 175 to 200 fatalities every year and 10,000 injuries. There's approximately one point 5 million deer related car accidents annually. I'm going to say that again. There are one point 5 million deer related car accidents annually. You didn't know that, did you? Nope. Over $1,000,000,000 in vehicle damage and 175 to 200 fate totalities as well as 10,000 injuries.

Speaker 2:          02:35:14       Oh my God. And

Speaker 1:          02:35:16       200 deaths in 2012, it said 200 deaths. $4,000,000,000

Speaker 2:          02:35:21       year. Yup. Fucking Christ. Exactly. And a lot of people don't know that the continent is large and that. You know what? Let me ask you this. It's funny. People, people whine and cry about how much insurance goes up. How much do you think it would go up if we didn't help that? Well also

Speaker 1:          02:35:43       does that have about health insurance? Because it ticks and lyme lyme disease.

Speaker 2:          02:35:47       Oh yeah. There was this end. Just your injuries. More people going in for hitting one. Yeah, absolutely. My Dad, my dad actually, he, he always wanted to have his teeth perfect and I remember he wore braces for a long time to get his teeth fixed and like no sooner than he had them done and was wearing a retainer and my dad's like, he's got a truck at home, like a big truck, but he never drives it because he always, he liked, drove a little bitty Honda and fricking hit a deer. He hit a buck like a month after getting like finally the dentist saying, you don't have to wear your retainer. He hit a buck. The horns stuck through his windshield and the horn stopped on a steering wheel and the body came in and hit him in the face. Oh my God. And he had to like get.

Speaker 2:          02:36:43       He literally is fake teeth in the front. Wow. Ha. So Jesus Christ. Yeah. I had no idea that one point $5 million I told you. That's crazy. That's a way better statistic. 50,000 in Michigan. Yeah. That's nothing. I mean, I mean, well wow, that's a lot. It's a lot. But in the, in the whole scheme of things, you know, my wife, my wife's from Rangeland, um, and she had never hunted her family, never have. I mean, they're just, they have no idea about that stuff. It's, you know, they, they have no relation to hunting. Right. So when she came over, she was, you know, she knew I hunted and she was open minded to it because I, I showed her numbers like this. I said, okay, I understand you don't understand it, so let's talk about some of this stuff. Do you realize this? Do you know that at our house if you drive around, you're gonna see a deer from your car, like almost anytime you're driving around our area after dark or waiting to see how many dead deer on the side of the road during the first three weeks in November, driving down the highway in Iowa.

Speaker 2:          02:37:58       You know what I mean? So she kept an open mind and she realized really quick. We couldn't grow a garden, you know, in Wisconsin, they were like eaten us all the time. I mean, they were everywhere and she's just like, you know what, I get it. I never saw this. I didn't see this much stuff in in England. We didn't have it. That's why we weren't hunting there. It's not because people aren't necessarily hunters. It wasn't in some areas it isn't a needed conservation. It is here. That's the reality.

Speaker 1:          02:38:34       Imagine if you could see all one point $5 million car accidents in like a scene one after the other. Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Because you've got to think there's three and 65 days. Use Twenty four days in a 24 hours in a day. So if you could look at all the footage that's accumulated every year in one giant loop, the highlight reel of car accidents, you couldn't watch it in a year. Well you couldn't. Well you would watch two people die. Two or 200 people die too, but just the sheer volume would kind of wake people up. If you could watch the sheer volume. If they put together a movie that was three hours long, that was just all the car accidents in the last six months with deere, people would go, oh my God, we're at war. We're at war, and they're attacking cars. They're literally suicide bombing cars to jumping out in the street and taking out drivers.

Speaker 2:          02:39:29       Well, for over three hours you would see someone die every minute. Yeah. In that compile.

Speaker 1:          02:39:35       Yeah. You just see boom, boom, boom, boom, smash hook to the face of antlers to the neck. It was over and over and over again.

Speaker 2:          02:39:42       You'd have a lot more candidates for that. LSD. A trial for. I mean there'd be some serious traumatic.

Speaker 1:          02:39:50       Sorry. Mgma. MGMA trial. Yeah. That would flip people over in the end. Listen, we gotta get the fuck out of here. It's 4:00. Oh yeah, you did the shoot and just we just bang through three hours. How about this buddy? Thanks Jamie. Thanks for coming down here and thank you very much for all the coaching, man.
