Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Dude, it seemed like we just did this. It does feel pretty recently. A year ago. I don't know. I don't know. It's already October. I'm scared. Let's just fuck and spark up a joint launch. One of them backwards. Now. One of these backwards. These are so good. Just smell it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       Just smell. Whoa. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:27       You know, everyone was commenting on your blunt rolling technique after the Elon Musk thing. Oh, I don't roll them. I know. They were like, and I knew that. They were like, oh, what does he. He just, he can barely roll a blunt. I was like, you're the professional in the world. It's a pretty real good bond. You can't read. That. Smells good. It smells so good. They taste good too. There's a. those are phenomenal. The I, I'm a blunt man. Yeah, I know. It's probably bad for your lungs, but there's something about the tobacco gets you a little high up and then the marijuana sort of like spreads you out and it puts you in like a new dimension. Yeah, that's, that's a good one. I'm going to get blitz grieved after Halloween. Kids, oh yeah. Imagine how high you'll get to after 30 days. Last year I did.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       I did comedy. I had no idea what I was talking about while I was on stage. I was like, oh my God, this 400 people in this room know what I'm saying. I always thought of bringing in all my marijuana and booze in here. Like, like why like it? Like in the old West when you have to turn in your guns and just dumping them on the table because I have so much marijuana. It's ridiculous. I know. It's crazy. I keep a stack of whiskey over there and then we've got another cabinet full in the back. Yeah, you could get fucked up hard for you here in this place. We're going to ripped on the back. Remember when we did the podcast on the day back. Those were, those were fun shit. Those clients so much more fun when he's high and grumpy when he's sober. I such a grouchy dog, like legit, angry, like he could joke around about anything when he's high, when he smokes weed, but then when he's not smoking weed, you're like, wait, wait, wait. Are you fucking serious? He gets upset. Do you remember when you texted the three of us? Who are you? I don't think you're doing the right classes. Do you remember? You think you're going to have to do them again?

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       Joking. I love you. He called you. He called you upset. Oh yeah. Yeah, he was upset. I don't remember if we texted or called, but I go, I love you. I'm just joking. I'm sure you do. The one thing about Arias, this is one thing that you could say after all the welding talking on the nonsense. Ari has rock solid ethics off. Yes, he does. Like if Ari says going to do something, he does it like so if I'm fucking with him and saying I don't think you're doing it like I don't really mean. Right, right. You're just kind of, you're poking at them. Right? So if you're out there already and you hear this molly fucking around, I know you're doing it. He can talk to you for the next 30 days.

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       Dangerous. He came back, he came to our class for that last one. He was so much easier than most clubs can believe. You questioned how hard my class one we didn't. Encino. Yes. He was like, this is so easy compared to what I've been doing in New York. Like it's all easy. If you go easy, I guess it's all how you do it. If you. If you do hot yoga and you go 100 percent every pose. Yeah. It's fucking hard to the matter who's teaching? Yeah, it's hard. But there's this guy that I go to a hundred percent. I have a drinking problem, legit drinking water. There's this guy that I go to yoga with a who is a. he's. It seems like he just doesn't ever go 100 percent. He started just kinda like, you know, you put your arms above your head. He always does this.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       He's never doing this research. Fully stretched to extend his palms net connected. When you do that, it's hard, right? If you just kind of half ass every pose and do this. Yeah, you can get through a 90 minute class. You're not doing the same thing as if you do. If you do any of you ever go to like a group training class somewhere you can see people and there's like a 63 year old lady who's doing a with. She's on her knees. She was like, this is hard, and talking at a normal rate, you're like, you're not. You're not doing it. Yeah. I got in trouble with my crossfit class because I was just getting pissed. I was throwing up everyday. I was throwing up every single day. I was also drinking a coffee right before it started, so it's throwing up coffee every single day and one day I just snapped.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       I go, Hey, the black guy's not doing his burpees. The black guy. That's what they said, Joe. That's what they said. We don't talk like that. It's got a name. I go in, I don't know it, but I'm pointing to him. He's not doing his burpees and then. And then the joke I made out of it was, hey, a Wendell, the gay guy says I can't call you the black guy but you're not doing. You're throwing it back to a cross fit. I liked the idea that we're doing this in general heart rate sense because you can sprinkle it in. I want to go to a spin class. And by the way that is how, if you want to like get a real bump in those points, it's about a bumping heart like sustained accelerated heart rate. So a spin class is gonna get you a bunch.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       You know what I mean? It's not like Joe, I don't know if you know that he's like a way better athlete than you, but it doesn't mean that we put pin in that. It doesn't mean the month to find me that he'll automatically beat us because he's in better physical condition. You can actually beat them if you're going to push it all the time. What is it in your brain that makes you do that? Because we just looked at your map and you burned a thousand calories. Is there some sort of. I talked to Pat McAfee one time, he said it's about exclusivity. It's about rape and murder. My head's filled with it. Stopping rapists and stop and murderers and killing child molesters. That's where. Think about killing bad people when you work out. That's what I do. When I get tired, I get tired. I think about like saving someone I care about. I think about stopping someone is trying to murder someone I love. That's what I think

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       about. I love your face. I'm not kidding. I think about my second wife. I think about protecting people I care about. Can you tell me one time you'll. If it's hard, you'll go a pretending someone is trying to kill me. Yeah. Yeah. So you're like pretending. Yeah. I really don't have words for that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       That's what you gotta do. Cause that's, that's what if you think about worst case scenario, you're tired and someone's trying to kill someone you care about and you don't have enough energy to stop them.

Speaker 4:          00:06:29       But do you think you learned that switch in? Like a type one is not talking window a crow a learned from martial arts? For sure. Yeah. Yeah, sure,

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       yeah, yeah, because that's the scariest place you could ever be. Like the scariest place that you could be is life and death. So like just putting yourself in. Oh, just want to lose weight. Okay, good. Yeah, that's good. But that's not. You're not going to save yourself like you got. You got to put yourself in like animalistic fury. That's how you gotta you gotta put yourself, you gotta to put yourself in this state of just 100 percent effort. I was pegged at 180 177 beats per minute for the last 35, 35 minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:07:13       That's really, it's got to do it. See that David Goggins guy had gotten my head with a. just embrace the suck. Yeah, I can. I can get there where I go and just like, like during the marathon I just go, this is where I'm going to be for the next five and a half hours. This is where I'm at and is what I'm doing and I can, I can wrap my head around that. I don't know if I can wrap my head around like I don't know, the explosive activity of it and going like, I'm going to save my family and then getting, but that might not work for you, but there still could be a different tactic that works for you. You know what I mean? Even like bat going that fucking hard to where your body is completely giving out. There's part of me that goes, hey man, what are we doing here?

Speaker 4:          00:07:51       You know, like when I'm working out, I go, it's really fucking hard. Well, you definitely have to protect your health, right? Like the last you want to be doing this and having a heart attack. That's my. That's always my fear is I go, easy buddy. Easy buddy is a good way to look at it, but I've been doing that kind of working out forever. That's how it worked out. Yeah, that's. You've always were crazy. Yeah, I go crazy. Have you ever thought about someone who like really disrespected you right before you lift? You know what I mean? Like that's all that happens online. You can't read that Shit because I've gone to like a moment where you're like, I wish I would have cracked that dude in the face. And then right before, right before I said no, I have not, and I know I'm definitely know what I want. I know who I'm thinking about. I'm going to try it. All right. Don't say any names. What does he rhyme with in order to like egg

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       to really get yourself into that place? You know, you don't have to think about something that's terrifying and negative, but to me that's like,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       that's the ultimate position that where you're going to need energy. This is so silly. That one. The best shape I've ever been in is when I met my wife. I was 186 pounds. I look at Jamie type in skinny burt. I've almost had a six pack repack and I had like side muscle, a little little oblique. I'm going for that this year. This month I'm going to. I'm going hard. This month I've, I've got, I said to Jamie, I made a deal with myself every day I'm going to do air squats and 50 pushups. I was going to do 100 look at skinny burt posing, but you are a fucking stud. There was when I was in spin class. Look how skinny her face is. Well, your sphere face was super skinny after last year. Sober October. That photo that you posted that you sent to us skinny face.

Speaker 4:          00:09:43       I'm going back. I'm going hard this month. I really am. And I'm gonna. Enjoy it. Last month, I think last time I did it was out of spite. I wanted to prove to everyone I could stop drinking. This month I'm going into it having not drank probably a third as much as last year, meaning like I've drank three quarters as much. Does that make sense? And so, um, but when I was in spend cost, we had bob from the biggest loser was our spin class teacher crunch. This is Bob the coach from the biggest loser contest. And I never watched that show. He was, he was amazing. His inspiration was so connect key connected to me so quickly. One time, it's right before Thanksgiving and I'm looking good. I'm going to go to a wedding, my buddy's wedding and I'm on on the bike, and he goes, all right, everyone out of the saddle is going to be on the saddles for two minutes and I'm like, fuck this, and then he says, you're going, whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:10:31       I felt like he was talking to me. He goes, you're going home for thanksgiving. You're going to see all the people in high school, all the people that didn't want to have sex with you. Do you want them to want to have sex with you this weekend? And I was like, yeah. He goes, that stay out of that fucking saddle standard, that saddle and earn your Thanksgiving dinner and go out to bars the night before and say, I won't fuck you on better than you and I'm just going to want them to fuck me. I want them to fuck me. I am that bombs. I think with the heart and the paint that connected with me, so that vanity of like, I want people to want me. Isn't that funny, man? That bike motivated so many comedians. Oh, you know, just being a loser in high school and I'll show you guys. I'll show you. There's people that take them, that takes them straight to their deathbed. They're still like, yeah, fucking Sarah is seventh grade. This is for her. Yeah. My motivation is I think of getting to the bottom of it is I want people to like me because I know. I know, but I think it's on. I do that in an unhealthy way. I think I was pretty good speaking with. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:11:34       You to liking my special is the best compliments I've gotten. You worked hard at it. Thank you very much. Everyone has secrets. I mean streaming right now, but Joe Rogan special drops tomorrow, tonight, tonight at midnight. I saw that dude that that trailer is one of the best trailers I've seen for a special in a long time. I worked hard at it. I hope people like it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Some people are gonna hate it, but that's normal. I worked at it as hard as anything I've ever worked on ever. For sure. This our. Yeah. Yeah. I fucking went hard on this one. Good feeling to go to get done with something. I did the best I could do. I did the best I could do for sure 100 percent. I couldn't have done any better because if I did any more. The only thing that you could say is maybe a little more time like maybe a month or two more time on some of the bits like, but you never know when that is, you know, it's like there's a, there's a, there's a sort of like a period where they're developing and then they mature and then they're solid and then you never know like are they done or zero like one more tagline that I'm missing here because you know how like it's always the case you film and then right after you're done you have a brand new tagline that makes the bit.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       It's like the next Saturday that mother Fucker, but next week I wrote that. Did that special the next week I'm in, I'm in Michigan doing some theater and uh, I have that Alexa bit about. I'm fucking Alexa talking back, talk to Alexa. Like I talked to women in whatever the bid is and the next week I write the bit we set a fleshlight attachment for Lexus. Are you shut up the way I want to. Fuck God damn it. Where the fuck was that? God Damn it. Mind doesn't open up. Your mind isn't open up all the way until it's like, it doesn't have any pressure. The pressure's gone and then you're like, oh, I can take it here. I can take it there. And you're like, I wish I could think like this before I record. But you can't. You know what's interesting is that we've talked about this the after the specials over, like I don't have any material and I don't have anything to think about.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       But you always find it like overtime and then before you know, like, wow, I got to do our. Yeah, it happens. It happens and it happens quicker the more you've done it. Yeah. Yeah. Because you know you can do it. That's one of the sad things about these guys. Like I was talking to a guy the other day, like how long you been doing comedy? And he's like seven years. I go, how much time do you have? He's like 20 minutes. Like, oh, that's fucking ruthlessly unacceptable. It's terrible. I go, you are lazy when you've been doing comedy for seven years, you have 20 minutes and out of those 20 minutes 10 you should throw away. Right? That's crazy. But that's what happened. But they're not doing it enough. You're not doing it enough. They don't get enough sets in this, you know, it's hard.

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       You do an open mics and when you're doing open mics, everyone's sucks. So you look like a hero if you have anything that's remotely humorous, but then you try that remotely humorous stuff and you do it on at the Ice House and people like, yeah, go on. Between you and you and you know you do this bullshit. They're used to doing an open mic night and people just not having it. So a real sets are so different than if you don't, if you don't get in front of real crowds and it's not, you know, it's not entirely up to you. Obviously when you're starting out, it's hard to get. What do you mean? What do you mean? Real crowds? Like a real show. A professional. Oh, like those shows an open mic, you know? That's why it's invaluable. Like even if you give somebody an opportunity to come on your show for them, like a, an up and comer, because they don't normally have real audiences perform in front of giant for them. It's a wake up call. Oh yeah. Then they're like, Holy Shit, this is a real show. People have expectations and they pay money. When you go to one of those open mic nights, people are just drunk and everyone's terrible. So you're just laughing at basically anything you can kill, but how bad they are.

Speaker 2:          00:15:10       People are just like slamming, made almost career out of that. Yeah. Peter Chen, who was a guy who is so bad. I, Chris Mcguire was auditioning for Mitzi and Peter. Mitzi thought it was funny because Mitzi was so hilarious. She thought it was funny that one of the worst comics in La don't pull his picture up, was hosting the open mic night. Really? Yeah. She thought it was funny and. But I knew that mcguire was going to have to audition for Mitzi, so I said fuck that. So I called up the store. I said, I'm hosting. I said, I'll host the open Mike Nights Jenelle styles to the open mic night, just just to keep him from hosting it. That's great. So you did that like as a save for your buddy? Yeah, yeah, because I knew he was gonna you know, this would be too much to address and you have three minutes. That'd be too much. Too much chaos to address.

Speaker 5:          00:16:05       I hosted a show as a favor one time and ended up snapping on a lady in the yachting and ruined the show and they were like, thanks. Why did you a dude? Because I arrived, it was a showcase for Montreal and I arrived at the show before it. Right. So there's like a 7:00 thing and then the 9:00 showcase and they asked me to to host it and the and a lady at the 7:00 show at the earlier show is in like the front row just yelling out drunk. And she's older and she's like, yeah, like tagging every comics thing, commenting on it. And I'm like, Oh, I'm just so irritated. I'm like, well at least you know, the show's almost over. So the show ends, you know, people leave, we're getting ready to our second show. I look, she stayed in her seat and I was like, you gotta be kidding me. So second show starts and I'm already, you're primed. You know, like if you watch something that gets you agitated and then you're like, yeah, you're overreacting because you're like, you're primed for it. So like it started and it was like I said like my first joke and she said, I go, you fucking cunt.

Speaker 6:          00:17:12       Shut up. So people in the audience like don't talk to her like that. And I'm like, you don't know what she's doing. So. And then it just went really like given up for this guy wants to go to Montreal. It was terrible. It was terrible. Oh No.

Speaker 5:          00:17:35       But then she ended up leaving. Her friend came back in and while I'm onstage goes, did you call her a cunt? Like in the show? And I go, yeah, she goes, that's my friend. And I go within your control.

Speaker 6:          00:17:49       She leaves

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       and her son comes back, her son comes home to me,

Speaker 5:          00:17:54       talk to you for a second. And I was like, alright. And it looks serious too. And he was like, you call my mom a cunt when I go, which one is she? This lady over here. So I go outside and I talked to basically the lady who was the friend, should I go? She goes, what is going on? What go? Your friend has been disrupting, yelling out people, drunk, belligerent. She goes, you call her this, you call me that. And I go, all right, well I'm sorry I called you that, but I'm not sorry. I called your friend that she is what she is. And she's like, you can be a nice person. I see it in you. I was like, I was like, yeah, I go get your friend out of here. No one wants her here. Okay. And she was like, okay. And then her son was like, thank you. That was very disrespectful to my mother and I was like, okay man, we're good. I got to go back and host this disaster that. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       Oh, it was such a train wreck. Well, some people just think that if you're saying something they disagree with, they don't think that they need to just like wait it out. They think they can stop you in the middle. For me in particular, a lot of my bits start off one way. Like they look like they're going to be way more outrageous than they are and then I turn them around. Sure. But when I'm starting it off and then you, you just attack, like, like you're fucking up the bit, you know, you don't even understand what I'm doing.

Speaker 4:          00:19:21       It's the whole thing about freedom of speech in a weird way. I had a joke about pedophilia and I just started it. And the woman, this woman who was a fan of mine and everything, she just goes, no stop. And then now it looks like I'm probing Ophelia. I haven't gotten to the fucking punchline. Just looks like I'm in the fucking kids because they will a lot to finish it.

Speaker 5:          00:19:39       No, those people shouldn't be allowed at shows because they're not even letting. They're not even letting the art form take place. You can't. You crafted something. You don't let it play out. You can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       I mean you just, they should just kick you out. You just like, you're fucking up the whole experience for the whole crowd because like a guy like Brian holtzman would literally never be able to perform if the audience is filled with people like that. So people like you and I who enjoyed them, we would never be able to see him because his whole act is saying outrageous shit like that. That absolutely he doesn't really mean. Right? But the funny thing is the twists and the turns, right? And you to laugh at. The other funny thing is, is that he supposed to act like he does mean it. That's what's fun like that. People are like, always like, you know, they get super upset about this thing and it's like he said this and they're like, yeah, but don't you get that? It's, it's the performance. I used to have this joke about the second coming project.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       Do you know what the second coming project is? When they first started fucking around with genes and cloning, they um, there was a group of radical Christians that had this idea. I think it might've, it might've been bullshit eventually, but what their idea was they were going to take some genetic material from the shroud of Turin and they were going to clone Jesus. And so my bit was, what if you clone Jesus and it doesn't come out good. Like, you know, they had to do Dolly the sheep like 30 times until they got it right. Like what if, what if you would, if you cloned Jesus and he comes back handicapped and I had this whole fucked up thing about them following around this handicap Jesus. Instead of turning water into wine, it turns like dog shit into the cookies. And so this fucking lady, this lady goes next subject and she's sitting in the, in the, in the front row.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       So I did the bit to her. I looked her in the eyes and I kept doing it, you know, by the power of Christ compel you and doing it was a horrible pit, you know, it's like we're talking like 1998 or some shit like that. Right? So it was clunky anyway. But uh, she's literally saying next subject, which is, I'm never gonna Never gonna listen to you. Like what? That's like when you tell someone, shut the fuck up. Why would they shut the fuck up? Nobody that doesn't work. Nobody. Nobody. You want them to shut the fuck up. But you have no understanding of the power of persuasion or the fact that other people aren't you. Like you're not in control of other people. So if you tell someone, shut the fuck up, like, that doesn't work. This is just a poor way of you understand, you don't understand human beings like you haven't thought this through.

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       You just know what you want your selfish little head. And so you say it to them, this is how most arguments in most fights get started because people don't take into consideration at all the fact that they're communicating with another human being has their own set of emotions, their own life, their own problems, their own ego. It's true. There's a sure fire away any comedy show to hear more of the same topic because they'd be like, next, next subject. Yeah. That's a. and that's what I. I almost sometimes I preface it where I go, hey, you got like if you don't like what I'm about to say because I have a couple of things now that are a little too far. I could just talk to me after the show. Don't, don't even do that. Just don't interrupt things. I've got 500 people change my mind on it.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Like I had a bit that worked on the buy podcast very well. And then I've tried it in the club and this black chick came up to me and she's like, it's a really fucked up joke that was like really super racist or something. Was it super, super racist? Like the black guy at crossfit racist or I think it might've been worse. Really. I don't know. I don't know. It didn't bother me. But by the black chick in DC was like, I love the show all of it. I just think this is a year ago and I was like, a part of me is like a. is it a bit that's in the special then? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And so I, and,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and it's, it's like it's all, it's almost like I didn't want to, I wanted to tell it but I could figure it out to work it out, but I didn't wanna have to deal with all the fucking steps, all the steps. And I was like, I'm like, I'm not going to die on the hill right when I don't, I don't really talk about race much in my act. So I'm like, I don't really, I'm not going to die on that hill for that bit to do with a bit like that. You gotta look at it as if you're someone trying to deconstruct it. Like you're someone who's trying to attack that bit. See for me a bit works best the very first time I do it and then and then every, every, every work in bid I do around that to like take it apart and figure out another way to approach it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:23       That's where I start fucking it up. It's like the first time I say it I go, Ooh, let's hope we can find that again. That's I'm the polar opposite. Oh No. Occasionally I'll say something good the first time, but most of the time when I say something that seems like a sprout or a seed and then I'm like, okay, but how much time do you spend listening to recordings? A lot. A lot. Now I look back to that last special. I did it obsessive Lee and then I got into it. I got into recording and now what I do is I will bid out if I don't have video like that video because I think the video aspect really lets me know why things were like I this bit where I, my I do my eyes a little different and it was killing and I saw it on video and Oh, I gotta make sure to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:25:04       But um, I, for me it's like I, it's almost like I'm always trying to chase to get back to that first time I told it that feeling. Yeah. I like to clip it out and then put chunks of like, all right, here's where the starbucks bid is, here's this is. And then look at the different ones and go, oh, why did that work better than this one? But um, but I'm also, I've gotten really into editing videos and stuff so it's a lot easier for me than it was when I first started. Now I'm just like, oh, real quick, sync up audio and [inaudible]. I'll do audio and video, different tracks. Sync them up and then just clip them out, put them in folders. Audio and video. What do you mean? What I do? I got a little nerdy about it. I take a h, four, six and eight.

Speaker 4:          00:25:43       Is that an audio recorder? It's A. It's a zoom recording. Zoom h were six and then I'll take my camera, put it in the back if I can or I'll have the club run, run video, but I'd like to sync up clean audio and clean video. That way if I do have something fun, like Hannibal got on stage with me the other night and I was like, oh cool. I got all this shit that's. I could definitely put online if I'm going to want to do that. The Hannibal, I'd have to run it by him first, but I got real clean audio of it. Oh that's interesting. So you are doing it through the soundboard? No, I do it through the h four slash six is like the best and I have a basically a surround sound mic on that. Which ones are called the gun?

Speaker 4:          00:26:17       What? H four slash six. It's bigger than a zoom h four slash six. Right. Am I right on that or is it just the eight? Six? I would say the h six. It's a six. Eight, six. The other ones, the h four n zoom, zoom h six o them. Yeah. Audio recorder and it was big. Is that thing? It's about the size of. It's about the size of this box, but they make a zoo, it looks like. Yeah. They make a zoom that's smaller that I take with me now. That fits in my pocket, like the size of a lighter. That's really great. Yeah. Pull that up.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       Let me see what that looks like. What I like about doing it on my phone though is that I have them always with me all the time and then I sync it up in my car on the way to the Gig. That's what I did the other night to listen on the way there on the way out. You go like that because I liked the. I liked the puzzle solving aspect of putting together sets. You know what I mean? When you go like a man, like why does this, when I do it fourth it kills, but if I do it fifth, it's garbage. You know, like you try to like figure it out. Well maybe this needs to be punched up. Maybe they should move here. I liked doing that. I like figuring that out. Yeah. And there's always those mystery punchlines that you didn't think were going to be a punchline and crushes. Sure. You know, like what the fuck is, what are you laughing at? I don't get it. Like what happened there

Speaker 4:          00:27:29       due to the time that you guys were in the back of the room and I said I used to think and Helen Keller the same person and I didn't think that was funny at all. And you're like please don't do that a bit. And I was like, no, that was at a stand up on the spot, on the spot. I send them all the spots of the most useful thing. Yeah. Super. Okay. So which one is, you've got the h six. I've got the H, four n and then the h one n is the one that got that take with me. The h six is the larger one. That's like a Taser looking thing and then which is the one you take with you the one. And that's really little. What's the comparison in the sound between the h one, N and h six. A big jump in my opinion.

Speaker 2:          00:28:03       Yeah. Yeah. Jamie should be the same. How? So? Uh, I would, it would be, it should be the same microphones. Uh, the age six is just going to lie to do six tracks. That's what the six is logistics inputs. This was probably just one track or maybe it's too specific for this left and right. That's why there's two microphones.

Speaker 4:          00:28:20       Oh, interesting. That was a great mind. I take that with me and you, it shows you how much time you have. You put a 64 gigabyte, a mini SD card in and you get like 118 hours of recording. How's the. So if you do, I go through batteries pretty quick, but if you use lithium batteries, it's not that bad. So you do mini

Speaker 2:          00:28:38       sd card, you could take that mini SD card and put it if you have a phone. Like I just got an android phone, I got this, a galaxy note nine and it has a, it takes up to one terabyte of storage shit. Look at the stars. Is that new? But it takes an SD card. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. It takes an SD card. It takes up to one terabyte of storage. Um, it's fucking phenomenal. Just phenomenal. They used to be that they were like way inferior to iphones. It's not the case anymore. In fact, I think like, look how big that screen is. Yeah, that's great. Cup. Ready? Ready. Who makes that a Samsung? Let's see. Um, the, the fingerprint reader is fucking instant. And it as a pen we could write on the lock screen. So on the lock screen you can take notes and write on the screen. I haven't written in my job fully and forever. I feel like. Whoa. You sure can. And then you save those two you notes. But yeah, that's really cool. And then this also works as a remote control. So if you're playing music, if you play music on this thing while you're playing music, this will start and stop your music.

Speaker 2:          00:29:57       It's fucking funny. I'm just going to stomp out your iphone right now. I don't know man. I'm trying to figure out what to do. I've always had that same phone. No, but the other thing about the new iphone that Jamie was telling me is that you can um, you can have two different phone numbers. Were you telling me that? No, Brian was, you could have two different phone numbers and then one. Yeah, you can tell you what it tastes like a second card. So say like if you have a business line and online, right? Then he'd take that Sim card out for the business line or you disabled the business line and you're like fuck you. So say like if you have a phone that only like your best friends your wife have. And then the next is like agents, that other bullshit. Yeah. But you just set up a whole decoy number for like people. You don't want to have your number, that's good. But you can also do something like that with, um, what is that thing? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       here's a

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       google voice, right? Doesn't google voice have some shit like that. You can have a separate, that's that. You can have that rerouted to your phone number and have like a business line

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       kind of thing. We'll look at this. This thing works as remote control. So check this out. I'll crank it up. You take pictures with it too, right? Yep. Got It.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       So you're using that. Can Watch it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       See that? Oppress it. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:31:20       Box Cutter. Patsy, come on.

Speaker 2:          00:31:24       How many of those pens do you get? Like 10. No sticks. Right in your book. Fits in there. Bank. That's perfect at charges. It's Bluetooth. Nice. Syncs up to your phone. Maybe I'll get one of those guys a burner phone. Well, it's thousand dollars. You wouldn't really want it as a burner phone. Iphone. Yeah. I'm leaning towards it as my main phone. I really am. I mean, I'm going to say the thing about the walled garden of iphones is you just get used to that ecosystem. Right now. My, my zone is all on my iphone. This thing is still sweaty. Touch it if you want to get my sweat. Yeah, we don't want to drink something to see if I get that murdered sweat. And inside me, you just got to think like that. Just good thing coming after someone you love. So wait, let's, let's talk about um, so for the month and for me, he's going to think of that in itself. Just going to think of that. Think of rage. I got, I think a killing coyotes with my bare hands, I think of, I think all kinds of crazy. She'll tell you what I'm going to. I'm not even fucking around. I'm going to find my inner voice that speaks to me when I need that exclusivity. Find your dark place.

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       That's easy access for me man.

Speaker 3:          00:32:43       So someone said, uh, why is it so, why is it so difficult to tom for Tom Sober October? Um, he should take time off of thinking about murdering Baristas. Have you guys don't know him and his wife had been doing this thing where you guys had like, if you murdered somebody, which turned me into the cops. She was like 100 percent and I was like, are you out of your fucking mind? She goes, well, was it an accident? I'm like, no, I just told you that I killed somebody and I got the body in the trunk and no one knows. She's like, you're a psycho. I don't know what you're going to do. You're going to kill me next. I'm like, why would it kill you next? She's like, why'd you kill this guy? I'm like, because he pissed me off. It's like, it's like killed somebody today.

Speaker 3:          00:33:25       I get, yeah, that lady of content, right? So like got out of hand, shouldn't have to go to jail forever. You're my fucking ace, right? You're not going to turn me in. She's like, oh no, you're unpredictable. You can just ride or die. That's what I thought. Don't worry my ride or die. You call me if you kill someone and got the shovel ready to take it to the next level. If you come over with a body in the trunk and you go, I got a body in the trunk, I get the shovel and you come out and the body starts to get up out of the trunk. I'll hit him with a shovel, make sure he's dead. WHATSAPP did. Yeah, that was a close call. Where are we going? We're going to go do lot, much fun. We'd have figuring out a place to go bury a body.

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       Yeah, that'd be hard, right? Yeah. I can tell you guys, this is a conversation I wanted with her and why wouldn't she do this with him? And she's like, I got babies now. I fucking like, all right. Whatever. Anyways, I was just telling her, she's like, why did you kill the guy? I was like, alright, let's just hypothetically say that on the ride of the desert called you a cunt so I to kill him. I killed. The guy called me. I told her that he fucked up my coffee cup. That's definitely excusable. She said, she said if it's somebody like hurt the family or something, she was like, then it's 100 percent. She goes, but if you're like laying in, wait, just like premeditated hanging out like stalking people. She goes, Dad, I got to turn you in. And I'm like, I still think that's bullshit. Like you're my wife. Why the fuck are you reading on me? My wife would do the killing for me. Someone broke into our house, no questions asked. I already know your wife had gun. Somebody didn't give her the gun and your wife, you think you tell her she, she, she'd be like, alright, you gotta go handle this. I knew it was coming.

Speaker 3:          00:34:59       All guys prepping for this, as long as you're nice to the kids, they go, oh yeah man. It's what's crazy is that used to be super normal to kill people. Like you mean like in the human history? Oh yeah. Two hundred years ago. Yeah, super normal people. We have a president that killed somebody or. Yeah, yeah, it would be. Imagine like, um, how normal though, where it would be like, it wouldn't even be worth bringing up that you killed somebody that day. Right? I mean, if you go back far enough, it's like, yeah, people are just stabbed and wait, wait, there's there's battles on. Do you think they had their me too movement of, of going like

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       killing people. When did people just like totally stopped killing people? I don't know how to be a movement where pure like, guys, my dad was murdered and no one cares and your dad was murdered, so can I kind of hurt me to hear this fucking sucks man. To like the dark ages like coming out of that. Oh No, no, no. Dark Ages where you had no free will. When I watch when that game of thrones, when they cut his dick off and game of thrones, it kicked, clicked with a part of me where I went, I helplessness. The idea that you can't go, this isn't fair. You're not allowed to do that. That helplessness. It gave me a panic attack. Think about that. When you're on the treadmill, son them cut my dick off. Or You go cutting anybody's Dick. Oh, let's think of that feeling.

Speaker 4:          00:36:16       Just think of those kinds of people out there like helplessness. You're tired. You can't get away. They, when they bound, I watched, uh, I watched the Marco Polo and thing and when they bound that little girl's feet. Is that, uh, the Netflix? Yeah, it was great. I didn't watch that. I watched like one or two episodes. It seemed okay. It was great and good. Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, I like history. I like anything history. That's why I like, like I used to have on Dan Dan Carlin history and so Marco Polo really new Kangaskhan apparently. Yeah. And so I think he knew gangas con son. I think it's cooler. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like history. I'm not a stickler for details. So. Well, the cons, you know, the rain was a long time. I mean they, they, during [inaudible] lifetime, they estimated that he killed in his people killed 10 percent of the world's population.

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       God, they killed so many people that change the carbon footprint of the world. They literally change how many people were burning things. They literally changed it in core samples. Like when you do a core sample on the earth, the carbon footprint of human beings is less while he was alive because he killed one out of 10 human beings that lived. So he was eco. It was eco friendly for what he did. Yes. It's very greasy shit. That's a weird thing that Dan Carlin goes over and his wrath of the con series, which is like one of the greatest hits history series of all time. Oh, I can't recommend it enough. I wish I could go back to the day I found it and I was like seven part series or whatever and I'd play it laying in bed, fall asleep, wake up and have to go find out where I left off.

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       So good and I'd have dreams of being a con. I remember having a dream of learning how to shoot a of a page and in there we had to wait for all four hooves off the ground. I had a dream because I was listening to it sleeping. Dude. I had the most fun. I'm sorry. Keep going. No, go ahead. I had the most active. What was it? When you dream in your wake, lucid I the most lucid fucking dream. Last Night Vale most lucid dream. I walked into this closet and I was. I was on all fours and I go, I'm not awake. I think I'm dreaming. And I went, I am dreaming. I said, interesting. And I sat criss cross applesauce. I said, I want a beautiful woman to walk in the closet and a beautiful woman walked into the closet and I'm like, I think I'm gonna. Go down on her. And I was like, yeah, this is a dream. There's no cheating. My wife's in Vietnam, let's go down on her. I started going down on her and I was like,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       where's this leading? I think I'm going to fuck her. Fuck her. And then I was like, oh yeah, we're fucking her. And then I woke up. I'm like, God damn it. I, I wanted to stay back in it. She didn't want to read the fucking biggest glitch. Like a big black Dick. He gets stuck in your throat. I almost drowned. What were you saying about the Dan Carlin saying? I don't remember. Sorry. It's okay. Now you're going to access your rage from, from, uh, you know, from one of those moments. Yeah. Access. You're raised thinking about how you couldn't fuck her and you sucked her. Dick does a lot of rage. Super upsetting. Yeah. I mean, I used to do little tricks like that to get myself to work out harder. That's why, uh, that's why I have those in my head. That was like when I, you know, I just used to always feel like if, if, if the worst case scenario happened and you needed energy, like how tired are you really?

Speaker 3:          00:39:39       Are you really tired? Are you tired? Like, oh, I'm tired. I just need to stop. Or are you tired? Like, I can't survive right now? Or are you tired? Like, someone I loved dearly is in trouble and I can't help them. Like, how tired are you? Hmm. Yeah. That's. Think of that different levels of tired for sure. Yeah. I'm going to put those things up everyday. Motherfucker. You're going to see those images of these workouts every day and I'm doing two a day. You're going to work. Do a day like that. Yeah. Me Too, I already did mine today. I walked three miles. I'm going to do on that bullshit fucking treadmill that we were talking about. These stumps treadmill. You don't like that dude. It just is not enjoyable because it's hard. It's hard as weight. So that's the whole idea behind. It's difficult to keep going for point total, right?

Speaker 3:          00:40:23       Is that, that's the move, right? Well, I mean there was, there was two, like what are the other things? The initial thought I had was like last year we had a, it was 15 slash 20 minute hot yoga classes, so the idea was I'm going to do those too. Okay. Well the idea for that was that it was difficult but attainable. Right. And you had to be disciplined to do it. So now you're going to do two workouts a day. Yup. And 15 minutes. 15 million account. The Yoga is one. That's the one. Okay. I'll work out today. But. And then another hardcore. I'm doing the 15 hot yoga classes on top of all the other shit. What is this number? The one that's your calories burned. Oh really? That's what I said. When you walked in, I've never once been burned a thousand calories to workout, so I take that bunch. Yeah, there's a lot. What's a normal workout burn? I mean, if you're doing an intense one. Oh, here. I'll show you. I got a bunch of them locked in here. It says 98 percent of my secondary job. It's going to adjust. Yeah, because it's one 75. Yeah, it's going to drink is because I'm an old fuck. It just thinks my heart rate doesn't go that high anymore. Here I'm on. The juice numbers starts to says like it's 2:20

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       minus your age is your Max heart rate zone or something like that. Well that's not real. So yeah, the older you are, the lower your Max's. Well that's broken. The Shit don't work, right? I should be dead. This is where it should be. I don't think that's like the year or. I did a workout a couple of days ago. Sixty three minutes. Seventy two percent effort throughout. Eight hundred 64 calories burned. That's a lot. Eight hundred says yeah, that's a good workout. Yeah. And then this one, that was 62 minute workouts. I would you said? Yeah, this was a 93 minute workout. I burned 1300 calories. And a real. Yeah, you could do that. You can do that, but you'd have to go hog hole hall. This was kickboxing. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. You did a 90 minute kickbox we did kickboxing for part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:19       And then you've got a trainer now? Yeah. Oh, could you let Mr Tommy money bags a couple of netflix specials. Sell out a few theaters. He's not saying he's doing more than the no theaters. Presold sale. Sold out everything out. Everything. When you move into arenas. Hey, speaking of arenas, how was Toronto fucking insane? What is it like in the. When you're doing 10,000 people, 10,000, 600 people at the Scotia Bank or he was the Air Canada Center at the UFC is back there in December. I'm back. They're easy to be like, oh, one time I was here alone talking. And then you see it like filled for events like that. And that's where the fucking raptors play it. It's, it's so ridiculous. It doesn't seem real, but I got to say the show felt like as intimate as a set at the store, I'm not bullshitting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, it was fucking nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:43:14       So yeah. Yeah, it was fucking easy peasy. It was fun. I mean it was literally like any other set I was. I was nervous that I wasn't nervous. I was nervous that I was calm and I did a lot of sets leading up to it. Like when I did a, you know, I constantly do sets, but I did like, I did four sets Thursday night. Ideally. Yeah, I did the ice house Wednesday, so I did an hour plus the ice house. I did three sets on, on Tuesday night. Yeah, I mean that's. I think that's the key is you just gotta do gotta be. Yeah. You have to just do so many that you're, you're just just like working out. You can't have any doubt. You gotta be in shape. I just sent you a video. This is, this shows you how ridiculous the crowd booked, but when you're a, but you're also getting used to arenas because you did a few now just weird boozer fourth, Rena, fourth, maybe fifth.

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       But did, did. Um, Columbus Vancouver. Did Columbus. Did Kansas City. Kansas City was weird because outside. That was weird. It was like an amphitheater, right? Yeah. Crazy. This was the biggest one. This one was bananas. Wild Man. I'm stressing top of are doing tours at the exact same time next year and I'm stressing doing theaters 12. So $1,200 in the theater going like, fuck it. How do you like it gets normal man after awhile. But scooter scooter had dessert a couple of seconds and you can see it when I get onstage, like, like, like watch when they turn the lights on, this is what's really strange

Speaker 6:          00:44:50       when you get to look out over the entire audience. Fucking ridiculous. That's madness. That is that wild man do that. Then there's the upper deck that doesn't seem real and it just happened. And you, you did this and the same night a

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       bird did the forum burdens. Not 20,000, 9,000, the Western Forum, the Great Western Forum. I don't know that it is the thing online that it was 20,000 people. They're wrong because Dean del Ray said it was 9,000. I think they just made a mistake but huge. Either way. It's huge. So I was thinking last night, I know you, I know that you're not like this, I know you're a little bit like this, but to compare different times of comedy, right? Um, and compare people. I know you don't like comparing people, but has there ever been a time in comedy where this many acts were selling arenas? This many acts were selling theaters and this maniacs we're selling out clubs. I don't think so. He will. Well, burrs sold out Madison Square Garden, which is way bigger than that. Madison Square Garden I think is $18,000. How about this? Sebastian is ready to sell for car.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       He's already sold out three. He's opened up a fourth show at Madison Square Garden. Just stop and think about that. That's almost 80,000 people. That's crazy. Yeah. That's like a fucking nfl game stadium at this time. Like just look at theater comics. Just legit selling like multiple theater shows. Eliza Dalea. You can name any of you myself, like, Oh, you go down the list. There's so many comics selling theaters, theaters that I don't think there's ever been, you know, there's never been a time like this. Never. There's never been this many comics are settling out multiple thousand seat places. And then there's the big first of all this Kevin Hart, who's the biggest of the big. He sells out 50,000. Carol Williams is actually a lot bigger than he is. Kat Williams. Oh yeah. I watched it on the breakfast club.

Speaker 2:          00:46:50       I'm joking. I'm joking. Didn't he got Williams? Just slamming potential. Pretty Fun. I liked that. I liked, I liked tattoos, but he's, he's eccentric at best. Kevin is the biggest, the biggest. It's the biggest monster. So he's fit. He can sell 50,000. He sold $50,000. Philadelphia when he did a special. Yeah, there's only one of him, but you know, it was real close to him that people forget about is Larry the cable guy? Because Larry, the cable guy was selling out football stadiums because Josh Wolfe was opening for him and Josh Wolfe took a picture and showed it to me and he goes, dude, this was me onstage opening up for Larry the cable guy. And you're like, yeah, yeah, but people don't think about. First of all, Larry, the cable guy is the most humble. Like plus he's doing that in like the heartland. So people will just dismiss it because it's not like an la show or so.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       Those two guys, I think. I think Kevin Hart is Numero Uno. He's number one. Yeah. And then there's Chappelle could basically do anything. He sells out mass the forum, not the form of the Hollywood bowl. A bowl. Yeah. Yeah. That's huge. What does that $20,000, $20,000 is amphitheatre offers like left and right. And then they'll, you know, they'll probably be like, Eh, you do a show. It's like you'll get like $700,000, be like, I'm going to do the belly room. And then he just goes and does that because he likes it. He likes the intimate shows. Well, he's also, I hate to use a term like this, but he's a legitimate artist. He's just trying to do better work to better comedy and always evolve it. He's one of the rare guys that could do a special and then the next week 11 new our. Yeah, and somehow it comes out works.

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       I know. I mean he's just supremely dedicated, you know? Yeah. So there's him, there's Chris Rock can still sell out pretty big places. If Louis came back, I think he could sell out giant places. Giant burst sells out everywhere he wants to burke and sell out. He sold out Boston Garden, which is 18,000 wells fargo center in Philly. How big is that? 15,000. Yeah, that's crazy. He could sell out all those places. It's really hard to put in perspective, and I think you guys can understand this, but I mean you were selling out clubs what, like six, 17 years ago. Were you just doing clubs? Yeah, for sure, but when you were, when you were selling them, when you were selling out just clubs, that's an achievement in this business to sell out weekends and ad shows is a login achievement that so undermined when you go in and use San Jose or you do whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       You sell out everything and then go, oh my God, like Holy Shit. Like there's, there's. So the possibilities are endless. Well, it's the Internet. It's, that's what it is. It's people. And then there's like this network of comics now that everybody knows about, you know, if you know about bill, you know about Joey Diaz, you know about you, you know, but there's this thing going on now where everyone's sort of connected that's never existed before. And then a lot of these people, not Sebastian, he's one of the rare ones that doesn't. But most of these people have podcasts. Kevin Hart doesn't obviously, but Kevin Hart has major movies. Sebastian actually does one. He does a podcast. I didn't even know, but I don't think they, I don't think he can get to it like weekly, but they definitely considered serious thinking to do it specifically for serious. Does it? Whenever you can get to it. Think so. I think you've probably been, you've been in this longest of the three of us, but have you ever known a time in comedy when comics were more friendly? Like it seems like everyone's on the same team. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This is a completely different thing. I've talked about this before. It's because I really believe it's because the internet and also because there's

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       no, um, things were fighting for anymore. Like tonight show spots are stupid shit like that or Sitcom auditions. But in the past it was like there was three channels and there was the tonight show and the letterman show and everybody wanted to host the tonight show, but Jay Leno was hosting it forever or Johnny Carson before him and there was this competition between comics when they were just cut throat and there's not that anymore now instead, like radio shows, right? Radio shows always shit on the other radio shows always. They always saw other morning shows in town. They shit on him. It was all shitting on. Everybody fucked them. Like Howard stern was notorious for it. Yeah. We do the opposite. Start wars for ratings. Yeah, but we do the opposite. We all have successful podcast, but we all have each other on our podcasts. We're all super friendly about it. We all promote each other's specials. We all, we all hang out together. Like there's a camaraderie amongst comedians now. It used to be like there might be some comradery amongst a couple, but it would always go bad. You know, that there was never like bunch of real headliners hanging out together like they are now.

Speaker 4:          00:51:34       Yeah. Yeah. I mean even the simplest things like Dalea does something funny and I'll just put it, I'll talk about it all my open tabs and get like half a million views and then you just go like I deleted. It might be one of my favorite people to watch these days because I just watched his instagram will go, what's he doing today? He's ridiculous. I can totally talk about it all my open tabs and just share it with everyone. I just go, oh, great. Bernie shop. But like, dude, it's been funny shit.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Dean del Ray Singh. Yeah, I saw you posted that up. It's got. Okay. So I put that on my instagram is another good example. I put that on my instagram and it's got like 700,000 unique. It really saying fuck him. Like he can really sing like what? Like wait a minute, I didn't know you could do that. Yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:52:19       it's got 670,000 days living his best life man. I told

Speaker 4:          00:53:14       them, I go send me the whole fucking video, man, you, you. I go, you're a fucking murder a man. He's an inspiration man. He didn't, he did Conan tonight. I did Conan and he was so excited and it was so amazing to like burst showed

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       up. Everyone was in the back of the room and he came off. He was like, that's my first late night as well and I think Dean's 50. You got to respect it though. He just started stand up like 46 or something. Something like that. Yeah. It's very. It's not. It's not common. It's not common to stick with it and keep getting better at it. It was so cool to be on the end of Kona with him. Marin, Marin and dean. Just three comics and that's booking, but there's no celebrity. It's just three comics and deans. The only one that did stand up and just like, oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I saw someone said it was. It felt like the green room at the main room and the comedy store. Burrs limit. Let me tell you something. I. Burr Bill Burr is living as best fucking life right now. He does these when he does the garden or when he does the forum, they come in with the goddamn comedy jam and set up a thing and they do a full concert to an empty venue before the show.

Speaker 3:          00:54:15       They just do it for themselves. They just want to play the forum. He'll tell me he played from two to 6:30. Really? Yeah, just played all day, so I was exhausted. He was. I was worried. I was too tired to do the show. Hilarious. But that's how much fun he is having done. Do. What would you do if you did like would you set up a football game and football? Yeah. What would you do, man? I mean, I would watch one. I would just invite people to come watch a game. That means fucking flying helicopters. Playing drums. I mean, yeah. Yeah. No, he's not. This is an interesting time, but this is also. It shows you that because of all this camaraderie and that everybody's doing really well, it shows you that that's possible, that these, the old way of looking at things as the wrong way.

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       Yeah, that's a selfish famine thinking way wrong. Well, hire a Dj to bring me out to an event like that though. If I was doing an arena. Really does that. I think Chappelle does that. Russell brought out a MC Shan out on, always brings on stage to all his white audience and he freestyled the use all the breaks and all the white people just sat there staring at Russell and Russell was like, are you fucking kidding me? He's. He brings like old school legends everywhere. Well, he, he'll do a gig and then after a gig he'll go to a club and DJ. Yeah, he will. He can actually Dj to real dj DJ records and scratching and all that stuff. He knows his shit. He gets mad at those electronic music guys would call themselves Djs, DJ, Dj. He's goes back like, you got to be able to get vinyl.

Speaker 3:          00:55:53       Dig through the crates. Yeah. Flip it around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he knows his stuff, man. He really does. Well, he's another one that sells out. He's at that other place. A place that I was at in November. Really? Yeah. He's at the Scotia Bank. He's done that. A bunch. Hometown selling out giant places. There's so much of that going on with his seven time doing that too. Oh yeah. At least it's overwhelming, man. It really is, and I, I, you know what it is. I had a guy say to me one time, and I think this is what it is. I had a guy come up to me at West Palm, was doing a New Year's eve

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       drunk as fuck. Both of us probably were both shirtless. I'm doing the meet and greet and he goes, ah. He goes, I need to talk to you for like two minutes and the artist is that you wanted to fuck, you know, I get this a lot. I get, I'm good. Thanks. I'm done. He agreed, and so I go there like, sir, you got to move along and give them two minutes. And he's like, he's like, dude, I'm a fan. Do you know what that means? I was like, hey. And he goes, no, no, no, no, you're not listening to me when you do. Well, I get happy. He's like, it makes me happy to see good things happen to you. I will always be a fan, will always support you. And I, as soon as he said that, I thought it sounds super silly, but I'm.

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       Before I met you, I was a fan like when you, when that, when the Carlos stuff went down, I got, I've got behind your back and I was like, I'm a fan of Joe's. I like what he's doing that he's standing up for me. And in a weird way, being a fan of something so fucking fun when you become a fan and I think what podcasts have done is allowed you to enter by become intimate with your fans and they support you in a way. Like people go out and they see a video of dns singing and they go, oh yeah, I'm happy. We're all happy for him when you do 10,000 seats, I think there are people going, fuck yeah man, my guys winning. Does that make sense? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       no, I know what you're saying. Yeah. I think we're fans of each other too. That's big too. They also, people realize like, hey, like you can be a fan of someone. It doesn't mean that somehow or another you're a lesser person. You know what I mean? Like I'm sure bill burr is a fan of Chappelle. I'm sure Chappelle's a fan of Chris Rock, like people are fans of other people's art. Whereas I think in the past that wasn't the case. It was not. It was about separate camps. Yeah. I was like, I'm in this year on that side, which is so dumb, so dumb. Because you can also, it's like, you know, you can like, you can like one type of music the most, but still enjoy other music that when the Internet opened up all these possibilities, that's when it happened. Probably seems like it to me. I think it was podcasting. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:58:19       Like pea pod casting, I guess. Yeah. That is the Internet. I'm sorry, I was thinking of Youtube for some reason, but like can you imagine dice and kinison they hated each other. Hated each other. That was the way it works.

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       That was the bullet hole at the store. Oh, the belly room store. Sam kinison brought a gun and shot the fucking sign to let dice. Now that he was going to fucking shoot him. He didn't just pull out a gun. He pulled out a gun and shot a fucking sign. It's really crazy. Yeah. They just fixed it a few years ago. I was mad when they fix it. I'll fix that. Yeah. It's really crazy though. Yeah, got it. I got to start doing that to you, burt. Just shooting guns and guns and guns on name. Shoot it and shoot designed. Yeah, but I think those guys were doing co two and we smoked pot. That's way different ingredients to this whole thing. He smoked pot. You want to hug people, you do coke. You like, you want to fight, bro? Fuck you up. I'll hold you down. I'll fuck your mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       Fuck your mother. Fuck your mothers. Mother fucker. Bones. That'll start a business. Yeah. It's um, it's also, there was everyone's scratching and clawing. There wasn't a lot of opportunities. I think it's the pot tooth though. I think it's like guys like Diaz as an Ren, you and me, like there's a different sensibility. There's like a, a more generous sensibility. I think. So give me an. I think it's everything for me. I'm, I'm big. I'm big on generosity and I'm big on support. I think you have to do that with people around you. You become contagious too. Yeah. You know, when you have it done to you, you want to do it for others for sure. Yeah. It's giant. Yeah. Help out opening acts. Help out other comments. And as you rise up, they'll do the same. They'll do the same for the other guys and you see them doing that for a little start taking guys with them on the road and around.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Look, Ben, who do we like more than comics and where? What do you, who do you want to hang out with more than comedians? You know, there were the most fun for us to hang out with what we could say ridiculous shit and then we'll laugh at it. We won't like. Well, I don't know why it said that. Tommy, you shouldn't have called that lady at con. Especially not at friend. And then, you know, I think you owe or a sauna and apology. I mean if I was on I would've clocked you. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the people wouldn't think it's funny. Of course, if you were working at Xerox and he said all that people would, you know, they'd bring you into your liability. We've got to let you go. Got to go. It's true. I know when those are the worst people that get stuck at a dinner with or something, you know, you're like, oh shit. You just torture him. Yeah. It's the worst. Yeah, I used to feel terrible when I was around those people. I used to feel like there's something wrong with me. Yeah, because yeah, of course. Real stuck up super conservative people. I would just think there's something wrong with me. Why do I think this way? Why do I always want to say the inappropriate thing?

Speaker 4:          01:01:08       It's like a muscle twitch. Go. Just see how far you can make it a course. You start talking, be in a foot race. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       You just see eyes widen and they're like, yeah, you're like, dude, we're not at a seminar right now, and that's what's bullshit about seminars. Yeah, I mean, imagine if you were in the world of business. See, I really think this is one of the reasons why so many people are so fucked up. It's so depressed. I think the world of showing to, showing up to a place and then having your behavior limited into this very narrow and rigid parameters all day long and your livelihood and your success of your, your family and whether or not you can send your kids to a good school. All that dependent upon whether or not you're willing to play the rules, you have to wear an outfit with a suit and tie because if you don't, you might be unpredictable and you show up with that t shirt on. He's got a football shirt on at work. What the fuck is he drunk? What is crazy? He's doing drugs. You can't

Speaker 4:          01:02:10       little join around people that don't just like joints around people crashed. Tesla's stock

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       by $9,000,000,000 or some stupid shit. So crazy. Yeah, but not really. It bounced right back into that world. Like the guy can't. First of all, we were drinking whisky. Okay. No one has a problem with that, which is way more of a hard drug. Way more of a crazy drug than a little puff of a joint. We were drinking whiskey. No one cared. We drank whiskey for three hours. No one cared. Smoked a little joint. Oh, let you think. He inhaled it. Didn't look like it didn't look like it just took a ninth grader. He didn't know what to do. It took a little puff. You know, new kid at school just gets. Everyone just wants to do it too. No bad. Yeah. Fascinating. Yeah, it was crazy. He didn't. I mean another layer of it. He did it in California. Exactly. Totally. Totally legal.

Speaker 3:          01:03:06       Yeah. It's no different than having that class of whiskey. You know, California said you could fly with it. Now what? Lex said, you could have an ounce of weed with you on the airplane. They said, we don't know what the fuck's going to happen when you land somewhere where you can go through lax with an ounce of weed. I'm sorry. By the way, I looked up private suite after I talked to you. Super expensive. So expensive, stupid, expensive. How did you know about it? Sam Harris? He told me about it. Yeah. Yeah, Mike. I like people. I don't mind going to the airport and saying hi to people that that thing is like $7,000 a flight. It's pretty. It was wild trivia. No, no, I think it was $3,000. It's a membership. I thought the membership was it and they're like, membership gets you, so you pay 4,500 to be a member and then $2,700 for a domestic flight per flight for like your own entrance.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       Uh, you know, whatever your own meals you're on, check in your own a Tsa Room. You hang out and make it sounded cool for like, like a family vacation or something. You know, if you're Chris Pratt, it's definitely makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Summer, a list, actor type person who shouldn't go anywhere. Yeah, if you're Tom Cruise. But he said, but those guys, they have to fly private. They do. They own their own planes. Most of them, you know, they get. There's some article online about John Travolta's yacht pull up John Travolta's yacht. It's probably got a bet if you went over that fucking thing with a black light.

Speaker 3:          01:04:33       It was level like a Jackson pollock painting. Just pretty fucking splatters Jesus just got a new yet everywhere. Apparently by the cabin boy. This place really is lightened up. Boy Place. Got Five locks on the door, lock bolts on the inside. I'm outside. All the deckhands are really worn out here. Yes. You have very weird latex outfits for them to where? Oh yeah. It's the money that that fucking guy must have. God, he's got his own jet and he has his own jet jet. He has a seven. 40 seven? Yeah. Seven 47. Yes. And he has a runway and his for. He

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       has like multiple planes, like look at that full story behind Toronto's private jet fleet. Like he's got his arm out the window. It flies to the window. Fucking commercial plane. Yeah. In the back room is just. It's all like a slip and slide with baby oil. I look at that. Look how many you have got multiple gulfstreams. If he flew for Quantus as a commercial pilot. He did. Yes. He. They actually let him flop. He's that good of a pilot. Wow. That I think he has some sort of commercial standing with Quantas. He has a military jet just in case someone calls Homo flies over and flux. That's really crazy. Mad at him asking to get a hand job at a massage. See? Yeah. That's. It's funny stories about it, but this hash tag baller. Holy Shit. Yeah. That is bawling. That's a crazy man. I mean that's like $100,000,000 yacht right there. Where, where did he make all his money?

Speaker 2:          01:06:22       I mean, how much money do you make from like pulp fiction hit that one. That would be about being a Russian spy or teaching or his forte, you know, like his, like his wealth, wealth, wasn't he? He'd kind of depleted when pulp fiction was like around [inaudible] 93. Yeah. And then that made him so famous and hot again that he was just, he was a $20,000,000 movie guy for for a while. That was lasting face off. Yeah. All those days off. So he's. But he's doing terrible movies now. Yeah. Izzy? Yeah. You did that movie. It's supposed to be. We should probably have a fight companion for God. I heard it was really bad. I've heard it's so bad. You wish. Do you wish to do November rolls around? We can get drunk again. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. That hammered and watch this God movie. It's supposed to be a wretched sack of shit. Let's do it. Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. We'll do that because we've been being to do that. What was the other terrible movie we're meaning to do that with? I have it on his head. Auror that movie about. Well, that's right. That's right. There was a movie where a guy who was a lion trainer actually made a movie with lions and a bunch of people that were making the thing. Oh, play the play the clip. Let's hear the clip.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       Hmm? Nah, hold on. Do you have the wrong music plan that this is. This is a scene slash trailer from Godaddy.

Speaker 9:          01:07:42       Say That on the cover of the paper.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       Wait a minute. Music. The music is really the sting song. That's how it was. Pizza Shit movie. This is the trailer sucks. Look at this as like an acting class. Good. Let it play out.

Speaker 10:         01:07:58       Oh, hold on a second. I'm sure to pull the audio off.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       Oh, well we'll do Youtube Yankees for the audio. You look at them.

Speaker 9:          01:08:08       There's a look. So fake.

Speaker 10:         01:08:15       No.

Speaker 3:          01:08:22       Okay. Kill it. We can't do this. This is so bad, I can't even do a mobster anymore. It's like it feels like a joke to play. You could do it, but it would have to be like, do you have to be authentic James Gandolfini back to life. Like if James Gandolfini was alive today, he could be a movie. Yeah, sure. Because you believed it, right? It's got to be authentic. Yeah. You'd believe it, but he gotta be. It's gotta be done. I mean, Scorsese, you could probably do it again, like it's just. There's just a bunch of people. He's got a new one coming when he's playing young. God, he just looks like a grown up. Danny Zuko.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       Hey. Apparently Danny, Danny in the greasers tell you what, man. After the sopranos came on the air, everybody wanted to be Italian. It was one of those gross moments in time where all these Italians were like empowered and they were all talking like goon Baas and they, they, they all wanted to fucking get together and have pasta on old pecan pies. Like ramped it up, say Matsuura. Most of them started doing the hand gestures, like the guys come out of that going on and you know, as a person who's legitimately Italian, it was disgusting. You fucking apes. Are you doing? Yeah, you, he's, yeah. They ramped it up, you know, and then like Greek people are like, I'm a Italian. Start pretending that they're designed for sure. It was, you know, there was a time where there was so many auditions for so many fucking movies that we're talking about a town all Italians. What is this life on the line? It's another, a power line guy. By the way. We should this. This is probably worse for sure. Fuck. How about urban cowboy? That's the premise of urban cowboy.

Speaker 3:          01:10:15       Urban Cowboy. He worked on the line, will have a double feature. I thought our night. Well we'll play God and we'll play life on the line and we'll sync. We'll have people sync it up. This is what. We'll do this, mark those to mark those two movies and so we'll get those on the Netflix and we'll, we'll, after sober October is over, we'll get fucking hammered. Will bring a five gallon jug, a Tito's in here to movies and I love it. I love it. I rented a Bruce Willis one to laugh at like I was like, this is going to be a piece of shit. And it didn't get, it didn't get bad until like 25 minutes were left. I was actually, this is pretty good. It was this, uh, I think it's called deathwish, which is a death wish. Bruce Willis? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it was actually really well done until like third act really. Then it fell apart, but I'm watching it like this is going to be a piece of shit and 30 minutes. Am I sick? Good fucking movie. It was like with the snowman. Did you

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       see the snowman? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. That was a snowman. Death wish. Bruce Willis is better than I thought. Yeah, I thought it was going to. He got delayed for some reason why they get delayed because of mass shootings or something. Oh boy. I think so, yeah. Something along those lines. Six point four. And I am deb. I mean the trailer got real dog shit. Yeah. You talking to me, a guy I enjoyed Hudson Hawke. I was a big part was man, eight percent rotten tomatoes. The snowman is. Spoiler alert. The snowman ends. It's this guy. Don't spoil it. It's. It's so ridiculous. It's so fucking ridiculous. What's it about? It's about a serial killer who a snowman is leaving. Snowman says hints and he's cutting off body parts and then arranging them in the snow. So fast vendor is a alcoholic cop who is trying to solve it.

Speaker 4:          01:12:13       Who's Michael fassbender music from promethium it. See the robot from takes place abroad, right? Isn't it takes place, but may have. I don't want to talk negatively, but val kilmer, his performance is so disturbing that you. It pulls you out. The movie immediately is terrible on it. Knows when he's going through the throat stuff and they dubbed his voice in this. They had him dub his voice so they took out his voice because he couldn't understand them I guess. And then they had. They dumped his voice move. I mean, it's like, it's so bad that it throwed pills you out and you're like, you definitely should have just not had him in the movie and let him get healthy. I think he's doing better now. Hopefully. No, I think he is. I think he's gone into remission, you know. I'll tell you what, man, he fucking stole the show.

Speaker 4:          01:13:00       And Wyatt earp. Remember that kilmer? Amiya huckleberry. Remember that Shit. You name all the moon. He, uh, the doors he was murdered. He was a monster. Marus val kilmer is a motherfucker genius. CV can get that scene from hint with val kilmer as a white, a dark holiday. Dark holiday in wider. The funniest piece of shit he made. Did you see the. I like the saint and I like the superhero movie right now. That was like a spy. Like I play again. I get in disguise. Cranked. This is the very end. Hold on. Okay. The audio we pull up. This is a great fucking scene and this is a great scene. Just the thing about the scene as you believe it, you just believe him. Well, not dude, realize it's the wrong guy. I didn't understand the scene until recently. People can't hear this on youtube. No. Okay, so can talk.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Yeah. I didn't understand that. He's. This is him. The reason that I didn't understand why the guy was scared. It's because doc holiday wants to die in a gunfight. Yeah, because he's dying. Yeah. He wants to be shot. But also he was killing everybody. Doc Holliday was a fucking monster and this guy was a want to be bad ass and he realized that Doc Holliday was going to fuck them up. I've never seen this. You never saw this serious. I don't like Westerns. I hate horses. You hate horses? I do hate horses. I. I've just never liked. This is about fucking horses. Tom. I don't like this time. I don't like this. I don't like the aesthetic. I don't like their hats. I've seriously. I really. I'm serious. I don't like any of it. Are you shitting me? One of the best movies ever. Not Interested because occasionally they get on a horse and I don't like their hats. Yeah. Can you look lower? Yeah, still bothers me. I like the mustaches. Okay. Sweaty is. Yeah, we got close. They are to each other. Do you think people really just did that close to each other and had gunfights oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:15:24       Dun, Dun, Dun. I wouldn't mind doing a gunfight with you Tom. Oh Shit. Come on. He wants him to shoot him now.

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       Wow. It doesn't seem as good. Second time around. Maybe in the context of the entire movie. I love these mustaches. They all look like alt comics now. Kurt Russell was weird. I must make a batch to ice cream. Wait a minute. Comics are all comics really anymore. I felt like that does evaporated as real. I think it's still real. It's one of my favorite things. Watching all comics go up in the main room. Yeah. You see it, you know the, um, they kind of get walk in shell shocked. They already know that it's not that their crowd. You could see. I didn't realize what that was until you just said it. I've seen it before and I've always been like, oh, this is your first time here. You can see in their eyes and you're like, oh, you're gonna. Love it. This is the greatest team in the world. Yeah, man. It's so funny to get more aggressive. You can tell. It's like a natural get aggressive about being progressive. Motherfuckers aggressively progressive. Yeah. I remember when all was like thought of as you were. If you were all. You were like soft and progressive and sensitive and kind. Now alt is right, like all right, you think of, you think of outright

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       like that's all you hear about now. It's like, all right. Which is like assholes. You think of racism, xenophobia, like the word all got sort of hijack. That's true. Yeah. I didn't even think about that, but it does. You say, Oh, most people's mind will definitely go outright over the last few years, but like in the context in the world of comedy, it actually oddly usually implied somebody who's probably far to the left. Yeah, but only with us. I think only within income with audiences. I don't think they even know that expression anymore. I feel like true all universally publicly has sort of been hijacked by. All right, or at least the definition of it hijacked by outright people. That's true. That is true, right? I don't.

Speaker 4:          01:17:59       Yeah, I guess so. I, I assume there's got to be an ot left, right? Well, I think

Speaker 1:          01:18:04       was, but I think the problem is once you say all now everybody just thinks, right. See, I would have automatically turned out. Left. Sounds made up. Yeah. What? What is, what are the alternative to the right of the ideas? It's young, right? So. Okay. But assholes. So like the right. If you think of conservative, you would think of like Lindsey Graham, you think of people that are probably racist, but they keep it up.

Speaker 4:          01:18:33       Slippery shoes and the Lindsey Graham was a chick until this week. I literally went, that's it, dude. I thought it was a $6,000,000 woman. Oh, he's got that southern accent that you can't tell if it's gay or not. It's the same thing. It's like, oh, well I'll do the quail.

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       Yeah. Yeah. There's, this is weird watching these cavenaugh hearings. The whole thing is so strange.

Speaker 4:          01:18:57       Oh, you gotta you gotTa. Keep your head down if you do not agree with the. Like I, I just, I just tweeted that. Uh, can you imagine defending your high school yearbook? That's all I tweeted. I saw that and it was a fucking shit show. I saw that. Yeah. And I was like, I'm fucking out. You can't. People can't recognize that you're not in support of this guy. You're not in support of anything like, but it's, it's a real thing and virtue signal simply show that people know, Oh, I'm on your team. I'm just, I'm just a fucking comedian. I'm just making an observation early. Can you imagine defending your six year high school yearbook?

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       You remember Hicks is bit about Clarence Thomas. No, no. I'm sure I've heard it. Hicks had a bit about Clarence Thomas when they were. They were trying to bring him into Supreme Court. Oh Man. I wish I could remember exactly how the bit went, but it was a great bit, but it was about his porn collection. You know, like Mr Hare?

Speaker 4:          01:19:55       Oh yes, yes, yes. Familiar at all with clam lap was volumes one through all of them. Says all of them. Yeah, it was just like this funny bit like examining.

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       That was funny by the way. Lindsay Graham, what do you see like after he left, where they decided they voted on that they're going to. Well, they voted that's going to move to the floor, but they decided like, you know, we'll try to do this extra week of, uh, the FBI investigation and then he goes, somebody's going to have to explain this to trump. I guess that'll be me. The press basically is a not so subtle way of being like, dum, dum doesn't get it. So I'll trump said to one of the fucking reporters today, now what a female reporter said. He goes, he pointed to a woman and he said, go ahead. And he goes, she can't, she's speechless. She can't believe I, I, I called on her and she goes, well, I didn't think. He goes, yeah, you don't think, yeah, I get that. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       And she goes, I'm sorry sir, like, listen to this. Listen to this, listen to this. You never do let's, let's say this. Listen this. He can't help himself. He's crazy. Yeah, she's shocked that I picked her state of shock. I'm not thinking that. That's okay. I know you're not thinking you never do. No, go ahead. Why that's president. That's such a crazy thing to say to someone. Yeah. No, I know. You're not thinking you never do. She must be someone that's written really negative things about you. He knows, you know, he's got that hit list and everything. Is this a piece of shit? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Of course. It's all things madness. He keeps a record here. They have records of, you know, anyone who's slided. Um, anyone who's written anything bad said anything for sure man. See, I'm not, I'm not a confrontational. I don't like confrontation. So part, there's part of me that goes, uh, like I always thought I wish Kim Jong Un would be a fan so I could go over and party with him for a week.

Speaker 3:          01:21:47       What? You don't think that way? Yeah. What luth dictators and party with him, Bro. You want to party with him? I would really like free Adele Castro would have been crazy to dense robin if you went over there, partied with him. And then just like, I don't know, like the next morning when you're like, I had the best time, he was like, send them to a labor camp. Fuck this guy. Fuck you want to lose some weight? How about I give you one grain of rice a day, man, that would be fun. And you drank piss my pis. That's it. You want stay hydrated is a jug of pis. I guess I'm the only one that thinks that way. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No one wants to go party with them. We talked with the fucking ruthless dictator. You get offered a private gig. They're like, hey man, it's an. It's a, it's in Pyongyang.

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       Seemed to fly you private. Are we getting paid before? I kind of need a little bit upfront. I think maybe deposit, flight, private. It's going to be really amazing. [inaudible] a million dollar super private. You know what? Flying privates like sitting down. So awesome. Just sitting down. Why? Why would they be amazing? You're sitting. Yeah. It's nothing. It's not like you're flying private people rubbing your feet and sucking your Dick. No ice cream. Ice Cream movies. Playing the music is fucking full. Three d surround sound. You could make those things happen if you want. Yeah, if you want to fly private. Dan Bilzerian probably does that. When he flies. It's the draw for flying private. I obviously I can't afford it. Omega three or four days just wouldn't make any money on the road. But is that you get done and you go home, you get done and you go to a.

Speaker 3:          01:23:26       You get on a plane and you fly home or you just wait 20 minutes and you saved $30,000. Not Twenty minutes. Wouldn't be nice to get on a plane. You fly private. You fucking cock done it. Are you calling that? God has no idea. He's just making them a cup. You fly private though. I don't fly private and you have flow private for like a couple of times but it's never like. Because I was like, ah, I just got to get home. It was. It was. Instead of doing crazy transpo to get to a Gig for a short of short flight though I don't do it like on a red, call them out, call them out for flying private. I saw that because I never thought about it in the news like when. That'd be nice. And I was like, yeah, well you know, it's one of the grossest celebrity things ever is the posing in front of the private jet.

Speaker 3:          01:24:12       Dude doesn't know what all the Comedians don't do that though because that's all I guess they do. Yeah. I'm black ones but I'm saying this, not our friends. Oh, I know. I know. A few that suck. That do it. Yeah. I've seen. Are you looking at me looking at you because you know who I'm talking about. I mean there's only. You can do it too. It's just a weird thing. It's like it would definitely pose in front of it shirtless. You know? He would. What? Would it be weird if we were all on a private jet flying somewhere and we post this stuff. Would that be okay? Yeah, because that's like dig in Aspen to celebrate. After sober October is over, we decided to book a Gig together and we all were shirtless yammered on the runway looking rip because we're gonna lose shitloads of weight this month and we all post.

Speaker 3:          01:25:01       That's fine. Right? Let's do this. I'm really excited now. How much, what's the most amount of points you've gotten in a month and a month? Yeah, I think it was right just under 4,500. Forty 500 is a lot. Yeah, so the most I've seen somebody do with seven. Seven. Oh, that's crazy. But that's like you're really, really going after it all the time, you know, probably probably 30 days. More than twice of what I did for 15 days. Right. [inaudible]. Yeah, that's crazy. That's a lot of work. Oh, here's the thing we didn't discuss though. So what's the bet? What are the stakes? What are we doing right? What happens if you win? What happens if you lose? First of all, it's just us because ours isn't even in this bed. He asked, he goes, well, it goes. My long walks. We couldn't stop giggling because I'm like pictured already shirtless in New York with a chest strap on it. Fuck yeah, he's. He's, I think he's going to be San hope

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       called me and said he wanted to do it. I can do this though. Yeah. He's not going to do this and he's also not going to. He's like sober octoberish I can't go off everything or I'll have a stroke. Will nest that. He can't go off everything. He just can't go off of the meeting is actually going to a doctor this week and he's going to get himself checked out. Which is a rare thing is stan hope. I don't know if you know those stand up is sort of a policy to not go to the doctor and when it breaks he dies. Yeah. That's his idea. His idea didn't want Mris, doesn't want diagnosis, doesn't want recommendations, doesn't want prescriptions. He is going this week. He's going to go this week to get himself checked out to make sure that he can go. So I think, I mean, as much as Stan hope is sort of a fatalist and he loves being this lovable drunk and I can't feel good to just always be drunk, it just can't feel good.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       I don't know. He's taken time off before I. I know he's taken time off before smoking as well. I know he quit smoking for quite a while at one point in time. I think he would like to be healthier, you know? I mean I know he would. He would have more energy. I think it would make his comedy better. I really do not. This comedy is not amazing. It is. But I just think you'd have more energy know energy is a big thing. So I think and I also think he's something to do and connects them to us. He's out there and fucking bumfuck Bisbee Arizona out with a bunch of dorks there.

Speaker 2:          01:27:29       I like, I like partying as fuck you like partying anywhere. Yeah. You do party in North Korea. You fuck the out. The invites out there. I hope to God. Somebody just puts us in front of him. Encrypted email. They go, Kim, this, and then I want you to watch a machine story, and then he watches and he goes, ah, let's make another one. Let's make. I've had, I've had moments where that where people go, we could get you into some trouble and I got fucking scared. I was with a group in Tanzania. They were like, we're going to go kidnap a baby elephant if you're into it. I was mad. Damn Dude. Kidnap a baby elephant. Yeah. Another tribe. Kidnap this elephant sanctuary and they get the kid back and the Messiah was going into kidnap back and I was like, part of me is like, if you get a little bit of a buzz I'm in, but that was just.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       Sounds like a good way to die. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Instagram video. It's all about the insta stories. The um, I have the time to do those instastories because it does not interfere with actual life. Like how, how often are you present in real life when you're doing. I look at your dots on your instastory and like Jesus, there's like 70 dot. No, I don't ever put that many. I put up, I'll probably put up 10 a day. That's the same thing. Yeah. What's up? It's not mine or yours might be mine. Why is it beeping? Do I take it off of this? Having it hanging like that, but sometimes it'll just do it anyways, but yeah, it's fine like that for working out. If it beeps. One beat means it's on that three beat means I shut all the beeps off on the APP so I could use it in yoga class. Yeah. Oh,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       okay. Yeah. I don't want it to beep. And of course, you know. Yeah. You know, you can wear those sensors right if you want it to like make, get a good reading to start. It worked out great. It was good. I look at instastories, I look at instagram as part of business.

Speaker 1:          01:29:16       Start me again. Fucking thing's annoying. Uh, you looked at as part of business.

Speaker 4:          01:29:22       Part of my business and so I go, I am very present in life. I don't, it's the story, everything, but like in moments like when the rat runs into our house, I definitely learned the story that I always have my phone on me. It's in my pocket. I like how you're like, I'm very present. And then right before we started you're like, I'm terrible at this at home. That was not a good parent. I'm taking care of my kids by myself, my wife somewhere traveling abroad. It all these dots, Bro. That ain't 10 dots like this one. What the fuck are you on? Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight dots. Yeah, it looks like more. I said I love the school with a bag of rice, but it's only 1:00 PM and you have eight dots already summer from last night and yesterday it's 24 hours. Okay. But yeah, I, I'm, I'm parenting by myself. I can't do, I'm not good at it. I, it's, it's a good chance to bond with your kids. It is. Or they realize exactly how out of touch you are with their lives. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       um, I'm not one for giving parental advice, but what I would say to do is abandoned all other things you do while you're doing it. So think of yourself as like a mom, like a house mom, like instead of like trying to squeeze it in with all the other shit you do, you won't be good at it if you do that. If, when I, if, if, if, if my wife goes somewhere and I have to just take care of my kids. I don't do anything else. I schedule nothing, nothing else. If I do a podcast, I have to do it during the day while the kids are at school and then once there I don't go to, I don't do shows that night. I don't do shit. I just hang out with them and we do shit. Make sure I do take them to a pottery class. So we'll go to a fucking Dojo. Boom. One of those bouncy places. They have trampolines and shit. Dude. Just do stuff with them and leave your phone off, leave your phone off. Your kids are there. Unless unless you want your wife to contact you, maybe that, but don't look at your twitter, just hang out with them. It's um, it's, you have to like have like rules in your head.

Speaker 4:          01:31:22       My kids are a lot older kids though. Yeah. But still you want to interact with them and no matter how old they are, I know. But your kids are still young. Minor, minor, like 14 and 12 and so yeah. But don't you hang out with them and do stuff? Last night we watched deadpool. Cool. We're going out to dinner tonight. Perfect. Yeah, but just the actual getting up, I was telling Tom I got up at 5:45 to get, make them breakfast and, and my daughter, my oldest daughter had already pulled the trash out, put it by the door, back door for me to take out. Was literally gave me a speech and I was like, just so you know, you need to be ready to go at 5:45. Like you can't just get up at 5:45 and kind of like slow roll into the morning. I'm at school a C, they've got to be.

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       She got to be at school at eight I think, but it's usually lecturing you, Dr. I said, but and leanne was loving it. Leanne calls. He's like, yeah, you got to get going. You can't just get up and be regular burger, your daddy on duty. Got I. I made the mistake of saying I was going to make pancakes and everyone was like, you can't, you don't have time to make pancakes. And I was like, guys, if I'm going to make pancakes, I'm making pancakes. I've got the standard batter storage and they're like, we need something else. We're already hungry. We've got to go. And so yeah, we're on a schedule with Lianza gangster with that shit. I just, when you phoned me into her life, my brain doesn't work like that.

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       Right? Yeah. I get that. But it's like when you're just hanging out with them, just them. It's a, you've got to realize is. I mean it's for everyone that has kids, just you only have a few of these years. You know, you only, you only have a few and then next thing you know, they're adults. It happens quick. Yeah. So 14. What happened overnight? You know, I have friends that don't have good relationships with their kids and weird. It's weird to see that sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. It's weird to see kids that are resentful, angry at you. You got that comment? For sure. For sure. Right? Is that coming? No. Teenagers is tough, man. It is tough there. Well, first of all, being a teenager's fucking tough. You gotta like remind them over and over again. You're dealing with a term called downpour of hormones that you just don't know what to do with. You remember what that was like? Yeah. Yeah. You're so confused all the time. Confused bodies in fucking disarray for you. It's probably exacerbated by like them being like this generation then knowing that you're racist. Fucking trunk and racist. And then the crossfit people are picketing outside your house.

Speaker 1:          01:33:53       What are our steaks? So that haven't worked. Okay. So the most you've ever, the most you've ever gotten is um, so what did I, what did I get today? 200 or something like that. What did I get to 11 to 11. That's a normal workout for me, right? I think 200 is like a is a good strong workout. Yeah. So good. Normal workout. So if you get 200, well if I did 200 twice a day, Jesus men, how many days a week you plan on doing that? I'm going hard son. I'm trying to kill Bert.

Speaker 4:          01:34:27       I'm in. I'm in for the challenge. Yeah, I mean I want you to say that Mickey Mantle genes. Real well. Shit. You did the UVA. You just heard what he's doing. I know and I understand that. I have that. I have the accessibility to get there. I'm, I'm up for the challenge. But you're planning on Joe, you're planning on trust. Yeah, but you're actually planning a 400 points a day. You're running six days a week, let's say, or what? Yeah, at least. Yeah. I might go seven, seven days a week. So how about I lose 400 points a day? Can

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       I do different things? That's true. That's the key to it. We put an 8,000 points. You're close to it. I want to try to pretty close to eight. That's the only thing is I have a hunting trip that's going to take me away for six days. I have a cruise that's t to take me away for five, but when I think of Bobby Kelly's going to. When I'm doing the hunting trip, like I'll put. I'll send this to you jamie. You see what I'm like. A typical day in the mountains is like when you're. That's some of the most brutal workouts I've ever done because you're hiking at altitude and when you're at altitude man, it's fucking. I did 12 miles a day. Thirty 1000 steps. Shit. One hundred and 16 floors at 8,100 feet. Well, just so you know, if like if you wore it, that's a.

Speaker 2:          01:35:47       that's a typical day in the mountains hunting. If you wore it by the way for that, you would just, you know, it would come out to some crazy number. How many steps did you say? I mean that's 31,000 steps. Twelve, 12 miles in the mountains, but it's the thing is the elevation you're going up and down hills and stepping over logs and you're always, always breathing heavy. It's rough. Are you going to wear it for that? Fuck Ya. Okay. Jesus Christ. Fuck, I guess I'm running another marathon. I mean that's working out. You want me to run around that Goddamn cruise ship? So 120,000 points a year. A month would be. You know, you can't get them any points left. There's no way. What are you talking to them when were talking to 8,000 at the most. Like he said, he said 4,500 was his best. His best month and that's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:36:41       That was working out like probably 22 or 23 days and doing, you know, something like 200 plus points each time. That's amazing. Okay, so 8,000 is redeemable. Yeah. That's crazy. Okay. Your best. Most 4,000 now the without like being in a competition. I've hit 43, 4,400 let's say. Okay. Okay. Joe Immediately would get 6,000 if you just did what you did today. Everyday. At this month you can just do it if I did it every day every year, but that was just the morning workout today. But we're all doing to a dose. I got this recognized school here. We got to have someone call the fucking rock so we know we're going to stay on this and this makes me more excited than anything. Yeah, no, it's good. It's good to challenge whatever it is. Listen, we should all come in even and just make red pay for everything was never going to. He's never gonna catch up to big shout out our. I mean our, we've said it before, but he really did come through on that bet. He did. I'm saying um, when he took us to the game, he bought crazy tickets and I thought they were much less. He gave us a first class experience.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       Nice. And um, we should make them do it again. Yeah. Like what would be the stakes go? It's gotta be. It's gotta be something that we can all participate in. Floyd Mayweather. Manny Pacquiao to Ooh, that's a great one. Front row we're talking about. Yeah. By the way, by the way, say whatever you want about me being on my phone the entire time. I have the best fucking video from that of the last, the last them scoring a touchdown videotape, the touchdown, and they cut to Tom and are a nice. Yeah, no, it's great. That was a really fun fucking weekend. That was dude. Pick. That place is going. That's where Larry, the cable guy performs. Oh my God. Fucking places like that. It's so big. As audiences are winds, floyd mayweather, Pacquiao. I don't know. I think it's in December. Is it in December? Yeah, definitely. It might be in Japan though, into. This might be a day of a book to get. So I don't know. There's talk that it might be their guys. Oh, let's go to that in Japan. That sounds crazy, but it also. That's like asking a hundred grand. We're not flying. Coach are not flying coach. She lost. There's no way

Speaker 1:          01:39:16       he could win. Right? So someone has to someone else to win. But more importantly one person is going to lose. Oh. So like if you beat me and I beat you, that don't mean shit because we're all beating Ari.

Speaker 3:          01:39:27       Right? It's like a skins game. He's already, but you know, he's going to be like, I'm not

Speaker 1:          01:39:31       doing the fucking point. Maybe, but maybe he's listening to us right now. He's stewing. Should we call him? He's getting angry and he's sober, which Mike might do even more. I was like, fuck you. I'm going to win. We're going to fucking win. What if red goes crazy? Fucking goes whole hog every day. Six hours a day. Takes spin classes and crossfit classes and whereas it, during Jujitsu, floyd mayweather, his planet come back in Tokyo before his rematch with Mandy.

Speaker 3:          01:40:00       This was a couple weeks ago. So. Oh, so he wants a tune up fight. Huh? I might not be real. Yeah. Might that be?

Speaker 1:          01:40:07       Yeah. I'm, I'm, you know, would you go to that? You have to go to the fight though. Yes. It'd be an interesting fight. I mean, they're both past their prime, but it will be a fun event too. Yeah. But I mean was just knocked out. Lucas, PTSA and floyd hasn't fought in a year since he beat conor Mcgregor, but that's not a real box. I mean it's a boxing match, but it's on a boxing match at an elite level. Like if it was, if he was boxing terrence Crawford or someone who's like at the very top now, he's not in that kind of zone right now, but he's still the best ever. It if not the one of assurance of the greatest boxers in the history of the world ever.

Speaker 3:          01:40:44       You know, no question. What we should do is tear the tear of the winnings. Okay. First place pays for nothing. Whole weekend. I liked this idea. Second pays for their pace, for their tickets to whatever is least expensive, pays for their ticket and nothing else. Third place plays for a. all hotels are saying tear it off, so that's the last place. Just pays the most out, but he's not. He's not dropping so forth. Twenty grams in the last place. Person has to cover flights, but they can use their miles. See, the problem is res bets are like, no, no, no. The loser has to wear a beard of my pubes and he's got a. he's got to clean his face with his fucking all of his suggestions. So psychotic, drink all of our pis and I really am solid over my shoulder. She goes, no, no, you were not drinking.

Speaker 3:          01:41:37       Everyone's pissed. He said, he's like, you got to do a panhandler for six hours on the radio. She was a homeless guy who was like, I'm into that already. But yeah, he's, yeah. He wanted us to do really ridiculous shit, like down the street naked. The tears of paying for it. So it's not all. It's a good idea. Right? So one person doesn't take the whole beating. First place pays nothing all week. That's true. The first place should be. I don't cover the first place. You'd get like a belt. We should make a belt. Sure. October belt. A real one. Like a real, real wild. Like a wwe. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, October, October, October. Belt Champ, champ. Jamie, I need. This is a project I need you to look up where you would get a pro wrestling belt. Not Know knockoff shit. No, no. Nice one. Oh God.

Speaker 3:          01:42:28       I just got. I just found my inner voice when I work out that fucking belt. Just. Oh my God, I'm so excited. Inner Voice. So you're going to start doing your two days, but I might be doing three days. Wow. Looking at him. Looking at me. Serious. He's excited now, Dude. Oh, now tell him he ain't shit and there's no way he'll win this firearm up even more. Tell me I can't run a marathon. You can definitely ran the marathon, but there's no way you'll win this though. There's no way. Oh Wow. Tommy's got reverse psychology. We can get a pepsi belt. Who the fuck wants a Pepsi Belt? I know a guy. He's diabetic. So what? Which we have on the uh, is that me up on the right there? I think it's a bearded gentleman bell. Okay. So we found a company that makes belts. What's the name of his company? Belts.com. Okay. So we need some sort of a logo. We need sober. October is definitely the name of it, right? The sober October belt and undisputed sober Ciobo champ. Yeah. Oh yeah. What should we have on it? Still? Okay. I should be our faces engraved in it. Should it be like the, like the no smoking sign? No boost sign. No pills, no needles, no need to get on the sides. Yeah. Good with needles, piles

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       of coke. And then guy tried to suck his own dick and we'll just tell everyone it's yoga. Yeah. So we'll have to come up with how long does it take to make one of these belts month? Let's find out. Hey listen, whoever pro-am belts, if you're listening. Three to four weeks. Oh fucking fun. So if we finished the design by the end of this week, we might be able to have it at the end of the month. You might be holding up that build up the house. I feel great. You definitely want to be holding up at all. I'll definitely either me or joe flights. Lodging tickets. Mrs. Missing you. There's no way. Forty $500 maybe you've never worked out with them. I've worked out with them. What happens? Oh, he gives up. He used to work out together. Done like hotel, like pre before we did. Actually we went, when we were in Phoenix, we went to a like an MMA gym. Oh, that's right. Yeah, that's right. We did. We worked out. Yeah. I tell him. I used to go to Barry's bootcamp together.

Speaker 4:          01:44:54       What happened? I, I don't mind throwing up if I work out. Like I like I ended up like, you enjoy it. I do because I know that I've done it as hard as I can do it. I get it. I've thrown up before a girl came into my green room this weekend and threw up all. I thought she was looking for the bathroom and just fucking throw up. I'm like, that's your kind of crowd. I started throwing up, by the way, your pr, your Promo you showed me. It's going to bring in more vomiters. I cut a promo. I'm doing. It'll be dropping next Monday. We're announcing my tour next week, but uh, I cut a promo hurling. No, no, no. It's just what it's like being at one of my shows and just fucking chaos. It's chaos. Yeah. Well your shows or chaos. You, you're not doing just a comedy show.

Speaker 4:          01:45:41       You've got like a whole Party experience happening. We got mean stand up and stand up straight, stand up. And then a lot of times I do a meet and greet people get to talk and hang out. I think as a fan I liked that. So I do that. And then a lot of times at the end of the night and a lot of times I go, I'll be at the bar next door and uh, everyone goes to the bar. Those are fucking crazy. Do you think you can do that when the crowds get to like 3000, $4,000? Of course not. I don't know. I actually had a real loose, had conversation about what meet and greets are going to look like on this theater tour because I don't want to get rid of the meet and greet. So it means it as silly as it sounds, but I think it means something for them to hang out does.

Speaker 4:          01:46:19       And I don't want to charge 100 bucks for a meet and greet, but I definitely can't do 1200 people like I did when I did the Wilbur. I told everyone to go meet me at the bar next door and it was fucking chaos. I mean it was like, oh, like literally elbow to assholes and I just was not, I didn't get to hang out with anyone. I was just taking pictures over and over and over. So I want to try to figure out some workaround for a meet and greet for this theater tour. Because Dude, when I go to Scandinavia, I want to meet to meet podcasts. You know, one thing that annoys me, those pictures where

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       people have stacks of pictures they want you to sign and the sound that is not, does not like take a picture with me. That's not, will you sign this from my friend that's not sign this for me. That's like you're asking me to work. And they fucking shame. And they go, they come out with the one that, hey, we sent. You Go, oh yeah. And then the sixth behind it come to the site and they're like, and this and this and this and this. Some guy, the other day I had 30. Yeah, whoa. Yeah, they, they've, they've run into you at the airport and there's like six dudes and they have stacks like, hey man, you're, you're showing up and you want me to work. This is what you're doing. You want me to stop what I'm doing? And you think it's only, it's only five minutes of your time.

Speaker 1:          01:47:27       Yeah, that's true. But you're not really a fan. You're just a guy trying to get me to work for sure. This is, you signed them. I signed one. I'll say I'll sign one, I'll sign one. And they get mad. Like some guy got mad and philly remember that dude got upset. He's famous. And I was like, you're not a fan. You just told me you're not a fan. He told me. He literally told me, he's like a huge. You don't even sell. Well he goes, you're so full, like $7. I go, I don't give a fuck what they sell for my autograph. I go, I said, don't, don't show up at the airport and harassed me. Then I, I'll sign one.

Speaker 4:          01:48:00       Do you do a meet and greet? You used to do meet and greet tonight.

Speaker 1:          01:48:02       I used to do. I'll still do that, but I used to do meet and greets at the Chicago theater for 3,700 people. I would wait and take photos with everybody, but you can't do it anymore. People go too crazy as the podcast got crazier and crazier. People go crazy and they were hold on your arm and want to tell you how you changed their life and want to tell you like long stories. I'm like, look, there's 500 people behind you waiting. I can't give you 15 minutes here. I can give you five minutes. I just, it just got too strange and it just got too many people wanting to get on the podcast like you got to get me on. I'm going to tell you my story about beating drug addiction. Like I'm sure it's a great story. I can't get you on a stop.

Speaker 1:          01:48:44       This is not how this works. You know? There's just too much of that, too much. It's not. If it was just high, I want to take a picture. I had a good time. Great. But it's not that. Then it's all these agenda driven people that all want to do things and they want, they want you to do things for them. They think there's too many people that have been on the podcast, just regular folks and then they get on the podcast and now people know about them and so a lot of people think like, Hey, if I just got on the podcast, that would make my career totally, you know, whether they're a singer or they have a book or this, it just gets too annoying. It's just, it's too overwhelming. But the meet and greet is actually like it's part of your brand, I feel like, like,

Speaker 4:          01:49:24       seriously. Yeah, definitely. It's like when we did, we did the Chicago theater run with Macondo and nate and all those guys. Yeah. Know, just um, I uh, like it. None of the, none of the guys wanted to do meet and greet and I. There was like a thousand people waiting outside the theater and I thought, I just thought, but that's different because that's who I am. Like if I go see a band I am, I am like super compelled to go talk to them and tell them how great I thought they were. Part of that is who I am. And so I went out and did pictures with everyone waiting in the alley at the Chicago theater and I was like. And then when someone goes, dude, you have no idea. I love the podcast. I love Tommy. I love the weight loss. I beat, you know, I love that interaction. I remember one time I was in Scotland and I was like, I just hit it out. Hey, is anyone any fans when you go have a beer with me? And these three guys showed up and it was right when bobcat was on your podcast and we just bullshitted about bobcat appearance. We'd all listen to it. So, you know, I think I, but I don't know what I'd like to maybe charge only like weed out the people that don't want to, you know. Yeah. But see there's the problem,

Speaker 2:          01:50:25       I'm not, I'm philosophically opposed to making people pay for pictures and making people pay to hang out with you. I just don't think it's right.

Speaker 4:          01:50:34       But there should be a way to like just. Yeah, but there's this thin the herd is a thing unless you

Speaker 2:          01:50:39       charged money or pick people. So like there's a company now that does that. They do these vip things and someone brought it up to me and like you could make this. I'm like, I'm not doing it. And they go, but you could make someone stop. I'm not doing it. I mean I used to do it for free forever. I stopped doing it because too many people got too weird. But I'm not going to charge people. I'm just not going to do it. But I know a lot of fucking people that do a lot of people and they make a lot of money doing it. You used to do it right? What the ingredient? Yeah. I used to also feel like, you know, honestly like I, I like meeting people. I a people on the street and meet them when I walk out of the back of the venue. I always, there's people there. I always meet people, but I just don't. I don't, I'm not that good at the meet and greet. I'm just not that comfortable with it. I don't like it that much.

Speaker 4:          01:51:23       The is definitely not. I mean, in not being shitty, but it's not you. You're not like,

Speaker 2:          01:51:28       I'm not very social people that there's, there's people that are demanding and they're like, oh, you don't love your fans because it's not true extra thing from now. No, no, no. Here's the arrangement. The range of Nez. I work hard on my act. I do a lot of sets. I prepare. Take the show very seriously. Uh, come to town. I try to do a kick ass show. That's the arrangement. Thank you. Goodnight. Are Our deals done? And now if you think that you have to tell me some fucking life story for 20 minutes or I'm not your friend. Like, no, this is not the arrangement. This is not like you're demanding too much and you're also not aware of how many other people would want to do the same thing. Like it would be impossible. It's just, it's untenable. You can't do it. There's too many. I would say that for me, like anybody who wants to wait outside that door, I'll meet anybody to. She fucked up. Son shouldn't have said that. That was a mistake that they're not going to wait. They're coming right now. There was one thing. They have a little trailer out there right now. Tom's a

Speaker 4:          01:52:26       or so it's amazing that we're friends because we're so very different. Men. Uh, there was once a comment on his instagram that made me laugh so hard compared to my comments. It was a, Hey Tom, I'm really sorry for looking at you at the airport. They said, I'm sorry. I said, Hi Heidi with the airport. Yeah, but it's just Tom's face just like he is. He's not needy. That's what it is. And so when some guy said, hi Tom on high, and then the guys didn't know what to say, I walked away.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       Ah, he, he came out. I still remember it. I was Atlanta airport. He came over as I was about to take the escalator at, at Hartsfield Jackson and he, he goes, Hey, I'm a big fan. Like, oh hey man. And it was like a quick thing and he was like, big fan. I go, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Got on the son. Never thought twice. And then he wrote, I'm sorry that I bothered you at the airport. And I was like, you didn't bother me at all. It was just, that's just someone who's trying to get a reaction from you. He's not really sorry. And also there was nothing to be sorry for, you know, I felt he was like, he just wants to keep it going. Right. I'm sorry, don't be sorry. Can I hang out with you?

Speaker 4:          01:53:33       Right. But Bert. Yeah. No one would ever apologized. I was at the, I was at the hotel, did Bella tours going on this weekend in San Jose and so it was all fucking fighters. Right. I ran, I ran into Jay big John McCarthy. Oh, okay. The elevator. What a great guy. Great Guy Too. He was like, I knew who he was, but I didn't want to. Like I was afraid I just working out and he was like a. It was like, hi. I just got done working out and I was like, yeah, I wouldn't want to bother me because we have a mutual friend. And I was like, does he know who I am? He was like, Joe Rogan. And I went, I know exactly who the fuck you are. And then, uh, but a big cock speak fellow. No, no, John, that's a different guy. I'm sure John has a big dick to moose kind of fucking the hammer. When did you see Musashi deck in the fucking sauna? You saw his dick, dude. It was legit. Of course he called me about it because I didn't see it

Speaker 3:          01:54:31       fight because the fights on some new streaming thing called dayson that it's called the zone they have. But then the name is with Michael Buffer. It's pretty good. They have a commercial about how dumb. How do you spell it? D, a c, n the zone and it's about. He's joking about. I noticed soon. It's called the zone yet, what's called what? But it's not zone. There's no. Oh Hey man. He can't change how people pronounce things phonetically. That's stupid. So I'm probably made it and it got stuck. Well, a blue saucy just beat the shit out of Rory Macdonald. Stopped him in the second round. I didn't even get a chance to see it because I thought it was going to be on TV and so I went to check my Bella tour on my dvr and it wasn't even there, but he beat him with his Dick.

Speaker 4:          01:55:14       Pick it. I don't know how I got to cut weight without cooking hog on it. Wow. That's. I want to see that footage now. How big? A 10 inches. I'll tell you what it is. It's bigger than this. Fat, fatter than a water bottle. I'll tell you right now. No certain point in time you dick becomes a liability when it's as fat as a water. I don't

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       know what. I don't know how we brought that into the ring with him. Like every girl needs probably unsatisfied. Totally. As soon as they pull it out, they're like, hold on a second, get out of here out. And he's like, he's always one 72. He was weighed one 72 that day because I got on the scale after he did know he weighs more than that. He fights it one 85. He cuts wait to get to one 85. He used to be a light heavyweight champion, so he used to be fighting it maybe a little too. The thing wrong, maybe it looks at the school and I think the scale was off because I said I'm going to say this now that I said that once you weighed one 95 to 30, something could make one 72. He would destroy everyone in the welterweight division. He's a murderer.

Speaker 1:          01:56:25       Is that how you say his name? Big Gardens. Saucy. I thought it was Gerald mean dyslexic person. Nope, I'm dyslexic. So one of the things when I read things, I don't see it right away. He's a monster man. He's one of the big losses for the UFC because in my opinion is one of the top two or 385 pounds in the world at the UFC had beaten Chris Weidman and then he goes over and fights in beltour now, but apparently they just came up with some large cash. They're trying to get big names over there either. I mean, I don't know. I don't know anything about UFC is no hammer me about that, but like do tours really cool. Just being down there. It was like Chael Sonnen, rampage Jackson, like fifty cent was there. It was like a really like, uh, if, if, if you're a passer by failure of mma, then you're like, oh, shut the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       They're doing really good fights. They have big. They have big talent there. Now they have Michael Chandler who's one of the top light weights in the world. Rory Macdonald is one of the best, if not the best welterweight in the world. He's definitely top two or three. He's beaten. Tyron Woodley, who's the UFC champion, who I think is the best rory. They snagged over them right? They snagged him, they have underlay. Silva is that habit vandelays way past his prime and so his rampage, you know those guys, they, they, they're doing the legends tour and rampage just knocked out family, but vandelay doesn't look good anymore and they should let them choose. Let them choose. But you know, they're doing a great job. They're doing a great job. They're really, they're promoting these fights well. They're putting on and the welterweight division they have. Douglas Lema was one of the best in world.

Speaker 1:          01:58:01       They have a Paul Daley who can knock out any living human being. They have Lorenz Larkin. Fifty cent was given away a cash prize. Hazers Trey Whoa. Got into the steam room. Was fifty cent. What does it has to award Bella tour? What does it say? Welterweight Grand Prize winner. A million dollar cash prize. Didn't he just go bankrupt? 50 of this part of a deal he had with the get the strap brand, which I guess he owned, owned and sold. And part of that money is going into this. A million dollars goes to give the person a million dollar cash prize. So the welterweight grand prixs that they had koresh cough, just fought Lima. Those two guys are excellent to Koresh. Cough is another top 10 guy in the world I think. And he's fighting for Bella to Lima, beat him. Lima and rory had a great fight. Rory beat Lima by decision. So there's Rory Douglas, Lema, Paul Daley, and still to this day like Paul Dale, he can knock out anyone.

Speaker 1:          01:58:55       He's so fucking dangerous. A puncher I'll just do is. He's got a left hand that's just a nuclear missile. So. And he just knocked out Lorenz Larkin, who is also a top welterweight. There's so many good fighters over there now. There's so many good fighters in general. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's A. MMA is coming up right now. I mean there's the top talents. This fucking fight this weekend between Mcgregor and Khabib. Gunmen off is going to be crazy. That is a crazy fight. That's Vegas, right? Yup. That is a fucking crazy. Because on that. Yup. I don't know what the fuck's going to happen. Are you excited? Yeah. I don't want to lose that.

Speaker 4:          01:59:32       I wish I wasn't going on this cruise. I would totally hit you up for tickets yet man. I'm super excited. Speaking of which on this, on this bet, this is just. Do you think you can get us free tickets to like so we can take that out of the cash prizes because that would really want to go where I send you free tickets for the UFC. Do you think they do. I think we could leverage you to get us tickets to a boxing match for sure. We can get some tickets as opposed to putting that all except I. That may make the prize right. If it's. If it's like, you know. Right. Right. So

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       maybe I'll get the tickets for the fight. I'll use leverage to get the tickets and then we'll make a big deal that we're going to go and then we'll get like sweets at some hotel somewhere and the loser has to pay for like some extravagant meal. And

Speaker 4:          02:00:19       hold on. We got flights and lodging. I'm going to be on the bat and then. And then

Speaker 1:          02:00:22       private, private jet. That's the way to do it. What are we going to Vegas? Yeah, if it's a. If it's fun, I don't wanna go to Tokyo for some fucking stupid fight. Yeah, let's go private debt. Private jet into Vegas because he's talking about fighting this guy that's not manny Pacquiao in Tokyo. He's not talking about fighting Manny Pacquiao, fight Manny Pacquiao. He's going to fight him in Vegas. That's where the real money is. You're going to end up spending a lot of money. Should we get matching so you think you're going to lose? No, I'm not gonna lose. There's no way to win the whole thing. I think you're going to come in like if it's your fantasy that you come in at the end and you win the whole thing. Cinderella story should work out with me once he killed those fantasies.

Speaker 4:          02:01:03       I want to know. I learned to what you think you're going to get. Do it. I've got a page of numbers right here. Okay. What do you think is going to want to unfriend you now so that you can't see my track? So you should see mine. Yours is scaring me. I know what I have to do now when I go home tonight.

Speaker 1:          02:01:18       So wait, let me understand, what do you think you're going to get? Because I want to know what do you think you're going to get because you're good at calling the shots. So. Well Tom has already achieved more in a day then my first workout. You've already achieved 2:30, you said it was the most

Speaker 4:          02:01:35       most I've ever done in a day is three 83 $80 a day. Yeah. Is that two a day?

Speaker 3:          02:01:39       Yeah. Wow. Actually I'm sorry it's more than that. Three 80 in one workout. But that was. But that was, how did you do that? Seven miles and I did mostly uphill and then I went around and like, so it was a hike run, right. So sustained heart rate for for a long period of time. Oh you guys are fucked. And when I wear this elk hunting so you guys will never get. I'll get $500 a day. Oh, you'll do more than that. Actually. You guys actually going on like top top, top workout or like most single day. Single Day on that day. So you could do, you know, let's say a hike like that or run and then go back and go like, oh I want to get like another 100 points. I'm going to go on this. How long was this battery go for? Long time. Fully charged for a week.

Speaker 3:          02:02:33       Yeah. Really? Yeah. I didn't charge mine for a second time until after I had it for over seven months for all skeptical people. This is not a sponsor. No. We don't know anybody that works at this company and I don't want. We talked about it in text messages. I said we should do this punk rock. I don't want to. We shouldn't do this. We shouldn't have a company sponsor. There's no. We just. This is a good metric. System should product. We're going to use it because of that. And I don't want it. I don't want him to sponsor us. So this is non sponsored. This is. And if it's a piece of shit we're going to get to say it's a piece of shit. Yeah. So just so

Speaker 4:          02:03:07       people fucking with corporate. I like these side effects. I like the part right now. It's like, Oh God, I wish you do sponsor. No, I'll try and John wounds, wounds, Boser will fly me out to pick show song. Yang is a nice place. You know, I do it for real. If they hit me up and then I'd probably. But why would you want to do that? Why would you want to go to? Oh No, it's about the stories I like. I like, I like crazy stuff like that. I think that's a good story is definitely on brand. Most single day workout a gets a new suit.

Speaker 3:          02:03:40       Okay, that's good.

Speaker 4:          02:03:41       And all three of us have to buy them a new suit or you just texted what? What'd you say? How do I register this thing? We got to fucking Pansy. He means he's in. He's in man. Wow. Ari's in two. Okay. Most single day gets to compete, but he doesn't exercise. Oh, you know what's so great. Most single days to shoot and we're going to be in the best shape of our lives so we get a skinny suit that will never be able to wear again.

Speaker 3:          02:04:02       Yeah, we should write. He has to email them for facility code. It's easy. They get it. They'll send it right away. You're right. We should wear suits to the gig. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I've never even had a suit. Alright. Yeah. Well, you know what we'll do. I'll contact David August. Are the guys who make my suits. You suits. Yeah, I know David. August. Yeah. They make awesome suits made. It's got like a little bit of flex to it. So if you're built like a troll like me, he can move around in these things. There's a flex around their belly. Yes. Everything. What's that? Thomas got a suit guy. You got a suit guy? Yeah. But David is. Yeah, he makes conor Mcgregor's when Tom got his fat suit with Chad, Chad Daniels and God and they went and got suits. Does that it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. There was a documentary called I need you to kill that I'm in, which it's on Amazon prime and there's a scene

Speaker 5:          02:05:02       in the documentary where we go and we get a suits made and um, yeah, the, I go with chat and it's really, really fun man. I mean, yeah. I went to the same district that Ari got his maiden and that Guy Danny, I went to Danny. They always have like the names are really sitting there like, did you get yours at Joe's or Danny's like, that's the designers there. Right,

Speaker 4:          02:05:29       so they do a great job, man. First place was for nothing, so I can place a

Speaker 4:          02:05:34       most single day gets a brand new suit. Should we do third place plays, lodging. Fourth place pays for flights and we fly private. I like it. I like that man. Are you going to have to pay for a flight? You're going to play lodging. Yeah. Right. Second place has got to pay for something. What's second place, but I said, well, who's got to pay for whatever? The second dinner. One big nowhere. I don't know. Lodging might be more than dinner. Big Dinner. We could ball the crazier dinner bottles of wine for a thousand bucks. You realize if I'm in, Oh my God, that won't get in panic because I know that I'm going to be wanting to drink it there. I tell you about the dinner I went to Ralphie with. Ralphie may, me and Ralph, he went to dinner with our families. This is one of my favorite stories.

Speaker 4:          02:06:15       We'd been. We'd been partying all weekend. And this is Hawaii? No, this is a Bahamas. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah. But you got to set it up that at the time you're like, middling or just. Yeah, that was a feature act. How many years ago is this a, it's just leanna and his first trip away from Georgia. So it's from our daughter. Ten years plus. It's got to be at least 10, 10, 11 years. You can actually find it if you can. It's on my video because I posted a video at that time. So it's probably 2007 maybe before trial. What happened before I started birth to conquer, I was 37 years old. Thirty six years old at the time. Ralph, he's killing it. He's balling. I'm headlining some maybe for like 1500 bucks. 2,000 bucks. I'm headlining and, but I'm, I'm still featuring at the time. Um, and so maybe I'd done jamison comedy tours.

Speaker 4:          02:07:01       That was. So I had a little bit of money, but not much. No money to speak of, so we go to the do this Gig for Paul and Young Ron and the first night there we go out to eat and it's a huge dinner and I'm like, how much do I owe? And I was like, oh player, you know, I got that Bert Kreischer don't worry about it. You just, you, you only have a great weekend. I said, no, I got to pay for. So I'm like, Nah, don't even read your why when you're wrapping around. Moving around. We May. So we go out that night, everyone goes drinking, we have a great time. The next night we go out to eat, everyone goes out to eat and Ralphie wants again. I go to pay for when he goes, oh, playboy, you know you don't mind is no good around me.

Speaker 4:          02:07:32       Just come on. We didn't have a good time. We go do a show, an amazing fucking show. We'd go out drinking again. Rafi picks up everything. The last night there we go to Sushi at Nobu and Leanne says, you can't live off. He pay. You got to pick up the bill. And I went, okay, so I go over to the lady before before, um, I'm going to screw up numbers, I'll tell you that right now. But I go over to the lady before the bill comes and I go, hey, the big guys not paying, here's my credit card. She's like, okay. So we eat and I drink and we eat and I drink. And was getting like boats, right? Boats. They're just like, wow, you know, I mean they brought out 50 pieces who she, they're like a cool deaton, dolphins and so, and I am doing Saki bomb after Saki bomb and the lady comes with the check and it's like $2,000.

Speaker 4:          02:08:20       I did not have $2,000 and I did not. I didn't have enough money to, for the tip. Like I didn't. I was like, why'd you think you could pay? I didn't know what the bill would be. I don't, I've never paid attention to that stuff. I didn't know what I just. Do you ever eat out? No, but I, I didn't, I wasn't paying attention to what the bill would be. I thought it would be 500 bucks, 600. I didn't know how expensive Sushi at Nobu was that everything is through the roof. She puts the check in front of me and I opened it up and I see it and I, I immediately freeze and leanne goes, how much is it? And just instinctually go fuck you. That's how much it is. And she goes and Ralphie fucking fucking our shit.

Speaker 6:          02:08:59       Gotcha.

Speaker 4:          02:09:04       I. Then I go Ralph Ralph. He goes, don't worry player. We go out and win it back. So I go to our bank machine and I put a thousand dollars and I go over and I put it on black hits red, $3,000 matter of minutes late. Honestly, snipes lied to you. We, Leanne won't speak to me is probably one of the biggest fights we've ever been in. Were fighting in the lobby and I'm hammered. She's mad because you bet the extra money. No, because I said fuck you. That's how much it is. Don't ever talk to me like you're my partner. We're team don't. If I go, I didn't know what to say in the moment. I it was, it was more money than we had at the time that it was probably three weeks on the road for me. Of course. And then you gambled away a thousand. Like a fucking. God said Mickey Mantle. Gene. Yeah. That's not me. That's loop

Speaker 6:          02:09:58       my favorite part of this.

Speaker 4:          02:09:59       It's just like, you know that you got shamed, you know. That's what I love about it. What, what makes you feel good about that? Just say it's my friend doing something stupid. I got to run. Actually I do. We haven't worked this out right now. So we have to bring ren on this. Right? Because he can't, can't have no say he couldn't be here right now. Right now. Okay. Call them up. Yeah. Let's see if he answers. So what's we call at the same time. He's. I know he's answering. Let's see.

Speaker 5:          02:10:35       Stingy. Do you get them dry and got

Speaker 11:         02:10:48       do this fucking stupid thing.

Speaker 4:          02:10:52       Hey, you're on speaker with Joe and Tom. We can all hear you. And we're doing.

Speaker 12:         02:10:59       You do not have consent to use my voice.

Speaker 4:          02:11:06       Hey, we're talking about the bet. Here's what we're thinking. Right? So with these mind zone, a fitness trackers, a joe did 200 today, he's planning on doing two days. So we're thinking the person who gets the most, most calories, most points burnt in a week. It doesn't have to pay for anything out of this challenge. Okay.

Speaker 12:         02:11:26       Running away from

Speaker 4:          02:11:27       everything. Got a murder. My agents now calling shit. No. So the bet is we're going to go away from. We're fighting. We're going to a fight in Las Vegas. Okay? Joe Thinks he can get on your fucking agent. Don't be scared. I don't know how to. There we go. Here we go. First place you'll have to pay for nothing. Second place would have to pay for. We're thinking maybe one meal. Third place will have to pay for lodging. Just let me fucking finish. Third base will play for lodging. Fourth place. Oh, play for

Speaker 12:         02:12:01       we finished. I don't know. I don't know the terms are talking about. So you've given me all the details or something. I don't understand. What you're doing is telling them what you're talking about. And then give me the detail.

Speaker 4:          02:12:12       The person with the most fitness, uh, points points for the month. We'll get in first place the person with the second most fitness points for second place and so on. Now there's a bet going on and the prize is going to a big fight, a big boxing, big boxing match in, in Las Vegas. There you go. Yes. First Place. The person with the most fitness points for the month will not have to pay for one thing. Second place.

Speaker 12:         02:12:39       Begging for change on the corner of Lafayette Gun. No Monica, no pubic hair. Beard. I'm done with all of those.

Speaker 11:         02:12:50       Come on. See? I knew he would turn this into humiliation. We all, we all come on the losers face. So that's part of it.

Speaker 12:         02:12:58       The goblet fire

Speaker 11:         02:13:00       piss combined piss. And I'm eating asparagus.

Speaker 4:          02:13:04       So Ari, are you in? Are you in on the bed?

Speaker 12:         02:13:11       I don't know if we're talking about fruit

Speaker 4:          02:13:14       the weekend. We have to figure out the weekend. It's got to be a weekend. Everyone can go. Yeah, we'll figure it out the weekend. It's uneventful.

Speaker 12:         02:13:22       Tell him this.

Speaker 11:         02:13:23       Yeah, but we're going to be high as fuck it. It'll be fun and tell them this. There's a belt involved. Oh yeah. The winter gets a belt championship belt. Sober October belt

Speaker 11:         02:13:34       and you're going to have to defend it every year. We're having it made and it's going to have pills on it with a line through it. Heroin on it with a line through it. The guy stuck in his own right. A boxing match. Why don't we do something we don't want to do. We can. We were going to go to see floyd mayweather. The rematch. Mandy pack. Yeah. We don't have to do it though, but it'd be fun. Take place. Nine years ago. It would be fun to be in Vegas with like a gentleman. Yeah. We're all together. We don't have to work. We're just all there to. We're going to smoke cigars like a fucking gentleman. When did that happen? I think it takes place sometime in December, but they haven't made the date. They haven't made the date yet. You're in December. You're gone all December. Were you going European? You're up in Israel. What if we go to a a good Bella tour event? Well, I don't have to work. You want to go see a an MMA event?

Speaker 12:         02:14:35       Why are you take off and go see the UFC in the middle of this dance and we'll get high there. We'll do a bunch of heroin this down.

Speaker 11:         02:14:41       I came out. I can't take off one. I'll tell you one thing. We can do one that I don't have to do because I only do the big ones. I don't do the ESPN ones and the. Some of the ESPN ones are going to be really big. I could be in the audience for that. Yeah, let's do. We can do that. Okay. Now we don't have to worry about tickets. Okay. Alright. The fourth place has to play for the flight and we're flying private.

Speaker 11:         02:15:09       Yeah, but just just to Vegas. It's not a lot. If it's Vegas event though, I'm probably going to work at. I'm going to be honest with you. Okay. So it's just we have to be like fucking New York. It's not that much. Yeah. Toronto. We'll have to figure out where it is. So are you the registered look, we'll take care of that already. I sent you an email if you email the email, I just sent you a text message. If you emailed that address, they'll send you a facility code right away. Some messaging. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It'll. It'll just sink. Sent an email to support at. I sent you all the details to say I need a facility code. Did you buy yours on Amazon? Yeah, me too. Yeah, they didn't send me an facility code. Are you in for a tiered financial bet for a UFC event or joe doesn't have to work and

Speaker 12:         02:16:03       humiliation.

Speaker 11:         02:16:06       Okay, let's. You know what? Let's find it. Let's find a sweet little spot of humiliation in this for the last place. Last place has got. There's a punishment involved. Got Drank piss. Everybody's pissed. Oh No, no, no, no goblet. Oh No. I know what you guys are fucking friends. Tommy. They're like straight from the tap, like a Yeti Tumbler. Let's keep it warm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. We're not really jre. Tumbler. Embow. We'll rewrite the pis champion on it. This right here. We'll keep it. Always keep it on this table, so we'll know that the person drank the other people's pissed. I'd be like, fucking forrest gump this month. Why don't you guys just come on my back. That fear factor? I'll drink a gallon of piss. Right? You're not going to have to be the one drinking piss. Wouldn't either. Tom or Ari. I'm worried about my friend Ari. He doesn't believe that you could ever possibly witness this. There's no way birtle even coming fucking third there. No Way. What do you think of this? Sorry.

Speaker 12:         02:17:09       Really for sure. What? You're going to a days and.

Speaker 11:         02:17:15       But what about, what about burt's Mickey Mantle Gene?

Speaker 12:         02:17:20       Uh, that would help them. Or you're on the road a lot or no?

Speaker 11:         02:17:23       Yeah, I'm on a cruise next year.

Speaker 12:         02:17:26       Oh, that's good. You can run on a boat. I'm going to.

Speaker 11:         02:17:29       I'm trying to get burt to die. Trying to keep up with me. It is. I'm doing four days. Good luck.

Speaker 12:         02:17:36       Yeah, you're afforded. Okay. Their corresponding. Here's the important thing. Let's see. Something that we can all get behind. What? What, what are you afraid of August. The only problem with that is when we got scheduled.

Speaker 11:         02:17:52       That's fine. That's fine. To do that though. We can do that out and then we'll add. We will come up with a and maybe this will be fun. We'll have a very tasteful yet meaningful punishment for final for last place. Well tasteful. You just. You're at a [inaudible] wheelhouse. Well, he wants to be humiliating. Frozen hot dog up your asshole. That's what he's talking about. He thought thought is too slippery and break out.

Speaker 12:         02:18:18       We up until the end of April until the innovative problem. I really don't have any weeks open.

Speaker 11:         02:18:23       Well, we could certainly do something at the end of April. We could figure it out. Look, yeah, we'll figure that part of it out. But you're in right? You're in on the bed? Yeah. Okay, so wait, what's the. The Bat, his first place pays for nothing. Second place pays for a meal. Third place pays for lodging and fourth place pays for a private jet.

Speaker 12:         02:18:53       Private jet. What the fuck is wrong with you?

Speaker 11:         02:18:55       You're in, you're in, you're in what's wrong, but that's part of what's humiliating. Just don't pay so much money. Just don't come in fourth. Don't come in for it. Enjoyed those long walks in the east village. Yeah, those will definitely make you win four years. No, I don't want to drive it yet. What are you talking about? Shut up. Really interesting to bed on. How about a helicopter money related. It's cruise ship. Winnebago across the country. Why it got to be money related?

Speaker 12:         02:19:29       Well, it just doesn't do anything.

Speaker 11:         02:19:32       Makes you feel terrible, but we're all like. The whole thing is that we're having fun together and it's not supposed to be like really wants you to suffer. He wants you to drink is piss and where's pubes on your face? You got to get the names of the. Of the three winters tattooed on your left, on your right hand, on the inside palm of your right hand. I'm not into that. Yeah, but I do like the belt. I do like the fact that it's great. We have to defend them.

Speaker 12:         02:20:02       Bell, Michael Bell, Jr. Srovio a moving trophy every year.

Speaker 11:         02:20:07       KirSten, who has the belt, whoever wins, they get to keep it in their house and make videos. It's very motivated. Any idea, all the social media or this social media points, you can get stand in front of that belt, letting everybody know and tom will finally have a belt of fits him. So keep going.

Speaker 12:         02:20:32       So this is, this has nothing to do.

Speaker 11:         02:20:35       So it's not about how many calories you burn, it's just about these weird points that this thing made, which is basically related to effort. It's like effort points. Yeah, it's a good. It's a good system.

Speaker 7:          02:20:46       Yeah,

Speaker 11:         02:20:47       you're incorrect. Are you, by the way, by the way?

Speaker 12:         02:20:50       I don't, I don't have any interest in going out to vegas to go to la to get a private jet to then go to vegas with you guys.

Speaker 11:         02:20:56       Okay. What do you want to do? What do you think it should be?

Speaker 12:         02:21:00       Uh, some sort of humiliating thing or the rest of it. But liKe I would probably meet you guys in vegas. Wouldn't go to la then go to vega.

Speaker 11:         02:21:07       Tommy bonds has to leave. We'll we'll sort this out, but for sure there'll be a belt involved for sure.

Speaker 12:         02:21:14       Begging, begging for money on three, not monica. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:21:19       Yeah. It's boring to us already. How about this? Can you agree on this tiered structure? If we find an event that you are comfortable and really excited about? Yeah, I'll do an event to go to. It doesn't have to be. I mean, I think you have seen will be fun. I've never seen the ufc fight, but a tiered tiered structure of of punishment. Meaning for the bottom three, a humiliation for number four. Belt for the winter. Single day. By the way, single day a calorie burn and the person with the most points for one single day. That person gets a brand new suit that all people have to pay for it.

Speaker 12:         02:21:54       what suit? Yeah. From Hong Kong to make it?

Speaker 11:         02:21:59       No, we're going to get david august to do it. Only the guy who makes suits for conor mcgregor and me.

Speaker 12:         02:22:07       Yeah. Okay. That made sense from outside tom. Really? So we only make smalls. Did he really just joking. He's going to rap like 70 years. No, I don't think trump will get make seats for putin.

Speaker 11:         02:22:27       Maybe we'll know kim jones guy by the end of this.

Speaker 12:         02:22:31       Yeah, like a soon we can make for this event, but honestly it's just to only forgive me, but you kind of go on this until probably may.

Speaker 11:         02:22:40       Yeah, but that'd be. That'd be fine because we'll have a belt. Yeah, the winter. Get to parade around birds. Birds already got the belt sitting on a shelf. He's planning his little instagram stories in front of the belt. I can't wait

Speaker 12:         02:22:58       for sure. Losing us.

Speaker 11:         02:23:02       Listen man, you got a lot of resolve. I saw how you manned up for the fucking yoga challenge. You might man up. By the way. I'm doing the yoga challenge too. I'm doing both things.

Every single day, most points suit and we can add humiliation per like meaning like if we come up with something during the month that we all think is hilarious, texted to each other, we put it out on social media and we hold ourselves to that too.

Speaker 11:         02:26:04       I don't think it's gonna. Be epic from actor to do this and then have nine months later because there'll be a belt. If burt winds will never hear the end of it.

Speaker 4:          02:26:54       I would do it in a heartbeat. I would do that for a video. I just do it for. I don't care about begging for money. I don't think he finds it enticing.

Speaker 11:         02:27:01       Oh, right. Yeah, I get it.

Speaker 4:          02:27:04       Okay, well, we'll figure it out. We'll figure the tiered structure will make it to the second place. Doesn't play as much as third place. That doesn't pay as much.

Speaker 11:         02:27:12       Fortunately the way we can be joe rogan that. Would that be possible?

Speaker 4:          02:27:16       I'm definitely going to that by the way. I just made eye contact with me and I averted my eyes. He looked at me like, are you fucking serious? I'm so excited about that.

Speaker 11:         02:27:26       This joke, I don't believe in a lap. Probably two of us, maybe three to double our points. I might take the whole month off comedy on my workout day and night. I might just want to. I want to see what my body can do. I might just go really crazy. See what happens. I got a lot of machines here too. I'm the only one of us that has a full gym.

They'll email you and me immediately and if you need it was they got the message and that was it? No. Did you send it to the support? The email that I just sat in a text message? Yeah. That's what was on the thing. They didn't say. Well they'll, they'll send them to you quickly. Um, when they're going to hear about this. First of all they're gonna hear about this and they're probably gonna email you quicker. Um, but if you have any ideas about the design of the belt, feel free to chime in there too because we got an order that soon because it takes like three to four weeks. Oh, okay. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:30:42       I think it'd be cool to have each of our faceS as one of the side things with our, with our thing that is hard. It's like you have a joint in your mouth. I have a tito's and my face already has dick in his mouth and tom is a piece of cake.

Speaker 11:         02:30:59       We'll figure it out. Alright. Alright. We'll figure it out. Alright. Love you. Nice

Speaker 4:          02:31:09       crazy car. So fucking excited for this. It's going to be fun. Dude. I need these things in my life for some reason I don't like. I'm not, I can't motivate unless I have like a goal. It's serious motivation. You know? What else this, you know, I was a skeptical

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       when I first thought about this, but then in using the app while you're using the app, it's showing you your actual numbers while you're doing it and when you're, when you're, when you're in the middle of it, like you're seeing the actual numbers take place. Really? Yeah. My friend request. I didn't know if I got it. I know novick notifications on.

Speaker 4:          02:31:38       I just questioned you and tom. Okay. I'll, I'll go. What should we accept? Other people should know? Just the three of us. Four of us want to live your life like that. I don't. I thought it kind of is going to be fun. It's going to be really going to be a good one. I wonder how much weight we are going to lose.

Speaker 1:          02:31:55       I'm like one 97 [inaudible] 98 right now. I think I'm going to get down below one 90,

Speaker 4:          02:31:59       do body measurements because I think that's like I did chest across the nipples, belly across the belly button, waste and then biceps, calves and thighs. I'll tell you all my exact measurements right now. I think. I just think it was accurate. My blood pressure today was my doctor calling about my blood pressure today to figure out jesus will know because when I do sober october go so low. Is that bad? No, it's good, but I'm on medication. He wants to kind of watch my medication so that if I. What do you want? Losartan and a or some another thing. Jesus on that shit because I have high blood pressure. one 2,995. Was it today,

Speaker 1:          02:32:35       but is that a natural thing that you have? High blood pressure is because of drinking.

Speaker 4:          02:32:40       I think it's probably lifestyle induced and things from being overweight and probably from drinking but some bad thing yet. But they got you on pills? Yeah, but I not good. You have. It's better than a stroke. Like I think me being proactive and getting encino cardiologist these past five years has been the best thing that ever happened to me because there are significant side effects to a lot of those things. Really? Yeah. You gotta look into that stuff. I'd like to get off the pills all together. I'd like to get down. I would like to. I mean we talked about it jokingly, but I'd like to get below two. Oh five. You can do that and keep it there.

Speaker 1:          02:33:14       Listen man. When you got to to 20 or you get two to 16. You said that she ended sober october. Why? What's to stop you from losing 11 more pounds. You can do that. You think about what fighters do. How about my friend cam hanes, when he was getting down to run 240 miles, he wanted to get down to 169 or below. So you know what he did? He ate 2000 calories, burned off three. Just kept doing it every day. Send 10 people say they can't lose weight. I go, oh, you can. You just got to be willing to do with the people that actually lose weight too.

Speaker 4:          02:33:45       If you're hungry all the time, losing weight, it's hard. [inaudible], I don't have what? How I lose weight is not the healthy way. You crash. I go, fuck it. Let's drop calories below a thousand.

Speaker 1:          02:33:58       RIght? Bro. Can't do that because we actually discussed this on a podcast very recently. The problem is your metabolism crashes as well and your body goes into this famine mode and he wants to protect calories, so anything you do eat, you gain back much quicker and then it's far more difficult for you to lose again because your body has a mechanism in place to protect because your body thinks it's, you know, we have to hold onto these calories. It slows You down. You're, we're talking like one of the guys, layne norton who's a, uh, he was involved in bodybuilding and he was saying that his blinking was slower. He was blinking slower because it's shredding. Getting down to like low body weight. Yeah. His metabolism crashed so hard that he was literally blinking and thinking slower and thinking is for you. For comics, terrible to be thinking slower when you're on stage as the last thing you want, you know, if you just work out like a fucking maniac and eat healthy, just cut out the sugar and the fat and all the bullshit your body will slim down was just going to go clean.

Speaker 1:          02:34:59       I heard of, I had a nutritionist talk me through how they eat, what they say. Uh, well the thing that. Here's the thing I always had a problem with. She was like, you need to eat before you work out. You need a little bit about meal, but you need some energy for your workout. You don't necessarily have fast cardio all the time. I thought, well that's what I've been doing the 16 hour fast. She might be old school, but if there's a lot of people that are nutrition and the science behind athletic performance has changed so much over the last five, 10 Years. This not, you know, just talking to some random nutritionist might not be the best person to talk to. They might not be. I don't, I don't want to say because I don't know her, but she might not be on the ball.

Speaker 1:          02:35:36       She, I, I just, I feel like I had so much information. Especially when you listen to this podcast, you get so much information. Zach bitters, like you got to go fatty meats and then and then and then you hear Jordan peterson's daughter saying that all these people and then you go, oh no, very specific situation. She hAs severe autoimmune immune issues, severe. She's most likely, according to other nutritionist that I've talked to, she's probably got some gut bacteria issue that she needs to get her gut biome sorted out. It's all so above my pay grade, quite honestly. I mean I get interested in this stuff and I talk about and there's some things that I could say with certain amount of certainty, but not really what you should and shouldn't do in terms of each individual person in their diet. I would say if I was you, what I would get down to is I would say definitely start eating a lot of vegetables.

Speaker 1:          02:36:27       There's a. That's pretty much universal. Everybody agrees except these crazy carnivore people, but I think their situation is like either an elimination diet or a calorie restricted diet, which is not really the best for performance, I don't think for the kind of shit you're trying to do. Yeah. I think broccoli, kale, spinach, all that stuff, sauteed, all that stuff's fantastic for you. Then on top of that mean obviously I eat red meat. I'm a big fan of red meat. I think you should eat just like very nutrient dense meet and I think you should take multivitamins just to cover all your bases. You know, there's a bunch of like really good green supplements that you can add to water or you know, little packets you could take out your calories. No. So you just eat until you're full. Yeah. Really? Yeah. How many calorIes do you think you need a day?

Speaker 1:          02:37:13       I really don't know. If you had to guess what's elc? Elc is pretty lean. Yeah. It's pretty lean and you looks like you're eating maybe eight ounces elk. I probably eat a pound of that a day for sure. At least. Yeah. I mean, I shoot when you're 400 pounds of meat. I have some for you if you want. I definitely do. I got a bunch of sausage, elk sausage. Just sensational. Really love it. You'll love it. A ton of it, man. I'm definitely up for that. Yeah. Okay. I've got a bunch in the back. Okay. I got these freezer bags too. We can take it home with um, well I would say just cut out the sugar and the bread and the pasta and if you just do that you'll lose a ton of weight. You lose a ton of weight. Just doing that. I'm in.

Speaker 1:          02:37:52       This one's going to be fucking awesome. Yeah man. Just vegetables. Just eat a, you know, get yourself a fucking big bowl of broccolini and cook it with butter and olive oil and put garlic salt on it. It's healthy. It feels good when you eat it, your body responds weLl to it. You know, just only good nutrients meant and just realize you're going to have to get a lot of rest and you're going out to drink a shit ton of water because you're going to be keeping up with some terrifying numbers were going hard this month per days, man. Thirty one days. Yeah, the end. Ben. Oof. I'm going to fucking look a megan jack shredded. You're going to be like skinny bert like from that photo and maybe maybe I'll do trt to, to view when do you know how you should do trt? Would you ever get your hormones tested but tested?

Speaker 1:          02:38:43       Should get them tested, is to find out where you're at. It'll help everything. Helps your immune system. Helps your energy levels really helps your concentration. Yeah. It's literally enhancing place. You can get t dot. Well you don't. You got to do it. Look at that picture. Yeah, that's my 40th birthday, my 40th birthday. Slender face. See right there. You are like five pounds from being shredded. If you have right there and you lost five pounds, you'd have a six pack that I did the cus. I lost that weight in 19 days. Wow. See, the problem is when you do that, the yo yo, your crap. Why is a picture of me shirtless? Right under burt's picture. That's me when I was like 26. Oh my god, it's me on newsradio 20, 27 sexy pitch. Um, what? So yeah, the problem is losing the, losing the weight, like a crash.

Speaker 1:          02:39:39       The problem with the crash is see if you lose the weight over the month because you're just burning it off like a madman, but you're eating a lot. Your body's not going to be in famine mode. Your body is going to be more efficient. It's going to need more cows and you definitely should lift weights. That's one thing you should do over this. And lifting weights will also add to this I, my, my plan is lifting weights, kickboxing, running hills, yoga, and then Various cardio machines from the versa climber to the rower, to the echo bike. I'm going to rotate them all so I can keep doing all of them so I can do different ones. I got the rower

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       in my house, I got the assault air fitness trainer. Don't deny yourself any food though. Just fucking pound food, pound food all the time because you're just going to be. YOu're going to be so hungry. All right. I think, yeah, if I. If I do, if I figured if I do two days and then and just go, I know what I got to get a day. Yeah. Yeah. It just keep going. Yeah, it's going to be great for all of us. It Was. I was thinking about that today when I was a. When I was working on, I was like, wow, this is a very. When you looking at the numbers on that thing, it's very motivational. You know? It's funny, when before when I was in college, I ran and what was really fun, the stuff these rudders journals is to get done your run and write them in tracking your fitness.

Speaker 4:          02:40:58       Tracking your workout is. It's really fun to look at numbers and stack up. It's almost like it feels like some, like almost like a hoarder's vibe or like an ocd vibe. Yeah, it's definitely better. Like when it's on this app than it is if you just know you're worked out. Yeah. I used to. When I used to, when fitbit first came out, I used to get. I had to get to 12,000 steps every day and I would, I would land from a flight, get up to my hotel room, open a bottle of wine and just start dancing. Fucking weird as fuck. Like if someone came and complained, I, they would think I was on meth. Yeah, it's, it feels good. It feels good to set goals I might have, but I always tell people like one of the best ways to get things done is to write things down.

Speaker 4:          02:41:40       It is, it's such a huge motivating factor. Like you have a list of shit that you have to do today and check those bitches off and then at the end of the day you feel good. Like you go to bed, you feel good. I checked off all those things on my list. I'm better now. I feel better than I was before. Yeah. My wife's a big list maker. Huge. When you make a list, it really does organize your day like I will when I was shooting, shooting the promo thing for my tour next week and I shot at this weekend in san jose and uh, and I was like, I had all these different things I needed to do and my wife's like, make a fucking list. And I went, oh yeah, yeah. So I wrote down all the shots I needed that I'd feel like I didn't feel like I didn't get the night before and then just banged it out and I was like, wow, that was fucking easy as shit.

Speaker 4:          02:42:20       Yeah, it's so much better than like trying to remember what else, what else do I need to do? And then like half ass in it. You knoW what you did. That's very impressive. You came up with a new hour pretty fucking quick. Like how long did it take you to come up with a new hour? Uh, I came up with it. I've, I don't know, maybe like a february, march, april, may, june, six months. What did you do to ramp up your writing? A super aware. So my biggest thing for me, which I think helped me back, and I've, I've talked about this a lot, maybe a lot, but when you were in production brain, you didn't have room for comedy brain. Like when I was making a tv show I never did another room for comedy and so I might be obsessed with football so there might be something wrong with me, but when I'm in comedy brain and which is when I'm.

Speaker 4:          02:43:06       When I'm doing a special, it's focused on only that material, like only the material. But when I docked on the special I just went up and was like, here. It was the most enjoyable time in my life. It's like everything was a bit just walking around. I was looking for things and just being inspired by the littlest thing even to this day, but it's part of the reason I like to go over to New York and do podcasts and fuck around. I was on anthony humanist podcasts. I came up with two bits in the moment that I was like, do those, those are going to new environment and new feeling your brain firing and done. Not denying myself the opportunity of a bit because a bit is silly or goofy or hacky in my head. I go, that's okay, let's keep working that. And so, um, I have right now I have like 55 minutes that I'm, that I feel is really solid, but the goal now sort of like we were talking to tom was talking about untangling it is like weaving it in.

Speaker 4:          02:43:57       So that one that follows the other one. So right now I'm playing with these bits, putting them in different places, trying to figure out what could follow a bit. That's the funnest part also. Right. And then once I do that and once I have no what I'm doing, my next vessel, that's what it almost becomes less fun for me. It's like I don't want to go to the store because I don't want to write new bits, but like in this salad days or when you're just all writing, I loved that shit. Just going up on stage and going in la and be like, I bought a gun and just go and just feeling the energy and being like, oh, I'm in, I'm in it. I don't know where this is going. I could lose them. Right, right. So I wouldn't buy numbing, joking. I went and bought a gun because I thought it wouldn't be a good bit when I went and said, did you say that on stage?

Speaker 4:          02:44:39       No, yoU should, but that should be part of the bet. Are you serious? Yeah. Fuck yeah, fucking done. I bought a gun because they thought it'd be a good bet. I was driving out in burbank and I was like, oh, this gun talk. And I was like, I don't have any gun material. Was like I should buy a gun. And I was like, have a real gun nut on your podcast to talk to you about guns. I should, you know, she can't get on a colion noir either. That guy follow that guy on youtube. He was on my podcast. Good guy. Yeah, he's great. Yeah. Was. Oh yeah, yeah. Fucking I'm going to. I'm going to be like the progressive guy that makes it seem like there's something wrong that you're pointing it out. Yes. He happens to be an african american. No, but in that culture you have to bring it up in that culture that is so interesting that they.

Speaker 4:          02:45:17       It's almost like a. I feel like when he had a mr mike on magic. Mike, not magic mike. Killer killer mike on. It was really cool to hear this through mike magic. Mike was here, they're white guy. Mike. It was cool to hear their perspective on it, you know, Because culturally you always see a company, the nra come from this like whIte redneck thing. No, he's. well, you know, he makes real good points. I mean, he wasn't a lawyer. He was a lawyer. Right? I'm pretty sure it was like he was. Yeah. But he makes really good points in terms of like a personal safety and responsibility. The thing about like, people equate nra with mass shootings and all kinds of other crazy shit, which is not really totally fair because no nra member has ever committed a mass shooting. you know, whenever something happens, they think, oh, this is all because these people want the other people that have access to these kinds of guns.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       The real connection, as always an ad nauseum. I've talked about this too much, is psychotropic drugs. Those people are almost all on some sort of psych medicine. All of them. Yeah. The is a ca. Is it causation or correlation? That's the problem. Is the psychotropic drugs cause causing them to do this or are they on psychotropic drugs because they're crazy and they shouldn't haVe a gun anyway and it should be more difficult. I'm I'm 100 percent. I'm in believed that you should test people and that there should be some sort of standards in terms of mental health in terms of Whether or not you've committed assault, whether or not like those kinds of things, whether or not you have a history of mental illness, whether or not you have a history of lashing out or violent outbursts. Yeah. Those kind of people shouldn't have guns that the kind of people that think everybody shouLd have access to a gun, I think that's a little irresponsible, but the kind of people that think no one should have a gun, I think that's irresponsible to scratch crazy talk. I mean, it's not going to happen in our country. No, not in this one. No, but you should haVe him on men or or there's other gun nuts. I could turn you onto my friend. Justin's legit gun nut. Just met him just in college. He's been on my podcast for. He's a legiT giant. He's like seven feet tall, but he's a real gun nut. He's. He lives in vegas. He has so many guns. Doesn't know how many guns. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:47:26       Well, no, no. Stay. I'm thinking of the. The, the fighter. Frank mir is a big gun guy.

Speaker 1:          02:47:30       Giant gun guy. Frank mir strapped everywhere. He goes. He's got like one in his ankle. One up his ass.

Speaker 4:          02:47:36       Frank, here's a really interesting guy. Smart dude. He did my this. There's something about cage fighters were there. Is there, is there a very direct and they say what they mean and they mean what they say. Tate was the first person that I ever ran into that was like that. He texted me and I didn't text back and he texted again and then he texted, hey man, I'm starting to get feelings about this. Text me back. And then I was like, well yeah, frank meir said he came to my podcast, we had a cigar while we're doing the podcast and he's just like, I'm such and maybe I'm such in this weird bullshit hollywood world where people don't mean what they say that I, I'm used to that. And he goes, uh, that was a really great cigar. We should do this. We should have another one. I Was like, okay. And he's like, well, what are you doing it like eight tonight? And I was like, I'm here. And he was like, I'm going to do a podcast so I have another cigar. I was like, okay. I sure I didn't think I'd ever seen him again. He showed back up at 7:55. He was like, you ready for that car? And we went in my back yard. We spoke to another cigar, just talked. It was like he fucked.

Speaker 1:          02:48:32       okay. It's fine. It's being sincere as an oddity. Yeah. This is the world of acting. That's what it is. You around this world of auditions and actors and producers and exactly this strange land we live in, man,

Speaker 4:          02:48:49       this right here. This shit happens in other places, but it just is very prevalent here. Like where people just aren't genuine and they're not honest. You put this like

Speaker 1:          02:48:58       people just lick their finger and stick it out in the wind trying to figure out which way the wind's blowing and that's the way they go. Like because everybody just wants everybody to like them out here. Everyone's auditioning for things. It's just such a strange place, man.

Speaker 4:          02:49:11       I saw my buddy eddie is a like a man, you know the cuban from Florida. Bill fist fight his fucking chair. You know, just a regular guy. That means maxwell. Man. He came out the first time he came out, there was a comic, I won't say his name, who was holding court at the hollywood improv and he was making fun of me like as the joke, everyone was laughing and I was laughing and my buddy eddie just kind of looked sideways and we got in the car and he goes, why why'd you let that happen? I go, he's, he's super famous. I mean, you know, it's like whatever. He was not man, now he's, he's smaller than you. Why don't you just fucking knock them out? And I go, that's not how it works out here. He goes, yeah, it is. It is. It does let them say that shit to me. That's how it works. I go, no, I understand. Yeah. I was just knocking about and he was like, dude, I don't like that disrespectful shit. I was like, well, it's different out here at. He goes, no, it's not your, it's different cause you're letting it be different. Well, it depends on how close you are with the guy because if you're really good

Speaker 1:          02:50:08       close with the guy and he's saying funny things and you think they're funny and you laughing sincerely, like we bust on each other all the time. Yeah. But it's not disrespectful. It's just hilarious. It's just, I think it's, I think everyone knows that we're all close friends and that's our, it's our language. But there are people who are not your close friends who was like, you look at bird over there with blah blah, blah, and then they'll start fucking with you. And nick gets a little slippery and grow.

Speaker 4:          02:50:33       It's a. especially, there's, there's uh, it's narcissism. It's guys who Built it. They just, they think they'll alfia yeah. And it's funny. I, I definitely have changed from that. When you know, when you're young and you're hungry in this business and you want to succeed, you don't want to tell a famous guy that might be able to give you work him and don't talk to me like that because then you almost like blackball yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:50:53       Right? Well, you've had some bad experiences and we don't need to mention any names that you had some bad experiences with a particular comedian that was like that where, you know, we've talked about it. There's, there's mental mentally ill people that are in this business too, you know, there's that.

Speaker 4:          02:51:10       It's tough. Yeah. I feel like, uh, I feel like sometimes I draw them in. It's taught to stand up. Nice. Yeah. And I, and I, and I'm, I, I, I'll say this about myself, but I'm very creative and I like to fuck around. I like to, you know, and I think some people see that as a weakness. I, I'm, there's someone that I'm told you privately that stole from me, that was a friend separate and it, I, man, that fucking makes me angry because I go, I remember when it happened and I had already dealt with something else that was similar to that. I remember I was at my wife's lake house when someone texted me and said, hey man, did you give that job to that person? And I was like, no man, it pulled this fucking thing in my. In my head. That was like, I remember thinking, did you, do you think I'm weak?

Speaker 4:          02:51:54       Do you think I won't say anything. Do you think? Do you think that you can do that to me? right. And, and I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything because I learned the first time around that it really almost like all these that come out about sexual assault. It doesn't, it doesn't benefit you to coMe out and say that someone stole joke from you. You just equate still. I know, I know, but no, but it's coming. It's that coming forward thing where when you look at these women and said there's no benefit and go, people go, oh bitches. I go, no, theY don't. There's not a lot of benefit to go and say you've been raped because now you've got to fucking. That's what you're defined as and, and you. And You've got to defend yourself from something you didn't do to yourself. and so when you get stolen from them, obviously that is a stretch of an equivalent person. But to come out and defend yourself, people do start attackIng. You go, why would you even say anything to? You're just, you're just jealous.

Speaker 1:          02:52:41       Pull yourself out on a limb. If you're talking about someone taking something like a joke for me too, because you have. You have to hope that people side with you. So like say if some famous person steal something from you, you have to hope when you come out that, that they're not a bunch of people going to jump on his side and attacked you, which is totally possible. And if tHey do then you're fucked and you're out on a limb.

Speaker 4:          02:53:03       Dude, I went through, I went through and I screen grabbed everything. That was proof. unequivocably screen grabbed everything.

Speaker 1:          02:53:10       Fuck them. Yeah, I got everything. Yeah. Oh no. said I'll never do anything with it. But you know what man? The good lesson is now that person you Could write off forever. It's like, what was the goodfellas? What was it? What was the movie like? You got off light. Like now you know the for $20 or $200, whatever it is. Now that person never has talked to you again. Yeah, he good. You know you sometimes it's sometimes when someone does something like that, you're like, okay, now I can write you off

Speaker 4:          02:53:42       and in and write them off in a very interesting way as a comic to know, oh, you never had it. You never will. You don't got what I have. I can make more of that shit. That's what I do for a living. Oh, you, oh my god. So when you really don't have any material and you don't know how to write, you don't know how to write new material. Oh, shut the fuck up. So that's what you can't do. Oh, suck a dick.

Speaker 1:          02:54:02       There's two. There's two different types of mindsets. The type of mindset where someone like steals someone else's ideas and tries to pass them off as their own is kind of the opposite mindset as to someone who's creative. Because when you're creative, you're thinking about a bit and you're not thinking about yourself and how the bid is going to work for you and how it's going to kill when you get out there, but when you're stealing, if something like say if you have a bit about lollipops and I go, oh, I wish that was my bit. I'm going to steal that lollipop bit, that pitt's going to kill, and then I do that lollipop it and it crushes and I call. I feel so good when I do that lollipop pit, they get addicted to it. That's one of the things about people that get called out for bits and they say, I'm not going to do it anymore, and then I already did that bit at the laugh factory here because they get addicted to get addicted to the reaction. That bit gets. See there, you're addicted to coming up with new stuff like an I am and the people that are trying to be creative. What you're trying to do is you have. You're trying to like summon

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       these ideas out of the ether. You're trying to pull them out of the air and then once you have them like, okay, I got it in a bottle, I got it in a bottle, okay, now I've got to add things to it. I've got to bring it alive. I gotta fucking frankenstein and it's alive, and then one day, months and months later you trot that bid out of the improvident fucking crushes and that is one of the most amazing feelings. Like someone like sam tripoli or bill burke come up and go, dude, I love that. And just go like, it's working. I got it. It's pumping. We all. We all love that about each other too. I love when someone's got a new bit. I think it was that new. What has that been like? Oh dude, your last hour that comes out tonIght at midnight. I remember watching you run it in the or at the.

Speaker 2:          02:55:47       At its infancy probably like eight months ago. Right when I was getting ready to in february when I was getting ready to tape my special, I saw you doing yours and I was like, oh shit. Is this your new material? And you're like, yeah, I'm getting ready to film and you know, a couple of months. And I was like, oh, like dude, that's the greatest feeling when you sit as a comic in the back and you watch your friends just fucking murderer. It's inspires you with shit you haven't heard. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's the best. But people that still will never get that. They will never get it. They're missing that. The, it's sad. It's a sad thing because they're always going to have to live this weird lie. You know, he does weird lie of creativity because creativity is so slippery and you can't be thinking about yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:56:30       That's not what it's about. It's the opposite about that. It's all about the idea. It's all about how it gets to the people. It's all about how it works. Like you have to like take yourself literally out of the equation. But the people still there, it's all about them. It's all about them getting a good feeling, doing someone else's bit. And I really think that that is. There's this weird balance to the world and I think when when you do that, I think it takes away from your ability to do the other thing takes away from your ability to be creative. I would almost argue I'm the exact opposite. When it gets up and running and murderous. I almost feel like I'm lying to the audience. Like I'm cheating going, going like, you know, it works. I've been doing it too long. I have a hard time doing sets of the store when I'm.

Speaker 2:          02:57:12       When I got my hour ready, I go, what am I doing going there for? I'm going to. I'm still in a spot from someone who couldn't use it and I'm just going up with shit that works. Like, oh, come on bert. Yeah, but you're giving the audience a good time and you're keeping everything sharp. That's the other thing, like once a bit is done, it's you can't just leave it alone because like if I had to today go up and do my bruce jenner bit, wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know how to do it. Haven't done it in two years. I literally wouldn't be able to do it is one of my best bits ever and I wouldn't. I wouldn't know where to start. I would have to go back, listen to it, and then I would have to go do it a bunch of times. It's get it polished. It's really fun though. When someone calls out a joke that you haven't told in years and you're like, I did it this past week. I do. I do an hour, 25 minutes, show our 20th show where I do my new hour and then at the end of whatever bits want to hear, I'll tell

Speaker 4:          02:58:02       you that's nice and a two man show. So you have someone do 15 minutes and I do the rest and that way I feel like people definitely want to hear flying dildos are the machine or someone called out a mexican kid in the elevator and I was like, whoa, I haven't done that since my first special comments. I do it. I didn't. And so I started doing it and I was like, and I was, and I just kinda, you're my muscle memory goes back in and then you're like, and you're so much better of a comedian now that the things that you would have never said back then, she didn't know how to do it. You just start adding ad libs in and it just kills. And you're like, shit man.

Speaker 1:          02:58:37       I had a guy come on stage once. He asked me to do a bit. I go, I don't remember how to do a bed. He goes, I do. I go, get up, you're a bitch. That stage. And I had him kind of do the bed. I go, yeah, I remember that part. Okay, okay. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:58:50       I saw some guy on instagram, uh, did he goes, uh, he was doing my machine bit as a joke, like he's an open mic or is this maybe it's 10 time on stage or whatever. And his friends, I guess her fans. And he was like, when I was 22 I got involved with the restroom, my machine, or with the russian mafia, here's how it happened. And they all started laughing and he goes, I'm just kidding. I ain't doing that shit. But it made me giggle because he missed. He misspoke. It's not the way I say it. I, I got, I got in a scuffle with the russian mafia or something and it made me giggle. Hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird

Speaker 1:          02:59:23       how people interpret your. Like when you do something and then people really like it and they take it and they make a clip about it or something, or they add something to it or they. One of the weirder things has been the animated shit that people do. Yeah. You know, she's just like, you go. You were talking about this the other day that when you're in this room and you're doing this podcast, it just seems like you and me are talking. That's one of the reasons why it works, or you and me and whoever else is here, but the people that hear it, you're the actual numbers that you're dealing with. You're dealing with millions of people like that doesn't seem to register in your head. And then you'll see these clips and you see like these memes and you'll see like these videos and ucf, these animated shorts and you see people do impressions of you and you're like, wait, what? What the fuck is that? It takes. And then You'll see people get tattoos of your face on their ass or something like that. Like on your calf. They get you smiling, your beard and you're on theIr calf and you're like, what the fuck? The machine, it'll take. Like I saw a dude who have that russian tee-shirt tattooed on his body. The one that you made with the machine with russian language, with you, like looking off into space. I was like, whoa, fucking

Speaker 4:          03:00:41       insane swearing. It's insane. Especially like, I mean when I, when I saw that joe rogan means road yogan, I was just use the guy's a wizard. Whoever did that shit. I had gotten done a show in oxnard and my kids were in the other room. My wife is a new one out with you and you know, I just, it

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       stops talking shit that made me, that made me giggle so hard. I could not, the ini just gotten high and I was in a room by myself. My famIly is in another room and I, I was like, dude, I wish. I hope this guy knows how much joy he just gave me. Like whatever I was thinking about, you know, like my sat or whatever. I'm dying fucking laughing. I was like, dude, thank you man. Well, it's the amount of effort that it takes to listen to so much audio that you can have a conversation back and forth between a dude and his self. LIke, you know, how many videos that guy must have had to listen to and how much editing he had to do to do that too. I want a fanboy out, but I'm a huge fan and it cuts to you. I was pissing myself.

Speaker 2:          03:01:43       I literally hit paul. You know what? Like when you get excited and you're like, I think you had sent it to me. Maybe. Maybe it's somewhat set. Maybe tommy said it to me and I immediately was too late, but I wanted to text everyone and go, I want everyone to see this. And then when it cut, by the way, I'm already giggling some, you know, and then when it cuts to me as the main ge chimp, I fucking howling howling and I'm excited. Chimp, like, oh jesus, I'll rip your dick off. Yeah, no fucking. And then when he just did the new one, I got to go pick up my daughter, uh, when he just did the new one on me drinking 30 to 35. Yeah. This pr firms, that time warp it really is, is, it's a time warp. When the fuck do you ever sit down and talk to somebody for three hours?

Speaker 2:          03:02:26       So the best. It's the best thing about these podcasts is that you literally sit and catch up and break balls and giggle, come up with brilliant challenges due to its changed me. It's changed me as a person. My, my ability to communicate is so much. I'm just so much better at it than I was nine years ago when I first started doing this. You really are there. I mean, I, I, I can say this as a fan, I think anyone who listens, I've been listening to podcasts. I always listen to the podcast. You've changed immeasurably in almost the most renaissance way is like you have conversations with people. I wouldn't know what the fUck they even do, but there's still hints oF exaCtly who you are. You're very measured and what you say and how you put out your ideas. You listen, you're willing to change.

Speaker 2:          03:03:08       I remember when you stopped saying faggot, I remember when you were like, you know what, I think I'm going to stop saying that. Like in conversation. I remember I was like, oh, that's a good idea. Maybe I'll just stop to. We were in the old desk squad, uh, east or west. Was it? Oh, in pasadena. Yeah. Yeah. Well the problem is, it's a fun thing to say and you don't mean it in a homophobic way. It's stills fun to say I still let it slip out every now and then. Age, like a fine wine. It's a fun thing to say, but the problem is the way it makes other people feel. It's not fun. It's language should be about intent. It should be about you're conveying your intent through a sound. Yeah, but the problem is it's not working correctly. Like if, if someone is hearing it on the other end and it's making them angry and you're like, but no, I'm silly. I'm being silly about it. I'm gonna silly faggot. Like they're like,

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       no, no, no. You can't. Like, okay, well it's not. This is an ineffective use of sound to convey my thoughts. Yeah, and is it worth it to piss people off? You know, is it worth it? Like, look what happened with tommy and the word retard, which he's not calling anyone that it's not the, the bid is about forbidden language and he literally. All he said in that bit was that you're not allowed to use that word anyMore. and in saying that there was massive protests. There's all these people freaking out because they don't even want you to utter the sound. It's a real problem because that kind of thinking is nonsense. Like this to say that it can't be used ever, that you can't admit that it's a word, like you cannot say it, you cannot utter it, but it's abracadabra, that it's a magic word.

Speaker 1:          03:04:47       You can't even bring it up in conversation. Who had to understand that we are changing. So this word, whatever the word is, that you can't say it anymore because remember they were trying to get rid of bossy. Do you remember bossing? No. Yeah, yeah. They were trying to say that bossy is a sexist word. You shouldn't use bossy. They abandoned it, but it's that point is that they'll, they'll try to find something to be offended by and they'll try to put whatever that word is into this forbidden category and then you can have so many words in that category. Then it's going to be crazy and then you have noises that you can't make. I think the real thing that's going to change and I really think this is going to happen, is we're going to figure out a way to bypass language is going to be weighted to directly convey information to people without language and it's going to happen through some sort of technology and elon musk was talking about it on the podcast or something called neuro link that he's working on that some sort of a really revolutionary way to increase bandwidth between you and ideas and how ideas get to your head.

Speaker 1:          03:05:48       It's going to Be something that you were and I think that's going to be like step one and then you're going to be able to do that from person to person. And I think you know, all this were so invasive now with social media like it's so and cell phones and electronics. everything is in your life and people are getting closer and closer to each other. And one of the Side effects is that of that is that people now realize they can hurt you so they can attack you easier. And they go and they can tear things down to can light things on fire because they can, not necessarily because it's a wise thing or it's a measureD thing or it's a really well thought out thing. They're doing it just Because it's a new thing that they can use. Like you gave a chimp and ak 47 and they just started shooting up the jungle. I mean literally that is what a lot of people were doing with social media, but I think that is just a stage and that eventually we're going to bypass language. I really do. I really think that the thing it's going to be like emojis, that way they can communicate through like a form of hieroglyphics almost. This is a conversation that you need to have a November 5th one. I'm high. We're going to be bang big drunk. Fucked up November 5th. I can't fucking wait. let's wrap this up. So, uh, we

Speaker 11:         03:06:55       kind of have a parameter. We'll figure it out as we go along. Got it written. All right. Here. I'll take a picture and leave it here. All right. But I figured this is awesome. This is awesome. It's going to be awesome. The belts going to be shit because we're going to have that belt every year. I can't fucking wait to get up. Deluxe belt to fat leather brass. Beautiful. Alright, your special tonight at midnight. Midnight tonight. Uh, it's called a strange times. Fucking amazing. We live in. I sold the material to store. Thanks so brookside for you, man. I'm excited too. Nervous to. Bye everybody.
