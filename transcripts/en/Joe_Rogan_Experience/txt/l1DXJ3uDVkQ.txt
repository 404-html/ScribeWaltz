Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Yeah, it makes me sad. It makes me sad if you'd tell me that you hear people saying anything bad about Gabriel, like he's the, he's that guy like that. When I think about people, like there's a few comics that everybody loves, like Ron White's one of them. If you say something bad about ron wagon, posting them up. I can't talk to you. Even agents love runway. Like he's changed their lives. If you start talking shit about Ron White, I don't have anything to say to you. Like there's no way. There's no way. Unless he was really drunk. I could see right way until this tore it open. Anthony. He was like fucking 57 years old. He got in a fistfight at some, uh, some bar because some woman was taking a picture with him and the boyfriend didn't like it. So the boyfriend was drunk. She came over to Ron.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Ron punched him in the face. He now he has to have like a has to bring a cop with him everywhere he goes. He goes, he brings a copy of the truck. He told me he brings a compliment. He's Kinda hire cops, make sure he doesn't punch people or they don't punch him. He's the best God would a good dude. I got this call from comedy central to come down and showcase at the Irvine Improv and I had to be spotless clean for 10 minutes and I go down and I really worked at it and I just pulled away some stuff and then they called me and they said, you're not in it. I'm like, okay. They go, you will make the cut next year. So I called Gabriel, thank them. He goes, well, what are you talking about? You're not in it. Give me five minutes. And he calls back because you're doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       You're taping it. Okay. So the whole time I'm thinking, I'm doing this seven minute tv set that they have the taping. He pulled me over when he goes, listen, you call him crazy tonight. I go, but I've been working on this material. He goes, I don't give a fuck. He goes, I want you to go crazy. He goes, I'm going to pay for the show. He goes, I'm paying for it out of my pocket. If it makes the cut, it makes the cut or not. It's for me. I just wanted to me he paid for the episode that gets shot. That's the only got picked up for six. They shot seven because he wanted me to go off. Oh Wow. So at the end, the whole day, I'm thinking I'm going now. That's sad that get down. And he's like, no, no, no, you're doing fucking dirty shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       And he goes, I, I planned it this way. He goes, I don't give a fuck what they tell you. He goes, I want you to work this way for a reason. I brought it down here for a reason. He goes, worst case scenario, you make the DVD, you follow me. Like he was like, he fought for me to work dirty and they've got me on comedy central. Wow. It's just the feeling I always get from him. Just he's just seems like a real good guy. You know? I, I've never heard anybody say a bad word about Gabriel ever. Well, listen to this comics that know this and you know this, that the more you help out younger comics, the better it is for you. You learn, you look at younger guys and you learn little things. Sometimes I go to the comedy store, I see a younger comics say something on stage. Don't hire him because of that reason. Like I was saying, Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday? You want to the Ice House and whatever. Just because something they do, you know, but it's also good for you. You did

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       it for us, you helped us out. It made you a strong economic, you know, anybody knows that. Helping other guys along the way is great. Gabriel ride six deep. You think you needs to ride six deep six days before you go see Gabriel Lca, guys. Spanish songs and Mexican band. Because he'll put you up. Yeah, he doesn't care. That's beautiful. You got to make a living. Come on down. That's beautiful. There's not a whole lot of guys like that that. No, they'd be. They'd be suspect that you're funnier than them, but you're going to try this. No, no, no, no. Yeah, come on down and what do you want to eat? You know, can't worry about that or that, but you can't. The fund is in working with the best guys. The Fun, the fun is in, in and also seeing all these different stages. Like when you take a young guy on the road with you or when you see a young guy, I do a really good set of the store.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       You, you recognize like those moments were when you were young and you were just starting to figure your material out and you were just starting to figure out like how to really get to the heart of the matter quicker or what. What's actually funny about this, like what's clouding my judgment where I can't figure out how to get this funny, but occasionally these spark shine through and you have a killer bit and like in everybody knows like a young guy who in the early months we'll have like one bit when you see that bed and go, this motherfucker's funny. Like he's saying some shit. Like he might not have it right now with this motherfucker's funny. And when you see someone who's got that, it makes you like really aware of that whole process, you know, the whole process of just getting your legs under you as a comic and doing it and you know, and, and when you're around people who are also doing that, like it feeds off of it, like you could stay hungry like deepened to your, your career just by continuing to create material and continuing to be around other guys who are hungry.

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       And when you're doing that, like one of the things that's going on in our little group that is so, it's so dynamic is that everybody is hustling. Everybody is doing a podcast. Everybody's doing their standup. Everybody's recording specials, everybody's doing tours, everybody's doing shit. There's a lot going on. And it's all new stuff. You know, like Ari, he's got a new one. He's doing an Austin if you're in Austin, Texas next weekend, uh, he's doing his special at Cap City Comedy Club in Austin, which is one of the best clubs on the planet. And I don't think it's sold out. I think there's a little bit of tickets left, but probably gone soon, but his new shit, he's on fire. This is. This is the time to see him in ours. Never been better. He's never been better. He's crazy. He's crazy than the fucking. That was beautiful. That's why I love him because he's correct. I can't judge them. I just sit there, listen to the conversation. I always ask them, you walk around New York with other teacher though, you know it. I gotta go is. He genuinely doesn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I don't give a fuck if he. He became like the d don't give a fuck scale. He became like the new metric of not giving a fuck like they used to be accepted. There's levels of giving a fuck. You know, like you and I can't claim that we don't give a fuck the way he does because we have families are. You should fear is free. If should fear just got a vasectomy. He would give even less of a fuck. That would be like the last straw of fuck that he has left in his body. He's a barbarian. You know what show killed me will love it. You know what show like fuck with me when I did it. Tony Hinchcliffe show on Monday nights. The really good podcasts. He does it. The store, the one where he killed Tony Killed Tony. Oh, when you're watching the one minute people go.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       I went down at one night and I didn't. It wasn't about the material. It wasn't about anything but the look in their eyes. I remember that. Look in your eye pro when you don't have dinner in here. Yeah, and your car's got on me and your job sucks and he was swinging. I left there and I couldn't sleep that night because I went back to 94 when I used to go back to my room and cry or clubs. All of the performance. Some they'll be good. They'll be at the punchline. Would write that down there. I'm going to be there. Yeah. We get that San Francisco newspaper and at the end of the, just for laughs, the last three pages that had a comedy guide from Alaska all the way to Wyoming of all the comedy club listings, whether they will one night isn't that and I just sit there and circle them with a note booking through a line of coke and cries and some day I'll be at the fucking rusty, you know, but that's when I went to Tony Hinchcliffe show.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       There was, you know what it reminded me of. What was that movie? What rocky movie did he take them back to the ghetto and train them on three when they walked in, all the black dudes had veins in her eyes and shit like that. Like, yeah, whatever up. I didn't give a fuck. And he's like this memo. All these guys rock. This used to be you. Yes. This used to be. You look at their eyes. Rob was that. Was that rocky three? Was it Jamie? Jamie is on it already. All right, so two, he fights Apollo again and three he fights buster Lang clubber clubber Lang. I'm sorry, was he ain't got no heart, but you still have every night wishing you had a real man. Was a three. Bring your pretty little cell phone with my apartment tonight. I'll show you a real man and that was at a rock. He couldn't take it anymore. That was a great fucking movie, but one we call your kids to do. Dude. MrT. was one of the most terrifying fucking villains ever in a boxing movie, not Joe Rogan. Do you remember the doorman challenge? That dorm, how he became famous?

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       No. Okay. Him, Mr. t him and a bunch of other dudes on NBC. That was a show about either doorman what bounces and they did something and that's how he was noticed. Something weird. There was a show about the toughest bounces for awhile,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       six episodes, and he was the main one. Bounces doorman in 1980. It was like wild world of sports type thing. Hey, go back to that for a second. Jamie to that clubber Lang footage. The training footage. I was under the impression that like I remember thinking that he really looked good as a boxer, but I'm watching him shadow box there and I'm like, what? No one has a gift. The throwing like smoke at you. Everybody looks good while you're watching it. I love that scene. When Mickey was looking at the bubbles and he's getting mad, like, Ugh, ugh. If you like let it go, keep going. It'll a show him shadow boxing, which sometimes people don't look that good when they're shadowboxing because they're just trying to loosen their body up. There's a bunch of different like right there that does not look that guy who actually knows how to punch, but you know, it looks like a lot of swinging, you know, it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Those aren't punches, so like a lot of arm movements. We've got to meet in the head cut at that time, it's 1980. He didn't know what to expect. There's a thing with was shadowboxing, like some people think that shadowboxing should just be a loosening up thing. They just do it loose and they let the shoulders go loose and they try to work on their snap and they tried to move around, but then there's some people that think you should treat it almost as if it's a fight, like as if you're simulating a fight. Like Jamie looked this up, Joseph Vault Illini shadowboxing. He's a glory kickboxing champ and he put up this video of how he shadow boxes and you shadow boxes. Like he's in a fight. He doesn't think of it as time off or a warm up or something like that. What he does is he fights like a pretend opponent.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       It's pretty interesting because a lot of guys don't do it that way. Like not, not to this extent like uh, you know guys, when you're shadow boxing, a lot of it is just, he kinda loosened around you doing it on your own pace. You're working on your own shit, but what he does is kind of more like he treats it like a different kind of a workout like Justin Fortune does down at that gym to. Does he the second look at it as like a calorie burner in the beginning? Really just. I mean if you do it correctly, he says you should break a big sweater or something. Yeah, if you do it correctly. Which I don't know just. Well it's a lot of people think it's like visualization they think might be as important as anything else. Like everything's important. You know, it's important to be in shape.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       It's important to be strong. It's important to have experience in support and to have really good technique, but it's also important to visualize. There's something about carving pathways in the brain and obviously if you're a neuroscientist and you'll listen to this, you're like, oh my God, this idiot doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, but there's, there's something about carving pathways. This is not it. There's a, there's a different visual comedy. You have a dream shadowboxing. He's throwing kicks and punches and knees and backing up and you have a. This would stand up like you see yourself onstage killing. I've tried and I can't do it, like positive realization. No, I don't think it works with standup. I think um, no, I think uh, with stand up the thing, the kids doing it. I got it. I tried, I took the reef of fucked me up, but I couldn't come to focus.

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       Like the visualizations. Yeah. Like I couldn't see myself onstage like walking out and seeing people go. I could see myself coming out of the garden. I can't do that shit. Here's just for me personally, here's why I would try, I would try not to think like that because if I have, I visualize myself doing something and doing it really well. I would, um, I would think of, um, I wouldn't think of the thing I was doing anymore. Now I'm thinking of like the accolades or the position it is or look you're on a big stage and look, you know, you're at this place and you're at Massey Hall in Toronto or something, you know, some historic venue like, and then one day I was there like, that seems like you're thinking more about, about success than what, what success really is, is like if you're doing something and you try to do it, do it the best you can.

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       Not the or the reaction that it gets, so if I'm concentrating on the reaction, like I'm concentrating on going up there and killing, I would have to be visualizing doing a show, so I'd have to begin realizing people laughing. I can't. I've tried, I can't do it. I've sat there like at the gym and put right to cool off and he said, well maybe I'll see myself killing for the special or whatever. I didn't see any of that shit. Doesn't that make sense though? That if you think of yourself as killing you thinking of other people laughing, but you're not thinking about yourself then. Right? Like so if you're visualizing skiing, you're thinking about skiing, right? You're thinking about tucking. You're thinking about doing your moves in the correct way. You get the most amount of speed and the most amount of controls. You're headed down this hill, right?

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       You're not thinking about other people. You're not thinking about other people's response to each one of those things you do. Like if every time he did a curve and you didn't get a laugh, he'd be like, what the fuck? I thought it was skiing good. You know, if you tell a joke, well you get a laugh, right? But you don't want to think about that laugh. You don't want to visualize a laugh. You want to pretend that people are laughing at it. You want to actually find out what's funny and have other people tell you for you, like you kind of know, but you don't really know until you do it in front of them. Right. So to visualize that is really weird because you're visualizing two different mindsets so you're not in this the zone of actually being there. You're, you're visualizing artificial laughter. I mean, I guess you could visualize this state that you're feeling when you're killing, when you're really relaxed on stage and you're having a good time and everything's fun. I could visualize that state. That makes sense. I can't, but I think even that state, you could only like visualize it and I shouldn't say only.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Maybe I could only do it in chunks. I think I just think it's better to just concentrate on just doing. It just never worked for me. So I wonder if you ever did up. I on it. I just, I also think would stand up like you could do a lot of sets and stuff, but I don't know if he should concentrate on it as much as concentrating on just life itself and finding things that you think are funny and interesting. You know, because sometimes if you concentrate just on standup too much, you almost like narrows your focus. So you're thinking so much about standup. You're not thinking about shit to talk about onstage because you're not really thinking about it. You're, you're, you're obsessed with some tour date details or some, you know, some thing that might be an offer that's on the table. What do you think I should do it? Instead of thinking about that kind of Shit,

Speaker 3:          00:15:49       you just like, you only have a certain amount of resources that your brain has available and it's when you can stop thinking about like if you can just push any career ideas completely out of your head and just exist as a person and then go and do stuff. If you could figure out how to shut that off and go and do stuff, for me at least it gives me more ideas. I get more ideas that way and I get A. I'm. I feed my curiosity too quick. It feels like a feed. My curiosity and an honest way. Instead of thinking about religious reading, things that I would think would be funny on stage or read and stuff that I think would be fun to talk about in a podcast. I just look at Shit. That's interesting. You know?

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       Goddamn. It makes sense on a one to 10 right now we're cooking. It's up there like I've stolen this morning. I stopped at the weed store on the way up in a little half. I had a bull to get the party started my system. You know what I'm saying? We're about a month away from legal weed. That's it, but it's going to go down for people like me because the edible count is going down to 10 milligrams. I already got the warning of that. There will be meetings. That guy goes for you to 900 milligrams. Again, you'll have to be floated. You'll be fucking stuffed with gelatin. That 10 milligrams. Just stop this. Yeah, no, there's some shit going around that. I'm also doing that cbd to one to one. That's good too. Oh, not bad at night. This goddamn Jambo breath spray this. This one milligram does madison from God a. This one's a thousand of what? A spray bottle. The whole bottles of thousand. So if you're to take the top off that shit. That's really good. That's a bit open to that. I take the cbd off from a company in Denver. XNL. It's a 300 milligram c deal. When he got back

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       from Jujitsu, he put it right onto here. It doesn't get you out. This is the woman that just by the time you get out of the shower, you're like, what happened? Oh, who has seen? So it's just cbd oil because they, you know, they make it with marijuana dermally. Well that goes back. That goes into your system lot better. The one that one that I'm taking this for children. People don't want thc in it, but this one has such a high conscious trade of CBD oil. Yeah, but the other thing, they make it with something else. Oh, that he goes, put that on the tunnel. One or two drops. You're a big guy, right? When you get home from Jujitsu and then take a shower. Not too bad. Joe Rogan. Let's try this stuff here. Stuff of it. Some of it tastes like Dick. Some of it tastes like fucking guava juice. Does. These people that do require the Jews? Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       My bad mentor, my mentee is actually a nice little breast spray. Another two shots. The GL fucked up and did too many sprays. One of these ones before Sam Harris' podcast and Sam was talking crazy shit about artificial intelligence and all this other, you know, every time I talked to that guy, he's a neuroscientist. Very, very so I know. Yeah. I know. You know is right and I was. I was barbecued when I was talking to him. Like barbecued. I totally overestimated or underestimated. These sprays had no idea like I thought like a couple pumps is probably like a pot lollipop, you know? Now, I don't know. It must have been hundreds of milligrams each day. Anything under your fucking tongue like that? Yeah. It goes quick. Sixty seconds. You're on a plane. Next scene. The planes fucking making weird noises. That lighting on fire and now it was. Androids are hitting them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       It's going to change the world when it becomes legal folks and it's not going to change the world for the worst. It's going to change it for the better. It's gonna. Make people paranoid as fuck. It's going to make people nicer. Really. Is that paranoid as fuck thing? That's good. You don't say Dick Do. That's how I live. I don't say Dick. I don't know. No blame. There's some days I don't even fucking shave. I leave the house and they don't know. It's tremendous to live that way. I don't bother nobody. I go into starbucks. I don't hear nothing. I don't know. Nothing. Time for reflection. Yeah, that's it. That's all it is. Yeah. Yeah. One thing, I don't get hives when I go to the Jigsaw, I still can't work that up yet. That's too real phone call Joey. That's too real for me. Somebody gets me the deep south. I'm fucking history. Used to get high before I fuck you guys do the eye candy and I used to take giant bong hits, giant bomb and then we would roll. Yeah, I'd have a panic attack. Yeah. We would go into class and as soon as somebody gets on top of you like that and he would teach like that, he would teach like that. Blitzkrieg teach like a, like a Jedi Knight. Yeah. He teach tremendous master how you want your fucking dude unconscious. Well, for him, for his style

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       of the key. He's like, um, you know, Eddie, he's got a very interesting style, not just of Jujitsu but of explaining his Jujitsu, you know, explaining all the moves and all the different positions and it's like a, there's a, there's like a presentation that he's doing. It's like a, it's like an art form. We pay. Somebody brought me a comedian friends. He's doing something completely different. On the other side, because every place you show up to do comedy is one fucking do it with a 10 plan is at least he's got a little any of these three for people because even the little towns, they get the videos and get a mat and they do all that shit by themselves watching a fucking videos. They've told me when I went to Omaha, people came in from our ma. There's a 10th planet Endo Model. That's great, but people who don't want to make.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       The people were telling me they get like couches, Jujitsu couches, mattress. That's like they're fucking grassy. So if your little town doesn't have an eddie spreading and now like his students are winning fucking tournament and now Ebi is on Tbi is game the best thing to ever happen to submission grappling because it made it exciting. They figured out a way to about rules and you know that right? But when I'm reading Hugh Jitsu magazine and this saying that they're gonna take, they're gonna start using Ebi rules and shit. Ebi Is Eddie Bravo exhibit. Yeah. You know, Chael Sonnen did it and here's how beautiful Eddie is. Eddie doesn't even want money for them using it. I'm pretty sure he was like, yeah, I just want those rules to be established as the best rules. Just give me credit called the Ebi rules and you can use some smart way to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       He just wants to spread Jujitsu in the right way and you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with having a non tbi rules of any either. You know, like if somebody wants to do like what metamorris was doing and have these long bouts and if they go to draw at the end to go to draw at the end, you know, a lot on the podcast, some of the time you got to break everything down and be like just I bbs and well there's anybody. So essentially anybody can essentially start their own rules like Abu Dhabi where uh, Eddie choked out heuler they had a very interesting rules where the first period of the fight there was no points and then encouraged you to go for it. Right? So you try to submit someone within the first, uh, first half of the fight or take it real conservative, which was another approach, and you play super defense for the first half of the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       Then at the second half of the fight you can score points. So you score points for take downs, score points for guard, passes, near submissions, things like that. So I think their, their logic was that if they just have no points in the beginning, it doesn't matter if a dude mounts you, doesn't matter if a guy takes your back, if you defend, if you're trying to attack him and go after him, sometimes you'd worried if I don't get this guy might be so far behind it points I'll never catch up. Like if you just go for it and you fuck up and you wind up in a bad position, then you defend that position and then you get back to your feet and then maybe the guy takes you down. That's a sequence of events that if you're counting takedowns and near submissions and things like that can put you in his giant deficit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:54       And if the guys that good that he could do that to you, maybe you underestimated them and you'll never catch up to them, but you could find out if you just go for it, if you both go for it and you don't worry about points. So that was their idea I think. I think to promote more excitement so people just go for it in the beginning. And then the idea about the second half is that once you're establishing who's the better grappler, when two guys roll and they're trying to kill each other, you learn pretty quick who's better. And so then if no one's better, if it's just by a very, very, very slight edge. So if you've gotten to the second half of the fight and you both, you're both in a neutral position but you both attacked, both defended and no one's had any sort of an upper hand.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       Those last few minutes is, it's really going to count because that's the few minutes where your determination in training camp showed up. Your ability to adjust, your ability to overcome. Like all those things really do determine who's best. So having that towards the end of the fight. That makes sense. How long has Abu Dhabi, if I go to the whole man, that's a good question because at 2:15 says the two times I'm a don't remember, I'm thinking it's two tens, but that seems like a long time. Maybe it was less than that. Um, Abo dobby submission, grappling time limits. Because what does Eddie doing with Ebi? He does the first. How many minutes? I'm not sure. I think it's like the first nine minutes or something like that. They just go at it and there's no points. And if some, if they make it into the final or they make it a pass at time limit, then they go through these series of bad positions.

Speaker 2:          00:25:31       Like one guy starts on the other guy's back and he has over under and then go, ready, go. And you start from there. So one guy has got your back and you have to defend it. And if you can tap him then he has an opportunity to try the same position. And if you could tap you, I think it goes to who? God who. First I think it like it's in the amount of time it took to tap them, so that's where the competition would be five minutes over time. So qualifying rounds, six minutes, three minutes overtime if there's a draw finals, eight minutes, four minutes over time if there's a draw with no advantage. So what it probably is like four minutes in. They start scoring the point. Yeah, there it is right there at the first four minutes are without positive points, but negative points start from the beginning of the fight until the end.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       And I think negative points or like when you draw guard, when you pull guard, I think that was a negative point. I don't know if it still is, but I think that's silly because some guys, if they pull you into their guard, you're fucked. Like there's guys like vinny malaise lace or like, um, a Shinya Aoki. That guy is just nasty fucking guard. If in his guard you're in a terrible place, the church is sponsoring vinny magalogs a magalog is a bad mother. I love his Jujitsu. So fucking high level man. You know, he's, he spent a lot of time fighting in MMA and because of the fighting in the mma, I think a lot of people slept on his Jujitsu. They forget what a fiend ami is. He Flying Armbar, paid the Pano, who's like this multiple time Brazilian jujitsu world champion and vinny. Vinny Magalhaes hit him with a flying arm bar.

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       Do you know that's, that is like pulling your deck out and slapping it across a world champions face. I mean literally how, how powerful that move. But when you say flying, check this out, see if you could find it. He's huge. Two, usually 230 pounds and he hits him with a flying arm bar and it's perfect. She was perfect. Like there's no, there's no defending. Now this guy that he's. This is uh, this is Chris Weidman. He got Chris Weidman with it too. Yeah. Well you could watch this to. I mean Vinnie did hit Chris Weidman with the same shit. Dude. Vinnie's super worldclass. Now you gotta remember Chris Weidman a two time NCAA all American wrestler like super fucking grappler.

Speaker 2:          00:27:58       And that's how good Vinnie Meg Alexis. I mean, Weidman, when he won the UFC, let's see if you could find it in here because this is a long match. Weidman, when he, uh, when he won the UFC middleweight title from Anderson Silva was widely thought to be like one of the toughest best wrestlers, best grapplers it's ever fought in the middleweight division. There was a big strength of his, is that he was just so nasty on the ground and so fucking strong. Oh my God. Exactly. You see when a dude can do that to a Chris Weidman, that's what a bad motherfucker. Vinny Magalhaes says, you just don't. That doesn't happen. Watch this again. Come on, son. I mean he just took that with just spectacular technique and he's a huge guy. I, he will say he's at least, you know what to 10 or something like that to 15, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       In the UFC he fought a light heavyweight. Right? Go find. Yeah, because you've lost a Ryan Bader and the finals member of the ultimate fighter. She's striking. You know, he got better at striking, but that was what had held him back. His Jujitsu is off the fucking chain. He did another stint in the UFC. Right. Me Do a couple stents. Yeah, but like you get caught in that guy's guard, you're fucked. Like that's a bad position. So I disagree with them. Like saying that pulling guard is a one point disadvantage. So if he pulls a gun out on me, really mega lez urine health, urine, hell no, like get out of it. But you're in danger. You're in severe danger. There's people where their guard is more of a defensive position as people with who the wrap their legs around you and what they're trying to do is just kind of hold on me to just breathe.

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       Yeah. Maybe they're taking their sweet time. They're get to breathe, they're gonna relax and then they're gonna. Maybe try to explode back up to their feet or try to reverse your. Try to stand up or something like that. But then there's guys like vinny, they're trying to break your arm and that's immediately what it's going to go to. It was going to go to rubber guard. I mean, Vinnie has like really fucking ridiculous experience when it comes to submissions. I mean he's just super technical and a big guy like that's a rare combination. If you get caught in that guy's guard, you're, you know, you're not favored to get out of it. Especially if you underestimated it. Like that's another thing about guards, if you train with a guy, it was like an Eddie Bravo or his guards just all ultra dangerous. If you don't train with a guy like that, maybe the guys in your gym, they're not scary from their back so you don't worry about it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:38       Maybe you're a wrestler, maybe you got good defense, you feel like, you know what, I see that shit come and nobody gets me in my gym, but they probably don't have the same level of guard. There's some guys out there that have this ridiculously reflect refined level of God. You remember Paul Sas? No. So the guy in the UFC, he won almost every fight. I think he won one by. He'll hook. He, he, he, he'll hooked. Michael Johnson who is going to be fighting. Habib never gotten that off. But Paul Sas Triangle the fuck out of everybody. I mean he triangled the fuck out of everybody. Nobody can get away from his triangle. It was just this crazy thing. If this kid would grab a ahold, we'd pull guard. He would get his creep, his legs up over your shoulder. And before you know it, you were choking herself to sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       She was incredible. He, I don't remember how many fights he won by triangle, but it was so ridiculous because everybody knew it and he would go out there and he would do it and everybody's like, just stay the fuck away from his triangle. Just stay the fuck away from his triangle. Next thing you know, he's on his back and you're like, it's a terrible position to be in. And if a guy's legs are like really good at doing those movements, your legs are so strong. There's so much stronger than your arms. The thing that we lack is not strength. It's dexterity. Well, some guys figured that dexterity thing out and when you have these high level guys, you'll see if you. That's just a. That was one where he won by leg lock here. But look how good he is dude. Like when he, when he gets guys into a position where they think that they're safe, it's all it is, is another leg lock to look at that.

Speaker 2:          00:32:13       Oh this is nasty shit man. But, so this is my point is that like there are guys that are super, super dangerous off their back. It shouldn't be a negative point. Michael. Jonathan has nothing on. Has not thrown a punch. So even if you mess with him. Yeah, he got tore up here. I mean this is a bad because if they get rid of Paul says they get videos, economy think. So I don't remember. I mean he didn't win all of his fights. He was a tough, tough guy. But man, his submissions were awesome to watch and he fucked a lot of guys up off his back another. And this is an mma whereas actually, oh damn, that's nasty. And they tapped right there. And this is an mma where you can get punched in Abu Dhabi, you can't even get punched so you can get much deeper in a position to not worrying about worrying about being vulnerable to strikes.

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       So guys like Gary Tonin was like one of the best in the world right now. He's, I'm known for his leg locks and he takes off his back all the time. So to think that that guy gets a negative point because he's attacking off of his back to me. So that's loony as loony. If he gets a hold of you and you're in his guard, you're going to get your knee ripped apart. If guys at a knee ripper, I mean they're all the Donna, her death squad, that's what they call themselves. You know John Donahoe Dude, he's got like a hundred knee rippers over there. Just get super technical leg lock guys were there and they're all doing it primarily off their back. But in MMA it's way more dangerous in MMA. Guys can punch you.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       Oh wait, no. That Fried Shit I've told you once I told you you given makes me nervous. It gives me anxiety. Are you one of those guys that shows up for Jujitsu class for wrestling shoes on? No, there's always a guy like that. No. There is a guy at my place and you don't want to fuck with them or say something about his restaurant. He don't speak the language. He's like from Bulgaria. Oh yeah, yeah. One minute. You're in this garden, next one that you're swinging around the. Yeah, and the Sambo Guy. I'm 100 to 100 pounds heavier dude. Those guys are terrifying. Like the first day he came in to visit and all you heard was Ba, ba Ba boom. Yeah. He didn't really know. Like he just. Just a great guy. Yeah. He thought he was still in the fucking Kamala over there. Well, he was probably great guys.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       Great guys. Just buddies. A Blue Bell always take the time to teach me something. Great guys. I mean it, but he just has the strength of dead fucking skinny guys from Russia, whatever those little, those little neighborhoods can be. Those motherfuckers been, you know, they don't pick up weights. They pick up trees and shit like that. And they know how to handle off balance and stuff. It's a really beautiful thing to see. I want to. I stayed one day afterwards as I was getting dressed and he was teaching like the higher balance, like they were flying. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Sambo guys especially, uh, there's, you know, there's two types of. There's combat sambo, which is like would fade or used to fight in. You ever see that where they put headgear on and they have like a judo, Jackson mma gloves and they beat the fuck out of each other. Dude, that's a, that's one kind of sambal that's more of a, you know, it's, it's kind of a hybrid. It's almost like they have the juno jacket. They were fucking judo jack and shorts on the, um, the guy has the world series of fighting heavyweight champion. I forget his name, but he's a Russian gentleman and he's a guy who is that his name? It got. But he's, he's the first guy to beat fader in a long time. He beat him in combat. Sambo before fate or a wind up losing an MMA. Yeah. I vanoff blog, a blog boy Ivan off blog, avant off is it tough, tough fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          00:35:57       But he beat fade or in that combat sambo stuff where they had the judo jacket on shit, and I think it was before fate or was went on that losing streak. Now combat is. Well, obviously you show up with fucking swords and shit. No, no, they just, they just, it's just mma. It's MMA with a judo jacket on. Now. What color? Peach. That's a good question. What does Chris Herzog is big time sambo? This guy comes over and does seminars in rockchester. I would have to bad or the other. I don't know. I don't. I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of. I mean I'm not, I'm not that well versed in, in Zombot, but there's two different styles. Assembling. A lot of times people confuse the two of them. Like, um, one time I was watching a fight and they were talking about this guy's a sambo background and the commentator was saying that he didn't think that in sambo there were strikes, so probably won't be as comfortable with getting hit because he's a sambo guy, but he, but he didn't realize is he actually came from that combat sambo background, which is the fate or background, which is where they would have these fights.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       Were you ever seen it see, pull up combat sambo because it's kind of wild. It's weird looking like it's high level MMA, but they have judo jackets on and headgear and they're kicking the shit out of each other, punching the shit out of each other. I mean, it is mma, but there's also grappling to. And they're aided by the, the, the thing. Yeah. I mean this is a, is weird looking, right? They got a fucking jacket on and they're doing mma. I, it doesn't totally make sense.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       No cage, you know, look at that. Oh shit son. Oh my God. That was a three 62. Yeah. So you know, that's. Yeah, no cage. I like a lot. I've been saying this lately, I think this is stupid. I think cages are stupid. I think if we have a floor that's big enough to have a basketball game, you have a floor that's big enough for two days to fight. Fuck, come on. You put down some mats. No more walls. This pushing each other up against the wall is stupid. Unless you're fighting some hallway. Why are you fighting all go outside out in the woods. You crazy kids. They did in Russia, man. They had a fucking a MMA fight on a football field. But what the fuck were you talking about and the way in today, you would drop some knowledge on me about some gym where they're fighting in the fucking movie with the black dudes.

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       What's that movie that the kid came on? He. Billy Corbin did. Oh, dogfight. Yeah. Then when we told them about dog fighting, and you're talking about some gentleman, you said you'd save it for the podcast. This is what I was telling you. Like, do you know what happened with conor Mcgregor and Nate Diaz with a bottle? They threw water bottles, plastic water bottles. Uh, they got, someone might've thrown a monster energy, can someone throw a can see if it can hit you or someone you care about that would suck the water bottles, like come on. Anyway, they got fined a $150,000 and it should definitely shouldn't fucking throw water bottles. Right. So part of me is like, well if they get discouraged throwing water bottles, that shit stupid. Right? But, but did the altercation, the altercations probably good for business. The altercation. I mean I get excited.

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       I see Nate Diaz and conor mcgregor screaming at each other cry and it'll fuck you. No fuck you. Fuck. You can get crazy with each other. It makes you excited. And I think that generates a pay per view buys. I don't think conor stupid. I don't think nate stupid. I think they're smart. I think they know what they're doing when it comes to that kind of stuff. So that's a part of the show. I mean, did he really think he was gonna hit him with that water bottle? You know, fucking Nate Diaz. It's hard to hit him with a punch. How the fuck are you going to hit him with a water bottle that's coming from 300 feet away? He's not going to see that. He's not going to move out of the way of that water bottle, you know? I mean what they decide to get upset about and what they don't decide to get upset about is what's weird about athletic commissions.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       You know, like one of the things they were talking about whether or not they were going to test nate for his vape pen because he had a cbd vape pen, which is cbd, not even, not even psychoactive. It doesn't make you high, but it does alleviate some inflammation and it provides people that have like back pain or something like that or especially after a long fight provides you with a little relief. But what's crazy is the only reason why they would want you to not do it. Obviously it's not performance enhancing. You're not performing anymore. The performance is over. So are they protecting you from yourself? Like what are they doing? They, they, they, they don't want you to do it because you're flaunting the fact that you're doing it in front of everybody. They piss him after the CBD. We'll just through smoking that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       I think he had already done his post fight thing. I think you'd do that before you do the press conference. I think. I don't know though. It's a good question. I'm not entirely sure and they might do it different way differently in different places, but either way you're not concerned about him. Like what do you, what's the issue? Like what is the issue? It's just, it looks bad. Does it look bad that he's that vapors coming out? He's scared of dragons. Let's see. Bdo business went the roof then. I'm sure it did and it should and it should room and wait, wait until it becomes illegal. We're a month away. When it becomes legal then it's really going to go nuts. It's going to be good for everybody, but anyway, so they get fucking pissed at him for that. But the, the connor the fine was so high. I'm like a hundred and $50,000. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:41:39       Well, you said he made $40 million. Next time shut your mouth. They won't fucking know. That's true. 100. You know, even the other kid made to three mil, half of that after taxes. One point five on 50. Don't really put a dent in your fucking thing. Next time you won't throw fucking bottles. That is. You've got less state bowling unless they both went to Dana. So listen, this jacked up the things we like to see it. We want them to use. Pick up the tab for them. $300 because it came out of your fucking and for the paper views something. There's always 1:50 is not that bad. They walked away with a ton of loot. It's a good point. It's got to be some type of repercussion. One 50 and they can fight again in November. Right? Listen, I got to court without a license. 10, 15 years ago in la. First time ever I was talking on the phone like I pulled over. He goes, where's your license? It didn't work that day I went down to La County. I stepped in front of a judge by BIPAP. The guy looked at me straight in the face. She goes, you could pay 200 and come back with your license will give me 50 and I don't want to see you again.

Speaker 2:          00:42:39       What do you think I did? I gave him $200. Game Five, 5:50 and in time I got my license. Not with a gun to my head. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       Sometimes you pay a little extra that let you fight in November. Now you earn next time and now you could make up that 1:50. You're earning at least they're not suspended for a year.

Speaker 2:          00:42:57       Yeah, that's true. Here's, here's my thought, but I don't think 150 is bad. If you've got a good charity for it. The center of the charity. Yeah. Instead of going to an athletic department, what? I mean, I'm sure the athletic department department somewhere that'd be a girl's soccer team or something like that for that day. I know that that's like a good thing, right, but 300,000 into their pocket is what pisses you off. What they decide to get mad at. And what they don't decide to get mad at, because this is the thing that I found. Do you know, did you watch when Floyd Day, whether it was doing, I believe it was for showtime, they were doing one of those behind the scenes things at his gym and he has what he calls doghouse fights and I just let me just say that this kind of thing has been going on in Jim's forever, right?

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       They've always had gym wars and people have even set up and this was a thing that I'm pretty sure it became illegal in California fairly recently. Within the last decade. They stopped allowing people to have what they call smokers and what a smoker is. They have organized fights, but there's not really like a lot of medical on hand only gets paid. Nobody gets paid paid. But it gives people valuable experience. So used to have a lot of them in Muay Thai. Like I used to go to them. They were cool. They would set up these little plastic lawn chairs. You'd pay a small amount of money, you know, like 30 bucks or something like that. And you go and you watch all these amateur fights and a lot of times kids are pretty fucking talented and it's fun to watch. But so always had organized jim fights. So essentially what floyd mayweather did was have his own, like in house Jim fights like amateur fights. Like they didn't even disguise the fact that it was a competition. Like they weren't trying to, uh, they weren't trying to spar. Like these guys are having fights and he's, he was talking about how it's to the death. It's really crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       And he has these guys. One guy gets beat up and he's hocked seem rock bonds brother or son Seen Rockmont son I believe. See if you could see if you can google who the gentleman was. Comments are saying it was his brother, but his brother, maybe it's his brother. That makes more sense because how seem Rockmont is not that old to have a kid that's, that, you know, like, that developed because he looks like he's like in his twenties maybe is. Anyway, point being so this English guy beats up, seen brock bonds, one brother, and then the mom comes back with the bigger brother and the English guy fights him to all on the same day and they're fighting like these 30 minute rounds just gets crazy

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       because during a winter and they put it on TV. Yeah, I mean dude, if there's definitely. And sorry, the question was, is that Jesus? No, I don't think there is. I mean there might be, I mean floyd might reward them or something like that, but I mean it's, it's crazy shit and I mean in one way, yeah, this will develop, develop character and I don't have a problem with people doing whatever they decide to do. If somebody wants to fight a 30 minute fight, I don't have a problem with that. You should be able to do it if you want to. They've been doing this. Jesus love Chicago, but the thing is some Boston when he was a brown belt Galley with your buddy issue that this. But um, but the thing is I'm not a promoter in Las Vegas, right? That's a big difference. That's a big difference and I'm not a professional fighter on television.

Speaker 2:          00:46:38       I'm not, I'm, you know, I'm, and I'm not necessarily saying there's anything wrong with what he did because it is a part of gym culture. It is a part of what's made champions. I mean this kind of stuff, these, this heat, these heated battles. This is a very uncomfortable reality that elite fighters like floyd mayweather face like to be that good, you have to be that real. And for a guy like him to show like these kind of crazy 30 minute, no time limit fights in the gym and put it on tv, it's pretty wild. It's in and I see both sides of it. I totally see floyd made with a side of it. Look at him. He feeds off that, but guess what? That mentality is why that motherfucker was $49. Zero, right? That mother, arguably the best boxer ever, who, who got hurt less than floyd mayweather,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       who box people's face off that everybody thought it was going to kill him better than floyd mayweather. When he fought my Donna and he found him the first time and my daughter caught him in one of the exchanges, like right before the bell rang and we were like, whoa. And then they fought again the second time and he just put a clinic on my Donna just put a clinic on him. It was like, all of a sudden my donald was fighting a totally different guy, like floyd had figured out my style or decided not to fuck around this fight and decided to really take him seriously and really focus on him. And he just beat his ass brother. Different things. A lot of ways I agree with a lot of this shitty does, you know? But uh, listening to him, his emotion games off the charts, off the charts, he's self promotion games the greatest of all time.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       He's making me more money. He's made me laugh at night sometimes. I've watched this show and he's made me laugh and it said, show you watch because you don't really like the dude. I mean, he, you know, so I know that I would love him. I bet I love it. I would love him. He's a psycho and I wanted to fight like three times. I'm like, you know what? The proof is in the motherfucking putting. Exactly. That's it. Exactly is in the pudding. Let them do whatever the fuck he wants. You don't. You don't get a guy like that unless he's a guy like that. You don't get that $49 unless he's that kind of dude, but I think he handles it as good as any fucking human being that could be in that position. Handles it. It's a crazy position to be in, to be a young guy and be worth that much money.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       And you're known your nicknames. Money. Mayweather. I mean what the fuck? Names himself. Money. He's hilarious. I ain't got nothing wrong with you. If you talk shit and back at any point. Well, if you know what I'm reading right now, a buddy of mine gave it to me. Hollywood hadn't listened to you old enough for that. Hollywood had this. There was a dallas cowboy. That was the real deal. You understand me? They don't even make them like that. No more showed up rookie day. I'll give you the article with three hits of acid, a gram of blow right here, the thousand dollars in the off season. He would rent the hotel and hanging out with prior at the comedy store while he would have the one was the lab would point the sisters. This was before Rick James and before they played the Denver Broncos in this claim to fame, he went on national TV and took care of the orange crush with the Denver Broncos, drink that soda and he fucking crushed it with the juice in one hand and the super bowl. He intercepted in score. There's online, back and they just fucking blow up the ball with big fucking, you know, he talks shit. People, hey, hey. He talks shit on Game Day. He showed up and they threw him out because he put fucking two fingers up during the game and the owner of the cowboys. So um, at that time, what's two fingers, you can do two things. They will lose on TV, national TV and Hollywood Henderson. The camera came over. Instead of watching, he advertised the towel goes, Yo, if you need these tiles.

Speaker 1:          00:50:26       And then we'll like to receive his company

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       the next day. Tom Landry Fine Hollywood Henderson. And after that it was all over. He was smoking crack and Bazookas. But he won the lottery in Texas. He was a liar. He became a born again Christian. Oh my goodness. Oh motherfucker dog. Wow. That's a fun story.

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       Yeah man. I just want to be clear about all that stuff that I was saying about the floyd mayweather thing. I just think that the athletic commissions, you know, like when they find people and when they get mad at people for stuff, it's sometimes they do it in a very heavy handed way. And I think it's kind of obscene. Like what happened with vandelay Silva I think is obscene. You know that story, they banned vandelay for life. He, he ran away from a test, which he definitely shouldn't have done, definitely shouldn't have done. But if he was on something, they shouldn't have been on. Suspend him as if you caught them for that. Something like suspend him for, you know, maybe an extra six months because he's a dick because he ran away from you. But you can't save for life. He can't just take away.

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       It was, it wasn't that isolated incident only vandelay. Who was it the old way? Isolated incident. Yeah. Vandelay wasn't as positive before. No. Vandelay has never tested positive for ever know that. I mean it's not saying he hasn't done anything like in, in pride, you know, ensign. Anyway, when he's on here, he was talking about his pride contract and he said it was and Eve Edwards at the same thing. It said in capital letters we do not test first steroids. They give you a syringe on the house and Shit. Yeah. So I mean it's not saying that he didn't do them ever, but he never. Vandelay never tested positive. No. So they had no reason to suspect him other than, you know, if you follow the sniff test, you know, but you got no. There was no proof. I mean, and again that's the only argument, whether it's proof or not per se, it's not whether or not you think he was guilty. I would say something. I thought I had a like good stories about hiding from probation officers and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:52:47       This is. Oh, this is. This is actual instance contract at the bottom there. Oh, here it says performance enhancing stimulants of steroid based family are specifically excluded from the scope of the test. Why don't they just right have at it boys and gals to and so I hit everybody's one probation over some bolder that used to fuck with me so I had to hide from him from time to time, but I've heard some stories. He is after about some of the Brazilian fighters in Shit. What they've done with us goes down there, whatever the fuck it is, didn't Jose? I will stop them at the airport. Something happened where they got their fucking visas return. The something like that. The Brazilians have a Tory is for fucking with these people. Fucking with them. Something that happened, they were at the airport has got the gun.

Speaker 2:          00:53:37       That was somebody else who had a problem. Well the guy came to all those gym and they didn't know who the guy was and they didn't trust them. And you got to also, I mean all suspicions decided that people always have, when someone comes to you and says they're going to test you for steroids and then you don't want to take that test, there's always gonna be suspicion, but that's because you're guilty, but you have to take into consideration the possibility that it was not communicated very well, that you might be talking about two different languages and although who speaks a little bit of English but not that much, all of a sudden these meeting these people and he's in Brazil and he's very famous so he doesn't know if he's being fucked with. He didn't know this is real. If it's random, if they just show up, nobody warns you.

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       So it's not like the UFC calls you up and says, Joseph, how are you man? It's Mike from the UFC. I just want to let you know that this guy who was testing you right now for steroids is totally legit. No, they just show up, dude. They just show up and they don't even want to present you with information. They don't want to present you with id like Chael Sonnen was telling a story about how when they tested him and how bizarre it was. Then they say they pulled them into a bathroom or something like that to test him. Yeah, like a, like a, a janitor's closet or something. They tested them in a janitor's closet and he's like, what the fuck? You're drawing my blood. And he's like, it turned out to actually be Usada. He goes, but it could easily have been just some fucking crazy person who just wanted my blood and my piss, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:55:00       I mean, you don't know. It's not what happened with Tim Kennedy. What happened with him? That they went over to his house and he came home from the gym. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And the guy made him take a shower. I don't know how to read the whole thing. They couldn't do the test for like an hour for some reason. I don't know. I don't remember what the reason was. Or maybe the guy had to get the test brought over or something and the guy goes, I have to keep an eye on it. He goes, really well, listen. He goes, I might take a shower. I just got done training and that's actually if you. Especially if you're doing Jujitsu, it's actually really important that you jump in the shower because you get scratches and those scratches on your body. You can get staff on those and staff lives in your nose and it lives in saliva and it lives in like when you're. You're doing Jujitsu, you're awash in bacteria. A hold weapon. Gunpoint is this guy showed up in his driveway. When is. This is an August. Oh my God. Demands to know who he is. A little story on it. Holy Shit. These motherfuckers are coming over like the cubes to your house. If you ever drive down Tim Kennedy's block mixture. He knows who the hell you are.

Speaker 2:          00:56:14       They come on you. You can't do that shit y'all. You can't pull up slowly pulling up to Kennedy's driveway and parking his car. The side of the collector was at the

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       wrong end of a barrel. Whoa. He demanded know who he was. It looks like Kennedy is cleaning up the streets as you saw to tries to clean and professional mixed martial arts. Wow. Wow. That is crazy. Saying that he thought that Usada Rep might be a terrorist disguised as a urine collector. Wow. That's funny. Yeah. That's a dangerous guy to sneak up on you. GotTa. Be Real careful.

Speaker 3:          00:56:54       That's not a guy you want to fucking. He's gotta be a little Diaz. Didn't let him in stone sleep and a lot of people don't like the idea of just being stopped. Like you have to always worry about that. That's an added element that you think of that you have to be stopped in the middle of your sleep. Someone can wake you up at 7:30 in the morning thing done and you have to give them blood and piss right there. It has to deal. So you've lost lot and I think so. I think. I think at the very least are tasting. They're testing blood. I know Nevada was doing urine to. Well, if they're still doing urine, but the more stringent tests apparently are all blood based,

Speaker 3:          00:57:44       it's um, you know, you have to give them a schedule where you're going with time. You're training. Cowboy got in trouble. That's tough. That's tough. Probably got in trouble because they said we're at your ranch. He goes, well, I'm at the UFC and he's like, you have to let us know where you going. It goes, well, doesn't the UFC tell you I'm going to be here? He's like, this is where I'm going. Like I'm promoting the UFC. I'm here for the UFC. I got a fight coming up. That's why I'm there. Like they didn't tell you I was going to be there and so they have to warn him and give him like, you're a bad boy because we didn't know where you were. We'll send someone here, mother Fucker, you know where he is now. I'm here, right? Yeah. But he apparently he had to like give them his schedule, like no matter where you, where you're going, you know I'm going to go fishing, I'm going to be on this river.

Speaker 3:          00:58:26       Okay. We're going to show up, come down there, the river on a mountain bike, and uh, try to collect your pets or your blood. You have no idea what life is when they get tracked. The second, the second like that. Oh, it must be hard to fucking nightmare. What is this Jamie? They have an APP now so that they can check in. You type in like, oh my God. Oh my God. That's so crazy. That's so crazy. That's how far we have to go to keep people from doing steroids. Can I track them? Track them. Like you're going to follow them with a drone. When they came to my house, I was a criminal. I'd given up my right. That's, it's so fucking bizarre. And they would show up. This one dude had it out for me because I told you I put the, the fucking out the south during the pistol one time and I fucked them up. So now there's little southern guy would come to me, show up at my job.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       Fucking everywhere. Hmm. Like twice. I gave him pissed, but at least I got to talk to him. He said he wasn't a bad guy, he wasn't like a heavy at all. The one time I just wouldn't let them in. And then he followed me for a probation violation, but I proved that wasn't. That was at the airport and so yeah, it's when someone, I can't do it no more. I couldn't do that. That would put you in a weird position with that person. No, you have no idea. There's people who come out of prison, they put them in that situation and they fail and they go right back to prison and they'll tell you, I never want to be in a halfway house situation again because it's too, you know, it's not really freedom. It's not really freedom in a way, you know, at that level of sharing their weaning you off of freedom. That's why it's a halfway house. Right. So, okay, I'm at the gym. I leave work. I got to call them and say I'm headed over to a 10th planet HQ. What's the address? Six O two, whatever. And then as I'm leaving now, let's say you go, okay, we're going to go over across the street to get a protein shake and when you go over to their places closed, so he'd go next door or something like that. They can violate you for that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       Yeah, it's tough to, you know, no Bible. It's working, but it's working and it makes you accountable. Yeah. It makes you accountable. Important thing when you're, you're definitely gonna eliminate 90 something percent of the people that'd be willing to take a chance and take a steroid. But then there's always the possibility that there's people that are ahead of the curve, you know, like we can't think that, you know, all those times when they, uh, had that clear stuff. When Victor Conte was using that stuff on his athletes that was undetectable, they would call it the clear and then they figured out what the clear was and now now you can test for it. But back then nobody had a test for it. But once, once they find tests for whatever the fuck people are using now that are skirting around tasks, we're going to go, oh, we thought those guys were clean.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       Like there's going to be a certain percentage, whatever that percentage is, but it's 10 percent. There's always going to be a percent that's trying something. There's always going to be a percent that's willing to try something. It's just out of all the people that we know are clean, if there's 100 people, is it one guy that takes a chance and does something weird and then gets caught a few years later when they figured out a test for it might be fake. The coffee was taken into the different levels. Oh, he was in the sixth day. Yeah. Couple of. Yeah. And they, they would be out of your system. Yes. Yeah, in the sixth inning. Now let me ask you a question. I know you're not going to say, I know Jamie's been watching lately. Jamie, tell me the truth as pete rose been killing it lately. Tell me the truth.

Speaker 1:          01:02:04       He rose. What do you mean he'd been killed on national TV? Repeat Baseball player. What's he doing? He's doing like this analyzing, but they got him and Alex Rodriguez. Oh my God. They killed Joe Rogan. You've got this is 2016. Pete rose with a bow tie because pete rose. No matter I've never been mad at p rose. Remember Pete Rose was one of my heroes though. Pete rose my heroes. I've never gotten mad at Pete rose. He's human, but in a way how they treat them. But he was a junkie and he was a piece of shift for awhile. Like he was a gambling junkie, you know, he was a piece of shit for a while, but enough fees. Fucking Pete rose dog. He's, I'm telling you. I watched this show one night and I was dying. How funny. He is like how crazy is and they're going to keep them around Fox. I hope they fucking do well. Did you ever watch him? Joe? Anything? Look, that's classic. How old is Pete Rose Now?

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       Fifties or sixties. Sixties. I just feel bad that you know, there was a, all the speculation that he had done 75. Wow. Just. Yeah, there was all that speculation that he had, um, gambled on his own team, but I don't think that was ever shown. Listen, you have to assume I'm a gambling. You do me a favor. Jamie, can you put up for Joe Rogan? Can you put up pete rose against ron bone and the all star game? This is when you. I had to show people at a bar one that I go, you never know who pete rose is not. Let me just show you pete rose's. Pete Rose Tackles Ron. Boom. But the beauty of this, it's an all star game. You never saw this German now. Oh, look at you. You're beside yourself. Oh No, no, because I get allergies. Jesus. Shit. The afternoon. Oh, look at this. Look. All right. This is this guy. How he played like this guy wasn't American savage. Who's a barbarian? Charlie. This is crazy. This is still the look at it. Oh my God. He just took him out. He tells them don't ever blocked that fucking basic gun cock sucker. Oh, look at this shit. Like he was the last of the real fucking Americans. He fucked up yet I'm a gambler. And he wrecked that dude.

Speaker 1:          01:04:31       He literally tackled him. Oh my God. Full shoulder down. Now, here's the beauty. If you put on yelled at him, let me tell you something. Nineteen 73. I was 10 years old and I went to see the mets against the Cincinnati reds. I was in my fucking haven. It was the fucking all star game. It was the National League, uh, Eastern Conference. And he beat up. But housing the second I left there. Look at us. I left there. So fucking happy. I went there with my mom, my stepdad. We was sitting behind Tony Perez family and Pete rose is beaten up on bud house. And I left there with my fucking dickhead. That chicken pox. I had the chicken pox. I went to that game with the fucking chicken pox. So here's my question to you. How come this can happen today? How come the guy can't run into the guy at home base today?

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       That would be a suspension three months especially for suspension is nothing, right? Nothing. And that was one of the greatest. Look at that team right there. That's playing. That's one of the greatest. You'll never see anything like that. Yeah. That's New York City. This is fucking tremendous. Oh my goodness. This is awesome. What a fight to cut it off. What a terrible time to edit it. That was just. It was just getting good. Yeah. [inaudible] gotten a bunch of his fights, right? Fist fight to use to tackle you at second, but you know, he played baseball. He Played Cincinnati. Somebody would get hurt on Cincinnati. Reds and bench would automatically go to first and plumber would play like a plumber was like fucking God. And he sat by, you know, it was just a trump meeting with me and Goldberg get together. We talk about the Cincinnati reds because I grew up on him, but at this point I think I don't give a fuck about the hall of fame for Pete Rose.

Speaker 1:          01:06:16       I know he gambled on his own thing, but if you don't, if you know any history of gambling and professional sports, guess what? Joe Rogan, the role loses. They all lose a ton of money. Tons of money from arch leads to to fucking Pete rose. There was another one that used to bet on, you know, these arch leaf that didn't get caught betting on himself, but he, he, he's known to fucking lose everything. I'm professional gambling. These guys all called right from downstairs. The only thing, they're the only ones who did it. Is that what you're trying to tell me? I have a brother who's a fucking moron, but he's married to my sister and I know he's a dumb fucking loser gambler. I can't call him and say to him, listen, fucking Malique Shaw, his ankles hurt and tonight bet against them. You know, whatever. I can't.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       You know what I'm saying? I mean, a lot of fucking people do it. Pete rose, they hate him. He used to tell him, fuck you. When you play like that, what do you think? You don't think your rest of your life is telling people to go fuck themselves. Who does that in 1973 and an all star game doesn't mean anything. So the players didn't like him like that. He, he was against the fucking system like since day one. Then he went and he became a player when he was gambling on himself. He was a player manager. Supposedly. What's. Oh okay. A player manager, but me and my gambling mind, he been gambling the whole time. You know what I'm saying? That's not to say that it just, he just started gambling one day. He been gambling the whole time because in the seventies it was a little less frowned upon.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       What do you like to dad got this horse and the third. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And one day that basketball baton, that football bet becomes a baseball bat. Well, people had bookies were really common. Common. Everybody had a book. It's less common today. Yes. Today because everything's done on computers and people could do stuff like that. But, uh, 30 years ago, August, this skinny guy would look at the bar. You went to [inaudible] and that's the book that here, what do you want to do? You give them cash after three or four or five weeks starts letting you bet on credit. What do you think they're worried about? Why they keep gambling like that? Illegal. Do you think they're worried we're just going to go crazy. Just gambled all the money away. Like what are they worried about? Like why is it. Why? Why would you protect someone from gambling?

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       Wait you. Are you trying to keep people prosperous by removing the threat? They can't do it. So because they can't do it. A lot of people who'd fallen into gambling won't because we're going to protect them from themselves because that doesn't seem to make any sense to me. Some states look upon it like when I was a kid, no reasonable. My parents did numbers and the city is because they gave you a ticket in the city and a felony in jersey, so we'll wait a second. Joey would all those degenerate motherfuckers in the tristate area. What you're telling me is if you got arrested for gambling in New York City in the seventies and eighties, you got a ticket.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       The Cop said, what are we going to do? I've got a thousand of these motherfuckers popping apartment buildings all over the place. If you went to Harlem in the seventies, it was all little bodegas and everybody took action, whether it was numbers. The next, the Brooklyn number, the Roosevelt number. Remember there's five numbers that come out and fucking New York. They haven't told you. My grandmother got arrested. Yes. You run the numbers. You run numbers. It's something that you do in the neighborhood. You become a part of it. You gotta accept. Okay. For years. Okay. Everybody. Well, I did. I don't know about you. Once a month. Let's pump. Even if I over exaggerate once a month, somebody would pull me aside and go, hey man, you know anybody who wants to sneakers. What do you got? Yeah, I got commerce. Okay. They usually go for 20 for you. I'll give to you for seven. You don't even ask. You just know they're stolen. You know what I'm saying? I'm not going to embarrass you. You come to my house. You're my friend, right? Jo, you come to my house. Joe, how you doing? Hi. This is kind of embarrassing. My cousin, he owns a store and he's having a sale on TVS. I know it's 6:00, it's a little late, but the trend, the trends that 400 brand new, I need 100. They're in a box with a warranty. Christmas is coming.

Speaker 1:          01:10:16       You didn't ask him that. Stolen. That's a regular fucking day for a guy in Pittsburgh, Connecticut. Is that more of an east coast thing where people come to you with the open van? Well, I'm not an open van. I'm talking not people, not strangers. I'm talking about Jamie. Jamie and Jamie's got a cousin that gets watches. He gets the best watch in the world. My lamp on top $52,000. But Jamie get them to 22 cash. Went 2020 goals to the guy and Jamie gets to off the top. Are you going to torture Jamie and embarrassing like so when did you get this? Am I going to get arrested? No. Give him the 22 grand and move on with your fucking life. Right? Is that bad Karma? I who know. Buy Stolen goods? No, because Martha gets the insurance back from you and they get an even higher.

Speaker 1:          01:11:04       They get, they get the retail back. Don't even get the wholesale totally makes out. If you take it off, somebody is watching him put a gun to his head, then you've got to bump into something bad, right? The physical act of taking from a person's digital from no matter what this something involved, but you don't have nothing to do with it. Somebody shows up at your doorstep. It's two weeks away from Christmas. What a surprise. You have the Nintendo game my son wants, or the ps three or the PS. How much of those things brand new, much 300 brand new. I show up at your house for a buck and a quarter with three of them. You're going to take all three of them. I know a dude who thought he was buying a stereo, but he's actually buying bricks. He got one of those stereotypes that he's a footpath a moment.

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       He stopped at the street and bought it from a guy named Jamal. I had a guy. I was buying pet food. I pulled into this parking spot. I got out and this dude literally opened the van like he was going to take me in and fuck me. Like I was like some little kid. He was about to scoop up out of the woods and like it was a molester and I'm like, what? Like what do you, what do you got? And he's like, stereotypes, you want to buy a stereo? I was like, this is the weirdest. He's. He opened up the door like as people parked the car and like it was literally like, Hey man, you want some of this? Like what? You're asking for trouble if you do business. One of those guys, that's the most obvious shit ever. You know? He's just randomly trying to sell a stereo to the back of a van.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Now. What are these things that they do in whatever, like the people go when they have, what do they call junk at sea? When I was a trunk. It's. No, no, no, I'm sorry. The thing off the fucking five that you always see in the movies and all the fucking Friday, they all go to a place and they. They buy stereos and raider hats. Swap swap me. Oh yeah. Well in that way it's a swap me in Jersey that called, what do they call you? Market? Something like that. Yeah. I used to go to where they used to do the bicycles, whatever those street car races and next door to it they had whatever it was called and you'd go there and they had pretty much shit that was stolen. It was just a festival and they tries to a table fee because everything was 50 percent off. Even the sneakers I remember and then we found that that the guy would go to the fucking factory and jumped over the fence and take over the sneakers. No mistakes.

Speaker 1:          01:13:27       Irregulars. They would take those and just sell them at those for swap, swap meets, and then we find that we cut into his action. I just want it done. We, we, we cut into that action and the action, they're not going to. Those tubes are blocked best prank. They would throw thousands of amount with little things like the chemical was off. You start blinking too much, like the chemical would be off. Then it was pepper spray, pepper spray, like people would spray and you can see what happened. It's not regular but binocular. What does that tear gas. It was like the tickets.

Speaker 1:          01:14:04       The Spanish kid that was advertising and we make them jump the fence and we'd have thousands of tubes and we'd sell them for fifty cents a piece on Monday, the sixth and seventh grade virus, but there wasn't always three kids that complain. There was a little like the chemical imbalance was all delirious. Yeah. There's more shenanigans and the east coast it seems like, but no, you know, cut into that sneaker business who Ross Ross dress for less. All those companies that you go in the genes of 20 percent off because there's a regular stitch now. They became the fucking junkets for those. You know how you have a friend that has a bit and then that bit is always connected to that place. Like Ross dress for less is sebastian where every time you go to. Sometimes I'll even go to Ross because I think it's a bathroom.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       I mean that's like I can't see Ross dress for less. Ross dress for less. Does that a little bit about. Is this mountain the flip flops shoes pull shit off the shelf and just fuck it. Throws it down the aisle. That's a funny bit, but it's one of those. It just cemented in your head. If you think about Ross dress for less, like what are the. There's gotTa be other bits like that, right? Like okay, Roller Derby's or roller skating rinks. I take my daughter to a rollerskating things, a little party in a roller skating rink. Every skates around. You know what I think about Bret Ernst and it's crazy. Roller Skater bit. Remember that bit about the old dude. That was really good. That would go to the skating rink and skate backwards. It's fuck it was. I mean he, he isn't the east coast. Did you ever go rogue?

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       Escape that one of those places on Sunday with Guido and cousin vinny? No, I missed a lot of stuff because once I got into martial arts I didn't want to do anything that would hurt me outside of martial arts because I didn't want to get hurt. So I didn't want to ski. He didn't want to ride motorcycles, didn't. I didn't want to skate. I didn't rollerskate I didn't do it. I did an ice skate. I don't know how to ice skate. No, fuck you. I bowled. I got a bowling ball at some point in the game. That wasn't bad. I'd go to the Bronx and bowl. I rolled a skate if I went like three times in the seventh grade and like a Paramus, paramus, New Jersey, and like a roller rink. And it was the one that was just. Oh really? Staying alive and yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       You know, first I was afraid I was petrified he, Brett would do this bit and he would do it with music and they would flash the lights and shit and he would, uh, I don't want to give it away. I don't think he does anymore. But if you haven't seen it, go find it. If it's online somewhere, it's serious. I used to go to the one and I took me were older than I was and for me it was just to skate around for them. It was to pick up checks you following me and they would get all dressed up and shit and then they would roll around and if you want up to a girl and ask her to roller skate. That was the beginning of the relationship, that type of shit. And they played disco music and I went like three times. It wasn't for me, but the best thing.

Speaker 1:          01:17:12       I had a wig and he fell and the weight fell off everybody surrounding them. And that was my highlight of the fucking roller skating rink. I never went back to the this game. What did you know? They, you just. Did you have a point in your life where you knew that you were going to be a comic? Did you have like a. But did you ever like look back at moments like that where the guy falls down, his wig falls off and it's a fucking your favorite part of the day? No, that's. That was the whole thing like you left irrational. I love laughing. Yeah, I know you do. I love laughing at the fucking most absurd. Like when I saw a guy get him on a snowball in New York City on a bus, like when people throw snowballs at each other and I was in the back of the bus and this guy sat in the area where people get hit with snowballs and the window was open.

Speaker 1:          01:18:02       I don't mind. This motherfucker's going to get hit. I'm going to forget. It was like Deja Vu and all of a sudden sitting in the back of the bus and this guy's happy. He's talking in Italian, blah, blah, blah, blah. He was like a tourist. He was a tourist Italian and it was the day after the storm and these coasts where it's sunny out and that snow's melting, but kids are rapping. I don't have school and they're throwing snowballs. I got to the boulevard and this guy gets on the bus, doesn't close the window. Rule number one. Soon as you can in those Kennedy Boulevard, you closed the fucking window track because there's an area. Then it becomes like apocalypse now. Then when they threw spears, then when they went on the lake and launched and they got really fucked up, they started getting hit with speeds. That's how I would get hit with snowballs and I saw at Joe Rogan, that guy sitting down laughing and all of a sudden you can hear the right in the fucking face and knocked them off the chair.

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       He was in the aisle seat and he went into the middle and he got up and he kept saying stop, but the bus stop or the bus and I'm fucking island with my little buddies in the back, you know, Shit like that. You cannot write like, like as a child, the things you saw like the time I went to the haunted house, they take you to like, oh, bring them teen castle haunted house. Me and a bunch of little white Italian kids were crazy but wouldn't nice people. But like three of us thought we were bad at. I'm bad boy. We didn't know is that night east orange was coming to one of those black neighborhoods and they got off the bus and were walking behind them that I seen one of the kids just start wailing on Dracula, just beat my drag. When you're 13 and you think you're a bad motherfucker, but some do the beat and Dracula and the Brigham, Teen Castle, you can't write that shit light.

Speaker 1:          01:19:47       That'll stay with me forever. Seeing that in the haunted house. Till this day I don't go to haunted houses because some these kids beat up dracula. Then they were pulling them out, Joe Rogan and kicking him and shit. Nobody in the other goals are trying to help him. This only happens in Jersey. You can't describe these animal experiences while we were just talking about what happened at a rangers game. Oh yeah. Before we you. You were talking about this before the podcast. I'm glad you brought that up, but about the raiders come into Vegas and he retired. What happened recently? The raiders game, Jamie, where some guy got beaten into a coma. Critical.

Speaker 4:          01:20:23       Well, this was an earlier this month, October. It was in critical condition after a ravens, raiders game, 30 percent chance to survive and two guys got arrested. Yeah, they just beat him up. Yeah. They didn't know what the story was at the time of this was written. It was unclear why the altercation started. They just started fighting on their way out the game. Tom knows then who knows what happened if that's the case, but it two on one, but I mean who even knows what happened? Who knows what we're talking about the violence that these games from Russia came to this. Is that a preseason at a game? At the coliseum. Just fans brutally fighting. It's happened all. All, all the time. I like any stadium, just pick a stadium. Just going to be fights there basically.

Speaker 1:          01:21:08       Oh my God, this is crazy. This guy just dragged this guy that this other guy was beaten up. He dragged the guy over the top of the stairs and then he started beating him up. Oh my God. This is crazy. This is insane. And there's no security. Where the fuck is security? Well, the preseason game with the rams, there was no this, this happened and something else happened. So I guess the rams didn't want to pay up and the city didn't want to pay up, but I guess the rams ended up having to pay up the security at these games. Now. A raiders games particularly violent or is it all sports games? Well, at this point, who the fuck really knows? There's a couple dodger games and then not violent at all. What about shit will philly in the old days? I don't know about this new stadium now with all the. In the old days that was getting out of the hell quick time. Even at the fucking court downstairs. But uh, over the last couple of years it's like they fucked people up. You're just not getting into a push fight. Two cops coming between you. It's like three guys beating up on it. These fucking events. You're going there with your children to watch a football game. He hit. Do you know a guy tried to two men get prison for dodgers stadium?

Speaker 4:          01:22:22       Jesus Christ, pretty sure after fight after baseball game. Oh Man,

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       God damn it. Well this guy was the one that they, he had a blood clot and they couldn't find the killers. So they went to the tape. I mean they narrowed it all the way down to the tickets for a stupid fucking game. Listen, I could go to a game and have a good time and yell and scream and get three bids and all sudden like, oh yeah, like the giants and the cowboys. Ah, that's it. Yeah. But now it's like people come up to you and punch in the fucking head if you like somebody else or if you're walking into the stadium that team lost and you have that shirt on. But if it's the certain. Do certain teams have like a fan mentality? You know, like there's certain teams and other sports with like

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       doesn't Manchester United? Jamie knows something about soccer, right? Don't they have like a certain, like rabid

Speaker 4:          01:23:11       fan personality, hooligans. This menu, I think it's allowed each team over there, they all have their little sect, their club and they just kinda bought Brah. I don't know just what they do and not just in college football also at these stadiums. I never. They don't, they just, just this year I think a lot of drinking in some stadium. The college it was up until maybe like a year or two ago. You weren't even allowed. I just went to a game at Ohio stadium. They should allow them to drink and you're only allowed to get like beer maybe even so like there's no liquor but that's just there. I don't know how it is all over the tailgate and Joe Rogan. That's where the damage is done for sure. But don't allow them to keep the party rolling while they're up in the stands on your will stop after like half time in some places. Years ago. I know stadium stopped in the third quarter. Art, our

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       discussion this morning was about the building, the stadium right across from the Mandalay Bay, like with the, the thinking of building and I'm like, you know, man, a fucking Sunday to get outta here now. Let me ask you this. Is there a benefit to keeping like if they say if they bought a team that's for sale, like the raiders, let's just say the raiders, is there a benefit to keeping that name or is there a benefit to stardom? It's going to be in Las Vegas. Benefit to changing the name will. They're going to call them the Las Vegas raiders, but because of what people call it with a Brendan, it's the raiders. They're going to keep the radios and they'll keep the black and silver and the whole. I mean wide changes. The whole mentality now they're in fucking right now where they were in Vegas. That's so crazy. They're going to be in Vegas and this is their stadium.

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       Las Vegas Committee Sends Raiders Stadium Plan to Governor. It looks insane. I'll tell you what, man, I've never been to a live football game. Not a big ass crazy nfl game, but I could only imagine. The energy must be insane. It must be insane when you get a 100,000 people screaming at the top of their lungs. When some shit goes down, it makes you wonder, man, what it would have been like to see the colosseum in Rome. I mean imagine what that must have been like. And with real blood, real blood's got chopped swords and shit. Russell Crowe strapping motherfuckers. It's like that is the same. We will looking at it essentially it's the same progression from like Pete rose to today's baseball, you know, versus like gladiators to like some crazy football game. It's like it's just, there's just, there's no way we want to slide back that sword fighting shit again.

Speaker 3:          01:25:41       If that would be the one thing like yeah, you can't do that. One thing I noticed the last couple of weeks because you know, during the year I don't really sit and watch baseball. It's around the world series that I'll watch a game. So the other thing, the green room, we're watching it now, they even have like Joel pieces, jaw piece, tons of protection now like. So if you're batter of you get hit with a ball. Yes. So if you're a battery or a right handed batter, your, your helmet now comes down to here. So all you could see as the ball. Oh, that's weird. So if the blue. Yeah, some of these jaw got broken or something like that. They're looking to protect your pete rose's game. He was a fucking gladiator. But when I was a kid, I remember that's when that guy, Tony Conigliaro, is that his name, the guy who got hit with a ball.

Speaker 3:          01:26:29       Who's the guy that got hit with a ball? He was a big player in the Boston Red Sox. You got hit with a ball and was never the same again. And Sam wasn't a fucking. I was a baseball fan until I started martial arts, so till I was like 14 or 15 and uh, I forget the story, but I remember thinking, man, I did not know a baseball could fuck you up that bad. This guy was essentially net Tony Conigliaro. Yeah, that's it. So he got hit with his baseball and he was just never the same again. And he was a star player before he got hit and sort of never recovered. Was All fucked up afterwards. But that, um, I don't remember when he died, but I believe he died young, 90 an hour, 80 year, state even faster. I mean, some guys like Roger Clemens. What would you throw in his prime in the 800? You know, this was the seventies, right? Yeah. So the eighties, they still weren't the, you know, it was still growing. Ada. I mean the technology might have been a little wrong, you know, steroids, they weren't a lot of steroids. So many. So you have to just still. Yeah, still. Yeah. You had to. Um, what were you going to say, Jamie?

Speaker 4:          01:27:44       The guy closes for the cubs that pitches last night. Chapman, he's throwing 102 miles an hour. Fast balls on Sunday. That was fast. It breaks bats and shit. And that's so fast. That hits your kneecap at that one. It just shattered it. Let's chat. Is it

Speaker 3:          01:28:06       crazy ability, you know, I mean, you have ability to take a baseball bat and base our baseball rather and just basically held something in the head. You could throw it like that guy. I could throw a baseball at a dog and Kol, like if you want it to that kind of accuracy and speed, you know, they think that might've been one of the reasons why human beings evolved like that. Our brains evolved. That was one of the considerations. So they're trying to figure out which what causes the brain to double. Our brain doubled over a period of 2 million years. Apparently it's, it's just giant mystery. They don't know why. There's a bunch of thoughts as to why did it. People started eating more meat, started cooking their meat. They get get them more access to nutrients, but another weird one is they think it might've had something to do with the throwing arm. Then when people figured out that they could pick stuff up and throw it at something that they started getting clever and that's when they started devising

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       solutions to problems and it gave them more access to food because they could kill animals better. So they were throwing rocks like squirrels and shit and eating them. So what you mean to tell me it's on its own. Our brain has doubled in size over a period of 2 million years. The human brain doubled, was a long met. None of that was a long time ago. Oh yeah. But there's more information. There was no books back then. There was during the time that human brain doubled. We were basically going from these, uh, you know, more primitive hominids to becoming a human being. And then there was a sort of a period where things move along at a fairly slow pace, but then all of a sudden something explodes over what seems like a long time, but 2 million years is not that long in evolutionary terms. So something happened when we were some sort of monkey creature and during that time there was a change where we mutated in our brain, doubled in size and we became way more sophisticated.

Speaker 2:          01:30:00       No Fun. The Fun Shit is to think that that was aliens. The Fun Shit is to think that aliens came down and uh, you know, put sperm and a monkey or did some tests with, you know, took one of the early primates and added alien DNA to it and dropped it back off. And that's why the brain got so big so quick. But it's, we've figured some shit out, man. And the people that didn't figure it out, they didn't live, you know, we probably figured out high spaces keep you away from cats, got to climb up high. You got to figure out how to invent weapons. You gotta like soft. Like we, we didn't. Uh, we didn't get the fangs. We didn't get the claws, but we've got the crazy brain and we went to crazy brain option over 2 million years somehow or another for whatever reason it grew.

Speaker 2:          01:30:44       It's pretty nuts when you think about it because every other animal on this fucking planet is basically like. There's some advanced animals like chimps and dolphins and some other advanced animals, you know, that we think are real smart, like octopus when we're not exactly sure how their little brains work. But when it comes to doing the kind of shit that we can do to the planet, which we fly, we changed the temperature of buildings. We project video, you know, we, we can film things in real time and then show them seconds later on this little tiny thing that slips right into your pocket. I mean we're, we're on some weird complete different level than everything that exists in terms of if maybe not far, not our actual overall intelligence, our ability to change our environment. It changed space around us. There's nothing like us, man. That's who knows what the fuck cause that they don't know. Transplant candidate thinks it's mushrooms, so he thinks, thinks there's a, it's called the stoned ape theory. He thinks he's ancient monkeys, found some mushrooms, atum and then,

Speaker 5:          01:31:57       well blah blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       Got In tune with the mother. Joined Diaz sometimes to kind, kinda leave me the fuck alone. He's dead. Who gives a fuck? He's dead. Fuck. I'm talking about 2007 thing if one, lesson chimp with acid. Anyway, we're talking about doubling of the human brain. How the fuck did we even get onto that? Who the fuck knows? He just came out of it. I'm dealing with these sprays and shit. You can't scare me like this shit on a fucking doing a 50 milligram Brownie and you've got to hit me with these stories about the human brain pictures. That's TMZ. That's what happened. People want to listen to TMZ and they need fucking more a space. Like when you got your computer after a month you realize what the fuck? I need more space. I got born, I got a UFC, I got, you know, the family, you know, we run on a hard drive space.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       We need space. It's very important for ourselves, you know, will get stronger. We'll get fucking bigger. Look at these kids in football now. They're fucking huge. These kids that, these animals, these kids. Yeah. How, when we're talking about the difference in baseball pitchers quit baseball players back then were throwing what was like a super fast Nolan Ryan, Nolan, probably the fucking throwing to eat since day one. That fucking guy. And uh, how fast did he throw? Like it'd be 90, but you figure you take a guy that pitches 85 were good control. Okay, well I'm talking about gun control is I can hit any other nine Elvis's every time I pitch right from how far away is like 60 slash 60 feet? 60 point six inches. Okay. So you take one of those guys don't through what we have today. You know, you put them with.

Speaker 1:          01:33:39       What's the guy that we would think really highly of Marinovich yeah. Marble intervention. Okay. You put them with like, I'm a really rich guy that strengthen those fucking all those muscles that they haven't figured out before. You know that, that that's quick. You know, how long do those guys last? Jamie? Few years. But Nolan Ryan, he lasted a long ass time. Yeah, but they had to take the surgeries and the surgeries to have that type of, you know, because it's not just your arm. Okay, let's pull. It's not yours. It starts when you picked that fucking leg up. When you pick that leg up, the energy of that leg on your own time, not the next time you smoke a joint. Late night, you know, insomnia, just and put up the 10 best pitches and look what that front leg does and how that front leg also controls that time.

Speaker 1:          01:34:30       There's a pitcher now that pitches for Chicago that you switched sitting there and you're waiting for the ball. The foxy door. What the fuck? They already have flopped because it's a fuckin angle. It still leg. He pops it out. He drops the ball. It's that whole body technology in there. So there's a guy, there's a fucking dude with glasses and Iowa right now. I got the training for this right or wrong, you know the major league right now doesn't give a fuck about strengthening your arm and all that. How can we take my guy from 98 to one? Oh, four. And have them be able to throw at one. Oh, 4:20 pictures the most. Hm. And I'll just put them in every three games to just kill motherfuckers. Do you understand me in the seventh inning when you're getting momentum in comes this guy that throws one on fourth and he's going to throw it's nine pitches.

Speaker 1:          01:35:29       He's going to throw 12 pitches and you're out of there. I really don't because remember, the faster the ball comes in, the faster the ball goes out. Always remember that too. If you live by the sword, you die by that motherfucking sort of. Somebody hits a home run. It's because he popped the 98 motherfucker that made a mistake and put it in who? Loeb and his gorilla, because that's all it determined. It's just A. It's like a game of inches. He just dropped it. It just dropped a little bit too much for one of these fucking things. Now on the other side, you got to Marinovich that comes in and takes that guy that batch to 90, keeps them healthy, give some conditioning stuff out of the shoulder. What's the recovery? Because the recovery in that game is the whole game, Joe, right? The recovery is the whole thing and this fucking along those guys.

Speaker 1:          01:36:21       Two or three years later, that's too much on that. All those 10 meets the surgery. Will the shoulders alone muscles combined and to throw that particular look how many muscles I have involved, especially if it come look at this, try this on your own and I had no flexibility. It's got to go at least all the way the fuck back this and as that leg drops, look what that arm it has to come in. Perfect. Perfect. Over the top and then down across and now the follow through is the most important. Yeah, it's got to come. And that's a thing for if you throw a ball like a girl, and I don't mean like a girl knows how to throw a ball, but you know what I'm talking about. If you throw a ball and spastic like as Steven Seagal. Yeah, people will never respect you. It's a real issue like you, you could suck it a lot of stuff. You could suck at basketball. How about this? You could suck at like throwing a free t three a free throw and people laugh. Ha ha ha ha. But if you throw the first pitch and you throw that like some uncoordinated spazz, if you hit this fucking first pitch, dark it off the ground like you're a loser. Like there's a. there's a harshness like people get. It's like some school yard shit

Speaker 4:          01:37:37       you just said free throat. You reminded me of something I saw. I haven't heard anybody bring this up yet. Someone made stevie wonder shoot a free throw and they have it on video. Did he nail it? No. He missed it. Well obviously terribly, but I don't know how this movie and you don't want to let him know he missed it. They could have all just played along and made it. Someone should have caught it. The other said dropped a ball

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       right through the net.

Speaker 3:          01:38:01       They given another shot. It's just says it over and over again. But Oh, why don't they just let him figure it out where it is. If he keeps throwing it, how long do you think it would take before we figured out where it is? A long he wouldn't even know how to install it. That's terrible that they even did this as well. If there was no one in the room and you could get, let him use like echolocation what he yelled out. Hello with this beautiful voice. Hello. Maybe you could figure out, you know, because deaf guys apparently are blind guys rather apparently can do that to a certain extent. Like they hear sound bounce off things, you know, how far away things are. But how would he know where the net is if you put my waist right in front of it? If you go.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       The thing is 15 feet. Right? Exactly. From us right now. Stevie, I'll be under them that you just keep going into your head. You fucking hit it. Success. What's the concept of 15 feet to a guy who was blind, you know? Do you think he lost 10 feet in the air? Right? Ten feet in the air? Yeah, that's A. Yeah, I was going to figure that out. I just never thrown anything before either. But that's not embarrassing. I mean, especially at Stevie wonder's blind. But if even if it was a regular guy that sucked at basketball and through a free throw, it would be funny. Be Stupid. But funny, but if you fucking missed that first pitch, if they ask you, hey joey, I hear you're going to be in town, you want to throw out the first pitch for the game. They're like, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:24       I used to play a lot of baseball when I was a kid. I'll fucking do that. You go out there. I'll full of piss and vinegar. You want. I wouldn't even. I wouldn't make 60 feet. Right? There is no way. Oh yeah. Gary Dell bought day from the stern show. Here. He goes, no way. I would make 60 feet right here it goes. Let's see what he does. Oh, they're good. They're all talking about it. Like it's an event. Maybe one of the worst ones ever. Here it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He throws it and they don't show you. They actually hear it goes throw it. Oh my God. It didn't go anywhere near him.

Speaker 3:          01:40:02       Yeah. He completely missed to make it any worse than it is though, because it went all the way to the catcher. Right? Yeah. Yeah. You should get made fun of him for sure. They'd been making fun of him. That's why there's a whole piece about this, but do you think. You said this is what happens when you get made fun of this is what happens when you throw like that. Oh, for sure. You get made fun of. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were saying that he missed because he gets made fun of like they've destroyed his confidence to the point where you can't throw a baseball. I get it. It's a good point though. There's something about throwing. Oh, see, they have the worst first pitches ever. Yeah. Ip in that. I'd be in that for sure. I can't really throw the ball. I tried Puma football a couple months ago. Reference. Horrific. Really? Football. It's gone. Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       this guy's had in my shoulders is gone. I'm living on fucking smoke and my shoulders. There's nothing in there. I don't know how they're not hurting me. There's nothing in there. I don't think so. Did you get an Mri? What? I'm going to waste their fucking time. What can you not do with it? Can you put your arms over your head? Flexibility. You know, my flexibility is halfway there. I can't do flies anymore. That type of shit. You know, the thing that helps me a lot now is the bat the way that bats are great. You know, why aren't you taking that guy's a kettlebell classes at, uh, the Jujitsu school. You go to Joe, Joe, Joe Alvarado. Yeah. Yeah. I've been told is a kettle Jujitsu, Jujitsu. Bad Ass man. I've seen his instagram video, right? Dude, man. I went in there the other day and I want in there a little early.

Speaker 1:          01:41:44       They have class at 12 and it wasn't doing anything. I want to net 11. There's usually some guys when I was messing around with some guy and my professor Alvarado is, let me teach you something joey, that's perfect for you. And he stayed with me for 30 minutes and we just worked this half guard sweep that was just tremendous. Joe Rogan. Simple shit for a fat dude. You know what I'm saying? Like, uh, they teach that old manage it, so it's just less movement and get the job done effectively. He's a great dude, but he, we worked in off of a. At first he goes, Joe, you're gonna have a problem with this. Let's get a Kettlebell and working off of a Turkish got. It'll be a lot easier for you to develop the movement. There was basically, boom, get the under hook, grab the arm and just flip over that.

Speaker 1:          01:42:28       But he turns it very, uh, he's a good man. So when you do Turkish getups, it doesn't bother your shoulder. I could do a Turkish get up to the point. Like for, I can't lie. I can't do point. You can't get to the fifth part. Boom here to the top. Okay. So you don't ever stand up all the way? No, no, no. Okay. So you just hip up and you have the from my hip. I do more my hands to be honest with you. The shoulder, like I said, that little weighted bat is tremendous, but it. Let me ask you this. Is it. I'm the reason why you don't get up. Is it because of the weight or your shoulders? It's my weight and the weight. It's the weight on the shoulders combined. Well, you know what, you can do the model. No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          01:43:08       I can do the leg thing and go from there. No, no, I'm good that that's one thing, but what I'm saying is with the, especially with the Turkish get up, like people underestimate the benefit of doing it with even know. Wait like you just doing it as a posture. Just lying on your back, straighten your arm up and going through all the motions, propping up on your elbow, you know, going up on the hip, you know, hoisting your hip hop lyft net, one leg, getting an underneath you, standing up straight and then fully standing straight with your arm extended. If you just go through that series of motions have been carrying a Kettlebell. That's an professor. Alvarado is Walmart. He does that with no. No, no Kettlebell. No. That's good. Just that as a warmup. I mean people don't it if you don't

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       move your body around a lot like that, it's hard to move your body around like, you know what I started doing recently that I haven't done it forever. Jumping rope. I started jumping. I fucking love it. It's hard to. Yeah, it's hard to. Minutes is 20 minutes of jogging to. It's hard to do three minutes like around like in between like a set, the boxing timer and I do three minutes. It's fucking hard. It's hard. You're like this shit. He feel pretty good and then about 30 seconds and you're like, oh, I gotta fucking concentrated here. I've got to make this. I'm feeling it in my feet started hurting. I'm like, oh, this is one of those things. If you don't do it, you think it's easy and then once you do it, you realize are you going to get in shape for this too? Like everything else.

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       Your body's not used to jumping around like that point and going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going, don't do anything. But if you can do it, I would imagine there'll be tremendous for your footwork and you free your agility and your foot strength and all the strength in, in all those connecting ligaments because essentially what you're doing is little tiny plyometrics. You know, you're jumping, you're not, you're not getting full extended explosion movements, but you're getting these little jumping bounces where you know, you're, you're with me. I'm 196 or something like that and 196 pounds going, going, going, going, going on my feet. That's great for you. You know, it develops real strength in your feet. I got sore in weird places for like three weeks when I first started putting to rankle yeah, my ankle. My calves got super tight, like it was really fucking up my kickboxing because I would try to kick and I'd be worried that like my calf was going to lock up.

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       Like it was real sore, like a in a, in a way that, uh, I thought I was hitting with those Hindu squats and I like to do. I think I thought that was hitting my calves and up. I guess not. There's no substitution for that little bouncing. You know where I got it from him, Lance Armstrong's podcast. I was listening to Lance Armstrong's podcast and he was talking about his son being friends with. He's friends with Brett farve and Brett farve came to his house in the son plays football, so he asked his son, he goes, Hey, do you skip rope? Like this is the first thing he asked, and he had talked to some other guy who was also some big time football player, big time football coach rather, and he's like, do skip rope and the kids. And he said, no. So you got to skip rope and the same thing Brett Farve said you got to skip rope.

Speaker 2:          01:46:13       Like there's something about jumping rope that for like footwork and movement. And so I said, all right, I'm going to start doing that and right away I realized like God damn it, how come I haven't been doing this forever? I should have been doing this forever. Open everything. I got one of those everlast while my daughter go and do a layer on top ones and she left it out there one day and I go, let me try this old school. I do like 32 seconds at those. Did you rip your feet apart? No. That's one thing that I got those cube does it have for going feet. That'll fuck around Jack. This was coming up when I was a kid. Everybody

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       you talked to tell you how to jump rope. I used to jump rope at night with no weights. Basketball workout was 20 slash 30 minutes of jumping rope and then I would sit on the wall, just sit to condition my thighs. Twenty, 30 minutes. That was it. Yeah. That wall sit thing. That was always big. And Karate schools was a big wolf. Say the spine to the wall. Had a wall looking straight ahead. If you could do it, you know, you a little. But then they did horses. Horses in class. Always motherfuckers that would sit there and go 20 minutes. What?

Speaker 1:          01:47:24       I think it's probably better to run stairs. I'm uh, I'm on the run stairs. Are you really running them to know I have hills near my house, you know, hills near my house. I do some sprints up those on occasion. Fairly rare. But um, the thing that I like about that though is that it's like you're exploding your body forward. I think like that static hold of like a, there's benefits to that for sure, but I just don't think he can fuck with plyometrics. Essentially what you're running a hill, you're essentially dealing like one legged plyometrics. You're just exploding, exploding, exploding for the workout that you do. When the Diet you do, they say that you have to recommend running once a week. Sprints that primal diet, they say absolutely like 10:40 yard sprints. It's good for you. I'm a 40 year, I believe. I just need a heart attack at this point in my life.

Speaker 1:          01:48:15       For Awhile I was going crazy when I couldn't find that. Figuring out the cardio. Why wasn't breathing? I would go into that fucking north Hollywood park, walk around with a farm. It was kettle bell and then I would like do 10 sets of swings and they'll go let me try some fucking sprints and that would do it. Not realizing like, what the fuck am I doing? I could pull something here that can then retain. This isn't just a fucking, you know, like you know, you're not warmed up properly for that shit. Right. I remember going to track as a kid because they tried to tell me during the off season basketball players with a high jump to stay in shape and we had this guy real wolf and I read wolf was the one of the assistants at the fucking Olympics. Great Guy and you know he was at the bend squats.

Speaker 1:          01:48:57       That was this big fucking squats to get the fuck. Yeah. I'll go down on the squad and popping into jumping rope and those fucking spreads. And we used to run hills in north Bergen because it's the second hill. He is fucking, you know, that's a nightmare type shit. I'm good. No running hills. It's hard, but you know, it's the hardest shit. Running sand dunes run in sand dunes is dark death. That's you just legs have nothing. They're going through that sand and you're barely making progress. Listened my fight with Shane car. We've got canceled because I don't need the fucking dudes. All right. Where's Shane Shankar? When going? Shane? Carolyn's going to rising. Okay. Yeah. He couldn't take it no more on the silence. He's like, fuck it. I guess he wants to have some fun while he's still Shankar, when I salute that he could still hit

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       hard in a month. Did you see that? Jason knows fight. Do you see what crazy Jason Ellis did? Jason Ellis fought Shane Carwyn with one hand tied up or Shane Karlyn had his right hand tied up to his body and so Jason, I was like, you don't realize how big Shane car is. Like Jason knows is not the tiniest guy. You know. He's probably about 200 pounds. Who is standing next to Shankar when it is almost comical. How will you this? Look how big car one is.

Speaker 3:          01:50:14       I mean, he's a giant. He's a fucking giant and he's got one arm tied up. Look at this and he looks good dude. Like physically he looks jacked like he hasn't fought in a while, but obviously he's been working out. I mean he looks better than he did the, did the last time I saw him. The last time I saw him he was recovering from some injuries and he was still in the UFC. So apparently he's a free agent and I think, you know, he's, he's fighting for rise and I'm pretty sure, I mean, I know we put it on his instagram page, but uh, he came to man, he really kind of wrong. Oh, that was one. That was one punch. Did he hit him with that wasn't even the punch that, that chaos is it?

Speaker 3:          01:51:05       No, that, that was like at the end of a round I think. See, this is where it came from right here. So that was the second one. I mean that one really came, I'm like, you could see when he was down he was like, fuck, I mean that guy is so goddamn big Carlin's as gigantic human. So they were talking about setting him up with fader, like fate or versus car one. I don't know if that's gonna happen, but if that does, I'm in, I'm in, I'm paying to see that. That's a dangerous fight for fader now was writing for a dangerous Pfizer. Japan. Okay. So essentially the same guy who is in charge of a pride for awhile. Yeah. And uh, I believe so. And so, uh, if he goes over and fights, if Karlyn goes over and fights in Japan and he fights fade or as a giant fight, afraid offered, fought fabio Maldonado and barely squeaked by a fight, a lot of people thought that he should have lost you got hurt.

Speaker 3:          01:52:07       Fabio Maldonado tagged them in it. There's no shame in that. Fabio, Fabio Maldonado is a very good boxer. He rocked glover to Sherra before glover finished him off. And, uh, it was just tough shit. He's a tough, tough guy. They always call that poor guy in like they always Fabio's life. Who are we going to get fired? Well, who will be this fucking wacky to fight? I should know this. Fabio. Mom, do you remember how he saved that fight in Australia somewhere in Brazil some way. Steve Bay and heavyweight steep emile chick when Steve Bay's just fucking tearing through the ranks, right? Steve Bay's trying to get a shot at the title and he fights Fabio Maldonado. It just, I mean, Steve Ages ran through them. It was horrific. And Steve Bay's a scary guy as a heavyweight. And Fabio Maldonado just was not the same size, just did not belong in there with them, you know, just too big, too strong, too fast.

Speaker 3:          01:53:02       It's too hard. It was so scary fight. But um, when you think about Fabio Rockin fader and hurting him in his last fight and you think good lord would, if he gets hit by a car when like car car when takes a great shot and he hits harder than anybody in the division. He's, he's probably, he's probably one of the scariest heavyweight punchers ever. Literally ever when he fought mere, I remember he tied near up in a clench and just ripped up or cuts to his chin, his face and put them down and just beat them down when you're on the ground. Like car could fuck in Ponch scary puncher man. So if he's healthy like he looks like and that video, it looks fucking healthy to me and he looks huge. It looks like he's like, well over to 60. Yeah. I don't know if fader, I don't know if that's the kind of fight he wanted to stage of his life, you know, after he fought Maldonado, he might be looking to fight smaller heavyweights.

Speaker 3:          01:54:00       He might be looking to fight bigger names, will actually Carmen's pretty God damned big name as far as the free market. But who knows what's going to happen, man. You know, with um, one of the crazy things with all these new organizations, whether it's one FC, whether it's uh, you know, fill in the blank Bella tour, rise in all these other, like everyone is scrambling to pick up anybody who leaves the UFC so of people's contracts are up. I like, they're starting to do and they start bolting over and go into these other different organizations. Stuff can get crazy, like things can heat up and you might see like another pride ufc type of rivalry, which I think would be great for everybody. Like if rise and really does take off, like if rise inputs on fate or versus shame Darwin. And then they come up with a bunch of other crazy fights for the undercard. You know, just there's just not right now the same level of talent available outside the UFC. Not right now, but man, it's been close a few times and it used to be, you know, obviously it used to be with pride.

Speaker 3:          01:55:08       It's hard making something like that happen, you know, I feel with like a Shane Carbon for example. Shannon Cullen was a great father. He hasn't been thrown a punch in how many years? Um, he hasn't fought MMA since. I want to say it's two years ago, two, three years. The in my world, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not the professional here, but I think the UFC marketing would know they could do something with Shane. They passed on them. Maybe there's something they could do. The heavyweight division is packed. I don't know. I don't know the parameters of this. Yeah. You know, I like when a fighter hasn't

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       fought more than a year or two or maybe even three. I think about comedy, Joe Rogan and I think about if I just didn't do any here for three years, what would I be ready for? What would you, you didn't do any comedy for three years, what would you honestly booked yourself for? And fucking December. It's October 30. First, what would you book yourself on December the garden? You know, you do like the laughing skull in Atlanta. Okay, nice. A cool intimate little room. Very quiet and Cedar might not have a lot of money and the rise in might have offered them a big channel. I understand all these parameters, but I'm saying to you is, you know, it's like the GSP thing that was going on and maybe they weren't what they were and I think even as a fighter to three years, shit is fucking changed.

Speaker 1:          01:56:36       Yes and no. Yes and no. Here's the. No, depends on if you're still training, see if you decide to take some time off because you have nagging injuries or some fighters like that. Joseph Valtellina guy we were talking about earlier, he stepped back because of concussion syndrome because he was getting. He, you know, he had too many hits to the head and so he recognized it was having some real symptoms and he said no after resigned. So he gave up his belt and taking two or three years off. If you're having any sort of real problem, maybe if you've got a reoccurring back injury, which I know Shane had some bad habits. He had surgery for. Yes. So maybe taking that time off. So it was junior dos Santos was his last loss and that was UFC 1:31 and wow. Two thousand 11. So that's five fucking years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:57:20       Almost five and a half years ago. Guy's the heavyweight division, has come and gone in five years. That's a lot. People want to come back and now two, one slash 70. One 70 has come and gone. Tyrone Woodley is the champion and one of the boy's number one. These kids weren't even around when GSP fucking dropped off. Our Tyrone Woodley was. Well not Stephen Tom. I mean it's a whole breath of fresh air that comes into it is I think when Michael Bisping was pretty smart trying to get GSP to fight him in Toronto. Still at Man. Fuck yeah, that's a great one. I don't know if George wants to fight at one 85. I think George has even said that he could make 1:55, you know, the difference between the size of guys today versus the way they were then. It's no guys are way more sophisticated about weight cutting and I don't think George lifts as much weights anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:58:12       I don't think it's as big as it used to be. Who the fuck knows, man? You know, I don't. If the guy wants to compete, the game moves, moves very fast. [inaudible] has moved so much in two, three years that, you know, they got a lot of these people that are watching UFC eat. They don't even really know who Shane Koyczan one is. We've got a whole new batch of audience that's coming. That is true. Even with GSP, I'm a fan of GSP. I love to see him fighting it, but I had to ask myself questions. I was

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       like, I don't want to learn. It's like watching a fucking shark tank. You know what I'm saying? You want to learn. Well, I think the UFC is argument as far as what I had heard and this is all that shit I read online. I don't. I don't talk to the UFC interested, we read different dumb shit, but they there, what I'd read online was that they were not in agreement with how much money was going to cost to promote a fight with them and that the people that watched the fight today that are fans of Ronda Rousey and the fans Ican, conor mcgregor and all these current UFC fighters that maybe these fans that have only been fans for a couple of years, they kind of forgot what I was thinking three years run the party, but she don't think that it would take one, one fucking promotional special.

Speaker 3:          01:59:25       One thing they do on Fox or people remember just watch some of the fucking epic fights with John Fitch, with Bj, Bj Penn, you know, watch him submit Matt Hughes when Matt Hughes at the top of the world, watched him beat down Matt Serra after Matt Serra stomped him and won the title. You watch some of those fights and then you hear him talk and see what a gentleman he is. Come on, man. Come on guys. Golden. I love him to Golden. Even the foreign names you mentioned that fucking dying. This was. I agree. You know what? I think a guy like gsps to do, he's got to do a tune up fight. I really believe that. I think that would help everybody. I think that's what you would do in boxing. The only one that never did that as sugar ray Leonard went out of retirement right to Marvin Hagler. Oh right, right in there.

Speaker 3:          02:00:13       Just jumped right into Marvin fucking hagler and everybody was like, you're crazy. You need a tune up fight. And apparently he had some gym. Fine. So they set up some smokers in the gym just sorta like we were talking about earlier that they do with the moisture that he beat him. Beat him by decision. Very controversial fight though. Some people think that Marvin should have one. I would say it's probably one of those fights where it was almost 50 slash 50. Most my friends, it was at least amongst a lot of people. I knew a lot of people thought that Marvin had did more damage. It landed the hardest shots with sugar I was dealing with. Just throw a pity pat punches and it wasn't good enough. And Marvin was chasing them down. I don't know, it's a, I'd have to watch it again as an adult who understands fighting better.

Speaker 3:          02:00:56       But, uh, whatever it was, he didn't get destroyed. And that's better than you could say for a lot of people that fought hagler. Hagler was fucking Hagler. That's the haggar that crushed John the beast. Mugabi remember that shit. That's the Marvin Hagler that beat the fuck out of Tommy hearns. I mean, Marvin Hagler was a monster when I was a kid. They had this fucking TV show that they showed were haggard was training for my staff ham show and uh, he was running on the beach in the Cape in the winter. He's running on the sand and Cape Cod screaming war, just running, screaming,

Speaker 6:          02:01:35       Wah, Wah.

Speaker 2:          02:01:38       This who's just sure at shredded. I mean, Marvin Hagler in his prime had one of the best physiques ever for a boxer. And he was in supreme condition and he was known for maybe not being like the slickest most technical boxer, like maybe sugar ray was or Roberto Duran was. But overwhelming discipline and drive and ferocity who will just break dudes down, you know like you did with the Tommy hearns fight, was the purest expression of Marvin agler. Just skimming. These guys are fighting for the fucking middleweight championship of the world. It's a giant fight between two superstars. And what do they do? They just throw caution to the wind and meet in the center of the ring and start throwing bombs. There was no boxing in that fight. That was a war. That was a crazy war. Throw that shit up. Shut up. Marvin hagler versus Tommy hearns. Fuck. Because that was like talking to them. Put this motherfucker. Just a massive risk taking endeavor to step in there. Those two guys, as big as they were in their prime, those dudes were gigantic. Pretty rough disco. I think it was two rounds. I think you knocked him out in a second. Yeah, if at the most. It was the third, but I'm pretty sure it's fuck is wrong with Jamie.

Speaker 3:          02:02:58       Does your own bumps? What were you looking for? Trying to find which version of the fight I was going to pull up. What does it say? What I started, I'm pretty sure he knocked him out in the second round if I remember correctly, but I might be wrong. It might be the third,

Speaker 2:          02:03:14       but either way it was just chaos. Now that I'm thinking about it, thinking it was the third.

Speaker 3:          02:03:21       Tell us that too. I'm trying to look for that before I pull up the video. Do you got a video? Just throw the video on. We'll figure it out when he gets knocked out, but I mean we had talked about Tommy hearns the other day when Tommy hearns knocked out Roberto Duran. That was one of the most spectacular knockouts ever. Look at this. Look at Tommy hearns was awesome. He had a big crazy afro. He had a back that was so wide. It looks like he was a flying squirrel. Like you could jump off a building and sort of safety. I mean, he was so unusually built and he was shredded too. He was a. He was built scary in a different way

Speaker 7:          02:04:01       and then hagler

Speaker 3:          02:04:04       he was the ultimate throwback. I mean, you're talking in the 19 eighties. He was a throwback. We, they thought of him as a throwback in the eighties, like you thought of him the same way, so he was 30 then, which is kinda crazy because this is like the tail end of the Haggar career. I think haggard only fought is like 35 and then he retired after the sugar ray Leonard fight. But this was Hagler, you know, when he to agler this was 30 years old. This is as good as it fucking guts. Five foot nine, 160 pounds and just a fucking dynamo.

Speaker 3:          02:04:45       And you know, the weird thing, one of the weirdest things about Hagler God are they still have watched that dude five. He had natural. I'm like head gear. He had really thick mode. Look at that beautiful right hand. These guys. These guys are winging it at each other. Oh my God, this is crazy. The thing about haggars, he also could take a tremendous punch, like a trim. That exchange. He was very smart, right? Yeah. What was very composed, but he had natural thick muscle all above his ears. Like his temple area was almost protected by like thick muscle. And I don't know what that's from, whether it's like from some biting exercises that he had done because there was a bunch of guys who did have some devices to strengthen your jaw. And Gerry Cooney used one before he fought George Foreman. I remember seeing it. It's like this thing you put in his mouth and it was like a. He would bite down on it and lift weights with it. So he's like pulling a cord and lifting weights with his jaw. Well, I don't know if hackers was just natural just born with it, but whatever it was is you can kind of see it in the shape of his head. You see is right in this hitman's right now. He pops it right at him. He steps to his left arm. Just goes up like a short distance. Fucking amazing. Yeah. Tommy hearns broke his hand somewhere in the, in the round.

Speaker 3:          02:06:11       And those fucking bombs. You strong muscle head. Sure. You going to break something? Look at this. Well, you throw full power bombs and hit somebody in the top of the head. Something's to go. That top of the head doesn't move very much. That's where a lot of guys will break their hands. It's hitting guys on the forehead. This is just a crazy fight. The Marvin Hagler just absorbing it and then he starts putting the pressure on her and so we're like two minutes into the round now and hearns is started to throw weaker and weaker punches and now haggars muscle and I'm up against the corner and just beating them down.

Speaker 3:          02:06:47       That's one of the big things about Hagler was his endurance, his pace and just the will that he had the will to fight a fight like this where you just stand right in front of a guy like Tommy hearns and said, dude, you are not going to knock me out. You can't knock me out. You don't understand. You think you could knock me out, but I'm going to stay right here. Like nobody fought Tommy hearns like that. Everybody will want to stay the fuck away from these punches with hagler could absorb punches like almost like no one else. He got knocked down once and his whole career and it was a bullshit knockdown. The referee called it a knocked down, but if you look at it, it doesn't look like jet. Most people agree that it wasn't a good knock down. I don't remember the fighter he fought to. I think it was one role, Dan, I'm pretty sure, but it was more of like

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       he like Kinda shoved him down. Then knocked him down. You know when you was like Tommy hearns and some other boxes like Roberto Duran or something. You could tell that they were raw talent and walked into a gym and they worked with somebody really good and they learned how to box will. I see Marvin Hagler and I see like the guy you were talking about before, that's 49. I know floyd mayweather mayweather when I watched them box. I think that that's. This is as good as it gets. What I watch, Floyd Mayweather. What? I just watched this fucking animal dude was standing in front of them, but as intelligent as a boxer can because we all know if I throw something that means I'm open. He throw a lot being in front of him, he's like sucking him men. He's doing something to them. Which is, and this is what I see this now as an adult, you don't see this when you're 20 fucking through.

Speaker 1:          02:08:27       You just see stupidity. But this is where I see his smarts. He's fucking smart, man. Well, he's also, and Tommy, he's doing of wisdom is something that, I don't know, I'm not a boxer, but I could see that he's got a plan. He's not like, you know, he's not doing a vandelay standing in front of you. You know, he's, he's very smart. Fucking amazing. When you watch this type of shit, what you learn. He was just such a pleasing boxer to watch the way move to all that Bob and weave in and head movement and you know, Marvin had just that like track you down style too. Like you knew he was coming forward like Marvin Hagler wasn't doing any fancy foot work or you know, doing the Ali shuffle. He was moving towards you, looking to break you. Oh, and those Mugabe's you mentioned. And those other guys.

Speaker 1:          02:09:18       They were fucking killer killers, killers explained boxing in those days. It's Kinda today compare it to. It's no comparison. Look at this on the left and this is where it starts coming on strong. So I think we're in the second round, right? Right. I think he stops him here. I think if I remember the third boom, boom. And they stops him in the third or this is the third. Oh, okay. So this is where he starts hurting them. Damn. But he's got this number right, because he's got his number and he's not even going in like a savage either. Again, very composed. Watch them again before this round is over at each one of those types. It's just cutting up the fucking tree. Well he's not giving them any air either. Boom. Those are the guys that don't give you any breaks. Those guys the scariest because you can never recover.

Speaker 1:          02:10:08       So if a guy like Tommy hearns unloads his best shit on you and then breaks his hand. So he's got one hand. I don't know which one. I believe he hurt his right hand. So he's got a left hand, his right hand is all fucked up and he can't really knock you out with it anymore. He's fucked. So now he's trying to kind of try to hit you with big left hooks and Marvin never let some stop. Never let them take that breath. Always keeps him moving, always keep that pressure on him and he's just wielding

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       where every second of every round he's wilting. And in these exchanges where it takes a break, you hit him with some hard shots and you just keep piling it on. Key. Pilot it on. That was an exciting, exciting era of boxing. You could wear his socks all the way up to your knees, get athletic socks with stripes on them for these pay per view of as I used to go to the metal heads. Yeah. So you would go to the meadowlands race track and that would be inclusive in the price of the fucking track that night. What's the gamble? What's the fight? I forget who I saw Marvin hagler fight. How many times are the haggler flight? Tummy hurts just once. Okay. Tommy hearns didn't want no more of this shit. Who did is fight a couple times sugar ray. That's who I saw at the the boom, the left hook. Boom, the right hand. Boom, left hook, right hand. God Damn had Tommy her to survive this. See now Marvin is pouring it on. Look at this. Jesus Christ. Look at his hands. Joe Rogan did. He hasn't moved this beautiful. Just beautiful, beautiful box and look. Same pace that he had in the first round. I mean mark was just beating down on him. Just putting it on him. God is a great fight. Such a great fight.

Speaker 3:          02:11:43       So yeah, Tommy makes it out of the second round. Wow. See My. That's one of those things, man, in your brain, you have a memory and it's like a false memory and sometimes you have to watch the fight to see it because it's just the case with everything though. There's so many memories that you have from just a few years ago. You wonder like, man, how did that really go down? Let me watch it again. What was that movie really like? Yeah. Let me watch that fight again. The human memory is real weird.

Speaker 3:          02:12:14       That's the saddest things about these boxers too, when they get older and older and more fucked up. As you know, the memories. One of the big ones that goes well, that's one of the. One of the things that I've heard you talk about, like let's say somebody has a fight on a Saturday, they have a close decision. You'll watch it again Sunday when you get home. Then you will watch it for a few days, let the eat to wear off and then watch it again and you'll see the true winner if you know how to count points and the bullshit. You know the problem with picking a true winter though I, I sometimes make subjective decisions in my own head that go back and forth like I'm not always convinced that I'm right like you. If you look at a guy who lands harder shots but less of them, like here's a good example, Dan Henderson versus Michael Bisping. Now Michael Bisping thinks he won and the judges think you want, and a lot of people think he won because he landed more shots, controlled, more moments of the fight. Dan Henderson thinks he won because he hurt Michael Bisping a couple of occasions, beat him up. His face was really battered and in the first round in particular, he came way closer to stopping the fight then

Speaker 3:          02:13:25       than bisping ever did to him. So I could see that argument as well, that those moments where he had incredibly damaged should be worth a lot of points. I see those arguments, man. I don't. I don't know who's right or who's wrong. Quite honestly. I could see both arguments. I see bisping's argument makes a ton of sense to me. He put in more work, he landed more shots. He, he came back from getting really badly hurt, which showed amazing heart and cardio. I see that argument too, so it's like deciding who wins and loses a fight isn't always very clear. There's different philosophies like you talked to a wrestler, he's way more impressive. The guy that takes the guy down a bunch of times. Then a guy who lands some brutal leg kicks in the third round, but if you talk to a Moitai Guy, he'll go, yeah, well what happened in those first two rounds?

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       Yeah, he took me down, but he didn't do anything once. He had me down. So the only thing is he's laying on me. I'm not getting hurt, but in that third round I fucked him up and you listen to what he said and go, wow, that is a good point because that guy's damaged like you damaged his leg. Yeah. There's the Kao Woo. Show that again, so that you're a barrage. Wow. This is 85. Watch this shit. God Damn Man. Yeah, I was in high school, Dude. This is when I was a senior in high school. This was a tough fight. I remember watching this with my jaw just hanging down like wow. Because I thought it was going to be a crazy fight and it was a crazy fight, but I never thought it was going to be this. This was so crazy. And Marvin Hagler just mauled him. I mean, he kind of shut everybody up, man, because there was a lot of people that thought Tommy hearns going to knock them out. It thought that he had never been hit. Oh, so you went a little bit too far back. This is where they checked his cut and uh, well they checked his cut. They were, you know, Tommy hearns and nailed them a couple of times and Hagler is probably worried about them stopping the fight.

Speaker 3:          02:15:20       Was that just God knows what the fuck I was doing. I was in Jersey and hygienists. I'm shit 85. Tommy hearns had such a good job. Just snap it out at you. And what those long arms. He used to keep his hand like below his trunks, you know, like below the waistband of his trunks and just pop it right in your face. Like see how he did it there? Oh Shit, boom. This is it. Boom. That lasts right hand. And then that left. Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:15:51       That was one of the greatest boxing fights in boxing finishes of all time, of all time. Especially. It's hard today to understand what it was like when I was in high school when this was going on because this was a. It was just, there was no internet. Right, so this is, this is just word of mouth and radio, you know, you'd hear about it on the radio, he'd see the newspaper, you'd look in the box. It was, fuck yeah, it was paper view and you didn't see Dick. You had to go somewhere, you got to go somewhere. He had to go somewhere and you had to watch it in a theater. We would pay it would, they would call closed circuit closed. They didn't call it paper view back then you say, oh, well how do we see the fight? Oh, it's closed circuit. So you would go there and you'd pay a ticket and then you go sit in a movie theater, a bunch of other savages and you guys would all watch the boxing match together.

Speaker 3:          02:16:41       That's how I saw sugar ray and Hagler close circuit. I think I saw, like I said, I saw the haggler sugar ray at the track and there was another one that I went. It wasn't more like seats. It was like general admission. Yeah. Yeah. I saw it wasn't like seats. I saw Tyson fight like that standing room only and they put on this big screen. It was outside. They put on a big screen and then they played the commentary to the crowd was crazy. It was like a giant, like almost like a drive in movie theater, but they had speakers and stuff that was in vegas. I fought Frank Bruno and uh, they were fighting in Vegas, but I didn't have the money for the fucking tickets. Tickets. Stupid expensive thousand. Tyson Tyson says prime and Frank Bruno might've been the best built guy to ever box heavyweight ever.

Speaker 3:          02:17:28       You ever see Frank Bruno? Do you remember? Jesus Christ last fight I watched Tyson fight was maybe like when he knocked out spinks. Oh yeah. The city. My friend had a party, you know, the whole fucking first room, the pizza them and get the. I think Bruno was actually before spinks. Maybe I'm wrong, I think I'm wrong. I think I'm wrong. I think spinks was first and Bruna was later, but um, I'm, I, I don't know, but Frank Bruno, so just pull up a picture of him so you could see them, but you know, you can see here from the fight that dude was yoked, but some pictures of Frank Bruno just fucking ridiculous. He's just act like. And he was an argument that a lot of a boxing trainers used to use that you can't be that muscular and uh, being effective heavyweight boxer because he was. So that's where Jones' son, you're racist. Jamie, how dare you. Who is that? Oh, how dare you. It was Roy Jones, but I'm like, that's him now though. See, look how fat Ricky Hatton. God, Holy Shit. Damn Ricky. Um, there's a good picture of two. Dude was just jacked and that's him. Obviously he's not even fighting. There is like, you just see without him even flexing, like not at full muscle flex. He's still super jacked

Speaker 3:          02:18:56       and he'd beat a lot of guys up, but Tyson marked them. But that again, that was when Tyson was Tyson dude says Tyson. Bruno one. I didn't know they fought twice. Oh yeah. I think he stomped him twice.

Speaker 3:          02:19:11       Let me ask you, what year was this? Just said it. 80 nine. How was the testing in those days? There was no gi test. No. That's why these guys showed up. Fuck. Like Ken Norton when I was a kid, Ken Norton was the biggest motherfuck have his own my life. Was he bones at those times or was Kennedy's natural, do you think? They did that in the seventies and it was. There wasn't a lot of options, I think is steroids. I like to check. What were the options? Maybe the Germans, Adam, they definitely had them. The Germans had them. There was definitely. He just looks like an athlete. You make an athlete there. But there was one fight that Ken Norton did look a little yoked. Well, he was a big guy when he fought Muhammad Ali. He broke his jaw. I mean he was a serious athlete and he was a former pro football player, right?

Speaker 3:          02:19:58       Wasn't. He says marine marine toughness. And I believe Ken Norton Played Professional Football, so definitely did Sunday, Sunday. Is that what it is? I didn't. I just know that it's Sunday. That must be what I'm thinking of. But Ken Norton was a bad motherfucker. Dude. He actually got, he's pretty badly banged up now, but not from boxing. He got in a car accident and apparently got really hurt. And that car accident, did you see this over the weekend? That happened in a box? I did one mile one. Well Lopez, he take his code, we're afraid of Alaska is junior. And then when after his trainer punches trainer in the face. So that dude went down and then he goes up to the guys trainer and I don't know what the fuck the trainer said, but he goes right out to them. Do. They're throwing bombs at each other. Hilarious. And that he's pointing at him. Why are you pointing at him? He started it. Is that what you're saying? God. Craziness. People are nuts. But that's a nutty sport, you know, like what we were talking about earlier. Would that, uh, hold floyd floyd mayweather thing like that kind of sport. You're going to have things like that. You're gonna have people that want to have 30 minute fights in the gym, like 30 minute rounds.

Speaker 3:          02:21:15       It's pretty, it's ridiculous. But it makes sense when you think of this sport, you know, what the sport really kind of represents. It's like the extreme nature of those guys who compete in it. It's just, it's crazy that the athletic commission got pissed at people throwing water bottles but didn't get pissed at him for doing that. It's, you know, I get it. I get it. If you're floyd mayweather, I get it. I mean, that's how you, that's how you become that guy in the first place. You get brought up fate or there's talk of him fighting Matt [inaudible] supposedly according to, um, um, someone that I know that is not true. How about that? Alright, well that's, but they might be. Who knows, people might be trolling. That might be a good fight though. Fate and Mitzrian fate. Orin car. When I liked better in rising in Japan. Jody, Jodie, jody. I'm. Tell me about Chicago last time I saw fucking the Fado. I love them to death, you know, I caught the tail end, the fatal. I quite like the two fights before

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       he got on board. Right by a boy part first. And you saw the fights that he won before that? Yeah, like two fights and then a beat Brett Rogers. And then um, I think the next fight after Brett riders. Pretty sure it was fair to him. I didn't catch a fade or in his hay days when I'm trying to say, so the last couple of times I went, it was like how people said they wanted, they went to the checks at the end and they got all excited and went down and it was so that. And then he got submitted by a for Doom Vodoun which you and I discussed it. This could fucking be doing them for him. And he's got a nasty a guard. There's another guy we were talking about yet. Nasty guard. Yeah. So then I saw a couple of pieces of the last fight that was fucking embarrassing. That was fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:23:15       Both of them. Fabio, I love, I love his fucking jaw and he takes a fight at short notice and then he fought that Indian gentlemen before that. Yeah. So, but Fado, I mean now you just want to exploit the guy and that's how people get hurt. I don't drink freight. All wants to fight the people that he for fucking years and he was killing people and all of a sudden he didn't fight for a while. Now he wants to make a comeback. I don't know. His brother got out of jail. His brother just got out of jail. Is that true? Yeah. Okay. I did read that. Ready to fight. I'm doing pushups and working out in jail. He's going to come out jacked new tattoos. I like. He just wants to fight. I want them to be able to fight just like I wanted them to be able to fight when he was 20.

Speaker 2:          02:23:55       I want to deal with the fight when he's 40, if he wants to. Why not mean he knows that it's not good for you? He knows that the damage that a fighter can take. He's been beat up. He's been stopped. Dan Henderson knocked them out, bigfoot, knocked him out for doom, submitted by a triangle. I mean he's had some goddamn wars and some solid is fault. Not only was he saw it as fuck, he was solid as fuck in a division where people are very rarely solid as fuck. Like heavyweight is traditionally like a division, at least in the UFC where the title changes real quick. It's just, it's too hard to maintain for whatever reason or you know, up until now it's been but fate or he didn't. I don't think he lost it anybody for more than 10 years and years and he fought very good fighters over there.

Speaker 2:          02:24:41       He fought very good fighters. I mean he fought cro, cop, Cro, cop, Cro, cop. You know when cro cop was streaking and he, he essentially out kickbox Cro, cop, you know what I mean? That's what he did in that pride fight. There was a lot of striking involved in that fight and a fade or one he won that fight like pretty clearly. And again that was when cro cop was in his prime and cro. Cop had plenty of chances to stand with them and he couldn't. He couldn't get the deal closed. So there was that fight. That was a big fight. Submitting Mark Coleman when Mark Coleman was a fucking beast. That was a big. That was a big deal. There's a few fights that were really big deals, but then there was a fight that didn't happen. Here's the biggest one though. Minataro the Minataro fight.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       When Tara was in his prime and fate or beat him down, that is probably is most impressive because minotauro back then was fucking scary. He was really good. I mean the minute that triangled Mark Coleman Minute Toro, that was just anybody, he got a hold of your neck like you were getting choked out, you know, he was, he was bringing Jujitsu at a super high level to the heavyweight division. And the thing about minotauro was he could take a shot. He could take a shot, especially in his prime, like nobody. He was like, he was like, I'm vulnerable. I go, he didn't feel pain. You'd crack him. He would take shots. Then he'd finished you, you know, a cro cop beat the shit out of Minotauro for one round. I mean beat the shit out of him and then he had kicked them at the end of the first round, like boom and minute. Tarell thought they stopped the fight, but it was actually the end of the round. He thought they stopped the fight with the referee. So that was like, no, no, like you're not going to stop this. And the guy goes, no, no, no. Just the end of the eyes like, okay, good segue around. Starts shoots in, takes Cro, cop down, armbars him.

Speaker 2:          02:26:32       He was just so tough. Fade or beat him down, man. Fatal heart. Beat him down and it was a scary beat down. Like he had been a when the corner and he was ground and pounding them with these for Roche's. Those casting punches that fade orthros. He's not punching like this, like straight. He's throwing these crazy like circular hammers that are going around your gloves, like you're holding your gloves up in front of yourself, trying to defend yourself and he's thrown these whipping punches that are going behind the gloves and smashing Minataro his face. I was. It was one of the worst beat downs you ever saw. A ground and pound and pride like trapped in a corner because he just. He just worked a man. He didn't put some ferocious punches then. Not a lot of people would have been able to take. He broke his cheekbone.

Speaker 2:          02:27:22       He hit him with some bombs, man, but that was when Fado was fader. So if you look at that fight with Minataro, you look at that fight with cro cop like some of his best performances. There's no doubt he's, if he's not the greatest, it's between him and Cain Velasquez, in my opinion, as far as the two greatest heavyweights of all time. And then honorable consideration to fabrizio verdon like fabrice overdoing. Despite getting killed with one punch by steep meo chick still submitted. Cain Velasquez submitted Minataro and submitted fader. He submitted three all time greats. So those are the three that I think you have to take into consideration is the greatest of all time. The only thing that you would look and you'd say, well more people. Uh, like how many people beat each guy, you know, how many people beat Minotauro versus how many people beat fade or versus how many people became.

Speaker 2:          02:28:13       And Kenny count all that up. Who knows? It's, you know, it's hard. It doesn't really make sense. Like trying to figure out who's the greatest of all time, who gives a fuck. But if it is a moral new guy comes along and we've been waiting some time for 20 minutes. The thing about fate or those that he did it for so long. No, he did it for the longest time when I, I tapped into them, like I said, towards the end and when he lost, he got the arm bar from reduce was like, I wasn't surprised, like you could see the deterioration they were trying to explore them at that time with the UFC that were asking for money. They know what they want to do with them. It was like they knew something. You're following me. It's like when that team calls you up, when they try to give you the home run fucking champion or the last eight years miraculously on a Tuesday, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          02:29:05       Like why do I deserve this fucking call? They knew something and he started losing a couple of fights and they retired shortly after. Well, he lost three in a row. It's really crazy. Which was crazy. And the first one he loses by submission, you know, but it was a mistake. He followed her doomed to the ground. He hit him, he had him hurt. He thought he had him hurt him, just set a trap, locked them up tight, gotten with that nasty yard. But the second one was bad. Second one, he fought big foot and that was one big foot was big foot. That's been big for us on that testosterone to they, that's when they allowed them to do it because you know, bigfoot had a pituitary gland tumor, so he had like legitimate gigantism and he's a guy who actually needed testosterone. He really did need it and it was, and a door, it was just boom, boom, boom.

Speaker 2:          02:29:56       He stopped them and you know, people forget that big foot despite the fact that he's an enormous guy or I'm not just despite rather, but uh, as well as being an enormous guy, he's also a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. Like legit. That guy mounts you, you're fucked. It's a 300 pound giant person mounted you with black belt skills and he's dropping these fucking laptops on your head. Boom, boom. Yeah, fuck that. So that was a bad beating. And then Henderson Kod and the Henderson one was Henderson's and 185 pounds, which is even crazier. So he went from a 300 pound man, k, l and M to 185 pound man k on them. And by the way, Henderson not a big one. 80 five like Henderson's. Not as big as some guys that have fought and one 70. That's how hard he fucking punches and listens. Tiny. I wouldn't say that to his face. I thought he was tiny, tiny, tiny. But he listen man, you know, you watch pro football, right? You look at those defensive backs and also you see him after the game and you're like back, I hate that fucking big way. He's hitting, he's lightened people up. But he's five, nine, one 85. The momentum's. Wait, you're right. That's a perfect size for all that sharp dig is Otros Cinco. Check it out. You. Yeah. You were just saying I'll look them up as a fisherman. I guess

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       six. One, one 85. That seems like to be at your fastest. Seems like that's a good weight for those guys, right? Pulling 95, two, two. Oh, five one. 80 five. You know, if you're a good defensive back, you're one 85, you're banging up against my. So what do you think? Like the lightest guy that plays in the nfl ways. What's a super light guy? One slash 75 with a DB. Wow. Let's check it. I, I gotta listen to this fucking there's fucking receive is that'll pick you up and throw you out of the stadium. They got Thai. Then instead of fucking six, 60 to 65 and they got, you know, what's the, what's the shit they say to people like, you know, when they break up the 1:55, look at this guy. Oh my God, what's the top at one? 19. What's that? That backup a little their backup so we could see better. It was from another story or didn't have the whole thing. Oh I see, I see. Huh. But he's a receiver.

Speaker 3:          02:32:24       So one guy said he was one guy weighed 155 pounds. Was that recent or is that back in the day? It was a current player. That guy. But let me tell you something about that 1:55. That 1:55 is running fucking right. Passion. Probably I could bet my life that they let him play at 1:55. It's because either he's going to come in one, play a game and just do a for fucking four for three. Yeah, there you go. I don't have to tell you. It's all the same shit. That guy has to come in, but if he gets hit he ain't get mad. Don't get caught from behind. If anything they like grabbed his leg. The guy's gonna die like Pete rose. Grab his leg there. You ain't going to hit him. It's just him doing drills. Jamie, you know, what is he doing? I want to say it.

Speaker 3:          02:33:18       Let's say a guy running for president. Unless you're there, I think there's something lost in a video of a guy running. You know, what is it like you ever see a guy like work out live and super impressed, but you see it in a video and you're like, oh, not that big a deal. It's hard to move the ball back. Yeah, that's what they do. And that's what I told you. God for that Holy Shit. Like lightning 56 is pretty fast from. So Holy Shit. Wow. Well, hey, that's being 160 pounds. Why he got them? Watch this one. Nope. No, this guy, they said one 65. So what they said Jamie is a different guy. Oh look at that. I think I've tried to hit them. They've tried to grab his leg. Oh my God, he's so fast. That's hilarious. Holy Shit. He's like a ghost like to dive in in front of them. Look at this,

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       look at this shit. Oh my God. Best running back in college football right now. It's about his size. He was a little bit bigger than 1:55, but he's five slash seven, like one slash 75 and he's got no, he can't be stopped or stopped because they can't see him. What happened to that white dude right there. Back that up just a couple seconds ago. I mean, obviously I'm not a fucking commentary a little bit for before that. Before that. Watch this guy. Watch this white dude that's waiting down there. Watch this. Don't do anything. He's the punter. He is. He can't take them out if you're the punter. He's about. Hold on.

Speaker 1:          02:34:53       Some part is don't give a fuck Jack. They had a couple of cocktails before the game. They'll throw that shoulder in the but that's all you're going to get out of them as a good shoulder.

Speaker 4:          02:35:01       That guy just stood there, so show that again. That guy just stood there in front of them and like fake them out. Watch like he's running. I was trying to steer him out of bounds, but he can. He can't tackle. He doesn't practice to. Can't tackle him. He allowed like prop them up. Well, I don't have pads on. Don't hit me. Does the punter where the same pads? Not usually because they have to kick their leg up higher and they stuff on Dev. A smaller helmet to less protection. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:35:31       You really can't. Weird. You can't kick. You can't touch the pump. It's a violation. So he's not going to be padded up until the gazelles. Right? I get it, but he could still trip this motherfuck. I mean you get candies allowed to get in 300 g's a year. You got to do something. Do something. Just kicked the ball into his hand. He ran it back. If he runs back to you, you fucked up. You fucked up. You fucked up somewhere. You put it in this range. Trip him. He see the punter. What you want to do is. Let's go to the fucking video tape here. This is the scoreboard right here, right? Joe Rogan, and this is the field. If I'm a punk them my job is. You see what that 60 yard line is?

Speaker 4:          02:36:06       Watches the punter punting, hundred and 50 pounds. That's the part that I just check that dude. Ninety nine. Why that? I think I get mad at them. Elbow of them are. They're excited. They're happy. Like you funny. Like it was my daughters would think is an aggressive, you know, like don't fucking hit me with guys after they're playing football. That's a good thing. Booms. He watched this other guy runs into them. You Washes? Yeah. Motherfucker like he's excited. He likes double poms. I'm on his chest, but that's it because he likes him.

Speaker 1:          02:36:40       So Joe Rogan, he wants to have the boy here right when I'm paying you. I don't want to. Borderlands in here. Yeah. He's going to get momentum from here. Right? I want the borderlands always on the six yard line right here. This is why I want the ball on the end territory. Right? Because I got more support. I could get them from the inside. This motherfucker kicked it here. He's fucking doing a fight. He's five foot 880 pound weight thing is going to do. Right, so you kick a ball, throw a guy right there, you put it right there for him. He should be shot on. You should at least recovering tackle them or buy them or do something. Yeah, already fucked up with the punter

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       already. He fucked up. You want to put that ball where he's going to have the most out. Let me ask you this. When you're talking about baseball and all the pete rose stuff, you can run into dudes anymore and you know you're seeing like the softening of society. How are they going to soften up football they have. You can't be an and no more like can you go on to still pretty fucking brutal, right? The raiders, you remember because at this time you were a kid and people talked about the raiders. Had a reputation is bad motherfuckers. I mean one of their guys crippled the dude on Monday night football. Jack Tatum fucking crippled the guy with a hit home at first. You know, until the spine. That's. Did he do it on purpose? I don't think so, but that's the reputation you have is that reputation has grown, you know, with all the Mattoon, Zach's and all those crazy motherfuckers hit themselves in the head with helmets and Oh shit. Does it sell tickets itself? Tickets. I mean now with all the show, often, I don't know. It takes away. I don't need to see a guy on his back, bro with his parents and home on their feet watching this on tv thing and his body shaking because he just jolted his neck. I think that shit too. Well, I have a friend who went to a high school game recently and he said, I think he said five, five kids got laid out in a high school game.

Speaker 2:          02:38:44       He said they just cracked into each other and you know, seeing as kids lying on the ground with their Bell Rung City saw it five different times. He might have said six man, I'm, I'm trying to remember, but he was shocked. Oh my God, those two guys. Oh my God. They double smash into this dude, look at this. He gets the ball. Boom, boom. Oh, that guy's going home for a couple of weeks. It went back like that. That's horrible.

Speaker 4:          02:39:11       Is that him? No, it's another guy. It's like the top 10. Oh, highlight thing. I was just putting it up. I as you're talking. I thought they're showing them smiling afterwards like we're okay. Everything's fine. You fucking on that play. Yeah. You imagine your home. It goes back that are looking at these potential. Is that a fine? Is that a violation? Jamie's going to be a. because he led with his elbow. He knocked him out. Oh Shit. On the replay here. He's the guy that dove into them because when the quarterback slides like that, joe that aren't allowed to hit them at all, they're giving up their body, so not allowed to be touched. Basically. Out All you gotta let them just hit the ground and he was already flying in and hit him with the elbow, which also hit him in the head. Say Probably. He probably got fined 25, 30,000 bucks for this.

Speaker 2:          02:39:52       Wait a minute, hold on. Do that again. Let me say this again.

Speaker 4:          02:39:56       The car, he's, since he's sliding feet first you got, you don't even touch them. You're supposed to just let up, but he's. He's already in a position where you can't stop to it. Too Bad. You got to have better control you. That's what they say. You just kind of better control. But what do you think? I'm looking at this and it didn't look intentional to me. I mean elite. You could definitely argue that it's not intentional. I mean it seems like the guy is sliding and he's on top of him already. He's got to kind of roll with it. Do you think he knew that he was hitting him in the face now? One, we were just literally just talking about that specific one here. You can see him throughout his elbow, so it looks like he's doing a little bit extra with the elbow, but then they also, they'll get into arbitration things like they also do with some of the MMA thing. They'll have a lawyers argue some of this stuff out. So what happened with that Tom Brady situation at drug out for two years and they finally just took us four game suspension. See, I don't know man. It's hard to say.

Speaker 1:          02:40:48       Now. The problem we're having is Joe Rogan is said, okay, I go back and I look at my high school. I looked at the kids I grew up in those four years. I knew how they practiced. I knew how they worked out and I knew how they hit each other. Okay. And then some of them went on to college and did what the fuck they had to do. Are they any of them fucked up today? Oh yeah. What a troll. That dude head to head Kale. That guy. What? You know why five kids went on to your friend's high school, man. You know why? Why? Because Oh, Jesus. Now were bread and butter in them. And then show that one again and then not used to get mad. No more were bread and butter. What do you mean? We'll put down to that. So he was at practice with just going like this now, which is going like this. It's like when you and I go to a karate competition and it's a

Speaker 4:          02:41:40       Oh, oh, oh my God, this is horrible. This one's horrible. Boom, look like his body goes backwards. He's unconscious. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          02:41:55       Boom. Has had. Oh, when the helmet goes off, you know you're fucked. That's visions. That's Japanese people yelling at the night. That's what you hear in the middle man out cold. You need to be a parent watching this on TV at any level. No. He's snoring out cold. That is. Look at this. Could do all my

Speaker 4:          02:42:19       God. He took it to the temple sideways. Head to head. Now, that kind of shit. Is that on purpose? That's ahead. That's flipped out. He went, yeah, that was the shoulder. That's. That's kind of what you're taught. That's what you're taught to do. So just part of the consequences of ball. Big giant guys running around his shoulders. It hit him.

Speaker 1:          02:42:37       So I thought it was heading to work at his waist. Joe Romm back. Look how everything twisted. It's not just a head contact, it's that spine contact. That's what makes altogether. You just see a fucking bolt. The lightening and Shit, look at that spine. Can his whole thing twisted? That's why he put his arms up. Is that the guy that got knocked out that was sitting there with the dreadlocks?

Speaker 4:          02:42:57       No, they were shitty editing this video. They fucked with me twice. I was going to show you next. This is what the. The alternative to this is right now is there's some tackle non tackle nonpaid leagues and so there's seven on seven us. There's less guys running. I don't

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       know that anybody wants to pay to watch this though. This is the problem. Well, the idea is to be that haven't pads was good for you and have it helmets is good for you, but now they're thinking that it's not in that you're going to do things like that where you wouldn't do those kinds of things. Going back to your fucking brain argument brain, if the brain doubled in 2 million years or whatever, the fucking thing. Our strength also doubled. The things that we're able to do with our bodies also doubled. Okay, and even though you're a welcomed addition, football pain, you're prepared for him. It's like this. You're not prepared for me if I'm fucking dead lifting 70 slash 50 and I'm doing certain exercises to make my hits even better because there's some guy like the guys we talk about like the trainers is.

Speaker 1:          02:44:02       We talk about the working on specific movements like they worked on specific movements or have ema. We were talking about like joy Alvarado works on the, the, the Turkish getup. Well that's people man. When football that I've said, you know what, I've been watching football for 20 years and this is the workout I'm implying and this makes a guy like you at 20 fucking 22 years, the strongest you've ever been. Twenty four years out of college. You're bench pressing 3:50 3:50. Even if you're fucking one 85, you're bench pressing now in highschool 3:25. It's not what it used to be. 80 five, the national average of this. Go ahead and look at the results of these combines 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and what these kids are doing now. Speed wise, strength wise, flexibility wise. So there's a guy that has broken down the kinesiology of a football hit.

Speaker 1:          02:44:53       Okay, and then maybe put it in a workout. I'm hitting you double than what I used to hit you all. Nine hundred and 30 pound squat by a Texas high school junior. This is what I'm talking about. That's a junior in high school. They've improved form. They've improved seven foot 440 pounds. Okay. You know, grow big and okay. Fifty years ago or seven foot guy couldn't walk around. Okay. Now he's playing basketball. He's adjunct for years or seven foot guy. Couldn't put weight on there. That fucking kid. Look at this. The biggest football player we've ever seen. Wow. He's in high school. He's gone. Yeah. That bringing them cars already. Oh yeah. His bitches. That bringing them women in a car trunk prepared already. We guys are going to shoot them and put them in the trunk and say, we'll see. I'm bringing him. Young tech has to be the mountain for Halloween, right? No. Why would you be anything else? I would have fucking armor. Just different different outfits at the mountain. Where's done? Just like the brain has grown. We've gotten stronger. We've gotten way stronger. Our, our workouts were particular things have gotten more on that. Was that

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       what you want pinpoint for what you're doing or what exercise will they understand what's beneficial and what's so? They also understand when you're recovering epogen and guess what? In 20 years we're going to be hitting even auto. You're going to see jaws flying right off the fucking face. Some MMA fight. You're going to see a George just snap open to the whole of the side of some of these that somebody is going to be hitting that much fucking harder. You know, 30 years ago, look at this, you know, they were hitting in the seventies, but. Well, it's interesting to me is when you start talking about the brain getting bigger and bodies faster, kill him. That dude was a killer. There was accounting straight up. What's interesting to me about these athletes getting better and faster and stronger and brain's getting bigger. It's a wonder what it's going to be like.

Speaker 2:          02:46:58       You know, they talk about the human brain doubled over 2 million years. Why would we assume that that stopped? You know, maybe it's just a long, long, long process of brain getting bigger, people getting bigger, people getting strong or people getting faster. Like what's the performance of a person that don't look like if it's increased that much. It's the 19 sixties. Have we reached like this? A bottleneck, like a physical bottleneck and we'll be able to fix that with like genetic engineering will know that. No. Now we're just going to. Now we're pointing. I'm being even stronger and faster though. Yeah, I know, but just like this is where you saw to that that whole side thing gets real interesting. You know, and they're, they're doing a noble pursuit, right? They try to clean up the game, stop all the cheaters, people getting pop left and right.

Speaker 2:          02:47:41       I go on the underground, the underground new section that mixed martial arts.com and like every couple of days some new persons flagged you find out this guy got flagged that kind of got flagged. So they're catching people for sure, but what are they going to do? What are they going to do when, when science starts stepping in and improving people. You know, I mean it seems to me like it's pretty fucking inevitable. I mean right now in mixed martial arts, let's just take the USC for example. If I was a manager, I'd tell my client, listen, I don't give a fuck what you're thinking. Please don't embarrass me. Don't you have a fighter's? Don't want to be honest about that kind of shit. I know. But you know what? As a man to man, you might be on this time. Yeah. I don't want them motherfuckers with them.

Speaker 2:          02:48:28       Yeah, I think I catch you at the time when you don't need it. You know, it's interesting. Apparently they don't know how to spot human growth hormone very well. It's speculative whether or not they could catch people doing that and it might be one of the reasons why they're holding pis and blood for so long. They hold your sample for like nine years. They freeze it. So as the tests get better and better and better, they pull things back and then the, you know, if you're still competing, if I can find you and suspend you five, six years from now, that is the fucking Kinky Shit. You're gonna hold my pis for nine fucking years. What type of Freaky motherfucker you pop in there? Well they already got rid of two Olympic gold

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       medalists from Russia to wrestlers in 2008. They both are pissed positive for something where they tested negative. Then they held onto their sample and now the screening has gotten much better and they just caught them. They removed their gold medal to Olympic medalists. Gold medalists have no fun, no studs to you look at them. You're like, how's that guy on steroids? She just assumed these Russians, man, they have a different thing going on over there that's state sponsored. No one's trying to cover that up. Felt like they, they just, they just, that's what they do. Like that's one of the reasons why they came back close to getting kicked out of the Olympics in Rio. Like they were talking about kicking the entire Russian team out of the Olympics as like, you fucking people have state sponsored doping and I think their eyes, it's like everybody's doing it. Fuck it. Let's just do it the right way.

Speaker 3:          02:50:02       So they just grow you into a certain age. You get to a certain age, your body, but not. Let's say you would get to a certain age and you're a wrestler at a certain days. They just make you go somewhere. It's like Cuba. I think there's probably no, no, there's a lot going on there. And you go somewhere and the doctors checked you out and they give you shots. They tell you their vitamins don't tell you everything that you fucking, uh, which this guy is another one. This is one of them. Two wrestlers. Oh, this guy got stripped of a bronze medal. Another guy gets tripped the, if it's state run, they level with you and it's Russian. They've only been level with you. Which uh, which date, what date is this? When did this article come out? Jamie? Is it a reason? Anyway, point is 2012. Yeah. There's two guys that they just did it too from the 2008 Olympics and there, I'm pretty sure they were both gold medalists, but uh, you know, it's like we were talking about with Usada earlier. So it's, it's a weird business man. Weird business. Pino fighting's a weird business. That's why, you know, you look at that Floyd Mayweather, Jim fight thing you like and no one another sport would they make you have like a basketball game to the death, like no time moments, no score in points. He just, just rack it up. Just keep going. Just keep going. And know there's periods like everybody plays by the rules, not boxing,

Speaker 3:          02:51:33       like it's a compelling thing to have a 30 minute round. You could die doing that kind of shit. Like that is how people that, how that shit gets exposed for real. He's illegal magnet. They tested comedians. Oh my God. Drug tested comedians. Like certain chains, like the Improv or the punchlines like chains at La. Five clubs said, listen, we've got a drug test you a week before you come into our club to make sure that, you know, can you imagine that ridiculous for that we got the entity level. So like this. I'm not even worried about me,

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       I'm just saying, you know, just the general. I'm worried about you really. You're not worried about me. Fuck though. If they started testing for drugs, I'm not worried about you. I'm terrified for you. Just smoke reefer. That's it. Yeah. But that's a drug. What are you going to do? It was like ups would if like a God. Honestly, you know, what could have happened. Okay. You know what could have happened. They, all they would have to do is say something like, uh, like maybe someone was really high and they were on stage and they said something really ridiculous and the club got sued and so they'd say we now have a no marijuana policy because the guy was on that fucking devil's cabbage. And he said some ridiculous shit and our club got sued. That's all it would take. I felt like one big chain, like maybe Yuck Yuck or the Improv or something like that. They just decided, uh, we do not care what you do in your own time, but we require when you work for us that you have a marijuana metabolite level of less than whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 2:          02:53:09       So all right. They would test you when you got the town or the jet after tests you beforehand. So we just show up at your house. Like you saw it a week before you got the Gig. They show up at your house, like you saw them and then once you get there they're going to test you again. Or do I have the whole weekend to get one test you again at the end of the week to just turn their laws? Those tests are expensive. Are they the other pot ones? Like from quest diagnostics. That's like a thousand bucks I think. Which one is the one over the counter at all? You go to quest diagnostics. Different. That's the, that's what I'm thousand users. Right? Protest this guessing you're going to cost me two grand just to come into my fucking clubs to make sure the Improv doesn't get sued. Sir. And you've said, you've said you've said some very defamatory things in the past about Mother Teresa. What'd you think about a year and Piss test? 100,000 dollars a costs your company and it's a very controversial man. Joey Diaz and the business that we're in here at the Improv is providing with families, families with laughter. Okay. Some of the things that you've said, you know, quite honestly I, I believe in freedom of speech, but I find it offensive. No. Okay. So now we got nowhere to run, but to go to the rock clubs

Speaker 2:          02:54:29       and do comedy. Well, when you go to the rock club then it's cool because you're, you're, you're in Japan. That's like, stand up to fight the Japan. Fuck it. I'll fight Japan. Fuck you motherfuckers. Hey you coming in on this. I'm a election night thing that Stan hope and I are doing. I don't know. You said some day. It's like a live part. We're just gonna hang out. Where in the main room in the main room we're gonna do is we're going to look at the results. We're going to have like a laptop or something, streams or results, and we're gonna. Just talk some shit while the elections going on. Most likely

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       it will have nothing to do with the fucking election dog. Yes, please. You know I'm a criminal. Yes. And happened. No, I can't vote, but that Hillary is a criminal. Well, they did reopen the investigation into her. Even that stuff. She's been a criminal for fucking 20 years. Trump ain't no better or in a bad position. Again, I got no dog in this fight. This is from an FEC. Who Do you refer out of those two?

Speaker 1:          02:55:34       I really wanted Bernie Sanders to come back. I don't know. I don't know. Bernie was the best choice, but if we could keep them around for three years shooting fucking good president, like something pops up. You know what I'm saying? Like we shoot Bernie Sanders. If they shot Bernie Sanders, he would be. I've just heard a. I read some New York Times thing about a week ago about arms that are Clinton foundation soul. Well, it's not, it's not that direct. It's a very complicated. As people who were donors to the Clinton Foundation received deals. This didn't. My men Ollie North get in trouble for shit like this. Know Ollie north got in trouble for. They were. That was when the sandinistas were fighting the contract. They were shipping arms illegally to those people. They're providing arms. These emails about arms, right? I don't know what the emails are king, but uh, there's a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          02:56:26       30,000 emails that got deleted after a subpoena. And you know, the crazy thing is people talk. One of the weird thing that's going on with this election is that everybody loves that. A woman, like they're looking at the bright side of things, right? Trying to look at the bright side. It'd be live with fucking fat and it's not going to be the whole little fucking fat chicks would get tos and bare feet. That wedge bag is 180. All right. She's going straight to the clutches of Hell. You understand me? Straight to the clutches of how crooked husband the night she gets into the White House, the lights will all turn red. Oh my God. You'll hear like say tannic music playing and trump ain't no better. But you also got to remember one thing about this fucking moron. Okay. Because I've been thinking about it from an objective point of view.

Speaker 1:          02:57:12       I'm no fucking Phi Beta kappa. He's not a politician Bro. He was never really a politician. I may not even be encouraged to do something like this. So the shit he's talking about grabbing people's policies. The thing that pissed me off the most about that shit, you know, many times I've seen a woman with a big fucking 60 pound monkey me when I'm outside and I just said to myself, I would grab that motherfucker right now, but when I was a sophomore in high school, I had this Italian girl in my class that will clogs. She was a little on the heavy side, but she was beautiful. This girl could stop a fucking clock. She was so beautiful, but her little monkey weighed like 70 pounds and she was a sophomore and she sat behind me and I just went to school with just the look at her monkey. I didn't give a fuck about the rest of the day. I didn't even. I haven't even seen the vagina at this time, but through her fucking pants. You had to see this fucking monster. Why she walked past you with it? Here we go home. Me and my buddies. Decorations and senses. When you're close to him. My buddy stinky would collaborate. Did you see a? Yeah. Yeah, I saw it. Right. That means when a pussy look like, like right to the jeans. It was just a mountain. It was just a fucking mountain. Wow. And I remember her walking by me going, what would it take for me to have the balls to just grab it and just hold onto that savage for a minute because it was beautiful. But the difference. How old were you? 13. 11. He was 60.

Speaker 1:          02:58:47       Oh, okay. I get it. Oh my God. You know

Speaker 2:          02:59:00       billy bar was on. I was actually on his podcast the other day and we were talking about it and you know, we're, we're saying we've heard worse, we've heard worse from friends that are trying to make each other laugh and you're saying, shit, that's not true. And I said Joey Diaz would say something way worse than that. And will he be crying? Oh my God. Doesn't mean that you're out actually grabbing girls pussies. But you would say them, I'll, I'll fuck her feet looked like mine will fucking stab a. like you would say something like, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:59:29       you know. Yeah. That was someone I told Sam that Sam trip, the other guy. Steve Simone. You see that girl? How old are you? 40 eight. I'm 53. You're never going to see that. Very good. Have you ever seen like a nice looking couple now? Like he's 26. She's 22 and that both beautiful. She got perky little pits. She's banging. I was so legs are Sunday. You think that the use of this little young savage must be going home? Tara, that pussy that, when you think back to your little 26 year old in the afternoons, you can take them home and rub him down and give them a good stab. You come like three times the whole fucking thing. That never happens. No more. Like at this age, you look at that and go, I don't know if that happened. You would think of that.

Speaker 7:          03:00:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:00:15       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. They all these guys like, look at that young girl. Look, I'm gonna. Go look at it, look at it. That'll never happen again in my world. However, I will never see a woman naked like that ever again.

Speaker 2:          03:00:28       Let me tell you a story about my friend Jay. My friend Jay has a, a friend who's a Texas oil millionaire. Like he bought a ranch. He bought a, a hunting ranch, like to go hunt deer on it. That's all he does guys. Sixty two guys. Never had a kid. Okay. And uh, I think he's been married and divorced. Maybe never married. Might be never married, never had a kid, doesn't give a fuck. Like literally doesn't give a fuck. And he, every couple, you

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       know, however long it takes, he's got some new 24 year old perfect girlfriend and he just buys them a bunch of Shit, take some places. And then eventually like, I can't do this anymore. He's like, well, you all take care. And he just goes and gets him another one. And he's like, I want you to come meet the new one. But this guy is the quintessential crazy Texas oil man. So this guy goes to Africa and uh, and he goes, what'd you do over in Africa? Goes on, Shit. We went hunting. He go, well, what'd you shoot? He goes, Noah's Ark, two of everything. So it just shows up. He stayed over in Africa for a month just shooting things with this 24 year old girl. He was banging Jose Sixty two. He had um, he had a bunch of different bypasses too. He's had more than one by heart bypass.

Speaker 3:          03:01:54       Like he's fucked. Like he's, he ain't got much time left in. This guy is just poverty and own woo. I think if I saw a push a younger than 30, I would have a bypass. Right? Right there. My heart would split open. I don't want to see it. I don't like. I don't. I'm done. I'm bored. Where would you have the energy to keep up with that? No. Twenty two year olds that want to fuck like rabbits. You don't have mortgages, you know? I mean I have to do is be awake when you show up for work, so that's your responsibility when be 22, unless you fucked up horribly and gotten yourself into some, some real serious position of responsibility. But most of us are 22. No, barely show up for work. If you've got fired and trying to get another job anyway, you're already thinking about quitting. So when you're home, when you're home with some girls also 22, you got just too bizarre. Just chewing up a piece of wood.

Speaker 3:          03:02:45       It's chaos. Just chopping through your own young. Just trying to get rid of come. It's crazy. I would never happen again. Well it might, but it's not gonna happen in this life. No. It might happen all over again. I don't. Like I said, I don't even want to see a vagina if it's under 40 anymore. We've given me a heart attack. I don't meet that my life. You don't have been thinking about a lot lately. Why so many cultures? Think about reincarnation. Why so many cultures believe you do this over and over and over again. Why so many people think you come back so you know the, the, the idea that we live and we die. That's what. That's what like someone who's an atheist, once you believe you're born and you die and they might be right. I don't know who's right or who's wrong, but it is kind of fucking weird that so many different cultures have this idea that you live again. What have you just keep doing this? Would that freak you out? Like I'm enjoying life, right? But why is, why is the prospect of doing this over and over again forever? Like what if you had to live your childhood like your childhood? Joey was a very tumultuous

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       and crazy fucking childhood, but it made you, you. If you knew that you had to start all over again and you're gonna, you're gonna, close your eyes for the last time and you're going to wake up in that hospital room, North Bergen, New Jersey, or in Cuba,

Speaker 1:          03:04:16       and you can do the whole thing again. Same Way, same way. Oh my God. You gotta get it, right. You're dealing it with variations. So come back like as a bird this time, that's what they do. They fuck with you for a couple of times that bring it back as an alligator. You get run over in Florida. Then they bring you back as a bird, like a parakeet when the cat gets you and then you come back as a human. Yeah. And then you start all over again. Then there's times in your life where you think, I've been here before. I've seen this before. Like I've something. And so that's what I feel about reincarnation. I don't know. I don't know. It's. I've been at places and I've gotten. I've been here before, but then again, you have to think about what scientists believe. That life is just an illusion that the patterns that we see are just graded our mind.

Speaker 1:          03:05:05       Who the fuck knows I'm having a good time to refill. Calms me down. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? What else we're doing comedy. What? Healthy. We're having fun. Still fucking ear or picking up the vine like, you know guys have come and fucking gun, you know. Oh yeah. So how lucky am I think I'm going to sit here and think about fucking going to Mars with Elon. I'm not sure. Is that his name? Eland. Eli Musk. That's my dawg dude. We've known each other for almost 20 years. Twenty years. Has It been 20? It might be 20 this giant this January I'll be in La for 20. Which means I met you march of next year. I got. I became, I got, I landed in La January 20th and you know I was a regular at the store. February 19th. Wow. My birthday. That was my only ever claim to fame in this town.

Speaker 1:          03:05:54       I was here. Stan hope referred me. I did seven. She told me come back next week and she made me a regular. It was like written in the movie. I showed up at the comedy store up Monday night at 1130 and 11 slash 25. I think Griffin said, do you mind if I do 10 minutes in front of you and that was my comedy store debut and Shit. Like how much time did he do? He went right to attend to. He would do like three hours. He would do three fucking hours, but still. That was a. that's what kept me here was that stupid fucking comedy store brother. How great is that? That I just walked in there. Stan hope I kept. I'm introduced myself to Scott Day. Stan Ho said to me, it's a six week minimal. Wait, I called in for you. I had three people calling for me I think and he was one of them.

Speaker 1:          03:06:43       They believe Stan hope the most and they called me on a Friday though. I said, you're going up in front of Mitzi Sunday at nine, whatever. I have three minutes ready. And I was like, what the fuck? I thought I had to wait til April. Wow. Like no, there was an opening on the list. Go down there. We've seen a lot of guys come and go. You ever go down the. One of the cool things about the comedy store, one of the coolest things is that the walls are like a museum, like literally like a comedy museum. There is no comedy museum, so for us, the comedy museums of the wall, so places like the punchline, you know, like when you go to an older club, Nashville's Zania Zania national best example pictures that'll make your jaw drop. Yup. Yup. People that aren't even alive anymore and people are not.

Speaker 1:          03:07:29       People that were really big and they just stopped. Tom Models is a one night or out of Iowa, like when you go to rooms and Wyoming cribble runs, which are one nighters that's different than a station. Every comedy club for people at home. That means that a bar with a certain town just does comedy on Tuesday nights every night. I went to a place in Riverton, Wyoming and they had pictures of Roseanne and Tom, Roseanne and Tom Arnold together. When they first started going on the road together, like he had the business for a long time, that's when they're out of Denver, out of Denver, Minneapolis. I thought she was married to somebody else and then they got a divorce and she left and I think she went to Minneapolis for a while. I toured with them and uh, wow. You know, that's one of the sad things about when a comedy club closes down, you lose that museum.

Speaker 1:          03:08:17       Like they used to be. The last stop in river oaks had pictures of Stan hope when he bad long luxurious hair. Remember when Stan hope had like fabio hair stand hope. He used to wear an overcoat and he had long hair and I remember like, I think I had heard that he didn't even have a place to live, just like a car got broken into the finals of the San Francisco comedy competition. Overfilling. And he went and bought like a secondhand suit and he went back there and smoke everybody with the suit on his shit. Yeah. That's where a Dane Cook's manager tried to psych him out before he went on stage. What did he say to them? Something Dickie, you know, something Dickie like, you know, you're never going to beat him or something like that. Like something really shitty stand helpline of winning and crushed it.

Speaker 1:          03:09:11       I saw his son at that time was fucking amazing. Gyro and he's amazing now is set. At that time he had, he had connected the bridge from me. That's what put me on the right path, the bridge of when I watched what he was doing in the half hour that when he was headlining his first half hour, then just the way he was delivering it, his presentation when he was young at the audience when they walked, it was all a fucking thing of genius. It, it hit me so hard that I didn't do comedy for about four days to gather up like what am I going to do with my life? Because if I'm not that good, it's not, we're doing this shit. You know? At that time he was doing the bucket of Vaginas, joke, some way to come up to him and asked him if he wants to buy a bucket of roses and a bar.

Speaker 1:          03:10:03       I don't need roses, I need a bucket of vaginas and then the lady would walk out, but I'll never forget that he said that what? I read the back of the class because she walks out and then some lady in the audience actually gets up and walks out and he's like, lady, I'm sorry I should've said this one online. People would walk and then he'd say things to them as they were walking out, but it was so brilliant. The people couldn't take it no more. I loved what he was doing on stage. He was talking about going to a bar and the g string was stuck in the girl's fucking thing and it was in there somewhere. I'm not doing any justice to this. It didn't matter what he was doing on stage. Nobody was really doing at that time and then he came to La and the way that they were trying to make that fucking squeaky clean, squeaky clean, and he went in and I was in the night when he insulted the burn victim, pick people up there.

Speaker 1:          03:10:58       The Guy, he goes, what the fuck you people depressed? This guy hasn't cracked a smile and now you know, I mean, he didn't stop for awhile. Then he started walking the Improv, you know, like on those nights where all the professionals and the Egos, you know what I'm saying, they would put him on and they would pay and then Mitzi shore made a mistake and she started putting that motherfucker before betsy sokolow. That's not a mistake. It's a mistake. Was she had a method. She enjoyed watching that show. But once you watched it at that time and you know, I'd tell you how it is to show opens up at what time at the comedy store and Saturdays 8:30. In those days she will put Doug Stanhope one third and then he would be, he would hit so hard in the original. They would see who first political guy.

Speaker 1:          03:11:59       Then they will have a buffalo and she didn't really know who stan hope was. She had forgotten and she put them up in the, the fucking nine. You know, the third guy on the list on a Saturday. They were not ready for him. I remember one particular Saturday he was talking about lesbians with a Dick Pumps and a softball game where they all had. I mean he was just going off and the original room didn't even know where he was going, like nobody knew he was going, you're a fucking lesbian softball player. You probably in the fucking thing with a Dick pump, and he even made a cover. He's got an album cover dick. That was that bit. They want to fucking. I'm sitting back there stone to the Gills confused. They were out of it, but the saddest thing, Joe Rogan, honestly, it wasn't the guy that him.

Speaker 1:          03:12:52       It was the two people that follow stand up in those days were in a lurch because the second guy that followed Stan hope was all fucked up. He just put bad energy, general bombs in those days. Hollywood wasn't ready for staying at home and I saw it. I saw that the Security Council approach to stand up, the Hollywood approach, the stand. I was changed like he used to be. You know, there were, there were all boards. They had a letter send down. That's what happened. Well, they were all had 11 sitcoms, you know they will. Yeah, because people will funny. Yeah, we can name a lot of. We could sit here for two fucking hours. We may have a lot of people that came to this town who would genuinely funny and then some fucking suit got to him and said, listen, you have to write your Sitcom for these people and talk about your stage persona.

Speaker 1:          03:13:39       And then they went up there and change that whole stand up and you know what? That's funny in a way, but it's not really who to fuck you up. Right. And that's what happened. People got away from that for a few years are years 96 to 2004 people got away from that. People still want you to build a sitcom on stage, but when that fucking idea went awry, they hadn't. They hadn't let fucking people with a little crazy and it seems like the podcast era. Then people got to understand how much entertainment there is. Just people being themselves, just crazy people. People like you or people like already or people like a Dunkin started. People started recognizing that when you let a guy just be himself or a girl just be themselves, you're going to get the real thing. You're going to find out what's actually funny.

Speaker 1:          03:14:26       Well, it really makes you realize is how much media does control what you watch and see whether it's music. It's comedians. Let's pretend the, but there was no venue for standup like that except for Hbo. Let's pretend that right now, podcasts would not have come up in this. In the last 10 years. You would know me. You wouldn't know Stan Ho. No, you wouldn't know. Stan. Hope you wouldn't know are. You wouldn't know Duncan. You wouldn't know a half a fucking decent comics that are floating around because the people who are controlling comedy, uh, controlling comedy due to certain criterias, youth age, it all has to mix up. It all has to mix up. If it doesn't make up and I'm not crying fucking Wolfie I, I, I'm happy with the fuck I'm doing. I've done great compared to what I thought I was going to fucking do.

Speaker 1:          03:15:10       So I'm talking about, uh, sometimes I'll call somebody and they go, no, you're too old for this thing. Well, you got to think about what people are watching. What can a guy like you to do? You could do one or two things. You can either do an hbo special or you can do nothing. You don't have uncensored radio. Back then they didn't even until series came along and Xm, you didn't even have a venue on the radio, so you had nothing. You had nothing to be you and your stories and all your craziness where you're free like this. And so it wasn't a product to sell. There was no pulse. There's no market. So unless you became a Kennison or a dice clay or someone who got an hbo special or a gut on Rodney Dangerfield, hbo special with the world got introduced to you being dirty,

Speaker 2:          03:15:51       no one was really going to buy it. There was nowhere bitch we got on Joe Rogan's podcast, motherfucker, you're the new fucking run. You also have fucking Comedians to these people. They would never even dreamed about going to watch who. I remember years ago when we went up to fucking cops, the dude, man, I, that shit used to bother me because that was how we were viewed as, well, they didn't, they didn't respect you guys know, but in they thought because you guys didn't have tv credits and because you were dirty that uh, you know, I was making a bad choice by bringing you with me. I'm like, what are you talking about? These guys are hilarious. That stuff is fucking tremendous. Amazing. Fucked up. I didn't bother now, although some people probably St Joe you were quietly. No, I blacked out for a while. I went deep is a lot in that.

Speaker 2:          03:16:35       I took 10 fucking thing. He did a podcast with Sam Harris. Ten 10 sprays. Took two before I got here too. But I think those are kind of worn off and I decided to just see what happens. We know what's good about this. You don't, you don't go deep for eight hours. No. The other shit, I got to commit to it. I liked this little sprayer. I just look for when it. That was a little fucked up. I ain't gonna lie to you. I was seeing doubles. I thought about taking a nap. Well, I think easy in. Easy out, right? Because like it's not digesting in your stomach. It's going through your bloodstream because you're doing it, you know, Trans Dermal. Was that what it is? What is it called when you put it on your. A subdermal right. That was good there for a moment because I hate that fucking bob before I came in.

Speaker 2:          03:17:15       Oh, you did that too. How dare you? Why not? Why? Yeah, why not? I got to dress up like a fucking counseling lingual. Thank you sir. I got to dress up like a cowboy jack. I'm excited. I don't know what my wife's going to be. She's trying to the baby. Don't be an Indian. People get mad at you. Cultural appropriation didn't know what the fuck's her name. Have to apologize. Hilary Duff. Didn't she apologize for Halloween costume? That was cultural appropriation. What was her costume? She was a pilgrim and I think the second lesson. So you can't be an Indian. No more. No more Indians. No more cowboys and Indians. Cowboys versus cowboys. And if you do encounter an Indian, he better be an actual fucking Indian, not some culturally appropriating cis gendered white piece of Shit. Hilary Duff is so sorry about her offensive Halloween costume.

Speaker 2:          03:18:02       Oh my God. So the man you see, people haven't gotten the full message yet from the social justice warriors. They haven't gotten the full message yet. You're not allowed to wear that. Indian social justice warriors fill me in on this. Social Justice warriors are people that want to control the way people behave. They want everyone to be very progressive and very pieces that were page and no now to just a group. And we're going to enforce cultural appropriation. No white guys with dreadlocks. Stop it. Stop. No, you can't have taco Tuesday piece of shit. It's cultural appropriation. They get mad if white guys cooked Chinese food. It's like there's so much going on. I get mad of white guys because I know why the Chinese guy cooking the Chinese for that. That's what's wrong with fucking thing. That's true. You know what else I demand for the most part? I like Mexican food from Mexican

Speaker 1:          03:18:48       people. Um, there's a guy that was getting in trouble for cultural appropriation because he was, he ran a Mexican restaurant, he's a white guy from Oklahoma and it was a huge stinker through and apparently this guy's a huge fan of Mexican cooking and is a real like master chef and goes to Mexico and studied under the great Mexican chefs and opens up Mexican restaurants in America just because he loves Mexican food and they're like, fuck you. You're not Mexican. You can't do it. Culture appropriation, fuck away. We're apologizing for Indian costume before I go right now because I want to turn on three is I'll tell you what's the best show I've seen the sopranos about. Lastly, fucking whatever. You're going to hate it. People going to hate it. It's a show called Selia. Selia celly. It's above Selia cruise. The Cuban singer. How do you spell it?

Speaker 1:          03:19:39       C E L I a what's it on? It's on Netflix. Somebody called me and said, Joe, you tube and no disrespect. You should watch that show. I W I knew Selia crews, like my mom had the bar in the early seventies. My mom was tired, that was Selia, but I was going to Catholic school so whenever she came by I wasn't there. I would see her at the bar and I had seen her a few times but I didn't know much of what I like, like three songs and Cuba. She's like a folk lore like this fucking like be people in Cuba. What is she like a waste? I watched this fucking show and I'm up to episode 30. Okay. And they taped it like a Spanish novella. Right. Which again, nobody really liked it unless you grew up on Spanish novellus, but it fills you in on what was going on.

Speaker 1:          03:20:30       Like she goes, like right now, Castro just took her fucking house. So when you say she taped, they taped like a Spanish novella. You mean like Telemundo? Novella. But they made this into a TV show, 80 fucken episodes. I'm up to 33, 80 episodes. Eight episodes the first season. I don't know what it is. I just find somebody called me and turn me onto it. But it's not that interesting. Like the singing is cool and I remember growing up and listening to some of those songs and my mom is ball. What's going on as they break down the gay thing in Cuba, what I told you, they used to take them shark island thing and throw him off the boat. Like this fucking kid was saying my father left the house because I was gay. Like it was so taboo when if you were dark skinned, like if you were any dark skin at all in Cuba, they would hate you.

Speaker 1:          03:21:17       Joe Rogen so when Castro got in there and made it easier, but Tiesta was robin people, but Pisa was just a piece of shit. I mean, but these two were such a piece of shit that 20 years after he was gone, they were hunting down his soldiers in the United States like fucking Nazi soldiers. Like they would get hunted down. These groups of Cubans were hunting them down and fucking beat them and shooting them and shit. That's how much. Because it had become like it. Towards the last five years of Cuba become like, if I pulled you over, I just beat you, fucked up. Took your car and that was it. But for eight years, Cuba, Fidel sat in those mountains. It's like taken over La and sending up and fucking San Francisco for eight years waiting for the opportunity and it breaks it down along the way how they.

Speaker 1:          03:22:05       It was easy for them to take home. It was like stealing for. They were waiting for fidelity to take over the revolution. It is pretty crazy. He's still in control. It's fucking crazy. I mean this real, you know, and I knew this, anybody like that out there now besides him, that, that took a country by force and still has control of it all these years later. Oh, he just wanted to people's houses and said, that's my, you know, this show doesn't touch on the casinos, but he walked into the casinos and said, go ahead, call the mafia. It's mine. You show them. They show the Cubans, take him to all the American embassy people. What they do to them. Just took him on the arm and walked into the airport. I have a nice life. Wow. You know, they nationalized all the businesses. It was just something that you don't think about.

Speaker 1:          03:22:57       I don't think about it. You know, I'm, I'm Americanized. Whatever the fuck. But it is the acting sensation. It's just a little too much music. Like you. It's subtitles. It's all Spanish. When she, you say that she was huge in Cuba. Like all. She was huge worldwide compared to someone up today. Like what would you compare it to when they use this? When used in 1956, she had her first gold out. Holy Shit. That's a million, right? Yeah. And now go is gold a 500,000 and a million and the people, the owner of the company had to call the fucking wreck. Bandleader over and go, we can't have this check though. She's a darkie arc is don't sell records in Cuba and that going to do it. And he guaranteed them because you ever talk like that. I get a knock. You the fuck out. But if it goes gold, you pay for the studio sessions.

Speaker 1:          03:23:46       If it doesn't go, go, let pam guarantee she became one of the biggest actresses that actresses are not the best looking fucking monster out there. I mean, that was her argument also. She was Haitian, she was Cuban, she was Haitian. I don't know. She probably had nation blood, whatever the fuck it is, but she was fucking Cuban. But uh, you know, they said she wouldn't sell records because she was ugly. She wouldn't sell records because she was dark skinned. Like her actual music and the show. Yeah. Yeah. And her singing and shit. It's pretty fucking intense. But it showed like three star goals for her, like she wasn't going to make it as a fucking dark thing. Uh, you know, they show like what Cuba was going through, like when Fidel fucking goes into a house. And now the last episode I watched you supposed to go perform at the Tropicana for the Common Dante, you know, and she's like, he took my house, now he wants me to go perform from buckhead.

Speaker 1:          03:24:42       I'm not going down there, but she's done that. He's done that with Shay Guevara, you know, and all that shit. So that's the last episode I watched. That was it, but check that out. Episodes of that scares the shit out of me now. Joe Rogan, that kind of time, you'll watch two episodes in bail. It's just, it's kind of different. It's different. Even for me it was a little different at first. I, I stuck with it because I grew up in it and I kind of missed that. Right now I don't have my parents. I kind of missed that. It's constantly in Spanish. It's really good. Cuban actors, there's a couple Mexicans. There's a couple fucking uh, you know, like light skin, Mexico, Julian. We know that Mexicans to talked about Cuba and the fifties. What Cuba was in the fifties are you like in Narcos? I liked it. I liked both seasons. Pretty good. Uh, it was great.

Speaker 2:          03:25:31       I love that fucking show. Did you get enough of that show? Did you watch both seasons? I haven't finished the second season yet. I'm halfway season. Yeah. I loved it. Loved the first season. I'm halfway into the second season, but then I found stranger things and I went off on a tangent and I had a watch that I had to ride that motherfucker right to the end. I love that show.

Speaker 1:          03:25:50       There's a lot of good shows, a lot of good shows out there. West world, Anthony Hopkins,

Speaker 2:          03:25:58       Ed Harris, and Harris has always been a bad mother fucker. Fuck. But this is is a piece Talese lazy sauce. This is the one. This is the role where you know you're going to see him a lot because you know it's many, many, many episodes. So it's like the. The beautiful thing about game of thrones is that it's a giant movie. It's a movie that lasts many, many, many, many seasons and once you get used to that, a regular movies like it's not enough time to tell a story 90 minutes and not enough time to tell a story and you're seeing that with shows like westworld too. It's like they're figuring out a totally new thing and it totally new thing being. There's been shows before, like last and a bunch of other shows where there was a storyline they had to follow through the entire, you know, all seasons and they all kind of connected but not sort of the way they're doing it now.

Speaker 2:          03:26:44       The way they're doing it now is with nudity and swearing and violence and sexuality and it's just, it's all no holds barred. I mean, game of thrones is changed the whole fucking game and now westworld is changing the game too. There's a bunch of these shows like that that are just hbo and Netflix and you know, all these companies that have the budget to put together essentially a movie a week and they get these banging actors and I'm telling you, Ed Harris knocks it out of the park. He's so creepy. He's so creepy. You believe a man, you believe he's the boogeyman. I keep. If you were living in those wild west days and Ed Harris Rides up in a fucking horse outside your town with that creepy fucking smile of his. He can't even kill them. Big Guns don't work on him. Fuck man. It's awesome. Such a good show. I didn't have enough. Joey Diaz speaking. A good show, Jill. We did is. I heard you had a good show in Chicago and I hope we're get hurt. We're going to be to see that shit on

Speaker 1:          03:27:42       December eighth bitches. You were a adzenys right? The Rosemont Rosemont. That's a great club. Just a fun place club. Uh, Eddie Bravo said he saw you down there. He said he had a great fucking time Friday night. We had a good time and then sadly the first show was a little lumpy, but the second show I just got out of my, you know, I, I was trying, I was trying to be Jerry Seinfeld and I had a script really for the first show. Yeah. I was going to stick this just because it's a taping was the first time I had the opportunity. I was going to try to work a little cleaner. I didn't want them to. I didn't want them to look at me and say, this guy, you know, I tell you why I'm a fan of MMA. When I see growth, I love when I watch it, I'm in a fight.

Speaker 1:          03:28:22       When economy, rego fought Nick Diaz the second time, I was so happy that I finally, somebody is doing what I'm talking about. You go back, you look at your mistakes and you go back to and correct them at the same time. You show up with a new weapon. Don't keep telling me that you're the hardest hitter in the UFC lightweight division. I don't want to hear that because it's not about the hardest headed. I don't want to hear that no more. So I thought about my special from that perspective and I go, if I watch my special, if I do come on the foot joke. They're gonna know he never grew from. They never really. So I really wanted to try it. You know what I'm saying? Like, but see that's they fuck with your head band because those come in, the foot jokes are great.

Speaker 1:          03:28:58       No, I don't like them. I just don't want to kill time and I'm lazy, but I just wanted to do something that was me but not. So I worked at that way, the first ride tried to be Jerry Seinfeld and it kind of worked a little bit. The technique was there, but the old business wasn't. Then I thought about the and I said, fuck this. I'm going to change this all up. I'm going to go out this motherfucker Capello. So second fellow human that's been their management order. No order, no nothing. I Capello whatever the jokes. I didn't want to use old jokes, nothing like that. It was all fresh stuff and it worked out, man. I'm happy I did it 25 years. It's done. You know what we should do next? It's going to take another one. You know, we should do next. We should do like a Rodney dangerfield special type thing with all of us with like red and you and Duncan and put it together and you know, and do the same.

Speaker 1:          03:29:54       The way that Ronnie's still, where they have like four or five comics go on and do like 15 minutes, you know, you know sometimes that gets stuck with comedy and I go back to those in my world. It was a great Kennison on their dice, on their bill. Hicks taught me an education because fucking Andrew went up there and leveled the room level level I would have ran out of that. Andrew dice clay and Bill Hicks went up there with the composure, slow them down with a cigarette, smooth as a cucumber, socked him in dark, cool as a cucumber. Suck them into a web of fucking are with it. Turned into something else. A shop boy. Schimmel destroyed that dom. I rarer and Clark

Speaker 2:          03:30:40       and Clark droid it crushed always been my go to when I'm fucking up with stand up and Seinfeld Seinfeld fucked it up. There was a couple of great people that. Who else? Robert Townsend. Roseanne Barr? Yeah. Yeah. Barry Sobel. Barry Sobel. That's a leather jacket on, right? Barry Sobel. Who went on to being punchline. Yeah. We really should do that. Joey, why don't we do that? That should be our next thing. Set it up. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah, and do it that way. We could do another special quick, like you do this special. Then we can do another one in like seven or eight months or something like that. We'd all have 20 solid minutes at seven or eight months. We could throw on another show. This is tremendous edibles. Fuck No. Why? Because even if it don't get your high, your breadth is fucking minty fresh. After that.

Speaker 2:          03:31:31       It feels good and my mom tastes great mind to. So it's on Seeso and isn't there something where you can sign up for free? Yeah, I got a cold day. I listened to the podcast and I give out the CSO coding to get two free months. I'll give it to you. November 25th. So you got until January as you get the special fucking free. Come on, Joel Diaz. Doug Stan hope is on. That's right. They're doing some other stuff too. I've designed that. Oh, they shoot a ton of shit. They're going to be the official comedy. They want to go for it. They want to go for it and they want, well, you know what, I think these, all these new networks are going to open up the same way that Netflix has done. It's going to. It's obviously a very, very good model and they're realizing that now that's going to be the future.

Speaker 2:          03:32:11       It's these networks like CBS and NBC and ABC. Boy, they're going to have a hard time in a few years staying afloat. Well, let's think about it. What's Netflix? How much a month? Nine bucks. Nine bucks. Three $99 for CSO. CSO is only going to be a sports one. That's going to be like $2. Pretty soon you're going to be spending $21 and you're going to get programming from fucking Mars. Yeah. What does he have? What's on it? They have a small office. It's an NBC thing. NBC, so they've got everything. NBC, he was all 40 years Saturn, live side that live and see all, but I guess they will. They're starting. Yeah, I guess they went after a lot of comedians. Specials is already doing this thing on Seeso. I'm not sure. They have like original networking on them, like original programming network. You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

Speaker 2:          03:33:05       That's awesome. It's tremendous. Well I think that's the future. The future is those. I mean like Netflix didn't become netflix overnight. There was something I was watching online with. This guy was talking about big companies and companies to look for and you know, it was companies like Google and apple and big technology companies. Anything that Netflix is going to be one of the next big technology companies. You look at the growth and we'll get what it's worth now and what it's projected to be worth like in 2020 and it's like it just keeps growing and growing and as more and more people abandoned cable like less and less people are getting cable. More and more people are getting their TV from Netflix and you know, the thing is the idea of watching something. You have to be home at 8:00 and going to be sitting there waiting.

Speaker 2:          03:33:45       It seems archaic. It seems archaic to wait for a show. And what Netflix also does to get you in turn you into a junkie is they. You could just binge. He could just sit there and watch all the narcos episodes. Just sit there. I'll come home with a knife. We don't stand up to unwind the watching an episode of fucking fuck. Yeah. I liked that. Bestowed seven. That's all. That's been one of my favorite episodes of television the last 20 years. Episode Seven. Law as Pinata. I don't know what was when he kills the two guys and puts them in the oven the first season to the arts. Who was driving the stealing from him and Gada. That was dark when he did that episode. That's when I knew we were onto some fucking. His acting is fucking second to none right now. That duke is out act motherfuckers.

Speaker 2:          03:34:34       He's a skinny dude that walks fat. I've never seen that. What he put on a lot of weight for that role, that role. I've never seen that shit. Yeah, you buy it. You buy. He who? He, you know, he's pretending to be a good fucking show. There's a lot of good stuff out there these days, but Joey Diaz is on Seeso, December eighth. Motherfuckers. What's it called when you calling it sociably. Unacceptable. Sociably. Unacceptable. Socially or sociably? I have no fucking idea what the questions. Just go. The Cecil December right now. Might change the title by that time. So it's A. Have you edited it all? Yeah, I got a couple of edits. It looks fucking tremendous. Beautiful. Um, so um, when they put it up you can just stream it live, right? It's just awesome. And then again, if you want to get on and get on it now because Doug Stanhope is already on Seeso and you can check out his thing to Joey's is December eighth.

Speaker 2:          03:35:30       I'll definitely have you on before them. We'll let her know for pops up and we're doing new year's Eve motherfuckers. Home of Ebi with Tony Golden Pony. Hinchcliffe A. I think it's almost sold out. There was a very, I think there less than 100 tickets left as of this week. So don't sleep. You know, I came up here to promote something, but what is it on the way up here? They were like, Joey, there's only 60 tickets. I didn't know. I thought that. What is it, the willow when you're doing the Wilbur November 11th. Oh Shit. Well let them know if you're in Boston. That's fucking theater is one of the best theaters to see stand up because it's three tiers and it's stacked right in front of you. So it's a big ass crowd, but it feels like a small crowd because each it's like there's three small crowds that sort.

Speaker 2:          03:36:17       It's like it's like three, 300 seat comedy clubs stacked on top of each other. Places got foxwoods and even that night was selling tickets. I was like, that let's just bail on it because it's UFC. See Two, oh five. Everybody's little watch UFC 205. They're like, no, we're selling tickets. I said, okay, well if people could stay off their fucking phones and just hit that Dvr and just la La la La la and not listened to the radio is a drive home, blah blah, blah, blah blah. And then get in front of the TV. They can watch it like as if it was a live event. So they could see you. And then go watch the fights. This motherfucker's all right folks. That's it. That's the end. That's the end for this week. I'm going out of town. I got to go kill some deers with bows and arrows. See a deer. No S and a be back soon. Bye. Love you guys. Shit at it.
