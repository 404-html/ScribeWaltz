Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Boom, and we're live. Why are you calling? I'm alright. How are you going on? A lot of stuff happening, man. Yeah, yeah. First of all, thank you so much. Pleasure. This is amazing. Well, Dave Rubin recommends you. I listened to Dave Room is. I don't want to send a whole lot of people's recommendations, but Dave Rubin's one of them. He's been an amazing figure in my life. Just in the last lesson, even a month. And he just, he's kind of was like my savior when like everyone was kicking me while I was down. He was the one that kind of reached a handout and so I owe him a great deal. Well, we should kind of explain what kicking you while you're down means because it's silly to me than anything because it doesn't really make sense, but you tweeted a joke and it's a real simple joke.

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       Jamie, see if he could pull up the joke. This is what happened. Collin tweeted a joke about a day without a woman and uh, everybody knows that a day without what, without a woman was like that day without a Mexican thing where you were supposed to like, well, imagine if there were no women. Well, if there were no women, first of all, there'd be no fucking people. So yeah. Yes. Women are super important for. So you just write this tweet joke, a peace and quiet hashtag a day without a woman. I would laugh. I would think it was funny and I would move on and that's it. So then all the, hold on a second, put put, put that Olivia, look, look, go above that, go above that. Above it. We'll get that. Sent this tweet, which was roundly condemned as sexist. Yeah. Not really true if you leave the gaming industry, but a rapidly condemned in the gaming industry for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       Outside of that, people I think normal everyday, people that don't have an ax to grind about literally everything found it, you know, reddit maybe growing or maybe laughed and then kept going about their day. Like a normal person. You're not allowed to have any personality anymore. No. If you work for any kind of accompany that is in any way public where you can be targeted, where they can say, oh, that's the fucking God. Go get them. Like anything that's remotely controversial. I mean that is a really remotely controversial. It's just Al Bundy. Yeah, I mean it's not even a good joke. And, and uh, you know, yeah. It's, I, I heard you and Jim Norton talking about it by the way, that video that someone clipped that out and put it up on some youtube channel that's like a, that's like a, that video is going to be irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       My family forever. Everyone was like, I can't believe this. What is going on? This is so great so far. I really do appreciate you stepping up. And when I got your DM, by the way on twitter, I was like, this is what an amazing turn of events this has been for me. So I, I really am appreciative of you. Again, I want you to know that. Thank you. Thank you. Stop saying it makes me uncomfortable. But uh, but uh, at the same time, uh, you know, I, I was in bed with my girlfriend actually when I wrote it and I showed it to her and I was like, this is kind of funny, right? It's kind of stupid. And she laughed. She, she's an er nurse and she works the overnight shift so she was just getting into bed as I was getting up and she's like, yeah, it was funny. Then we didn't really think twice about it. I sent it, I got in the shower, I went about my day and uh, and then when I got to work I realized that it was a much bigger deal than I had thought and it was, and then everything fell apart and then it was rebuilt very quickly. So. Well

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you resigned from the company that you worked for? Yeah, I found that I founded the company I owned a piece of. And you resigned because of that? Yeah, yeah. Other reasons too. But I mean that was definitely the straw that broke the camel's back for me yet. What in the fuck, man? Yeah, it was just, I felt like, how is it, how is it possible that in this day and age, that simple tweet, by the way, if you reverse the sexes in that tweet, there's not a single man that would complain and if he did, he's not a man. Yeah, I agree. And I say also that if a person that wasn't a self described like moderate conservative or libertarian sent that joke, it also wouldn't have gotten the firestorm. That's the thing Joe, is that you don't think a liberal man wouldn't have gotten a rash of shit and been sort of, I think out of the community maybe in a different maybe in a different place, but not in the gaming industry, which is almost completely hyper liberal.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       So I've had a target on my back for years and that's I think kind of the point that's lost on some people is that this was just an opportunity. No one was offended by this joke. No one was a gas, like I said on Rubin, and the second time I was on there I said like no one was crying in their shower, losing sleep, tossing and turning over. They had shown was, well, I hope so because that's what we should find that person and that person is studied them in a lab. But to me I was like, no, this is. I mean, it was, it was clear. A few hours later when I finally realized what was happening, I'm like, this is, they're in for the kill now. This is, this is. They found their way to get me. And so why do you think they wanted to quote unquote get you?

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       Uh, because, you know, I live in San Francisco. I've lived there for 10 years. I was born and raised on long island, but I went to college in Boston and then I moved to San Francisco and um, it is as cartoonishly liberal as everyone thinks it is. So it's, it's, and the gaming industry is there, the gaming media, the people that write about games and cover them and do all that kind of stuff there. They're largely there and it's a huge echo chamber. They don't like when people penetrate the Echo Chamber and uh, I made a name for myself in the industry over years. I was the senior editor of the biggest gaming website in the world for years, but websites, [inaudible] dot com. And uh, and I was the senior editor there and uh, I made a name for myself, not only with criticism and with long form pieces but, but, but basically I was writing pieces about political correctness in 2011 and 2012 people going after game developers.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       People going after all these things and me kind of standing up and saying, this isn't okay. This character assassination. A good example for everyone out there that doesn't know games. There's this game called borderlands two. One of the developers was giving an interview about it. He, uh, and this was back in I think 2011. He said something to the nature of this mode. This particular mode in the game is accessible for everyone. It's like a girlfriend mode if you want your girlfriend to come play. This was like a. He said, girl, he insinuated that women can't play games and don't know how to play games where everybody using the term girlfriend when people went after this guy and tried to get them, you know, and I, I wrote this piece saying like, what the Hell is everyone doing? This guy just is trying to explain something, he's not as sexist. Why do you make these assumptions based on this one thing about him and why do you want to ruin someone? And that's the whole thing. They want to ruin people. So I was outspoken about this and I was outspoken for my supportive Mitt Romney and I was outspoken about my sport for Gary Johnson and my house book. So they don't like that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       They don't like that stuff. And, and, and, uh, I think that's pretty clear now. So you feel like there's a sort of a reinforced type of thinking, like a very liberal, reinforced type of thinking that you must subscribe to if you want to be a part of this? Yes. It's an orthodoxy. It's a complete and utter orthodoxy and it's, it's, it's what's so nice about this, like the unintended consequence that I think is the silver lining of the dark cloud is people from the outside. Now Saul firsthand, like what I had been saying for a long time, which was, which was like I was kind of on the fringe. I was kind of being pushed out and I got out literally thousands of people tweeting. I mean facebook message me and doing everything being like, wow, this is fucking crazy. These people really are out to get you.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Based on that, you know, you would think, uh, I, I said some horrible, just offensive, just truly awful thing. Do you think they're really out to get you or do you think they're capitalizing on a moment where they feel like you have a target on you and they'll like kick him? He's down. We got them and some days, but this reaction culture that we have like this over overreaction culture that we find ourself in today, it really does seem to foster that kind of behavior that people really like it when someone gets caught doing something or when someone says something inappropriate when you could just point the finger and then everybody can pile on. Yeah, I think, well let me put it a different way because I think you're probably right in a sense in the sense that I. I never gained the benefit of the doubt with this group.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       Let's put it that way. Right. So. So it was one thing. It was just the one thing that dominoes there was tipped and it was in that and they were down as opposed to. That's why I brought up the example before of if one of the people that they actually liked within that insular industry said the same thing. They might have been a gas but they may might have reached a handout or given that person a second chance. So I think that that all plays into the, you know, I have it the Gadsden flag as my twitter, I kind of had that first, since 2009. I am, you know, I've not been shots and flag being don't tread on one of the snake. Right, exactly. Um, uh, so there are just certain things that may be very different than other people in the industry. And I think that I definitely think that that plays a.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       what's your twitter name is no taxation, which is a reference to the American revolution, which I know, you know, a lot of people think, well, no, no taxes. I'm like, that's not what it means. I can't, I can't fit no taxation without representation on twitter. That's why it doesn't say that. Yeah, that would be a long ass. Yeah. Unnecessarily long. You'd have no room for tweets, but it would make you very economical with your words. That's what I love about twitter. You probably feel the same way. I write something really long sometimes. Then I have to Parse it and figure out how to make it fit. And it feels so very good for joke writing, like for, for the skill of joke writing to make to make things more concise. Like I always tell people that I think the greatest joke writer or the greatest comedian is Joey Diaz because he says he gives you the most amount of visuals and impact with the least amount of words.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       It's just ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba. He knows how to like sink it in really quickly. And twitter's like a good tool for that. But not if that's a little ridiculous. That's because you only back. I don't know if that's the case how it is now, but we'll actually. It definitely is. Right? Like if I write to you, if I reply to you, your name takes up a big chunk of what tweet for you, but what you tweet doesn't take up. So it's like the 140 characters would be limiting people that respond to you rather than you tweeting. Yeah, exactly. And the beauty is to, as you've probably noticed, is that I think in the last year or whatever, they images you have to take up characters too and the videos and links and I think the links are the only thing left that takes up the extra characters in addition to the name, but it keeps everyone, Kurt.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       But that doesn't stop people from tweeting 7,000 times in a row and put numbers on them. I've done it too. Yeah, I know I did it just yesterday when I ran into some woman in San Francisco that I was walking my dog. I have a Boston terrier. She was like a little sicker. Her poop was a little wet so I went and picked it up and I left like, you know, just like smear, you'd have to use your fingernails to get off the ground. So the woman came out of her apartment and started scolding me. Like she was waiting by the, by the window to scold me for this. And I like, what the Hell is going on? So I had to tweet out a few tweets about that just for it. For posterity. Yeah, to the twitter thing is very weird, but here's something that I really don't like and I'm glad I don't see much of it anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:09:53       Is that twit longer? Shit. Hey, that's a loophole. Yeah, we don't do that. Don't do that. Ralphie may's do that shit all the time. He used to read his tweets. I'm like, what the fuck? Ralphie, while you're writing paragraphs here, you know what's going on? Yeah. Some people, you know, I've done it to a put. We'll like go in in photoshop and make a paragraph of text and then make that the image that you will do that on instagram too. Oh yeah, I've done that before. I've drawn written things down and then taking a photo. I said I was going to do that for awhile. That I think that twitter is just too impersonal. I'm going to write all my stuff out and then take a picture of it, but I was just fucking around. I think if that's the exception, the exception, I think it's totally fine.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       I don't want people to ruin in twitter. I like the Curtis. Yeah, it's good. It's good. It's good format, but it also makes it extremely easy for people to do what happened to you. Yeah, exactly. Because there are nuances lost, right? Yeah. He wants his last. Well, it's always lost in text. I mean, we're in writing. It's very difficult. Even if you're reading a book, sometimes you have to go over the previous paragraphs. We'll figure out exactly how this guy was setting this up, but I think what's. What's happening, what you're saying. I see there's two parts of one. The example you gave before about the guy saying that like girlfriend mode, if he just said, it's like say if your girlfriend doesn't play video games and she wants to really easily accessible, you could do it that way, but I'd be. People probably would attack them even for that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       It would say, what are you implying that girls don't play video games? Well, that's the impulse. It's always the implication, right? Like everyone's always out to assume the absolute worst announced. We're always trying to write about like this guy is just trying to make an example. He's probably given 15 pr interviews today. He's probably exhausted. He is also a developer so he doesn't have much PR training. He's trying to just get the point across. Why do you have to assume the man is a sexist and a messages because of this one thing. It, it, it's, I'm willing to die on that hill because I feel like people deserve the benefit of the doubt. People deserve to make a mistake or get a joke wrong or you know, all those kinds of things. And I feel like yes, people are allowed to exercise their free speech on the other enemy. Like I don't like that joke or I don't like this or I don't like that, but it's, it doesn't stop there

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       with what's going on with Dave Chappelle this week. I thought it was really actually interesting. Uh, with his two specials on Netflix. People were freaking out about, you know, his jokes, his, his jokes about gay people or transgender people wherever. Well as comparing transgender people to black people and you know, and saying that it's a ridiculous comparison, right? Like, like I, I actually, after I saw the, all the, all the stuff I went and watched the first one that I watched half of the second one and I was falling asleep so I didn't want to watch it anymore, but I was like, this is funny. And uh, uh, Anthony Jeselnik or Daniel tosh would make these people shit their pants compared to the, to what's going on with this kind of stuff. And it's always this drama that seeks to kind of, it, it doesn't stop at saying like, I don't like it. It's often insinuated or outright spoken that they want to censor it or change it. That's where I am because I was reading a piece specifically about chappelle where they're like, this guy calls up questions as to why, like how far should comedy go? And I'm like, no, that doesn't, that doesn't call. And that's when the free speech argument ends for me. That's what I'm like. You're actually now talking about changing it. Well, it doesn't work. It doesn't work with US

Speaker 3:          00:12:57       comics. It just doesn't work. We're not going to do it. It's too many people like it. And I understand what they're trying to do because when they live in that world of cubicles and human resources and very restricted patterns of behavior that you have to follow, if you live in an office environment and working in an office environment or other, you know, there's a lot of people out there that are boxed into these terrible situations where you have to pretend to be this thing that you're not and you again, you don't have any personality, you don't. You're not allowed to say anything ridiculous or silly. And when you, you have that kind of environment and you see someone who's free, like Dave Chappelle, you, you want to stop it. And if you can, if you can point something out that can, oh look, he's saying something that's inappropriate.

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       He's saying something I don't agree with. He's saying something. Let's get them, let's go get them. And then also in defense of the writers that are writing these articles, look, they're in a bizarre environment where they have to fucking constantly defend like their position. They have to constantly get clicks. They have to constantly get hits. They can't just put an article out and nobody reads it. They'll lose their job, so they have to write about something that's inflammatory, write about something that's salacious, something that's going to get people excited. I mean that guy that wrote that thing about you for the International Business Times. I looked into that international business times and one of the things about it is that there was a. I think it was a mother Jones article about that website where they were told that the people who write articles were given some ridiculous task like they have to get 10,000 hits per article. They write, so that might have for people don't know. There was a guy who wrote an article about Collin where it said kind of funnies. Collin Moriarty was resigns after writing a joke, a racist joke that targeted women. It wasn't racist, even remote in the slightest, but when you take into account the environment that these people are forced work in and

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       you say, well, this guy literally, it's forced to write something that's more fucked up than it really is. So you have to get people excited about this. In a way that's going to get them to click on it and hopefully get him to his 10,000 hit quota. If that is true, I feel for him in a way I feel. I mean I think he's working for a shitty business, but it's the same way I feel. I mean, I, I actually, you know, I came from the editorial world where you have to get clear. I mean we were getting, our expectations were way higher. And um, did you have those kind of requirements? No, no, not literally. I know some sites do, but both sides have all your quota, a quota or like you get bonuses if you get a certain amount of hits or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       And we didn't have that. We were salaried or whatever, but you would be fired ultimately if you weren't writing things that people were reading. But I tried to stay out of my way for writing inflammatory things. Actually there are a couple of examples where I wouldn't write a story because I felt like it wasn't pertinent to any information and it was specifically to assassinate someone's character when we found a problem. Here you have fucking morals, dude. Where's the door? Like no room in this business. I had a, I had a high, a high profile woman in the gaming industry. Tell me in an interview that was unrelated to what I was actually interviewing her that she'd never was once the victim of sexism in the industry ever. And that was, and I was like, I could write this, but this isn't why I was there to, you know, I wasn't interviewing her about this and this is going to cause her problems and that's not who I am.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       I don't. I caused her problem because then people are going to. Then people are gonna jump on and be like, well, you know, I experienced this, I experienced this and you're diminishing and we'll just cause her drama. I'm like, why would I do that? It's not. See, this is where it drives me crazy. That's a beautiful example of people being cool if she can say, Hey, I've never experienced any sexism in his business. You'd be like, wow, the gaming industry must be really cool and this woman has managed to get through the maze with a bunch of high fives and people appreciating her work. Wouldn't that be celebrated? Not In the gaming and you know what I'm saying? Like why does that have to be in some ways a target like why is that story at target? Like wouldn't you assume that if there is a person who can reach a high level of prominence in this very complicated business, right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       I mean the gaming industry is incredibly complicated, especially how weighted everything is when it comes to male versus female stuff. That whole Gamergate shit exposed so much of that, which was really confusing to people in the outside. Especially people like me who don't play games. Right. I was like, what in the fucking shooting these gamer people. Yeah. It's confusing to me too. I mean the, the second story, I think it was more pertinent though, which was this guy had this guy worked at a big publisher. He was and he was laid off and he had like this huge meltdown on social media and people were writing about it and I was like, I knew him personally and not wasn't really friendly with them at the time, but I knew him personally and I was like, and reverence that we should write about this, and I'm like, what is this? What is the serving? Like, what was the meltdown? He just, he just had, he was just going off about how he was just angry and sad. He's a young kid that finally got in and then he his grip on

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       the, on the job and was and was laid off, whatever, and he's fine now he's back in the industry, but the. I was like, I think I wasn't cut out to be like this hard core, like don't get them journalism like at any cost because I was like, this is going to ruin this. Like why would I want to contribute to this, to this, to this. I didn't get into this industry to, to the pile on people to ruin their lives. I got into this industry to celebrate video games, to tell interesting stories about games, to challenge people's minds and I always tried to take that with me where I was like, I'm not going to write anything for the clicks I could. I could, I could write. These ladies had salacious headlines, a I can write this, this, this dirt or this, this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       I heard whatever, but that's not who I am. That's not who I want to be, and I'd rather contribute more positively to, to the ecosystem. Then then be like, well, I'll just get clicks for this today and this guy has got to read the story and it's going to be in Google and Lexis nexis forever and it's going to, for what? So I can get 50,000 clicks one day and then just move on. He's not gonna be able to move on. He didn't even do anything that is worthy of being writing about. We writing about this. Why are we always after people while you're mindset is noble? I mean, it is a great way to look at things. It's, it's weird that it's so unusual, you know, and that most people would be more self serving and would choose the path going to get them the most clicks and hey, I've got a fucking crack, a few eggs to make an omelet.

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       That's how it goes. Yeah. And that's not because I don't want, I never wanted the Canon to be turned on me even though it was eventually. You don't know what I mean. The cat hates like the try to put out that energy that you want, that's, that's positive or at least constructive. If someone like murder someone in the gaming industry. Yes. That's noteworthy. We should probably write about that if someone just depends on who they're murdered. Right. Well, what do you mean when someone's a terrible person that murdered them? Like punisher style? Well, that's different. I guess we can. We can have that conversation I guess. Yeah, no, I know what you're saying, man. I agree with you. It's, it's again, it's knowable. What would your mindset, your philosophy is very noble and I wish more people shared it and I think that when there's all these people scrambling around like we're seeing now and you know, trying to find their niche and trying to get attention and you find more of that kind of a predatory behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       Yeah, I agree as well. That brings me back to what we were saying specifically about we feel bad for these writers at these sites and to me like the analogy I draw is like I hate the Tsa, right? There's normal people that work for the TSA that are just trying to do their thing, but that doesn't mean I don't hate the system that they work under and think the system should change and it's the same thing here. It's like these. Yeah, these guys are victimized by the set of circumstances in which they under which they have to write, but that doesn't mean that the system should remain the same because they need to write those stories. Talk about the TSA because I don't know more about that than I know about business or about your business rather. Sure. Like what, what do you hate about the Tsa? They're infringing on your fourth amendment rights. The warrantless searches a day legally sees things. I mean, this is written very clearly in the bill of rights. So, and I hate the whole argument of like, well, you, you don't have, you know, are you, you, um, you kind of pass by your rights or give them up when you're in the airport. And I'm like, no, they're, they're inalienable actually. So I just have a huge problem. I don't have a problem going through a metal detector or something reasonable. A reasonable search. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Well it's, it's kind of reasonable because there are carbon fiber blades and all these different plastic blades that they can make now that you could really fuck somebody up that are, I'm not going to show up in a metal detector. Sure. But it goes back to the first of all, you know, I don't think that we're going to have many problems on airplanes anymore. I think that they're moving, moving onto something else and no plane is going to get hijacked. And now that everyone knows what's going to happen. But Dude, as soon as you think like that, that's when something happens. That's, that can be, that can be a relevant argument. I also wanna give a shout out that serious things happen. My Dad's in New York, a retired New York City firefighter. So it's, it's quit. Very cool. I knew people that died that day, but it's still, you know, and my dad could have died that day depending on the circumstances.

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       Thank God he didn't. But to me it was like I just would. Right. It's like the old Benjamin Franklin thing, you know, it's balancing, uh, your, your liberty, your freedom with security. And I think that we've, we've, we've given them so much power with Patriot Act, with the Tsa, with all these things where I'm like, this is a bad road to go to, to go down and they're just going to take more and more. So yeah. What is the Benjamin Franklin quote? He who value safety over. Yeah, over over liberty deserves neither safety nor liberty. Yeah. I think the TSA has a ridiculously hard job. And I think the requirements that people have, the what, what people request of them to make sure that they're safe and then you give them $10 an hour or whatever the fuck they make, they don't make much. Of course you get is a bunch of underqualified people who are tired and they're tired of working like the constant flow.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       If you watch how I like to study people at the airport because I feel like it's one of the rare times where you could just stare at people while they're doing their job and no one gets weird with you because everybody staring at that guy or that girl that's taking your license and scanning your ticket and all that jazz. So I just stare at him and I watch how they, how they interact with all these people and people are fucking tired. That's what I see. I see. I see frustration. I see so many people in these lines and I see people just being exhausted. And then the people that have to deal with the people that don't take their shoes off. Sorry, you have to take your shoes out. Why would I take my shoes off? Take your fucking shoes off man. You see that kind of thinking, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       It just there on the edge all the time. So you're not dealing with them. We'll start taking shoes off because it's going through this thing. It's not like he has one guy's dealing with short whole day. He's dealing with this constant river of human beings that are coming through and some of them have water bottles and you got to make sure those dangerous water bottles don't get on the plane. There's a lot of stupid shit that goes with the TSA, but how the fuck else are you going to keep people from bringing shoe bombs or knives on planes and it's really hard to do. No, it is I, I mean I don't, I don't think that the, the, the, the counterpoint would be to just get rid of it. You just walk into a terminal and be able to get on an airplane. But I remember, you know, remember too, and a lot of people do.

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       We had a security apparatus before nine, 11. These guys out smarter this security apparatus by doing very specific things, including like knowing how to fly planes and doing all the things that you can't possibly check for and also people get guns and knives and weapons intentionally through the, through the Tsa all the time to I think wasn't it something like over 90 percent of agents that we're trying to get through things through the TSA succeeded. So these are, these are the people standing in between us and isis. People do it accidentally all the time. They have stuff in their bag and it gets through and then they go, what the fuck? You know? I mean it happens all the time. Yeah. I knew a guy that, that brought a ton of weed overseas on accident, you know, like that's terrifying. Like here's a shit like me too.

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       Like I go through my bed just for anything you might leave in there and your, the expert. I always come through just make sure there's nothing, you know, you never know what's going to happen, but to the point he didn't mean to do that. Right. But it was there, it was. So yeah. It's, it's not a perfect system and it's not going to be, and that's just the way it is. It would be nice if it was more efficient. It would be nice that people got paid better. It'd be nice if it was easier and quicker. There'd be a lot of. It would be nice, but I don't know of anybody that's come up with a better system for scanning people and making sure that they don't bring guns or bombs or whatever the fuck it is on an airplane. It's just bizarre that airplanes are the one place where we have so much fucking security were malls which are filled with way more people than your average plane.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       There's something about terror and flying where it's already terrifying, like, yeah, you think you're scared now, bitch, what if it blows up in the fucking guy? Dude pulls a fucking turbine out of his bag and wraps around his head and starts lightened his underwear on fire. You know? That's. That's what we're scared of. We're scared of someone taking it to the next level because people are already tensed. Yeah, because you're in a metal tube hurling through the sky at 500 miles an hour. If it blows up while you're doing that, it's even more freaky. Oh my God. It's horrifying. Let me a weird. It's terrifying, but it's kind of strange. Whereas like that seems to be like the preferred method of terror like that we're really worried about which is why the TSA exist in the first place because the volume of humans that go through a lot of places, it's probably commensurate with the volume of humans that go through the airport.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       Oh sure. You don't have a single place that you could mention that's as strict with what you carry around as the airport. You could walk into the fucking mall with a loaded gun any day of the week, any day of the week. Every single time I walk on the mall, I am just never checked. Nobody. Nobody frisks me. I don't go there. Any metal detectors. You could walk in arm to the fucking teeth and that. Who's going to stop you? The mall security guard. The Fuck Outta here and his little. His little sub during Christmas time, there are thousands of people at the mall. Thousands, thousands and thousands. Yeah, I agree. I mean that's, it's like it's more like the Israeli experience where I like this. This kind of shit can happen at any time anywhere and they're very vigilant about that. I've often wondered that as well, like why doesn't even at a security checkpoint in a, in an airport, why not just do what they're like? And I really think it's that they, you know, to your point with the mall and all these kinds of things in the public places, I think it just speaks to the fact that most people, a vast majority people are just good, decent people that want to go about their lives for sure. And that these terrorists could target all of these different places. I don't think they do. Maybe because they can't, but probably more because they don't want to

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       give themselves away for something that might be seen as minor. Like, like nine slash 11 was a spectacle. It wasn't only that 3000 some odd people died. It was that. It was the spectacle of killing those people in that way and so I think that there's something about that as well, which is why I'm more scared about like a dirty bomb or something like that today than I am of anyone taking an airplane over because everyone knows what happened in 2001. So now someone pulls out a knife on an airplane and try. Someone's just going to tackle that guy and probably kill him. That's why I'm not sure. That's why the guy. Yeah, I know the guy tried to blow his shoe up or something like that on the plane. That's why we have to take our shoes off now. But uh, yeah. To me I'm like the, the, the, the threat has changed that the threat is evolving and we can be vigilant in all these ways, but then I wonder it's, it goes back to like Nsa and all these things like how much are we going to give the government and how much are we going to give up in order for safety?

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       I'd rather live in a more dangerous world first, personally, and know that no one's reading my text messages or no one's throwing out my hand lotion or harassing. I saw these, these two women, Australian women in the airport at Sfo. When I came down to La last week, they were in wheelchairs. They were going through all of their stuff and like. And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing to these people? I just leave them alone and I actually went up to them afterwards and I'm like, I'm sorry. We hate these people too. Just so you know. So this is not okay with any of us that were there. They were there for like a half an hour ago. They had these frowns on their faces. They looked dejected. This might be their first time in the states for all I know or predict map. Here's what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       You come over here, check your shit, take your pants off. When he got in there, it's like, what are you packing? The harassing old women? They're harassing, harassing. I, I think I saw in jfk once, like going through like a nun's bang or something like, what? This is madness to me, I'm like, this is not everyone's turning on each other, but it's not because if it wasn't, if they didn't go through everyone thoroughly and they, oh, we're going to let nuns go through. And then what happened? Somebody dressed as a nun and they act as a terrorist or they are a terrorist. I liked the, uh, someone that I don't know much about it, you probably know more about it than I do, but someone was telling me a little bit about the Israel, the way the Israelis do airport security specifically that it's, they, it's like all about, uh, it's, they're not profiling, but even based on race or anything, they're profiling based on your behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       And it goes to your point like these are well paid professional people that know what the fuck they're doing, know what they're looking for and they're in the airport and they see someone just acting a little weird and they also do some crazy shit. Like, I had a friend who went there and she took photos of um, some, uh, antisemetic a pictures, some like Nazi swastikas on something. So, you know what the Israeli guys did at the airport. They shot her computer and they gave it back. Really? Yes. She's. Yeah. So there's, that's a little over the top. Yeah. So there's that a little more balanced than that. Can we see you a computer. And they opened up her computer. Terrible Israeli accent. Not even know where to go with it there. I just put a fucking hoe she heard dunk dunk and they gave her back her fucking computer. That's a half hour later. That's, that's some, that's a little too strong for me. But uh, to your point, to the point like, I don't know what this is, I just don't like the security theater aspect of it. We all know what's going on. Everyone's being inconvenienced. These people are miserable. We're miserable. It's just, it goes back down to no one wants to make

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       hard decisions or I'll even do what, like really hard work. Like what works, what doesn't, let's do studies. Let's figure out what, what we're doing instead of looking at people naked and machines and will you also have to take the, well, you don't really see anyone naked machines anymore. That's not real. I know, but back in the day, but even back in the day it was just like, come on man. What are you worried about? What people are so silly? Worried about people seeing me naked. But the, the, the um, the thing that gets to me though is like, how can you make it safer? No one has offered up any sort of an alternative to the TSA that makes any sense to me. I mean, I've heard people say the Tsh and competent, I fucking hate them. They no violation of fourth amendment, but there's no, there's no alternatives that I've seen that they're even remotely responsible.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       No, I mean I, I think it goes back to me of like, I can't speak necessarily to the level of competence because I'm not insecurity. I don't know. Like what specifically do. I don't know what their level of training is. It just goes back to the constitutionality of it. Like if we, if we, and it brings up those tough questions, it's the same way I feel about about the second amendment. If we start seeding what this means in certain situations, then before you know it, they'll just continue to erode it away. Like, and um, so when I'm like, this is a warrantless search, this is by definition a warrantless search. If you went and got John Jay and James Madison and all these guys and ask the and somehow told them what the fuck was going on. And then instead like what does this look like this.

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       But you would have to go and get them and then go, okay, this is isis and this is the internet. And then this was twitter and this is a, this is how they send information through pictures with Metadata, you know, it's encoded in the picture and you have to break it down. And that's where the message is. Like, they'd be like, oh yeah, search everybody that be my God. You live in a terrible place to be. I got to go to bed and really processed this. Like back in the day when we only had muskets, it was so awesome. I don't know if my argument makes sense to you but it, but to me it's, I just feel like these are certain sacred rights that need to be protected in any way they can. And if we want to have a conversation about like, why we should see this right in this specific way, then you have to do it a little more clearly.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       And to me I, I just, I think people take some of these things for granted that, you know, what's stopping them from, you know, if, if these rights continue to erode, then what stops them from busing in your house at some point and be like, well, we all, they can do that. And there, there are some search and seizure methods that they're, they're really being criticized for lately in particular for these, uh, for drug offenses where they just don't even knock. They just break open people's doors and wind up shooting their dogs all the time. Shoot people all the time. I mean there was an article written recently about the amount of people that are wounded in unnecessary, like how do they describe that kind of altercation between the cops? No knock, no search lists. Warrant or what is the. I think they just call it no knock break ins or something like that. I don't. I don't know how to describe it, but if you've seen the way the dea treats any sort of situation, even when they just have marijuana, they'll kick down the door. If they see a dog, they shoot it and then they, they, they make people huddled up in the corner after they just murdered your family pet and oftentimes they find like a pipe.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       You know what I mean? There's many people that had been called a on like someone has turned them in or someone has a said something about them and it turned out to not be true. Like, Hey, these people have a grow up and their business or in their house rather, and one of them was a former FBI, a couple that both worked in the FBI. They kicked in their fucking door, held them at gunpoint, the whole deal. Went to the basement. They were growing tomatoes and they were like, what in the fuck? These are retired FBI officers and the dea broke down their door and pointed a loaded gun in their face and then found plants. Yeah, you can eat that. You can eat, you can eat. We do as they can. It's actually not bad for you. I, uh, I, I, so these things are happening actually.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       That one thing sounds familiar with the family pet being killed. I think I saw a video on that. A lot of it. It's not just one thing, men, one of them was a mayor and um, God dammit. Was it Washington? Where was it? Where was it? There was a mayor who the. It turned out that the post office, someone in the post office was running a scam. And what they were doing was they were having, we'd sent to other people's addresses and they were sending it through the post office and the postman would intercept the package because he was the guy who delivered that out of drugs. So he would get that package and somehow or another it got intercepted before it got to the post man and then they had a dummy post man come and bring it and then do the whole break down the door.

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       Shoot the dog thing. They chased the dog, a golden lab, chased them out in the yard. The dog ran and it was running and hiding and they shot him in front of everybody. It turned out that the guy who was the victim of this and his family who were held at gunpoint and zip tied, it was a mayor and so you know, he was like, what in the fuck are you people doing? Like, what is this? You just killed my dog in front of my kids. You traumatized my family. Yeah, it's awful. But you're making the argument in my opinion of why we have to take a stand, you know, like why we have to say like in this, in that situation, yes, but just not tsa though. No, but it's. But it is a fourth amendment issue that we would that or allow them to be eroding.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       No one should be allowed to go into anyone's home without a warrant no matter what, but don't you think that you sort of imply at least a certain amount of consent when you get in that line and give them your bag and say, here, search this, like no one's telling you that you have to do that. You could choose to fly with no baggage at all. You could choose if you want to send your stuff through the mail and it would probably cost the same amount as it would to pay that 50 bucks or whatever it is with southwest. If you wanted to send your package through the mail, you could do it that way and just walk through with nothing on you. Sure you could do that. Yeah, and you would still have to go through the machines and all that. I don't. I don't dispute that because I agree with you in the pre nine slash 11 world.

Speaker 3:          00:35:16       I'm going through the metal detector. Having your bags and you're looking at it through the machine. I think that that's all reasonable. I just don't like the people being pulled aside. Pulled in the rooms, people just going through the kind of very disrespectfully going through shit and I don't know how to connect to me. I have, I, I just. Is that, is that a hill worth dying on? In a way? It is because I feel like it could just as you made the point, it's already see that mentality now seeps into of different places. Right? And I just don't want to see what the. I don't want to see the end result of that. You know, that mentality is also the justification for the NSA. Being able to look at your text messages or being able to look at your emails and that's the big thing that was exposed by Edward Snowden.

Speaker 3:          00:35:48       That really pissed me off that so many people are so flippant about. They were like, Hey, if you're not doing anything wrong, don't worry about it. Like that is wrong. You can't say that because you can't look at everyone. You can't just randomly look at everyone and look at their private information. You just can't do that because the people that are looking at that are just people. And that's the problem with the TSA. It's not even necessarily the issue being that you get to search people stuff to make sure there's no terrorists and no people bringing weapons on a planet. It's who gets to do that. Who are these people? Are these people experts or these people's security experts? Are they, are they work for the massage? You know, are they, uh, are they CIA agents or they FBI? Are they, who's looking? Who these people are they competent?

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       Why are they doing when you go to the airport, man, you see what you see is a bunch of people. And I used to joke about this, that I think that phrase, this making sound less insulting than it used to be the old joke. But the idea was that I think that the people that work at Burger King at the airport and the TSA, they're the same people and they just reach into a hat today. I got fries. Oh Shit, I'm on duty. It's literally almost like that. It's like you see people that are just taking whatever job they can get ahold of, you know, I feel for them. I mean if someone comes along and you don't have a job and they say, hey, the Tsa Siren, 15 bucks an hour. Okay, cool. What I gotta do you gotta stand here and make sure that people don't bring water bottles on a plane.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       All right. And then after like the 50th day, if people bring them in, take your fucking water bottle out of the bag. No, you're doing. Yeah. My, my frustration grows in that way, which is people that in 2017 seemed to have some because you and I, I'm sure you do too. I fly all the time. Right. So you, you see all types. Right. And it's like you always encountered the guys like have you not flown in the last 15 years ever to know that people try to walk through the machines with their shoes on their belt. It's like what is the time? And then the convenience get people that don't push their bins through the, you know, down to the thing and just leave it there for someone else to push through. Like what is going on? People are just couldn't. There was this one guy was really kind of funny, he was going through the metal detector thing and he had a bottle of water in his bag and because he had a bottle of water in his bag there to check his bag.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       And so, um, when he goes through, they set your bag aside, you know, your thing goes through line that hits the scanner and they said they pull it back check. So this guy was like checking his phone and look at the bag check. I mean like 30 seconds had gone by and he goes, I have a flight to catch, excuse me, excuse me, I have a flight to catch. And the woman who grabbed his back, he said, what are the odds? You're at an airport and you got a flight to catch how crazy. And she goes, hey, you got a water bottle in your bag, dummy. And she pulled in. Everybody was laughing. It was funny because the guy was being a con and the girl just kind of called them out on it. And the way she did it was very humorous. I got a good chuckle out of it. Yeah, that's good. I mean, yeah, you see, I always try to show it to your point about showing some respect to the TSA agents. I have my confrontations

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       with them somewhat. Do you, what kind of conversations that you had? Well, just in the sense that like just a a couple of weeks ago, I guess it was when I came down to see Dave, I was with my girlfriend and they were going through. They were going through a bag. They held my girlfriend's bag but they were just holding it for like two point four minutes. We weren't in a rush, but I'm like, the guy wasn't even acknowledging that. Like, hey dude, our stuff's here. Like we're kind of just standing here waiting. And I'm like. And I said to him like, are you enjoying your little bit of power right now? Like, I don't understand what, what you're doing this to us. We said please and thank you were doing like doing our stuff. So just these little confrontations. I had a massive, when I was in, when I was installing highschool because 9:11 happened when I was in twelfth grade and I flew down to uh, uh, in 2000, two, early 2002, I flew down to Virginia to see my sister who was teaching down there and um, I, they were going through my stuff, my bags and stuff like that and I had a confrontation with the TSA.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       Were there, some of them, one of them was like, son, do you know what happened or whatever, you know. And I'm like, yeah, I know what happened. I'm from New York, I live in new, heard of [inaudible] and my dad's in New York City. Firefighter. Yeah, I understand what happened, you know, and like to the point where like where they called over, like I was a 17 year old kid and they're to the point where they called over like some cops and then they just let me go whatever. But I was like, at that point it was sold in me where I'm like, why are you being so why are you disrespecting me? Like you're going through my stuff. If I'm a little upset about that or I have something to say about that, like I understand you have to probably deal with this all day, but don't, don't because I'm a young kid.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       I don't know what happened because I'm a young man. I, you had no idea what my experience was. Were you at the funeral for a firefighter that you knew that died? You know, I was so like, you know, it's, it's that kind of stuff always. I think it's so to seed in me very early with them. Where am I? So I, I acknowledged that part of it too, where it's like there is a little bit of a chip on my shoulder with them. I'm sure that is. I never have a confrontation with them. I'm always super friendly, uh, go through say hi to people. I just, I just treated it as like, just, this is what I'm doing now. I don't say this is a big inconvenience. I just say, this is what you have to do. This is what I'm doing now. I do respect this idea that the fourth amendment is being violated, but I do not see a better alternative.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       If I did, I would think that what we should definitely follow that protocol, whatever the better alternative is. I just think whenever you have non skilled labor in those sorts of situations, like the guy working the fries at Burger King or the guy who's, you know, doing that thing at the Tsa, you're going to get a wide variety of people that need a job. Right? And some of them are just going to suck at protocol. They're going to suck at being polite. They're gonna suck it. Recognizing that this old. I don't think they have any leeway either. If some old lady comes through in a wheelchair, I'm pretty sure you have to check her just like you check everybody else and if you don't you'll probably get fired. They have cameras and watching them everywhere. So it's not their fault. The organization itself, the Tsa, I mean there's a diffusion of responsibility when you're in one of the people that's responsible, you're at the top and you make these, these laws and then you pass them down to the people that are supposed to enforce all these regulations that you, you know, you've, you've written down.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       There's almost like this is a diffusion of responsibility from the people that have created those. They don't have to enforce them. They're not. They're doing it so

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       someone else, it's someone else's job, the $10 an hour guy, it's his job to go out there and do all this stuff and so it's real easy for someone at the top who's not experiencing the interaction, the day to day interaction with these human beings to be callous about it or to make like hard, fast rules like, hey, if someone comes through in a wheelchair, there's no leeway, let them go. But then again, you have to think about it and their point of view. Like if someone was a terrorist and they did decide, well, here's what we do. I mean, they've been proven for a fact. They've used children as suicide bombers, so why wouldn't you use an old lady? You know? Why wouldn't you use an old man? Why don't you use someone in a wheelchair? You certainly could. So you have to follow the same protocol with everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       Everybody that goes through has to be scanned. You can't let someone need not be scanned just because they're old. Like you've reached a certain amount of years on this planet. You wouldn't do anything fucking crazy would you, bob, you know? No, not me. You know, you, you, you, you can't think like that. Because if you do think like that, that will be your vulnerability. That will be the path in that someone is looking to do something horrible will, will take. I think that the. I think the solution drove to bridge the gap in the way we feel about this and come to some sort of consensus what might be in this conflict. A little with my small government kind of mentality, but it's just to say like, to ask the kind of fundamental question, why are these people being paid 10 or $15 an hour back to the Israeli experience with these guys that are professionals there.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       They take a lot of pride in their work. They make maybe 80,000, $100,000 a year and they, you know, not that they necessarily need to make that much money, but people that are professional, should we invest more money and making the smarter, you know, it would be a substantial increase in our airline fees and other things I'm sure. Sure. Maybe it wouldn't. Maybe going, well we already pay a little bit of that but with tickets, but I think homeland security might be able to. Maybe we stopped dropping bombs on a bunch of countries and take some of that money and put it on and put it on, you know, into that area. What else you suggest no more drones. Fucking communists. Who is this guy? Um, yeah. I mean, the Israeli thing is interesting because Israel has a mandatory military service requirement that I am not in favor for favor of, but I am a part of me.

Speaker 3:          00:43:36       I feel, I feel the benefit of it like you've, it's very rare to meet people that are more patriotic than Israelis, you know, people that are more, uh, more committed to their country. It's like a very, I mean, they feel very marginalized, very targeted and rightly so. And so because of that, like the people that I've met that work for the Israeli army or that have been, uh, soldiers over there, they have this very intense sort of a view of altercation and of the world. And when you're forced to do two years of military service mandatory like they are, you also have, you're invested in this whole project of Israel. I mean there's no, there's no veterans and civilians. Everyone's a fucking veteran and you know, when you deal with a country where it literally everyone does some military service. There's everybody's, there's more chips in the game, you know, people are all in different, different scenario. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       I think I went to school with this girl that was Israeli when I was at northeastern and Boston and uh, I remember very clearly she had this very unassuming you would never know, but she had this picture of her with an assault rifle shooting at a range. And I'm like, this is so, so interesting. It conflicts because I agree with you. It's like one of those things where I'm like, I don't, I can see both sides of this where um, I don't know that the state should have the right to exert that kind of power over a person, but at the same time does it have to be military service? And when a person turns 18, is it fair to say like, just spend a couple of years and give something to your country and whether it's you, you, you work in a soup kitchen or something or you do something that is for the society and really have some, some investment in some skin in the game in society. I think that that's a nice idea, but I think that the way I feel about the state's exertion of power over the individual kind of overrides that, but I like, I like the idea in principle, like the idea of saying like, hey, and it's also easy for me is a 32 year old. That would be long, you know, it'd be like, yeah, you guys do it. So at the same time, I understand that argument as well.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       No, I think I'm completely in agreement with you. I love the idea that they're all in, but I don't want anybody in forcing that on me and I want. I want a kid. If a kid grows up in America and then decides, Hey man, I'm going to backpack across the country now. You can't. You got to join the army. You fuck, I don't want that. You know, I want. I want people to be doing whatever the fuck they want. Hey, I want to be a, a fly fishing guide in Colorado. No, you can't. You have to clean machine guns, right? No. Fuck that. I love the fact that America has so much ultimate freedom for like what you choose to do and not to do. Look, we live in this sort of a experiment in self government and you can not participate if you want to. I liked that. I'd like to. You don't have to vote. I mean, I'm not saying that everybody should fuck off and not vote, but I am saying that I liked that it's your option. Me Too. I think they have compulsory voting in Australia, I want to say, and they'll tell that works out. Fucking kangaroos everywhere. Crocodiles, spider is poisonous. Bugs and shit. Got The place. Looks horrifying. But the, uh, no, I've never been either been. I lived there. That's number three on my list yet we're number one. America, number two, Canada, number three, Australia.

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       That seems like a pretty reasonable. Let's, I mean I could list just being in the gaming industry. I know a lot of people, some people I really love that came from Australia, really friendly people, but the interior, that country sounds like a just an absolute fucking shit show. It's crazy, but

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       it's also really gorgeous. It's wild. Uh, I have a good buddy who lives over there who goes into the interior all the time and he, uh, he's the one who sent me a video of a brown snake getting killed by some evil spider. There's some brown snake kills you instantly and there's some evil spider that was killing the brown snake. I'm like, what the fuck? Kind of a shit hole. Do you live in Adam? He's, he's a madman. He's out there living in that shit. A man like me would not be able to survive their camps out there. He goes out into the Bush and shoots buffalo's a bow and arrow. He's and he's a maniac, but the area of, uh, Australia is the size of the continental United States, but there's as many people as less than the amount of people

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       that live in the greater Los Angeles area live in the entire. This whole fucking continent of Australia. It's nuts. That's incredible. Yeah. It's like Perth on the, on the west coast, and then it's just the Sydney and Melbourne, right on the east coast. And that's basically cleans Queensland, Queensland. There's a few other places, but the bottom line is there's a giant percentage of that place where you don't want to get caught dead. No, no, I, I wouldn't. I'm the kind of guy with like where I see a spider and I have to argue with my girlfriend who is going to kill it. So I don't, I don't want to. I don't want to be really. Yeah, I hear you. We step up. It's always, it's always, it always ends up on me, but I hate. I hate, I hate spiders. So, so if I see even these little, I hate them.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       Do you get a rack in a phobia? Do you know? I don't think I have that. I'm not going to like, if I see one calling me, I'm not going to run out the house, but I'm like, oh, I don't want to. Is this thing in a job I have to like really think about my strategy on how I'm going to kill this thing. It's one of those things where I'm like, so if I was in Austria, I'm just being honest with you. So I was in Australia, you know, that'd be super careful in Australia. Oh my God, Dude. I see some of these things when people were outside barbecuing, even in Melbourne or something like that, and the camera pans the. It's a brown snake. And I'm like, holy Jesus, God, I wouldn't. I don't know. The waters are filled with sharks. If you get past the sharks, they're filled with jelly fish.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       You get to the shore is poisonous spiders. You go into the hills. Is Poisons fucking snake. What is it about that part of the world? They're like ruthless unbelieved. Yeah, they were the man of war and all that kind of stuff in the water and, and, and the, the box jellyfish or the scariest can kill you. They kill you if you fall into some sort of a patch or what do they call them? A school of Jellyfish. If you accidentally stumble upon one, you're a dead person. You're fucked. I mean, they just, you're dead instantly. That's really crazy. They're a little tiny guys, right? To someone that's warm on you in their heart. They're jellyfish are always scary because growing up on long island we had obviously harmless jellyfish, but they would wash up on the shore sometimes and I used to look at them.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       I was kind of like, well, these are so strange. What is this, Jamie? A spider. Killing a brown snake. Another one, so spiders just eat ground snakes all the time. He's according that the weapons for cool fine webs are awesome. It's horrifying. Not, not to me. Snakes or cons. I don't know whose team I'm on. I think I'm on team snake more than I am on a team sport. I think I am too, just because they're less scary to me. Plus, well you can eat spiders. Apparently tarantulas are delicious and they cook them a lot. In the Amazon they have these big spiders that they cook and there are a lot like crabs. They taste like crabs and apparently they're really similar in their lineage or genetic. Interesting. Yeah, I mean if you put a piece of. If you put a spider and from it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       I didn't know what it was. I'd be fine. I know. Even if I didn't know what it was, if you know it's not gonna kill you when it's dead. So yeah, if it's good, if it's good, if it's delectable, that's why I shouldn't say I've eaten spiders before on fear factor. I have eaten a couple of spiders. I eat a cave African cave dwelling. Spider. Jamie just freaked out. You must have seen some things on that show, man. I'm like, yeah, I'm. I'm pretty numb. Yeah, I guess that explains a lot of your kind of more. You've seen it all like an old prostitute. I've seen too much, you know. No 50 year

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       old prostitute in Holland. Like whatever smoking a cigarette you can show her do to me that lipstick on my teeth. I'm not even bothered to clean it off. I'm, I'm curious about, because you brought it up before, but what is your stance on Snowden? Uh, it seems like you're against the NSA and all that kinda stuff, but what is your stance on him? Like I'm curious. Like what do you think he should come back? Do you think that he is a patriot? I think he's more of a Patriot than he is a trader. I agree, but I think it's a very complex issue when you give away national secrets and your you have signed an oath that you're not going to give away national secrets. You sign an oath of secrecy and then you give away national secrets, but if those national secrets are in the case of Edward Snowden, they're very detrimental to what we think of as freedom in this country.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       Like if you have a bunch of people like you or me or Jamie or it just a normal person and they work at the NSA and they can, as he said, he said, spy on their ex girlfriend's read their emails, go into anybody's email that you want to check, check them out, and then we were also being lied to by the government about the extent of these searches and he exposed that that the president was saying it's just metadata and he was saying, no, it's not just metadata. It's not. It's the actual emails is the actual text messages. See actual photos that you're sending to each other. They can get those. They have all of those and that they're storing all this stuff. People were horrified, but this is also something that was exposed. There was an NSA whistleblower from boom, I want to say 2011.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       There was a guy who was a, I think he was a coder and the NSA, and he's gone public with this, but he didn't go public with this in the same way where he dumped a bunch of documents and and let people go through them like Edward Snowden did. And he also didn't face the consequences that Edward Snowden did as well. He didn't really. He was criticized and you know, it was debated whether or not him talking about it at all was legal or whether it should be able to, but ultimately he didn't face the same kind of consequences. Mean Edward Snowden can't live in America anymore. I mean, Chelsea manning has been exonerated or what would have been pardoned. Pardon? Yeah. Is that the word wasn't a partner when you did commuter to sentence commuted the sentence. Right. So the commute the sentence, and she's allowed to be free in May, so in a couple months she'll be free, but he's stuck in Russia and he essentially the difference being, they said that Chelsea manning went to like went through the court system was tried and then Obama decided that it was a good enough amount of time and then he was going to commute the sentence.

Speaker 3:          00:53:00       So I kind of see their point there that Edward snowden fleed and didn't go through the whole but. But why wouldn't he flee? You're going to lock them in a fucking cage. Chelsea manning was locked in a cage 24 hours a day with the lights on, with no fucking clothes in solitary confinement. Confinement for, I don't know how long, but it was a long period of time. I want to say years, I want to say how long was find out? How long was Chelsea manning in solitary confinement for? Because I know the way they did it, it was cold in there and they took away all her clothes or it was his clothes. At the time was he, was he. And when did you. When did you start saying him or her a deal with that? Yeah, I don't. I think at the All Africa point when you're thinking back on the person before they transitioned, like do you say that Bruce Jenner won the Olympics, so do you say the Caitlyn Jenner won the Olympics?

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       Jesus, I don't know another way to say the wrong thing. Okay. The former army analysts with two weeks of solitary confinement connection with the suicide attempt in July. No, no, no. That's just one. The declined to discipline them with two weeks now, but she's been in solitary confinement, not just over the suicide attempt. This is. This is like way late. That's 2016 go. I'm not. Not the solitary confinement after suicide attempt, but just go to solitary confinement and don't look at Chelsea, look at Bradley manning solitary confinement. It was before he was tried. Yeah, it was like you could say he say he can you get yelled at? I bet you could. I'm sure you will for say he, but I think it's reasonable to say before the transition when you went back and posterity on on a person. Maybe it's up to that person, but I would assume that the Pronoun would change at that point.

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       Give a fuck. It's ridiculous. Confusing. It's so stupid. There was a. There was a case of A. I'm a transgender fighter who was a man for 30 years. Became a woman for two years and started beating the fuck out of these women and didn't tell them by the way. Oh, so they didn't. So the organizers or whatever it didn't. He didn't tell us she whatever, didn't tell the people that she was fighting, but here's the best part about it. I was debating with someone online and this woman said that she's always been a woman, that this person has always been a woman. And I said, okay, do you realize that this person fathered a child? I said, so even when he was a man having sex with a woman and got her pregnant, he was a. He was a woman then and this woman goes, even then I'm like, okay, we're done.

Speaker 3:          00:55:20       We'll fuck. That doesn't make sense. I owe 23 hours a day for over an 11 month period. Shit and conditions that he also found might have constituted tortured, tortured Juan Mendez has completed a 14 month investigation and the treatment of manning since the soldiers arrested US military base in May of 2010. He concludes the US military was at least culpable of cruel and inhumane treatment and keeping manning locked up alone for 23 hours a day for an over an 11 month period in conditions that he found. Okay. So yeah, that was, that was what it was. It was, it was almost a year of solitary confinement and I'm pretty sure that he, at the time she now was naked and um, they took everything away from him. No books, no nothing. So it's really nothing to read. Nothing cold. They keep it cold to keep it cold where you're like barely able to tolerate it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       Holy Shit. What do you do? Like what is your, what is your, what are the places your mind goes? I would start doing Kung Fu. Yeah. I'll just start. Just start working on it. I'd be like Wesley Snipes in that one movie where they kept him locked up, I think stripped naked at night. Yeah. I think that, you know, what, what they did was what they are allowed to do. You know, you're allowed to do whatever you want to do when you get someone locked up like that. They don't really have the kind of rights that are around an average person does. You get locked up for treason and there was a tremendous amount of heat coming towards the US military when that wiki leaks video. Um, uh, what was the, what was it called? What did they call it? Something about collateral murder. I think that was what they call it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       Was it? Was it, was it drones or was it. No, it was a helicopter. Oh, I know. Okay. I know you talked about. Yep. Helicopter shooting. Fucking horrific gunfire down on these people. That turned out to be reporters. And then the callous attitude that these soldiers showed in the video, we can hear them talking about whether or not there are kids in the van. Well, they shouldn't have brought kids. Like the whole thing was like really dark and I think in a lot of ways exposure to that stuff is good because unchecked behavior is extremely dangerous. That seemed like it was unchecked and it seemed like unchecked behavior in a time of war is extremely dangerous and it was pretty obvious that when you looked at what at Edward Snowden had revealed, it was pretty obvious that the majority of the American people had a huge problem with it. The majority of the American people, you or I who are doing nothing wrong. I'm not committing any crimes. I'm not. I'm certainly not victimizing anybody. Why do they have access to my email? Why? There's no reason, no reason. You just can like that. That seems insane and that to me is a way clear violation of the fourth amendment. Then this weird sort of gray area. Not necessarily great if you're looking at it from a constitutional sense of how they're allowed to check you out.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       Yeah. No, that's great. That's a very valid and solid argument. I think because my, my stance on manning specifically as soften, soften overtime because I feel like, um, you know, when he or she can we call her Z, Z. I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I just don't know. What else was he in? Disrespectful. You fucking son of a bitch. Sorry. Racist too. I know, I know. That's what that Lexis nexis will call me a racist for the rest of my life. Um, but uh, yeah. To me it was like, I felt like it was, it was very. They didn't take the time to, to people died because of that stuff like there, there are people that were put in danger because of the things that they were put out because it wasn't, they didn't carefully comb through it and make sure that he's actually done.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Yeah. Yeah. I mean you could look, I don't think that they look that, look that up and say it's because of the way wikileaks released it yet because I don't think that. I don't know if they're going to point that specific things, but the, the way things were out there, like I don't think all of the names were blacked out. I don't think like the operate the operations and process, like people were in play, you know, that we're being out at in that way. I think the reason I was a little softer on snowden was because not only was it domestic primarily, but which I think is an important qualifier, but also because I think he went out of his way to not single any individuals out. It was all about the apparatus itself. It wasn't about like saying like General Blah Blah, blah is doing this general or admiral,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       but it was about like, Hey, this structure exists and it's really as quite nefarious indeed. You know? And I think that. So I was always to me my stance on him as he's a patriot and you should be welcomed home and the fact that he wasn't. He can't be, I guess party hasn't been tried or whatever. But the fact that I know that some people think that Obama only pardoned manning because it made him look good with the transgender community and with the Lbgtq community, which I think is a little. There might be a living office though. Well, because it's part of his legacy. Like it's part of what I'm saying. Like, you know, it's the same reason why you know, how much Ford was hurt when he pardoned Nixon that stuck with them forever and a negative way. Well, this is going to stick with Obama, I think positively in a good way of moving forward.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       But I don't know that I'm, I'm not, I'm quite that callous and thinking that that's the only reason. I think that he probably had time to marinate on it. Clearly she went through some rigorous. Well, also what's important to point out is that Obama's website, the hope and change website that he had when he was running for president and when he got into office, the original website had in it, these provisions for how he was going to treat whistleblowers with, with, uh, they were gonna allow people to release information that showed crimes and they were going to protect them. They're going to protect whistleblowers. It was a very specific statement, was a very specific approach that they were having while he was running for president about whistleblowers because he was about exposing these agregious offenses and when, once he got into office, one of the things that happened after the Chelsea manning thing and after the Edward Snowden things, they removed that from the hope and change website.

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       The removed that provision about whistleblowers. Interesting. Because it's obviously, it was obviously it was, he was unable. He's either a hypocrite or is unable to keep that promise. Right. Well, that goes back to the whole thing with snowden. When you're saying, well you kind of take an oath to protect these secrets and all that kind of stuff, but I look at it, you know, I don't want people to be flippant with that kind of stuff that you were saying. I want people to be flippantly being like, well this is, I have some sort of personal problem with this, but I actually think it takes a level of courage to be like, what in the fuck is going on here? Oh, for sure. And also I believe that before he gave that information to Glenn Greenwald, I believe he offered it to a bunch of different mainstream news sources like New York Times, Washington Post.

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       I've correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie. I think that was in the documentary, the, the um, I didn't see it or something like that. You fell asleep, tried to watch it in a hotel room. What's up? Just say which one do you want me to look up because I got the. It's a no, no one died as a result of which one? Which one? The one earlier about Chelsea manning. Jamie does it. It doesn't say anything about that was, I remember that being contentious that they, they were saying the reason that they were upset about it was because they were like, this puts people that are in play in danger. Now. Maybe that maybe that may be dangerous, but maybe no one actually does good. The writer had a, a usa today piece, I think about it and she got a lot of heat for pope, for even writing that up in the first place. That puts people in danger that people died from the result of his leaks. Okay. So she got a lot of heat because they haven't. Oh, interest is probably what it is. You probably read that. Okay. Yeah man. People again, you're a racist and

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       people have died. I mean Google says it but, but you know what I'm saying? I mean like, people need clickbait. So with her writing an article saying that bunch of people died or someone died. It's this kind of the same thing. They're trying to make something jucier sure. I'd go and even with the London terrorist attack, uh, you know, recent one. Yeah. The one that just happened where people they've seen too, I've identified the person, get new sources that were that what you think are reputable, say it and then they have to retract it later. Everyone's. Everyone's very quick to try to pull the pull the gun first and be like, well, we have. We have the story. Yeah, we're all victimized. As you know, people that are just, you know, we're not in the trenches, so we need the information. We have to trust these people and trust is broken.

Speaker 3:          01:02:57       I think in a Lola and I certainly think there should be some sort of a national debate on whether or not Edward Snowden is a hero. You know, whether or not Edward Snowden did something that benefited the American people because I certainly think the overall reaction, the overall, like if you look at what Edward Snowden did and then you look at what are the consequences of what he did. I think it's good for us because we got to see that all these Alex Jones type conspiracies were actually true when Alex Jones is ranting and raving about the government living in your emails. One of the great episodes of the show, by the way, I love it, but people were looking into that like there's no fucking way. There's no way that government really looks into your email. There's no way it doesn't happen, but yes they do. Like that was.

Speaker 3:          01:03:38       That was a stunner to me and this for me was I'd been telling people that Alex Jones, who's my friend and has been my friend for a long time and I get criticized so much by people that they're like, he's so crazy and he's such a fucking right wing Wacko. I'm like, Alex Jones is not right wing. He's not. He's antigovernment. He's anti tyranny and, and he might be crazy as fuck and he probably is, but he's right about a lot of shit and that's where it gets really scary. So he's. He was talking about the NSA, looking into people's emails and having the ability to, like I found out about that NSA whistleblower, the original one. See if you could find who that guy is. I want to say yes, yes. Pull it, pull it, pull up that article. I found out about that from Alex.

Speaker 3:          01:04:20       he told me about it. I'm like, what? And then I hear Bill Binney, the original NSA whistleblower on in nine slash 11 and illegal surveillance. Now. He was a god, I want to say it was before nine slash 11, wasn't it? Before nine slash 11. Then he came out with this scroll down. Oh, was it right after nine slash 11. He believes that nine slash 11 was preventable. A month after it happened. He resigned in protest from the National Security Agency bidding was part of an elite NSA team that was, which, uh, designed and built an intelligence gathering system to target and collect data on terrorism threats. He belongs to an intimate group of, of, for whistleblowers, each of whom left the NSA after raising concerns about failures and the agencies. Intelligence gathering capabilities. Yeah. So he's a. He was the first guy that was saying what they're doing is bullshit. And he alleges the NSA buried key intelligence that could have prevented nine slash 11. He alleges the agency's bulk data collection from Internet and telephone

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       communications is unconstitutional and illegal in the U. s he alleges that the NSA is ineffective at preventing terrorism because analysts are too swamped with information on. That makes sense. I'm under its bulk collection program. That totally makes sense. Yeah. When you're. When you have everything, what do you. Where do you begin? Yeah, I mean all those things that he's. I mean, that's. There's no way. I mean that's the thing. Like a friend of mine, I was joking around about this because managers, I'm just not comfortable with the NSA reading my email. I go, of course you're not comfortable. I'm not either. But guess what, who's fucking reading your shit man? Nobody's reading your shit. No, that's not even the point. Right? Well, it goes back to the point you were making because with the Patriot Act after 9:11, they made the same argument. Well, if you have nothing to hide, right.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       But the problem is, is soon as something comes up, like they go, hmm, this column, Moriarty, he's been talking to a lot of shit. Let's find out what he's into, but I'll look at that. A bunch of Dick Pics, right? Right. Time to put those all in one that. Hey Bro, nothing wrong. We take pictures. Uh, but uh, yeah, no, I, I think I kind of, I think we're in the lead with that. I think snowden is a hero. Uh, I, I feel like what he did took a lot of courage. Uh, and, and, and it blow up his life. I would like to, if I go to Russia and uh, I might go to Russia for the UFC. I'd like to meet that dude. I'll let you interview him. He probably would talk to you. Jamie, you want to go to Russia?

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       Big Pause. We'll talk about data when I was younger and I was trying to think of like, I don't want to put an next by him. I don't want to put you on the spot, but if it was possible to meet that guy, I would love to meet that guy. I don't know if they just let you meet them though. I bet it would be like really hard. I know John Oliver met him. Shane Smith did too. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Maybe I'd go with Shane. Shane Hook it up. You would probably love to talk to you. I mean he, he, he seems like an interesting. He's probably caught on a contract, constant surveillance you have to assume, but I'm sure I would be fucked when I came back. They probably check everything. Oh my God. Yeah. I would like to sit down with that guy for a few hours, like a do like a six hour interview with him and just pick them apart and ask like, what is your life like now man?

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       Like how many brushing chicks you banging your here over here pay you. What do you, how do you eat? What do you do to feed yourself? Like where's he getting these money? He must got a stipend of some sort. You have to assume, right? I mean you have to. I mean he's a guest of there so you have to assume that he's taken care of in some way. Right. But I mean he probably has to keep his value high, like at a certain point in time, like they, they, they could say hey, you're not valuable to us anymore time to live in Guatemala, bitch. He, I mean, he's a very smart man, so he must know at the highest level that he is a geopolitical pawn that, like you said, could be played in any way at any point. You know, it was him. I would just be listening to Rosetta stone with Russia all day long.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       I'll be like, I need to find out how to speak Russian and I need to fucking go hide in Siberia or something and to grow my beard out. Yeah. He's, he's an interesting cat. Like I, I, I'm, I'm somewhat fascinated by him. I don't think we've, I think you'll come back at some point that Neil degrasse Tyson had a fascinating interview with him on startalk radio where I was in Neil degrasse Tyson. Essentially we're the same thing that he thinks he's a patriot, you know, uh, Neil doesn't really take too many stances like that are really political in that regard. But I think as far as like data collection or random of just a blanket data collection of all the people in the United States, I think it's fucked. And it's absolutely not what we think of when we think of the freedom that the United States supposedly provides its citizens.

Speaker 1:          01:08:39       It seems like we're all under suspicion then we're all being under surveillance. That's some really creepy orwell type shit, you know, that's just not what we want. It's extremely Orwellian. And I, it goes, I feel like with Snowden, sometimes people miss the forest for the trees with it. They're very focused on the man in the act, but they're not focused on, you know, one of the things that I'm really interested in is like, what is the complicity? Well, what is the level of complicity with the telecoms? Like what is the complicity with the government like forcing these people and, and, and there's a whole and how many thousands of people are in on this? And that's the whole, that's the crazy thing is that snowden, who was a contractor, not even really in the inner sanctum of the NSA, knew all of this stuff. There are people running around thousands of people just acting like this never happened or wasn't going on.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       So it's a pretty, it's not a conspiracy because we know it's true, but it's a pretty big thing where I'm like focusing on Snowden is missing the entire point. There's like, why are all like why didn't no one like no sprint or t mobile? Anyone was like, Hey, well you imagine the kind of cool would have been for one of those companies would be like we're not doing this. And in fact like we're going to tell everyone, you know, like, what will this will make us look amazing, you know, from a very shrewd corporate stance and be like, well we don't grow. Let's be honest. I would never happen. And if it did happen they would come down on that company so hard. There has to be some weird sort of arrangements of these gigantic telecommunication companies like verizon or something has with the federal government and we just has to be.

Speaker 1:          01:10:01       I think it's just protecting the bottom. I mean I'm sure that there's something they can do, but they don't care about anything but money. So I have a friend who used to be a big executive at Google and she described to me some of the conversations that they had when they were dealing with the government and search engines and being able to access people's search engine results. And then also with China, like how when Google went over to China, like there was very specific things they had to agree to what the government in order to make sure that they were there, they had to restrict the searches. They had to. They had to censor things. I mean the government of China does not feel the same way about freedom as the government. The United States and the government of the United States gets real sketchy with it. W, as soon as you're doing what Edward Snowden has proven that they're doing, you're getting really sketchy with freedom. I mean you can land of the free home of the brave. Except I want to look at your Dick Pics, except I want to read your emails to one, to listen to your voicemails, except I want to be able to track your calls. I accept. I want to be able to know where your phone is at all times. I mean, that metadata from where the location of your phone is, is one of the primary ways they target terrorists. I mean, the people who are not aware of why so many civilians die and these terrorist

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       attacks, the part of the reason, especially in the early days of drone attacks, um, uh, when they were trying to target terrorists rather would, was that they would use the metadata. They would find out where the phones are. So if your phone was in this apartment building, they're going to bomb that apartment building.

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       It's like, whoa. Yeah, it's, it's very deep. It's very technical and I have no problem with them going to a shadow court and, and getting like a permission to be like, we're tracking this guy's full right now. We're, we're reading this guy or this organization's emails or people that are kind of within seven degrees of separation or whatever from this person there. At least there's some sort of orderly nature to it. Right? Like, you don't need to be reading my emails or my, My, you know, I'm just getting uber receipt, sent them an email where it's like, what, why are you even storing all this? And I'm like, what is, what use is it other than the, obviously they want friends, they want data that they can big high updata a eagle eye data and saying like this is the trend and all these kinds of things.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       But it's all elba gotten because it's like it's not it, it's not right. And that was the disappointing them and you probably feel the same way. Joe is like after snowden and the NSA was a big store, but then everyone kind of just like, oh yeah. And everyone kind of forgot, well they're still kind of doing a lot of the same kind of thing. We didn't, they didn't affect the way we know about it now, but we didn't. We don't know that the level of change that was affected really. And, and, and to me, I feel like this is the thing where you got to keep the pedal down and you've got to keep going and be like, this is not okay, this is not right. Uh, and, and uh, it's the same thing with um, w with the Patriot Act back in the day where everyone was really upset about that. We have every right to be upset about. That's really egregious stuff. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       A mean, the NDA, what they've essentially done is they've eliminated the right of due process. They can lock you up for as long as they want. They can deny you any sort of a legal representation. That's, that's, that's all been taken away from us. Now. What used to be one of the foundations of being an American, the right to due process, right to have a lawyer, the right to a trial of your own peers. All that stuff has kind of gone. Now. They just decide that you're a terrorist and they could decide you're a terrorist if you spell, if you, if you have weed on you, if you are involved in illegal drugs, you can be under the Patriot Act, considered a terrorist. It's really kind of crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:13:21       It is, and it's. It's scary in the sense too because it goes back to what they were saying or what this gentleman was saying that we were just talking about where he was saying like, oh, they have too much data. They have too much to work with. At some point someone has to be like, Hey, the guy with an ounce of weed or the guy what you know, even with four ounces of weed, why are we dumping him in with all this stuff that's just going to muddy the waters more about the real target that we're really going after, which is someone that's actually going to hurt someone or someone that's actually going to cause a terrorist incident. To me, I would, if I were them, I'd be like, we need less. We need way more targeted data. We need to leave 325 million people alone, probably

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       pay the least, and here's another big part of the problem was that when Obama was instituting these changes and when the NDA got passed and when people were saying, well, hey, we're never going to use it. This is one of the things that they said, we're never going to hold people without legal representation, and definitely they were going to use the indefinite detainment. Okay, but that's you. What if a crazy person becomes president cut to president trump, we now have a crazy person, crazy person who's now president, and you're like, well, now what? Well, what about these fucking crazy laws, Obama that you pass when he thought that it would be nothing but your standard politicians and hopefully Democrats from now to the end of time. Guess what? Now it's not now it's a guy who wants to dismantle the environmental protection agency. Now it's a guy wants to drill pipelines through. The Dakota access is a guy that wants to do a lot of stuff that people find to be troubling and this guy has the same rights to use. The Nda as you did and he's the new guy and he's kinda crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:14:55       Yeah. And, and that, this is the level of restraint that needs to be shown by someone in that position because

Speaker 3:          01:14:59       he hasn't done anything yet. I mean, you can't say he has used it, but he's only been an officer a couple months.

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       Yeah. Given time. Uh, but to me it's like it goes back to the argument of a, of a executive orders. It goes back to the argument of all of these things were, or the filibuster in the Senate, uh, where what's good for the goose is good for the gander. You can't set up these, these rules that are just going to backfire on you and then complain about them later. To me, I think it's a huge mistake. That's why I have a lot of respect for presidents. We haven't had one in a long time that there are more restrained. The presidents at that differ executive power and actually say like maybe the legislature should be dealing with these kinds of things. We need a man like that or someone like that. Who's ever done that? Oh, I mean, back in the, I mean it's been a lot of time, the gilded age of coolidge and heart and those guys, but ever since FDR really the imperial presidency grew in power and all these kinds of things.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       And before you knew it, you had a little canaries in the coal mine with like, I was actually talking to dave about it last night with Eisenhower with the military industrial complex and all these kinds of amazing, wasn't it? Yeah, like an amazing, really. I don't think people realize how insane that is that, that man said that will explain what he said and when he said it. So, uh, Eisenhower was president from a 52 to 60, so we'll typically 50, 30, 61. And uh, he was obviously one of the instrumental generals in the allied assaults on Japan and on, on Nazi Germany. And he saw the influence of the military growing and that in the Cold War and the Nixon era of the Cold War, that we were making bombs to make bombs that we were trying to have conflicts with Korea. Which you tried that. What she did end in the early fifties, and so seeing that, seeing these seeds sown that of perpetual war of perpetual war, that the economy was actually benefiting from Jamie, pull up that speed

Speaker 3:          01:16:37       because it's an amazing speech. It would be nice for people to hear it has a lot of people are not aware of the tone and the way set it and it was when he was leaving off.

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       Sorry if I'm not doing a good job of. No, no, no. You did a great job. Okay. And so and so. He's a man of a military background. Everyone loved Eisenhower like because of what he did in the war and he a two term President Nixon was very popular, but at the end he was like, you gotta watch what's going on over here. I'm telling you, yes, you can trust me. I'm from that world and watch what's happening. It's a speech. Play a Jamie, cool speech.

Speaker 4:          01:17:11       Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States. Good evening, my fellow Americans. We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed for major wars among great nation

Speaker 4:          01:17:31       until the latest of our world conflicts. The United States had no armaments industry, American makers of ploughshares could with time and that required make swords as well, but we can no longer risky emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a Permanent Armand is industry of bash proportion. I to do this. Three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense. Establish now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience, but total influence, economic, political, even spiritual is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend it's grave. Implications are toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society and the councils of government. We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted.

Speaker 4:          01:19:10       Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.

Speaker 2:          01:19:26       Jesus. It's an amazing. At the time that was an amazing speech and it's just prescient like it's because people don't understand and you know, like before World War II, you know, we weren't a built up under a militarized society. We would militarize when we need it to and, and it was really Teddy Roosevelt and all those kinds of guys that started to kind of get a little more bullish and that kind of regard with the Spanish American war and, and the USS Maine and, and that, you know, but the fight over world war one was real. You know, we didn't want to get involved. We got involved very late and people take for granted. Now that we have just massive military and we have this massive power, but then in the 19th century that not that they're, you know, you can't equate them necessarily to the 21st century. We didn't, we weren't going around running rough shot over people and like doing those kinds of things. We were very isolationist. That was kind of the American tradition and to hear that come out of Eisenhower's mouth, especially knowing his experiences in the war and his and his deep knowledge of the military and what was going on in the world. So it's one of the great warnings of all time in American history

Speaker 3:          01:20:25       and it's very wise in his part because he recognized that there is survival systems that are a part of any industry. You know, it's a, there's survival mechanisms that the industry wants to stay alive. If all of a sudden there's peace on earth. This gigantic industry, this multiple billion dollar a year industry. I mean, I don't know how much. It's trillions a year, right? What is the, what's the military budget? Pretty $600,000,000,000 a year. $600, million dollars of new spending. So you know, you have trillions of dollars worth of equipment, Jesus Christ, so that massive amount of money, um, there's so many people that are involved in that and so many jobs that have to be preserved and so much of the industry relies on keeping conflict, active, uh, active. And I think that's what he was trying to warn us about, but it's so interesting about it and evolve citizenry and that people need to be aware of it. And to hear that from the president, you're never going to hear anything remotely as even close to his candidate is that is today?

Speaker 2:          01:21:22       No, absolutely not. And I think that even hearing that from a, you know, just to reiterate like hearing that from Barack Obama for instance, would be strong, right? But hearing that from a ulysses s grant or Zachary Taylor or a guy that served especially the level he served as like that, that meant something to people and it, and, and I think that that's why that saying never went away, but, but under our noses it happened and what he said was going to happen is exactly what happened in the Southeast Asia, in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, he, he called it from a fucking mile away.

Speaker 3:          01:21:54       Well, it wasn't even a mile away because he was living there. I mean, he was in the heat of it in 1960 when he made that speech. You think about the Gulf of Tonkin incident. I mean that's just a few years later, still few years later, they had a false flag that allowed people to get enthusiastic about entering into the Vietnam War. And that's where it all came from.

Speaker 2:          01:22:10       Right. And it's the same, you know, some people say the USS Maine and Spanish American war in 18, 98 was another false flag or something that was, they let happen or something that was blown out of proportion, you know, pardon the pun, because it was about shit blowing up. But yeah, it's one of those, it is a provocation that gets everyone involved. And they had, we had this nemesis. It was good versus evil. We were upset when we saw, I think especially against the Nazis, we saw what the stature of the good versus evil argument and we won. So with the allies. So we, I think we tried to perpetuate that immediately. The Soviets became the evil and then we created our bombs and then they created their bombs and then we just had this, these proxy wars that we were fighting against the Chinese and Korea. And then the Soviets in Vietnam really like all these things that were kind of, you know, everyone knew what was going on.

Speaker 2:          01:22:52       But no, I'm sorry. No, please go on. Just you. I was just gonna say. So I think that when the Soviet, when everything started to get peaceful, I wonder, they call it glasnost and Soviet, Soviet, which is like the idea of a new era like peace and prosperity with the West or whatever in like the late seventies, early eighties, I think that the, the, the Boeings of the world and the, and the Halliburtons of the world were like, Oh shit, you know, and, and, uh, become nineties, but we immediately found new targets and we should be wary of why that happened. You know, I'm not saying that we shouldn't necessarily fight, we have to fight sometimes, but to have this industrialized nature of it, to have this need to lurch from one war to the next quarter, the next quarter, the next war is not what a, a thriving republic does. It's what a dying empire does. Well, it's definitely

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       what an empire that's dependent upon the control or the or rather an industry rather than. It's dependent upon the control that it has currently maintaining it. You need to maintain that, that money. You need to maintain the business. The business of making these machines and of having these contracts, I mean it's a huge industry and like all of these unlimited growth industries, it's very like every business essentially operates under this paradigm of unlimited growth or most businesses do. Most corporations do where they kind of every year they want to make more money and if that's applicable to accompany that makes tanks well every year they want to make more money. They want to make more tanks. We don't need tanks anymore. Well how the fuck you don't. You definitely need to. Oh look what's going on over here in Yemen. Real Shit. You need some tanks, right? Exactly. And that's means team America, world police. It's, it's really crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:24:27       It's scary and it's a scary waste of money too because I don't think that we. I really do feel like we should have the most powerful military in the world. I don't think that there's anything wrong with that. I think you're right. I think a powerful Republican have those kinds of things, but we don't need all of these bases that are legacy basis. Why are we still in Japan? Why are we still in place? They talk some shit and or Godzilla shows up.

Speaker 3:          01:24:45       Trump's proposed height to military spending is bigger than all but two countries. Entire budgets. Well that's because we're America and we're better than everybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       Yeah, I want to say it. That communists shit off my screen. I want to say, I mean this is incredible. I want to say I think this is right that if you split the military spending of the world in thirds, we've. We are responsible for a third of it. 10 countries are responsible for another third of it and then everyone else is responsible for another third of it. We have four and a half percent of the world's population, so this is way out of whack when with with even our needs, like our actual very need to protect ourselves. I think it's just way out of whack. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:25:21       But when you get past those 10 countries that there are other third and then us, that's 11 countries. Everybody else is using coconuts and catapults.

Speaker 2:          01:25:29       That's essentially throwing rocks at each other. So. But there's relative tranquility, like outside of the Middle East and in East Eastern Europe with the Ukraine and Russia, there's general peace to be had in, in these countries that might not spend a lot of money or might not even have a lot of money to spend them on saying I want to live like they do with that I want, I don't want to spend, say I want to live like they do in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or something like that. But I'm saying like, man, you racist. That's already been established by the International Business Times. Uh, but to me, I just look at it. I'm like, we can spend this money wiser and we can have, we can, we can ramp up and have plans to ramp up people forget. And you know, Gm Ford, all these guys were making our armaments. You know, Mitsubishi made the Japanese Zeroes, IBM offshoots of IBM.

Speaker 2:          01:26:09       We're making frigging punch card machines for the Nazis. You know, like people, people, you know, for better or for worse, ramp up and do what they need to do in times of war to make money. And so we could have a plan in place to say like, Hey, if we need to ramp up, it's something bad happens if we need to go overseas or something, if we have to go engage the Russians because they're rolling into the rest of Ukraine for instance, we have the uh, the we can, we can take care of that without having bases all over the world. Well, the problem with that kind of thinking is as soon as you say that, then they realize, wow, there's a lot of money to be had if that is the case. So let's make that the case. And then there's some weird fucking covert sneaky shit going down.

Speaker 2:          01:26:45       And do you have an earring on both ears? They, the other headphones. Irritating. You don't know. I just like to hear whenever I did I do this. Not all the hearings had been in since I was like 18. I just took them out. I'm superstitious. So you're superstitious. Yeah. So I don't like to, you know, not like over overtly superstitious, but I'm afraid to take them out. I'm afraid to do different things. You have a, we the people tattoo on your arm? Yeah, we, the people and then I have franklins association snake on here. So you're like join or die. Wow. So you're like a serious, almost like a fan of politics that way to describe it. Sure. I meant when I went to college, I went to school for American history and I graduated and when I got my job offer in the video game industry, I was about to start my graduate degree at northeastern in American history because I want it to be a professor at the time.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       So my real passion was American history in American politics, but I veered off into a different direction. No, please go ahead. I was just saying, so these are like relics, so I got these when I was like 20, you know. Wow, that's interesting man. That's a, those are unusual tattoos for 20 year old. Yeah. I, I just, you know, I, I love, uh, I'm really interested in the founding generation. I'm really interested in, in their experiences. And the American revolution I think is a fascinating revolution compared to a lot of other revolutions. Primarily because it is, I think it inherently in some ways, conservative revolution, which is not common. These were incredibly rich people fighting. These weren't like poor destitute people. John Hancock had something like 350th of all of the value of the colonies under is under his name. People had everything, the risk and everything to lose, so it's like an interesting, I think, very principled revolution that they fought.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       Although if you read like Howard Zinn or something that they would say that they did it to protect their money, but I'm sure they did, but I'm sure they had other motives as well. Of course, and it's a. it's a sort of an unprecedented thing in human history. I mean it's a really crazy union that we've established over here to see all of these things that threaten what we find so amazing about it. Like the violations of the fourth amendment, all the NSA stuff with Edward Snowden, all these different things that we see that that are huge problems. What they are is also they're. They're weakening the foundation of these ideas that were so amazing when they were first established in 17, 76 and, and uh, to me that's why I think that they're worth protecting and it goes to, it goes into the like is the constitution living or not?

Speaker 2:          01:29:00       Is it, is a strict constructionist or loose constructionists. All those kinds of questions I think are valid, but to me I'm like, we can't, we have this very unique vision into what the founders intended because they were one of the few, I think people, people at that time that were like, we're going to, you know, the federalist papers are incredible if you read them, like we don't have to wonder what they meant. They literally tell you exactly what they meant. So when you go to supreme court cases, I don't know that there are many supreme court cases that don't even reference the federalist papers because it's like, well they said this an article three, section two, but actually in this paper that they wrote anonymously that we know Alexander Hamilton wrote, here's what he said about it. You know. And I think that's interesting stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:29:36       Now, how did this knowledge of politics and how this fascination that you have with the history of the United States, how did this get you in, you know, quote unquote trouble in the video game industry with these people that are predominantly left wing and predominantly progressive? Like quota? I say progressive, but progressive is kind of a dirty word now, but it's coming. There's a difference between liberal and progressive. Well, it would be great if everybody was liberal. If it would be great if everybody was progressive and it'd be great if everybody wanted people to have freedom of choice and freedom to be whoever you want, but that's not really what those things are anymore. Those things are like ideologies. There are these predetermined patterns of behavior that people subscribe to in a very, very rigid way. How, what did you find was an issue when people found out about your extreme understanding and a respect for the history of the United States?

Speaker 2:          01:30:32       Well, they think it's a. primarily they think it was kind of a joke because not not, not a hot hydro, but like you're, you're a clown kind of. Because why? Because I believe in small government, for instance, I believe in low taxation, I believe in the elimination of the income tax and things like this. These are, these are Rad, but I don't actually have like, not all my ideas are radical or even outside of the mainstream. Socially. I'm probably further to the left that many of these people, you know, uh, I think that it goes back to this idea, and this is something Dave Rubin has touched on a lot in this show, which I'm sure you're familiar with, which is this idea that it's really all or nothing, like they don't want to be an ally with someone that might be able to help them in x, Y, and Z if they disagree with people in a, B and c.

Speaker 2:          01:31:07       So they could have had a great ally in me and being like, I've been pro gay marriage forever. I've been pro choice. Uh, you know, uh, um, for the decriminalization of drugs, I'm for the legalization of prostitution. I'm for a lot of these things that are very far to the left socially that we probably could find some agreement on somewhere. And we can work on those things and get those things done together. But because I say also like, Hey, the income tax is predatory and really hurts people. I own a business. I owned a business and I went, I guess I want another one now. And I know that I could have hired another person if taxes weren't so onerous on me. Um, and so I also stand on there and they, they, they're like, this never happened. This stuff that you just said never happened. This left this left wing stuff that we agree on. Never happened because you don't believe in because you have this one thing that we have a problem with

Speaker 3:          01:31:47       about it. But you're not being clear about that. Like, what, what is the issue? Um, I wanted it comes to small government, like you wanting small government. What's the opposition to that? What do they say?

Speaker 2:          01:31:57       Well, they say like a, they make a of it's insinuations because a lot of it isn't even things that I feel or believe. So an example would be, um, you know, I see a lot of people say all the time, like a column doesn't believe in welfare or column doesn't believe in, in social security. I'm like, I never said that actually. I just, I believe that these things should be reformed and maybe take it back a step. But they even look at that as a push too far on the, on the system. I guess what I'm trying to say to you, and I'm sorry I'm not being more lucid with you, I'm trying my hardest is, is that they're, they, you have to agree with them lockstep. If they see you in one way that is, that is, is injurious to their cars or two that is conflicting or contrary to what they believe.

Speaker 2:          01:32:35       They do not give a fuck about anything else you believe. And that's the thing that always frustrated me and what so surprising you with them. The people were really were running me out on a rail out of the gaming industry with the, with a completely innocuous joke, which I think tells you everything you need to know about the the intent that they don't see. They don't want allies in different ways. Allies in different close allies and that they want just. They just want complete, you know, it's very orwellian. They just want you to be completely like them and if you're not like then they don't want anything to do with you and it's these and it's not even like I was advocating for anything crazy. I don't advocate for anything crazy. I don't think

Speaker 3:          01:33:07       that doesn't sound crazy at all. But what's interesting is we've kind of turned a corner where in many ways the right is more tolerant than the left to variations in their ideology. Whereas the right is much more tolerant to people that support gay marriage. The right is much more tolerant to people. That, I mean this is. You fill in the blanks. There's a bunch of different rights that the right would sort of accept from someone who also voted Republican, but the left isn't like if, if you got to the point where like I got into a heated argument with someone wants about abortion, which I'm pro choice, but what I was saying, well essentially, but obviously it was a criticism of Richard Dawkins quote where he's comparing a human embryo to a, a pig fetus or a pig embryo. I forget what the terms of use, but I'm like, well that's ridiculous because one of them is going to become a person if you don't take it out of your body.

Speaker 3:          01:34:00       And that was the idea behind it. Like you can't, you can't use that sort of an analogy because it's not true. I mean it's just one has the potential for being a person and I was being accused by this guy of being right wing because of it. And I was like, well, I'm not right wing. I'm just talking about the potential for life. Like a pig embryo is never going to be my neighbor Mike. It's just not. You know what I mean? But that baby, I'm not saying you should be forced to make that baby a person and keep it in your body when it's a few cells and then two weeks old and then sit you. I'm not saying that you can't choose when to terminate your pregnancy, but what I'm saying is you're terminating a pregnancy. We both know what you're doing. I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do it, but to pretend that it's not messy and nobody wants it to be messy.

Speaker 3:          01:34:45       Nobody wants to be a complicated issue. They wanted to be cut and dry. If you're on the left in particular, it's pro choice, a woman's reproductive choice, freedom of your body to do what you want. I get all that. I'm 100 percent with you, but let's. Let's not lie about what it is because as soon as we know, as soon as we distort the reality of what the thing is, then we put up these ideological boundaries and blinders and we make communication very difficult and we make these rigid ideologies almost like a religion. They are almost like dogma. And when you do it, put it. I mean, when you do that, you have real problems because people can't communicate, so if someone does bring that up and say, well, you know, what is abortion? And then silence across the dinner table you hear people dropping their forks and like, what is abortion?

Speaker 3:          01:35:31       What are you doing? You're at what age is it okay to have an abortion? At what age is it? Not. Okay. Is it okay to abort a baby a day before it's born? No. No. Okay. So a but a month before? No. How about two months before? No. How about three? How about four? How about five? How about six? How about seven? Where do we. You know what I'm saying? Where do we get to the point where it's not a baby and I think that's a viable conversation and it's a real. It's a very uncomfortable discussion. As soon as you like me saying it right now, there's people listening to this right now that are in their car. Maybe there's a woman listening to this. It's had an abortion and she's like, I don't want to hear this, and she wants to shut it off. Maybe there's a guy who's trying to pressure his wife or girlfriend into having an abortion and he doesn't want to hear it, but what is it? What is abortion? What is it?

Speaker 2:          01:36:15       Right? It's, it's, it's, and this is what I always call it the, this, this issue, to me particularly joe is a 60 40 issue. What I always say is like, I am pro choice, but I respect the prolife argument and I don't think you should just have unfettered access to abortions forever. You know, like, like, you know, yeah. Two months, you know, something like that. Fourteen week, I don't know, I don't know what the number would be, what the number is. Fourteen weeks to months, but to me I'm like, yeah, what's happened when you make a great point? Because it's, it's, it's, it is this dogmatic sense of saying like it. Here's the way it is. That's it. It goes back to the, you know, I heard you talking about it. I was so. I was so glad to hear you say it because it goes back to like the war on women, right? Like there's just a whole group of people apparently in the country, a hundred 50 million of them. I hate women that, that because they're pro prolife for instance, which is a stance I don't share, but I respect. Why does that mean that they hate women? Why does it mean that like why does it always go from zero to 10 for like immediately it's like. And then there's all these lies mixed in like the um, uh, the, the, the pay gap, which is a fucking lie. Just lie.

Speaker 3:          01:37:13       It's not just a lot. It's a lot is perpetrated by Obama on TV talking about it. I mean, it's such a

Speaker 2:          01:37:20       confusing lie. It's just bizarre. It is demonstrably false and it is a lie. So why do I heat here? Keep it. Why does everyone want be so divisive? Why do you want to add more fuel to the fire when you can be like, hey, maybe we have problem x, Y, and Z, but this isn't a problem. Actually, I saw it again recently.

Speaker 3:          01:37:36       It was recently in the news. Somebody brought it up and it unchecked and unchallenged. Just explain to people if there were, because I've done it too many times, explained to people what the real pay gap is and what the issue is when, why it's using it incorrectly,

Speaker 2:          01:37:48       so the pay gap claimed by studies, I guess the Department of Labor or something is twenty one cents or something like that. So I was saying I think something like 70, every dollar a man makes a woman makes seventy nine cents. That's true. Only if you take every man, every woman take all of the money they make and divided by the amount of men in the amount of women doesn't take into account a careers, doesn't take into account personal choices. Women for instance, leave the workforce to have families. Sometimes men are gravitating towards engineering or physics or things that pay them a lot of money while women tend to, you know, tend maybe towards psychology or something like that. I think the argument is something like nine out of the 10 top grossing career choices are men dominated and nine out of the 10 lowest Korea money making career choices are actually dominated by women.

Speaker 2:          01:38:30       I think the only exception there is clergy which is dominated by men and so, but it doesn't, it doesn't adjust for any of these things, so when you actually adjust for choices, when you adjust for careers and longevity and hours and all of these things that are relevant, the pay gap closes to something like less than five cents and then there's even arguments saying that those could probably be explained away completely as well depending on what I know Christina Summers and some of the. Some of these people that know way more about this and I do have videos about if you actually dive in, you probably can get rid of the entire number completely, but the the, the prosperous to say that the woman makes seventy nine cents for every dollar

Speaker 3:          01:39:03       peated ad nauseum. The real issue is there. It's implying that two people working alongside each other at the apple store, the man is making $5 an hour. The woman is making seventy nine cents an hour less. Yeah. Than seventy nine cents per dollar less. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       It's just not true. Like significantly. And I liked the argument because it's true. You know why not, why if that was true, why wouldn't a corporation just hire women?

Speaker 3:          01:39:27       Seventy nine percent, I should say it right? Seventy nine cents to every dollar the manmade makes. Just corporations would Holler, hire women if they were just as competent, just as skilled, and it's not that. It's also men are more likely to die on the job. Men will more likely to pick way more dangerous careers like forest fighting, forest firefighting, whether it's a coal mining, all those things are dominated by men and a lot of people die and I'm law enforcement of course, who's A. There's a bunch of issues with it, but the problem is it's. It's spewed out as an indication that we are an inherently sexist society and whether or not you can find sexism in our society, I'm sure you can do it absolutely exists. Just as racism exists, I don't think it is nearly as much of a problem as they're trying to pin it out to me and I think there's a lot of other factors involved in why men make more money and one of them may be the demand for a higher salary when they're being hired. Better skills at negotiation or more confidence in those sorts of confrontations with employers or negotiations with employers. I mean there's a lot of factors but it doesn't do anybody any good to repeat a false statistic when it's provably false and then when people find out that it's false and then they lose confidence in the information they're being given,

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       it it. It's also. I think that's one half of the other half of it is like what does it say about a person that just continues to say it anyway, right? Like at some point, truth doesn't matter anymore. Right? Like I want to have. I want to have factual debates. I want to have like this is the starting, these are objective truths and then less debate about those things. Right. But if that's your starting point, if that's like a third of the entire reason why you're angry and in the streets in Washington DC, well then I don't even know what you're angry about anymore to be honest. It's the same. It goes back to like occupy Wall Street or all these things where I'm like, I don't know exactly what you're angry about and this is why this, this protest isn't working and isn't resonating with. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41:12       I saw people in the march for women, the women's march thing with signs talking about the gender pay gap. And so they had the time to make a sign. They had the time to take that sign and nail it to some boards and carry it around. But they didn't have time to Google whether or not that was true. They, this fascinating.

Speaker 2:          01:41:33       That's also fine. And I feel like some of them have to know,

Speaker 3:          01:41:37       right? Some of them they don't want to know, man. It's like I've read this thing once that said that a sperm cures depression in women. And uh, I didn't even look any further on micro got all the information I need. This, I don't want to just debunk, I want to be rock solid in my approach, shut the laptop and walked out of the room. I mean, that's really what's going on. It's like, that sounds great. If women make seventy nine cents to every dollar man makes it sounds awesome. This is a bullshit society. This, the patriarchy.

Speaker 2:          01:42:06       What? Patriarchy. Patriarchy. Patriarchy. Meanwhile, you asked them, you know, you, you ask, uh, uh, one of these feminists, there's a reason with feminism if, if, if the goal is for total equality, but we all know that that's now where really what feminism means to that, you know, if you sit there and be like, can you name just one thing that I can do that you can't just one, like, like one, like, and I'm not saying like you give birth, I can or something like something biological. I'm saying like, what can't you do? Like, like if you really want it to. I'm not saying that, you know, like I, I know for instance that um, you know, the, the, the examples that people give, and I haven't seen the statistics, but I've heard it circulated that even that, you know, companies are so desperate to hire women because of this, this situation, this optical situation that they're in where it seems like women are being pushed down that women in their twenties and thirties, we're actually making more now.

Speaker 2:          01:42:52       You know, that they're certainly, they're more likely to get a higher education. Certainly they're more likely be, you know, even graduate high school. So there are actually systemic benefits to being a woman and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that either. But I just feel like it goes, goes back to that thing of like, why are we fighting? Like, what is the divisive nature, can't we. And this goes back to your question about the video game industry. I'm like, Hey, instead of yelling at me about this, we won't agree about this, these situations over here, but can we advocate for these together? Or do you not want to, you wanna you wanna you don't want my advocacy for gay marriage because I believe in small government, you all my advocacy for a, you know, transgender rights because I'm for low taxes, just like, I'm like, okay, that's weird because we can totally be friends here with the women's March. I know that there were problems with pro life organizations getting involved at a sponsorship level even. Oh Wow. And uh, it's like they're not women. They're, they, they're, they're, they're lesser than debate

Speaker 3:          01:43:45       about that one issue. Yeah. Strange. You said something that I want to go back to what, what do you think feminism is about?

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       What's his argument about, about equality? I mean, to me, feminism was about equality and I think that this, this, this, you know, I'm reading more about it and learning more about it, so I'm still very ignorant about it. But this third wave, what they call it, third wave feminism, which I'm sure is a term you've heard, that seems to be more about a combative nature to actually, you know, instead of like saying like men and women are equal, men and women should deserve the same rights and the same treatment and all those kinds of things. It's actually seems to be very anti man in a way. Like it seems to be very, like almost like the tables have turned, you know, and I'm like, well why are you turning the tables like we didn't have you achieve what you want in like in the first place, which was just that we were going to be here together at the, you know, at the, at the, at the nexus of everything as two genders.

Speaker 3:          01:44:33       Problem is that reinforcing that fake statistic, the, the gender pay gap that so many people have heard that. Like Sarah Silverman was just talking about a recently and some, some big thing that she did. I'm like, that's not true, but yet people just say it and no one stops them from Santa. A friend of mine that was a very educated guy said it, we were having a debate about a divorce and he brought it up and I was like, that's not even true, and unfortunately we're in a place with no cell phone reception, so I had to wait until we got back to send it to them. Like this is not true. Like what you're saying is not true. Like you're repeating it as if you know, but meanwhile you've done zero research on it. It's a talking point that just gets reiterated over and over again without any research and it's convenient.

Speaker 3:          01:45:14       It's convenient to reinforce your argument. It's a number. It's a number that deals with a very complex and nuanced debate and I think that the idea of feminism is to me in a lot of ways, very similar to the idea of the men's rights movement. I'm not opposed to rights for anybody. I'm not opposed to anyone. I'm very egalitarianism ideas about the world, but I am opposed to anybody that likes one gender over the other because I think that's foolish. Just like I'm opposed to people that only like white people. I'm going to pose to people that only like black people, I'm opposed to people that generalize based on an enormous mass of human beings. Like men are shit, women rule, girls rule, boys drool. You know, I, I don't like it the other way either. I don't like it that he man, woman haters club. I don't like. I don't like any ideologies that lump people into these huge groups because I think it's more on think. I think it's a stupid way of looking at the world.

Speaker 2:          01:46:11       Yeah, I agree. And I, I'm, I'm the same way that the yellow tarian nature is the best that the, the, uh, live and let live nature to judge people based on their character and the quality of their intelligence or whatever it is you're looking for in them. Shouldn't be categorized in these specific ways by sex or gender or by race or religion by any of those kinds of things. I'm totally with you there, but I think we both agree that women shouldn't be allowed to vote, right? I mean, yeah, I mean that was a. women have suffered long enough, enough already at girls I used to. I used to think that joke was so funny. You want mean you get murdered for that joke today with like the women's suffrage suffragettes like women have suffered long enough instead of suffering whatever. And I was like, it's a funny joke. I'd probably, that would've ruined my career to, on twitter, but uh, it didn't ruin your career.

Speaker 3:          01:46:49       It just, it gave you a platform. Honestly, it's all, it all balances out. It's slow. As long as you're being attacked for something that's not valid,

Speaker 2:          01:46:56       it all balances out. It just takes. You take a little heat and then you realize like, okay, I'm through that. Yeah. It was scary for a little while. It was scary. I don't know if scary is the right word. It's, it was, it was uncomfortable. It was uncomfortable and unsettling. And you really saw where everyone stood. Right? So one of the things I was talking with people about was, you know, how sad it was for me that no, like very few people that I knew came to my defense and I wasn't saying they had to come to my defense and be like, uh, uh, Collin, you know, that joke was fine. Like, if you didn't like the joke, that's, I don't care. It's fine. Jokes fall flat all the time. You know, that you're a comedian. It's, it's hard. I don't do it professionally. I mean it's impossibly hard to get on the stage and do that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:47:32       But to me I was like, hey, is anyone going to say that I'm not a sexist? Is anyone going to stand up that's known me for 10 years and say like, Hey, we don't agree with the joke, but the way you're categorizing this guy who I know is not accurate. And I heard that there were some fights behind the scenes with people and I got a lot of DMZ messages but very little in terms of public support. And that really hurt me. Like that really, really hurt me and wounded me in a deep way and ruin friendships like that I had for years, like fake friendship

Speaker 3:          01:47:59       man, and you know, and people probably felt the need to toe the line, you know, toe this, I don't want to say party line, but the ideological ideological line mean the dogmatic line if you, if you run into someone who is in any way involved in any sort of a dispute that makes that person appear to be a sexist, you're supposed to pile on.

Speaker 2:          01:48:22       Yeah. And, and, and, and that's exactly what they did. And the thing that hurt me the most is that I didn't expect it. I'm not close with a lot of these people, but people that know me, you know, there are people in this industry that are writing that we're piling on me or remaining silent that got freelance work because of me that got maybe even got hired because I was on a hiring committee that put, you know, push for them. Uh, all of these kinds of things that people used to take out to lunch when I was senior editor to see how they were doing, if there's anything I can do for them, stuff like that. And everyone's just like, no, not going to stay. I'm not going to come back and help help him out now. And I tried to put that good energy out there.

Speaker 2:          01:48:52       I'm not always full of good energy. Sometimes I say negative things or bad things. Sometimes they make mistakes, but when it comes, when a person comes after your character and you damn well know that there are a bunch of people around you that know who you are, whether or not they agree with what you said or agree with what you do, but they know you're who you are. And they know the severity of what people are saying and they don't say anything that really wounds a person and that really fucking hurt. Do you think? I think

Speaker 3:          01:49:15       that what's going on and a lot of ways when people did not come to your defense is that what you're doing, um, in, in many ways is making a very complicated and nuanced perspective from a person in your, in your stance, you're, you're kind of, you're, you're taking this, this, this path outside of the ideology and by doing so you sort of challenge a lot of the ways these people have been behaving for a long time and as soon as you do

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       that, they have to kind of reconsider these ideological boundaries that you've set up and their own behavior and thinking and communication and that they don't want to do that and they, they don't want to do that. Like to keep things rigid and simple and they also want to continue to progress in their career. And in order to do that you have to kind of like have this predetermined pattern that you follow. I think simple is the key word that simple because yes they can. There are people out there that can not comprehend how a person who believes in small government, for instance, we'll use the same argument that says the government can't touch my guns. That's consistent with saying the government can't tell a woman what to do with her body that's consistent with principle. It says, I'm a government shouldn't even be involved in telling you who you can marry in the mannequin.

Speaker 1:          01:50:30       Could she be able to marry a man and a woman should be able to marry a woman and I would go as far as to say that even a polygamist totally on the, on the up and up, everyone's in on it. Relationship should not be the government. The that of course, they cannot acknowledge that it's the lack of governmental power that gives you that. Right? In my perspective, when they feel like it's the wielding of government power that ensures those, those rights, that's not the. That's not congruent with them. They don't understand how the how, how. We don't understand how we came to the same exact conclusion by going just totally two different directions and that really that challenges them and they don't have the philosophical boundary bounding to figure out how that might be. No. Well, that's the argument that the philosophy has to be bound in writing has to be bound in some sort of a doctrine.

Speaker 1:          01:51:09       It has to be written down on paper and established and enforced by a government that's. That's like a big daddy thing, you know? I mean instead of saying, give the power to the people, let people do whatever they would like to do as long as they're not infringing upon the rights of others and let's have less and less people dictating what people get to do. Right, and that's, that to me is liberty and they and they look at it or I don't want to say that, but a lot of people, a lot of progressives are regressives men. They only want to look at them. We'll look at it and be like, well, the government has one shared these things because these are not natural. These are not natural rights are. These are not things that can be insured and I'm like, but in the national society and the natural sense, we have to have a consistent rights.

Speaker 1:          01:51:46       I can't in good faith say like I have the right to wield a gun because the government can't tell me that even though it's enshrined in the bill of rights, but then say like, oh, the government can get involved in your bedroom though. All of the garment can tap your phone. Oh, the government. I'm like, no, it's either all or nothing and if you and if, if that's. If that's a philosophy that's too hard for people to wrap their minds around and I don't know what to say about that, but to me it's. It's to me it's pretty clear and pretty lucid the way I feel. My principals are rooted in that philosophy. Also. I think when people there, they're seeking this sort of comfort level in, in life and in, in, in their positions and I don't necessarily think people understand that as soon as you allow the government to much power, you will never get that back. As soon as they have power. As soon as they can take away some of your liberties, those will never get returned or one of the rare ones is marijuana. It is a really. Well, it was. I was trying to explain to someone the other day about this, like it's incredibly rare that something becomes legal that was illegal. As long as marijuana. It's very rare, like something has be in a just

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       completely undeniably good for it to have gone through all the propaganda, all the bullshit, all the lies, all the governmental regulations. So the people being locked up in jail for life or and then still come out the other side on 2017 and be legal and a bunch of states recreationally. Yeah. Not even just medically. It's great to see, but it's fascinating because it's one of the rare instances where liberty last is regained and most of the time it's not. It's just not.

Speaker 2:          01:53:14       It's an aberration and that's what people have to be really scared of and that's. That goes to the point. It's like I don't want to give anything an inch because I am afraid of the consequences of giving anyone an inch. That's why I wouldn't apologize for the joke, that's why I resigned from my company instead of apologizing for the joke. Wow. Could you apologize for that? So first of all, it's a honeymooners married with children all in the family level jokes, something you'd see on the floor of a CBS writers room and it and, but uh, but the point is that I could have probably apologizing for, but I'm like, no because a, I'm not sorry. So that'll be a huge lie. Be Like I have to now really recalibrate the way I go about my business with, you know, with my partners and with the audience because, you know, I didn't have the protections that I thought I would have when, when the mistake was made, you know what I mean? Like I didn't and that was what hurt me. So I, I tried to do what I thought was the most principled and character driven choice which would be like, this is best for my partners who don't agree with me. This is best for the audience who might not agree with me. It seems like a lot of them do. And this is the best for just everyone moving forward. I'll have other opportunities and other things that I can do.

Speaker 3:          01:54:14       Has it been any blowback, um, targeted towards the people that were upset at you?

Speaker 2:          01:54:19       Yes. Uh, and the thing that, the, you know, it's sad to see because it's not in my eye. I feel like I'm a pretty good natured person and I don't like CP seeing that rubber band effect going on where people now are suffering because they stood up and stood out or whatever. It's just that. And I don't care about the people that were out to character assassinate me. I'm talking about like, you know, my and my business partners and stuff. It's just that like, no matter what I say will be twisted. I tried to be very magnanimous and like very kind about it when I was on Ruben the second time and people twisted everything to just be a problem anyway. So I'm like, I'll just remain silent because I'd rather than misconstrue the silence that misconstrue the words, you know? Um, is that

Speaker 3:          01:54:53       problem? No, the, if you, if you're not communicating freely and because you're worried about the repercussions,

Speaker 2:          01:54:58       I'm not worried about the repercussions. For me, I'm worried about foisting repercussions on other people that have no control over what I'm saying.

Speaker 3:          01:55:03       Yeah. But even even that, it's like it's not your responsibility as long as you're communicating in an honest way. Sure. I mean you're thinking that's sort of the same reason why people didn't come to your support in the first place because they were worried that if they spoke their mind, they would be targeted. If they said, hey, you know, I know that this is going on. I think Collins, a great guy, I don't think he's sexist and my feeling on them is that it was just a joke and then they could get targeted and they chose not to. They chose not to step up and, and a lot of ways you not speaking your mind in a clear way sort of sets that same sort of tone. I think you should be able to speak freely and I think you should be held responsible for when you say something and irresponsible like it's or it's wrong or it's hurtful in some ways and people make mistakes like that all the time and there's also we have to take into account that a lot of times people don't realize the consequences of their words or they say things in a flippant manner or they're tired or they're stressed or things come out that they don't necessarily believe in that way, but especially when it comes to like something like twitter or some short form short paragraphs sort of a thing.

Speaker 3:          01:56:06       I think it's really important that we be given the opportunity to express ourselves fully and then the disagreements with that be categorized in an honest way and what I had the most problem with was not just someone calling you a racist, but everyone was making it out to be this horrible, sexist, evil thing. When it's clearly something said in jest and as soon as you can. And that's my wheelhouse. As soon as you start taking humor and something that people say that it's absolutely meant to be just funny and make it as like the, Oh, this guy just signed an affidavit that women should shut the fuck up because it's better. I mean, that's really the worst case scenario. Interpretation of what you said.

Speaker 2:          01:56:49       Yeah. And, and uh, yeah, I think that that was the disappointing part of it was again, it goes back to this point of like ignored everything. Like my body of work, the things that I actually stood up very loudly for political and social causes. Many times there are huge videos I have of the things that my feelings on the confederate flag or like how I feel like. What did you think about the confederate flag? I think that you have the right to fly it. I just think it's in terrible taste and I understand why people were upset about it and I don't think it should be in. I don't think the flag of a trader is country. It should be instituted in state flags in the United States.

Speaker 3:          01:57:19       He's your dad I think is absolutely valid. Do you think that it's legal, is it legal to have a Nazi flag? Is it

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       almost wants to go? Yeah, I would. I only see why it wouldn't be legal to have the confederate flag, but you just can't have it on the Dukes of hazzard. Well, to me it's like I'm not talking about the legality of it because if you want to fly a swastika out your house, you're allowed to. I think you should probably be allowed to do that. I don't think. I think you're an absolute idiot for doing that, but that's your right to be an idiot. But the confederate flag thing was just a sign for me because it was, it was this, it was this, uh, this, this juxtaposition of saying, look, well we're talking about the legal rights, but actually I'm talking about the taste, right? You know, like say like, people don't remember what the CSA was. I don't think a lot of people even fly that flag and know what the hell they're flying this country seceded from the United States.

Speaker 2:          01:58:03       They were traders and or their Leonard skinner fence, or they're huge Leonard skinner advance a huge big and Mississippi like, you know, but to me I'm like, we have to have, let's, let's put this in historicity. Let's think about what we're doing here. This country left to protect its slaves. It's right to own slaves. Any other interpretation of it is wrong based on, on what was going on in the 18 fifties and leading up to 18, 60 these states' rights advocate and all that. That's not what it was about economics. It's not what it was about. It wasn't about states' rights, it wasn't about any of those things. It was about your ability. Your economy would have fallen apart without free labor. And these people left. They caused a gratuitously bloody war and then they were let me know both Abraham Lincoln and then Andrew Johnson, just let them back in, you know, uh, Jefferson Davis who was the president of the confederacy, wasn't murdered.

Speaker 2:          01:58:52       He wasn't executed, you know, like they were all back in. And for some reason, because reconstruction went the way it did into the, into the ulysses s grant, kind of a era of presidency, people look at it and be like, well, things kind of ended good and they're kind of like brothers again. And I'm like, that's not really the way it was with Jim crow came up and stuff like that. This fucking flag means something, the Pfarius and you can't. So it's your right to fly it. And if you feel like that's a southern pride thing, more power to. I love the south. I think the south awesome south needs another flag. But yeah, you would need to. You need to know what this flag means to people. You guys left, you guys killed hundreds of thousands of people doing it and, and you just fly. This flag is like the south will rise again. No, it won't.

Speaker 3:          01:59:34       Don't you think that that's a bad expression. The south will rise again is a terrible expression. But I think that a lot of people look at that flag and it represents what we're calling southern pride, which is nothing wrong. Nothing wrong with being proud of being from Georgia or wherever the fuck your friends states down there. Yeah, but I think the, the issue is what it means to other people you know, and whether or not that's valid when you're not talking about like touchy feely, like people being oversensitive. Now you're talking about a horrible war about slavery. It's like probably one of the worst kinds of wars like a war because we would like to keep people in prison and working for free. So we're willing to kill other people over it to fight for that. Right. This is essentially what it was. Right. So it's to the people of today, it doesn't seem like that because they're not living in 1850, they're not in the days when you know, they have these massive like, like Gettysburg or they have these massive areas where people would be slaughtered. I mean this people to this day, that's still fine. Like civil war shit where they had these massive battles and they can dig through the ground with metal detectors and they find bullets and guns and badges and

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       awesome. It's great. It's great. I mean, I, I took the idea from a saving private Ryan, the guy that would take dirt from all the battlefields, that they would go to them, put it in, put it in jars, he and you put it. They only showed it once in the movie, but I used to go to all these battlefields when I was a kid because I was fascinated by my parents would bring me in, I would take, I would go buy baby food and dumped them out and then go to all the battlefields and put dirt on each of them and put them on. Oh, that's heavy. Yeah. I like this. When you were a kid. Yeah, like my in my teens and early twenties. Yeah. So you've always been into this. Yes. Since I was, uh, my earliest memory is of being in the politics and history was, was the Gulf War, which was 99, kind of the lead up to it with Kuwait and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:01:15       90 91. So I was like six or seven. I remember, you know, Newsday, as Long Island newspaper, I remember just seeing images and kind of maps and, and I didn't really understand what was going on. I couldn't even read most of the words. I mean, it's complicated geopolitical stuff they're talking about, but I ever since that point I was very politically focused on my dad is a staunch, like Rockefeller Republican, like a Paleo con, like a moderate Republican, um, in the old north, you know, people out there right now. But like Republicans are pretty disparate group, like Republicans in New England are. Republicans in New York are very different than Republicans in Texas, but they're both Republicans and my dad grew up just in, you know, giving me things to read and, and feeding that fire and by me maps and buying me books and we will listen to talk radio and we would debate things and we would kind of come to these conclusions of different things.

Speaker 2:          02:02:01       And we disagree with that. A lot of things still to this day. But he's a great man. And uh, ever since then I was really, really interested in. I knew when I was fourth or fifth grade that I would study history and I remember in New York we have this thing called the regions in high school which are like these tests, these state run tests you have to pass to graduate, so like you would take your class but then you have to take your final, but then you have to take a regents exam which is the state run thing, say like, you know, math, you know, whatever. And I remember when I was in sixth grade and my sister alley who is six years older than me, it was taking the US history regents like the next few days from then. And I helped her study and I, and like I remember like she didn't know any really anything she needed to know and I taught her like what she needed to know just for this very rudimentary test.

Speaker 2:          02:02:41       And that was stuck in my mind where I was like, the, I have a real passion for this. I really like it. I enjoy it. I don't know everything. I make mistakes sometimes and I changed the way I feel sometimes, but it's always been a real, real fascinating. Now that you've left your company, the which was, wow, what was it called? Kind of fun. Kind of funny. Yeah, and what was kind of funny, kind of funny was the four of us that founded the company were all at ign in different respects and we spun off to just start our own youtube channel about games and nerd culture and stuff like that, do podcasts and we found some good success, almost a crowdfunded on Patrion and it was a lot of fun. Then I enjoyed it, but I felt like I needed to leave because I felt like that was the best for everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:03:18       Well, once that. I mean, how could you not if he turned on you over that stupid fucking joke. Yeah, I mean it's like, it was a stupid joke. It was a bad joke, but I mean it's not even that bad. No, I appreciate that. That means a lot coming from you. I looked at it. That's stupid. The reaction to it was so fucking stupid. It was stupid and I felt like, you know, I wish that I wish that things went differently. I wish that, you know, we had a lot of fights behind the scenes. I won't get into all that. I don't think. I honestly think it's good. I think it's good to. I don't, I don't know. I, I felt like I did what was right for them and I felt like we would have just come to this impasse again. So I was like, let's just pull the bandaid off and get to get this over with.

Speaker 2:          02:03:51       Are you going to do something that involves politics now? Because clearly you have a deep passion for this. Yeah. I started a, uh, a new youtube channel that the first video about April third. It's called Colin's last stand. Um, and crazy. It's already funded on Patrion 38, $38,000 a mind for. Well, it's. People are committing an expression. I do it. Yeah, because I think it's powerful. Like there are things worth dying for things worth risking. There it is. So I, I reached $39,000 a month and it's going to fall $39,000 a month. People it's going to fall. I'm sure it's going to fall. People. Shit Dude. People are talking. People are responding to my this holy Shit. That's a lot of fucking money. 30 nine grand a month. You're going to get $39,000 a month and you haven't even started yet. Yeah, technically. But it's going to fall back down to the teens.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       Probably relaxed with your humility will take it down. If you scroll here, you'll see on the left side, underneath the number. My stretch goal is to reach $10,000. So my, my, my expectations were blown out of the water and I really. What I read into the show is, is, is you know, people are just sick of this bullshit. This is them, this is them speaking and being like we need a conduit that's going to get into the history and get into the philosophy and the politics. But also that will stand up and say like, I'm not sorry for a joke. People have the right to make mistakes. People have the right to express themselves. It goes back to the confederate flag thing. I might disagree with a person that flies that flag, but I'm not going to go wrap up on their door and pull it off and call them a racist.

Speaker 2:          02:05:17       I'm just going to shake my head and walk, you know, because there are other things to worry about. So it's people that like want more liberty focused, individual focused kind of things and that's just people speaking to me, you know, so. So the number will fall back down after the month. I'm sharing. That's fine. Just stop synchronet drive me crazy with this fake humility. It's not humility out. Actually I remember I was going to fall. No, people are gonna like me less but, but, but, but my, my whole Dad's side, it's really not fake humility. It's me saying like, I hear you and I'll do my very best to do this. The numbers keep going up. The problem is everyone's going to know what the numbers are and they're going to go out or I need to give him any money. He's making $39,000 a month.

Speaker 2:          02:05:54       That's fine, that's not fine. She'd hide that number. Can you hide it? You can, but I feel like I want to be. I want to be, I want to be honest with people and oh my God, if you weren't patrion you'd frigging kill. Got to get that cash the sun. But yeah, you kind of hide it, but I want it to be totally transparent. What I keep telling people is, as long as we keep a level of sustainable level of money, which is way less than what I have now, there'll be no baked and adds, no product placements, none of that. And I want people to know I want, I want people to be involved in the, in it from. It's. So Colin's last stand is about politics. It's going to be. Yeah. So I want to do two videos a week between 10 and 15 minutes long each that are scripted and written.

Speaker 2:          02:06:25       Um, and I know how to edit and something. I'm very good at it. The quality of the videos, uh, from a, from an ethical perspective, you'll find better quality. But I want the content to be really good. And so I want to just do two videos a week, one probably focused on history and one probably focused on politics. So one that's more rooted in, in philosophy that I'll go research and write. I'm already researching and writing the first one. I don't want to ruin it for anyone yet, but I think it'd be really fun. And then the second, maybe the second video every week will be something about what's happening in the world and I'll talk to a camera and just be like, this is the way I feel about this. This is maybe why I feel this way. And just. And just some stuff out there.

Speaker 2:          02:06:55       You know, I want to treat people's time with care. I don't have the brand you have. I don't have, you know, people that are, that are religious about listening to everything I do. So I want people to like look forward to saying like, Oh, twice a week column. I put up a 10 minute video that I can just, when I'm making dinner, just listened to it in the background and then go about my day and maybe learn something or maybe feel a certain way or maybe I disagree and then move on and, and, and, and have it just be a part of people's lives. And that. So clearly you've put a lot of thought into this and you've thought this through obviously something you're really planning out. Well, yeah, I'm trying. I mean that was actually the one, the number kept rising. I was horrified like at first because I was like, because I was like, I have that ability.

Speaker 2:          02:07:31       Like I hate money though. It was of course I love money but I, I, it's like the imposter syndrome where you never really know that you're earning it or whatever. And I'm like, I want, I don't want to let anyone down. I only have right now the intro video, which is just me talking to the camera kind of with what my plan is. I'm trying to really keep people engaged and putting update videos on and letting them know where everything is. Um, but yeah, it was horrified because I'm like, you know, I only have the bandwidth to do two videos a week, whether I'm making $15,000 a month or $40,000 a month. And so if I put out a video to everyone being like, if this level sustained or even a level that's in the twenties or thirties, whatever it is, I have to recalibrate what I'm thinking, you know, maybe I do hire someone to help me shoot.

Speaker 2:          02:08:08       Maybe I do higher bandwidth. What do you mean by a bank? The bandwidth, because I don't want people were like, oh, can we get a podcast? Can we do more videos a week and stuff. And I'm like, that's not the vision for the product. I only have enough bandwidth in my mind to. Right. And it doesn't create time and space, right. And, uh, the money gives me means in the future to maybe make the product more dynamic or interesting or hire people and do more. But right now I just want to spend a few months to like, be like, this is what I'm planning, I want to write these things, I want to put care into them. I want to give you citations. I wanna like have you give you further things to read and all those kinds of things. And that takes time. So you always like this, like really hyped up and energetic.

Speaker 2:          02:08:42       Do you always have like this much energy? You always talk this fast. I'm a fast talker. That's in New York thing, but I'm a. I used to live in New York. You didn't know a lot of people that talked very fast. They do it, but you're like fucking ramped up. It's because it's something I'm passionate about. You know, it's A. I don't mean to come off as annoying or anything. No, no, no. You're not annoying at all. It's impressive. Thank you. I just try to. These are the things that I forgot for so long in a way, because I was writing about games, which I love. I Love Games. I think they're important. They're an important piece of escape. They're an important piece of art. I think that's all great, but being able to engage with someone like yourself with someone like Dave Rubin or someone like a Steven crowder, whoever it might be.

Speaker 2:          02:09:21       I was on Glenn Beck's radio show last week. It brings out an energy in me that I, I didn't, I was, he wear boats. I don't know. I was on the phone, so I have no, he could have been naked for all and uh, but it brings out an energy in me where I'm like, I can finally engage with people that know what the fuck they're talking about in this particular realm, which I think is so exciting and so interesting and we can have, you know, we had, we debated, we don't agree on everything. I think that's awesome. So that's really cool that you found, uh, a very big positive out of this. Now you can express yourself more honestly and you can, you can gravitate towards your real interests. And yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to use this as an opportunity for myself and try and use it as an opportunity to just carve out a little slice of the Internet, however big or small it might be, where we can affect some positive change and like an idea ideas and learning and free expression and free thought and making mistakes and disagreeing and all that.

Speaker 2:          02:10:13       I think that's all great. I want to use this as an example. I want to get away from the Orthodoxy of the gaming industry. It's stifling and strangling and that's what you think. Let's go back to that because why do you think it is like that? Why is the gaming industry so hardcore ideologically left wing progressive like no variations? No room for debate. Why is that? Well, I think it's portrayed. It's like it all gets funneled through a media that is, that is hyper liberal, right? So it's, it's similar in a way to what's going on with the media in news and politics. These, um, you know, underneath the surface of the gaming industry are, there are plenty of conservatives and libertarians, they, they hide the. Yeah, they do. A lot of them. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, go ahead. I was going to say, a lot of them talk to me.

Speaker 2:          02:10:56       I mean, I know people that are like heads of studios that feel the way I do. I know people that are in the trenches at Qa and doing very menial things that gaming studios, I feel the way I do and everything in between. I remember a GDC game developer conference in San Francisco, which happens every spring. Six or seven years ago, a guy pulled me aside. This the first time it ever happened to me, and this was when I was kind of starting to make a name for myself and he pulled me aside and he's like, hey man, I work at x, Y andZ and um, it works on a big game and he's like, keep doing what you're doing. There are a lot of people out there that agree with what you're saying. Um, but they're, they're, they, they don't dare speak out because they'll get lambasted in some way.

Speaker 2:          02:11:31       Look what happened to me over something so innocuous. Well, you there, obviously you were saying that there is some pushback about your ideas before this. Yes. What did you experience? Well, so every time I would write a politically driven an op Ed for instance, when I was at ign, I had, I was, I was senior editor, but I kinda had like editor at large qualities were meaning for people I don't know, editor at large, basically in a way do whatever they want. Like they'll find something to write about. I used to go away for days at a time and over research things and then write these big 50,000 word articles. I'm 50,000 words. Yeah. The history of not that kind of time, dude. Well I, I, I did, I carved it out. But what about people reading it? It was in five parts. The history of naughty dog was like my opus naughty dog's this very huge actually in Santa Monica, a very huge game developer, very talented game developer.

Speaker 2:          02:12:15       I went and talked at 19 people, got about a bunch of primary sources and and all these things and wrote this piece that I really cared about. Um, and so, but when I would write things like the political correctness piece about, let me give you an example. There's a game that was canceled a maybe five years ago or so. It was pretty late in development. So it's weird to have to cancel a when they've already spent a bunch of money on it. It was called six days in Fallujah and it was a game about, it was the third person shooter. I think about, uh, the experience of Fallujah in Iraq, you know, terrible conflict that, that happened there. And people even on the right were getting upset about being like, it's too soon. It's, it's, uh, this is, this is still ongoing, how can you do?

Speaker 2:          02:12:55       And I wrote a piece being like, what are you all saying? Like, this is awesome, this is so great that someone wants to tell a story like this and, and, and, and do something like this and you just get it from all sides. People will be like, you know, it's, it's not sensitive. It's, it's all of these kinds of things. And then the girlfriend mode thing I wrote about where people were like, oh, you're a sexist and blah blah blah blah blah. And I'm like, I'm actually just protecting the sanctity of a man who might've made a mistake. That's it, you know, instead of destroying him, it goes back to this whole thing of, like the last year that, I'm sorry, the, the girlfriend mode, the borderlands story I told you you were with the guy and they were all going after him and going after his job and do these things.

Speaker 2:          02:13:31       And I wrote a piece being like, hey, yeah, like if this is a far skies, like he made a mistake maybe and I don't know that he should have is a soft target and they just went after it. Exactly. And uh, it reminds you that you experienced blowback. Yeah. Every time from that. Yeah. Every time. What was the blow back from that, from you defending this guy saying, well, he just really fucked up the way he described things, but he was, it was an innocent in that regard. Well, you lose like social cache when every time it's something like this would happen. Right, so that's why I say like this was the moment, the joke was the moment that they were looking to pounce really, and I'm not saying that they were calculating, everyone's waiting, but they saw an opportunity and they took it because over time you lose respect over people because of your political stances.

Speaker 2:          02:14:11       He completely reasonable political stances I think where they remember that you said this and he said this and he said this doesn't really, you weren't really having debates with people where you were disagreeing with them. It was simply a matter of reaction to some of the things that you had written where they were trying to box you into some sort of a conservative group. Right. And they would call me in, you know, now it's like I'm a Nazi, I'm all right. I'm, I'm like, I don't think, I don't think I have one. I don't think I've won outright. I don't even really know what the alt right means. But like what, like what is outright lying to me, it seems like the far fringe is like the Richard Spencer is of the world, the Neo Nazis in the white supremacists and the actual, uh, nationalists, you know. Well, as soon as you write alt on something, I feel like it's a message board thing.

Speaker 2:          02:14:49       Like, all right, it's like, it's a, it's a reddit thing. Yeah, exactly. So, all right. Alternative. Right? Like what is it? I mean, I, I don't, I don't know. I hope not based on their, based on their, based on their characterization of it, but to me. I'm sorry, go ahead. No. Well, what is a, what, how would they define you as being alt right? What would they say that you have outright characteristics. You can see these, you know, a message boards for instance, a lot of people were very supportive on reddit and all these kinds of plays that are a little more known for free thought. But there's this one video game, a message board in particular, um, that is just insane. And there was a hundred and 25 page or so thread about me, 20 posts or I think it might even be 50 posts the page and I was reading it and it hurts some of it because people are like, first of all, people telling me I said things I never said one thing.

Speaker 2:          02:15:38       People like Collins against his name is no taxation is going to believe that taxes should exist. He often talk about how I really like Ian Rand and I really like atlas shrugged, but I don't consider myself an objectivist. I don't believe that selfishness is necessarily a virtue. I just think she's interesting and I think some of our ideas are interesting. You know, God forbid I exist somewhere in the gray area, but they're like collins and objective, acidity, selfish and blah blah blah. And like collins a Nazi and he, he's a racist. He's a PSA. I think the term, a lot of the news with soft racist or soft bigot, soft race being like that. He, he doesn't, he doesn't intentionally or actually overtly say anything but supports causes that are racist or sexist. These are the kinds of characterizations that were going on basically people with, on, on, on, um, on bulletin boards with, with yarn and maps, like that's how I picture them, like trying to make continuous connections and, and, and it's like these things aren't even things I feel and, and things that I said or being

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       taken out of context. I often use the, I'm in video games. One of the big things is like, you know, there's a need for diverse casts and diverse protagonists and stuff like that. And I often use the case that I used to use the saying, I don't believe in diversity for diversity's sake. I believe that an artist should tell his story, so of an artist, a writer, and have a game, wants to have an all white cast and that's what he thinks serves the story. I don't think that makes them a racist. If he wants to have an all Asian cast, I don't think that makes them a racist either. I think that's what he wants to do. Um, and people took that out of context and we're calling me a racist and a bigot. And all these kinds of things and it's, it's, it's hurtful because there's no one there to, that.

Speaker 1:          02:17:03       No one's defending me, you know, and I can't, I can't defend myself because I'll just make it worse. So it was kind of like this hapless kind of situation that I found myself in and I tried to make the best of it. I had a debate once about that with a friend who was an Asian actor and he was talking about the lack of roles for Asians in Hollywood and what a massive issue is and you know that he wanted to raise awareness of it. And I was like, man, but this, we're talking about a creative venture. You're talking about somebody writing a story. Like I think the correct way to go about it is to try to figure out how to get your own project through or someone else who feels very strongly about this. Trying to get their on project through, but the right way is not for someone to have to compromise their creative vision in order to encompass the full spectrum of races in whatever story they're writing.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       Like creative story. Like if you want to write a story about a small town in Maine, like Stephen King has done so often, you shouldn't have to have 10 percent Asians in that story. I mean, you just, that's not what creativity is about. It's about, uh, there, there are places and people and the way you're going to run into all black folks or were you going to run into all Norwegian people? I mean, in those stories are just as valid as a story that's fully diverse, you know? No, I don't think that that necessarily makes anything better. And I also think that when you're talking about that, you're sort of talking about it. Like there should be a quota, you know, and like Hollywood should recognize the need for these people to be in films and movies and it's just, you, you're, you're making this politically correct sort of, um, be passing these, these judgements on this thing that is all about imagination.

Speaker 1:          02:18:41       I mean, Hollywood essentially. Like what, when you're making a television show, are you making a movie is really about an imagination. It's about imagination and vision and having that vision being entertaining for people and if you like, only want to write about the people that you were in college with, you were that you shared a dorm room with you should be out aloud to and if there's a disproportionate amount of people that are doing that, that happened to be white males that we should probably try to figure out why, but the idea that you have to force people to hire Asian folks or black folks or women or whatever. That's. That seems so crazy to me. Serve the story. Right, and to give you a little glimpse, to give you some context with what might be going on in gaming. There was this very popular game series called the Witcher, which is made by a Polish developer called CD project.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       I'm there in Warsaw and it's based on the fusion of like Polish kind of identity with this famous book series that's based on like kind of Polish or you know, like kind of the Lord of the rings, but in Eastern Europe and one guy is cartoon character that works at this website called Polygon. In his review was talking about how uh, there were no, there was no diversity there and everyone's like, dude, it's Poland and it's based on Poland of your life and it's about dragons and like goblins and there's some white guys and this is like what you're upset about, you know, and there's another guy making it and I think he's Slovakia and I don't want to. Somewhere in eastern Europe making a game called kingdom come deliverance and it's supposed to be very realistic. Look at something like the 14th or 15th century in that area. And again, the, they're complaining, there's no diversity, there's no diversity.

Speaker 2:          02:20:22       And he's like, there was no black people in this area in 1500. I'm trying to make a game that's true to the air. Does that, that doesn't make him a racist. And, and these are the kinds of. This is just the kind of bullshit. That's why. But you see this in movies, you see this in TV shows. It's, it's not exclusive to gaming, but it's. But it's what I've had to deal with for a long time. And I'm just looking at the root of it though, what, what's causing it? Like why, why do people feel like they have to put a black person in a game about Poland in the 15 hundreds or whatever it was. I think, I mean, I don't. Thankfully, the people that make the games don't care, you know, like they're, they're like, we're going to make our game, right? The people that are complaining about it, there are virtuous virtue signaling, which is not even a term I even knew what it meant until a few weeks ago.

Speaker 2:          02:21:02       Like, I heard people throw that term around. I didn't quite know what a man I looked at it, I looked into it. It's, you know, and you know what it is. It's the idea that these virtuous people, it's the same people that attacked me for the joke. I have to be virtuous and show that I am against sexism. So I have to attack the man. You know, I have to do all these kinds of things in this need, you know? But what they're saying, when they, when they, when they're saying we have to have black people in this game, in eastern Europe in the 15 hundreds, what they're saying, what they're really saying is, you're a racist. Yeah. That's the, that's the subtext. And it goes back to this character assassination in this need to destroy. Um, I often use the example of you. Do you remember when Gawker wrote about Conde Nast as a CFO and outed them?

Speaker 2:          02:21:43       No, I don't know what that story is. So sad story, but it's so on Gawker. This guy wrote this story about, uh, the CFO of Conde Nast. What does that. Conde Nast is like this big conglomerate that owns a bunch of, uh, like, you know, smaller businesses. They're, they're pretty big company. I don't know. I think they, I think they might even be in publishing, stuff like that. Okay. And, uh, so they wrote this story and the entire crux of the story. This guy that. No one, this guy, I think his brother or brother in law with Timothy Geithner. So that's his, that's his claim to fame I guess, but he's just a private citizen that works as a cfo of a big corporation. They write this piece, that outcome as a gay man that he's having or trying to have an affair behind. His wife's back with this guy, all of this stuff just.

Speaker 2:          02:22:29       And I'm like, I read this piece. I'm like, what is the purpose of this? Why? And I'm sure Jamie, if you want to, you can probably find it. I did the why did they write it? I'm clicks, you know, and, and it actually blew up in their faces. People are fucking furious about this because this wasn't yet. So the, there's the uh, the thing, it's like they just out this guy for no reason to steroid his life. Gawker on Thursday evening helped as Grunfeld sex worker, extort the chief financial officer at Conde Nast and brother, a former treasury, treasury secretary, Kim Geitner that has his name. Tim Geithner. Yep. Jensen, ing. Any semblance of journalistic integrity and likely ruining a man's life in the process. I'm telling you, you can go jump down the rabbit hole this read about this guy. This is such an example of outrage of not even.

Speaker 2:          02:23:18       I already told you I've just character assassination for sake to remember this. Now I'm kind of remembering the story. It's almost, it's unfortunate. There's so many fucking crazy stories. So it's, yeah, it says, uh, he is married and has three children allegedly arrange a night with a male escort. On a recent trip to Chicago when the escort found out who the CFO was, he asked for help with an ongoing housing dispute. In other words, trying to kick it to the government because of his connection with Geitner CFO. Allegedly, he got spooked and canceled their meeting, though he paid in full for the, for whatever rendezvous they were going to have in retaliation. The escort went to Gawker, which published the story despite knowing that doing so would play into the extortion attempts. The site also publish screenshots of the pairs, alleged text message exchange, including several photos.

Speaker 2:          02:23:56       They shook this guy down and ruined him, ruined him, ruined you. Probably he's going to have problems with his wife, probably get the forest now. His kids are going to be in limbo. He's gonna lose his job and he's got to follow them around forever. Why? Right. Because he tried to, you know, it's not our business if he's cheating on his wife and it's not our business. If he's gay and it's our business, if he's trying to have him be with a male escort, they saw clickbait. Yup. And this is, and this is what it's all about. It's to say I would even go further with Gawker, which obviously ended up taking him down with Hulk Hogan. It's like, why? Because he's a famous person to his sex tape, which is going to ruin his friendship, ruined his marriage and all of these connections. What kind of pleasure do you get out of that?

Speaker 2:          02:24:32       That goes back to the point I was making about how I wouldn't write stories about a couple people back in the day because I didn't want to ruin them. That's not what I'm out to do and I feel like that. So it all plays into the same culture, the same culture of character assassination, Neil puritanism, witch hunting, enjoying irresponsibility. There's a responsibility that comes with this that there's almost like a power that has not been earned. This the power of whether it's social media, whether it's the ability to write blogs about someone like that or whether it's ability to, uh, just to, to make tweets and just a attack, someone that this, this, this ability is really very, very new and the ability to mass published, like to make a tweet about a guy like you just decide Collin Moriarty is a piece of shit. I can't believe that joke fucking sexist. And then boom, put that out there. And then it gets retweeted over and

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       over again like that. People don't necessarily understand the repercussions of these actions that this is like there, there's, there's an amount of power that they really haven't earned. This amount of power and influence that you, that you have in your ability to express yourself today. That's a really new thing. I look at it a little differently in the sense that. Because I think you're right, I think you're onto something there, but I think it's also the mob mentality that it's, that exposes the fact that say I was ruined forever. Right? And they won whatever that means. And then people go like, hey, you just ruin that guy. Why did you do that? And they'd be like, oh, he did it. Oh, he did it. Oh, he did it. He did. In other words, no one's responsible for it. And when you're, when you're in this mob, it's like, it's like it's, it's old fashioned witch hunting and it's done for strangely puritanical reasons.

Speaker 1:          02:26:11       That's. Do you think that there's also an inclination to do it because you're worried that it's going to happen to you and you want to attack first feel like there's almost a thing where the people want to take the, the, the vision off of themselves or they, they want to take the, the, the scrutiny of themselves point. And when you pointed at someone else enough and you keep pointing at other people, they. I mean eventually people kind of get it after awhile, but like is that a little expression that if you want to look at like the with, with girls, it was always like the girls who would talk shit about other girls being sluts were always the biggest slots. Right. You know, I mean there's this weird thing about people where if you're going after folks and a lot of those sort of situations, what you're trying to do is take some of the eyes off of you.

Speaker 1:          02:26:56       I think that that's probably a huge element of it. I find it strange because I went about my business in a different way for the same reason, if that makes any sense. So it's like I don't want to. You're making the argument, which I think is true that it's like don't pay attention to the man behind the curtain. Like there's all of this stuff over there and my whole thing was like, I don't want to be involved in this, get that, get that. And I believe you that you don't want to be involved in that. And I think that's very virtuous. I think it's very nice that you think the way you do, I think it's important, um, and I think it's important that you, you have this ability to express yourself and let people know that that is a good way to look at the, the least amount of conflict that you can go through life with the better you're going to be off as long as it's in unnecessary conflict.

Speaker 1:          02:27:34       You know, and I think in this situation, this is clearly unnecessary conflict. Yeah. And, and that's the, that's the whole it. And it causes this, this rigorous kind of atmosphere where we can see it in politics to where everyone's mad about everything. Like Donald trump reads everyone's mad. Donald Trump read the day, uh, uh, the, the, the picture that's going around on CNN and where it's like, it was literally like, is Donald Trump afraid of stairs? Was like the Kyron the lower third. And it's like, and it's like stairs and it's like furs elevators. Yeah. He prefers gilded elevators, but that they're, they're serious. Real question. This is, yeah, this is the kind of stuff that's going on. And so when you say s, t a I r or s, t, no, stairs, you walk up and down and down and the ars because it can be like the evil eyes. But uh, to me I'm like, uh, you know, and that's why it goes, you know, the, the fact

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       is, and I think this is an important component to maybe making you understand what happened a little bit better because you're not in the, in that ecosystem, but I think you can relate because you're seeing it happen elsewhere, is that the gaming media is dying and they're dying because no one really trusts or cares. Trust them or cares what they have to say anymore. People. Ten year olds and 15 year olds today are not growing up being like, I wonder what polygon has to say about the newest game. They go to youtube and find a guy there that they trust and believe, which is why the only people unanimously pretty much that came out in my defense where you tubers, because they know that they're the next rung of this evolution of the way we absorb and communicate and absorb information. And have news meanwhile these people to your point or writing, clickbait, trying to stay relevant, but no one really cares what they're saying anyway, so they're in their death throws.

Speaker 2:          02:29:06       This is a way for them to take shots at multiple people at the same time. This is what they did, a Pewdie Pie. This is what they did to other people and put pie. One was really egregious. It was agreed to split. But like again, a lot of that stuff was taken out of context and a lot of auto mean. Pewdiepie always agreed the attacks on him. Oh, it was terrible what Wall Street Journal did to him. This is just the sign of the Times. These are people fighting and I really feel this way and you might disagree, but I feel like a lot of it is these people are fighting for their lives. If I were, if I were a person that was trending up, hold on a journalist. The journalist. Yeah. Yeah. Like if I were. I'm sorry to to interrupt you. If I were right, if I had written in the video game industry for 10 years, right.

Speaker 2:          02:29:43       I wrote the gaming industry for 14 years, but how is a 10 year industry veteran and I had fewer than 10,000 twitter followers and I'm writing for a site. No one reads and I'm trying my hardest to stay relevant and to do my thing. I'd be pretty mad too if I saw a guy that turns on his camera and speaks whatever he wants and gets the amount of views in 30 minutes, then I'll get the entire year. Why would you be men? Because it's nothing to do with you, but what does it has a lot to do with you because there's only so much time and space for these people to absorb things and they'd rather famine mentality. They'd rather go to youtube. Three hundred and $50. Million people in this country alone and there's many, many more people over over the world. The idea that anybody's views is somehow or another taking away from your views.

Speaker 2:          02:30:22       It was just straight famine mentality. Has plenty of eyes to go around and you're showing it right now with your new project. Sure. But I'm just like. But I'm just saying like their. Their thought process sucks. Yeah, and extensively it's actually adding to their destruction because people are looking at this like the media for instance, in political and the political landscape is dying anyway that the decline is happening. Wall Street Journal put up a piece not too long ago saying that per capita of viewership on television is actually starting to be outpaced by youtube. So that's over now. Right. So like now that's not on video online or video on demand. That's just youtube. And so people are looking at the situation and actually precipitated that happening quicker because in order to stay relevant they lie. Are they pieces? I think we should talk about what happened with [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:31:07       Most people are like, who the fuck is put shy and what happened? Sure. Do you want me to send it to you have to do is so pewdie pie is, is the biggest youtuber in the world. He has 55 million subscribers and he's a millionaire. I'm just to be clear, I've never, I don't really know him very well. I think I've had one or two communicates with him at some point, but, um, I don't know. Um, so I don't really have a horse in the race. Uh, he lives in Europe. He lives in England, I think he's Swedish or something of that nature, but he lives in England and he has a massive youtube following me in every video he does. We'll have 10, 12, 15 million views and you know, you're on youtube. I'm on youtube and a much lesser sense that's a lot of use.

Speaker 2:          02:31:43       And he pushed the boundaries in some ways and some tasteless ways as this is right. And the thing that really caught on was that he was using this, this app or this, this, this service called Fiverr, which is this kind of task rabbit kind of thing where it's like you can pay people to do whatever you want, any paid. Some of the things he did were otherwise, but he paid these guys and some country to hold up these, uh, like death to all Jews signs or something like that as part of a joke. Um, and uh, you know, and that's something I think is somewhat tasteless, but he's trying to make a point, whatever point he was trying to make, he's trying to make a point. It was lost on a lot of people and this combined with some other imagery he had been using some kind of fascist or Nazi imagery and some other things that have been going on over the months.

Speaker 2:          02:32:25       I'm sorry, did you want. Oh, you about to say something. I'm sorry. And uh, so eventually the Wall Street Journal caught wind of this Wall Street Journal obviously have a prolific right of center, but still pretty moderate newspaper. Um, and basically went after, been tried to basically tried to destroy him and took a lot of things out of context. Then forced Disney's Disney owns a studio that funds him and all these kinds of things and caused a lot of personal and economic destruction for this. It seems like they intentionally took things out of context too, and they distorted the actual intent of what he was trying to do, especially with telling people to not be Nazis. He was mocking people that were being Nazis and they used that to say, this guy is pretending to be a Nazi. Right. It was a completely dishonest hit piece in the same vein as the conde nast hit the same vein as the whole Cogan head is the same.

Speaker 2:          02:33:12       It's, it's, it's, it's these people, they know the term punching up. They want to punch up and they think they're punching up Wall Street Journal's punching up now on youtube years, but really caused a lot hilarious punching up on a youtuber. That's the way they look at it as not an awareness. It is. This guy's a youtuber. He's a guy by himself. You're punching up to attack him because he's the king because he's the media elite. I mean that's the media elite. I mean it's like an independent reporter attacking the ABC news or something like that. Exactly. And, and to me it was like, it showed a lot of cowardice. It showed a lot of half cocked thinking on there on the Wall Street Journal's part to think that this was going to blow back on them and it showed a level, and I hate using this word because I don't think innately it's necessarily a bad thing because I think it drives you forward, but there's a level of jealousy at play with a lot of these kinds of things that are happening.

Speaker 2:          02:33:56       What you were thinking about before when you were saying that someone who is struggling to get 10,000 views and a story they write is going to look at a guy like this that can do one video where he talks about farts and he makes, you know, his 7 million views or something like that. He makes 15 million a year or whatever and they're met and they don't understand it. And I get that. You know, I look at some people that are famous are some that are, you know, have a platform and I'm like, I don't get this, but I'm not going to like sit here and like rain on their parade. That's their right. They have an audience that's totally fine. Maybe look at yourself and why you don't have an audience. Maybe you look at yourself and realize that you have you been doing this for so long and you're so proud of that.

Speaker 2:          02:34:30       Why isn't anyone listening to you? Could it be you, you know, instead of instead of looking around for people to assassinate, which is what's basically happening here. Uh, I just, I find it's so distasteful. I find it's so destructive. We're at the precipice of a very dangerous time because the, the trust in institutions, no matter where you are now is just lost and a lot of it has to do. And, and uh, that's what I was saying with media precipitating the fall by not telling the truth by not doing the right thing. I think the media in terms of pull it politics for instance, is really rebounding from the fact that they thought Clinton was gonna win. So they thought they can get away with saying and doing anything for that means to an end. The Donna Brazil, for instance, where she was feeding questions to the Clinton campaign is so incredible.

Speaker 2:          02:35:15       So shows such a level of bias and systemic inherent bias. They thought they were going to get away with all of it. Now no one trusts anyone. So when I see all this stuff, I don't know what's going on with Russia and trump for all I know he could be a fucking Manchurian candidate, you know, but I don't believe a word they say, you know, like when I read this about Paul Manafort about Flynn about blah blah blah, blah blah. I'm like, I don't know. You will have about all this other shit. I have no idea what you're talking about. You know, I have to really do my own research. I don't even know who to trust anymore. They did that to themselves and they precipitated their own downfall. More and more people are going on youtube to listen to people like you, to listen to people.

Speaker 2:          02:35:47       Even like Alex Jones. So listen to Dave Rubin to listen to that problem. It is a problem because usually if you listened in to me, well you, it's a problem because you need people in the trenches that you trust. You need someone in the press room at the White House, you need someone in the app that is on the wire, that is telling you the truth, but when you can't even trust them anymore, right? That's a big problem and that's when people go seek out alternative sources of news and information and entertainment and that's what's happening and that's why they're dying.

Speaker 3:          02:36:10       Yeah. Well, in many ways that you sure that big corporate model is in ensuring their own demise.

Speaker 2:          02:36:16       Absolutely, and and it's, it's the race for clicks. It's the race for money. It's the race for prominence. That's the race for relevance

Speaker 3:          02:36:22       and not honesty, not transparency and not a real objective sense of what the truth is and what the actual facts of a story are. That's where journalism is a different thing now because it's now a entertainment show. It's an entertainment show that also has the news in it, but that's why the women are so hot. That's why the women on Fox News are wearing these tiny little dresses and they have beautiful legs and heels on and they're talking about important issues, but they're giving you a little bit an Icandy why?

Speaker 2:          02:36:52       So transparency. What I see, that kind of stuff. I'm like, it was a very attractive woman. I'm sure she knows what she's talking about, but I know why. I know why she sits at the end of the table. I liked when they were, they're aggressive

Speaker 3:          02:36:59       to look Megan Kelly, she's attractive and she's aggressive. She's smart. That's what makes her sexy. Yeah. Talking about, but uh, you know. Yeah. So we're, we're in this, we're in this, we're in this weird space, you know, we're in. This is just very bizarre space. Do you feel like this is like an almost an period in human communication that we're going through this weird growth period where we're, we have this incredible access to information and the ability to spread it like we have now with social media and with youtube and all these different things where anybody can kind of hop in and all of a sudden get a platform like this pd peg guy. Pewdie pie wasn't a star, it wasn't a politician. He wasn't an actor before this. It was just a guy and he connected with people and carved out this path for himself and pretty much anybody can kind of do that now. I mean there's. It's not easy. It's not. If it was easy, everyone would do it, but it is not insurmountable and I wonder what the next stage is in terms of the ability to share information if it's going to change past where it's at now and get to some new level.

Speaker 2:          02:37:59       Yeah, I think. I think you're right in the sense that the Internet specifically had taken off so quickly. The World Wide Web is only 24 years old. The Internet's way older, but the way we communicate with each other now is so different than even use net in the eighties or these kind of university university communications that they had going on in the seventies where they were sharing things with amongst each other. You don't need gatekeepers anymore. There are no gatekeepers. You can go start a youtube channel now, find an audience, gain thousands subscribers, make a lot of money and say what you want, um, and that's scary to the traditional gatekeepers and they don't like it and they're there for the fight against that is so transparent and it's so self serving when I don't, we need a media that we can trust, but I don't think we need the media as it is right now either because the media we have right now is bloated, dishonest Po, a partisan, politically motivated. All of these things that don't really serve a purpose to educating and informing some of the days of cronkite are gone.

Speaker 1:          02:38:52       Well. Doesn't that sort of set the stage for someone to come in and offer a viable alternative? I hope so. There you are calling moriarty. Yeah, that's, that's the idea. It's just in my own way like I don't, I don't have these delusions of grandeur that I'm going to make millions of dollars and have this huge reach already at $39,000 a month. You better cut the shit with this humility stuff. I just, I don't know what you're doing. Know what you're doing. You fuck stop. I've just, I'm just trying to say that I didn't have, I left my

Speaker 2:          02:39:18       making good money. I own, you know, a kind of funny I, I walked away expecting that I was going take a pay cut to do what I really wanted to do and try to do the right thing and uh, it's great that people are responding the way they do. I hope they continue to respond this way because it will allow us to do more,

Speaker 3:          02:39:30       more of it. My advice to you, stop being concerned with that and just do the best of stopped being concerned with being humble about all this and it. So it's definitely gonna drop. It's definitely I'm going to make. I'm not, I'm, I'm not going to be payments. I'm not going to be. Forget about all that nonsense.
