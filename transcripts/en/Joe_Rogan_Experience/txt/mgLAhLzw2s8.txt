Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Don't tell him. Call Four, three, two

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Mli Tom, papa, Joe Rogan and see you buddy. Good to see you cracking. Lacking I Nah, not too much cruising around. We were talking about old body's falling apart. Yeah. Got a stem cell shot in my shoulder that's killing me right now. Yeah, I can tell you're in pain. Oh yeah. One shot. Several in both shoulders and this is not like anything like that. It's like a serious injury, but there've been annoying me lately, so I said fuck it. Let me just go in there. Every time I've done it it's made me feel better. Right. How often do you have to go? I've been doing it like once every six months. Right? Yeah. That's what happened to it. And then it kind of is okay for awhile and yeah. Right. And once every six months seems to keep me in, but it's expensive. So is it not, is not curing whatever it gets his healing it being a moron.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Right. And going back to working out hard. But we were just saying is that soft tissue heals like this is a soft tissue issue. Yeah. Soft tissue is one of the best things for things like stem cells to therapy because you can actually regenerate tissue. Right. And it can heal things where it gets a real problem with my friend Miriam Nakamoto, she brought over those, uh, snacks, those bags of snacks or were there, there was a little snack company. She's a, a, a multiple time world Moitai champion Boy Moy, Tai Muay Thai, Thai boxing, Muay Thai. No, never heard of that. Nope. You're so, if so, uh, what are white? You're white. You're also like a, a non jock. Well, I was a jock my whole life. What would you do? I played a football. Did you? Oh, that's right. I believe football forever and track and a bunch of stuff that you fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Then I stopped. Did you fucking body up at all? Uh, no. Not too bad. My shoulders a little bit. My shoulder's a little, but uh, that's pretty much it. My, my knees, you know, like I run a lot now. I've been running off for the last couple months and uh, what, what brought that on? I just want to be in better shape. Yeah, I want to feel better. I dropped like burn off 17 rounds. Yeah, exactly. I was like, baby, maybe. Yeah. Your face looks thinner, man. Yeah, it looks good. Yeah. That's awesome man. That's a cool thing once you get going, right? Yeah. At that momentum, that's what's up. Well, you know, it's really was up was I was kind of cruising along and just like we lost five pounds. It just kind of like hanging around and then I realized I'm working out like this workout that I'm doing is what?

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       A bit of a warmup when I was an athlete. Right. This wasn't even a been a warm up and I'm like, oh, that was pretty good. And I'm just like, I have to stop being a sissy and try and really push it a little more. Let's get a trainer, Eh, I don't like intimacy. Oh, that's real. Well, you know what else you can do? There's actually apps where you can follow an app and the APP will put you through a workout. Oh yeah, yeah. There's several of them now. They're really good. Oh cool. A bunch of really good ones. I don't have any affiliation with any of them. I'm not naming any of them, but yeah, you can. Um, you can, you can even get a yoga one. You can get a 90 minute yoga one, right. Just do yoga and it talks you through the poses.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       It's great. Yeah. I used to do yoga all the time, but I feel like I've got to, uh, I feel I have to shift into lifting weights again because I've just been dropping now, but I just feel like, you know, a little bit. I don't want to be, I don't want her hands. I don't want to give a guy like at the pool with no arms. You know what I mean? So many people have motivated themselves by going to the beach or the pool with very little clothes on it. I thought about Fox summertime. Fuck. People are gonna know. Yeah, right. Exactly. I reveal my secrets and then we're going to know what disgusts me about, yeah, this is my glass. Look at it. This is my laziness. Luck. This is what I did all winter. This is my poor food choices right here. Luck. This is drinking upper the upper part.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Yeah. This is the part right on the sides. But I really just, but then when I started getting after and being like, don't be such a sissy, like trip workout, try and push it. Then you want it. Then I want it to do it more. Then I got into it. Then I'm like, all right let's go. Now I'm going further and quicker. But uh, this is all been cardio. All Cardio. What about just body weight stuff like you know, I mean it's not a bad idea to start off with body weight. First of all pushups because you haven't really done much like that. And while it's Chin ups, push ups and the body weight squats really don't need much else. He really not really, I've been doing more pushups, density, ferocious workout in with Change Grip pushups, Chin ups, body weight squats. Just to just those things.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       Does that mean I have to get with one of those Chin up bars? It goes in the doorway that get a real one though. Cause those things fall on. People don't know. Ones that hang, folks. Listen to me. Those ones that hang on the door, the door Jamb, I used to work construction. Those fucking things are not designed for you hanging on him. Now I have a little tiny nails and people like me probably installed them and sometimes you don't hit a stud. That little tiny nail is going right into the fucking dry wall and you're hanging that thing over there and it's pulling on that soccer. No. Then I'll messed my shoulder up. I'll beat that fucker's that drill into the side of the door. You know what I'm saying? The ones that they go right in the side, four screws on each side, that'll hold your weight.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       All right. I don't hold your weight. I'll get that. That want to work because it's pulling. You're pulling down on the wood. We, those things are, it's like sitting on the wood, you know those ones that it is a recipe for a broken neck. I feel like that thing was in like every eighties movie. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure they have good ones to do that. I'm sure that, yeah, sure. But you should really check out your fucking moldings. First moldings a pull and I just lay on the ground and do some pushups. Yeah, but real chin up bar man. A real chin up bar is, is, I mean if you just got one in a park, just go to the fucking park. You're outside. They'll a lot of parks have like those bars a little set up so you could do counseling. Yeah. Nobody ever, I'm are no joke.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       Those are great for working out and I know they seem too simple. They seem like, oh ladies with Wesco or for their role, I go to Nautilus. I don't need this. Right, exactly. I do my leg extensions on Nautilus. I got my membership I use once a month. Bodyweight squats seem easy when you do three. Yeah, but when you do a hundred they become very fucking hard. Right. When you get to like 70 and you're like, Holy Shit, you feel that burn baby. And he'd start counting down in tents. I remember doing pushups when we were played football and you would do, you know, 200 who'd be like 200 breaking motto row. No. Break them out and do it in a row. They would, we do like 30 and then split them up and uh, you know, there was a big time workout and now I'm doing like 25 I'm like I'm good for a couple of days.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       It's hard man. It is hard getting anywhere more than 30 pushups. It's like Whoa, shit starts getting crazy. Yeah. It was a lot of pushing. Yeah. To like your body has to be conditioned for that and if it's not, it lets you know you're like dirty arms start shaking. The funniest part is hockey around 19 though, you get to like 1819 like bro, I'm feeling fucking smooth. It's so funny how whatever number you have in your head is where you start to write. If you say I'm doing 20 you start shaking at 18 if you say I'm doing 25 you don't start shaking until 23 you know, what's a real mental thing? You know, it's really fucking cool than are gone. Rogue makes this thing that it's a, it's like a bamboo pole and on the end of the pole you put a rubber straps like a, you know, those, those, uh, bands that you, and then from those bands, you Hank kettlebells off of the bamboo stick.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       Yes. So as you're doing this bench was, I can't push my lift, my right arm up. It's all rain right now. Otherwise I'll show you as you're doing this thing, everything's all wobbly and everything. Super, super wobbly because first of all, the kettle bells hanging from rubber, right. And the, the, the stick is bamboo thing is super wobbly. Right? And as you lift weights with that, it's really good for your stabilizing muscles. Hold an earthquake bar, that's earthquake. Cool. Or there's a version of it. So it's a stabilizing watch the video online or someone will take us offline. Yeah, the earthquake bar. Yeah, that's exactly what the one I have. We have that out there. I'll show it to you afterwards. It's really cool because even lightweight, like if you had to do 70 pounds, like 35 on each side, it's awkward for that. That doesn't look like something you want to use in your house.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       You're going to ruin your floors. Put rubber on the floor. Rubber on the floor. Yup. Rubber over your house so nothing gets ruined. Did you, do you have grandparents who put plastic over the furniture? Oh yeah. My Nana. My Nana and Clifton. New Jersey. Yeah, mine. Mine was in New York. Yeah, they put fucking plastic over the furniture. It was a big deal. You spent a lot of money on that couch. You're going to, it's gonna [inaudible] fuse. When I, a little kid, I'd sit on that couch over like, this is terrible. Especially in the summer with your shorts and your legs. Just be sweating it man. They eventually got kinda like yellowed by the sun and by use faculty. So it was weird. Yeah. It was like, oh, you would like put like a jacket down and then he would sit on your jacket. That whole generation never had comfort.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       Like their beds were hard. The pillows were Shit live through the fucking depression, Matt. Yeah, that's real. That shit. People Starve to death. This was a barbaric time where where people were brought down to, you know, base humanity just rival rough and then you have like, you have like 15 good years and then go into World War II and they dealt with that. So yeah, they were like, we don't need comfort. We're not laying around in our sweatpants on bean bag chairs. Well they knew the importance of being vigilant. Right. Like we all do. You, do you ever, do you follow? I'm David Goggins online. David, do you know what he is? David Goggins is this navy seal who now is more or less uh, uh, like a motivational and a fitness influencer. The Guy who runs broken knees, he's a fucking savage. Yeah, I've seen some of his clips. How many? 100 mile runs that he run in a row. Some fucking preposterous number. I don't want to say cause I can't remember it all. I want to say six or seven. But then it's like 12 or 13 of 100 mile. Remember I don't remember at all. But his whole thing is stay hard. Like he'll send me a text out of nowhere. Like just say stay hard motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       She's out there. Yeah. Cause like first of all, if you're a navy seal, right? This is the pinnacle of hand to hand combat and armed forces. Like those motherfuckers were all special human and then on top of those motherfuckers been all special humans. There's guys that can just, just put a little of that message out like, hey you, you are soft as fuck compared to how people used to be all soft as fuck. Compare it to those World War II people. Those stay, you gotta stay vigilant back then everybody had to stay vigilant. Yeah. Yeah. You had to deal with just day to day life, you have to deal with what was coming from Hitler. What a tune in at a certain time to find out what was happening. Yeah. Everybody had to gather around the TV for the news. That was all the news you got. That's all the news you got.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       You only got an hour's worth. That was it. They just, what the fuck was going on? Nothing. Nothing. And they were better on record and they say, really? What's, I'm so tired of that. They were better off for it. I don't need to know. Not better off for it. Way Better off recognizing that you're luckier than those people having some fucking discipline. Watching a David Goggins Instagram clip and get your fucking shit together top. No, I'm not. I agree with everything you just said. I agree with everything you just said, but I'm saying you're better. They were better off not being fed a news diet 24 hours a day. Mentally, mentally. We're the first human beings that have had to deal with this on slot. It's a double edge sword because if you don't get fed that you don't find out about Julian Assange getting kicked out of the embassy in London.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       You don't find out about a million different stories that are in the news. It's a fun story. It's a cool story, but do I need to know it? It's a fun, that's a quote for you from now on. Hey, what about Julian Assange? Tom Papa, hands up and close. It's a fun story. It's a cool story, but I don't need to know it. Holy Shit. Really. I mean, really, you just redefined white privilege. Well, you hit it, you hit it on the head, lit it on fire. No, it's seriously, what can I do about a lot of these, you know, look, I think it's good that information is flowing and that moves everybody forward. But you know, for me, sitting in there trying to tell some jokes and feed my kids, it's like, do I need to know everything, every trouble spot going around the world. It's like, that is a very good question.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       It's like how much responsibility do you have to be tuned in to all the events of the world and to act like how much responsibility do you have outside of voting and do you have the responsibility to vote? Cause there's some people that are very interesting people that don't vote. Yeah. You know, I don't agree with that. Yeah. It's a, I want to participate. I understand that. Um, but I don't think Michael Mouse votes doesn't, he does it. Didn't he say he doesn't vote? I think he said he doesn't, I forget his reasoning, but it was very logical. No, I understand the argument, but I even, and even if it seems kind of false and I just, I think it kind of like mentally engages you in the world. It's like you should be trying to participate. I think his perspective is that as a commentator on the world, that'd be better off if he didn't actually vote and just look at it how he really sees it on both sides. Right? Partial. Yeah. I'm sure I'm butchering the way he would phrase it. Think it's in the spirit of that. If you vote, you don't have a right to complain.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       All right. Okay. That doesn't even make sense. That doesn't make anything that was deep. Well, but I think, uh, but look, it's, it's a lot. Look, I think it's trying to be a good person. I'm just a person level and try and take care of your family and work hard and be good with people and help your community. That's kind of the extent of what you can do. And hopefully that spreads out. But you know, Julian Assan. Okay, whoa. Really? I mean, why is that, you know? Well, like all those people that we're talking about at that generation that only got news during that six o'clock hour, you know, were they less

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       citizens of the world because they only got that little dose, I don't know. They were less

Speaker 3:          00:14:57       formed. And the idea is that more people can get away with things they shouldn't be able to get away with. Like what's happening right now with Julian Assange, Julian Assange in anybody's estimation, if you look at what he did, he distributed information that was extremely interesting to most people in the world that didn't know about it. Right. Exposed a lot of scary shit. Yeah. He's supposed a lot of corruption as opposed a lot of, um, I mean, what, what corruption did it expose? I know it exposed the, there was that, um, was it a collateral murder video? That was the f one of the first ones where they showed them shooting. They shot at, um, these guys where they thought were soldiers and they were, they were reporters. And it was just sort of just the way they dealt with it. It was very scary for people watching that someone could just like dehumanize accidentally killing the wrong people.

Speaker 3:          00:15:49       I make it like the military, they were the Megan at like, you know, hey, but you kind of have to be in that mindset to be able to gun people down from the sky in the first place. The whole look, you gotta put yourself in the perspective of someone who has to do that job and you take a regular person and then you train them to do that job and then you ask them to go and pull the trigger and people, they're going to develop a coldness to them. Yeah, they have to. Right. But to see it, so with Julian Assange did is he showed it to us and then he released all sorts of, I mean, I, I've, I haven't, I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't really studied all the files and what was released and what wasn't apparently was when Ben Shapiro was here. He said that, uh, people's names got a put out. Apparently that was someone hacked into wikileaks and release that information before they could redact the names. This was the, this is what I've been told by multiple sources. But again, I didn't look into it. I don't know if that was correct.

Speaker 2:          00:16:46       So they're going to say that he was treasonous or that he was,

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       I don't know what they're going to say. I think the first thing was a sex charge. That's what they were trying to say. That he had sex with a woman. Um, they wear shoes, he wore a condom and then they had sex and then they had sex in the morning with no condom and she didn't consent to that, that he just kinda did it or something. I think it was something along, I think they called it Soprise sex and if I'm butchering this, I'm sorry. Um, but the, um, that didn't make sense like that there would be going after him that way.

Speaker 2:          00:17:20       Obviously. Not about that. Yeah. You go after if you want to get somebody to go after him for whatever. I think there's kind of like hacking charges now, right? Yeah. I don't know. I know he's a little crazy in the, in the embassy, right. He, he wouldn't clean up after his cat and he was riding a scooter around. Is that true? That's what I don't know. Who knows what's true. I know that's part of the problem, but that's what's part of the little story that I caught. The Little Duncan was poetically describing what the embassy must have smelled like dirty cat shit

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       wafting through the halls. Yeah. Crazy asshole. Do you have staying here? Won't leave. Pamela Anderson comes over every now and then they get their free con, the surveillance footage of Julian Assan skateboarding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London has been leaked. Okay. Yeah, but here's the thing man. Like what do you want the guy to do? Is there a problem? He's there for seven fucking years now. He must have gotten crazy. I mean, that's like being, you know, under house arrest dude. I mean it's amazing that he lasted that long and what they did, they waited them out and then when it there, we're never going to wait him out. He was gonna stay in there forever. And then I guess got sick of him. They just get sick of him. I think it was also the Ecuadorian president. I think he took a photograph in front of a, like some lobsters and shit and it was from a leaked email in that photo got out and it was very embarrassing to him because his country's in deep financial crisis and he's chilling in some foresees and somewhere he loves tearing lobster.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       Yeah, well I don't know. I mean, look, it's funny that when you see pictures of Trump, he's eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. When you see pictures of this dude, he's, he loves her and Trump phrase Kentucky fried chicken was fucking private jet hilarious. He really loves that stuff. He really, he fucking loves fast food. Like when he got all those athletes, when they came to visit him and the government was shut down and brought them all fast food, he didn't understand it. Like what the fuck this shit. And then he had another team showed up months later and he broke out the fast food again. The government was hope. Just imagine the fucking, you're going to see the president of the United States and you are a professional athlete. Yeah, right. Your body literally is a temple and they were college athletes, but oh, they're college. I would still listen.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       Let's be real about that. Huh? How much athletes should get fucking paid? Crazy. That's the biggest robbery and all of that bled ex college sports to get into the NBA and the NFL, but you're making billions off these kids. Fucking billions. Don't give them a swell. Much money, $20 fucking fast food. I'm telling you, man, this guy, in terms of like material current, it's almost like we glutton doubt. It's almost like Trump was ice cream like when he was in office. He was so good for comedy that it looks like there are so many Trump jokes now. Everyone's like, no mom anymore. I can't take another bite. He's, I need something else. I can't have ice cream. These are one more bite ice creams going to come check it out of your throat. It's really true. It's so, he's so fucking eccentric, like good or bad.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       Just look at him as a human. It's such a rare human. Yeah. You know, I mean you've seen it with the, with the hair and the constant golfing. Even though he shit, he shit on fucking Obama Golfing and he's got way more than him. He doesn't even try to pretend these about a hypocrite. No, he's just everything. He's just the fat American on a jet Ski. Just letting it rip. Curious if you know what's also hilarious. I think this is a real thing. Trump derangement syndrome. I think it's real, but you mean people that are obsessed with him and they're obsessed with, you know, this is the thing that's going to get them. He'll be out of office in three weeks instead of like looking at it like this is the argument for a guy like Michael Mouse that he's an objective analyst. Stepping back, looking at this, he's doesn't, he doesn't have a vested interest in this guy winning or that Cayenne and when, and he's just going, hmm, what is this?

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       Sitting back and watching this is if I'm going to take that position, not emotionally involved because some people get so emotionally involved they can't sleep, they start crying, they think it's the end of the world. The world is exactly the same. We just have a different figure head and I think it would present challenges that will make us more understanding of each other do. That's what I really think. I think there's, there's good and bad about every situation, but the pro I see is communication. If we're just honest with the way we communicate, I think people on the right and people on the left, they share a lot in common. There's a lot, a lot that they share rather than what they don't share in common. The only thing they don't share is what they're watching. How others. Right. And then also the vibe you get like this, the vibe from these, whatever, whether it's CNN, whatever show you're into, MSNBC, Fox News, they all give out a vibe and that vibe is, you know, we are right.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       Here's what's going on. Here's why that's a problem. You know, and everyone has a different problem and everyone thinks they're right and then you have, so you have different things. You, some of them are have like eagles and flags and Tom Fox News. Yeah. I'm into that kind of truth. Gimme gimme that shit. Yeah. Fucking, yeah. Yeah. Come over here the right way. All right guys. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking neighbor. Let him over to you a fucking day, bud. Rachel Maddow trucks and hats and guns and so that becomes your team. That becomes your claim. That's what it is. It's the team thing. Most of it and it, and the, the unfortunate part is both are saying, are spending so much time rather than thinking about this is the problem that we have to deal with. They're spending all their time thinking those other people are assholes. Right, exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       It's being, it's the, the venomous attacks against a fellow Americans because they have a slightly different view about healthcare. That part is the, the derangement of the culture right now. They're not enemies. They're Americans. You know, we're all on team America. Exactly. Greta, this fucking thing in that, bro. Exactly. Those were all together, which I sat the bench. It is a wild country when you travel around and look at my phone, watch this. Then you got the flag blowing in the wind, bro. It moves. I believe in America is a concept. I don't think it's a bad thing to believe in America as a concept where we're getting better. We're, we're working on this. I think this idea that the people were complaining that someone put the American flag on a cop car and a California that shit. Yeah. Like, Hey, this is, we're in America.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       What do you mean they put us rod back and flag on a cop car? Like just draped it over it. No, like they had like the side panel where it says the police department has the American flag incorporated into their logo. Like what do you hate America? What's wrong with that? I like it. Yeah. It's pretty like it. I fucking salute those cars as they drove by on a beach. Yeah. Problem. Who doesn't like the American flag? What's wrong with being a patriot? It's imperialism, man. Everything. It's all the good too. It's all the creativity. All the art, all the love, all the positive people, all the opportunity people. It's amazing. We're one country. Look at this. Oh my God, let's see this fucking quote. We have such an amazing community of artists here and I thought the aesthetic didn't really represent our community. This person said it feels very aggressive.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       Bitch. You're in the winters team, right? Okay. You were in Laguna biatch aggressive and artists and Laguna beach. Just loving life. Marguerite is everyday at four it's aggressive. That's why you can walk around with flip flops. You fucking idiot. It's aggressive. It's not aggressive to you. It's not aggressive policing your friends, the whole, if something happens to your house, who do you want to come near? This water is water color kit or the police, but then not even saying that like the police car, the colors on the car. They're not saying we shouldn't have police saying that flag is too aggressive. It's the flag and the police like that is the flag. Make it more aggressive. That is so stupid. I don't get it, but it's that thought process. It's just something wrong with us. Well there is that there is that knee jerk reaction from people on the far left.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       The thing, everything we do is evil. You know, from the beginning of the country to now we're just corrupt and evil and awful than why you still here now. Why are you going to the arcade? They would all admit that it has great qualities of problems is the problem is when people really focus on only the negative aspects, the negative aspects of this country are real. They're real, of course, some top to bottom in every, in every, in every group of human beings and negative aspects are real. But this group of human beings in a relatively short period of time has this group of human beings has managed to accomplish insane architecture, music, comedy, writing

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       it and dominate the world. I mean it's a crazy fucking weird place, but you dominate the world in a democratic sense, right? With with a democratic election in the, in their country, ladies, mostly peaceful manner. The real problem was, and then you start wondering like what the United States does outside of this country and whether or not they should be doing it. Right. It's like, are they doing this because they have to do this because this is the way the rules work in that country or I mean, why are they propping up this guy when this guy is clearly a dictator? Is it better to have the dictator in charge and have it become a failed state like Libya, all the shit that's way beyond our pay grade. Right, exactly. It gets screwy. You say like, yeah, I don't like what America does overseas. Okay. I don't exactly know what they do and I don't think you do either. No, exactly. I think there's some, until Julius tells us clearly, some people know, right? Some people are super educated, informed. I'm not, I'm not denying that, but what I'm saying is that most of the people that have these really

Speaker 2:          00:27:43       aggressive opinions about these things, yeah, and look, there's don't necessarily think they've thought about it too deeply. No, but you also know that, you know, look, everybody knows the country. Does some dirty stuff in places that wasn't cool, what funds your country doesn't. You're right. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       Wait, the thing things these militaries and these countries have to do in order to keep peace and

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       yeah, and, and, and you know, you want to shine light on that, so maybe it's not done again, but it's, uh, it's, it's part of the thing that we're talking about before about like our grandparents not having a lot of the information in a way that you're living in the dark and that's bad, but in a way, you're living in the light now and you see everything. The problem with seeing everything, I think it kind of is a problem is that you realize that no organization, no country, no government is flawless, no person, they're flawed. Everything is flawed, everything. And now we have this idea that if somebody isn't perfect, they should be just run out of town. Cancel. Yeah. Canceled, kicked out of office, whatever. Yup. We're all flawed. Everybody's flawed. And this idea, because we can find everything else out, you can expose everyone's flaws. What we're going to have to come out of this somehow realizing that flawed doesn't mean that they're evil or they're negative and they have to be kicked out. Do you think there's ever going to be a time in, in humans,

Speaker 3:          00:29:16       like whether it's a hundred years from now or a thousand years now where there's no war?

Speaker 2:          00:29:20       Yes, yes I do. How do you see that happening? Well, it's going to start with cop cars, with flags on them

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       and then they're going to put stroller.

Speaker 2:          00:29:35       I think it would be technology and I think it's a matter of everybody becoming more comfortable if you can, if you can have people, this is like a Thomas Friedman idea that if, if you want to stop like people fighting in the Middle East, uh, give them all the comforts of a good society, let them be able to go eat McDonald's and sit in a coffee shop and all of a sudden you don't want to fight as much. And that means prosperity. That means popping. So I think technology, if you can bring more water to people and there's less suffering, if climate change doesn't turn ruin all of that. I think if you can prop these people up and give all these people if they can rise and there's no sense. I mean we're in a point now where there's fewer wars than ever before on the planet. Sure. So we're headed in that direction. So I don't see why not.

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       Well, as a thought exercise, let's look at it this way. What makes anybody decide to act as a group? What makes anybody like if why would we decide to go? Right? What negotiations should we be having with someone in Germany? Like why, why, why are we having a conversation about anything you live way the fuck over there on the other side of the ocean. What would make people act as a group and go over and try to fuck with somebody else that's, that's in another place like, well, people can be, people can definitely be rallied. All right. For any cause. Most certainly. But do you think this is my thought that there will come a time where that kind of rallying doesn't work, that people will stop believing? I mean this is one of those very bizarre ideas that the systems that we've established for, for human civilizations, whether it's countries or cities or um, uh, continents, right?

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       Whatever it is, these systems, once all the boundaries that kept people from freely traveling, all the, once those are, those all broken down, no country anymore and they keeping this, keeping it together now is the fact that it's air travel. So they know when you're coming in and they get to check your papers, you're flying in from overseas, are you Mister Papa was only one way. Motherfucker, you got to land right here in this spot. And then we take each individual and we say, can I see your paperwork? What do you got? Who are you, where are you from? Where were you born? Do you have money or you're a drug addict. You have been arrested. And then they're allowed. They could still do that that way. If that didn't exist, if it was way easier to go to Germany, there was a technology that would allow you, like a person like you or made the same way we could drive places.

Speaker 3:          00:32:04       We could just fly into somewhere and land anywhere. You don't have to go to a fucking specific location like an airport or get funneled through a road that takes you to some, you know, some checkpoint station, like when you're trying to drive from Mexico. Just if people could fly. Yeah. If people, if people flew anywhere they wanted to go, if that technology existed, good fucking luck keeping people from coming into your city. Good luck. All those rules are out the window, but it does all those immigration rules that doesn't exist anymore. Can't exist. People can go anywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       Right? But what are you saying that gives you, well, the gives you

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       the interaction with human beings like you. You won't be able to get them as a group as easily to go after another group. Right. Because now there's no country basically. There's no like thing to, right. We're not part of this that has to go fight that. Right. We're all in. We're all one now here's the do have one person lives in a great spot and they don't want to give up their oil, right? Right. Then it becomes a problem, right? Come on, resources. We're all in this together. Those people in Alaska, you know they got all that fucking oil, bro. Here's how. Here's two things though. Here's two things of why it might not work. One, still this college, but I only two that I can think of. Okay, let me hear a one.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Italians are Italians and Germans are Germans and Mexicans are Mexicans and you get around your people and you feel it and you know it and I know who you are and we're part of that tribe and we're part of that thing and it doesn't matter that we grew up somewhere. I just know you as an Italian and I'm an Italian and I am with you, and that is very different from that Turkish guy over there. That thing, that very human thing, chemistry thing of your own blood, your own thing. I don't think that's going to go away for Bro. You're old school and you bake bread. I didn't, you're talking nonsense. It's truly things. You're the old timey thing. I do love all the time. He thinks your eyes without glasses. You'd be like, Nah, I liked the class. I put him on and get ready to go to work. But I think that's a real thing. Horse cars and your friend, your friend, you give him, Hey, this shit is actually really good for fertilizer.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       All right, well I'm going to blow your mind with my technology in this conversation, which I just read an article yesterday that in uh, China face recognition is the thing that's going to stop your fantasy of everybody just loving each other and going around in China there with face recognition, they're able to recognize and categorize Muslims in the country. There's like this one sect of Muslim in China and they're with all this face recognition that they're seeing, you know, from your phone, from everything. They're starting to catalog the enemy and they're, and they're going to be able to police or sharing information and hotels and everybody and they're all now through this network. No. What type of person just walked into this building and whether they're friendly or they're the enemy and that thing, that face recognition thing is PR could end up splitting us apart even more old timey. Tommy with his technological facts.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       China's big brother surveillance technology isn't nearly as all seeing as the government wants you to think. This is kind of like a, they might be able to upgrade it though. It says it can't for sure. Yeah. That's one point. Oh, when your phone unlocked with your fingerprint and it blew your mother fucking money, you're like, Bro, it's really, it's my finger, pinky and even worse, my pinkie five fingerprints on this motherfucker. It'd be give consent as I could to do the side of my thumb and it's still knows his glasses. What do you mean with that? As a cop? It's a cop with Google last year. It's got some sort of face recognition thing. It's like that time grows that Tom Cruise movie minority report. What was that real? Yeah. Not Tom Cruise is definitely there. I don't know, but that's, you know, I try to Google glass on once I actually, oh, through a whole UFC Wayans wearing the Google glass.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       How was it filming it, I guess? Um, ah, it wasn't ready. It wasn't ready and I think that's why they haven't upgraded it. Let's hold off because this is not working. It's been a while. It's not new to that Dorky Shit. And people got super uncomfortable when you around them. It's like holy a camera on everybody walking around with a fucking camera everywhere. I think they'll have something eventually, but I have a feeling it'll be something where there's a technology. What were the outside you, you can't see things when the inside you can and then they'll show you images like directly in front of you on the Lens. So like you wear glasses, like your glasses, but it'll show you things right in front of you. Yeah. I got one that I heard that I don't know if I understand and believe that this is real, but I just googled it and I found something that makes it seem like it's so the next version of the VR headsets are supposed to have brain tracking in them and that sounds super, but it's already being implemented and tested.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       You get a knock on your door. Are you thinking about as beaten off? What is wrong with you, man? No, no, no. We, we thought you were a regular person, but you're beating off a hundred times a week. Yeah. You imagine if they wanted to have a talk to you like Mr Papa, you watched 14 hours of pornography this week. Yeah. That seems a lot. Yeah. I think your mother would think that. It seems like, I mean, I don't want to talk to her. Say employers are going to do that. Insurance companies are going to do that and they're going to be able to hold much. You're beating on how much you're beaten off, how much you're working out, how much you're sleeping, whether and what. Look at that to share only good stuff. That's like Google when they said don't be evil. Abandon that. Once you started making money, they fucking paint it right over that side.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       Maybe a little evil. What is evil, man? I mean, what is evil, evil? Schmiegel we're going in that direction. Yeah, man. It's going in that direction and it's all going to some sort of a wearable thing that connects you, but a weird thing that like everywhere you're going there, picking off your face and then you're going to be able to, they're going to know exactly what you are and who you are. Yeah. No, it's a strange, it's strange. Uh, but it, is it any more strange than our lives today in comparison to people that lived in 1920 like we were talking about earlier. This is way weirder. Weightless, super weird way weirder wearing weird town already for sure. You just hope it doesn't get into the hands of people that can really mess with you. Oh yeah. The people with the money put the money and all the control, they are going to be cool with it. Right? Yeah, that'd be great. There'll be all right. Yeah, that'd be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Do you have a Alexa in your house? Yeah, my kids do. My from my one friend is always trying to tell me, just get that out of your house. It's listening to everything that you say and everything that you can do about it in that room.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       I had a question about that. You know, neuro link might be coming on soon or whatever. I was thinking about like if, if it got to the point where like say we all got it and then everyone you knew had it and there's like a thousand people that have it when it hit like a threshold point where you're like, ah, not everybody should have this. We're, we're good at this point right here. How would you ever deny people something like that? The cost, they might be really expensive to know. How would you ever, I know you can't deny people that won't like say if someone's coming up and they want to try it and everyone else has it, that would, that would create a giant problem. That'd be like if you said that with cell phones, too many people have cell phones. We have to stop you no more buying cell phones.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       I know. That's why I sort of think like that. There might become a big problem with that. Why? What is darling? But hold on a second. I don't understand why you think, I just sort of think that if, uh, in the theory that you're going to let it, thousands of people have instant access to the world's knowledge at their fingertips, at a, at a thoughts like instant, that becomes too powerful in the wrong hands and the people that might have at first might see the, the future problems of that. I'm just, what I was wondering, I was thinking way too far. Jamie got high. Yeah. That sounds like you got high and watch superman. She answer. You say it was like, no, that probably won't be a problem or, well, no, I, I can't stop it though. I don't sort. I'm wondering, I don't think that anyone can say that's not going to be a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       Yeah. I don't know. I mean, what is a problem though? It's going to be something. It's going to be a something. Yeah, it's going to change. One has access to all the world's information instantaneously. First of all, colleges are going under sun. That was my first thought was like they're going to fight. That happened fast and that all day until I think they can. But yeah, I just have to be able to, the amount of money that you would make off of something that made everybody super smart. Yeah. There's no way you can imagine if you found out, how ironic would it be if you found out that like Stanford and Harvard are banded together to try to stop this from coming out cause it would kill their business guys together and it was like, you know, just like how college admission scandals going down so great. There was a scandal that all these higher universities had banded together to try to stop this cause he was going to kill the business. Everybody can know everything. We tell them more than everything we tell them I'm going on some college tours already. Jesus Christ. Oh my God, I really makes you think. I'm like, what did I do? They really need this. This is expensive. Oh, do they really need a a degree in all of

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       this? I don't know. It's a weird businessman. It's a total weird business. Don't know why it costs so much. I'll tell you why. Why? Because the administrators are all making bank. Is that what it is? Yeah. It's all the money that's going on. So all these kids, generations are in debt because they have to take these student loans because college is more expensive than ever before. Well, it hasn't changed running the university lead the teachers, it's the administration of these giant universities are making so much money. They're making millions and they keep cranking it out and they keep, keep needing to up the up the rate and then they make money accessible for the students through loans and then they keep feeding themselves. It's horrible. It's a horrible corrupt system. And it's um, it's also subsidized rent. Well, the government will subsidize something. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       How much does the government subsidize private education? Private education. That's, I don't think Hannah. Yeah. Yeah. You got fast. Full on now. Yeah. It's so expensive. I mean, you know, isn't that weird too, there's like state schools, private schools. Yes. They all cost money. Everything costs money. Yeah. Like what is it like to get to like USC? How much is like a semester at USC? 70,000 no, not as a master. A year. A year. Is it 70,000 roughly 70 50 for the year. Yeah. That's like the, that's the, that's the online Google search thing. That's 50 plus room and board plus all the rest of them. If your kid fucks off, yes. Which of course they're going to do. And by the way, to have 50 grand, you need to make like 80 right. Or taxes you to be, how to make 80 grand. Yeah. For a whole year of your kid being in school. Yeah. And if your kid's just doing bongheads totally.

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       My father dropped me off to school at school and I was like a sophomore. It just drove me into, into college and drop off my stuff and I was so psyched to go see my friends and just kind of, you know, just work hard. Be Responsible. Okay. Dad. Okay. Okay. I go running into my, uh, dorm room. My buddies are there. I haven't seen them all break Tom. They hand me a bong. Hey, I light up. As soon as I walk in, buy bags or haven't even trap, I light it with my lighter and this huge flame comes out and almost like lights my fire. I'm like, why? Blah, blah, blah. Hey Papa, your dad's outside. He's in the van. I had forgot something. I forgot a lamp in the van. I go running out there. I'm like, Hey, what's up? You know, hope and I don't smell.

Speaker 2:          00:44:18       He goes, hey, you forgot your, what happened to your eyebrow? Your eyebrows burnt off. What did you do in the two minutes? I just took the lamp. Thanks Dad checks. He's writing checks for me to go and do. Yeah, it's brutal. Jesus. Actually more that was just tuition. I saw, I see 75 $75,000 USC one year room and boards 15 three that's got to be low because that's just about it. Over a thousand a month. It's kind of be a man and that's without like if your kid, if you live on the east coast and you're flying your kid back and forth and all the rest of it, look at personal expense, personal and miscellaneous, 1400 bucks for the year for the hundred bucks a month. Get Out. That's crazy. Yet it, forget it. The books, they're going to be way more than a hundred bucks a month to the books are going to be 1200 a semester.

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       Probably. You should go to state school. You pay a quarter of that. Stay in, get your undergrad. Things like you could have a nonsense education like me. Well you just read things that you're interested in and then you never get like a real base education. I don't have a degree in anything. He didn't go to college. I went to college, but I fucked off. I barely paid attention. I went to Umass Boston, so yeah, that's when my sister went. I didn't even take my sats. No, really? No. There was like a, they had like a continuing education program and you just sign up and start taking classes there. Oh Nice. Did you go the whole way? No, I went for three years. I was barely paying attention three years I did it. I guess I realized I was doing it a little bit while it was still doing standup, like while I started doing stand up.

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       Uh, it was, it was literally only so that people didn't think I was a loser. Right. I just wanted to let people know I'm doing something I didn't pay attention at all. Right. I will. All I was thinking about was a martial arts competition and then it was stand up. Well, yeah, the transition right there. Yeah. Once that happens, forget it. And once I realized that people made money doing standup, that's when I quit. It depends on what you want to go do. Like there's certain you want to go in law or you want to do certain, you know, Madison, there's certain routes where you need a degree. We really need a degree and there's definitely something good to going to school and being around other people from around the country and all kind of thinking for sure. It's all positive, but you should not go into debt.

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       I have all these nephews that they got out of school, $30,000 in debt. Right? This is the start of your life as an adult. The worst 30,000 in debt. They can't keep up with the payments so that and the interest kicks in and after four years, now they owe 50,000 and they're constantly chasing it and now they ask their parents to help them out and they co sign now you have two generations and they've got to pay taxes. Right. And, and they're now on their second job where no one cares anymore. Where you went to school, they never even asked the question. They don't know. Not, not an s now. No. In certain places. Yeah. In certain routes. Really depends on what you're trying to do. Right? You've got to be a doctor. Think they care. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       I think they care. Oh yeah. Well maybe it depends what kind of doctor. There's a lot of that. Just a professor you probably applying for jobs, a history professor. I went to television production, whatever, and no one gives a shit. Well that's true. If you're going to do Hollywood type jobs. Yeah. Nobody gives a fuck. No. Go working in construction. You can do what my whole thing is, and I keep trying to say this is my daughter, is that you should never don't jeopardize your future for this degree. You can get degrees, there'll be important. They'll help you, but you should not strap yourself with debt. That's why the advice. Yeah, very wise advice and she's like, how about you work harder and just pay for it and I won't have to be in debt. That's a good thing for her to say. Yeah, it's clever.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       Very smart to set you up and my other daughter, I'm just going to give her head shots. $300 a head shots right in the business. The business done that old show business. Hey, everybody's crazy. But I thought showbiz people crazy. Everyone's crazy. Every girl crazy. I'm crazy. Yeah. The people who you think insurance salesmen, people are fucking crazy. They just better at hiding it all day. Yeah. That's what they're doing. They, that's what they do. They hide it. They hide it all fucking day. If you were really smart, he'd just go into plumbing. Listen, there's not a lot of plumbers out there need plumbing. Yeah. And you make a really good living at it and there's not a lot of people that are learning these skills anymore. That's what you should go do or do something you really want to do. Find something you really want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       Yeah. Maybe you don't want to be a plumber should be a requirement that they know what they want to do before they go into college now. But to see what college should be is education would, it really seems to be more, it's like prepping you for the job for us. You know what I mean? There's education as well, but it's prepping you for the job force and nowadays at least in a certain segment of the population, you're, you're getting these colleges that are also like socially indoctrinating kids, socialist ideas and a lot of ideas that you know, just are contrary to what probably their parents taught them. So then there's this internal dispute and who's right and who's wrong and do I rebel against my parents? Both full social justice warrior. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Join the young Republicans on campus and the El kids are just trying to find who they are.

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       Yeah, there's definitely when you walk onto these campuses, even just to tour them, which I never did when I was, I just picked one out and went, but you go in the personality of each university is so dominant. As soon as you walk onto the campus and went to some small, uh, really left liberal arts schools and you just feel like the posters and everything, you're just like as a, as a white male, you're not welcoming at all. And then you go to some other places and it's just kind of free flowing and everybody's just, it's into this, they're just all about the football team. Have you ever seen a poster? It says I as a white male, you're not welcome here. Yeah. Where in my daughter's room.

Speaker 1:          00:50:41       That's hilarious. No, but you know, you like, it's like very, very progressive and very, you know, every, everything is an issue and that's where you develop those ideas. But what I'm saying is you can really learn from going on these campuses like, oh, this is, well, there's a vibe. You get indoctrinated, indoctrinated into whatever vibe the campus holds. You get social points for like following those ideas as hardcore as you can. It's ready. It's really interesting. Yeah. If you take yourself out of whichever way you lean, if you lean left, you can say, well, it's because they're young and they're passionate and they're right. Right. He'll lean right like God, they're babies and they're being taught by people who never made it in the real world. The only just in academia and, yeah, but just look at instead of looking at it like that, look at it where you don't have a fucking dog in the fight and just step back and go, this is fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       It's like people are just trying to change an influence, people's thinking and behavior and some of it is to justify their, their own thinking and behavior. Some of it is because some people just like controlling people, like getting people to listen to them, and some of it is because they genuinely think that this is for the best for the human race and it's all these things are competing together. That's why you have some people that are activists and you meet them. They're not annoying at all. You're like, God damn, you were really cool because they're doing it with the right heart, right? Yeah. Yeah. Of activists that are so annoying, so annoying because they're not doing it for the right reasons. They're nailing it to try to change people because they want to poke you. They want to, they want to have a reason to be upset at you because you're not listening to them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       You're not following their ideas, them and there. Those are the key words. It's about them, them and their status and their power over you and yeah. No, I know there's a couple of people, you know, there's a couple of people I know that have gotten that way so hard that you can't even have conversations with them on both sides. It doesn't help. It doesn't, all it does is create more, more conflict. Like that can of combative attitude creates more conflict. You can be right on every single issue. What if you're super, super combative all the time that people just don't, they don't want to communicate with you and they're now willing to enter into an honest exchange with you. Cause it's always a contest. There's a battle going on, right? And you always think you're right, right? It's US versus the, and they're just looking for little clues and see where you're at.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       And if you give them any kind of hint that you might lean one way, they just pounce on you and it's brutal. It's like this, it's a horrible way to live. And they're angry. They're just angry. They just walk around with his anger. It's like get an ice cream cone. Enjoy your life a little bit. Like what are your core Dodgers fans? That's what they are core sports fans for. The Democrats, like our fucking team's going to kick their fucking ass in 2020 Trump's going down. Right, exactly. It's really bad. It really is that, hey, did you see tiger yesterday? Today? I was watching it while we were in Georgia. We were in Georgia for the UFC and I had a comedy show out there and we were me and um, Santino or watching it on the screen. Uh, on Saturday or yesterday. We watched it Friday or was it Friday or Saturday?

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       Saturday. So Friday, Saturday in anyone yesterday. Well, whatever days it was, right. I think we watched it two days in a row. It was in the gym every day we were there, but then I got home and I saw it on my phone. I was like, Holy Shit. I don't even give a fuck about golf. I know I'm going to speak powerful. I made a comeback, a huge comeback with that. I mean, that's amazing. Seven years later, oh my God, somebody's put on Instagram. One of my quotes. Oh yeah. That I attached to that. It was pretty cool that I love a guy get like, I love, what did I say? I love a success story, but even more than that, I love a guy, fucks his life up and then gets it back together again. Story. It's the greatest, it's the greatest. When you realize how much of us good it must feel to that guy of top of the world again.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       And then he like, yeah, it was so messed up in the back problems and troubles and the kids and the wife and the thing and he just 11 years. Yup. And he didn't stop working. He just went to work and went to work and went to where he is it 11 years later. And so he won major championship recently. Right? Did anyone win one? It was a big deal. He won a major championship within the last, it wasn't a manager, but it was, it wasn't a major this, this was the first major. He's one in 11 years. Okay. So the other one wasn't a major, but it was a big event. It was a big tournament. He wins that whenever I was like, wow, he might be back. He can, he can fucking win big tournament's again. And then he just, Oh, it was so cool to see the crowd just kept building over the weekend and by yesterday it was massive.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       Thousands of people around the green just hanging on him. Oh, the relief that you saw just coming out of him was so great. And then at the end like he walks off where as a kid he was only like 21 when he went in the first time hugging his dad at the edge. And now he comes off 11 years later all this time. And His dad's passed and he's hugging his child, his son now he's the father in the same spot. Oh, it was just, I was trying not to cry the whole time. Oh, it was such a tear jerker what relief. People were just so happy for him. Wow. Such a great story. We do love a comeback to why not man, you love a comeback. We, we're all flawed like you were saying before. But yeah, man, being able to improve. That's what that guy did.

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       He sit down and in pre improved. Amazing. Improved his life. Yeah. And never stopped. Yeah. It went south and he picked it right back up. Brought it north again. Yeah. 11 years of doing it and failing, failing and failing. Is that beautiful? It is beautiful. Such a cool thing. Yeah. I was wondering like he wears that red shirt, he's got to wear the red on Sunday. It's like his, that's his thing. That's his thing. And he was in the light colors on a Saturday and I was like, does he just like free himself from that or is that a superstition that you got to kind of hang on to? Good question. Yeah. You know, what do you think would happen if there was an openly gay black guy with blonde hair who only wore pink, who was like the best golfer a lot. It started dominating some dude who's like super duper gangs and he's just got this fucking crazy drive and, and he gets down on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       He could see the way the, the earth is rolling and the whole time he's doing, he's like lists bit snapping, his fingers wiggling and, but you know, I pop pretty, what would happen if he started just winning? They would probably poisoned them. You think they would poison him like a super flamboyant gay guy who was willing. Okay. Black or white, they would poison them. So what do you don't think so? I don't think so because golfers are so close to flamboyantly queeny gay. Anyway, look at their outfits. They're all pink and like, Oh my God. Big Plaid pants. They're like a bunch of old white dudes, straight white dudes who want to be gay. But it's all this country club life. Right? The big part of it. Yeah, but she had to have that guy swishing around back and forth in the locker room. Snapping his fingers.

Speaker 1:          00:57:50       Staring at Dicks. No, no, no, no. They're going to, he's putting, he's gotta, he's gotta catch phrase hair shaved except for a curly manbun. It just pop straight up and it's blonde and he wears lipstick and he's a motherfucker at golf. He's just killing fools. Does love my irons. Maybe it would maybe would open golf up to everybody else. Yeah. What happened? Like do you think that tiger woods, tiger woods, he opened up golf for people of Color, right? Clearly we got into it because of and how many, how many people got into golf. There would've never even thought about playing golf. For sure. Tiger could play. Started opening up to inner city schools. We're starting to get involved in it. What about the gay community? Are they represented in professional golf? Flamboyant dress like the BGS and the 70s they're close, Joe. They're wearing plaid pants.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       They're wearing, they're wearing tassels. You xenophobia. That's how people from Scotland Trust saying, I was just saying they would, they would be embraced. You know, Scotland's a weird place. Like you have to dress a certain way when you hunt there or at least they have a certain way. They dress like a traditional way. I like that, but it's not like they don't wear Cammo. It's like an outfit. Yeah. It's like an outfit. Like what are they were they were like close, weird old timey clothes. I like that. I like tradition. Um, yeah, I know you did. That's why I brought it up. Bordain went hunting in Scotland who's television show, right? He had to wear some crazy ass outfit. Right. You get suited for this outfit. That's traditional hunting outfit. It's pretty cool. A lot of those, but it's, it's, it's, it's true. Chicago. Those places like Scotland too.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       If I'm in, I think most of it was like private land. Right. I think back in the day like that was what Robin Hood was all about. Right. Robin Hood was originally supposed to be about someone who was poaching and hunting on the king's land because they were hungry and so they were stealing from the rich to feed the poor gentlemanly pursuit, hunting and shooting a tire. Wow. How they dress. Does that help you? Helps me be a good hunter cause aren't get to goof on them or does it like does that help? Does that get in the way of hunting or is that help hunting, but that's how I help and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       I'm tired of as a kind of fresh though. Go back to his boots. Yeah man, that guy looks at his boots. Can you make them boots larger? Look at those fresh boots. I wear those on stage. Would I get in trouble for cultural appropriation wearing someone's stuff if they're white too. I was at work and know that if they're more powerful than you, then you're okay. Like how does that work? How does that work? You can't take from how much, what percentage of native American do you have to have in you to wear moccasins? Who a lot. The castle jacket. How about the, like the Suede tasseled jacket? I, but they're like Roger Daltrey rebels in the 70s war. I wanted one of those so bad when I was in high school. They look so cool. The easy rider with the fringe on it. It's all moving.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       Driving, man. I wanted that arm out the window of the car and it's flopping around. You're on stage singing. The ladies must love you. Oh, Gloria [inaudible] strips a leather. See you. But that goes too far. See how it's because they have the native American thing on the sleeve. This one right here? No, not that other one. Well that one. Yeah, it's too far to that one. If you do that one, you better kill the bear that you used for those fuckers. Yeah, that's too, that's ridiculous. There's a white guy version of that, which would be okay. That's a girl claims to be a healer. Yeah. That's where that, see if you were that in Texas, you're okay?

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       Yeah. Okay. Daniel Boone. Yeah, I'm here with that one. That one's dark. Dark one. Now what do you prince and you're like, that guy. What do you a trapper that's too light. Bat looks terrible. That guy looks terrible. He's got the fringe of the bottom. That's what's going to separate us from else the curtain and on the bottom or fringe. A Nice Kurt and then a fine. A fine restaurant. We'll get Elvis. Elvis had tassels. Elvis had rainbow tassels. You could get away with it if you're Elvis, if you, if you're working for enterprise, rent a car, I think you may be here. You don't wear that. Elvis got away with some wild shit. Who the fuck we'll jumpsuits before Elvis jumpsuits. It was him and evil Knievel. Okay. Oh Man, look at that Hendrix. Oh my God. That's, yeah. See, but he's doing something. He's playing the guitar, he's moving around.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       He's got a headband. If you just, if you're making snow cones, you don't, that's not your jacket, man. I wanted one when I was in high school. I warm up a little bit. Never put that back up. Put that picture back up. Look at that. That look, how good does it look and I could never wear, he's got Fred Gianna yet. What does that greenish yellow, how would you describe that color? It's like a teal, like a light teal light teal. He's got, he's got bell bottoms, bell bottom jeans, washed bell bottoms, and he's got this cool jacket with fringes that are literally two feet long and then a headband to, and it's just his kind of Fuchsia. The had been right. It's kind of reddish, like a light red and he's, it's on Jimi Hendrix. That's the, that's the thing that we can't match when we could buy all those items, but it's still our head.

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       Jimi Hendrix, knowing that it's 2019 to back then, like he was in the groove man. Oh Man. He was the, yeah. Phil Hartman saw him live when he was a young kid. Phil was like 18 years old. He got a job at the whiskey and his job was, you know how they have those giant monitors on the stage and sometimes those things would fall like into the crowd. Who Cheats? Like especially if someone's standing on that are doing a show. So they're kind of, they're a little wobbly. So standing right there. So his job was to stand right by the stage, like literally have his hands like ready to catch these speakers. This was Phil's job. Yes. And Hendrix is right there. Hendrick is right there and he's 18 oh man. Oh my God. Right in front of them. Let the thing just all seeing the same Christ sign of them. Geez Louise.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       Kiss the sky. I was that close to blues traveler once. I don't think that's the same. And this will his harmonica in his past shortly before Jimi Hendrix died. Oh really? Yeah. Oh well he died when he was died in like he was the magic age. Right? 35 was it? It's 20 everyone. The Magic Age is 27 it's an all time or Marsha anise. Isn't that the magic age? Didn't he? Where did he 27. Wow. Yeah. What year did he die? Was it 69 70 70 1970. So Phil, you know, that's amazing. I feel it was probably like 17 years old or something like that. God, fuck. That's amazing. Yeah. Did he ever do one of those fringe jackets? I don't know. I didn't ask that. But the way you describe it, man, it was way he

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       described. It was like running into Jesus while you're out on a hike. Oh yeah. It was crazy. Well, Phil was a musician too, so when you know he talk about it. We can, I like this crazy clean too is hot cheese.

Speaker 2:          01:05:33       It was right fucking there. Right there. Yeah. Come on. Don't, don't Hendricks please. I wanted a, I wanted one of those fringe jackets when I was in high school, so I played football until I was a senior. And then when once football season's over, I have a half a year left of school and uh, that's when I smoked weed for the first time and started playing guitar and I want to win a fringe jackets. I didn't have him, but I did get a pair of moccasins for a little while. I wore moccasins. Did they have beads? They did not have beads, but they had the little French, a little tassels. They were like, it was just a little fringe. Yeah. No soul. What's the purpose of French like? That's like when you think of a trapper jacket, right? When I'm Dan Boone. Davy Crockett type dudes style. Give him wearing that style is really, yeah. Why would they have any style back then? Everybody's got style back then it seems like they were just trying to stay alive. Yeah, the weak ones, but the cool ones are still trying to get laid. I think Daniel Boone wasn't trying to work it a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:06:32       Look at this. Buck skins are often trimmed with a fringe originally a functional detail to allow the garment to shed rain and to drive faster when wet. Because the fringe acid, a series of wix to disperse the water or quills. Interesting. Oh Wow. Buckskins derived from hears can clothing worn by native Americans. Oh Wow. How about that? That's genius. Smarter than you now. So it hangs down and the water goes through all the tissue in the deer and gets to the bottom. So those little things get wet. But the thing that you're wearing, the touches your skin is dry. You would think by now that deer would have had fringe on their outfits. I think the don't give a fuck. You're a really hot or that your body temperature is much higher than ours. Oh, really? That's one of the weirder things about, um, when you put your hands on one inside of them, they're really hot. Like if you're like 98 degrees, what do they like? I don't know. I would, if I had a cast, I'd say it's, it's more than a hundred. I would say that. Yeah, I bet they're probably like 105, something like that. What is it?

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       What's the lot of temperature? It brought up the cooking temperature.

Speaker 2:          01:07:44       350 degrees. They're cooking before we even catch them. It's hilarious. That's why people love deer. You don't have to cook them. Precooked they're preheated same as most undulates, which is 37.5 to 38.5 degrees Celsius, which, which we don't understand. I'll just type in pre heated dear me. 38.5 degrees Celsius. What do you think that is? If you had to guess, I don't have a clue. What was the, what was the number 38 degrees? Oh, that's 105 is it? No, it's like 90 99.5 to a hundred. Right. In that same region like us one or to hire someone with a little bit of fever. Oh, I did something that you would, you would enjoy. You might have even done this. Speaking of body heat, uh, I was in San Francisco last weekend, really performing and uh, I was working with my friend, uh, Kira Sultana Bitch, very funny comedian. She kicks ass.

Speaker 2:          01:08:43       She's Russian. She grew up up there and she brought me to a Russian like bath house beat you up. Sticks? Yeah. Did you ever do that? They call it Banya Banya man. Oh Man. You go into a sauna, a two level sauna, so it's even hotter like up at the top, like an attic in a sauna, super hot. And you lay down on this bench and they take these bushes, he sticks and they were, they wet them and then they start beating you with them. Not a lot of pressure. It's too, it's so hot. It, you're in a sauna, you're already like, really? Really. And then that thing, that thing is hot too and that thing's hot. And with the, with the steam coming off of the branches, as they're beating your back, it creates a little, a little pocket that gets even hotter. So it just brings your body to this super high temperature they're making and making whether they really are anyway and uh, yeah, for about 15 minutes and you come out of there and just feel to jump in the cold afterwards.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       Yeah. Into a cold plunge all the way under this really cold water. Amazing. Yeah. The Russians really let that fade or a million inco. It was like a one of the greatest heavyweights. If not the greatest heavyweight of all time. One of the things that you'd see about his training, what does it was that it was very old school. Russian, like there's a lot of stuff on the parking or in a, um, uh, a playground just like they did a lot of stuff on a playground and um, he incorporated the Banjara that was part of it and like he's, you see him lying there and they're beating him with sticks. There you go. Yeah. You don't show time. So there, yeah, that's what, yeah, they figured something out. You know, all the pretty great invented sauna. They figured something out. There's something about that extreme temperature that just, it, it's very good for your, your ability to recuperate.

Speaker 2:          01:10:34       You feel better. It reduces inflammation. I felt great. Like I went in there, I've been traveling so hard over the last couple of months have just been knotted up. I've just been like, I was like, maybe I'll do this and then get a massage after. Cause that'll really, the gentleman, he like a gentleman and we didn't have time. She had to go. She was driving me. She had to go do something. So we only had time for that part. When I came out of the, the, the Banya or Banya, I didn't need a massage. Everything was relaxed. Everything had changed in just like 15 minutes. It was great, man. I wish it was a, I don't know if there's, they have them in la or not, but I'd like to seek

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       them out. They know they have them in New York. One in West Hollywood. There is, yeah. Voda spa or something like that. Yeah. There you go bro. A lot of dongs keep you bit pants with a lot of dogs. Clothing was optional. Hey, clothing optional. And I'm with Kira, you know, we're like coworkers and she's wearing nothing. She's her. She's totally naked. And then there's dogs everywhere. There's dogs everywhere. He's the dogs. She sees the dogs. I see the downloads. We were the only ones covered up. Where was he going? Dong skip stare in America. What's that in America. You can you do this? Yeah. San Francisco. You sure? Yeah. Girls. He was walking in a room with dogs. They were naked. The girls are naked. And I are the only ones with clothes on because we worked with each other. Send in immigration, send IC alert. Yeah. There's something going on that Bro. It's just dicks everywhere. Open that door. You, you cool with decks in front of you? I'm not. I was here. I was looking away. Cops just come in and fucking masks on Madonna alert. Yeah, they throw one of those. What are those? Uh, gas canisters that flash bangs.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       Just grabbing guys by their dogs. Pulling them out until the paddy wagon. It would all run out. Grab there. Dot. That's the first thing you've got to grab. Someone throws a tear gas canister to explodes in a room. I'm wearing pants so I was the only one with pants on. And you can kind of feel like everyone was looking at you like you're making us feel like shamed because you're wearing pants when it's just taking them off. But I couldn't, I'm with my po. That's a tactic. That's what that is. That's a tactic. Yeah. What kind of, what do you mean? It's a tactic they're trying to like, come on man. Shows your Dick. This is how you show up when you did. You get together with five of your buddies and you all are real comfortable with seeing each other's dicks. We're going to get to see Mikey's Dick.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       How are you gonna do that? We're going to shame them. I'm going to shame them in and showing us his dick and we're going to take our dicks out. We're going to walk into that steam room. I just going to let your nuts hang. Why does everyone want to see what the fuck are you doing with your, but take your God damn pants off and he'll be like go road or road. Jesus. Why does everyone want to see Mikey so bad? Cause Mike, he probably has a little Dick, which dance on? That's, that's what I felt like. I felt like everybody thinks I have a small one because I got my pants up, but that's not it. Um, purely for research purposes. I was a online the other night googling into Dick Surgery, Dick and large and surgery. It was after that billionaire guy actually died. What? Yeah, he was a diamond dealer. He was in his sixties and I want to say he was, I dunno, it was in Europe or somewhere. Anyway, homeboy got some Dick Surgery. Lans died on the operating table. Wow. I didn't even know they're doing that. She surgery. You don't, you don't let me, my grandmother had a saying don't let anyone mess with your eyes or your Dick. Yeah, there it is. He Goes, uh, the gentlemen had been hug. Where you going? Um, he a heart attack in the middle

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       of the procedure, which isn't Fda approved and then says, is it safe? Dunton I think anytime you go under it's not 100% safe and hey, anytime putting you under and cutting you open. I went under for the first time last month. It was an anesthetic, death souls from the anesthetic. That's what I'm saying. They put you wonder men, you could fucking die. I know. I was worried about it and he's an older fellow. I think that guy was in his sixties includes surgical lengthening, which involves cutting a ligament. Hey, at the base of the penis or filler injections. I'll go with filler. Let's see what you do with filler first and then if I'm going to cut my deck later, stage two, they're gonna use a filler. Cocky, foamy spray into the insulation and they come through the asshole. What does this implant for men? Ah, Jeez.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       Ooh. All clicked. I don't know. Fall into, hold on. Hold on. You're going to shove plastic and your Dick. Is that what that guy has? Yeah, like a sling. Hold on. I'll go low. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop scrolling. Get off this page animation, but no, no. Look at this thing you have. You can pick your size. It's a sleeve. It's like a sleeve. You didn't show that Dick on TV or on us. Just for you guys. Well then pull it up, bro. Work they, they can stick the extra long. What if you're like, oh my God. Oh my God, this is so bad, but we're looks like an gutter. A Shin. It looks like a little piece of gutter. A small incision is made just above the base of the penis where your pubes are and the, okay. Then they slide it down into your shaft.

Speaker 3:          01:15:47       I got, I got one word for everybody. What is it? Infection. Ah, what have you got? A Dick Infection. Oh my God. I have one word for you. Popular to think that works. Implanted, secure. Now hidden sutures, which are generally not detectable by a patient or whatever. So you have like this sleeve inside the skin. I'll tell you what's going on now though, in porn. This is some real shit they, they have, they have GMOs only takes an hour. There's Gmo Dick's now you're way bigger. I was watching that old porn film with a John Hayes when we were kids. John Holmes was the guy with the biggest debt. John Holmes has irregular Dick compared to porn stars for real especially, and this sounds racist. Black eyes. Well of course this is in the right direction though. I supplied to the day that it was like, that can't be real. That literally can't be real. His Dick was so big. It was preposterous. He probably had an 18 inch dick 1818 inch deck. It was so, and it was thick around as your fucking risk. It was ridiculous. There was a girl who was trying to suck on it. I was like, see, I don't think the girls want that. Girls like this. I mean, I don't know, maybe the girl was 50 pounds. I don't think she, even if she was, he still had a 12 inch dick gigantic. It was so ridiculously big that as was watching this film,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       I was like, okay, what's happened over the last 2030 years with porn that we've evolved? Yeah. He just got a lot of guys that have a, in the recruitment that, yeah, I guess, right. The perception of what a Dick was from like, yeah, here's what I'm saying. Like there's this implant that may or may not work that we just watched that little commercial for and it's brutal. Yeah. But outside of that, yeah. What would, cause like a girl of girls wanted bigger boobs. They get a boob job. That's common. Yeah. We're used to that. But guys with giant Dicks, I don't think they're getting operations. I think just these are just a crop of dudes with giant takes. You know, a new class of guys showed up. They're on another level through Leah dicks are so big. This recruiting and the fuck. We've had a real great draft this year.

Speaker 1:          01:18:02       It's different. It's like people, the big Dick dudes from like the 1970s and eighties they had kids with people ate a lot of vitamins. Maybe it was an optical illusion because we had more pubes back then. It was coming out of the forest. You didn't see half of no, no, no, no, no, no. This guy was, these guys are massive. Kind of had a snake. Yeah. It was a snake. It was a fat snake that you would like capture in the everglades. This is why I kept my pants on at the Banya. I didn't want people intimidate. If you've got a dick like that, you just swing that thing anywhere you want. Whenever you want. It cares. Who Cares? Well, anyway, I shared this black white dudes that have giant dicks too. I just, there's a couple. I'm not seeing them. I'm not seeing him at the same with the same. I'm just being honest. The limited amount of research that I've done is there is a difference for I think what your defense mechanism was, right? Like rightly to say. Yeah, women don't want that. They don't want their giant Dick. That hurts him every time I get it, bro. Come on. I know where you're coming from. You know I want my ladies to be happy, not upset. Some girls want to be upset.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       That guy, by the way, billionaire in his sixties and even thinking about it stored, why are you even these board? Isn't that amazing? Like if you've got that much money's top and think about that, you're in your sixties you got that much money, you have billions of dollars and how much time do you have left and what do you do with your money and what do you do with your time? You know the good dudes probably fucking board of Shit we owe. Has it come down to sex? Why not just get a hobby? You're so old. Timing. Each injection of hyaluronic acid fillers cost between 250 and $750 and adds girth. Ro said person. Patients usually begin with about 10, 10 injections, injection filler injection. Woo. Wow. Jesus Christ. That's not good. The patient could have given him general anesthesia, which may be exacerbated heart conditions.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Oh, Jesus Christ. Scad heart. He had a heart condition. This guy. Yeah. See they live at, you know what? Hold on. Put that back on. It says, if you're getting general anesthesia and you have an underlying malady in your heart, you will unmask that and it will show itself.

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       Jesus. People are so bored. So all this money and it just makes you more board.

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       Yeah. Ridiculous. I think people just get on a path. Right? And what is the path? The Path is to, to acquire success. Yeah. And when you're doing something like selling diamonds, you know, congratulations for making a lot of money. People like to buy diamonds, but what are you doing? What are you doing? Those diamonds? And you're buying diamonds, you're selling diamonds, you're buying diamond, and you're getting older and you're, you're, you're like, oh my God, I'm at the end of the ride. When am I doing? What was this right about? Um, I'm not dexilant figured out, fuck Aa and one. Then we're going in, we're going to take anesthesia, we're going to get a dick fixed.

Speaker 2:          01:21:02       But because he was just essentially moving money around, he wasn't making something easy. You think that's it? That there was no worth to what he was doing? I think just like he wasn't being satisfied mentally with his job, with his work. With his life.

Speaker 3:          01:21:18       Yeah. I think there's probably a lot of people in his sort of position. A lot of people who are billionaires who are financier's and bankers and stuff where they're probably in a similar spot where they're like, what do what? Unless they have something they really enjoy doing outside of work, you know, it really captivates their time and that's their passion. That's the case. Brow. You're 65 get out. Yeah. Get out of the work. Yes. Stops that. Just get a different hot. Wow. What are you doing? Yeah, but, but the other thing is when you're around people like that, right? And this is not a bad thing. It's a life choice. But if you're around philosophy people, if you're a person who likes Rolls Royces and giant mansions and you know you liked a baller, I've got a big fat diamond ring lifestyle that guys around those people, because he's selling diamond rings, selling diamonds, diamonds. Mother fucker got billions for $48 million. Ooh, look at that blue, a blue diamond, 48 48 million has a father bought it for his daughter. Wow. Magic rock. Damn. Imagine if you're the daughter and you lose that Shit, you're out drinking. You know you, you're fucking pull your panties down the P and a curb cause you're so god. I'm so fucking Hammond. And I rang, my dad's going to kill slips right off while you're throwing up, throwing up in a dumpster,

Speaker 2:          01:22:43       uh, my dad's going to kill me. Yeah, maybe the daughter was 40. It makes you realize that the things that you read that really give you worth in life is not the Joe. It's something that's going to engage your head and make you feel a little useful.

Speaker 3:          01:23:01       You're way better off having less dough and something you really love. Yeah, but that's only if you have a certain amount of dough. That's the problem. Yeah. The stress of not having enough money to feed yourself, feed your family and a roof over your head. That's overwhelming for people. Especially as we were talking about earlier. If people have fucking credit card debt or student loan debt or some insurmountable amount of debt that can't get out of it just hangs on you, then you're not really thinking about what's meaningful for my what, so it's meaningful hobby for me. Oh Dude, it's the worst. Yeah. The feeling of debt is the fucking worst. And then the feeling of just working for nothing. That's also bad too. There's the feeling of like every day you're doing it just to exist and at the end of the day you're exhausted.

Speaker 3:          01:23:41       So what is your life? What is your life? Is your w your life, all this shit you hate to do yet? Well, that's the answer for most people. Most people, most of the time the answer is you're doing something you hate to do. And it's been me, and I know it's been you at some point in your life, but God damn the, the amount that your life can change if you just no longer have to do something you don't want to do, you could do something that you actually enjoy. Whatever it is, whether it's carpentry or painting or whatever the fuck it is that you love to do. Do you think it has to be your work or do you think you could be at work or you're like kind of into it, but then you have some other passion that's good, that satisfied. But you're also, if, if your work isn't satisfying, that's most of your life.

Speaker 3:          01:24:26       Yeah. You gotta do what you gotta do. Of course you do. Of course you have to do what you gotta do. That goes without saying. Yeah. So figuring out a way out of there, everybody's got a way out. Don't just, people love to say things like that. Like, Hey, some people don't have that luxury. People love to say things like that. So you have to acknowledge that, but that's, that's the case with anyone who has ever done anything where it was hard to do. Right. It's always, it's always going to be hard to do that, that it's used for you to say it. Of course. It's easy for me to say. I'm just saying that's the easiest thing in the world. I'm going to put a rocket on the moon. See, I just said, wow. Say exactly. I'm going. Of course, it's easy to say, but the difference just as a person who's done bolt, the difference between doing something you hate doing and doing something you love doing, it's off the charts.

Speaker 3:          01:25:12       How much better your life is. No, absolutely. You're making less money even if you're making less money. Exactly. Because like, you know, to use comedy as an example, because it's what we are. When you were making $5 a night, literally $5 a night as a comedian, I was so much happier than when I had a day job. Oh yeah. Making real money. Once the, I remember the feeling of being able to make a living with just stand up. Yeah. Like what? Like holy can and not a good living. Just getting by. And my beginning, it was super shaky. Shaky, right? Like I started making money. I was making like a little bit of money in Boston, but always had day jobs when I moved to New York. And then, uh, Jeff started managing me. Then I started making money. Like he'd get me booked in places and I was doing, I was working pretty much every weekend.

Speaker 3:          01:26:02       Who Was Jeff? Jeff Sussman. Sussman, longtime manager. Started managing me when I was at open Miker Oh, nice. Yeah. We've been together forever. Well, he's the best. He's still with them. Yup. Wow. That's amazing. Best. That's amazing. He's the best. I love the guy. That's great. He's an awesome person too and just a brilliant at his job. Super Low key. Doesn't give a fuck about Hollywood. Oh, that's great. But you know, he's, he's, he understands it. He knows what to do. Right. He hasn't care. It was like to do what makes you happy once he just wants you to be happy. It's awesome. So he picked you up when you're doing open mikes too. Dude, I'll scrub it wasn't even supposed to go on stage that night. Really? Yeah. He came into town. He had managed some other comedians. You Remember Bob Nelson? No, Bob Nelson Jeffy Jeff football guy. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       He didn't manage him. Really? Yeah, he produced his HBO special and um, they were parting ways and uh, they were parting ways and Jeff was like, well maybe I've seen everybody that I've seen in a New York, maybe I'll take a trip to Boston. So he took a trip to Boston and just fucking dumb luck when I was driving limos, I wrote a joke that day. I had this joke and I called up my friend Oliver, who was the manager at the club and I said, hey man, can I come in and do like five minutes cause I have this joke I want to try out. I said, sure, come on in. And he liked me. So he hooked me up and I went on stage and I didn't even know Sussman who was in the room when, cause I didn't know he was in the room. I didn't give a fuck. I was super loose. You knew who he was at that point? No, I didn't know.

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       I knew that there was a manager from New York that handled Bob Nelson. I'd be like, Holy Shit. I'd probably freak out. Sure I'd choke. I mean, back to shaky is fuck back then anyway, you know, I'm only like, of course we wouldn't have three years in a colony, so eat that. I was terrible. Yeah. Anything did often. It was really interesting. Like he took me to New York to um, he saw me there and then, uh, he took me to New York to try out. He wanted to see me perform in some other clubs. So he said, we, are you willing to come down in New York? So I said, sure. Yeah, I've always wanted to. I was so nervous about performing in New York, of course. Thought New York City was different. It was like more nervous. Then when he came to see me the second time in Boston, I was more nervous to perform in New York.

Speaker 3:          01:28:16       It's like, I can't believe I was one of it. Catch a rising star, which doesn't exist anymore. Just legends. Forget it. Your head. Yeah. That's a big thing. It's an because you don't know it yet. Yeah. Well it was like the New York comics were always like the smart ones. Yeah. That was the thought process. The insecure thought process in Boston. Like the audiences are smarter than not going to buy your bullshit smarter over there. Yeah, I know you're not fun and you're going to know they're gonna know. And uh, it's really funny. It's like sossman we were talking about like clean comedy versus dirty comedy and there was no really real decision like, you know, because back then people would like decide to be clean. It wasn't like you're a clean comic because that's how you think. Well, if you want get more work, the smart

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       moves through the clean as a business decision, as a business decision. It should dress nice and act clean. Took me to this place called, uh, we, we went to a bunch of places. It did eat side comedy club, which is a cool comedy club that used to be in long island. Then he took me this place called fast eddies and Huntington. And it was a, it was a local bar that had a comedy night. Wow. And we went upstairs and it was so, the crowd was so fucking rowdy and so drunk and there was a dude on stage. His name was George Gallows, hilarious dude who, uh, was doing a reverse shit with a banana. He was like, as you're waiting to go on. So he had a banana that he was like, he was somehow or another slurping it. Like it was a reverse shit.

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       And he's doing this in front of, you know, these people are hammered. It's like a Wednesday night or some shit. Right. And Psas and says, he grabs me by the arm. You don't have to perform here. We're going to, we're going to get out of it. And I said, no fucking way. I go, listen man. To my people. I go, I go, just trust me. Let me go out my paper. I'm like, this is what I do, man. All the gigs that I got in Boston for all bargains handle this. Yeah. You got hard. You get tough. Yeah. We'll also, plus it's once you've done a bunch of them, it's like chaos. It's fun. You know what to do, what to do. Yeah, for sure. It's a different kinds of comments like combat comedy, which was at that time you ran into that more than you didn't run into that.

Speaker 1:          01:30:28       Even today, if you get a road gigs, if you're a up and coming guy or gal and you get wrote, especially if you're a Gao, girls got get it way harder in the early days, like people like my friends girlfriend admitted the other day that when she sees a female comedian at a comedy club, she cringes still to this day. She goes, I get super uncomfortable when they start going on stage and when they're, if they're funny, it's a huge relief. I'm like, isn't that crazy? As a feminist, I hate saying that. It's terrible is I consider myself a feminist. I hate saying, I feel like it's gotten beyond that. I feel like there's so many, oh yeah. Such strong at the top of the chain, but if you're in some weird club in the middle of nowhere and some, yeah, I get, I get the, I get that fee.

Speaker 1:          01:31:16       I get like, especially if you're a feminist and you were around, you just don't want her to bomb cause then you think, well they're all the rest of the audience is going to think that's what all women are. Right. That too. And there's that. She just doesn't think they're funny. Very often she uses, she's not a comic, so she's just being honest about it. And we were laughing because when a girl says that you're like, oh no. But back then it was like eight every time. Even in like good clubs, like the comic strip or Caroline's, it was just like, it was war war. It was war, but nothing compared to like the the get, did you ever get any of those Bob Gonzo Gigs in New Jersey? Oh yeah. Oh God. Yeah. It was like a frat party. That memory just threw you up. They didn't want comedy.

Speaker 1:          01:32:02       Then those comedy, oh they turn you, they sees in you in a different way. They season you for like, like the comedy store was similar to that for a long time cause the comedy store in the early days had no crowd control. Literally zero. Right. So the crowd was in. It is in control sometimes. No one ever shot anybody up. No. But the new regime, it's handled so much differently was a new concept. It's so much better, so much better. But it did make you bulletproof. Yeah. You knew how to handle drunk. You came through that era, through that time or maybe it still exists when you're going through, but if you do that many gigs, that's why I don't, I really don't believe in just going to your one little alt room over and over again where you know you're coddled and supported and I really believe that you have to go into all these hellish situations.

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       So you just, anywhere you go, you know you can go and kill. That's an important part to being a comedian. And you also, as you become a successful comedian, you could fall into the trap of only performing in front of your audience. Right. You know, you really do have to drop in on other people's shows right here. People don't know who you are and why. Yeah. That's what's great about the storyline up to right. There's 15 comedians and they're probably not there to see you now. Where to see this guy or that car or, yeah, no, it's great. You know, you have to be able to survive because you see people that come out of those other environments and then they get thrown into this and they, they don't know how to act. I think comedy is like a lot of other things that are difficult.

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       There's things that you can do to get better at those. You know, like they say that like if you take, if you learn languages, you could get better at chess. I read something about that. Does that make sense? Did I make that up? That sounds about right. I would learn a new language. It'll make you better at chess. I might've made that up. It's just the way your mind is. Trying to think if all the different like cross training methods, how can it be better at chess? Do you play chess? No, but I want to but I'm scared. It's fun. I'm scared. Why you saw me play quake earlier? I have addiction, crazy addiction problems. Chesses is addicting. Tom Papa walked in and Jeff and I were going to war all we keep going at it. It was the most intense thing I've ever seen you do isn't as dense accidents.

Speaker 1:          01:34:26       Both of you on the keyboard and the thing sweating your ass off in front of these monitors. You were taking like deep, deep breaths in the middle of it. Do you sketch is just firing off at each other. It was intense. You ought to try to stay calm and these were in this very small map so I always know where he is. He always knows where I am and there's a limited amount of ammunition and armor and when you get jacked and you come back less strong with a weaker weapon, you've got to run to get a good weapon quick and then you've got to run to get where the fucking armor is and he knows where that shit is. So it's a crazy dual, like oftentimes if he kills me, he'll kill me two or three times in a row. It was so much faster than I thought it was going to be.

Speaker 1:          01:35:04       Oh yeah. I mean in real intense, is it always that like you're just in one four yard, one stone court yard running around many, many maps. You can just go, yeah, that's a good one for one on one. Oh, okay. We have these one on one matches the most fun because there's no other variables. Right. The variables of like if there's like 10 people, the Roman, everybody's shooting everybody, which is a lot of these maps. I'll show you that too. That's bring more chaos. Oftentimes you get killed when you are fighting a guy and then someone comes from behind. You. Didn't even see him and they shoot you some knowing. So how addicting is this for you? Oh, real. Real. It's a real problem. You used to do it right? Yeah, I'm way better at now. I'll do it like for an hour and then I'll stop and then you'll be good.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       In the old days it's very different, but everything's addictive to me, man. Every time now. All of it. Anything I like, I like, it's like it becomes addictive. That's why your shoulder's messed up. That's from Jujitsu, but it's not, the shoulder was more of a maintenance thing. It wasn't, it wasn't that bad. It was just getting a little sore and I wanted to get looked at and there's some tendinitis in there. Right. So I just, I'm real proactive at 51 I have to be real proactive about injuries. When things feel squirrely, he, and it's the problem. You can get hurt and then you can't work out anymore. Yeah, I like it too much. I like 'em, but even if it's not something as intense as Jujitsu, I just need to do something. Whether it's yoga or running is like me. No workout me workout. I like me when I work out so much more.

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       I like me better. It happened to me in San Francisco after the day. After the bond. Yeah. I'm just, I just woke up. I had good shows Friday. I'm just like, but I just woke up like kissed in a shitty mood, just kind of Eh, eh. And I knew if I could just get my shoes on and go for a run, I hold days going to be different. Yup. And it's just a half hour just going out doing and come back. And I was a totally in the same room, just feeling completely different. Not Crazy. It's just a mental shit. You're flooding your brain with all the beautiful thoughts and ideas that happen in there. And while you're running, while you're breathing, he got all these fucking ideas that come to your brand and get interested. You're breathing and you're running your concert. And he brought me, I'll slow down a little bit here. So what does it look better? Then you're like, fuck yeah, we're out here doing it. I am running. Woo. Yeah. It's a big deal. Who knows what chemicals are firing off in your brain? Man, dude, it's my dog and me because we run together. Oh, like inseparable. Really. Just crazy. It's hilarious. He follows me everywhere. Like when I sit down, he sits right next to me.

Speaker 1:          01:37:42       I've never had a relationship with a dog like this. Dogs that I loved that were great, but this dog is like stuck to me like glue. It's, it's so great. Part of it is because we run so much, so thrilled. He

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       used to, so when we run he turns and he'll run ahead of me and then we'll come back to me to check up on me when it comes back and runs with like this big smile on his face. Like I can't believe it's Ron runs again. How far are you running with him? A couple of miles. That's grills is a pretty steep hills. Oh, that's good. That's a workout. If I'm, if I have a short time, you can do a little, uh, there's one real steep trail that I run. There's once each other we have to drive to a little bit tasty, but it's super steep. Oh yeah. It's a way out near like a Gora. That one's rough. That's a rough one. That's gotta be tough. Yeah, because it's real long. It's like the whole thing is the hills because the hills are no pounding. Right. You can get a good hill under you.

Speaker 3:          01:38:40       It's way harder. So I just, I base it on 140 beats a minute. Anytime I get below 140 beats a minute, I just start running again. But I'll do these sprints. I'll go as far as I can. I get it into one eighties and then when I'm like, fuck, I gotta take a break, I'll just take a break and I'll look at my heartbeat, get my heartbeat down, note somewhere in the one 40 is 40 anywhere around one 45 then I'm ready to go again and then I'll go again. And I'm usually like one sixties you know, running, it's, it's rough hills or rough, really rough and thing, but it's changed my kicking power. Oh, he actually gave me more kicking power. Yeah, I can kick, believe it or not, it's probably like, I want to say like 10%, five or 10% more power from the runs. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       My pips or bigger muscles around my, uh, like my butt. Like the hip area right where your belt is like right below where your belt. I never had a muscle there. Right. What is that crazy from the hills? This is all from running hills. So when I stopped, like if I stomped the about like a front kick to the bag, that that four thrust is the same thing you're doing all the time. When you're running, you're running, you're pushing off one leg and you pushing off the other leg and you push because you're going up a hill. So when you're kicking, you're pushing off that leg and trusting that other leg forward. It's crazy. Is your dog a good on the hills? Does, does your dog ever get tired? Yeah, he gets tired. He gets, we know when they get tired, they get tired. When you throw the ball then it's a sprint. It's a sprint. And then you bring it back, bring it back here and it's like seven times like, y'all bro, I'm coming to lie down over here. You're like, no, no, no. Come on man. Give me that ball. Come on man.

Speaker 2:          01:40:20       My sister has to put down her dog tonight. 16 year old dog, a big like, um, like almost like a spaniel kind of thing. Wow. 16 years. And she's just, she's just been hanging on and she's just been the greatest and tonight seven 30 just has to go and just, there's no joy left. She just can't go anymore. It's going to be rough. I've talked to her on my way and it's just like, what a brutal thing to have to do. 16 years, my dog got hit by a car when I was like 14. Oh

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       14 or 15, right in front of me taking her across the street and we had, we had a busy street and her house and some car came down the street really fast. Ah, she got off the leash and ran right into this, hit her in a Volkswagen. Ah, yeah. It was rough to it. I brought her up, stuck, carried her up to the house. Did she die instantly? She died and like she died and looked in like 1520 minutes. That's so brutal. It's rough. She started shitting all over the place. How old was she? She wasn't that old. Maybe five or six. It's brutal. There's nothing worse. Yeah. So painful. Sweet dog too. Yeah, it was a bomber man. She just loved being in the park and we were heading to the park and she just got a little too excited and ran, you know, I didn't see the car coming.

Speaker 1:          01:41:43       Ah, I didn't get ahold of her collar. And Tom, it's brutal. It was so bad. It was so bad. She, but she, you know, she got knocked flying. I didn't even know she was going to die. You couldn't tell. It was all the injuries were internal. Brought her upstairs. She started shitting herself, started shitting all over the place. It was very unusual for her. She was, she's house trained, you know, and I was really scared. Have you had to go through any pet deaths with your kids yet? Yeah, the two, my two dogs. So I just had to put both of my dogs down. My dogs are around rational. Yeah. Yeah. They were, um, 13 it was a massive, and he was 13. Wow. That's great. Run at the end. I used to have to carry him into the house. Yeah. He couldn't walk anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       He would walk like literally, we'd be like, he would walk it's step, walk us down, you stay in his legs would be shaking. Had the kids handle it and they were really sad. It's hard, man. Isn't that the hardest thing when you watch your kids have to deal with it? So it makes it so much harder. Yeah. I mean it's, but trying to be brave. I think there's a lesson in it, you know, for real. I think it's a, it's not a good experience, but I think it's good for them to experience. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's what they have to go through it, you know, like pet death and, and just this, having those little relationships with animals. When you're a kid, it's like your dog. You could always talk to them and oh yeah, you can say crazy shit to your dog and now you're talking to be sitting in your room with you and you go, you know what? It's just you and me. You're the only one understands me. Woo. You're parents are acting like assholes. No one likes you in the house, but your Doug still does ship yells at me and going over on your way. You're going to come with me. Let's go out. I'm taking the dog mom.

Speaker 1:          01:43:38       Oh, it's the past. But watching your kids like trying to be brave and trying not to cry. That is such a heartbreaker. Just trying to be like, oh, I'm okay. Oh, it's just the worst. He was like, kill me. Hey deedee, notice deep up by your house, we have mosquitoes now. Really? We have like legit. Then we never had mosquitoes out here. There's just like real mosquitoes and they bite you only from like your knee down. Everybody round where I live is saying the same thing. We've never had mosquitoes. If you just wear pants, then your problem is solved. I only wear pants. So how they bite in you? Well, I take my shoes off on some of, I don't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:25       You're right though. I have noticed mosquitoes. I noticed some last night. We never had them in southern California before. I don't know where they're coming from. Well, we definitely had them. We just didn't have many of them. And this is how I know we had them. I moved into a house once in Encino and no one had lived there for like at least a year, I think. And the pool had not been tended to. So the pool was filled with mosquito larva. Ooh. It's like fish, like schools of fish. Oh my God. Around there. And I was freaking out. I was like, what is that? These fish. And I hired this guy, Kevin, the pool guy. Kevin, the pool guy came over and he was like, Brooklyn, those are mosquito larva. Oh my God. No. Oh, maybe that's where they all came from. It's a new thing. I mean, we used to have our doors open or windows up and no screens, no problem.

Speaker 1:          01:45:12       But now all of a sudden, just this last year. Yeah, we're so sad. You have to live like the rest of the world now. Why do I live here if I have to put screens on my windows? Do you think that'll last? Will it change? I don't know. Have you heard about this? Did you see that shit that I posted yesterday about that yellow mustard plant? Yeah, black monster looks beautiful. I was like, oh, that's nice. And it was the most though. I'm at this posting though. What's very strange man, because this shit didn't exist before. Like I never saw like on the same hills where I'm seeing it dominate the hill. It literally didn't exist a year ago and now it's just like an invasive plant. It's crazy plant. I just looked up my skills in Los Angeles and the thing starts an article from the end of last year, but it says, have you experienced an unusual number of mosquitoes bites the summer?

Speaker 1:          01:45:59       Mostly, but no, excuse me. Mostly below the knee and especially around your ankles. How about that? It's a called an aid. It's called eighties and the aids an aids bug. You have eighties 80 e d e s and that's a real problem, right? Yeah, it's a problem. It's a real problem. It says, what do I live in Spain? He just read it. E D e s and it's a real problem. That's funny. Here's spreading like wildfire. So Susan [inaudible], director of scientific and technical research services for the greater Los Angeles County Vector Control district. Sounds like Suzanne needs money for fucking business. That's what sounds like to me. Or our phones are exploding. Fake News.

Speaker 1:          01:46:39       Kidding. Los Angeles is home to two particularly troubling types of invasive ADSL mosquitoes. Oh man, they're going fast. The Asian Tiger mosquito arrived first having hitched a ride with shipments of lucky bamboo from China. You and your bamboo. I don't think my pole barbells thing. It's like a polymer. China. In 2001 vector control specialists monitored plant nurseries across the county and soon stopped finding the mosquitoes in their traps. They thought the insects had been eradicated. Whoever in 2011 residents in El Monte began complaining about unusually aggressive daytime biting mosquitoes plaguing the neighborhood. Yes. In the daytime. Ms This is happening. They even a infiltrated. What do you think would happen if people started seeing malaria in America? That can, why hasn't that happened? Good question. I'm sure doctor Peter Hotez could have explained that to us right when he was talking about infectious diseases from malaria is a hilarious, I know when I was still living in Ohio, West Nile virus to pop up a lot with mosquitoes.

Speaker 1:          01:47:49       Do not like, not like every day or anything like that, but I know that had to spray certain neighborhoods all the time like stay and keep your kids and keep your pet. Samara spraying your neighbor morale. I didn't sign up for this. How about, how about signing up for spraying in the West Nile because the spray is going to get to everybody. They used to spray when I was a kid in New Jersey, they would spray for the Gypsy moths, Jesus, they just come with, they wouldn't even tell us that. It's just like look at that plane and shit would be coming out of its ass end. Think of the difference between the way a butterfly gets treated and a moth. Yeah. Robots deserve it.

Speaker 1:          01:48:25       Dirty. Isn't it funny? It's a little, they're a little chalky and they have a plain color. We've got like that base around their head and then the same thing, the other gray or white, but it's only the way they look. He had the butterflies putable but isn't that crazy? Orange and black like we love them. Love them. You find a spider, you stomp it. You would never go to a zoo and go into the moth house. If you kill a lady bug, you're an asshole. Oh, completely. You're a type of person who kills lady bugs. Yeah, but if you don't kill Roach, I can't hang out with you. If you let a roach run across the kitchen floor and he likes hot nom roach, sadness, I save all. Kill that fucking thing. You got to Roche in your kitchen lady.

Speaker 1:          01:49:09       But a lady has a couple dots on it. Why are we racist with bugs? Because there's, this has such a thing as beauty. Okay. That's why squirrels get a pass and rats don't. Yes. Bushy tail. Yeah. Look in kill style like a fringe jacket matches a tail was just because they found that if the tails group bushy people would stop killing them. Yeah. I mean what's more disgusting than just a skin tail with nothing on it. Oh, awesome. Oh awesome. Tail possums. Don't even cause any problems. See possum Taylor. Oh, you little fucking Getcha Bat. Little hands. Little hands and your little tail. Oh, beady eyes. Yeah. Disgusting. Yeah, but like we have certain animals that we like, like raccoons. Look, we don't wreck like raccoons and they're eating out of your garbage button. Now, if someone had a pet raccoon, you would think that's the dopest thing ever.

Speaker 1:          01:50:02       Can we have, we secretly want relationships. Raccoons. If they would only be nicer to us, right? We would embrace raccoons. Raccoons don't want to have shit to do with us. They don't. I don't get it. They're smart. Too smart for us. We're nice to them. I thought these people are assholes. Sweets, they go to sleep and eat their trash. We'll just eat their garbage. Savory, eat their garbage. They put lids on it. That shit doesn't work. They've got that cool black mass lift the lid. You throw it aside to pull the bag out. They'll hands. I know if people hands they do with a little tiny people. Hey, I know you can grab stuff. Smoke cigarettes hanging out. Yeah, the text. They also wanna kill chickens.

Speaker 1:          01:50:39       Well, so do we. Do you know who's a real predator? Skunks. Skunks are predators. There's a skunk living in the back of my yard. Sprayed my dog. Oh No, it's still there. I think so. Come on, Bro. Man Out. What am I going to do? Take out the skunk hazmat suit. He'd begun time to go to war. I got to go crawl into the thing and find them crawling to the thing. He goes, look, it is fucking shit's crazy. It's like he's flaunting. He's like, yeah, look at that. His hand is so much smaller than his face. It's crazy. Imagine if your hand was that small and relationship to is the size of your head.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       He's adorable though, isn't he? He is cute little fella. He's like, look at, look, you think I've stayed out of your garbage? No Way. Look what I'm working with. Did they have opposable thumbs? I'm working with, didn't quite seem like five fingers with no thumb. Right. That's the thing. They never figured out. Look at his teeth. They never figured it out. Like they had meetings as hands dudes. We just need a thumb. Let me see the teeth. There we go. He's got his mouth open. That whoa, that would, that would really hurt. Fucking suck. Look, one of them is chipped. If, uh, yeah, from biting you in the head. Do you think if a racker tattoo you could fight it off? No. Well you could stomp it. What'd you do? What'd you give up? It might cut your neck. When would you decide we're going to to the death immediately.

Speaker 1:          01:52:02       Immediately? Yeah. He wouldn't try to talk to raccoon out of this. No. Soon as he makes a move. I'm ready because I've been thinking about it since childhood. Oh look at that one. I don't want that one bite my nose. Yeah, it was like a Hyena. The raccoon I made that thing. I've been thinking these things are coming after us my whole life. So if he makes a move, it's on, Bro. Those teeth are God damn terrifying. Yes. Look at those teeth now. And they're sneaky. That's a big thing. And they're filled with rabies filled. Yeah, to the top. Like their balls are heavy with rates. It's just oozing out of him to water balloons. Raccoons, Swisher burning his is touch. Ooh, I touch raccoons. Rely on their hands more than their eyes and going touch. You study suggested the sensitivity to touch increases when their hands are wet, which might be why they always wash their food.

Speaker 1:          01:52:53       Why? I just washed my hands and now I am going to touch you when you sleep. I ain't going to touch you and your children while you were sleeping with my finger hands that give a rat was as big as a raccoon and try to kill you. You'd be fucking terrified. No, we'd be, we'd be spraying. Oh, if there were rats. Size things. Just go on through La. Yeah. But why do you think we'll spray for these mosquitoes? I think it's time to call our congressman. Well, I think that everyone's afraid of chem trails. And if you start sprang gs circling greater Los Angeles drop and poisoned down. That's the wrapped with the pizza. I've seen that. Oh yeah, the pizza rat. That's he's famous. Rats are disgusting too. They're pretty gross. You ever seen that Netflix documentary on rats? No. Oh. Oh No. Really? Oh Dude.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       Really? Yeah. You need to watch it because it's um, it's educational. It's not just gross and it's really gross. But when you realize how many of them there really are in major cities. Yeah, the bio mass of them. It's a fuck stunning. Really. All rat. It's just rats. As many rat is more or somewhere in the neighborhood of as many rats as there are people really. And there's 8 million people and there's how many more as or more she's just, Oh, I mean you see them non stop walking around and just guessing. Obviously most of them are subterranean. Most of them are living in houses and most of them, I mean they burrow their way into tiny little holes. How long does the rat live? It's good question. How long does the rat live? Because they're born, there's a lot of them, but do they stick around for like 20 years to the documentary showed how they send young rats to try out poison.

Speaker 1:          01:54:34       Really? Yeah. The old suicide rats, they send them out there cause they don't know any better. They let them die. They're just assholes. Wow. Yeah. They, here's a little tip, if they're ever doing construction in New York in front of a restaurant, you don't need it. You don't need on that street. Why? Because they're digging it up. Whatever their little ecosystem is and they're just so, if they're digging up the street, they're dying somewhere else. I would imagine in New York, it must be so hard to keep them out of a restaurant. Oh, it's gotta be so hard. I guess maybe leave some in the dumpster for him. Like he'd give a lego monsters. Just the head. Yeah. Like when they was to tie the girl into the stakes for Kong. So you'd leave everybody else alone and a little shish Kebab stick. It's like your last job when you're closing down the restaurant, the gates, the rats are our friends put the skulls out.

Speaker 1:          01:55:27       Well, what is interesting? What are those various sizes of them? They'd go up to about two pounds in New York City to have a, he doesn't think there's any that are three because they'd be too big to be able to move around physiological limit to their size. Does it say how long they live? Average? About two years. One to two years in the wild, up to four. If you have it as a pet. A wow. That's it. Yeah. My wife had hamsters alert that my wife had rats for pets when she was a kid. Was she golf now? She was just like Jersey kid just loved animals and she would just ride her bike around in this rat would just be like on her shoulder. Jesus Christ. We're grat lady. Weird. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. What it was, but she said they were super smart and super affectionate. Yeah. If you had it, it's a whole life and you raise it right? Yeah. Why not? Yeah. It's not dirty. It's not like going through the sewers and Eaton Poo and climate on your hand. Right. But it would have just let it go. Maybe 100% she like had it out with her go rat. Like if you just let it let it loose in the wild, how long would it take for? How long would it take for a domesticated rat to adapt to living in like a New York City sewer? 40 seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       What do you think they were? Do they just get their crazy fucking Disney may look at you from the suburbs where he'd been living in a house? Yeah, with like, you know those are the multi colored rats. They have like all these little different colors on them. Oh, you so clean with your pink hair. Different colors. Look, hey Joe, get a load of this one. He's not even Greg. Hey, how come you ain't Greg? Look at Julia White. You're brown. You're like a fucking dog over there. Thank you. Better than us, don't ya? Yeah. Hey, get over here. I guess you don't know how to get into the restaurant.

Speaker 1:          01:57:18       What do you got money on you? You give us some money, we'll show you where you get all the good food. Yeah. You ever been a little Italy? We till the show yet.

You'd be better off being a hab. Alina. What's a half Alina? It's a peccary. What's a peccary? It's like a cousin to a pig. What's a pig you ever see that lead Doug lives? You know Doug lives in Bisbee, Arizona. Stan hope. Um, oh, by the way, I think it's so, it's sold out, but he's taping his, uh, his next special in Vegas next month. Oh, nice. Yeah. In Vegas. That's cool. Where he lives in Bisbee like he basically, that's Avalina.

Speaker 1:          01:58:09       He lives really close to the border. Like I think he's the only, like six miles from the border or some crazy shit. Um, and um, these things live in the wild, out in the desert, right? Fucking there are aggressive and they fucked up his neighbor's dog. They killed his neighbor's dog. Yeah, man, the dog was out and the Havoline is will flank it looked to get on both sides of it and they, they uh, like in a pack. Yeah. They hunt in the pack and they will attack a small dog that thinks disgusting. Gross. That's, that's like a giant rat. It looks like a giant rat. Well, it does look so it looks like a pig. Fucked her raw. Somebody shot in the face. Oh, crossbow. People hunt them all the time. It looks like a pig. Fucked a rat. I see. That got shot.

Speaker 1:          01:58:52       One doesn't go get pink. Fucked around, right? It does. Yeah. Click on the guy who shot one. Yeah. Bow and Arrow. A lot of guys a hunt down with archery equipment. See, wouldn't it be better if he was dressed in like a doe coat with a tie? None of those boots. You don't want that thing to see you look at that. That's a rat face picture. Giant body screw. Scroll back to that last one and make it bigger. Yeah. Yeah. Bra. That guys hunting rats. That's like a slightly different looking rat. Oh, you want to know what's really crazy? Giant rat. That's a hundred pound rat. Yeah. Without a tail. It's so gross. And you know what's really crazy is those were animals. Um, they'll, they're the best animal to a call now. What a call is, is like you'd made up make a sound of a wounded animal.

Speaker 1:          01:59:44       No, you make like, like something that's stopped suffering. Look like people take their hand, these fuckers run in, they run in gas, they're so aggressive. It's crazy to watch. Something's hurting. I can go eat it. They, but they have to act quick because there's coyotes out there and mountain lions out there. So when something's hurting you're like fuck food. And they just run towards it. So when your bow hunting, you almost have to have one person make the call and you're at full draw and then they start calling and the things come running in and you shoot at him. Yeah. Cause you couldn't do it. You couldn't get to the boat for a long time because they'd see you and they go fuck it. The guy took off the other way again. Yeah. Are these like invasive where they all over his property? No, they're natural.

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       They're there, but I mean are they not invasive? But I mean these are a lot of them. Yes. There's like a ton of where exists. Yeah. I mean they exist in the desert. I mean, they exist in healthy enough populations that you, people hunt for them. Wow. And they eat them. They say it takes you. Yeah. It was neat that you eed to pig. Yeah, but they're cuter. Wild boar. Yeah. Crazy tusks looking. Yeah, those are gross too. Pretty gross to my pigs. My kings. I believe those are the ones I have. Bow ties climbing around this guy's garage and little tap shoes. Sometimes I had do this shit down, Bro. They're standing. I'm down there in his garage. There's a whole bunch of 'em. Fuck. Is that all right on your kid's toy? Look at is. It's all it's hair's up is running way. Look at that.

Speaker 1:          02:01:21       Just going to take a dump in your driveway. Who'd you do not want that in your life? I don't want to live there. This fucking 20 of them in this guy's driveway. See that one there and the back. How many do you roll that back again? How many were there? There was like 12 what is the name of that video for? People want to watch it wild. Have Aleena's make a visit to Arizona home. Why? No, no, no. I know you can't show it though. Those fucking things are everywhere. There's a lot of them we feel while many of them there are at least at least eight. And then there's the one that was on top of the, there's nine. And then there's the one that was on top of the truck. And that is one that you could see through the fence. Yeah. And there's probably more out there too. It was gone in the car. It's going into the kids. A little car. Jesus Christ. It's in the passenger seat of the car.

Speaker 1:          02:02:12       Gross. Fucking creepy. Like wild. Have Alina is like a Dean Martin Song. Do you think so? Look at all over there. Look at, Oh fuck man. They're weird looking too. They look like they're demons. I don't like them at all. A little beady eyes like they're up to. No. Good, but if he was a little kid, you thinking like, I wouldn't live there because that's there. But if you live in New York at night, who knows what's climbing all around? Your building could be eagles and shit. Right? Is that what you talking about? No. Google. I get into my house and a Google Havoline it eats baby. Let's see if that's ever happened. Yeah. Human Baby. Let's see if that happened. What do you think if I have a of eight a human? Yeah, like she, those fucking things. 20 in that guy's drought. They definitely eaten babies.

Speaker 1:          02:03:02       I'm exaggerating. It wasn't 20 someone's eating the baby right now. Probably 13 it was probably 12 Baker's dozen. A Baker's dozen of heaviness. Yeah. They would eat a baby. A toddler. Yeah. Knock it down. Yeah. I mean if they eat a dog, yeah, they're scared of people. Obviously. We weren't scared of that dude. Now that's a full brown person and the baby doesn't end. It doesn't have anything. I know. I put his hair up, spikes up to let you know. It's threatened to ever tell you the story. When I pulled a rabbit out of my, uh, pull vacuum. Yeah. Was it alive? No. Did Stink. It had it stunk. I'm like, why isn't the vacuum working? Did you think about it? I dove in and I pulled it up and there was a half a rat. It's ass sticking out the vacuum. And as soon as I got it above the water flies, just pull it out without it.

Speaker 1:          02:03:59       There's a quest. She king. Where the fuck are the flies before the shit? Good question. Where the fuck are they all over there? Not that many. Like if you, if you are around by a person's backyard. Yeah. How often he's, he flies every now and then there's one, it's kind of annoying, but if you just pulled your pants down, shat on the ground, it would be flies on that within a matter of moments. Oh, you mean right after I swam, you swam the shaft right on their law. I mean, you're after swim shit. Yeah. And then all of a sudden they show up. Yeah. It's disgusting. It happened so fast. So gross. All of a sudden they're all like, yeah, like where'd you guys come from? We should just stay inside a little. Did you find a baby death from of have Alina a couple of months ago. It's not.

Speaker 1:          02:04:44       A couple people in Arizona were attacked and they had like old woman was bit while she was walking her dogs and other guy was bit while he was feeding them and he didn't feed it fast enough and it bit them. That's about as much sacrifice. Well the lady who got bit, that's the scary one because the guy who fed them as an asshole. Right. This Gary one. That's it. There was a lady got bit by a coyote recently in Dallas though. Yeah, no, no. Yeah, it was around the Dallas area. I think they think that there's just one coyote that's been biting people. It's a rogue, unusual coyote snapping at people. Yeah. They had bite marks on their legs. Oh my God, that's gross man. Cause they will kill you. They would kill you. They're just small. They're just not sure if it's worth the effort and you're around people and they're worried that you know.

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       One on one cause you fight off a coyote. I don't know if you could then, I mean I think you probably could if you had to, but they'll fuck you up man. Just keep buying it. There's a few of them. That's where the real problem comes. If they bite you in the right spot. Yeah man, the rip your tendons apart. You won't be able to run away. They know what they're doing to, you know, they know what they're doing. It though. Did try to take your legs out. I mean they know what they're doing. They're not going to try to jump up and bite you in the neck. They're going to try to take your, your hamstrings out trying to rip your legs apart so you can't run. Why are they so mean? That's how they're alive. You're not leaving any food out for them or you know, you've got to do what they gotta do.

Speaker 1:          02:06:03       It's called domestication. That's how we have dogs. Do you ever take your family camping? I have not. Yeah. I haven't either. I would though. I wanted to take my kids to Yosemite cause I love Yosemite to bring a peace sign arm. Nothing just went solo. We weren't camping and we were staying in it and we were staying in an end. What about emergency food? No morale. Iphone, nothing. Just a phone. First Aid kit. Nothing. Bag of Funyuns and an iPhone. So I need, and I want to show them you'll 70 cause it's such a great part of my life. I love it. I've been living in the back country for like a week at a time. I just love the whole thing and I telling them about it and I'm building it up. They would be like, you know, but grudgingly going. They're all vegetarians. They just love nature. They just love whatever. So I'm like, you're going to love Yosemite is as we drove into the park, welcome to Yosemite. I ran over a squirrel.

Speaker 1:          02:07:00       The horror inside the car. Dad, you didn't even slow down. What's wrong? You're a monster. I'm like I can't. It's two lanes. There's a guy behind me, a guy front. I just would steamroll the squirrel. They were so they were in the whole weekend. Anytime. I'd be like, look at this. Look at this beautiful view. You killed a squirrel. You didn't even care. That's the weird part. Dang. You didn't even care. Is that what they're saying? Yeah, we were supposed to cry. I was just laughing like a bitch. Yeah, exactly. That's what he did. He killed a or you'd be sadder, right? Right. Yeah. Well I can't, damn, I can't believe that she is. She was so nice to their little eyes and little tail, but it's square a peccary. Yeah. If you can't win them Havalinas like he's fucking rat thing. Fine. It's mom that have Avalina would ruin your, that punch to bite your teeth.

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       He'd probably use it's t to tear your tires apart. Then you be stuck in the side of the road trying to change a tire. You turn around, there's a whole pack of them closing in on you. Would you not take your family because of all of this? Do you not want them in the woods with you? What am I a danger in the woods or become a werewolf? What the fuck? He just got to stay tonight. Trust me. I'll be right back. Not that you're the threat, Ron, that you'd have to protect them from all the threats. Well, I mean Yosemite doesn't have that many threats other than people bears. They have black bears then. Yeah. Most of Mountain Lion Mountain lions are an issue. There's always something out there. Yeah. Grizzly bears or you're just for, you just don't feel like that's a cause. You like going out into nature, you go do all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:08:46       I do like one of the nature also, like being indoors, like sleeping in a place where it's awesome to sleep. People wiser than me if figured it out that that maneuver is called a bed with a roof and a locked door and a refrigerator. You fucking cave person. Oh, I'm going to rough it. I'm gonna Sleep on the ground. You don't have to, you know that I can sleep in a house. Yeah, but when you go hunting and stuff, don't you sleep in the woods sometimes? Most of the time, no. I'm going to have, oh you don't. You go back to [inaudible]. What? What guys I go with. Go with Steve Rinella. We always almost always go camping except for one were at our friend Doug Durrance place, which is a, he lives in Wisconsin and he's got a giant farm and we hunt deer on a hundred year on there.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       And uh, that place he's got a cool little, little like a deer hunting house. Oh yeah, that's near the s yeah, like a cabin. It looks like a house. It's like a house, a small house at everybody. A look. Hangs out in different spots there. Yeah. Right, right, right. I'd like to take my kids camping. There's something nice about sleeping in the woods and shorter in nature. You know what else is cool? Not getting eaten. Hbo Take a shower in the morning. That's nice. Yeah. You got go stove, coffee. That's the big thing. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I put up, there's nothing better than a campfire. I now hanging out, especially at the end of a long day of hiking, and then you've got a campfire, and if you get one of those little grates over the campfire, you start cooking, Cook over the campfire. That's the bass, the best things in life.

Speaker 1:          02:10:23       I know and I feel like my kids don't have that connection cause uh, do you worry about being with them in the woods? Yeah, a little bit. If anybody gets hurt, it's hard to get out. Yeah. And just that, you know, it's like if you and I went, we're both responsible for, we'd help each other out, but I'm going to leave. Get your act together. What? I'm going to leave you. I'm sorry. What? I'm going to leave you say that again. Yeah. I just, I can't, I cannot tell you guys planning a camping trip like, hey, we're going to look out for each other. I'm going to leave you behind. I'll tell you right now, it looks you on my leg camera with you, but I'm not, I can't handle any adversity. I will fall apart. Please don't. Where are you going? And we're not going in too far. I will walk one mile when the alarm goes off at one mile camp.

Speaker 1:          02:11:14       Dude, seriously, you're not going to help me out. I'll call somebody when I get there. He's back there or mile. I don't know, something like a mile. Just follow the blood. He's got a backpack full of Slim Jim's. It'd be all right. It'll be good. He's got enough food on. Well, I left him one liter of my pis. Uh, he can drink that. Just got his leg where I peed. Horrible camping and commanding. I got good news and bad news. The bad news is I don't have any water. The good news is I have to pee. So what do you want to do it one day? I mean to fill up your Nalgene bottle. Oh, awful to know. But you're, but if you go with your kids and you're like, you're responsible for everybody and everything and yeah, it's pretty, yeah, maybe just a hike. Well, there's nothing wrong with camp when the kids a good idea. Just, you know, you should, if you really aren't going to go camping, you definitely should bring first aid and definitely brings a satellite phone and you can camp in places that, you know, you're not back country a mile in. You could just, you know, pull up, walk 200 feet off a fucking airstream son. Pull that bitch behind park. Turn the generator on satellite TV. Yeah, that would be fun. Stores. You can rent those and just talk to her. Yelling out the window.

Speaker 1:          02:12:43       Making friends. I think uh, I would like to like load them up in a RV kind of situation. Go see the Grand Canyon. Go through Utah. Like Chevy Chase. Yeah. Yeah. I think that we're going to be fun. Two more people just died in the Grand Canyon. What fell? Yeah. Really? Why they're not just reading the railings? I don't know. I don't know what happened. I just read two more people just fell to their death in the Grand Canyon. Really? Let's see. If you find out what's going on, why are people, that was one of the first hikes I did with my father. We do in the switchbacks. What'd you say, Jim? If there's a reason why I say, well I'm a guy who's got too close and slipped and I need to know what I slipped off the stop falling. If I had Google glass, I didn't know. And already if I had that memory link

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       wire thing that Jamie's worried about, Jamie's going to be the first one to get it. Then he's going to like organize to make sure that no one else gets it. My thought on that too was like, who is going to be the first one to get it and how you decide that? Well for sure like money, Marcus Brownley and Lou from unbox therapy, they'll get it first and they'll put it on and then they'll start running the world and they go, ah, no one else gets this dope. But Mark Zuckerberg probably already has it. You don't want to it right now. Fend his case.

Speaker 3:          02:14:06       Yeah. It's um, it's coming. Something's coming. Yeah, man. What's it gonna be? Who knows what's going to be, something's coming and something's going to be more invasive than what we're experiencing now, so I can be sure of. They're going to figure how to get more and more data. You know, Sam Harris has a really interesting podcast. It's out. It's either the one that's going on, right? Maybe the two weeks ago. And it was all about, I should probably find it. It was all about um, privacy, privacy and what's the difference between the way a different tech companies approach privacy and actually it makes you respect how apple does it. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean they apparently they do it much more. Um, I guess the word would be there more ethical about it. They're trying not to give away any trouble with Facebook is what it's called.

Speaker 2:          02:14:58       I was reading a thing yesterday that you know, you put those a doorbell things on, you know like ring, you know the records, people coming up to you and they said, you know, you think it's cool for you and your family but the ups guy or all these delivery people that are getting their picture taken and sent to a database every day, right? Like these people are being monitored all the time. So while it's good for you, it's not that great for these other people that visit you.

Speaker 3:          02:15:24       This guy's name is Roger Mcnamee. That's the one, it's the trouble of Facebook. It's episode one 52. It's really, it's very interesting cause the, what what goes into is about how tech companies figured out how to tap into a resource that no one thought of. And that resource is your data and how much is that worth? Well, it turns out it's worth fucking untold billions. It's one of the most valuable things cause it you can direct market to people. You could find out what people are in tune with or not and to you get, you get a lot of people that you can get ahold of. And we kind of gave our consent to this without understanding it. Yeah. And they got in through a loophole and this is how they're able to make, you know, ungodly amounts of money

Speaker 2:          02:16:08       just because we wanted to have that cool feature. So you just say, yeah, here's, take it from me.

Speaker 3:          02:16:13       Maybe thinking about the amount of money, something like Facebook brings in versus what it is. Like what is it? What are you doing? What are you doing this making all that money. They're providing people with data, you know, and they're also getting people to the, it's like a, an ongoing psychological experiment in what makes people engage. Like what makes people comment more? Turns out it's anger. Oh really? Yeah. It turns out that what makes people engaged the most is things they disagree with when they started having fights, fights back and forth. So you get people to get really into these polarizing subject, right? And then you, once they start looking for those subjects, then they'll subject starts showing up in their feet since all sorts of things that they get angry about. So then they started interacting with these things. The more you interact, the more more it shows up in your feed and all the wild, they're profiting on enraging you. I'm like God, I mean this is essentially what they do. She creepy Facebook patent uses image recognition to scan your personal photos for brands. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          02:17:20       Yeah. So they just take all your photos and I'll collect dorito bags in the back.

Speaker 3:          02:17:25       Applying computer vision algorithms to user uploaded multimedia objects to detect specific objects within the multimedia object and promoting the uploaded multimedia object from a user's news feed to a sponsored stories area. That's what the patent was awarded for. Ah, Jeez. A little vision content detection for sponsored stories. Wow,

Speaker 2:          02:17:51       that's crazy man. Yeah. You snap a selfie sipping a Unicorn frappe at Starbucks and then shares that selfie on Facebook or Instagram. Facebook's newly patented technology can theoretically scan the photo, spot the Starbucks cup with the help of an image object recognition algorithm and then sell that info to Starbucks. Alerting the coffee giant of the fact that you like it's product.

Speaker 3:          02:18:15       Well, they're already doing a version of that with your search things you're looking at. You know when you go through their browser, they're already doing that.

Speaker 2:          02:18:23       Well, they're doing it also with voice. Your phone is listening to you all the time. If you have Alexa in your home, it's listening. My kids and when we, we do it all the time, like if you're talking about something and then all of a sudden you see, I was performing in Boise and so we were talking about Boise, Boise, Boise, and then everybody on their Instagram was getting an ad for vacationing and Boise. See, that seems gesture must speaking it. That seems like a really serious thing. It is. It seems like a really serious thing that everybody is just like, oh, this is happening. Yeah. I remember signing off on this. The technology is ahead of our anger or our recognition of it. Yeah. We don't understand. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:19:02       It's already happened by the time you're upset that it

Speaker 2:          02:19:05       exists, right? Yeah. It's, it's in full full force right now. Yeah. Yeah. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. I mean, we're just talking about it. This is just, we think it's, you're just in your home. You were in a private place, but these phones that are just listening, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:19:24       and again, this is something that didn't exist 10 ago, 15 years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       Did these concerns didn't exist. What would be the concerns 15 years from now? Look how much more invasive as is going to get before we even recognize that it's happening. Because this is, this is something, the, the, the listening in on things is something that people didn't think about before it happened. Now they know it does. Well, the face recognition thing is there's a lot of articles on that and how that we don't realize, well, they're trying to think. Totally makes sense. Right. Especially with so many people's phones use face recognition software. Right. With the Samsung phones have it, you know, my, my galaxy note nine has it. Yeah. I phones have it. Yeah. And you're psyched about it. You're just like, oh, that's cool. I don't have to put in my password anymore. It's just look at it now I'm in my app. They also have one that's an iris scanner on the note.

Speaker 1:          02:20:13       The note scans your irises. Oh, really? Wow. Borough. It's quick too. It looks at your eyeballs like, Yep. Yeah. You, she do, you know, man, what does that say, Jamie? I was trying to find it the first time you brought up, but I know that there's these masks that exist that are in quotes like hyper realistic masks and that can be used to, I don't know if it's this, this and it's used to help the face recognition, but I think people are using them to trick it and do fake stuff and like not all, if you could commit a robbery with that on and just like having a ski mask on now they just can't see her face. But it'll thinks that right. If you had a Hoodie on. Yeah. What about in minority report? Remember when they had to pull his eye, they were selling eyeballs on the black market for the eye scan to get into buildings and staff to do with that is put like a Bandana around your mouth. Right? So it could, no one could see your mouth moving. Have that thing on your sunglasses. Yeah, but my, even my iPhone gets through my sunglasses. I don't know how I know. So let's face some recognition. So, but what I'm saying is with this, like if you wanted to rob someone and have something like even the facial recognition software would, would think that it would legitimately think you were somebody else. Hopefully now. And what about for when we're doing our crowd and we were trying to rob us or hopefully not moody guys. Criminals.

Speaker 1:          02:21:35       That's crazy. It's kind of happen, but it's so fast too. I mean, you know, this is so new. We're also the like the special effects technology that allows people to make faces the code. Look how beautiful those things look so close to a person of these for a 200 bucks. You could fly. One should do it. Listen, I'm going to get you, oh, I should buy you and then see if I go open up your phone. Yeah, that would be crazy. That would be cool. That'd be crazy. See if it can open up your phone. Look super creepy. But oh that's so weird. Oh he looks like a demon. If they can add a little late texted or it could be moveable Kinda. Wow. That looks pretty real though. I mean, you know a little creepy, but that looks pretty accurate. That's crazy. Act. I wouldn't look twice on the walking down the street and even think about it now. You'd be like, that guy has a good shave. Sorry. Beautiful Person. A skin so smooth. Your baby's bottom.

Speaker 1:          02:22:34       It was started off. That's my face.com and it's not been switched to whatever. This is your meeting surveillance. That's just creepy. She's there. Do you guys know, is there a problem with doing like any of those, uh, 23 and me ancestry DNA, bro. The government. You're going to the Illumina and he's going to check your fucking spit. Do they? Is it bad to do? I don't know. Should I do not do it? What are they going to do with it? How are they going to clone me, Bro? If they want your DNA, they can get it just by touching your clothes, getting ahold of your stuff. They can get ahold of you. They could, they could find out all sorts of stuff from hair samples right behind hair. If you drink a Starbucks and then they grab your cup, they can get a DNA sample off your cop, then someone can get your DNA sample right.

Speaker 1:          02:23:18       So it doesn't really matter. So if I want to find out if I'm Greek or Italian, she find out, I should find out. It's pretty comprehensive. Have you done it? Yeah, I've done it. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. It gives you a lot of other weird stuff too. Like um, uh, that you might have certain genes that for certain proclivities even including like lactose intolerance, uh, propensity to alcohol, really alcoholism. Some super athletes have certain muscle jeans you should find out if you have those genes, like power athletes, like almost extraordinary number of ones that are successful in certain sports. Oh really? Yeah. A type of Jean or does it, and it gives you all this, so you have to specify this at all. It's a really detailed report. Oh Wow. Yeah, it's really detailed and covers all sorts of different categories. And it's cool too.

Speaker 1:          02:24:05       And you find out like weird stuff. You know what part of Europe your parents were from, you know, maybe you have some Asian in you didn't know you had. It's, it's really cool. Yeah, that's cool. It's cool. It's, um, it's just, it makes you really think like to get here in 2019 what had to happen. He all the people in the past and if you keep going back, you know, like I have a little bit of Asian in me and it was like 1% or something like that. But I think like where did that come from? Like who, where was that? Is that why you liked you? Just to I don't think so. I think a lot of people just like Jujitsu Bro. Is that why he likes Sushi? Um, I don't think it's that Asia, they come from a different agent, but I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:24:51       I think, um, I think, you know, if you could show somebody though, went through Asia and hooked up with somebody. Yeah, for sure. But what I'm saying is I think that if you look at what technology was available like 200 years ago for finding the ancestry, people didn't even know if that was their kid 50 years ago. Right, exactly. Two years ago he had a guest, you know? I mean maybe they had paternity tests 50 years ago. Did they like just trying to find your roots back in Italy? You just have to go find like town hall and see if there's a book with your great grandfather's name in it. Yeah, but I mean, you didn't know if your dad was really your dad. If your mom was a hoe. I knew that. I knew that around sixth grade. I figured that out.

Speaker 1:          02:25:32       It's wanting to know a hundred years ago, if you were the father of someone's child, you to look at the kid and go, the kid looks like me, or convince yourself with the kid looks like, or convince yourself the kid just got your wife's features, but it's still your kid right now. You can actually get DNA test done and be like, oh, you know what the coldest, hardest shit is when you find out that it's not your kid, but you still have to pay child support because you've been paying child support and you still have to, if the DNA confirms that he's not,

Speaker 3:          02:25:58       it's in different states. There's different rules. But uh, I believe that's how it is in California and I believe that's how it is in several other states where if, uh, it turns out the young lady had strayed,

Speaker 1:          02:26:09       ah, no caught subside. Dick is a, hey, hey, woo, got to go now. You got to keep paying. Yeah. Who you know, that's not gonna keep paying. Even if you do a DNA test and you find out the child's not yours, I think once you have started paying, unless you, you might have to go to court and, and Duke it out both. I don't think your payment obligation stops just because it's not your kid. And what a weird shift to if like you think it's this kid and you're supporting them and then to beat switching your head like, no, I'm not going to help him anymore. They didn't have testing really until the 80s whoa. Yeah, until the 80s Oh, it's a whole new world. Oh No, no. [inaudible] was one of the first one that people didn't really even believe it. Remember? That's kind of how I got on. Right. That's right. And they started just see us saying that they didn't know how to handle the samples and they, well there was some funkiness with that two stepping all over it. They didn't believe the one in a trillion kind of numbers. They were passing out of it.

Speaker 3:          02:27:14       Thank overzealous aggressive like police and detectives. I think that's common. I think that's the short term it is. Did you see that fucking video? It happened. Tesla sentiment mode. Did you see that shit? Now, you know, Tesla is a century mode and it caught some politician back in is escalate into a model three scuffing it up, getting out, looking at it, trying to rub it out, and then taking off. And they called him up because they could see his face in the video and they knew who it was because this guy had been like a kind of prominent politician. And so, um, here it is. There's those little, the little nick, but they said it was like $2,000 to fix. And when Jesus, that's a lot of money for that, a little nicotine, it seems a little ridiculous little scuff. Um, so the dude just backs into it and tries to jump.

Speaker 3:          02:28:07       Yeah. It's funny. Yeah. Bonk right into the Tesla is the side. It's always recording. He just backed his stupid car. Guy Just doesn't know how to drive. He might've been drunk. Yeah. Oh yeah. Look at him. Look, sat down. Looks at it. All right. You don't have to. Well, he tried to fix it. He's in deep shit. He tried to fix it. The fuck he did. He did not, if when they call them, oh they did cat. And apparently that guy had already been to jail for something else here. Dirty. Yeah. He, uh, it's not good. It might be. That's our map. I, um, I bumped into someone's car once and I left a note with my phone number and my, uh, my address. Nice or not my address, my phone number and my name. And they called me up and they just so happened to be very good friends with someone who else runs with.

Speaker 3:          02:29:04       So then he calls me up and he tells me, dude, you hit my friend's car. I go, tell him to call me, man. It's cool. Yeah, it was unthinkable. I, it wasn't bad, but it was something, I was like, it was a little scuff on the bumper. Right. But it was my, it was, I was like, oh, thank God I left a message. I would feel like such a piece of shit. Yeah, exactly. I wrote my friend and he was like, some fucking ass hole. Hit my friend's car and took off. You believe that shit. I'm like, no, crazy, bro. That's, that's bullshit. And now cameras have everybody doing everything. So you'll always get busted. Yeah. When do you think it's going to be where you have a Tesla? You know what those things do? When do you think it's going to be where no one's driving?

Speaker 3:          02:29:49       How many, how many more years? Well, we're, a lot of people aren't driving 20 I would say 20 to 30 you remember when Prius is where a joke someone had a preach to like get that fucking stupid thing away from me? Yeah. Or even the early Tesla. The roadster. Like, do you know that top gear you want to, you know that British show top gear? Here's what's crazy. I found out they did an episode where they pretended that the Tesla roadster died on them while they were driving around the track. But it didn't really die on though. That was just a storyline was they wanted it to die. So it's gross. Apparently the way the show is made, it's like a comedy show and it's scripted so they can get away with doing something like that. So Elon Musk's sued them and I think he lost, believe it or not, cause they don't claim to be exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:30:43       They don't claim to be factual and they complained. They, they don't, they don't claim to not have narratives. Right. They create. Cool. So gross that up just to make sure that I'm that grocery gross. It's amazing how many shots that they take. Elan Musk called top gear completely phony and his company sued for libel and malicious false. So it's a judge dismissed the suit in October saying no view or the program could have reasonably be compared the roadsters performance on the track to real world performance on the street. That seems fuzzy. I don't know what that means. Okay. What is um, 2012 that one. What is the case? What did he said? What Elon Musk said that it was, that they faked it and they claimed the power Tesla for, okay, let's see what it says. We could figure out, I think, I'm pretty sure that's the story.

Speaker 3:          02:31:33       After Tessa dropped the car off, Elon Musk claimed that one of his employees was along for the delivery. Notice that a script for the episode inside there was a segment about the Tesla breaking down, but that was only the tip of the iceberg. Top gear claim that the Tesla roadster ran out of power while driving after just 55 miles, much less than the 200 miles quartered by Tesla all be it. It was being driven hard. A claim that Musk said was untrue. According to him, the roads, there's logs show that the car had never dipped below 20% charge during the entirety of the filming. The clip followed with the roadsters motor overheating, which wasn't addressed by mosque. And finally a break failure, which must claims was instead a blown fuse and not an equipment failure. Battery powered electric cars will soon die altogether. Former top care host James Mason.

Speaker 1:          02:32:19       Ah, interesting. Isn't it amazing? So there was something,

Speaker 3:          02:32:24       sounds like there was some horseshit for sure, but it does sound like there was a real break problem and the brake problem was a blown fuse, which there's nothing you can do about that,

Speaker 1:          02:32:32       but just that he hates such a strange thing that like, yeah, you just have to attack electric cars. Like it's just a, well, I think the wem them making a script. If they had a script that said that the test was going to break down, they thought it was be funny. It's a comedy. It's a comedy show. Jeremy Clarkson was fucking hilarious. He's really funny. Yeah. But there is definitely people that are, yeah. You believe a lot of the stuff that they say and the performance of the car. I would, you know, I always thought it was funny, but I also saw them as experts. Well, they kind of are. I mean, they know a lot of shit. Yeah. They know a lot of shit about cars, for sure. Jeremy Clarkson, he knows a lot about cars. The problem is people go to them for advice and lap times and all that shit.

Speaker 1:          02:33:17       And if you're saying it, cars breaking down and you, you engineered that script, it's pretty dirty. It is dirty. Well, that's how like Sean Hannity gets away with saying that he's not a news program. Does he get away with that? So it's a WWE of news. He says it's a, it's a, it's entertainment really. He says, yeah. Yeah. Oh, do you have a little, a little out. We're not a news program. We don't claim to be. He says that. Yeah. Although a lot of people are coming to teeth thinking it's news, but isn't he a commentary program? Isn't that what they say? Oh, he's not that. He's new. He says it's entertainment. Oh yeah. Do you, do you find entertaining? No. No. I should just say, oh, I could do this as it's entertaining. He's a liar. He, it's not that entertaining. I didn't find it entertaining.

Speaker 1:          02:34:05       I'm going to sue them and the game of Thrones people tracking those aren't real drag dope as fuck. Did you watch last night? I didn't. I did was again, spoiler alert. It was awesome. Oh yeah. Awesome. Just to see everything. I just want to see it. I was happy to see a new episode. I'm going to be so sad when that show gets canceled. I'm such a Dork. You've watched it all the way out and about doing the prequel or the beginning of it worry series, but they haven't come. Amen. Whoever the fuck of people other than doing it. You just keep doing things. Whoever those people that are writing and producing it and putting it together and keep hiring those actors to play different people. I don't care. I lost my way after like maybe three seasons. How many seasons is it benign? Like five. Fuck up. You lost your way. Go back and start from scratch and learn all the names of these places and the make believe thing.

Speaker 1:          02:34:57       Whatever's, how much do I have to know, Joe? I know what you know how to make bread. Just keep making a dish is bread. I do keep it simple. A Martini, a little bread. Little run. It live your life. Yeah. Jog. How much? Why do I have to do I have to control everything? I would like to nef. Oh, catch back up with it. Yeah, it's good.
