Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience lie. Apparently you don't need an ID to fly. You just need to go. They were like, we need to put you through like 20 security tests, so come to the airport two hours early. I was like, God dammit. They're going to molest year. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Have you ever had that happen before where you get like roughly frisked?

Speaker 1:          00:16          No, but I have gotten yelled at by a TSA agent because I didn't want to go through the body scanner and he was like, what are you a celebrity? He's like, only celebrities don't want to go through the body scanner. And I was like, why? I was like, this is crazy that you're talking to me like this. Like what the fuck? This is nuts. It's an option, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. He was just like totally demeaning me. Like in front of everyone was nuts. Why would celebrities not want to go through it? But it's like, yeah, why would you want to get molested? I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:46          well it's. I've never had it happen to me. Everyone has been pleasant with me, but Graham Hancock, who's been on the podcast several times, she's a good friend. He went through one and he said this dude like just was aggressively sexual with him, like grabbing his, his body, like it felt like he was being molested, like I shouldn't say aggressively sexual, but he grabbed his cock and the whole thing mean like he said, it felt like he was getting raped, like obviously not as extreme, but you know, it's like a form of a violation and he was really shocked by it and he wrote about it. He was shocked enough that he didn't just let it go. We sat down and wrote some stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Well, there was this report that came out that said that there's so many more cases of malfeasance and misconduct and the Tsa than any other government. I mean this is like 20 times more. And so there was this investigation done to find out, well why is there so much fucking crimes happening? Like robbery, sexual abuse and stuff. And it was. And basically this representative figured out that they don't really do background checks. Oh my God. And they're just kind of skipping through this huge, uh, you know, you think that you would. So basically they're hiring a pedophiles and child and lessors what they found out. Yeah. No, wait. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:56          Well not nice people too. We should, we should say that I've, I've met a lot of really nice people to Tsa.

Speaker 1:          02:01          You fucking government chill. Relax. Well, how do you think that you should do security? We did before nine slash 11 was totally created in the wake of nine slash 11 is a total thing. New Government Agency. Just like the department, Homeland Security and just, I mean think about it, the hijackers brought on what knives, like you can still bring those in. This Guy Jonathan corbet basically expose the fact that you can just create an insole in pocket and bring in whatever the fuck you want through these body scanners. So they really have like a huge security breach. So. But when you go back to why the body scanners were implemented, like an inside pocket that's like silver or something. Oh. So it has to be like, yeah, you can carry anything through. Oh Wow. Yeah. But I mean, the reason that the body scanners were implemented in the first place, this is Michael. Michael Chertoff was tied up with rape, rape, a scan, which is also the name of the body scanner, right? Rapiscan, rapid, rapid scan. But I call the government was really

Speaker 2:          03:00          like, Yep, losing. I've got a patent rapiscan. I got a patent, I'm not changing the fucking name. And then you understand it 100 percent. Like you ever the worst feeling in the world. Strong words you ever go to a concert like pipe. My wife me go to fucking. Oh God son. That's the ugly one. And my wife made me go to. Is always bad. But then when you say, I shouldn't say the only thing worse than Dave Matthews is John Meyer, your wife made you go to a John Mayer, John Mayer Meyer. And she was just like, just enthralled by him. I could do. John Mayer will know I can do to. No, I think he's great. I think he's very talented. But if your wife is really into going know what I'm saying, like she dragged you there and just stares at him.

Speaker 2:          03:48          And you're like, I paid for this. Paid to have your wife close her eyes later and think about him. You notice she's not clapping because when her hand slipped down. Okay James, she's deep. She's clapping with one hand. It sounds like something stabbing of seal. It sounds like one of those martial arts movies where they ripped a guy's heart out after. She's just fiserv herself. She's all the way to her elbow. Just gritting their teeth and pounded it in there. Get the wedding ring off. She's just fucking strafing the. You can see her rib cage expand. That's a fist. Goes up there. Okay, let's go. Then you realize it's in her asshole. You thought it was bad? Fucking shit. Up to. What? Is this the fuck are you doing? I thought we were going to see a concert. Just says licking her arm. Oh John. Oh John, make me eat my shit. Meanwhile, that's not the craziest person that ever lived. Nope. That's not even close.
