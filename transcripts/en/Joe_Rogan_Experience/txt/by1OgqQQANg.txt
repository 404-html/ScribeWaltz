Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Five four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Boom. And we're live. Peter Schiff. How are you sir? I am good. I am good. Thanks for having me back. Thanks for coming back. Yeah, it's been three years. It has been a while. You've grown a lot. I'm so impressed with what's happened to your podcast, your popularity. Thanks man. Thank you. Hopefully a little of that trickles down to me. I'm sure it will. You look good dude. You look healthy. You look at vibrant. Well, you know, I got a little bit of a beard going. I've been living in Puerto Rico. We were talking about that off air. Tell me about that. Like what, what prompted that decision? Well, you know, I live in Connecticut and unlike southern California where you are fortunate enough to still live, I lived here for a long time, years and years ago. But uh, we have, uh, seasons and uh, one of them is winter and it tends to be very long and it normally Kinda, you know, kinda moves into the fall and the spring a bit.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       And so I had been thinking for years about kind of splitting my time between Florida and Connecticut because I Love New England in the summer. It's beautiful this time of year. Yeah. And I like the beginning of fall, you know, with the leaves are still on the trees and it's not that cold and it's pretty. And you know, spring is nice too. So, but yeah, I can forget all the winter. So I was going to move to Florida until I found out about Puerto Rico. And I found out about this actually because I read an article interviewing John Paulson and Halston was John Paul, John Paulson, billionaire hedge fund guy made a lot more money than me shorting subprime. I did the same trade. I just didn't make as much money as he did, uh, because I didn't start out with nearly as much money, but in any event, but, but, but he made a lot of money shorting subprime and he's a hedge fund guy.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       And, um, he was investing down in Puerto Rico and I was like, well, what's he doing? What's, what's going on down there? And I found out, and I had never known this, that Puerto Rico as a US territory, Americans who live in Puerto Rico don't have to pay federal income taxes on the money they earn from Puerto Rico, which would include any of your capital gains on your investments. And I'm like, wait a minute. I mean all I have to do is move to Puerto Rico, don't have to pay any federal income taxes cause anybody can move there. You don't need a, a, a, you know, a work visa. You pick up and move there. It's just like moving to another state. Right. And so the minute you move there, you don't have to pay federal income taxes, but Puerto Rico has its own taxes. So you have to pay the Puerto Rico taxes instead.

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       And up until recently, I mean, Puerto Rico's income tax, I think tops out at 30% it's still cheaper than the u s and there's no state income tax. It's, that's all you've got, right? Is that the 30% but a few years ago, Puerto Rico got smart and they said, well, how do we attract businessmen, entrepreneurs to move to Puerto Rico if they're not already here? Well, let's just drop that income tax down. And so they basically created these two laws, act 29 22 and act 22 is for individuals. And it says, Hey, if you move to Puerto Rico, you have zero capital gains tax on any capital gains and you have zero on any interest in dividends that you earn locally. And then they passed another act, which is at 20 and they said, hey, if you open up a business here, you have a company, you're going to pay a 4% corporate tax to Puerto Rico, and then you can pass on all the profits in dividends to yourself, tax free, no tax in Puerto Rico, no tax in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       And you know, that's, that's a great deal. That seems to be worth a tremendous amount of money. It is. I mean, it depends on, but you effectively double your income by moving there practically. So, because you're not, you know, you're not splitting your income with the government. Right. Right. And, and, and, and so I checked it out when I heard out about front, heard about, because first it's like Puerto Rico. Do I, you know, do I really want to live there? And you know, I'm thinking west side story. I don't know. But, um, you know, it's beautiful. I mean, I live in a town called Dorado beach. Ah, and you know, it's just, it's very, very nice. The, the, uh, the weather and just the tropical location and there's a lot of good people there. A lot of people have been moving there. Obviously I'm not the first person to take advantage of this.

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       And so there are a lot of people that have come from California to get out of, you know, California taxes or the northeast, the Midwest, you know, plus when you come from the Midwest or the northeast, you also, you know, help yourself get out of the cold weather, California. It's pretty much all a tax thing. I mean, no one's leaving southern California, uh, other than really the taxes because you got such great weather here. Um, but I, I, we enjoy living there. My wife enjoys it. She's met a lot of people. I've met a lot of people. And you know, the crazy thing is, you know, you have this movement now in Puerto Rico where they want to become a state, which is ridiculous because if they became a state, all the problems they have would be that much worse because Puerto Rico is in trouble today, despite the fact that you don't have to pay federal income taxes there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       I mean, that what happened was the Puerto Rican government is, which was very socialist. They borrowed a lot of money and they, you know, they, they spend a lot of money to get elected. And uh, you know, a lot of people in Puerto Rico work for the government and a lot of people are on welfare, food stamps and stuff like that. But big government is what destroyed the Puerto Rican economy. And they, and they borrowed a lot of money. But if on top of that, Puerto Rican residents that actually had jobs had to pay the federal income tax, you know, it's not just the federal income tax doesn't apply down there. It's the obamacare tax. You know, people wanted obamacare repealed. If you move to Puerto Rico, you've repealed it for yourself because the taxes don't apply down there. They don't even have to pay the federal gas tax. So without all those taxes, they're still in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       So can you imagine how much worse it would be if they had all these taxes? If all of a sudden the irs descended on, on Puerto Rico, like an infestation of, you know, mosquitoes and be worse than the Zika virus down there to have the irs. Uh, so, but you know, there's people, they've told a lot of people, hey, if we become a state, you'll get more welfare. Like, oh, so vote to become a state. But what Puerto Rico, the last thing they need is a more, more incentives to be on welfare. Right? They need freedom. They need less government. They need to default on a lot of this debt. And a lot of the people that own the bonds unfortunately have to lose some money. But I think that as more and more people move to Puerto Rico, I've got two businesses down there now. I'm hiring people, I'm renting space.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       I bought a lot of property down there. You know, more and more people like me as people come to Puerto Rico, the economy's going to improve, it's going to get better. Uh, but if they become a state, they're going to destroy all that potential. They, they have to exploit the fact that Puerto Rico can offer such a great advantage to a businessman. Somebody he wants to create a company, employee, people provide goods and services. They can do it in Puerto Rico. I know on a, on a much favorable, uh, basis relative to anywhere in the continental United States. So this is a recent thing for you. How long have you been down there for? Well, I moved by asset management company. So I have a company called Euro Pacific asset management. And I moved that company from southern California. I was based in Newport beach with that business and I moved to San Juan I think in 2013 and then I moved to Toronto.

Speaker 2:          00:06:56       So I have my office there and I moved all my portfolio managers, they all moved from California to Puerto Rico. That's going to be a tough sell. You know, they love it down there. But was it difficult to convince people to pack up to which essentially another country? It's not really, but it kind of it it's America. But yeah, technically it's not like that kind of a situation. Yeah, well it's the same status, but I've never been to Guam. But I mean you do feel, it does feel a little bit like a foreign country when, because English is the second language. Everybody is speaking Spanish. So in a way, you know, but all you look around, it's all the same restaurants. It's all the same stores. So it's American in, in all the malls, you know, the same malls. And so there's a lot of ex, not really ex pats because they were actually still in America.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Yeah. You do not renounce your citizenship when you move to Puerto Rico. You do not have to pay an exit tax. I you still travel on on an on a US passport. Everybody that lives there is an American. So it's like a sweeter deal than moving to Hawaii. Well Hawaii you got high taxes, you're still paying federal income taxes. Paradise. Yeah. Plus you're paying the state income taxes in Hawaii. So, but you know, my guys wanted to move there cause it basically almost meant that their income was going to double like pretty much overnight cause they can participate in these tax breaks. But you know, my, one of my guys is married, has some kids and you know, they really like it. My single employees, I have a few young guys you know, you know, good shape working out, you know, young portfolio managers but they've, you know, they quickly got Puerto Rican girlfriends.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       You know, if you've got a job down there that's a big plus because most of the Puerto Rican guys and out of you know this, but I think five of the miss universes of kind of Puerto Rico. I mean it's, it's a small little island country, but they got some beautiful women down there in Puerto Rico. It sounds like you're a salesperson for Puerto Rico a lot. I should. I've said so many people down there. A lot of people have moved there because to me, I run into people all the time. They see me on the beach. You have to Hell Pete. You know that you're the reason that I'm here because they heard about it. But, but look, it's a, it's a good deal. And you know, I would love to see Puerto Rico succeed as a mecca of free market capitalism right now. You know, it's a poster child for the failures of socialism because they, it's the socialist that killed Puerto Rico, just like they're killing a lot of major cities in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       But if we get more entrepreneurs, more business people are coming to Puerto Rico, you know, that is what Puerto Rico needs. They don't need to be a state, they don't need the irs. They don't need more government. They need the opposite of that. So you learn in Spanish or are you just sort of standing around? Well, I mean, we're doing it. They're all Americans. Americans. But I mean, I speak English. I mean, I, I took high school Spanish, so you know, if I go through a dry through, you know, I got to try to use my Spanish because a lot of times they don't speak. But, um, and no one, if you talk to someone from the police or the fire department of those guys speak any English. But most of the younger people, they've learned English. And where I live, it's everybody speaks English. I mean, nobody addresses me once I get out of the gates of the rich, you know, Rich Carlton, you know, I go out into a movie theater, they're, you know, they're speaking Spanish.

Speaker 2:          00:10:04       And then if I say, do you speak English, then they'll talk. But where I live, everybody addresses everybody in English. So in that respect, you know, you're still there. So you live in like a gated area that's a part of the Ritz Carlton. Yeah, it's a gated community, but it's very large. You know, we have a lot of golf course, so I think three or four golf courses were on the beach and there's, you know, a lot of different places to live there. Any resentment from the locals? Not that I can feel. I mean, because I mean, I know some of the locals could feel, hey, these guys are coming in here. They're not paying a lot of taxes, but I pay a lot of taxes as a, just a raw number. It's not a big percentage of what I earn, but it's a big number relative to what other people might be paying.

Speaker 2:          00:10:42       But you know, I'm doing all, I'm hiring people. As I said, I rented office space. I mean I bought a house, I bought a condo. I'm going out. So I mean they benefit, they like having, if you're, if you like having people doing stuff and in, so I don't, I don't, I don't see it at all. Now if it becomes a state status, if it changes status, will you move? I don't know. We'll see. I might have to, I mean, it might not. I mean, it won't be nearly as lucrative and see, here's going to be the problem. If they ever became a state, see people that live there pay a 30% income tax. Now you know, for to, not, not people like me, but the people that were already there. So it kind of like in California you have 10 13% income tax. But imagine if you had to pay a 30% local tax and the federal income tax on top of that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       I mean they have a 13% sales tax now, if they have a higher sales tax. So they have, if they became a state, they would be by far the highest tax state in the United States. They mean a disaster. Right now they have the lowest taxes in the United States. So why would you want to go from having the lowest taxes to having the highest taxes? It's, it'd be, it'd be suicide to become a state. Yeah. So they would have their local taxes and then on top of that they would have federal taxes. Local taxes are fairly high in terms of like a local state. Yes. As much higher. Right? But

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       then on top of that, they don't have federal taxes. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:11:56       And you know, the other thing is Puerto Rico has a lot of debt. I mentioned that, right? But on a per capita basis, they actually have a lot less debt than America does. I mean, your share of the national debt right, is much bigger than the average Puerto Rican share of the Puerto Rico debt. Because when you live in California, not only are you responsible for the state's debt, you're responsible for the national debt. The people in Puerto Rico, I'm not responsible for the national debt. So if they actually became a state, they would be in worse shape than they are now. They would actually have more debt. Right. So it's like it'd be like buying a ticket on the titanic after you've already, you know, it hit the iceberg yet you still want to buy tickets. So hopefully this is all a bunch of politics and it won't become, it won't become a state and it'll just continue, you know, they'll default on a lot of this debt. Hopefully they'll prioritize a lot of things. Uh, they'll shrink the government and more and more people like me will come in and start creating businesses and hiring people and you know, five to 10 years from now, maybe you'll be the wealthiest part of the united,

Speaker 3:          00:12:57       so correct me if I'm wrong, but the two possibilities are, it becomes a state and they get more welfare. They get more essentially more aid, more money. Yes. Or it stays where it is and more people like you have an incentive to go there and then entrepreneurs open a businesses and then there's more opportunities and then the general wealth of the island grows and that it helps people just by virtue of more.

Speaker 4:          00:13:22       Yeah, you got it. Becoming a state just means a bigger welfare state. It means a greater incentive not to work and a bigger punishment if you work because the taxes on people, that work will go sky high, you know? So that's going to be a huge problem if you know. So good. The problem that the appeal of being a state is that so many people don't work. But you know, one thing that we could do to help Puerto Rico is get rid of the minimum wage because they're stuck with our minimum wage, which is a disaster because the average income, the average wage in Puerto Rico is about half of what it is in the United States. And so the minimum wage of seven 25 is like having a minimum wage of $15 an hour. And if you're one of those people that likes a $15 minimum wage, look at how high the unemployment is down there because you can't, you know, you people can't get jobs at, at these, at these wages.

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       You know, the best example too of America destroying one of it's a possessions with the minimum wage was American Samoa. I don't know if you've ever read this, but a few years ago, uh, Congress applied the minimum wage to all the territories are minimum wage, which included American Samoa and in American Samoa, the biggest employers on the island where these tuna canners and so chicken, you know, chicken of the sea or star cast. And so all these people worked in these factories canning the tuna and they worked in, in, um, in American Samoa. Well, when the mirror and minimum wage was passed it, it made the island uncompetitive. And so the tuna factories closed down and fired everybody. And so all of a sudden there was like 30% unemployment. The island went into a massive depression and they still haven't come out of it. I mean, we destroyed them, we destroyed all their jobs.

Speaker 4:          00:14:59       And the, the, you know, the American Samoa didn't want the minimum wage, but you know, American politicians don't give a damn and all they care about is feeling good about themselves, not about the consequences of what they do. And so they, you know, they, they impose that minimum wage and it was like declaring war. Well, it had a lot of damage in Puerto Rico, just not as much as it did in American Samoa. But if we can get rid of that minimum wage in Puerto Rico, then there'd be a lot more employment opportunities for younger, unskilled people. They'd have the opportunity to climb up the job ladder to get some skills so they can earn more money in the future. But right now they're just permanently unemployed. Uh, because of that, so we could get rid of the minimum wage. Also, there's the Jones Act, which has really, really hurts Puerto Rico.

Speaker 4:          00:15:40       And what that Jones Act that says is that any ship, right. And that that's going to America. They can't stop in Puerto Rico, drop a few things off, and then continue on to the United States. They have to, they have to go all the way to the United States, unload their cargo, that's going to Puerto Rico, put it on a US flag ship with a u s crew, and then send it back to Puerto Rico. And it costs a fortune. Right. So that's one of the reasons that their tourism is not that competitive there. Because all the other Caribbean islands can get cheap stuff dropped off on boats. But you know, we have to wait for stuff to come on a Jones act boat. And so it, what was the incentive to pass the Jones act? It's for the unions, the Maritime Union, the merchant marine to try to, because you know American ships are uncompetitive.

Speaker 4:          00:16:27       Like if you ever go on a cruise on, if you go on a cruise, but none of these cruise ships are flagged in the United States and none of the crews are American. That's because if you had to use an American crew with our laws, nobody could afford to cruise. It would be too expensive. The only way that you can have a cruise line that anybody can afford the travel on is if you flag it in some other country. Well, so because the wages are just off the charts, but that Jones act means if people in Puerto Rico, you know, whatever they're going to buy, whatever they're going to consume in order to bring it to that island, you know, they're going to have to bring it on a, on a US flag ship. Now it that, that's a problem for Hawaii too. But the people in Hawaii are much richer on average and the people in Puerto Rico, so the poor you are, the more you're affected by, by higher food costs are higher, you know, costs of everything. So it's, you know, you have a lot of these, you know, liberal politicians, they refuse to get rid of these laws. But that would, would very much help Puerto Rico just more free markets cause they, they have no control over that federal minimum wage where the or that Jones Act.

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       So you don't think there should be any minimum wage at all? No, no, no. None boat. So someone working for a dollar an hour, it doesn't bother you. Well, I mean it's better than working for zero. I mean, people think that, um, you know, they, they want to impose their morals and say, well, it's not right for somebody to work for a dollar an hour. Well, you know, people make rational decisions, right? And so somebody

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       is accepting a dollar an hour and that must mean that nobody offered them a dollar 50. Nobody offered them $2. I mean, this is a competitive, a market. I mean, I know you have an employee over here. I mean, could you pay this guy a dollar an hour when he worked for you? I don't think so. Yeah. Well a got, because he could get more. Right. But he's, he's educated and skilled and he's an engineer and of course, right. But it's very difficult for people to get that sort of an education, particularly in wwe is Puerto Rico thought of as a third world environment and so country third world. But let's say some kid came in here that had no experience whatsoever, but he wanted to learn. He wanted to just get you coffee and just sit around and be around you. He's not that productive. Yeah. They use the interns, right?

Speaker 4:          00:18:30       A lot of radio stations do that and they don't pay them anything. I know that $0 million and I can't do that. Well then yeah, but maybe you pay him $5 now, whatever it is, but people, people are going to accept a job. That's the best one they can get, and so if somebody is working for a dollar an hour or $2 an hour, by default, I know that they couldn't find a higher job than that. And the reason is because they don't have a lot of skills. But if you don't have a lot of skills, the best thing you can do is get a job so you can get some skills. That's where you learn skills, you get more skills. You know there are people that pay to get skills, right? If you go to school, you actually have to pay tuition. If I'm getting paid a dollar an hour while I learned something that has value, that's better.

Speaker 4:          00:19:09       You have people now borrowing money to learn a skill. People Graduate College and they're in debt, right? It's not a weird, that's a weird argument, right? Because you're assuming that they're going to get a skill. I mean, they might just be handling packages and picking them up and moving to another location. That's a whole or well, even that's like show up on time, be responsible. So disciplines and showed a lot of work. There's a lot of stuff that you learn when you have a job, but the problem with the minimum wage is that the minimum wage basically hurts the very people that it's intended to help because the minimum wage basically says if you are a worker, if you cannot convince an employer to pay you seven 25 or $10 an hour, whatever the minimum wage, then you cannot accept that job. See, it doesn't hurt the employer.

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       It hurts the employee because it limits his options. It limits his ability to sell his Labor, uh, for the highest price that he can get. And it limits his access to the job market. It's a, you know, you can't get on that ladder. You, you know, you remove the lower rungs. And so I can't climb up because of this arbitrary minimum wage. Uh, because when you pass a minimum wage, you're not going to force an employer, right? If I'm an employer and there's a minimum wage of $10 an hour and somebody comes to me and they can deliver $5 an hour worth of productivity, meaning if I hire that person that will benefit me by $5 an hour, I'm not going to pay them $10 an hour because then I lose $5 an hour. The only way I'm going to hire somebody who's going to give me $5 an hour worth of productivity is if I can buy them.

Speaker 4:          00:20:39       If I can, you know, hire him for less than $5 an hour so I can make a profit. So it just, it sits like a floor. It's like if you cannot deliver enough productivity of whatever that minimum wages, then you can't get a job. And so it's basically making it illegal for people to work. It is the stupidest law that anybody has ever conceived. A, it should be obliterated. I mean, there are some countries, like Singapore does not have a minimum wage. And you know, the average income in Singapore is higher than it is here per capita. There's a lot more millionaires there. I mean, people have no problem. We didn't always have a minimum wage in the United States. I mean, this is a creation of government and you know, but the, the initial minimum wages, if you want to actually go to the origins of minimum wage in the United States, it was about trying to prevent employers from hiring the Chinese or hiring blacks.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       They were trying to force them in ways as a way to create unemployment. It wasn't, there wasn't a, a good motivation. But yes, when they try to sell it to the voters, oh, it was all about, we don't want people to be exploited, but you know, it's not exploitation of people voluntarily accept the job because it's the best job they can find. The person who's offering the best job is not exploiting them. They're giving them an opportunity. And if you're denied an opportunity, I mean, there are a lot of people, oh great. You know they're going to get the minimum wage up to $15 an hour. Well, what good is it being unemployed at $15 an hour? It's better to be employed at $5 an hour than unemployed at 15 because being unemployed means you make nothing. Right. We're devil's advocate would be that if you can't afford to pay someone $15 an hour, then you probably shouldn't have employees in the first place.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       Your Business doesn't function that well. No, there are plenty of sense. No, because there are plenty of jobs where you have entry level positions. I mean, if you think that there should be no entry level jobs, I mean you go back to the days of a full service gas stations right? Back in the day when you know you didn't have to pump your own gas till the case in New Jersey and a few other states, New Jersey, you know, they mandate it, but you still don't get the level of service. I mean, if you've pulled into a gas station 40 years ago, not only did they pump your gas, but they checked under your hood. They, I used to do it. Tires, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you know, they, they watched your windows, you know, they did all sorts of things. Uh, you know, with your car, they didn't make very much money.

Speaker 4:          00:22:56       They lived off of tips. By and large it was the minimum wage that eliminated almost all those jobs. It's a minimum wage. That is the reason that we have, you know, people sell so much self serve. But what happened, a lot of these people, these kids that worked in filling stations became mechanics because all these filling stations had a mechanic there and they, they learned auto mechanics and a lot of them went on to own their own gas stations. But of course a lot of them, this was their work experience that formed the basis for the rest of their life. A lot of young kids had these jobs, summer jobs. And so there's nothing wrong with a entry level employment. There's nothing wrong with people learning the responsibility of having a job of showing up of customer service of mean. My first jobs were all sales.

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       I was selling subscriptions door to door. I was telephone sales of this, the z channel and California. I sold, I was knocking on doors selling cable television. I worked in a shoe store selling shoes. I mean, but hustler. But you were talking about you as a young man, right? That's a lot of people think of the minimum wage as applied to adults. Adults that have to take care of children, that I have to have a roof over their head and food on the table. And you're saying that that, that they shouldn't be having those jobs. Well by the time you are an adult with kids, you should have accumulated the skills to earn a lot more than a minimum wage. So that's the argument when people say, Hey, you can't afford a family. You can't support a family on the minimum wage. Of course you shouldn't even be trying to support a family if you can only earn the minimum wage.

Speaker 4:          00:24:25       You shouldn't have a family. You, you should realize, hey, I can't afford a family yet. Let me acquire the skills before I start fathering children. Right? And, and getting married, let me make sure I can support myself. I mean, a lot of people who are having the minimum wage, they're living at home, they're there. They, you know, they don't need to pay the rent. They're living rent free. What they need is a job they need maybe gas money, get some money. So I could take a girl out on a date, but I gotta I gotta get some work experience. I got to get out there, I got to know what it's like to work. I got to see, you know, I've got to live in the real world and that's what used to happen. I mean, you don't have all these summer jobs anymore. Kids don't have the opportunity because the minimum wage has already priced them out.

Speaker 4:          00:25:04       A lot of older people now we're taking those, those jobs and so the, the employment opportunities aren't there. But when you just raised the in wage, all you're doing is raising the bar where you can get your job. You're not helping people. Now, there is always going to be some people that, yeah, there's going to be somebody who will make a little bit more because of the minimum wage. There's going to be those people, there's gonna be some winners, but you're going to have lots of people that make nothing because of the minimum wage. And then of course, because you're driving up the cost of labor prices are going up. And so who is affected the most by higher prices, poor people. People who are working on minimum wage. Uh, and not only that, you end up with less quality. I mean, you know, I hate it when, you know, I call up a company and I'm just in voice mail.

Speaker 4:          00:25:46       Hell and I'm going from one I would like a real person to deal with. But you know, with the minimum wage, those jobs don't exist. There's so many jobs that have been automated out of existence because not automated shipped overseas where there isn't any minimum that too. I mean that too. Yeah. You end up, if you actually get a real person there in India, right, right. But we have all these people in America who aren't working, why can't they do those jobs? Yes. You're not going to be able to support a family on those jobs. But before you even get a family, you can have that job and then maybe you know, five or 10 years later you'll work your way up the ladder, you'll get a skill, then you can support a family, but nobody is supposed to be able to support a family and if you try to tell an employer, hey, you gotta, you gotta pay your fry, Cook enough money to support a family, you can't do that. There's not enough productivity cooking French fries. You can't support a family family. If all you can do is cook a French fry, you need to learn how to do something else before you can support a family and you can't, you can't put that on the employer. Now when you say that Singapore has a

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       higher average income is, is that because and no minimum wage? Is that because there's a shitload of billionaires that have moved to Singapore because they don't have a minimum wage because they're getting explore. No lower class people or people that don't make much money. The millionaires and billionaires don't eve are really not even affected by the minimum wage. What you'd have to look at is the rate of unemployment rates in Singapore sentence for very rich people to move there. And doesn't that Jack up the minimum wage or not the minimum wage rather than the average income? Yeah. Well the fact that you have entrepreneurs that are succeeding in Singapore because they have small government and low taxes means that there's a lot of competition for workers. And so that's what bids up wages, right? Competition. I mean I've got no problem with a vibrant market bidding up wages.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       You just don't want the government to try to artificially force wages above their productivity. Right. Because it's ultimately your productivity that determines your wages. You mentioned that you know, your, your, your employee here, he has a lot of ads, a lot of value because of his knowledge, because of his personal good. Look at, look at Samsung. Well that doesn't, that doesn't help me. But uh, but you know, and you're like, we're laughing. But there are a lot of people, look, there are a lot of people that earn more money because they're good to look at. Right? There are plenty of people that are paid more models, but you go to Puerto Rico and then Miss Universe and right. But even people hire receptionists or people hire people in certain positions because they look good and they get paid a little extra for that because that's added value to the customer experience and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       So most of us can't live off of our looks. We gotta, we gotta have some something else, but it's all a function of your productivity. You want to earn more, you have to produce more. Did government just can't mandate that people pay you more than you're worth as far as the productivity that you can deliver because you're just not going to have a job. You're making a ton of sense. And uh, obviously I'm not a financial wizard like you are. What, when you'd start talking about like people making more money for their, looks not, that would be a hot button topic in America and people will get very upset about it and that people would say that that's a sexist viewpoint and you're objectifying these women that you have working in these positions. What would you say to that? Like a secretary or someone who's a receptionist who's super hot, like the year you're objectifying this woman?

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       Well, you know, there are a lot of men and women, men get hired for their looks too. I mean, it's not just a one way street, amy. It's like you said, but look, you know, people make the most of what they got right. I mean, people say, Hey, it's not fair. Why should this? Well, it's unfair to the unattractive people, but build the unattractive person could be really smart. Maybe she ends up making mom and ugly. Well look, you know, not everybody wins the lottery life can have them write a little bit. Isn't that the problem with socialism and the idea of we should even out the playing field? Yes. I mean the idea that competent and you're a competition guy, right? But you know, a famous Democrat, John Kennedy said that life is unfair and live in a different era, but it's not fair. Right. And he's just trying to bang a lot of checks and you can't, you know, you can't dwell on the things that you don't have. Hey, I wish I could've been born better looking. I could been born tall, taller.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       You know, you've got to make the most, it's like playing poker. You got hand play it, you can have the worst hand and you can win the pot. Right? So, you know, obviously is it easier to win the hand if you got four lasers? Right. Right. But you know what, if you're a bad player, you'll win nothing cause everybody's going to drop. Right? And so even getting the best hand, it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna play it. Right. But you know, it's not, I mean, if two people, if I want to hire somebody and the way they look, I believe is going to help me earn more money because I think that having a more attractive person and particularly business position is going to somehow lead to greater sales. I mean, that's really the only reason that you're going to pay somebody more money if they look good. Like look it on, you know, I go on Fox television or CNBC, it's not an accident that all these women interviewing me are pretty hot, right? I mean, unattractive women could read the news and ask me questions just as good as they can, but they're hoping and they're betting that more guys like us are going to tune in to watch a hot chick interview me. Then a home we won and they're probably right, right? Because probably lots of homely girls that are applying for these jobs, they're not getting hired.

Speaker 3:          00:30:46       No, I, I agree with you 100% but there's a fascinating thing that's going on today where our competition is thought to be in somehow some way, shape or form a negative thing. And that this kind of competition, whether it's co, even capitalism itself is criticized, right? Like there's a lot of people today that are in favor of socialism and it's one of the reasons why Bernie Sanders was so attractive is because like, Hey, you people that are not winning this crazy competition out there that don't have any desire, we're going to even out this playing field. And those people that are out there kicking ass and taking names, we're going to take some of that money and we're going to just give it to everybody else.

Speaker 4:          00:31:19       Yeah. That is the appeal of socialism because it appeals to the lowest common denominator. Downloads his appeal to ignorance, but it appeals to greed because an envy like, oh, this person has so much more than me and it's not fair. But here's the beauty of competition because this is why we want competition. We all want stuff, right? And and so I want people competing to sell me stuff, right? I want to have as much as I can as far as consumer goods. That's what we all want. We want products and services that enhance our lives and the way we get the best products with the highest quality that deliver the most value at the lowest price is to have lots of competition. All kinds of people competing for my business. Hey, I've got some money to spend. Oh, buy my product, buy my product. Competition is what's made is what makes sure that I get the best thing.

Speaker 4:          00:32:11       Right? You go back to the old Soviet Union and uh, you know, there was no competition. Let's say you wanted a phone in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. Well you went on a waiting list and maybe three or four years later, if you were lucky enough you had the right connections. Somebody gave you this big fat black phone, you know, and, and you had one phone and it was very expensive. You know, that's, that's phones under co under capitalism. Look at the phones we have, I got a fallen and I could take movies with it. It's a kit. It's a computer. It's a camera. I used

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       it to get here with its GPS. I mean, do you think I would have a phone like this if the government was, had a monopoly on phones? Absolutely. I had a by any government phone that they were going to put in my place. So we all to say the competition isn't good. All the things that we value wouldn't exist if people weren't competing with one another. No, I'm, well, I'm, I'm a big believer in competition, but one of the weird arguments is happening now is that competition is bad and it's a very blinders argument. And I, I saw you battle against that argument when you were with occupy Wall Street, when you went down to the park and talk to those people. That's how I, for a lot of these very aggressive, very passionate people with a limited amount of understanding about capitalism itself. They had no underst hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       And it was, it was a wonderful exposing, but they were there, which was weird, right? Well, they were in there. They have signs, they're screaming, they're yelling, they're angry, but yet, yeah, and you know, is very little understanding of what the system that they're rallying against. One of the reasons I went there, and if you haven't seen it, you're plenty of youtube videos of it. The law there, there's one that's like two and a half hours. Right. That's the whole, I talked until we ran out of power. Right. I've seen them all, but I seen about 10 videos of you talking to these people, but somebody just recently resurrected. It, made a copy of it and got another two and a half million views just a few months ago. So I know people are watching it, but you know, I went down there because I sympathized with the fact that people are upset and, and that I know that the economy is not as productive as it should be.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       I know there's a lot of people that don't have jobs that should have jobs. I think that we should have a much more vibrant economy. We should have a much higher standard of living. There should be a lot more opportunity. But it's not because we don't have enough government is because we have too much. And it's the problems that we have on Wall Street. We're not a function of capitalism, but a function of the government's failure to allow capitalism. And the reason that I was predicting the 2008 financial crisis and they were calling me doctor doom. The reason I, I knew about the housing bubble in advance and I was able to see the financial crisis coming was because I understood the dynamics at play. I understood how the government, how the Federal Reserve, how their policies we're working to inflate these bubbles. And I understood the moral hazards and the consequences of what was going on.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       And so when I went down as a Cottey Park, the point I was trying to make, and not even so much the people that were protesting, but to the people who I knew would watch the interaction all around the world was to make the point that you are right to be upset, but you're, you're, you're, you're venting your anger in the wrong direction. They're inventing, they're angry or people at you like you and a successful, the quote unquote one 1% capitalism. And I would say, look, it's the Federal Reserve that is the source of your problems. It's congress. It's the White House. It's not the financial district in New York City. I mean the free market people in the free market are there to help you write anyone in anyone that has a business, all they're trying to do is win your business as a customer there. They're competing to get you to buy things and anything that you buy, right? If choose to buy something,

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       if I buy something for 20 bucks, I must value what I'm buying more than 20 bucks or I wouldn't make the exchange. So to the extent that there's a business out there trying to convince me to buy something that I value more than money, that's not going to hurt me. The problem is government. Government has power, government has brute force. The government can force me to do things that I don't want to do. The government can make my life worse. A private business, it's just going to make my life better, right? Because if they're not going to make my life better, I don't do business with them. But the government is a different story. They can pass laws, they can pass taxes, they can best regulations. And as it so happens, the laws and regulations that they're passing are making people's lives worse. And you know, the problem wasn't that big banks failed.

Speaker 4:          00:36:20       The problem was that they got bailed out. Don't blame the banks for accepting the bail out. I mean, what would you do if someone offered to bail you out? Yeah, you'd take the money. The problem is the government, the government shouldn't have had the power to bail him out in the first place so that the real enemy is government and the power that government has. We have to take that power away from government. And what, when you take power away from government, you create freedom, right? That's what freedom is. It's absence of government. Right? Now, when you say the Federal Reserve and Congress or the real issue, what is their incentive to be that issue? What is their incentive to not allow the market to thrive and to like you're saying that they're the reason why there aren't more opportunities and there aren't more people working? What?

Speaker 4:          00:37:02       What are, what is, what does, what do they have to gain? Well, Paul, what are they doing? Politicians have power, right? They want the money to get elected and they want all the perks that come with elected office. Uh, most people that are in government live pretty good lives. There's a reason to do it right. It's not that they want to serve the people will help the people. They want a personal benefit. Yeah. I mean, that's all it, that's all the nonsense, right? They all pretend that they're public servants, but that's, that, that's that Spiel, right? That they're, they're all there. They're, they're acting. They're, they're playing a part that's a, that's a means to an end. They want the power. They want the perks that come with elected office. And so obviously in order to get elected, you've got to get the votes. You got to get the contributions.

Speaker 4:          00:37:44       And so they're not making policy. That's good economics. All they're trying to do is get elected and get donations. And so they have a vested interest in helping the people that give them money. And people are always trying to buy special perks from government, uh, a tax break or you know, put these, you know, regulate my competitor instead of me or put this guy out of business. And of course a lot of people just vote for something for free. That was the power of Bernie Sanders. I'll give you free stuff, right? Both from me. And there are a lot of people who don't know any better and they're just going to vote for whoever it promises the most free stuff. But free stuff isn't free. It's very expensive. But what it really amounts to is theft. I mean, the liberal say, vote for me and I'm going to steal from somebody else and give you what I take because the government doesn't have anything the government doesn't have, you know, if they're going to promise something, they have to take it from somebody else. They don't have anything. Government

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       doesn't produce government just redistributes what other people produce. So there's always a cost. But whenever the government does that, when they taxed the productive people to give money to nonproductive people, they increased the incentive not to produce. And they decrease the incentive to produce. So all this redistribution of wealth just means that there's a lot less wealth to redistribute and everybody ends up poor. If the politicians stayed out of it, then you'd have a lot more wealth and everybody would be better off. But that's not, you know, the politics of it are the things that are good economics are bad politics. Like, like take, take, uh, healthcare. Why couldn't the Republicans Repeal Obamacare, right? Because obamacare is terrible economics. But here's the problem. How is it terribly economics.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       We're going to get into this. The last time you were here. Yeah, we got sidetracked. What, what is terrible about it?

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       Well, I mean, I mean we could spend the whole show on why it's bad economics, but you know, there's a belief out there that government is somehow going to be a more efficient provider of health care than the free market, which is just not true. Right? I mean, healthcare is a surface, right? Just like food, just like shelter, just like clothing and the free market can provide it better and cheaper than government. I mean, that's just always the case. Some people like it as a service.

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       So that becomes a part of what the government offers you along with, you know, when you pay your taxes, they fixed the roads, they hire the police, things along those lines. They would like healthcare to be along that line as well, just like it is in the UK and in Canada and,

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       and you know, and in some ways those systems are better than the system we have now, but they're not better than the system we used to have or better than the system that we could have if it was a pure free market, you know? But that, that, there's two things you got right, you've got healthcare and then you've got the health insurance, right? Let's look at those two, those two industries separately because the reason that people buy health insurance, right, is in case, well, if I get really sick, I can't afford the bills, right? Just like, you know, people buy car insurance, right? When you buy car insurance, you know that you still have to pay for gas. You know, you don't expect your car insurance policy to cover the cost of gas. It doesn't cover the cost of new tires. It doesn't cover the cost of a new spark plugs or your routine maintenance.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       The reason you buy auto insurances, Hey, what if I get into a wreck and I total my car, I don't have the cash to buy a new one. So people buy insurance because they're insuring against something. That's probably not going to happen, right? When you buy your auto insurance, the anticipation is that you never put in a claim and you're happy to never put into a claim. And the insurance company, obviously it doesn't want you to put in a claim. They're hoping that they collect the premiums. And the way auto insurance works is because most people don't put in a claim because they don't get into an accident. The insurance company has the money to pay the people who do get an accident, right. And that's how insurance works. But because of the government health insurance then work that way anymore. Right. Because of the government and the government's set up the system where if I hire somebody and I pay them cash, they have to pay income taxes on it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       If I give them health insurance instead of cash, it's tax free. So a lot of people all of a sudden wanted health insurance instead of cash because they didn't have to pay tax on health insurance. And now more and more people started to want their health insurance to cover the equivalent of more gas in my car or a flat tire. And the minute you try to pay for your routine medical costs with a third party payer through health insurance, you have these spiraling out of control costs. You know, because if you never, if you pulled up to a gas station, it didn't actually pay for the gas. You just like put your, your gas, your credit, you're a insurance card into the pump and they didn't even have prices. Because when you go to the doctor, you don't even know what things cost. There's no prices.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       I mean, when you go to buy gas, everybody has the price right up there. And I look around and if one place is 2 cents cheaper, that's where I'm going. Right? So, but if, if the gas stations didn't even bother to put the price, and I said, what do you care what the gas costs? The insurance companies paid for it, right? I mean, that's what we have with the healthcare system. We have a system that government created where people rely on health insurance to pay for everything. Health insurance should just be for very expensive things that are probably not going to happen to you, right? I, I get hit by a car, I get cancer. You shouldn't use your health insurance every time you go to the doctor. And if we got, if we got people to pay for their health insurance, the way they pay for their, their, their auto insurance or the life insurance, if we separate health insurance from employment, health insurance will be much cheaper.

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       You know, it's the government that married the two, right? And that's why people say, well, if you lose your job, you lose your healthcare. That's because the government fix the tax code. And people, you know, you don't lose your auto insurance when you lose your job. But the other important thing, and here's why obamacare doesn't work. See the thesis of Obamacare was, Hey, let's make it so that insurance companies can't discriminate against people that have a preexisting condition, right? So they can't charge people more money just because they happen to be sick. Right? This was one of the appeals of it. Now, here's the problem with that. The only reason people buy insurance when they're healthy health insurance is because they know they can't buy it when they're sick. Like let's say with the auto insurance, if there was a law that said that, or auto insurance companies couldn't discriminate based on preexisting conditions. If you can buy the policy after your accident and get coverage for the same price as if you bought it before, right? Nobody would buy auto insurance. You would just wait until you had an accident.

Speaker 3:          00:44:18       Auto Insurance, a weird argument because auto insurance is mandatory. Like you have to have it where health insurance not mandatory. Well it's obamacare kind of makes it mandatory, right? You're just saying it's mentoring for the wrong aspects of Eve insurance that

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       it covers the wrong things. Well even look, fire insurance isn't mandatory either. Oh No. Insurance is in certain states it is and of course not all coverages mandatory and you know you haven't pulsory coverage. You have to have some which is similar to what you're talking about with health insurance. Compulsory health insurance, like for catastrophic injuries. Well they made it, they obamacare made it compulsory gives. The point is this that if auto insurance was not compulsory, right and you can just decide whether or not you wanted it. If there was a law that said that insurance companies couldn't discriminate, nobody would buy it because you would just wait until after you had an accident. But the problem is not just that. Well the reason why auto insurance is a bad example is because you are going to hit my car and you going to do damage to me.

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       Have you have no insurance on your car. I'm not going to be you run into you on the street and collide with my body and hurt you. I somehow now I don't have health insurance and so you get injured from me. I look, just don't you think that's a different argument rather than even make that argument, let's just go to fire insurance cause there's only one person involved me. So I have a house. You know, would I buy fire insurance if I can go to an insurance company after my house already burns down and by the policy for the same price? So the reason that people buy fire insurance policies before their house burns down is because they know that nobody will sell them a policy after it burns down. And the insurance companies couldn't stay in business if the only people who were buying policies where people whose houses already burnt down.

Speaker 2:          00:45:55       I agree with you. So here's what happened with obamacare. So Obama says we're gonna make it. So insurance companies can't discriminate against people who are sick. Well, the result of that is no healthy person's going to want to buy insurance. It's a waste of money. Why pay premiums when you're not sick? Wait until you get sick. So what am I can't discriminate against you because you have a preexisting condition. So the way Obama tried to combat that was, okay, we're going to force people to buy insurance. We're going to, we're going to require employers to provide it. And if you know you don't get it from your employer, we're going to find you. You're going to have a penalty if you don't buy the insurance right now. Two things about that. One, the penalties were too low, right? Because the penalty for not buying insurance is so cheap that it's cheaper to not buy insurance, pay the penalty, and then wait until you get sick to by the insurance.

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       That's why the insurance companies are losing all this money, and that's why premiums are skyrocketing because nobody wants to buy because the punished if the penalties were too low. But politically, everybody likes the idea that insurance companies can't discriminate based on preclinical. So what the Republicans tried to do was have their cake and eat it too. They said to the voters, we're going to keep the ban on preexisting conditions, but we're going to get rid of the mandates. We're going to get rid of the penalties. We're going to get rid of this. You can't do that. You have to have both. The real problem was the taxes were too, the penalties were too low. They needed the jack those penalties up because so many people were paying the penalty and not buying the insurance. But the reality is we need a free market insurance because the Republicans want to say you should be able to buy the type of coverage that you want. You should be

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       able to buy the kind of inch, which is true, but then insurance companies have to be able to deny you coverage. If they don't want to cover you, they have to be able to charge you more if you're already sick. I mean the only way to have inexpensive insurance is for the insurance companies to discriminate and to charge people more money if they're already sick. And it's because of that. That's why healthy people buy policies because they know, hey, let me buy it now why I'm healthy, because if I happen to get sick and it's going to be a lot more expensive. So what the, what the government is trying to do is just trying to destroy the market for health insurance. Meanwhile, the costs are skyrocketing, insurance is getting more expensive. Healthcare is getting more expensive. If you go back to the days before the government was involved, uh, healthcare was not a problem.

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       It wasn't expensive. You know, in the 1920s, 1930 [inaudible] 1940 [inaudible] 1950s, healthcare was not expensive. People didn't worry about medical bills. They were not high. If you needed a catastrophic insurance, it was inexpensive. If you had to go to the doctor, it wasn't expensive. You know, people didn't even worry about it because it was cool or is quality care and it was at a low cost. And with all the advancements that we've had in medicine, with all the technology, with all the drugs that are here, healthcare should be cheaper today than it was in 1940 [inaudible] and 1950s on a, on a real basis. You know, and I hear all the time people make the argument, well, the reason that healthcare is more expensive because it's more complicated now because we do all these things that we didn't do well. If that were true, then why isn't my cell phone today more expensive than a cell phone 10 or 20 years ago?

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       Is it as does more expensive? No, it's certainly ends. It's just you get subsidized by your, your company, no matter who you are, the they, they drag out the payments. They like, if you buy a cell phone from verizon, they're not selling you the full. Like if you buy an iphone seven they're not selling it to you at the full rate. The full rate would be like 1,012 hundred bucks. Yes. But I paid $1,000 in the 1980s for my first cell phone that didn't do jack compared with this very early days of Gordon Gekko ones. I've got this Mac Mac book air in front of me here. And so this back book air, obviously this is a a, you know, cost me like 12 1400 bucks. My first computer that I had in college was an apple, two e and that computer and I got a dot matrix printer and I had a floppy disk and my dad spent almost $5,000 on it in 1981 and all it was was a glorified word processor, right? So obviously the power in this computer is so much greater than the one that I had in that apple two e yet it's less expensive. Even forgetting about adjusting for inflation, it's actually cheaper in actual dollars and did, despite the fact that it's more complicated. And my point is that just because something is more complicated and more doesn't mean it's going to be more expensive. Healthcare today should be cheaper. All of this, all of the new technology be bringing down

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       the cost of medicine. The reason it's not is because of government's involvement. Cause if government was involved in the computer industry the same way it's involved in healthcare, then we would see skyrocketing computer prices that, you know, okay, so now why does the government, and you're saying that the government wants to destroy the insurance industry, that they don't want to, not adroit as troy, but what, why do they want to complicate it the way I do think? Well, first of all, I don't think they're smart enough to destroy it on purpose. I mean, it's just the unintended consequences. They're trying to get votes, they're trying to get elected. And of course, you know, people want something for nothing. So number one, you know, you get a lot of votes by promising free healthcare, right? So number one, but also why do the insurance companies, because there are massive subsidies for insurance companies, right?

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       If I can get the government to require people to buy my product, then I don't have to offer a good product. Right? I mean, when she, wouldn't you like to government to require everybody to listen to the Joe Rogan podcast? If that was mandatory, super furious at me. Well, it's exactly the way it is, but although, but you know, but there are a lot of businesses rather than having to win. Well maybe if you had a lousy podcasts that nobody listened to, you'd want the government to say, Hey, too many people are listening to Joe Rogan forced them to listen to my podcast instead. So, you know, you have these big healthcare companies or insurance companies that want something from government. They want the government to mandate people buy their product or protect them from competition. No, you can't. If you wanted to buy an insurance policy from a Japanese company or a Swiss company, you can't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       They can't. Some Swiss company can't come over here to California. Hell, they won't even let companies from other states sell you policies. I mean, why is that? We need more competition. But government is protecting companies from having to compete with one another so they don't have to do as good a job. But Obama was already in office, right when he was trying to do this. Well, what was the incentive for trying to pass this once he's already an office, a wants to get reelected, which he did. He did get reelected, but there's a lot of political pay off. You have to, you know, pay off the people that help put you in office and you know, he wants to help other Democrats get elected, you know, and, and, and maintain, maintain that power. But nobody ever debate this with him in this sort of a rational, pragmatic way.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       The way you're laying it out right now, I have no idea. You know, and you don't know when it comes to a politician, you don't know if they're doing stupid things because they're stupid or because they don't care that they're done. They're just the ramifications of what they're trying to propose and why, as I said, either either that people believe in liberal philosophy or these programs, either because they're ignorant or because they have an ulterior motive right there. There are probably some politicians there that are actually dumb enough to think that this is a good idea, right? Like we talked about the minimum wage. There are some people that actually believe that it's a good thing, right? They don't know how bad it is, but they're doing it because they're, they're thinking with their hearts and not with their heads, but there are probably some people who support the minimum wage knowing that it's bad, but they know it's good politics or they're afraid to come out against it because that's such bad politics.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       So you don't for sure. If somebody is in favor of something, do they actually realize how bad it is? Right, and they're doing it anyway. Are they just dumb enough to actually believe it? I have to say if you adjust for inflation, you're probably right about cell phones. So I'm thinking now like a Motorola startac. Oh yeah. How much were those? Those were expensive. How much were they when they came out? I think there were like five or 600 bucks, but if you adjust for inflation about how much it costs to use them, that's the big one. The roaming costs were extraordinary, but even if you didn't roam I distance and long distance. My first plan, I think when I was in, I had my first phone and I think it was like 70 80 bucks a month. And I had like a half hour of talk time.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       Right. So I would, if someone called me on my cell phone, I was quick because I had to quickly get off because if you went over your minutes, you know, now I have unlimited, not only is it unlimited, I can talk, I get, I can see people, I see their faces, I could talk to people in other countries. Now there's companies that are offering unlimited data too, just cause there, because we didn't even have database keating. Yes. Because there can be, okay. It was 1000 bucks. Oh, so wrong. See, especially if you adjust for inflation. Oh yeah. And then just reinflation of a startac phone, which was a piece of shit comparatively. It was amazing at the time. And the battery lasted like a half an hour, 45 minutes of, you know, and so a brand new iphone, it's probably like 1200 so yeah, you adjust for inflation. You right?

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       Now, when you're talking about Bernie Sanders and you're talking about some of the policies that that guy was proposing and some of this, the idea of, you know, Robin hooding the whole deal taking from the rich and giving to the poor, that's extremely appealing to people, right? How do you, how do you lay it out to people in a way that they can understand that although this looks like a great idea, that this is not a good idea and ultimately it's not going to benefit you. It's going to make things stagnant. It's gonna make things harder for business and it's gonna make things harder for jobs. A lot of people listening right now to even me saying that they're tweeting me to get mad. You fucking a shill. You sell out you 1% or you piece of shit. I, that's the thought process between Eh, behind anybody who says anything even remotely negative about socialism, that you have to be some sort of a sellout or you just want to keep things the way they are so that you can benefit.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       And it's amazing that so many people find socialism appealing. Yet they'll say, Oh, you know, fascism is really bad. Right? The Nazis were really bad. They don't realize that the Nazi party that stands for national socialism, that's what it was. It's national social. So socialism is a broader economic theory that encompasses cat, uh, communism and fascism. They're both forms of socialism. So, you know, yeah, it's all bad. Right? And the whole idea, the, all the whole premise of socialism is bad. It, you know, it, the free market being a libertarian is all about the individual. It's about freedom and, and, and, and recognizing the value of, of the individual and their rights to pursue their own self interest or own happiness property. But in, in your question, how do you talk to people and get them to see how bad socialism is? I mean, I mean, first of all, I mean, look at the countries that have tried it in its extreme form, right?

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       Whether it was like the Soviet Union or a North Korea or Cuba or East Germany, you could look at examples where you had people moving in this direction. These promises of, you know, from each, according to his ability to each according to his need and it was a disaster. So it's not like we don't have a long history of failed socialist experiments. And you know, you can look at the countries that are the most prosperous and those are the countries that have the least amount of socialism. I mean, obviously, you know, socialism is going to exist in a certain degree. It's hard to find any place on the earth now where there isn't some elements of socialism that have crept into the economy. But the extent that countries have managed to limit the amount of socialist policies they have, they have maximized the standard of living of their people.

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       So the more like look at Venezuela, right? I mean people, you know, and I, I uh, and president, um, uh, uh, uh, trump was tweeting out not too long ago. Oh, you know, he's, he's upset that they don't have enough democracy. We need more democracy. They don't need more democracy. Democracy is what got them into trouble because they voted for socialists. What they need in Venezuela is more capitalism. They need more freedom, not just more people voting for other socialists. Notice of the appeal of socialism. Essentially the same appeal of turning Puerto Rico into a state that you're going to get something for it. It's going to benefit the people. Yeah, I mean people, you know, like the idea of getting something for nothing. And you know, there is a certain, if you think of that superficially, and that's why you know there's an old expression, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       If you're not socialists by the time you're 20 you don't have a heart. But if you're not a concern, by the time you're 30 you don't have a brain. It's because people are caring. I mean, in general, most people care about their fellow human beings, including conservatives and libertarians. I mean they care to just at. A lot of liberals think that conservatives are mean because they don't support these programs. It's not because they're mean, it's just that they recognize the unintended consequences of these programs, that the programs actually make it worse for the people that you're trying to help. But younger people who don't have as much real world experience, they don't know any better. So it's very easy to be a socialist when you're 16 1718 you'd never had a job. You've never run a company, you don't have much real world experience, but you're carrying human being.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       So I don't fault young people for being socialists, but I do. But when you get to your thirties and your forties and you haven't grown up, to me that's like a little kid still believing in Santa Claus. Right. How come you didn't learn anything? Right. Here's Bernie Sanders. He's like, you know what is he 70 something years old and he's, he thinks like as a teenager, I mean he didn't learn anything from all this life experience. You know, he's, he it, he didn't get any smarter because it doesn't need to have a bunch of houses. I think Bernie owns a few houses. Yeah, I think he does. And didn't mean one of the, he's in hot water right now because his wife, yes. Why she decided to go full on capitalists for this small college and buy up a bunch of land. And the, the company went bankrupt.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       Yup. The college, which is essentially company, right? The way that you can get young people to understand, look, most people, even if they're not in the 1%, they want to get to the 1% right. Every body. Some people would say that's not true. Some people would say, no, that's not what I want. I want to be comfortable and I want to pursue whatever my interests are. Why? But what, and again, and what are those interests? I mean people and be their art. Maybe it's, yeah, but they still have to eat. They still have, they still need clothes. So we just wanted to be comfortable. They don't necessarily want to be a white person, but you're going to get those things better from the free market. The free market is going to make you more comfortable than a government program. And if you're just trying to have a shortcut and say, look, you know, just steal some money from that rich person and give it to me.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       But most people even don't just want to squeak by. I mean most people want to achieve something. They want to strive to get the most they can out of life. And you know, you know, if you want to get a job, I mean somebody has to hire you, somebody has to have the capital, somebody has to be able to pay you, right? You, you're not going to get a job from a poor person. Right. They don't have anything to offer. They don't have capital to give you. They can't pay, you know, write a paycheck. You know, so people understand, hey, I got my first job from somebody in the 1%. Okay. You know, and now I'm, I'm in the 1% myself because I, you know, I was able to gain some experience, gain some knowledge, you know, so you could talk to younger people and really show them the different, a different path.

Speaker 2:          01:00:52       One is, you know, relying on government and thievery. Cause that's really, you know, most people would agree that theft is wrong, right? If the two of us got together and beat you up, although obviously we can't, but as soon as we could, we beat you up. And we took your money. You would say that's wrong, right? You can't do that. Well, if we got together and voted for congressman to take your money, you know, we outvoted you two to one. Why is that any any better? I mean, why is it okay to steal through the ballot box, but it's not okay to do it directly. So the argument against that would be that it's not stealing, that you're just creating policies that even the playing field and that stealing people that are in the 1% like these hedge fund dudes that have these giant houses in the Hamptons, they've accumulated massive amounts of wealth and they're using that to influence politicians and change laws and they shouldn't be able to use it to influence politicians.

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       That's why we have to take the influence away from politicians, take away that power. But there is a wealthy hedge fund guy. That doesn't mean I have the right to go steal his Maserati just because he's rich and I don't have the right to tax him to take that maserati either. It's, it's just another form of theft. When you believe in the free market, libertarian, you know you're giving somebody that I did. Look, you don't have to get rich by stealing with somebody else has. You can do it on your own and you know you, you can benefit from what other people have because the only way people get rich and a free market is by delivering service is that other people value. The only exception is if you get rich through government connections. And that is not a fault of capitalism. That is a fault of when you empower government to sell favors for the highest bidder.

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       That is not an indictment of capitalism. That is socialism, right? And so that's what we have to stamp out. We have to make sure that you can't succeed by bribing a politician, that you can't use government power to create wealth. That if you want to get wealthy, you have to be wealthy as a result of voluntary interactions with other human beings without government involvement, right? Government is there to protect my rights, protect my property, protect my life from other people who might infringe upon my rights from people who could steal it. But government is not there to give you things. It's not there to give you a job. It's not there to give you a health care. You need to earn those things on your own. And now obviously, are there going to be people who are just born, they're just not. They may be they have deformities or they're not smart enough or they have handy some kind of and they can't fend for themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       Yes, I recognize that, but my solution for that is not to, is not to steal from some wealthy person and say and give the money to somebody who needs it. I believe in voluntary charity. I believe that human beings care enough about other human beings that if somebody really is in a dire circumstance, that private charity, we'll take care of them. And what I do know is when you have private charity, right, it's very efficient, right? If, if, if you donate a dollar to a charity, 90 cents is going to go to the people who need money. Ideally, we have obviously some massive exceptions to that, but with the government, the government will take a dollar in taxes and only 10 cents will go to the poor people. The rest of it goes to the government bureaucracy. And the problem with government is when you have a private organization, they really want to do good, right?

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       I mean you have these government antipoverty programs, they don't want to end poverty. They want to expand poverty. They want, they want more poverty because then their program gets bigger. Then they have more power. The last thing they want to do is end poverty because now they're, they no longer have a job. So they're not there to try to make sure that the people who are getting the aid actually need the aid. I mean, it's different when it's private money and private charity, uh, you know, there, you're really trying to do good instead of just perpetuate the poverty so you can grow your power base. Have you ever sat down with Bernie Sanders? No. Wouldn't you love to, when you love to have a debate with him, like a long form conversation, like a three hour podcasts? I wouldn't, I wouldn't shy away from it. I mean, I, I, you know, I do know he's, he's sold at this point that it's hard to believe that I'm going to persuade him that he's wrong, that he's going to come to his, you know, after living in entire life believing in something.

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       Well, I'm not even necessarily saying that you would persuade him, but it would be nice to see people counter, you know, or hear rather the counter to his arguments that he puts forth that are very appealing to a lot of these young people that you're talking about. If you're 20 and you're not a liberal, you don't have a heart, you know that these, these ideas are very pervasive in our culture and they were thought to be the solution to the ails that were in, they were thought to be the solutions to the problems with the bailout. Why is the government getting all this money and giving it to the banks when they could be giving it to poor people and, and propping up the income inequality like that,

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       that, that conversation. And now we're big problem. And I knew that at the beginning because see I was, I was against the bailouts, but I knew that when the government bails out banks, now you've created a precedent. Wait a minute, if you're going to bail out those banks, why not bail out the little guy? Right. And I have a lot of sympathy for that argument, but I don't think two wrongs make a right. We shouldn't have bailed out the banks. See the government shouldn't steal money from, from one person and give it to somebody else. You know, regardless of who they're there, they're there, they're giving it to. But once you create that precedent, and of course, you know, a lot of people should have been allowed to lose money in that financial crisis. A lot of banks should have failed. A lot of people should have lost their jobs and they didn't.

Speaker 4:          01:05:59       And so that's a moral hazard because the government created a condition and said, hey, if you're going to speculate and do all these things, you know, you know, we're going to bail you out. And you know, it wasn't, you have to realize that it was the government, the government was guaranteeing all those mortgages. The governor was guaranteeing all those bank banks, bank deposits. The government was through Fannie and Freddie, encouraging reckless activity, encouraging banks to make loans to people who they knew couldn't pay it back. I mean, all this was rooted in government incentives and government subsidies. If there was a pure free market, the banks would not be able to assume all that risk. But because the government, you know, had their back then they were be able, they were able to do things that the free market never would have allowed. That's why for years, you know, while the housing bubble was going up, I was pointing this stuff out.

Speaker 4:          01:06:43       I mean, you go and you know, look at some of the youtube videos, um, you know, for all of my appearances back then that eventually became that Peter Schiff was right video. Um, I understood the, the ultimate consequences of what the government was doing, you know, but then the bailouts just, you know, allowed the government, like the government never wants to waste a crisis. They always want to use the crisis to get bigger, to get more power. We should have learned something from the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, we have repeated all the mistakes, right. Everything that has been done by Janet Yellen and Ben Bernakie, since the financial crisis has actually made the u s economy worse, we're in much worse shape now, economically. So I think the crisis that we're coming to, the next one is going to be much worse than the one we had to know.

Speaker 4:          01:07:30       Eight to get to that in a second. But what, what was the argument for the bailout? Well, the argument for the bailout was that the banks were just so big, right? They were, they were interconnected. Yeah. And that if we let them fail, it's just going to be so much worse. Right. Cause it's just, you know, we got, you know, we, we got to a bail amount because, you know, even though it's bad, it'll be worse if we don't do it. People like me and maybe Jamie had money in these banks and that money would dissolve. Well people would have lost, certainly would deposit of, had lost some money. Yes they would have. But you know, I agree that had we not done the bailouts, it would have been worse, but it would have been healthy. It would have been a step in the right direction.

Speaker 4:          01:08:12       You know, you, you know, you work out, it's like no pain, no gain. I mean, you know, like, you know, we, we, you've got to bite the bullet on this and, and, and, and, and do what's right. Or I look at it like, you know, we were strung out on cheap money. We were like a drug addict. And had we just gone cold Turkey and gone into Rehab, yeah. It would have been a big downer. Right. It wouldn't have been pleasant. And we would had to go through all this stuff, but at the end of the day we could emerge healthy instead models

Speaker 3:          01:08:42       being projected, projected, like did bid, people look at the two possibilities, like having no bail out and we were looking at us here in nine years later or having available,

Speaker 4:          01:08:52       well, you know, I don't think they, if they looked at anything, it was just very short term, right. Because all these guys are politically motivated, right? An election is coming up, right. Because all the bailouts happened, uh, in, uh, summer of Oh eight, a lot of big ones. And the election was in November of [inaudible] eight. Right. I remember John Mccain interrupted his presidential campaign to come vote for a tarp bailout. And, and so politicians can't see beyond the next election. And if your horizon is that short, yes, the bailouts ease the pain, but at the cost of exacerbating the underlying disease, that is the cause of the pain. So because we did all the wrong things and o eight o nine o 10, instead of fixing the problems and having a healthy recovery, we have the weakest recovery in the history of recoveries. In fact, I don't even think it's a recovery cause I think the average American is sicker now than he was when the recovery began.

Speaker 4:          01:09:47       Well, you look at personal net worth has gone down. Real incomes have gone down. We've eviscerated the labor force. I mean people have lost good paying jobs and they now have two or three low paying part time jobs. People are working longer for less. Uh, their net worths of gone down. They're loaded up with debt. We now have record high cardio loans, record high credit card debt record, high student loans. The only thing we don't have as record mortgage debt. And that's because home ownership is now at a 60 year low. But we do have rising rents and so our standard of living is falling, uh, because we didn't do the right thing. But because we didn't do the right thing, this next crisis, as I said, is going to be so much worse where we're just going from crisis to crisis because nobody has the guts to do the right thing because in the short run it means they might not get reelected, right?

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       Nobody wants to get reelected, promising. You know what? Things are bad. We've made a lot of mistakes. We're going to have to suffer through this recession. People are going to lose money. People are going to lose their jobs, but you know what? Don't worry. The free market is going to work. You'll get different jobs. You'll get your, you know, nobody has the guts to tell the truth to the voters. Everyone wants to pretend that they've got, you know, it's like, you know, by my Miracle Cure, you don't have to work out. You don't have to die it just rub this cream on your, your thighs and the side lights going to go away. That's what people want. They don't want to be told, you gotta hit the gym and you've got to stop eating junk food. They want the miracle cream. That's the guy that gets the vote.

Speaker 4:          01:11:10       So we set ourselves up for, I think a crisis, not just a financial crisis where were mortgages are in trouble, but we're, the dollar itself is collapsing, our money is collapsing, prices are skyrocketing. It's going to really hit the average American much more than just the stock market going down. But when your money is going down, right, when the cost of living is skyrocketing, right, that is going to be a big problem for a lot of people, that that's where we're headed. It's ultimately going to be a dollar crisis. And that's really, you know, like my, in my business in my brokerage firm and Euro Pacific capital, that's what I've tried to do is help people protect their wealth by getting out of US dollar assets by investing in Singapore and Switzerland and New Zealand and Hong Kong and other countries owning other assets, you know, to try to protect themselves from this crisis that you know is coming. You know, and most people are going to get blindsided by just like they were by the last one.

Speaker 3:          01:12:02       So what is the crisis and how exactly do you feel it's going to go down? Because I did watch some of your videos about the housing crisis from 2008 you're predicting it years in advance. Yeah, I mean look, you know, things always happen, you know, I see things years before they happen cause like you're not the only one, right? No. This is something amongst your peers and your colleagues, you guys are all discussing this. Well, I mean, I mean there are people, oh

Speaker 4:          01:12:24       most people who feel the way I do maybe aren't, they weren't on television saying it. They were saying it to their buddies, you know, in their own living rooms and they were getting laughed at just like I was, you know, I guess I used to get emails from people, Hey, I've been saying this is exactly what I've been saying and everybody thinks I'm crazy and you know, it's just, you know, they're the same one. It's everybody else. That's crazy. That just, it gets caught up in it. But what's going to happen is we are going to go back at some point into another statistic. Recession. I mean I think that we've kind of been in one this whole recovery cause I don't think the government numbers are really that accurate. I don't think that inflation is as low as they claim at least as measured by the consumer prices.

Speaker 4:          01:13:03       So I think that the economy has actually been contracting during the years that we've been pretending it's been growing. But I do think at some point statistically we will go back into a technical recession where even the government admits that the economy shrinking, right where the GDP is negative for a couple of quarters in a row and then what is the government going to do as a result of that? They're going to do exactly what they did before. They're going to take interest rates and bring them back to zero from wherever they are. The differences. Normally they lower interest rates and then by the time there's another recession their way back up, four or five 6% this time they, they barely got him back to 1% and they kept them at zero for seven, eight years, which is unprecedented. And of course the mistakes that are made are consequence of money being too cheap, right?

Speaker 4:          01:13:48       The reason that we had a real estate bubble, the main reason was because Alan Greenspan lowered interest rates to 1% and left them there for about a year and a half and then took about a year and a half to rise to raise him back up to normal. So you had a few years of artificially low interest rates and that gave us this huge housing bubble. Well, we had seven, eight years of zero. I mean the, the mistakes that had been made under Obama dwarfs the mistakes that were made under Bush. And these are mistakes that are a consequence of money being too cheap of the government setting the price of money as opposed to the free market. You get too much debt, you get too much speculation. And so we've got a much bigger bubble now and when the, this one pops because it's so much bigger, right? So then all of a sudden the Fed has to cut interest rates again.

Speaker 4:          01:14:31       And now what happens to the dollar? Because see the dollar has been rising in these past few years because everybody thought, oh, the Fed's going to normalize interest rates. The Fed is going to shrink the balance sheet when none of this stuff happens. When the Fed goes back to another round of quantitative easing, when they got to crank up the printing presses, when they don't shrink the balance sheet, but they bloat even bigger, right? It goes to five and a half trillion, six and a half trillion. I think the bottom's to drop out of the dollar. I think the dollar is going to get killed. The opposite of what happened in Oh eight when the financial crisis hit no aid, the dollar had been falling for seven years. It was at an all time record low, and then when the crisis hit, it actually caused people to buy the dollar.

Speaker 4:          01:15:09       Uh, but I think this next crisis is going to be the big sell signal for the dollar. It's because people are going to rush out of the dollar as the Fed has to go back to more qe as people realize that this is what I said from the beginning, this is a monetary roach motel, right? The Fed checked us in and they ain't checking us out. There's no way to normalize rates. There's no way to shrink the balance sheet, and when people realize that this is a permanent situation, the bottom drops out of the dollar and then commodity prices really start to rise. Remember when oil prices went from like $20 a barrel and 19 and 2001 up to 150 right? That was happening because the dollar was falling and as the dollar starts to fall, all these commodity prices are gonna rise again and now inflation is really going to pick up the way they measure it and the, the governor can't do anything about it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:54       They can't raise interest rates because if they raise interest rates, they collapse everything. All the banks that were too big to fail. They're bigger now, and it would be even worse if they failed. So they can't let rates go up because banks absorbed other banks, they got bigger, and now you have all these banks that have all these long term loans that have low coupons on them. If interest rates go up, all these big banks are going to fail. I mean, people think rising rates are going to be good for banks. They're gonna destroy the banks. They're gonna destroy the housing market. I mean, and the government, this is the biggest thing. Look at the national debt. The national debt is about 20 trillion, the bonded debt. And that, of course, that doesn't even count all the unfunded liabilities. That's just where the government has sold a bond, right?

Speaker 4:          01:16:33       A treasury bond, that's about 20 trillion. But what would happen if interest rates went to 10% well, it would cost the government $2 trillion a year just to pay the interest on that 20,000 on the 20 trillion we don't have anywhere close to that. I mean, right now, interest rates are almost zero. And we're spending about 250 billion a year on interest. But if interest rates actually went up because the Fed had to fight inflation, the treasurer would have to default. They would have to tell the cro, we can't pay on these bonds. What are you showing me? Jamie's this, the national debt. The national debt is 20 trillion yet. Oh, it's so clause 19

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       nine seven three looking at spinning. Oh God. Yeah, I know it. Terrific. But um, and so obviously the Fed has to keep interest rates low so the government can service that debt. Look at Medicare, Medicaid, Jesus Christ. What is happening? You add it all up. You didn't even a billion. Is that a trillion? Huh? What does that right there? What is that? No, that's one point. 1 trillion. Oh, it is. That's a lot of those budget items. Those are budget items. That's the budget. Social Security, that's not the debt. That's what they're spending. Oh, see, look at those numbers. If you go down lower you, they'll probably have all the unfunded liabilities that page somewhere, you know, and then they break it down and they break it down per capita, per tax payer. I mean, it's an art, but my point is that we've got like an adjustable rate mortgage on that national debt.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       The government, Scot ultra cheap money. If interest rates spike, there's no way that the government can pay that debt. This is hypnotic. It really is terrifying. They're seen it before. I've never seen it before either. That's why I'm saying Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico, it'd be, it would be so idiotic for Puerto Rico to want to join the union and absorb their share of that debt. Now, for the average person like myself, was zero understanding of the financial system. You listen to trump, talk about the economy booming and it's on an upward the thing and the unemployment is down and jobs are up.

Speaker 4:          01:18:30       Yeah, I mean bullshit. Yeah. That's what's really bothering me about trump is the hypocrisy. Because when trump was a candidate and he got elected, because by and large he told the truth about the phony nature of the recovery. Obama was out there talking about how great things were, and trump was like, bs. It's not great. Oh, you're talking about low unemployment. That number is bogus. The real unemployment rate is 20% or 25% is people stopped looking for jobs and it doesn't count anymore. People are, you know, they gave up looking. So they don't have a job. They're not counted as being unemployed. And he pointed out that all the jobs like here, this is irony, right? So what are the byproducts of obamacare? Obamacare said that if you have a full time worker, you have to give him health insurance. Right? And full time was anyone that worked 30 hours or more?

Speaker 4:          01:19:16       Well, employers aren't dumb. They can do math. Hey, if I, if this guy is working 40 hours a week, I got, I got to give them health insurance, which is very expensive. But if he works 29 hours a week, I don't. Right. So what happened? Employers started transitioning their workforces from full time workers to part time workers. Well, what happens if I'm going to have only part time workers, I'm going to have more workers, Greg, because each one is working fewer hours. So I'm going to have to have more. I have more jobs, right? If I have, if I had 500 part time jobs, but now I have a thousand, I mean if I had 500 full time employees, but now I have a thousand part time employees, that's twice as many jobs. Obama got credit for all those extra jobs, right? As we were, as we were destroying fulltime jobs and replacing them with two part time jobs.

Speaker 4:          01:20:02       We got all these jobs. So trump was honest as it candidate. These are low paying, these are crappy jobs, you know? And a lot of the people that were getting jobs were older people who don't want jobs. They were retired and now they're working at Mcdonald's part time because they can't live on their retirement money. And in fact, you know, when you look at the labor force participation rate that he would talk about, you know, we're labor force participation is collapsing is with young people. People in their twenties and thirties can't get jobs. Meanwhile 70 and 80 year olds are working in record percentages, right? Cause they can't afford to retire and their grandkids can't get a job. But so trump was telling the truth about how bad the economy really was. And that resonated. A lot of blue collar guys, a lot of Democrats in the Midwest voted for trump because he got it, he understood their p felt their pain, right?

Speaker 4:          01:20:52       Like Bill Clinton and Obama was in a fantasy of an, hillary was pretending that everything was great under Obama and people didn't want four more years of that. So they voted for trump. And also, you know, when trump was a candidate, he talked about the stock market because all of the stock market was going up when Obama was president. And trump said, well, it's a bubble. Who cares about the stock market? This is a big fat, ugly bubble. Wait til it pops. Okay. He was right about that. Now he's president. What is he saying? Every time I see him, this stock market's a new record high. This is fantastic. You know, it's all because of me. This is great. And when the jobs numbers come out, oh, this is, look how low the unemployment rate is. This is the lowest it's been in 15 years. I'm doing a great job.

Speaker 4:          01:21:32       I'm doing, nothing has changed. This is the exact same economy he inherited. It's the same crappy jobs. It's the same stock market bubble. The only difference is he's not a candidate anymore. He's the president and now he's trying to market the same crappy economy that Obama had and pretending everything is good. And I wish he was. Steve would stay true to the candidate and admit, you know what, the economy is still a disaster because nothing has changed, right? He was gonna drain the swamp. Instead he just poured more water in the same swap, let you know. But to actually drain it means to really shake things up. And in a way he's shaking things up, but not the way that's going to get meaningful change. For the country, right? The shaking up that he's doing is not what people were voting for, right? We really need real substantive economic change, but the president is not able to deliver it. And he's surrounded himself with the same cronies that, that were around in the Bush administration. I mean, what good is going back to Bush? What,

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       what does his incentive to do this in the first place? The guys already wealthy. I mean, and then he gets into this position and now he's a salesman. Right now he's trying to sell us on his ax and everything's great. And under him, everything's booming and it's going to keep booming. It's going to get better, and we're going to make America great again.

Speaker 4:          01:22:43       Yeah. You know, it was a good slogan. And you know why? I mean, trump's always been a salesman, right? He's a, he's a marketer. He's his, he makes money on his brands, right? So that's, that's in his blood. That's what he does. And he obviously does it, does it well, because he became very successful. Uh, you know, marketing is brand. And so I think he's Kinda continuing that. Um, but, you know, does he think about his legacy? I mean, does he want to actually a difference?

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       Does he, does he care about posterity and how he's viewed? You know, I don't know. I mean, if he, is he just trying to get reelected to so we can be the president again? I don't know. I'd have to, I've never had a conversation with him and I met him. I think I only remember meeting him one time. I was at a concert and we were sitting like on the same row. He was right next to me. It was a, uh, it was, uh, a crosby stills, Nash and young. And so I happen to, and he was there with his daughter and I think it was, I think it was, you know, her fiance, I don't think they were married yet, but they're married now so that they were there. I got to say hello. And I think that's the only time I ever met him.

Speaker 2:          01:23:39       And so it wasn't really, I didn't get a chance to engage him in any kind of thoughtful conversation. I know a lot of people who know him right. I mean, I know a lot of people who have been in his circle, but they've never kind of introduced me to it. So I'm kind of, you know, I'm not really on the inside, so I can't really, you know, don't really know. Um, but I mean, I voted for him, but that was why you vote for him. Because I didn't want to vote for Hillary now. I knew it didn't matter cause I lived in Connecticut. Oh. And by the way, now that I live in Puerto Rico, I can't vote anymore. But you know, it's like, that's one of the things people say that, oh, Puerto Rico's in trouble because you can't vote. Who Cares? Everyone I voted for in Connecticut lost in Congress.

Speaker 2:          01:24:15       Right. Cause you know, it doesn't matter. They don't have congressional representation because I'd rather have no taxes and no vote then to be able to vote for who taxes me. But, um, I voted for him. Um, I mean, I normally would just vote for Gary Johnson. Right. I had voted for Gary Johnson before because this is the second time you ran. I voted for him the last time. Um, but, um, but, you know, on the way to the polls, my wife was like, you know, we got to vote for trump because it was like, he was like the best protest vote I could cast. I thought, I thought he was a bigger in your face to the establishment then voting for Gary Johnson was, and I didn't, and they ran a bad campaign. They really blew an opportunity to have done something with the libertarian brand, uh, for future elections.

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       So I wasn't happy with the way that campaign ran. And they had, they had an opportunity there with how unpopular both candidates were. Uh, but I, you know, I just felt, you know, this is the wave. And, and I, I thought trump was going to win. You know, everybody thought that there's no way he's going to win. And you know, I thought, well, he might lose. I mean, I didn't think it was 100% guarantee, but I thought, I thought he was more likely to win than lose because I thought other people would think the same way. I knew the economy was a lot worse than was being portrayed by the media, by the Federal Reserve, by Obama. And I thought a lot of people would, you know, would vote that way. And I knew the polls, you know, maybe not be trusted because people didn't want to tell the pollsters that they were voting for trump because you know, oh, what are you a racist, you know, why you vote? But you know, when they get in there and vote, they're going to vote, you know, their pocket book and you know, trump was offering the most, the, the, the message that made sense. They knew America wasn't great. See, Hillary Clinton was like, we don't need to make America great again. It's already great. And the average guys, it doesn't feel so great to me. Right. My of living is going down. The only thing going up is my debt. And so they voted for trump. But I, I think this strategy is to blow up. I don't like

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       what trump is doing. What do you think his strategy is? Well, I think he is, he has now claimed ownership of this economy. He has put the trump brand on this stock market bubble. So when the market goes down, when the economy tanks back into recession, it's not Obama's recession, it's trump's. I mean, he's basically taken the bait. I think he's the fall guy. I think the Fed, everybody's going to blame it all on trump. Like, oh look, he inherited this great economy from Obama, which he didn't. And now look, it's a mess. So he should not be claiming credit, get for victories. He hasn't won. He should be setting us up for this collapse that is already coming. That is not because of him. He needs to clean up the mess. And it's not just Obama's mess, it's Bush's mess. Democrats and Republicans worked together to screw this economy up and the Federal Reserve was a big part of that.

Speaker 4:          01:26:52       And, and, and trump criticized the fed as a candidate. All of a sudden now, you know, he's just, he loves the fit. Wasn't there some sort of improvement in the stock market because people had confidence that he was going to enact these changes and he was, well, this is better for businesses. Yeah, I do think that that was able to add some air to the bubble, right? I think it was a big bubble. And then you know, when trump won, all of a sudden people start thinking, Hey, wait a minute, we're going to get tax cuts. We're going to get regulatory reform, we're going to get more economic growth. And so the market rallied on that. But I don't think that that's actually going to happen. I mean, look, they didn't repeal obamacare. That was a big part of the, the, the optimism. It doesn't look like we're going to get substantive tax reform the most.

Speaker 4:          01:27:35       We're going to get our tax cuts, so we're not going to get a real reform that's going to cause a lot more economic growth. We're just going to get bigger deficits. We're going to lower taxes, but we're not going to reduce government spending. And the real sad part is no one is talking about making government smaller. Everybody wants to talk about tax cuts. Okay, well taxes to support government. So if you want lower taxes, you need a smaller government. And I want both, right? I want lower taxes. But I'm not naive enough to think I can have big government with lower taxes because that just means bigger deficits and deficits are a worst way to pay for government and taxes. So if you decide that you want to have big government, then you better have high taxes to pay for it. And you know who's going to bear the brunt of that?

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       The middle class. So if the middleclass wants big government, they want lots of entitlements, then they're going to pay through the nose. But someone has to be honest and say, look, if you don't want high taxes, then we got to shrink government. But they're talking about making government bigger. Look, trump is talking about let's spend more money on infrastructure. Where's that money gonna come from? We're going to cut taxes and spend more money on infrastructure. You know, we're not going to make ourselves rich by spending money on infrastructure. Now, what happened with the Republicans that voted against obamacare and now vote against repealing Obama? Yeah, they're the same people. Like what? And what is wrong with trump's ideas? Well, for a stroke, those Republicans, again, are hypocrites. They only voted to repeal obamacare because they knew Obama would veto it, right? So it was easy to grandstand.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       Oh yes, let's repeal it. And it was a good talking point to get elected, but the minute they got elected, they were too afraid to actually stand on that principle because they didn't want to tell somebody that you can't buy insurance when you're sick for the same prices when you're healthy. Right. Nobody wanted to take away that free lunch that had been served up by, by, by the Democrats. All the Republicans wanted to do is rebrand the free lunch. They wanted to continue to serve it, but take credit for it. Right. They wanted to make it trump care or ryan care. Right. I didn't even like this whole idea. Let's repeal and replace repeal. Don't replace with anything. Replace it with the free market. We don't want to get rid of obamacare and replace it with something that's almost the same. It's what was the idea of replacing it in the first place?

Speaker 4:          01:29:45       Because they were, there is, it's all politics. The benefit was they tried to keep the ban on preexisting conditions, which voters liked, but get rid of the taxes and mandates, which they didn't. But the two are intertwined. You can't have one without the other. So that people liked the ban on preexisting conditions because they want to know that they're covered. If they've, if they're going in there and they have cancer, they could still get covered. Right? But then no one's going to buy coverage if they don't need it. I mean, you just cannot use what happens to those people that do have cancer and all these different diseases. If we don't have universal socialist healthcare, how do we do this to the thing that happens once they have the, a lot of them have to buy the insurance before they get the cancer, when they're still healthy.

Speaker 4:          01:30:21       Right? I mean, I don't have cancer right now. Right. I may get it next year in two or three years. So I have health insurance now. Right. Right. So if I get cancer, I know I'm covered that that's you. You're a successful guy. But what about someone who's not even in this bad position? Like you don't have to be that successful to be able to afford in a free market to buy herself some coverage. The question is what do you do with the person who made the mistake of not buying insurance when they were healthy and now they get sick? And of course, once you're sick, you can't expect an insurance company to sell you a policy because the insurance company is trying to make money. They only sell policies to people who they don't think we're going to put in claims. So you can't go to an insurance company when you're already sick and say, sell me a policy.

Speaker 4:          01:31:04       What's in it for the insurance company? Nothing. So now you've got to figure out, well, how do you take care of that person? Well, first of all, the best thing is to make sure that person buys the insurance policy while he's still healthy. So that means you, you have, you don't have the ban against preexisting conditions and you allow insurance companies to sell inexpensive insurance that doesn't cover a sex change operation or drug abuse. You know, Dario, he's Transphobic Cape. If you just want to buy insurance that covers like cancer, right? And you're 20 or 30 years old, that's cheap. It's very inexpensive. It's all this other crap that they want to mandate that makes it so expensive. But if you get a search of a situation where for whatever reason somebody had no insurance and they have no money and now they get cancer, well that's what charities are for.

Speaker 4:          01:31:46       People donate money. Hospitals, if doctors didn't have to spend so much time on paperwork and filling out insurance forms, they would have more time to donate. I mean, years and years ago, doctors used to give a lot of their spare time and of course that was before they had the income tax. You know, when the doctors didn't have to pay income taxes and when the doctors didn't have to deal with insurance companies, they had a lot of free time to help a lot of poor people for free. And doctors like doing that. Doctors get a lot of satisfaction from helping people. That's one of the reason that so many people become doctors. It's a very rewarding occupation when you're a doctor. Yes, it is lucrative and you can make money. But doctors also enjoy helping people for free. The problem is they can't even afford to do it now because there's all their time is spent doing other stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:32:29       They're also saddled down by malpractice insurance and they also have extreme amounts of medical school debt that they have to handle. Yet they shouldn't. It shouldn't be that expensive to go to medical school. And it wouldn't be if it was a free market. And yes, if we had tort reform, if you couldn't sue, look, it's funny, you know I'm staying here in a, at a friend of mine's house, he lives in Beverly Hills. We went to high school together, but, and so he's in real estate. He owns a lot of property and one of his tenants is starbucks, right? Starbucks restaurant. And they just got sued and the person is suing him as well because he's the landlord. So this is the circumstance and this is, this is America. So a guy, and he's, I guess he's hard of hearing. He's not totally deaf, but he has, he just has a hearing problem.

Speaker 4:          01:33:12       And so he goes into the starbucks and the starbucks is playing music right there, you know, whatever. They have background music on and the starbucks. And so he asked the guy behind the counter, oh, by the way, I'm hard of hearing. Do you have this special device that I can wear while I'm in here so that while I'm in this restaurant, I can enjoy the same music as everybody else. And the guy said, well, no, we don't have that device. Well, he sued for $10,000 plus attorney's fees. And now he's suing my friend too, because he's the landlord of were where the starbucks restaurant is. But this is America. I mean, you walk, that's a hilarious lawsuit. You walk into a restaurant and you have a hearing problem, get yourself a hearing aid. Don't force the guy. But these are the regulations. These are the lawsuits.

Speaker 4:          01:33:54       The, the Americans with disabilities act is the most ridiculous. I mean, know I remember what I, you know, in California, this is a true story. I'm not making this up. You can google this. There was a strip club here in southern California and I guess their, their, their thing was they had a shower on the stage and so the stripper would strip in the shower so you can watch her, you know, with the water. And it was, there was a big pole, right? So it was, the shower was up in the air and you had to climb up the pole to get to the shower and then you do your strippers, you'd strip, well, the government made them shut that down. And it was because it was discriminatory against strippers in wheelchairs because there was no way for a stripper in a wheelchair to climb up the pole. Now, I've never even seen a stripper in a wheelchair. Not that I'd spent a lot of time in strip clubs, but, but this is, this is where we are as a society, right. There were saying you, you know, if a stripper can't go on that pole, then nobody can go on that pole. Right. Or if a stripper that's in a wheelchair can't go on the, yes. Right. Yeah. Not, you know, but, but, but all these laws and regs, it's all this. Everybody is suing everybody because the government creates all these

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       phony rights. I mean, just because I'm hard of hearing doesn't mean the whole world has to accommodate the fact that I'm hard to hear it. I mean sometimes people will say, look, let's say I happen to have a size 14 shoe. I have, I have a really big foot. Does that mean that every shoe store has, has to stock a size 14 just, no. I mean cause they know that barely anybody is going to have a size 14 so they don't want, but I go to the big and tall store because I know they're going to have a size 14 so you know, they're going to be certain businesses that are going to cater to people with handicaps. Like you know, you have all these hotels and motels that have to shut down their swimming pools because they can't afford the money to have a lift so that somebody in a wheelchair can go into that swimming pool.

Speaker 2:          01:35:38       Well, why does every single swimming pool in the country have to accommodate somebody in a wheelchair? Why can't people who have wheelchairs go on the Internet and find out which hope, which hotels are catering to that particular clientele and just go there. But when you force everybody to do it, they were doing miniature golf courses are shutting down because they can't figure out how to be accessible to people in wheelchairs, even if no one in the wheelchair has ever tried to play that course. And then they end up having to shut it down because they can't, you know, uh, you know, the whole, the whole thing. I used to go in, I used to go to this beach here in, uh, in, in, in Malibu and I was younger living here. And in order to get to the beach, you know, you had to walk down like a cliff.

Speaker 2:          01:36:17       It was like a dog beach, and I forget the name of it, but there was no stairs. You had to kind of walk down this cliff. But you know, in the very front there were like three or four handicap parking spaces that were never filled. They were always empty and a lot of people would have to park on pch cause the parking lot would get phil. But nobody would ever use the handicap spots because nobody who was handicapped could possibly get down to that beach yet they had to have those spots there anyway. It had to have those spots, but they didn't have to have some sort of a real access to cause. It's cause that's nature. Right? So it was a beach that no one, no one who is handicapped could ever go to. But yet they had to have all these, all these spots there.

Speaker 2:          01:36:50       Like you could take that to Yosemite and say like, Hey, if you want to climb this mountain, you have to have use of your arms. So we're going to have to figure out some sort of a handicapped access up to the top of this mountain and is otherwise it's unfair. But this is where all the government, the government thinks they're being charitable. It look, do I feel bad that people have handicaps, are poor of course, but that the solution is not the Americans disabilities act. And you know, there are a lot of employers now that won't hire people with handicaps because it's now so expensive. Whereas they would have done it before. You know, that's the whole thing about, you know, these antidiscrimination laws. Like, you know, you can't discriminate based on gender, based on sex, based on, uh, you know, uh, you know, uh, sexual identity and all these different things. Well, because of that, there's actually more discrimination. You know, there are actually employers now who aren't racist at all, but who will go out of their way not to hire minorities because they're afraid of getting sued, right? Oh, if I hire a, a black eye or if I hire a Hispanic or if I hire a homosexual, what if I fire that person because they're not doing a good job? They could sue me. They could say, well, you fired me because I'm gay. Doesn't mean about women in tech. I heard this argument

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       recently because I was reading some article written by Ellen Pao. She was that woman who, uh, had that big lawsuit, sexual discrimination lawsuit. She said some article about women in tech and someone was saying, well, see this, this is the reason why people don't want to hire women in the first place. But it isn't that sort of a slippery slope because if she really was being sexually discriminated against, well, they shouldn't really be able to do that in the first place. If he's saying is true that they create this hostile work environment for women, they shouldn't be able to necessarily just never hire women, just so they can remind here. Hostile. Right. Does that make sense?

Speaker 4:          01:38:32       Remember if you have a business, right, right. Because they always sue the business. They don't. So let's say one of my male employees harass us, one of my female employee, they don't say that one guy, the owner. Right? So this is how it works against him. So more profitable because the owner has all the money, right? Right. You know, so, so here's what happened. So I am an owner of a business and now some woman walks in and let's say she is particularly attractive. And I start thinking, okay, do I really want to have this potential lawsuit walking around my office? Do I really want, because maybe she really does get harassed, but I'm the one that's liable for that harassment. Right? And I can have all the policies I want, but you know, guys are horny. I mean, we know what we're like and you know, you, you dangled lump me in there, sir. All right. Well dairy, but I mean 10 pete employers don't want lawsuits. Right? And, and so the easier you make it to sue, the less likely you're going to get a job. So if employers are looking at, I want to hire the person who's least likely to sue me,

Speaker 3:          01:39:32       but isn't it conversely, the harder you make it to sue, the more likely people are going to get harassed?

Speaker 4:          01:39:37       No. I mean, if, if somebody has harassed and sue the person that harassed you, don't sue the person who happened to employ him. That might've had nothing to do with it. Right? So don't sue you,

Speaker 3:          01:39:47       the individual that causes whatever the issue is.

Speaker 4:          01:39:50       Yeah. I mean, it's gotta be a pro. It can't, you can't just say the employer and, but again, when you talk about something like discrimination, like see I'm Jewish, right? So maybe it's easier if I just talk about Jews versus something else. But, so let's say somebody doesn't want to hire me because I'm Jewish. I support their decision. They have a right not to like me and no one, no one has to like Jews. And I know not everybody does. And if somebody is an anti-semite, that's their right to be that, you know, if they want to fire me because I'm Jewish, they can do that. They don't want to hire me. You know, if somebody wants to have a restaurant and they want to put a sign that says no juice, that's there right now. I think anybody that eats there, I, you know, I think they got a problem because look, look, I'm not black.

Speaker 4:          01:40:32       If there was a restaurant that had a sign that said no blacks, there's no way I would eat there. Just out of principle of effects. I think if there's somebody that doesn't like Jews, the last thing they're going to do is put that sign out there because you know what? They want me to eat there. Even though they don't like me. They want my money. And they also don't want the blow back and they don't want the bad public. Can you imagine like people keep people say like, well, you know, if, if we don't have all these antidiscrimination laws, then restaurants aren't going to serve blacks. You name me one. Rhett, you find one restaurant in this country with the Internet that put out a sign. No blacks allowed. I mean, that'd be the end of that restaurant. Well, a lot of these laws were sort of established before the Internet was the powerful force centers today.

Speaker 4:          01:41:10       Right, right. But we can now see all a lot of the harm that these, these laws have done. Because you go back, you go back before all these antidiscrimination laws up, black teenage unemployment, let's say in the 30s was lower than white teenage unemployment lower. Now, do you think we have, we're more racist today than we were back then. No, we're not more racist or less racist, but it's all these laws that have backfired. All these, you know, uh, you know, antidiscrimination laws and you know, you have this whole industry like recently, right? You know, you have this big movement because we had the riots in Charlottesville because you know, they want to take down these statues, these confederate statues as if those confederate statues are the reason that we have poverty and unemployment and crime in African American communities. These statues have nothing to do with that and taking them down.

Speaker 4:          01:41:56       Is it going to change anything? But you've got these people in America that make a living off of poverty and off of race baiting that want to say, oh, the reason that you're poor, the reason that there's crime is because of racism and the racism is because of these statutes. So vote for me, give me money and I will help you write. You're a victim and I am your solution. And, and they, they act well, we'll just get rid of the statute because even if they get rid of the statues, nothing's going to change. Now they have to get rid of something else.

Speaker 3:          01:42:22       I think that the statute to her for a lot of people represents racism. Like if you see a Robert E. Lee statue and then you read about what Robert E. Lee did to his own personal slaves and oversaw some of the lashings and you know, in caught slaves that were trying to escape as a horrible account. I retweeted recently of some slave that was, uh, caught while I was trying to escape. Robert E. Lee, Robert E. Lee oversaw that beating him and lashing him.

Speaker 4:          01:42:48       Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean all of the various stories of, I know that Robert E. Lee was a very well respected guy, even in the north. I mean he was very, in fact, Lincoln wanted him to run the union army. I mean he turned it down because he couldn't because he was a good killer. No, well respected. Well, it was a good general, he was a war hero in these American Mexicans. Also a slave owner. Well, so a lot of people, so it was Thomas Jefferson, so it was George Washington. I mean, a lot of people go for Neri though, right? Of course. Look, if Thomas Jefferson were alive today, he would not own slaves, obviously. Right? But if you or I were born in the Annabella south, if I was born in Virginia in 1750 would I feel differently about slavery that I do today? There's a good chance that I would, I mean it was the culture slavery had been going on for thousands of years. It's not like we invented it, so it was horrific.

Speaker 3:          01:43:36       Good is that is to say, I think you're being very honest. I think you're being very pragmatic about the,

Speaker 4:          01:43:41       my point is that most people that even see a statue of Robert E. Lee don't even know who Robert E. Lee was. The average American doesn't even know who fought in the civil war, let alone who want it. I mean, thanks to American

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       schools, I don't think those statues, those statues have been there for looked. Martin Luther King never cared about those statues. He didn't march down and said, we've got to get rid of the statutes. Do you know in a lot of those statues are actually put up. They have, a lot of them were put up during the civil rights era. They were put up because people were fighting against all the racists and so pete, it was a reaction. Walls were put up. They, they, a lot of them were put up in a 90019101920 I mean the southsea spike, there's actually a spike in these civil war monuments going up and they're actually fairly cheap, cheaply made, you know, bronze statues that were cheaper to produce that were made during the civil rights era and direct protest to the civil rights era. Yeah. They made up these statues of guys that grows when they forget to represented slavery.

Speaker 2:          01:44:39       The people who were leading the anti civil rights movement were all the Democrats. Right. Even though lb a long time ago. Right, right. Well, this is dirt. This is when they passed it. When they, when they pass the civil rights act, 1964 it was only because of Republicans that had passed. If the Republicans had voted for it in the same proportion and Democrats, it would have been defeated. But that the part of the Civil Rights Act that I was against, right. And I obviously I was a little kid then, so I was, I was, I was born in 1963 so I'm just looking back at it, right? That all of the, the antidiscrimination laws that had to do with government and the state governments, because you had a lot of institutionalized racism down South by Democrats, right. And all that was bad. And the fact that we eradicated was good.

Speaker 2:          01:45:19       The part that was bad is the part that went into the private realm and said, if you are a private person, you can't discriminate because now all of a sudden the government is the thought police. Now all of a sudden, you know, every, every decision that everybody makes is being second guessed. You've opened up everybody to all sorts of lawsuits and you've gotten blow back where, you know, businesses are afraid to hire people not because they're racist or bigot, but because they don't, they fear a lawsuit. And so now you've increased the cost of employing, uh, people that are in these, in these specialized groups. So I think that that was a bad thing. And also I think legally, I don't think the government constitutionally has the right to tell me. I mean, everybody knows, like if somebody tried to tell me as a, in my private life, you know, you need, you know, you need to be an equal opportunity dater, right?

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       All the women that you, you, you, you know, you can't just date white women or seeing this argument. I mean, and, and also, you know, even as an employee, right? If I, let's say I'm Jewish, if I say, Hey, I want to work for another Jew. I just like working for Jews and I go and I apply for jobs and, and I, and I see, you know, I don't want to work for you. You're not Jewish. Oh, you know, so I can discriminate as a worker among, and I can quit. I can go to my employer and say, you know what? I'm tired of working for a Jew. I quit. Right? That's legal. You can't sue me for discriminating against you and going to work for my competitor. So look employers or are you don't lose your rights because you create a business. You don't lose your rights. I'm sorry, let me interrupt you here,

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       but don't you think there's a big difference between someone who makes a personal decision of where they want to work versus someone who has power over you? There's a big difference that she'd someone who chooses like I don't like working for this guy because a, I only like working for white people and you can decide to do that because it's your own personal choice to where to go that you're not, you're not holding any power over someone. These laws are created. They're antidiscrimination laws because you're discriminating against other people and you can keep other people from making a living.

Speaker 4:          01:47:16       Well, employment is all about discrimination, right? I'm trying to find the best person for the job. I can discriminate based on all sorts of factors,

Speaker 3:          01:47:23       right? That's a one way to look at it. Right? Discrimination, but you're being discerning more than a,

Speaker 4:          01:47:28       right. What you're saying, look, you're going to discriminate based on competence based on their background. Basically discrimination, discrimination of the word though it's still discriminating just means you're, you know, you're kind of picky, right, right, right. You're talking about discriminating based on a factor. Like you're being racist or sexist or homophobic being, being discriminating and racism are, are different things. Right? Cause you, you can discriminate based on race and not be a racist. Like let's say somebody decides, okay, I, I can, I can hire two candidates. One is white and one is black. And if they say, well, if I hire the white candidate, uh, I'm less likely to get sued if I have to terminate him because he's not doing a good job because he can't, he can't claim. So if I make that decision based on race, it's not because I'm a racist.

Speaker 4:          01:48:17       I'm trying to practically look at the numbers. I'm not necessarily would disagree. They would say that is a racist decision. Like you're assuming that black people would be more likely to sue you? Well they have that statistically, no, because you can't, you can't. If I fire somebody who's white, they can't say you fired me because I'm white. It's just never at, you can't do that. So obviously there are plenty of lawsuits for wrongful termination. I've had them myself where somebody says, you sued me because I'm black. Nobody is going to say you fuck you fire me. So it is, it is a, a statistic, a statistic that somebody can consider, but it doesn't mean that they're an actual

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       fantastic or more black people or black people or rather more likely to fire for sue for wrongful termination.

Speaker 4:          01:49:01       Black person is more likely to sue for a racially based determination. Then somebody who's white, you know, a women as a woman is more likely to sue because she was discriminated based on her sex. A man is not likely to say, you fired me because I'm a man, but you're going to get someone saying you fired me because I'm a woman because they're a member of the, you know, of a protected class. But if somebody makes a decision, that doesn't mean that you're, that you're, you know, anti women. If you're trying to make a rational decision, the racism is just believing that one race is inferior. Just not liking somebody because cost our member of particular, that's totally different.

Speaker 3:          01:49:37       Racial discrimination should be legal. If you're thinking about the future of your business and just hedging,

Speaker 4:          01:49:42       well, you know what? No, I don't care. I think it should be legal no matter what. I don't want to, Elac I think have a right

Speaker 2:          01:49:49       to be assholes. Yes. And, but the thing is though, if you're a businessman and you're, and you're making your hiring decisions based on the color of people's skin or their gender, and my competitors are making decisions based on competence, you're not going to survive. I mean, if you are going to turn down a better quality female worker and you're going to settle for somebody who can't do the job as well, because you want to hire a man that you know, you're not going to be a successful businessman. So I have my faith in the free market. That racism, there is a cost, right? When when you're a racist and you want to be a racist and business that costs you a lot of money. And I think, you know, but what happens is, you know, the government tries to take the cost away from racism.

Speaker 2:          01:50:30       You know, they, they, they, they tried it. They tried to substitute laws and regulations. I, I'd rather have the market punish the racist. Right. Let the market punish somebody who is hiring people that are not competent for the job, but he's hiring them for some ridiculous reason. Well, conversely, what did you think about the Google memo? Because one of the, one of the things about that memo was the, the gentleman that was fired, what does his name, James Damore. Yeah, that's his name. He was saying that Google was hiring people based on whether or not they are minorities and women regardless of their competence. Yeah. I mean we're discriminating on like discriminating against straight white males to pursue people that would give them the appearance of diversity. Well, they're doing that. Well, they're, I mean, they're trying to be more diverse and, and mainly the diversity that they're going for is they mop, they want to hire more women and also more minority.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       So that, that too, but I think his argument or his paper was more focused on the gender, but what he was trying to do is point out that fact that fewer women are just in programming. I mean, they're not, they're not interested in that pursuit as much as men are. And so, you know, when, when you're, when you're hiring, right? When Google is hiring and they're trying to get the very best, you know, there's a much bigger pool of male applicants for those jobs. I mean, it's much more competitive. And so he's making the point that, look, you're just not going to get a lot of women in these jobs. And if you're going to just try to have more diversity, you're just going to sacrifice the quality. And you know, I'm sure that he's right. But the interesting thing is he gets fired for expressing that opinion.

Speaker 2:          01:52:01       And what's ironic is he suing? Well now look, I mean look personally see personally I think that Google should be able to, it's their company. I think that if they want to fire somebody, they should be able to do that. Now if he had a contract, so I don't know what kind of employment contract, if he's an at will employee, you know, I think they should be able to terminate them for whatever reason. Just like I think he should be able to quit. Well they were saying he was reinforcing negative gender stereotypes. That was the main reason they publicly stated that he was being fired. I think it, look, it shows you how you know how low that we fallen as a society that you know you're allowed to express your opinion as long as it's the politically correct opinion and Google is afraid of the blow back. And I could still look if they think it's going to hurt their profits if they think the way to make in America today

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       is to bow down on the altar of political correctness and just pretend that things that you know are true or not true. Uh, but you know, my principals are consistent, but I do think that they violate, they probably violated California labor law in the way they fired him. Uh, I don't like California labor law. I mean, I'm an employer here in California and I don't like it. And I would probably employ a lot more people here if they didn't have the labor law that they do. Uh, but I'm consistent in my view. So, but I, it, I think it's terrible that they had to fire him because if he had expressed the exact opposite position, it wouldn't have been a problem. Right. It's just because he is basically saying the truth. I mean, look, why is it that you have to pretend that men and women are exactly the same in all aspects of life?

Speaker 4:          01:53:32       That there's no difference in our evolutionary biology that men and women didn't necessarily evolve in different ways based on the roles that they played, you know, thousands of years ago or tens of thousands of years ago. And that there's, you know, there's something about maleness and again it's not like obviously there are exceptions to the rule, right? But in general the average man is going to be, you know, there's going to be certain way, think ways that the average man is going to be different than the average women. And if, and maybe men just for whatever reason go are going into program in computer science, in greater numbers and women. I mean that's just going to happen. That's just nature. You can't try to pretend that doesn't exist or a bad thing.

Speaker 3:          01:54:12       Mary Psychology, I mean this is, this is something that's been studied because looking at human beings and the choices they make based on their gender, based on their environment, based on there's a host of different factors to deny that it does seem. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:54:26       And, and again, no one's talking about, obviously there are going to be examples that don't fit that, that of course, but there's always outliers. But when we're looking at numbers in a, in a job, you're looking at the totality, the, you know, and so if there's only 10%, uh, women to say, well we need to make it 50, 50 because half the world is women is the,

Speaker 3:          01:54:49       that's like if the UFC said, listen, we need more women fighters so we're going to fire some of the men that are way better fighters and we're going to hire more women fighters to make a more diverse lineup even though there's way less women interested in fighting.

Speaker 4:          01:55:02       I'm sure. I'm sure that, cause obviously, I mean I, I'm, I'm amazed that they're even any women really don't want to be fighters. But I mean obviously there's going to be some, but the vast majority of women that I know, they might like watching other men fight, but the last thing they want to do is step in the ring because that's mostly a masculine thing, that type of violence. You know, most women that that doesn't mean there's no women that want to do that. Of course there's going to be women.

Speaker 3:          01:55:25       It's a good example cause they're outliers and when you're just looking at it without any discrimination, you just looking at the, this pursuit and trying to figure out which genders are more likely to enter this pursuit, whether it's being a lumberjack or a minor or whatever. I, you could say all the factors you want to look. Well, maybe they're worried about discrimination of other men on the job.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Maybe they're worried about being sexually harassed me with a word about this. Whatever those factors are, there's a lot more women that are interested in other pursuits, course nursing. But then, and then when the government comes in and just says, oh, well the numbers are this and now we have to fix this because this must be the result of discrimination. Yeah. When it's not, it's just the natural result of people acting freely, but it's also good people's response to that. They almost can't have a measured objective response. Like the woman who's the CEO of Youtube said that she was very hurt by that memo and that this guy was a massage. It's the credit memo. Meanwhile, she's the fucking CEO of Youtube. Like she is like an example of a woman that can succeed. It does succeed because she does have the personnel. And also, you know, I don't like this idea when you say, oh I'm, I was offended.

Speaker 2:          01:56:33       Right. It's like, hey, you know, you don't have a right not to be offended. I mean, look, you know, you have to be a little sensitive. You have to have a thicker skin. You know, people are gonna say things that you offend that, that are offensive to you. That doesn't mean they don't have a right to speak their mind. You know, people, I mean that's, you know, you a lot of people now all of a sudden freedom of speech just taken a back door to my, my sensibilities. I don't, I don't want to be, I don't want to be offended because she play out. It's a cheap way out to just say I'm offended. And then people have to sort of act, we ask and they have to figure out some sort of a way to, to, you know, calm down your, your, uh, offended personality or your, your whatever it is about what you've done.

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       Yeah. And you know, no one, as I said earlier, I mean, you don't have a right not to be offended, you know, and there's gonna be a lot of defensive people in the world and, and, and the, and the reason that you defend, uh, people that are being offensive is not because you're defending what they're saying. You're defending your right to be offensive to other people. Because look, there are a lot of people that said, we talked about the socialists. There can be a lot of socialists that are offended by the fact that I believe in the free market or people can be offended that I think people should have a right to be able to discriminate. Right. So, but so now if, if I'm not going to protect somebody else's right to free speech, then they could take away mine. Cause I don't want the government determining, you know, what's offensive and what's not.

Speaker 2:          01:57:50       I don't want the government saying this speech is protected in this speech, isn't it? Because the minute you go down that slippery slope, you know, the next thing you know, you know, all the libertarians are now fascist and none of us can speak. Right. And the, you, the government gets more and more power and they try to shut people up that want to criticize it. That's truly shrinking government and truly letting the marketplace of ideas decide what people do and don't do and which way they gravitate. Yeah. And as I said, I think the free market and competition will punish racist. I think their businesses will fail. I don't think they're going to succeed as well as people who are broader minded, who are looking beyond sex and looking beyond, uh, you know, race and just hiring, uh, based on ability and based on, you know, all those other characteristics that are, that are relevant to the job performance. And to the extent that there's going to be a disparity, if there's going to be certain

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       occupations that are mostly men at the certain occupations that are women, it's not because of discrimination. And in fact if you look at this nonsense about, you know, women are paid like seventies whatever's sense for every man, which obviously that's not true because that was true. I would only hire women and pay him 77 cents on the dollar. I mean, if you could actually hire women cheaper than men, I mean I'm out. Why would, why would I even know? Why would I ever hire a man? I would only hire women.

Speaker 3:          01:59:07       I've had this conversation many times with people that really believe that it really believe in the gender pay gap. There is no gender pay gap. I mean if you, isn't that an amazing statistic that the, even the president, like when Obama was president, he was saying that in a speech knowing it was disingenuous. Yeah, no appeals

Speaker 4:          01:59:25       to women to get their votes. But you know, if, if you, if you, if you basically a correct for all the jobs classes, right? So if you take a woman who's let's say 40 years old, never been married, man, 40 years old, never married, basically the same educational background and you study, you'll find that they pretty much make the same. Right? It's that when you look at the choices that the typical woman makes during her career and you know, even if it's the same occupation, let's say they're both lawyers and they both went to the same law school, even if they both get married, the chances are the woman, you know, took a back, took her law career and it became secondary to her children. She's, she, she worked fewer hours. She didn't travel as much. She got herself off that track and went on more of a mommy track because not, no.

Speaker 4:          02:00:17       Do all women do that? No. But more women are likely and, and, and they prefer that, right? They prefer so they don't, they don't work as much. They don't volunteer to travel as much. And it's because of the choices that they make along the way that they end up earning less money than their male counterpart. Not because somebody has just discriminating against them. Because there is a competitive market. I mean, if you are a woman that is working just as hard as a man and you're sacrificing everything for your career and you know you're going to, you're going to earn the same as the guy make us. It's a competitive market, especially for those higher skills. I mean, you just can't underpay people in the marketplace because somebody else will outbid you. But it's such a convenient talking point. It is. It's the lie of it's, it's the left.

Speaker 4:          02:01:01       It's how you get votes. Like, Hey, you're getting paid less because you're being victimized. You're being discriminated against. So vote for me and I'll fix that. I will force your employer to pay you money. And that's, you know, obviously, you know, there's that Willie Sutton was one of his famous quotes was, you know, why do you rob banks? Well, because that's where the money is, right? So the votes are with employees much more people have jobs then create jobs, right? So if you're trying to get the votes votes of the employee, that's better than getting votes of employers. So a lot of people get votes by promising to force their boss to give them something. You're going to get more vacations, you're going to get a more sick days, you're going to get and a half he's, he's going to have to do this. Well, all that, the employer doesn't give you anything.

Speaker 4:          02:01:44       So if he's going to give you more vacation is because he's going to pay you less than wages. I mean, it's all a trade off. I mean, when the government mandates certain benefits, all they're doing is taking your choice away to negotiate how you want to be compensated. Because ultimately the employer is not going to pay you more than you're worth. And if you say, well, you got to give this person, you know, these vacations, or you got, okay, well I gotta pay him less money so I can give them the vacations. It's all one big compensation package.

Speaker 3:          02:02:08       Well, it seems like it's a political thing. Again, it's a thing that people do in order to get you to lean towards them more and to have you feel that, uh, to have people feel that this person is looking out for my needs. This person is looking out from my point of view, my perspective, and he understands the plight that women go through. Whereas Peter Schiff, he's so hardcore, but you know, it is capitalistic that he doesn't even care about what women go through or discrimination or,

Speaker 4:          02:02:33       yeah. And it's like the reality is if I didn't care about women, I wouldn't care about these laws. I understand how these laws backfire and hurt women. I understand how, you know, all these laws that are meant to do good actually do harm. And that's one of the reasons that when you find a lot of liberals, they actually think conservatives or libertarians are bad people, right? Because they said, hey, you're against this law. You must be a bad person because this law is going to help people in their mind you are. Because otherwise I would support the law. Right? See, when I think about most liberals, I don't think they're bad. I just think they're misunderstood. They're, they're misinformed. They're ignorant. They don't understand. I just, they're good people, but they're going about it in a bad way. They don't understand that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Speaker 4:          02:03:14       I don't want to go to hell. I don't care how many good intentions you have. If I know that that road is going to hell, I'm going to try my best, you know, to, to build a different road. Right. And I, I believe that free market capitalism is the best way to raise the standard of living of everybody. Whether you're a woman, whether you're black, whether you're homosexual, it's the individual acting freely. That's going to be your best hope. If you're going to empower government, and this is one of the things that you don't never, I can never figure out because people are, again, they're very suspicious of, of, of businesses and businessmen, yet they can have complete trust in politicians. You get politicians all this power and then you trust them to use it. But evidently, I mean, why aren't they just as corrupt? Just because somebody uses politics to get rich doesn't mean they're on some moral high ground.

Speaker 3:          02:04:00       Well, even worse. This idea that if you give it more of your taxes that the government is somehow another going to going to be competent with how they distribute those taxes and that there's some going to be egalitarian. The they're gonna use the taxes for good like that. It's a very disgusting sort of an idea and the idea that any sense at all

Speaker 4:          02:04:18       or the idea that government is going to make better decisions for you or your family, then you are right. I mean the government doesn't even know you. They don't know your kids yet. You're going to, they're going to decide, you know what they eat or where they go to school or you know know that the people that care about your kids or you, right, you care. I mean look at these lousy schools that unfortunately why so many people vote for Bernie Sanders is because they went to these government schools and they got a lousy education. Their teachers a socialist. It's all the whole socialists, the system. But the parents are trapped because their taxes are already paying for these lousy schools. They're monopolies, you know? And so, but if the Liberals Act as if, well, if we didn't have government schools, then parents wouldn't educate their kids. Of course they would.

Speaker 4:          02:05:00       You don't think they would send their kids to private schools and they'd be a lot less expensive. And you'd have all kinds of entrepreneurs who are trying to earn money, educating poor kids, just like people earn a lot of money, clothing, poor kids and feeding poor kids and, and housing them. I mean if there's money to be made and entrepreneur is going to come in and satisfy that desire, but you against public education or do you just think that, what do you think? It shouldn't be subsidized the way it is, like especially colleges. Well, I think that government education is much too expensive and not good enough. I mean, people think that, oh, we need the government to educate. And I think, you know, education is very important and I, I don't think it's so important. We just shouldn't leave it up to government. I think that the free market, the free market does a better job of creating computers, right?

Speaker 4:          02:05:44       I think it will do a better job of creating education and people are struggling. They really liked the idea that at least education is free for the children. It's not free. Every nothing that the government provides is free. It costs money, right? Where's that money coming from? The government has to take money and the stuff that you get for free from the government is very expensive. The stuff that you get from the free market that you pay for is much less expensive and it's a much higher quality. Now, you know the problem with colleges, right? We have a lot of colleges that are not run necessarily by government, but why are they so expensive? Because the government subsidizes university tuition by either guaranteeing loans or directly providing loans to students, and this drives up the price of college. The reason that college is so expensive is because of government subsidizing the cost.

Speaker 4:          02:06:30       So there is no free market to control the cost. You just have the government to subsidize the ever escalating costs and providing all this money. So now you know, people go to college and they graduate with a mortgage without a house. That's, that's the government that's did that. But you have these liberals, they think the government is helping them. Like the, the liberal, we'll say, vote for me and I'll, I'll make sure you get a loan so you can go to college. Well, the only reason they need a loan is because the college is so expensive. And why is it college so expensive? Because of the loans. You know what I mean? My father went to college and his parents didn't have any money because they were poor and middle, lower middle class. Uh, but so he worked his way through college by having a summer job.

Speaker 4:          02:07:11       And that summer job was enough to pay for everything. Room, board, tuition, and all of his friends work their way through college. Why can't Americans work their way through college today? Because the government made college so expensive because of all this, all the loans. But what happened is the government said, hey, you don't have to have a job while you're in college. We'll just, we'll just guarantee alone, you know, and you'll just be able to borrow the money. But you know, graduated with a bunch of debt, doesn't do the kids any favors. They would've been better off, you know, you know, pain having a summer job instead of like, you know, just partying all summer or taking spamming their summers around Europe while they're borrowing money.

Speaker 3:          02:07:45       Well, it's two giant issues with that one. One giant issue with the debt is you're getting out of college and you're going to take a job that's probably not going to pay you a whole lot in the first place and you're saddled down with who knows how many thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt. And then on top of that, you can't even go bankrupt and dissolve that debt. It's the well, his country that you're stuck with forever.

Speaker 4:          02:08:07       Terrible kids take on this debt when they're 17 1819 making good decisions. So they're terrible decisions. They're horrible decision. You look, you know, they, they don't understand. They don't know anything about money. There are two consequences. Yeah. And they've been fed a lie that will, you know, if you don't go to college, your life is ruined. You'll never, you know, I knew I, you know, do some of my videos on my channel, my youtube channel and, and one of the videos that I did and I wish it got more views and maybe it will be, I could talk about on your show, what does the Youtube Channel Tell people? Peter Schiff. Peter. Yeah. My name is uh, you know the shift report, but one of the videos I did and I called, it's a, is a college degree worth the cost you decide. And I did this like four years ago down in New Orleans.

Speaker 4:          02:08:47       And um, I went down the street and I was asking people who were working, I didn't talk to people who are just there to have drinks. I worked at the people who were working on Bourbon Street, right. They were strippers, they were bouncers, they were petty cab drivers, they were bartenders. They were taken out the trash cans and I didn't discriminate. I asked everybody I saw and almost everybody I talked to is on this video. I mean, very few people didn't make it. And I basically said, did you go to college? When did you graduate? Right? Uh, what was your major and how much do you owe? Right? And every single person that I talked to that was doing a menial job, and some of, some of them had two or three degrees, master's degrees. And this is all and, and, and the point was, and some people thought I was trying to make fun of the people and I wasn't trying to make fun of anybody.

Speaker 4:          02:09:34       I was trying to prove a point that this was a complete waste of time and money. That these individuals could have done these jobs without college. They could have done it right out of high school without all this debt. And that just having these degrees didn't mean anything. Who benefited from these degrees? The universities that sold these overpriced degrees, they benefited the, you know, that that's who benefits from all these college loans. Not these kids who borrow $50,000 and now hour emptying trash cans because they got some liberal arts degree that's meaningless. It's the universities, the college that got the over got to overcharge for degree that the kid would have been better off without. And then there's also the opportunity cost. You know, you spend five or six years now and these overcrowded colleges, you know, you should be four years, but now it's so hard to get the classes that sometimes it takes you five or six years to even graduate and you graduate with nothing.

Speaker 4:          02:10:22       You've got a worthless degree. You've got politicians that are saying everybody needs to have a college degree. Okay, well if everybody has one, what's it worth? Nothing. You know, at one point, maybe one in 10 people had a college degree because, and then it actually meant something because you had something that not everybody else has. But you know, if everybody has a degree, then you've actually destroyed the value of the degree. And that's what the government has done. They've made a degree, extremely expensive to get, but there's very little value. And you have all these politicians are not qualities. Maybe colleges, they'll try to say, look at how much more money people make who have college degrees versus people who don't have college degrees. And they assume that the reason for that is the college degree. Again, it's false statistics, right? Because think about the typical person who chooses to go to college.

Speaker 4:          02:11:05       They're smarter, they're more ambitious, they're harder working. That's why they're making more money, not because they have a degree, right? So if you probably looked at two individuals from the same circumstances, maybe same high school, same demographic, they got the same GPA, they got the same, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, sat scores. One went to college and one didn't, and then you followed them. You might find that the guy that had the gumption to skip college is actually making more money than the guy who went to college. Maybe he started a business, maybe he, he gained some real world experience and then he wasn't encumbered by a bunch of debt. Right? So it's not the college degree at this point. No. Yet. If you want to be a doctor, sure you got to go to college or you got to go to med school, but there are a lot of things that you don't need a college degree to do and a lot of people who were doing them have college degrees and their success is not a function of that college degree.

Speaker 4:          02:11:58       It's a, it's a function of the hard work that they did after they left. College. Education is very important, but you can get a tremendous amount of education today and this is not, you know, the 18 hundreds you can get it online. Oh you can get it through books. You can get it through audio course. I mean I'm not, sometimes I'm not anti-education. I think people should educate themselves and you're anti the college debt people are, well, I'm anti the government saying the only way to get educated is to have a school do it. I mean, you know there are a lot of Americans we talked about, you know Robert E. Lee, but you'd go to the founding fathers. A lot of these guys were all self educated men. They didn't necessarily go to college. Some of them did, but a lot of them were self educated.

Speaker 4:          02:12:34       And believe me back then, educating yourself was pretty hard. I mean the only books you had were the ones that you could check out of a library. I mean, now anybody, any kid in a poor inner city has everything at his fingertips. You could go on the Internet and you can teach yourself and in fact professors can sell courses online. You don't have to, you know, go to a college. I uh, uh, some professor can have a tutorial site and he could charge like, you know, 10 bucks a month and he could give lectures and he can teach, you can learn all sorts of stuff without enriching some government bureaucracy, some college or university. And you don't have to borrow tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to learn what you can learn for practically nothing on the Internet. Yeah. Speaking to the, I know we spent a lot of time here, but I can't let you leave unless I ask you this one last thing.

Speaker 4:          02:13:23       What are your thoughts on cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin and all these different, yeah, and I know, let's talk about that and let's, you know, hopefully we have enough time to really hash this, this subject. How, cause I know, you know, I was on your show a few years ago and we talked about cryptocurrencies and you know, I was very skeptical about them then and I'm as skeptical about them now, but of course, obviously had you just bought them when I was here a few years ago. Skyrocket, right? I mean, obviously if you bought them back then you could turn around and you can sell them today for a lot more money, right? So, but does that mean they're going to work? Does that mean they're going to fulfill the promise that everybody believes? Right? And what is it that people believe about bitcoin and you know, they believe that it's going to be money, right?

Speaker 4:          02:14:06       That is going to either replace or exist alongside of the dollar, the euro, the yen, right? That it's, people are going to use it as a medium of exchange that is going to be a store of value. And they're, it's just not going to work. It is not going to happen. I know there are a lot of people that believe this and they almost believe it, like a cult, right? They believe it like a religion. And the fact that I don't believe it, I'm just, you know, I, I'm, I'm either a fool, I just, I'm stuck in my ways. I just don't get it, you know, and, you know, look, you know, I've seen it all before when it came to the dotcoms when it came to the real estate and it's not that, like I did a podcast again on my own and I was trying to compare, uh, I was, I was looking at, uh, uh, the Internet stocks and I was talking, I use pets.com as an example.

Speaker 4:          02:14:53       And I, you know, looked at bitcoin and then somebody did a video critical of me trying to explain that, why bitcoin is not like pets.com. And I never tried to equate the two. What I was talking about was the idea when pets.com was started and people were making money because the stock went up, right? They thought that the business would succeed as a business, that it would make a profit right now, it never did. It went bankrupt, but people bought it early on and it went up. Now the fact that it went up didn't mean that they were right in their ultimate bet. It just meant that other people made the same mistake and paid an even higher price. And so you can be wrong, but still profit from being wrong as long as there are other fools who are also wrong. And that's where I see the similarity in the cryptocurrencies or bitcoin.

Speaker 4:          02:15:40       If somebody bought bitcoin a year ago, two years ago, five years ago, and it's now a lot higher, it's only hire because other people are more foolish than they were and other more people now believe something that's not going to happen. Why do you think it's not going to happen? And what do you think are the restrictions? Okay, so that's holding it back. All right? So people have to understand what money is and what can succeed as money, right? Because yes, dollars and euros and yen intrinsically, there's no value there. It's just a piece of paper and they're created out of thin air. But they didn't, that wasn't always the case. I mean, the dollar used to be backed by gold. And what gave the dollar value was the gold backing. That's why it had value, because you can go and get gold for it and you can convert it to gold, but gold.

Speaker 4:          02:16:26       Right? The reason that gold became money and a lot of things have been money and the most, the, the, the, what's been money, the most successful has been precious metals. People have used precious metals and gold is just spend, uh, the, the most precious of the metals that has served as money. But the reason that gold became money and because before we had money, it was all barter, right? That's, you know, [inaudible] if you, if you made a chairs and you wanted a, you know, a chicken, you had to find a guy that grew chickens who wanted one of your chairs, right? You had, it was very inefficient barter, but, uh, everybody wanted gold, or at least wealthy people wanted gold. It was a scarce item that everybody desired. But the beauty of gold was that it's all the same. You can melt it down. You announced the gold is, you know, is the same as any other ounce of gold.

Speaker 4:          02:17:19       And people realize that, wait a minute, instead of me looking for a chicken guy that wants my chair, I'll just go, uh, you know, give somebody gold. They don't need my chair. They can buy whatever they want with a gold because gold is a commodity to, it has value. But unlike a chair, it's uniform. You can put it in your pocket, you know, and, and they're all the same and you can divide up. So gold had these properties that made it money and it was a store value. And then, you know, over time there was pricing. People could relate how much is a barrel of oil terms of gold, how much is a Bushel of wheat? You can relate one commodity to another and understand pricing, right? Like, you know, uh, in, in Roman times, you know, you could buy a Toga, a nice toga for an ounce of gold, right?

Speaker 4:          02:18:07       So a man, a man could buy what was clothing back then for an ounce of gold when you can buy a suit of clothes today, a nice suit of clothes for an ounce of gold. So, you know, prices have kind of remained relatively constant and certain things. So now years ago, I guess some Libertarians and some other people got the idea, you know, crypt Fiat currencies are no good, which is true. They're not backed by anything governance, keep printing them. They got quantitative easing, 0% of the trades gold though they said Gold is inefficient, right? If I got announced the gold, I really can't use it in commerce. I mean, I can't scrape off a little piece of it and buy a cup of coffee. I can't send it across the world. And you know, and, and, and, and conduct an ecommerce. So they came up with, someone came up with a, a digital currency initiative.

Speaker 4:          02:18:51       The first one probably being bitcoin, which was supposedly replicating all the properties of gold only digitally and making it better, right? So it's like, you know, you're mine, these bitcoins, right? Even though there's no actual mining, you're solving these math problems, but you could have a bitcoin. I can give it to you, you can give it to me, I can break it in half intense, you know, and it's divisible. It's, you know, it's portable, you know, it, it doesn't decay, it doesn't go away, right? And so they'll say, hey, wait a minute, we can create a digital alternative to gold and use that. People will just use this and people will just get out of dollars and they'll, they'll own bitcoin and then we'll just use bitcoin as money. Right? And that, and the idea is this is going to happen, but it can't happen because there is no value that ultimately bitcoin has that can be stored right.

Speaker 4:          02:19:39       It, because unlike gold gold actually has properties that, that, you know, you can use gold for all sorts of things. People value gold for the metal. Nobody values bitcoin for the bitcoin. They value it because they believe that they can exchange it for something else. There's dollar doesn't really represent golden anymore. I know it doesn't, but just because the dollar is working as money with all the history of usage and the fact that the government except dollars, his taxes, it's legal tender that you have insurance products, that you have rental agreements that you have bonds. You have an entire global market in in dollars, right? That is never going to be able to develop with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Uh, ultimately the value of, of, of, of a cryptocurrency is, is based on the willingness of somebody else to accept it and exchange for, you know, for something else.

Speaker 4:          02:20:28       And you know, when bitcoin first started and people used to tell me, well, you know, there's only 21 million bitcoins, right? You can't have any more than that. So therefore there's some scarcity. But my point was that, well, but what stops somebody else from creating another cryptocurrency that is identical to bitcoin? Or maybe it's even better. Maybe it's faster. Maybe it has properties that maybe it improves on big. Just like we talked about cell phones earlier, somebody bakes a better cell phone. What's your, what's your old Motorola phone worth today is nothing, right? So if somebody comes up with a better cryptocurrency and then what's your bitcoin worth? But you know, I don't think any of these, you know, you have like a thousand of them. Now. The market cap is about 150 billion for all these cryptocurrencies and now there are people that are saying, look, you got to buy a bunch of them.

Speaker 4:          02:21:15       You need a portfolio because she, you know, you're not sure which one is going to win. None of them are going to win. They're all going to lose because none of them are going to work because they, they're there and there's no store of value. You know, your people are not using bitcoins and nor will they ever use bitcoins as a real medium of exchange. People use it as a speculative asset. People buy it, they hope it's going to go up in value. Yes. Can you sell your bitcoins and then buy something with the money? Yes. Do you could do that with any asset. You know, people make a big deal about the fact that my gold company shift gold. We accept, we say, oh, we accept bitcoin. We don't really accept Bitcoin, right? What we accept is dollars, but we make it easy for people to sell their bitcoins to buy dollars by using a service called a bit pay, but they're not actually using, uh, they're, they're, they're, uh, they're, they're a bitcoin.

Speaker 4:          02:22:05       They're using dollars, they're selling their bitcoin and then they're, then they're trading dollars. I mean, for Bitcoin and be ultimately works, right? It's not going to work because I mean, that is ultimately working. You can use their bitcoin and you can purchase gold with a bit. No, you can, you can sell your bitcoin to buy dollars and then you can use the dollars to buy Bitcoin, which meant nothing is worth dollars. No, no. You sold it. You sold your ass. Look, I, you sold nothing to get dollars and he'd take those dollars and you buy big. No, you sold, you sold something, you sold it as the big question then. So it's something then, but it's, yes, but you can sell it today for value, but it might be worthless tomorrow. I mean, not right now. It's not because somebody will pay you for it.

Speaker 4:          02:22:46       So it's real. It's the same thing as a share of, uh, of, uh, pets.com. At one point somebody would give you a lot of money for that stock and now they'll give you nothing. You know, it's all about perception. I mean, there's always value in gold. And I hear people telling me this, well, you know, gold's value is subjective. No, it's not. It's objective gold has value because it satisfies a certain, uh, desires or needs. It has properties that exist in the physical world and there are things that you can do with it. The only thing I can do with my bitcoin is give it to somebody else. But I know people think, oh, but the blockchain is, is so great. Maybe it is. Maybe the blockchain is a great invention and maybe over time, a lot of assets, we'll utilize the blockchain in transactions.

Speaker 4:          02:23:27       But it doesn't mean that just because bitcoin's utilize something of value that the bitcoin itself has any value that is going to endure to the owner of that bitcoin. Especially, you know, when there's an infinite number of coins. But here's something interesting because you know, the idea is, hey, you know, we need this digital gold because gold can't be used in commerce the way bitcoin can. The irony of it is it can, right? There's a company and you know, uh, it called gold money gold money.com and you can go there and you can open up an account. You should, everybody listening should go to goldmoney.com uh, you can do it on your cell phone, on your APP. And what they do is they allow you to buy gold. You can also buy silver and platinum play the amount of things, but let's just focus on gold.

Speaker 4:          02:24:11       You can buy gold. They sell it to you for one half of 1% over spot. Very cheap. I've been in the gold business my whole life. I've never sold gold that cheap. You own the gold. They will have a stored for you at, it brings vault of your choice and you have different locations in Switzerland and Hong Kong and Singapore and Canada. You can pick where you want your gold stored and now you own that gold, right? It's in your digital wallet. Just like you could have your crypto currencies in a digital wallet, but the difference is you can take deliver of that gold whenever you want it. The minimum is 10 grams of gold, which is a very small quantity and they will mail it to you if you want it. But the purpose of it is not to have it mailed to you. You keep it in your account.

Speaker 4:          02:24:49       Now you can give that goal. There are any portion of it to anyone you want anywhere in the world for free. I can just transfer my ownership to somebody else. So now there's commerce. If you are a merchant and you want to price your product in gold, you can do that and I can pay for the product using gold and you can accept gold in exchange for that good or service. So it makes it so that now gold can actually work in today's modern economy through the Internet. It's now is easy for me to spend my goal. I can use my goal to buy a cup of coffee. I could, my goal to buy a car. Right. So I and in the short run, right. And I'll show you this car that I have in the short run. Let's assume that somebody, is that a gold card and it's been an actual gold. It's made out of actually go. Yeah. Just real heavy. Yes. Cause gold is crazy because gold is a real element.

Speaker 3:          02:25:40       You have a guy has wait, hold credit card. This is a gold mastercard. Ladies and gentlemen. This is a gold money mastercard and this is, this is heavy. Like listen. Yeah, it's, I mean compare that to just a plastic one. Oh, it's crazy. Yeah. It's like a hundred of these. Yes. That is real. Listen to this folks. Yeah. Yeah. It's, this is fucking gold. Wow. I need one of those in my life.

Speaker 4:          02:26:04       Well you got woke up. We will. We'll make you one. I needed to get you one. Well, the idea is very appealing. Me. Let me finish this one. This one point. So in the long run, right, I believe that we're going to go back to a gold standard, I believe, and it's not just gold money, but gold money might be the first company to do that. But there may be more that we'll do it later on. But I think that government Fiat money does not work. Dollars won't work. Uros won't work. Yen don't won't work. But gold works. Gold has worked for thousands of years, but now with the Internet it works even better. And so I think that gold, like through gold money, gold money we'll do to Fiat currency, what Fedex did to the post office, what Uber is doing to taxi cabs, it is the free markets alternative, uh, money that government can't create out of thin air that will hold its value over time.

Speaker 4:          02:26:51       And now, thanks to the Internet, we can be used in commerce. But in the meantime, right, so I've got gold that is stored in my gold money account. But let's say I go to a merchant who doesn't want gold cause he doesn't know any better. He just wants to be paid in dollars. I can use this debit card, right, to buy something. And is that a debit card or credit card? Debit card, debit card. But it's a debit card and you can't tell the difference, right? But what happens is I can spend my goal using this card so I can sell off basically just like you know when people are doing with bit pay, but I don't need bitpay, right? I can go to any merchant in the world that accepts mastercard and my gold will be sold and the merchant will get dollars, right?

Speaker 4:          02:27:32       So I can spend my gold now, but the merchant is actually not getting rolled these getting dollars. But I believe in the future the merchant's going to want gold. He's, once we start to get a currency crisis, once we see the euro and the yen blowing up, people are not going to want to sell their goods and services for paper money. They're going to want to sell it for real money. Now there are people think, well, they're going to want to sell it for, for cryptocurrencies. No, they're not. I think he's cryptocurrencies are going to crash before the Fiat currencies. I think they're going to make Fiat currencies look good. Which is unfortunate because you have a lot of good people who are putting their faith in these cryptocurrencies and they're going to get burned. And then the government's going to say, you see, we told you the free market isn't any good.

Speaker 4:          02:28:13       You know, you got to trust us. You got to trust our paper money. No, I'm going to trust gold. I want to trust the private sector and if I can use gold, why would I use anything else? Now I know people say the knocked at the bitcoin people say is that, well, it's not decentralized because somebody has to store the gold. Right? Whereas nobody, right, of course, because there's real value there. But you know what brings has been storing gold for over a hundred years and they've never lost an ounce. So look, I trust banks to hold my gold, but they're holding it in a way that I can spend it, you know, back in the day, right? The first currencies that existed were created by private banks, right? Not The government. And so a bank would have gold. Or actually even before that, it was the goldsmith who would have gold, you know, that he was storing and he would write an Iou and I, you know, and the person would say, Hey, I've got gold stored at this goldsmith, that piece of paper, right?

Speaker 4:          02:29:03       Instead of going back to the Goldsmith and getting your gold, you can give somebody, say, hey look, I owe you money. Take this note because the gold is there. Th you can go get it whenever you want, but here's a piece of paper. Put it in your wallet. It entitles you to that goal. And that piece of paper could circulate as money, not because it has value, but because it's backed up by the goal. And so eventually private banks started issuing currency, physical paper currency that was backed by the goal that they had. Well, what we're having now in, in, in with gold, money is gold. Money is like the Goldsmith. They're storing your gold, but instead of giving the person that the piece of paper that you can go back, you actually get ownership. You actually transfer. So if I was going to give you $100 worth of gold from my gold money account to your gold money account, you're going to now have title to that goal.

Speaker 4:          02:29:52       It's changing hands. It's gone from me owning the golden, that vault to you, owning that exact same goal. Now, what's your goal? You can do whatever you want with it. You could take delivery of it and have it in your hand or you can use it to buy something else. It's perfect money. It's the free market money and we could use it costless. I mean, it's going to be cheap. It's cheaper than mastercard, visa. It's a very inexpensive way for people to trade across borders because it doesn't matter what country you live in. Gold has value in every country. You don't have to worry about the yen or the euro or the dollar. Hey, I'm in Germany. I want to sell my products. I can price them in gold. And Gold is not very volatile. Gold as a relatively stable, over time, you can actually price a product and get paid in gold and you can store your gold and a year later, two years later, you know what?

Speaker 4:          02:30:36       It's going to have value. Or You could look at the historic, uh, a value of gold. So rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, you know, they used to have something, they call it alchemy. You know, it's hundreds of years ago. Uh, the alchemists tried to make gold at a base metal and they couldn't do it. I look at these cryptocurrencies as modern day alchemy. They're trying to digitally recreate gold and they're not going to succeed. They're just creating digital Fiat. This is fool's gold. Yes, people have made money speculating on other people's ignorance and other people's greed, but it's going to end very badly. But I do believe that, you know, what they're doing to gold money and what the Internet is enabling is that we can have real money. We can use gold. Now in a way that you know, our forefathers never could. This is a real modern day gold standard 2.0 gold.

Speaker 4:          02:31:22       Woolworth worked better as money today than it's ever worked before, and it worked great in the past. I mean, we thrived. America was built on a gold standard. The industrial revolution happened on a gold standard. We produced a wealthiest country the world had ever seen on a gold standard, right? We've become broke, right? With his Fiat's standard. We've squandered the wealth that we created under a gold standard. But this is a way, you know, when Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971 he said it was temporary, right? Well, we don't have to wait for the government to bring us back to a gold center. You could do it on your own, right? You can put yourself, people can now move to a gold standard. You can earn a companies can pay their employees using gold money. They could pay him and gold people, landlords can collect rent and gold.

Speaker 4:          02:32:03       I mean, I hope we can have an entire society. You know? Right now we're being sidetracked by this, by this bubble in the, in the cryptocurrencies. But the people who are buying these cryptocurrencies should be buying gold. And of course what they can do now is, you know, if you happen to have some cryptocurrency, you can sell them, you can go to gold money, they'll take your, they'll let you convert your bitcoins are all coins or whatever, whatever you got, you know, ether, whatever crypto you can go and you convert it and you can buy real money. Right. And then when this bubble pops, you know, you're, you're, you're, you know, you're not left holding the bag. Cause a lot of people I think unfortunately are going to end up losing a lot of their real, their money, their purchasing power. They could have bought gold, but instead they bought, you know, pets.com and they, and they didn't, they didn't realize that that's what they would, what they were buying.

Speaker 4:          02:32:47       I'm sold Peter Schiff. I love the car. If you just get people to hold on to that. Yeah. But I mean in their hand was like this is a real thing. Yeah. I mean, and always complained about the loss of the gold standard. I mean, that was, that's a longstanding complaint. You go back to the constitution, right? Gold is money. In the constitution. It says that no state shall make anything but gold and silver coin, legal tender payment of debt. The federal government is only given the power to coin money. What are they coining? Gold and silver. I mean that that is, is the standard that you know, we have, you know, the first time we mentioned the civil war, the first time we ever had paper money in America was during the civil war and the, the union issued it, but it was, it was the greenback.

Speaker 4:          02:33:25       It was backed by gold and when the war ended, they stopped issuing them, but they issued it based on an emergency wartime power. It wasn't that they had the right to do it legally. They said, look, it's a war. We need to win this war. And so that's the first time we had paper money. Then it went away. It didn't come back again until 1913 with the Federal Reserve. Is it really possible that this can make a return? What can, that gold standard can actually be something that we all go off and I am convinced that we're going back to a gold standard, but I think the free market will lead the way because if people start rejecting government money, right? If they start rejecting the dollar, if they reject it, Europe, they reject again. Then what does the governor going to do? I mean, the source of the government's power really is the money they spent.

Speaker 4:          02:34:07       That's where they, they buy their votes and they peddle their influence. But if, if individuals and merchants just start saying, no, I don't want that paper money. You want to buy my products, pay and goal, right? You want my services, pay me in gold. And if more and more people start opting out of that system and just start working in a gold back month, which we know works, but we don't need the government to make gold money. Gold was money long before the government came around. What the government did is when they took over money, right? That's, you know, they, they would debase it, right? That's where the term comes. Because the government would start, they would make gold coins and they would stick copper in there. Other metals because they would try to create inflation. But when you had private money, you know, it was, it was gold.

Speaker 4:          02:34:46       And so we don't need the government. The problem is these cryptocurrencies, they're being marketed as the private sector's alternative. It's not gold is the alternative. But we now have, we, you know, we now have the method of, of using goals, right? Cause I, when I have this, this in my wallet, right? I can carry, but I can carry, I, if I have a $100,000 worth of gold, I have $100,000 in this wallet. It's here and I can use it to buy a pack of chewing gum. I could use it to buy a flat screen TV. I can use it to buy a car. Right? So I can buy tiny things with it. I could buy expensive things with it. And here it is. I'm carrying it around, right. And I can use it through my, my, my, my, my cell phone. I could take my cell phone and pay for stuff and ownership of my gold will instantly transfer to a third party.

Speaker 4:          02:35:33       And of course if you want to gift money, if I want to give money to my kids, I can give them gold, then they can spend it, right? They can spend that using their debit card or they can directly spend it. So this is the real ultra, this is what these cryptocurrencies are promising to be. But they never will be. But I think a lot of people are getting greedy. A lot of people think, oh, these things are going to be worth $1 million a piece and you know, pie in the sky. And it's like that greed overwhelms them and they can't think rationally. You know, in anybody that doesn't agree with them, doesn't get it. And I had the same mentality, permeates every bubble. People can't think rationally. And you know, as the price goes up, you just become more emboldened in what you believe because you're getting rewarded by the market for your mistake.

Speaker 4:          02:36:14       But you don't think it's a mistake because you're getting rich and you're looking at people like me. Hey, look, y'all, you know Peter, he's not buying. You. Look at all the money he's not making. He's a fool. He should be buying these cryptocurrencies so you know there's a, there's an old expression to don't confuse brains with a bull market. There's certainly a bull market in cryptocurrencies. I think it's a bubble, and I think that people who are making money, some of them are going to get lucky, right? Some people are going to cash out and they're going to make money, but the money that people make is going to match the money that people lose because you're going to have a lot of people who are going to come in late to the party. They're going to buy and they're going to be left holding the bag.

Speaker 4:          02:36:47       Now, of course, there's going to be a lot of losses that aren't real money. Let's say somebody bought bitcoin few years ago and they paid $1,000 and now it's worth 100,000 but they haven't sold because they think it's going to 10 million, right? If it goes to zero, all they lost was a thousand right? Even though it was worth 100,000 but mentally they lost a lot more because they thought they had all this money, right? And mentally they got used to have ela and it's going to be even more so there's going to be a lot of dreams that are going to shattered, right? Cause a lot of paper profits are going to just go to money heaven because they're just not going to be there. But ultimately the only real money that's going to be made is by the people who cash out. Cause because this is just a, you know, a self generating Ponzi scheme.

Speaker 4:          02:37:28       It's all about you know, needing new people. And that's why I think a lot of the people into the cryptocurrencies, they get so upset when somebody like me doesn't get it because they need more people. They need a bigger market, they need more buyers. To come in to keep paying a higher price to keep it all going. And so if somebody comes out and cause, you know, say the emperor has no clothes, you know, because if a lot of people decided they wanted to sell their cryptocurrencies, the price would collapse. And then what would happen? I mean, what happens if bitcoin goes from 4,000 to 1000, how do you now make an argument that it's money? How do you, how do you console the people that bought it at 4,000 and now it's at 1000 and then what if it goes to 100 and then what if it goes to zero?

Speaker 4:          02:38:08       Now, you know, there was a time bitcoin went up to a thousand and then it went down to 200 and then it rallied. So now people are convinced, okay, well if it sells off, it's just going to rally back. What if it doesn't? It doesn't, it doesn't have to come. They can keep on falling. Especially since there's so many, uh, cryptocurrencies now that compete with Bitcoin, right? I, I've said, you know, how many people search on, uh, on yahoo versus Google? I mean, yahoo was before Google or how many people are on my space today, right? I mean, you know, no, people aren't on facebook. So how do you know that, that uh, that bitcoin isn't the, the myspace of cryptocurrencies. But again, I don't think any of these cryptocurrencies will work, but I do think they will work at, they backed them by gold.

Speaker 4:          02:38:49       You can have a cryptocurrency backed by gold. The only problem there is the government won't like that because that'll work so well that the government will shut it down. The government will go. And so that's why like how will they shut it down? Well, they might say there's money laundering going on, you know, but that's why gold money, see gold money does all the know your customer. They know all the k you kyc. So when you open up a gold money account and you own physical gold, they do make sure they get your photo id. They get all this information on you. So they're, they're d, they're complying with government rules and regulations. So there's no, there's no, nobody's extorting money using gold money. There's no criminals. I mean that is where, and I've, you know, people have argued in the, I've pointed out that yes, the one place that bitcoin seem to be used as money is in crime, right?

Speaker 4:          02:39:32       If I was going to blackmail you and I was going to threaten to shut down your podcast, unless you send me some money, I can demand payment in bitcoin. And the reason I'm doing that is because of the anonymity. I think that, you know, I can get away with the crime and I don't care if the bitcoin loses 20% of its value between the time you give it to me at the time I cash it in because criminals are used to paying to launder their money. They just want whatever they get is gravy. But you know, if I'm a merchant and I'm selling, I sell gold, right? I sell gold and my margin and my gold business is about 1% so if I sell gold for $10,000 I bought it for 990 right? I have a little bit of profit. I can't afford to do that business in.

Speaker 4:          02:40:13       I mean the bitcoin can move 2% I wiped out all my profit and I've lost money. I need something that is very stable. But if I'm a criminal, just extorting money doesn't matter. So it can work for criminals, but that's where the governments could crack down on it. All right. I gotta I gotta wrap this up. So if people wanted to get involved in this, what would be the best resource for them to get information? How to get started? Well, they should go to the website, goldmoney.com just open up an account online. And the beauty of this is to, and you could do this yourself, they have a referral program that as you refer people, you send them your own link. So once you open up your gold money account, you get a referral link and now you can send it to your friend. And now if they open up an account, you get some free gold.

Speaker 4:          02:40:53       So you actually get paid. And, and, and so as you educate people, it's kind of like a marketing. But they will compensate you in an extra goal. And so, and when you open up your account, they'll give you a little free gold. You get a little free gold for referring somebody to sponsor it on this podcast. You should be a little bit of free google. Yes you can. I mean, in fact the number of people that you have on the podcast, you can get a lot of free goals. It seems like you could have a big ad, like our whole podcast was a big, a big fake ad for Frigo. Yeah, well it's, well, it's really for the concepts of freedom. Gold is economic freedom, right? I mean that's like even Alan Greenspan, that was the title of his essay. Gold and economic freedom. But it is, and you know, the more people that we can move into their own personal gold standard, the more people that can save in gold.

Speaker 4:          02:41:38       And the beauty of like a gold money account. You have your money in a bank account. What if the bank fails? You know, this money is banked. Your gold is bank, but you own it. It's not being loaned out to anybody. It's in a storage facility with your name by breaks. So you can spend it. When you put your money in a bank account, they loan it out to somebody you know. And you know there's government insurance, but so what? They just have to print a bunch of money. You're, you can bank your gold without having to put it into the banking system. There's no bail ins that you have to worry about. Or Bank failures. You don't have to worry about inflation. It doesn't matter how much money the government prints, they're not mining any gold. Gold is going to maintain its value. So to the extent that you don't spend it right away, it's going to gain value between the time you deposited or the time you earn it and the time you go to spend it.

Speaker 4:          02:42:22       So it's a great store of value. But thanks to the Internet, it is the best medium of exchange. It's cause it's so easy now to do it so you can get out. You know, you could promote it. The people that listen to the podcast. I mean, and again, there are other people that say, oh Peter, you know, you don't like bitcoin because you, you're promoting gold money that, you know, I, if I thought bitcoin was going to work, believe me, I'd have been all over it. Right? I mean, I have a person, a very high principles and standards. You know, I started selling gold long before I had a gold company. I used to tell my brokerage accounts at your Pacific capital. I would tell them, look by some gold and I would just send them, does it go buy it? I didn't sell it. And the money that they use to buy gold was money I couldn't manage. You know, I'd make money managing money for fee or commissions. And if people took their money and bought gold, I wasn't making any money, but I thought they should buy it because it was the right thing to do. And I got involved with gold money because I, that they were onto something.

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       I thought that they were doing something big. It's more than just about money. It's about a crusade to take back our freedom, which I think Berlin, uh, begins with money taking the power away from government is rejecting the source of that power, which is the money they spend to corrupt the economy. So to the extent that more and more people, I mean, this is the most important vote. It doesn't matter who you vote for in the, in an election, vote with your feet on the money, vote away from the Fiat based system and vote in favor of goal. Right? That's the, that's the monetary system that our founders believed in. That's what was embodied in the constitution. And that's what worked. And you get to that sweet car that's made an actual, the sweet card feel good. Yes, you get, you can get a plastic card for free. Oh, I want that. But you have to pay for the gold card. But the beauty of it is it's worth its weight in gold. So even though you have to pay for it, you own that gold. It's worth it. Yes, because it's actual gold. You can melt it down. It's good to have. Yes. I mean you need to have one in my life. People have, people have to understand who you want to. You want to let me hold it one more time.

Speaker 2:          02:44:10       One a hold of Jamie. Yeah, I feel that. Feel that there's not that many people that have those, but feel that that feels legit. Doesn't it actually better than a black card? Wait, yes. Way better than black. And you know what an Asshole, they actually have all the cost shares, you know, they, they sign up to, you can get all those benefits to oh, like to chant with American Express, they sign you as yes, they have the cost shares. They have all those programs. So you don't give that stuff up. You just have, you just have real money, you know, behind. You're just have to make sure that if you throw it into a restaurant that, that you get it back. I like it. Listen, we're going to come back next time you're here.
