Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Four three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       And we're live. All right, so to set this up, um, when Gary was on last, Gary Tobbs, Stefan, how do I say your last name? Stephanie. DNA. DNA. DNA. It's like DNA, like DNA with a g. Right. Got It. Okay. Um, when you were on last, Stephan had, uh, some opposition to some of the things that you were saying. We talked about getting him on and you want it together. We finally pulled it off. Took there was a lot of wrangling was a lot of back and forth and cat wrangling, but we got it. We're here. Um, give me your position on this is all for folks listening, this is all about obesity and the mechanism for obesity. Is that fair to say?

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Yeah. Yeah. So essentially the main points that we want to talk about today, I'll try to keep this up just from your face. Okay, sure. Just so you move around, um, what causes obesity and what causes insulin resistance, which is behind a lot of our chronic diseases that are common in society. And please, uh, give us your background. Yeah. So I have a bs in biochemistry, Phd in neuroscience. After getting my phd in neuroscience, I went on to study the neuroscience of obesity at the University of Washington in particularly the brain circuits that regulate body fatness. Hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about those today. And then I went on to become a science consultant at science communicator and write a book called the hungry brain. That is, um, my attempt to explain for a non specialist audience what, uh, what causes obesity and uh, yeah, so that's my background.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Now, what is your disagreement with Gary's position? Everything. Everything. Yeah. So, uh, how about, how about I just, can I start by explaining what I believe because it'd be saying I'm going to be long winded here. Is that okay? Go right ahead. All right. We have ours. Okay, cool. So first, a little bit of housekeeping. I'm going to be citing a lot of evidence today and so I want these bringing this up to your focus. Sure. Just moving around. Sure. If you want to sit back. How's that? Perfect. Okay. I'm going to be citing a lot of evidence today and I want people to be able to follow along at home. And so I put many of the references that I'm going to be siting on that so it doesn't cover your face. Okay, there we go. All right. I put a lot of the references that I'm going to be siting on my website Stephin bna.com or if you don't feel like spelling my name, you can go to whole health source.org and I have a numbered list of topics there and I'm going to be calling out numbers.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       Just scroll down to the number that I referred to and the references are all there. The second thing I want to say that I would want to be really clear about today is that I'm not here to be the anti low carb guy. Okay. Um, I think low carb diets are valid tool for a controlling body, fatness and controlling blood sugar. I'm not here to talk anybody out of being on a low carb diet. Um, what I am here to try to talk people out of this. Some of the mythology that has accumulated around the low carb diet. Okay, so I want to get started with an analogy to help people understand, um, why the brain is important and obesity. So imagine you're an alien coming down from outer space and you want to understand what's going on on earth and you notice that on the highway some cars are traveling faster than others.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       Some cars go faster, some cars go slower and you want to figure out why. And so you go and you start studying the tires of the cars because obviously the amount of force that is exerted by the tire onto the asphalt is the thing that determines the speed of the car. We know this, this is just physics. And so you study the tires and you study the tires and you study them and you never figure out why some cars go faster than others. Now why is that? The reason is that you're studying the wrong part of the system. You want to understand the why. Some cars go faster than others. You have to understand the part of the system that regulates speed, and that is the person behind the wheel. And so in this analogy, the tires are fat cells and the person behind the wheel is the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       There has been tons of research on fat cell biology on what factors put fat in fat cells, what take it out. It's been tons and tons of research on that and it's intuitively obvious that we should be studying that to understand obesity, right? But in fact, all of that research has yielded very little insight into why some people are fatter than others. That's because it's the wrong part of the system. Study fat cells do not regulate the size of fat cells any more than the tires on a car regulate the speed of the car. The thing that regulates the size of fat cells is the brain. So let's talk about, um, first of all, give you a little framework for thinking about this. The brain evolved over about 600 million years to promote the survival and reproduction of our ancestors. And over the course of that time we evolved all of these different brain circuits that have specialized functions.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       They generate our hunger and our cravings and our fullness feelings. They generate our eating behavior, what and how much we eat. And they actively regulate the amount of fat on our bodies. And that's one of the things I want to talk about. And all of these circuits evolved. And these are nonconscious by the way. So you don't decide. You want to be hunger, you don't decide that you want to have a craving. These are things that bubble up from nonconscious parts of your brain that you don't control. So, um, these circuits are calibrated to an environment of our ancestors, not the environment where we're living in right now. So these circuits all evolved to function optimally in the environment of our ancestors, promote the survival and reproduction of our ancestors. So, um, what happens when you put these brain circuits in the modern environment where you have abundant calorie, dense, tasty foods, rich and carbohydrate and fat is these same brain circuits push us to over consume and they push our bodies to accumulate and hold onto fat.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       And then what you see as a result is the three hallmarks of obesity. First of all, the obvious, you see elevated body fat mass. Second of all, you see elevated calorie intake. People with obesity consume more calories than people who do not have obesity after correcting for height and sex and physical activity level. And third, you see that people with obesity defend their higher level of body fatness against changes. And so there's actually a regulatory change that happens. It's not conscious defense, you know, they're not trying to remain obese. It's these body fat regulatory circuits. And this is where Gary gets it right, is that people with obesity are not just lean. People who eat more calories. There's actually a change in the regulatory activity that regulates body fat in the body. And we can get back to how that happens. But I'll just leave it there for now.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       So up until this point, I've basically just been telling a plausible story, right? I mean, I haven't actually cited any evidence yet to support that. My story is correct. Um, and so let's get into that. Let's talk about what some of the evidence is that supports this idea that I've just laid out. So I want to start with, um, the genetics of obesity. I think this offers some wait, can I interrupt for one second? Uh, as long as it's very brief, the question I don't, I still don't quite understand what the model is. Okay. This regulation, if you don't understand the model, how about I lay out, how about I finish laying it out and then you can ask a question because I may answer your question over the course of a continuing. So let me, let me just finish. Um, okay. So now the genetics of obesity offers us a lot of insight into the biological mechanisms that drive differences in body fatness in the general population.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       So you get these studies, like the, the most interesting studies are the genome wide association studies. They get hundreds of thousands of people together and they, um, sequence or they, they measure all these markers in their genomes and they figure out what parts of the genome makes some people fatter than another. So if you have version a in this particular location, you end up a little fatter than if you have version B. And when you look at all the places where this is happening, you can see the genes where it's happening in. And that tells you, if you look at what those genes are doing, that tells you what the mechanisms are that underlie every day differences in body, in the general population. And so to kind of warm ourselves up, let's start by talking about height genes. So height has a strong genetic component, so it was body fatness and researchers has figured out a lot of the genes that underlie differences in height between people.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       And when you look at what those genes do, they tend to be involved in the growth and development of the skeleton and the connective tissue, which is what you would expect, right? Cause growth of the skeleton determines your height. So genes that determine diabetes risk type two diabetes are all about insulin sensitivity, all about insulin secretion and the function of the insulin secreting pancreas, which is what you expect because diabetes is a disease that is all about insulin. So these studies are really good at getting at the underlying biological mechanisms that are driving these phenomena. So what do these studies have to say about obesity? If Gary's model is correct, we should see a bunch of genes popping up related to fat cells and insulin. If my model is correct, we should see a bunch of genes popping up related to the brain. And in fact, that's exactly what we see.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       The genetics of obesity are overwhelmingly related to differences in brain activity between individuals and um, okay, so that's one piece of evidence. Another piece of evidence. There are five FDA approved weight loss drugs. Four of those act in the brain. One of them reduces dietary fat absorption in the digestive tract. There are no effective fat loss drugs and I'm aware of the target insulin and fat cells. Third piece of evidence. Um, if you look at, some people get really unlucky in life and they end up with these horrible genetic mutations that, you know, knock out some biological pathways. Some of these people end up with extreme obesity people and also animals. We see this in mice and rats. Just occasionally you get unlucky and you get really, really fat. And researchers have been cataloguing. What are these mutations? When we find people who are genetically really obese, what are these mutations that are making them fat?

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       What is the biological mechanism that's getting screwed up that's making them fat? And what they've found is that all of these mutations that they've identified to date, a number of them are occurring in the Leptin signaling pathway. And this is the Leptin, um, is the primary fat regulating hormone in the body. Gary avoids this, never talks about this in his writing, but Leptin is the primary fat regulating hormone in the body. And these mutations either knock out Leptin, they knock out leptin receptors or they knock out the left and response pathway in the brain. And um, so that's the third piece of evidence. Okay. So now we haven't really gotten around to talking about what it exactly about the bad interaction that happens between our ancient brains and the modern food environment that causes us to become fat. Um, we've established that the brain is central to obesity, but we haven't really established what it is exactly about that interaction.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       Why does our modern food, why does our modern environment promote obesity? Right? So I'm basically, there are three different ways that I'm going to look at this from, um, but first I want to say that the, probably the best way to answer this question is to start with the question, what is the most fattening diet in the world? What is the Diet that is more fattening than any others? And the answer to that is it's human junk food in a variety of non human species and humans. It's human junk food that is more fattening than any others. And I'm going to skip over some of the research here, um, that demonstrates this. By the way, I haven't been calling out numbers here. Okay. Let me call out some numbers. Um, reference number two on my website is, um, those genetic studies. Reference number one is the obesity drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       Reference number six is those spontaneously occurring genetic mutations? And now I'm talking about reference number 52. So I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna Gloss over some of the individual research cause I'm being long winded here. But um, essentially what you find is that this stuff is really fattening and animals, many different species. It's super fattening and humans calorie dense. When you put create an environment with abundant easy calorie, dense, tasty foods, rich carbs and fat, you see this dramatic overconsumption in fact game across many species including humans. And what you find in the research is that the sugar and the carbohydrate cannot explain that they're part of the effect. Yes, they explained part of it. But you cannot replicate that effect by only feeding sugar and carbohydrate. You can't replicate it in animals. You can't replicate it in humans. When you say you can't replicate it, you mean you can't replicate obesity?

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       What do you mean? Yeah. Um, that's right. You cannot, you cannot cause the same degree of fat gain, the same extent of fat gain, the same extent of overconsumption using only sugar and carbohydrate that you can cause with a variety of calorie dense, palatable human foods. You can't fully replicate it with sugar and carbs. You cannot fully replicate it with fat alone either. If you put those when we can, we can get deeper in this if you want, but I'm confused. So you're, you're saying that the, the Diet that causes the most obesity is what we think, right? This a human junk food diet in sugar, simple carbs, bullshit, bullshit diet, right. What do you, you're saying that you can't replicate that with just your arms slowly replicated fully and so it's, what I mean is that if you just feed, if you just increase sugar intake in animals or in humans, you do get weight gain, but it is modest compared to what you get when you put people around a variety of calorie dense, palatable foods, rich and carbohydrate and fat.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       Similarly, if you, that's very confusing. How's that? Because I'm not sure exactly what you're saying. You're saying you, if you give people this calorie rich sugar diet of junk food, you will make them gain weight but not as much weight as what? Um, so what I'm saying is that if you, if you give people or animals the, the actual human junk food with all the carbs and fat and everything, they gain a lot more weight and a lot faster than if you just give them a diet that's high in sugar and high in refined carbohydrate. And what that shows is that the sugar and they're fine carbohydrate cannot fully explain the effect. Can't fully explain why those foods are fattening. See this is where I'm confused. No, I don't see what you're saying cause you're, you're saying if you give people the Diet of American junk food, you, you get not as much of an effect if you give them just the sugar and the carbohydrates, you're saying?

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Yep. So, but what are you giving them when you're giving them the, the Diet of junk food, you give her a 10 for example, in animals now it's different because if you think about human junk foods, generally those foods contain fat and carbohydrate and salt and all kinds of other things. So it's more, it's more than just let's a lot, so carbs and sugar. So I'll get in more detail. So the ways that you can do this, you can add sugar, just sugar table sugar to the feed of animals. That's one way to do it. Or you can add it to their drinking water. Sometimes it's a little bit fattening, sometimes it's not. It's not that fattening and animals and humans, you can ask them to drink sugar sweetened beverages that are just sugar and you can see what happens and people will gain weight or you can tell them to stop drinking sugar sweetened beverages and you can see what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       Okay. People will gain weight, they will lose weight suggesting that that is part of the explanation, but it's a much smaller effect than you see with this full pallet of these foods that contain carbs and fat and all this other stuff that you're saying car. Well obviously there's more calories, right? If there's carbs and fat and all these other, correct. If you think that calories matter, then we agree. Oh, for short matters, right? Gary doesn't think it matters. You don't think it matters. Well, let me think. It's the wrong way to think about it. What, what do you disagree if anything with what he said so far? Well, so far what he said, it hasn't been particularly

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       revenue. Latori um, the, uh, I think we have to step back for a second because you know, while the low carb community might have a more better understanding of where we disagree, um, I think the greater community that Joe Reaches might not so fundamentally with Stefan saying and what the research community saying and the conventional thinking in this field is that the brain, and correct me any point I get this wrong, but the brain regulates, does the fundamental job of controlling how fast we are and the way it does it is by controlling or miss controlling our intake and our expenditure and the different tents up in fat tissue. Is that fair to say for the most primarily intake but yet, yeah. So Stefan has a brain centric view of the universe and the car community at large does as well. So if we go outside and we walked down, you know, Ventura Boulevard and we see someone who weighs 400 pounds, um, they've clearly taken in more calories than they should have over the course of their life. And it's been stored in their fat tissue. And Stefan says, I think would say that the problem is in their brains ability to regulate intake to expenditure. Is that correct? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:19:18       And let me, I have to fix my headphones. So how are we going to do this? I'm getting feedback when I talk. You getting feedback? Yeah, it's just weird. It could be the, hold on one sec. For those who don't know, I'm hearing impaired as they say kindly. My kids would say deaf as a post, so I took off my hearing aids and it's a little better. Okay. So what I've been arguing, so I come along my background, I'm a journalist, I'm an investigative journalist with a science background. Okay. That's what I do. And I'm curious and I've got a lot of, you know, and I, my first two books were studying what's called pathological science, which is about people who've got the wrong results in science because a lot of times scientists do so by, I'm very sensitive to this. And as I was doing the research for my first book, which took five years, what I noticed in when you take a historical perspective is that the research community studying obesity was very focused on the brain.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       They just assume that that people are gluttons and I'm going to use some socially unacceptable, uh, language because in part that's how they thought about. And in fact, when you read the, uh, obesity literature from the forties and 50s, it's shocking the way these people talked about people with obesity. And the assumption was that they're gluttons are, they're neurotic or they're anxious or they're just, you know, but, but it was all brain center. And when they go out to the 1960s, the field was being run by psychologists and psychiatrists who are trying to get people with obesity eat less. And it, my favorite example is one team that was trying to get they, they got the wives to stop having sex with the husband if they didn't lose weight every week. And now with motivate them, I think even you point out that sex is a greater motivator in your book.

Speaker 3:          00:21:09       Then tasty foods. It didn't say it was greater but I said it was on par or on par. So, and I'm going to just read you a, I won't read you that the, so there was this, while the obesity research community is focusing on the brain, there were people studying fat metabolism and an endocrinologist. They studied hormones and hormone related disorders saying that the oh you know, fat storage and fat mobilization, the burning of fat and the human body is controlled by this very diverse set of hormones and enzymes and the nervous system is involved in well and our body does a very careful job of deciding basically orchestrating how we use fields after we eat. And the implication was, and I think Stefan kind of stepped into this with the very first thing you said. So the assumption was obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       So today when you read the literature, the articles we'll opposite. Obesity is a sort of energy imbalance. You take in more calories than they expend. There were still the best scientists in the field, the best physician scientist with they look obesity, a sort of excess fat accumulation. Let's look at what regulates fat accumulation. The human body. Some people are programmed or dysregulated to store more fat and if the store more fat, they're going to, their behavior is going to respond, they'll be hungry or they'll eat more, there'll be gluttons, all these things. So it was a switching the causality instead of the brain determining energy balance and that determining fat accumulation. The idea was sort of, let's see, what regulates fat accumulation. If that's dysregulated, if I have a, if I give birth to a daughter who weighs a hundred pounds at age four I'm not going to worry about how much he eats and exercises.

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       I'm going to worry about what's going on with fat accumulation and this young girl that her body is just as if you give a, you know, if you have a child who's six foot eight when he was six years old, you're not going to worry about how much he eats an exercises. You're going to worry that he's over secreting growth hormone. So the idea, basically what I've done, my role in this is to say look in this vitally important period in the 1960s and 1970s when obesity researchers came to understand fat metabolism researchers came to understand that regulation of fat cells, the obesity people were convinced that the problem was in the brain. And those obesity people eventually grew into the world that Stefan got his PhD in neuro biological world where you study what's happening in the brain and you ignore what's happening in the fat cells and fat mobilization and fatty acid oxidation and tad Stuart.

Speaker 3:          00:24:02       And when you look at that, you find a whole world of places in which people can pre be predetermined, you know, be driven to be fat. So, for example, when I was in high school, senior year in high school, I weighed 195 pounds and I played football and my brother two years older, weight 195 pounds his senior year and played football. My brother never got more than 195 pounds and I went up to two 40. We both ate as much as humanly possible. You know, as you could imagine, that's what high school athletes do. My brother was always a lien. I was always chubby. My brother stayed lean and became an endurance athlete. I became a football player and I lifted weights. I put on muscle easily and I fattened easily. He didn't. Um, the conventional wisdom would be the reason I went to two 40 and he never got to one 95 was that my brain was different than his. My argument is our bodies were fundamentally different. So if I see somebody walking down the street or weighs 300 pounds, I don't worry about, I don't think about what the problem is with her brain regulating intake and expenditure. I think about what's, why is her body driving her to be 300 pounds? So that's, I think, kind of the fundamental difference. Um, and is it, is it the brain that can't do the job or is it the body that can't do the job and the brain is responding to what's happening in the body?

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       Yeah. Is this a reductionist perspective? Cause I mean, isn't it a holistic, I mean holistically you're looking at the entire machine of the human body. The idea that the brain is somehow or another separate from the body is saying it's separate. The question is, is a brain driving what's happening in the body or is it responding to whatever? Um, and you know, the brain of course does respond a lot to what's happening in the body and we can talk about that and how that works. Um, but you know, I think it's, we can tell stories, but the things, the thing that differentiates a story that's true from a story that is not true is evidence. And so, you know, you talk about the difference between your brother and you. This is where that genetics evidence comes back in that I was talking about your brother and you only share half of your genes.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       We know that genetics has a strong impact on who has a greater susceptibility to body fatness and not than others. And we also know what the genes do that underlie those differences and they are primary. I'm not done Gary, let me finish those genes. Those genes. Nope. Nope, not right now. I'm in the middle of saying something. Those genes are primarily related to differences in brain function. That is what the genetic say. And so that suggests that the reason why you had a greater propensity than your brother to become fat probably has to do with differences in genetics that relate to brain function. That is what the research says. Okay, very actually look when you talked about two 17 year olds that way, exactly the same amount. Like how do we know how much they consumed in calories? I mean, we don't have any studies.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       We don't have any, I mean I can guarantee you we both paid as much as humanly possible. Right? But I'm actually my brother who never got over one 95 and I apologize for bringing you up on the air. I know you don't like that used to say that he never gets stuffed. He just gets bored of eating after a couple of hours. Okay, okay. But I mean that'd be even though like maybe if you looked at it scientifically, you ate more than him or maybe you ate more sugar, more carbs. So that's a difference. So the, those are the two hypothesis. One hypothesis is my body and this is what Stefan is talking about. So I want to just, the thing I wanted to read, how much, I'll ask you the question, how much of the variation in human obesity to those genes explain? So if you look at the genetics of that, I didn't ask how much let's talking.

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       Yeah, you got to look to please Gary. So if you look at the genetics of obesity, what you find is that from twin studies and family studies that measure the overall contribution of genetics, about 75% of the differences in body fatness between individuals is due to genetic differences between those individuals. So, you know, 1995 America, if you just take a cross section of people and you measure how much is genes, how much is environment, about 75% is genetic. Now we've only identified a small proportion of the specific genes that underlie the propensity to obesity. And so if you look at the percentage that we have specifically identified, it's a very small, and that's what I refer to in my book. How much it's like a, right now I think it's up to about 10% it was 3% when your book was published. That's correct. And they did 7% absolutely.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       Yeah. The latest. Yeah. Actually, let me cite the, uh, so while the study, they're just a second, I'm going to cite this study just a second. I'm gonna cite this study. Uh, this study is under reference number two. So you can, you can go check that out. It's about 10% and these genetic studies are advancing very quickly. And that's why in the three years since I wrote that, we have explained a lot more than we did at the time that I wrote that. And so we have a portion of these genes identified and what we're seeing is that most of that portion that we have identified relate to brain activity. And so that tells us that primarily the differences between individuals that determined differences in body. And this is about

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       differences in brain activity. And no one should be shocked about this. The brain generates all of our eating behavior. It generates all of our physical activity behavior and it actually regulates body fatness. No one should be surprised by this. I am. And I was. And how were you surprised you again? Now if you disagree with virtually everything, but, um, let's begin with track back now. The um, okay, so drugs that explain obesity 10% with the argument that I was making and the argument I continued to make. Imagine if you don't, we'll take Stefan's, uh, car medicine's Stefan. He says, Steph. Okay. It's okay. I'm not saying that, but I mean that people don't get confused. Thank you. The, if you take Stephan's car analogy and somewhere in the 1970s, I, I've used the car analogy for this too, but I don't think it's as appropriate.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       But one way to think that somewhere in the 1970s, the aliens didn't notice that there were humans driving the car. So now they're trying to solve the problem without the humans involved. Well, I see some cars drive faster than others and they come up with all kinds of hypotheses and some of them can explain it even when they interpret the hypotheses. One of the common problems and science has called intellectual face lock. So what I've been arguing is in effect the obesity research community left out of its research, 1960s era endocrinology, the hormonal metabolic regulation of fatty acid metabolism, oxidation burning. And it sucks when they did it. Pretty much everything they've done since has been interpreted incorrectly. Just like the aliens would interpret the car problem if they never notice the humans. So, um, and Leptin is a good example. So Leptin is discovered in 1993 and when Leptin is discovered, obesity becomes sort of a legitimate field of science.

Speaker 3:          00:31:45       Until then, it's a bunch of actually mostly psychologists studying it and now it becomes a subdiscipline and molecular biology and all the molecular just jump into the field and they assume that would let them, does, is controlled the brain signals how much fat is available to some kind of satiety or field efficiency [inaudible] hormone. And as such, they studied the brain and they studied the action of Lipton in the brain. Now in 2002, Jeff Friedman who gets credit for discovering Leptin perhaps incorrectly, um, publishes a paper in the journal Science. It's saying perhaps as much as two thirds or more of what Leptin does is done in the periphery in the body. And what Leptin does, it's a hormone that sort of is, is secreted in response to how much fat you've accumulated. And then does it stimulate the brain to tell you to eat more or less depending on how much fat or it also works in liver cells, which are the cells that were studying.

Speaker 3:          00:32:48       And the assumption is it probably doesn't all cells to tell yourselves to burn fat. So it makes perfect sense if there's fat available in the fat cell is now you've got a signal telling sort of influencing the other cells of the body to burn fat. So now you've got a hormone that could work in the periphery, in the, in the below then neck or it could work above the neck. But you've got a community that to almost exclusively studying in the head. They don't know they're a human drivers down here. So that's what they do. So even in this world, the, the I, I don't, I think I know the genome paper I'm Stefan is probably referenced on, that's the reason. Is it the, I don't remember the, so they had two papers cause it's what you cited in the article you coauthored with Rudy Leibel.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       So I have two papers. One is genes associated with obesity and one is genes associated with body type. So with body type, they're all below the neck. They're all, you know, fat metabolism basically. And the Musk, the genes at aspects of your body that you would expect to be controlled. Like when you build up muscle and you have to take an excess energy to do it. It makes you hungry. I don't think your brain is regulating how much muscle you're building other than your drive to go to the gym. Basically your body is responding to the stress on the muscle, all the things you do and the weightlifting. It's all below the neck. So the argument here is again simple. When these people looked at body type, it was insulin regulated genes for the most part, growth hormone, all of these things. When they looked at excess body fat, they decided they were in the head.

Speaker 3:          00:34:35       But the question is when they looked their program to think that excess body fat, it's caused by overeating. So they look in the brain. Did they do the same kind and I was going to call the researcher involved. I never got around to doing it. Saying if body type body shape is determined by these genes and it doesn't make sense that x has variations of body shape, we're going to be determined by the same genes. And did you just do the same kind of searches? I don't actually know how they determine where the genes work. It's the same kind of searches. They just came up with different sets of genes. So they didn't start with any assumptions. They were just finding the questionnaire where the genes work. So there's a common phenomenon. All this like with Leptin, a gene that everybody thinks about working in the hypothalamus seems to work and everything.

Speaker 3:          00:35:23       Can I respond to that talking cause you say this in your head, you say this in your book. Go ahead. I'm prepared to respond whenever you're done. Okay. In your book you say that gene's work you, the body is very, basically, it puts a different mechanisms to work as many places that can. And there these homeostatic feedback loops, you know, something happens. Your whole body has to respond. So a gene that my work primarily on one cell is scattered all over the body because every cell, and it'll do different jobs on different cells. But if you think that the problems in the brain, that's where you look, you said you get this kind of intellectual phase lock where that's what we do. That's what we study. And neurobiologists studies the brain. Uh, uh, Daniel Conaman, I just stepped in like suicide Daniel Economy and as well had this concept.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       What you see is all, he's a Nobel laureate, uh, cognitive psychologists. What you see is all there is. Okay. And basically if you're studying the brain, that's what you look at if you're studying the gun until we all get trapped into that on some extent. And what I'm saying is, even in these studies, so Stefan, Stefan wrote a book about the hungry brain that is supposed to be about obesity, but in fact, you never mentioned anything about the metabolic regulation of fat accumulation. It's just not there. And I would argue it has to be there. Even if it's wrong, if it's not there, the absence of it. Like you can't talk about Leptin without talking about what it might be doing in the body. You can talk, you know, so there's a the end, it's put me in a very odd position. So Stephan is kind of the defender of the Orthodox and I'm the one who comes along and says, look, you guys just, you missed it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       You screwed up. You had psychologists and psychiatrists running the field when the endocrinologist sob that and then you discovered Leptin and it became a molecular biology problem and you're now divorced from the very simplest observations about obesity. You know, so we can do huge genome wide association studies. A sound remarkable. But if I were to ask a simple question like why is it I get fat here? Yeah, the love handle thing, it's in the back with man. It's not in the front, but it's here and not here. I don't see what the brain has to say about that. Um, okay. So, as you mentioned, there have been different genetic studies that have looked at body fat distribution versus total body fatness. So total body fat, and this is what we're talking about when we're talking about obesity. Uh, body fat distribution is what we're talking about when we're talking about the fat being on your hips versus on your wrist. Now what we see is different sets of genes that come up. So body fat distribution, we actually see insulin, a related genes, so people that have a central body fat distribution, so body fat around their waist tend to have these insulin related genes that are driving that. But when you look at total body fatness, the thing that causes obesity, what you see is that those genes

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       are dominated by the brain. And the really cool thing, the point I want to make about the genetics research 10% is that it seems might be dominated by the brain if say, look, come on Gary. It is unbiased. That's the really cool thing about it is that they're just, this is whatever genes are popping up. These studies do not care about what you believe about what causes obesity. This is just whatever genes are popping up. So it's unbiased and that's what they're saying and I'm not done here. Gary. Now I want to talk about, um, you mentioned Gary, that maybe Leptin is having important actions, not just in the brain but in the body. First of all, I'm glad, I'm flattered that you read my book and I'm glad that you acknowledge the existence of Leptin. Now this is good. Um, but now you say that researchers focus on Leptin actions in the brain because we're phase locked and we can't get out of our, you know, blinders of thinking about it in terms of the brain and that that's why we focus on left an action in the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       The real reason we focus on left in action in the brain is because it has been demonstrated that it's effect on body. Fatness are via the brain. There are actual experiments demonstrating this, and I'll explain how these experiments work. This is all in the scientific literature. So if you knock out the Leptin receptor only in the brain or only in the Hypothalamus, you get obesity. So that is what tells us that actually the brain is the key site of action. And particularly this challenge. It tells me Gary Key site, please let him talk. He let you talk. Yeah. And that's it. So I mean you get the same obesity if you knock leaped and how to the brain and particularly out of the hypothalamus that you get if you knock it out of the whole body. So that shows that the brain is this site of action that is causing this to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       And this is no surprise. We have these mechanisms worked out. We know specific groups of neurons that are receiving the left and that are controlling our appetite, that are controlling our metabolic rate. We have many of these neuro populations worked out in mice. We understand these systems so well. We can control specific popular tiny populations of neurons very precisely. Caused them to eat a ton, to stop eating, to gain fat, to lose fat like the animals are marionettes. I mean that's the level of understanding we have right now of how these systems work. So I mean all of this evidence is converging on the same thing that the brain is central and that fat cell metabolism, I'm just not seeing the evidence for that. I mean, Gary, if you want to cite specific evidence demonstrating that that is an actual cause of differences in body fatness between individuals in the general population.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       I'm awaiting that evidence and I'm happy to sit here and listen to you cite the evidence that demonstrates. Can I, can I pause here and Leptin is produced where? Yeah, Leptin is produced. Yeah. Let's talk about Leptin a little bit. It's produced in fat cells and it's produced in proportion to the size of fat tissue. So the amount of body fat you have, the more fat you have, the more Leptin you have in the circulation. And basically what this is, it's what's called a negative feedback loop, which is a really simple engineering term that works like a thermostat. So with your Thermostat, you uh, if you set your thermostat to 70, if it starts getting a little bit of hotter, your ac turns on to bring it back down at the starts getting lower, ac comes on or the heat comes on to bring it up.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       That's called a negative feedback system and it maintains the stability of the temperature of your house. We have many negative feedback loops in the human body to regulate body temperature, to regulate blood pressure, to regulate all sorts of things. One of the negative feedback loops we have regulates body fatness and the hormones. So your, your thermostat measures temperature by using a thermostat, a Saria, a thermometer, your brain measures body fatness using this hormone leptin that's in the circulation. And then particularly when your body fat level drops, your Leptin levels drop and your brain hears that and it kicks in a starvation response basically. And this is the main reason why weight loss is so difficult because your brain is like, no, I don't want to be losing fat. And it makes you hungrier. It increases your cravings. Yes. Is that a certain level of body fat as a sub.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       So here's this, just when you're losing body fat in general, like even if you're a large person that's overweight, correct. When you're losing body fat in general, your body, it exacerbates your hunger. And this is, this is the thing that's really important to understand about obesity is that people with obesity have a higher set point. So it's like turning your thermostat from 70 to 80 and then your thermostats of regulating around 80 people with obesity, they're not regulating around one 70 anymore. They're regulating around two 50 and so when you cause a lean person to lose weight, you see the same thing is when you cause a person with obesity to lose weight, you see this reaction in their brain circuits that regulate body fatness that drives them to increase their cravings and their hunger to metabolic rate drops. So it'd be an evolutionary mechanism to force you to seek food.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       Correct. And not just the foresee to seek food. That's the main thing. But it also slows your metabolic rate, does everything it can to get more energy in your body. And have less leaving and it keeps doing that until the fat comes back. Can I pause here? Yeah. So when you're eating a sugary die at a high high calorie diet, you will produce more fat. Your body will get fatter, right? Um, it depends on how many calories you're eating. If you're overeating, you consuming a lot of sugar, a lot of carbohydrates, your body will get fatter. So your body will produce more Leptin. Correct. So it comes from the

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       um, yeah, indirectly, definitely pause, please. So the Leptin is produced not just in response to the size of the fat tail, but in response actually to glucose and a mediated uptake into the fat cell, which is mediated in part by insulin. So you come back to insulin, even with the Leptin, you raise blood sugar and that's the carbs. You eat the carbs, you raise blood sugar, you raise insulin, you raise fat storage, the glucose, and then you get more leaped. And um, again, one of the things you have to understand about this is everything that's said has two interpretations, depending on which paradigm you're looking in. And these are fundamentally different paradigms. So in Stephen's world, and again, correct me if I'm wrong though, the Leptin is signaling few all availability in the fat cells the way I would think of it. And in my very small world and Leptin is responding to fuel availability in the rest of the cells.

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       So it's basically a molecule that can tell other cells that there's fat available and you could burn that fat for fuel and then you don't have to go eat or it can tell that there isn't fuel available. And if, depending on how much left in there is the cells and then that what respond by a signal to eat or not to disinhibit eating behavior. Um, everything we're talking about with Stefan and I first sort of fell out, I dunno, eight years ago at ancestral health symposium when I acted improperly inappropriately. But one of the problems I had to, the way I think you should think about this, you have a hypothesis, and this is the fundamental thing, is it obesity caused by overeating? Because we know if you're getting fatter, you're storing more calories in your expense. That's just the, you know, that's like if a room is getting more crowded, more people are entering them.

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       Leaving. That is the simplest, but it doesn't tell you why the room's getting crowded. It doesn't tell you why you're getting fatter. And again, what I've been arguing is the why you're getting fatter. Part has been left out and people decided that overeating was somehow an explanation and then they went to the brain to look at white people might overeat. So what I, one of the questions I asked to find eight years ago, and it keeps coming up as if we're going to blame obesity on the modern food environment, epidemics of obesity, you know, simple question to ask is can we find epidemics of obesity without this modern food environment? I mean, that's the sort of science one o one right? And it turns out that the world is following. The first one I found in the literature was in 1902 in a population of the Pima native American tribes, pm and living in Arizona and observers saying, these people are poor, they're malnourished, they're suffering through famines, they've been suffering through a famine for 40 years and famines.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       It's hard to overeat during a famine. And yet the women of the tribe who do virtually all the work that they were treated as pack animals and effect, we're obese. So now we can disassociate obesity from the modern food environment and we could disassociated from, uh, this ultra processed foods we eat and start to ask the question, what is it about, can we find what might have driven obesity in that population despite the existence of famine? So it's from very simple observation. Once we get into these kinds of studies, say this in human genome studies, say that, um, I actually rarely do that in my books because you can find studies that will say anything and you'll see in the studies, um, people misinterpreting them. What was the cause of the population of women to be obese? Well. So one of the thing that happened during the Vint beginning in the 1860s, the PMO were put on a reservoir.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       They moved on to reds or they were reservation eyes whenever the verb form would be. And they began eating western foods. And back then it was sugar flour and lard for the most part and sugary beverages probably. So that's a reasonable hypothesis. And you could find the same thing. And the Sioux native American sue population living on a reservation in 1928 where you had uh, oh both obese men and women living with malnourished, stunted children who clearly wouldn't getting enough diet, but they were on a reservation, they were getting western foods. So ultimately the question you ask in science determines the answer you get. So the question I was asking is we have this observation that any population that transitions to western diet or western diet and lifestyle gets obese and diabetic, they, they develop what's called Metabolic Syndrome, which is insulin resistance and all these issues.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       And we know that's true all over the world. From the [inaudible] to the Pima to south Pacific islanders, to Africans, to European. So the genetics aren't that important. The question is what's triggering it in the environment and against Stephan would say, well there's too much food available and it's too palatable and we can't say no. And I had a lot of problems with the, we can say no part cause if we're lean it means that they can't say no and they being the people with obesity and I don't believe that's true. And then, or is it some specific item or some specific group in this, these foods that travel with western populations and so the exists the ability and today if you look up a dual burden of obesity and malnutrition, I have a Dropbox folder I could share with you. There's probably 50 studies all over the world.

Speaker 3:          00:50:21       You see the same observation, incredibly poor populations, malnourished. The children are stunted, which they're protein deficient in their calorie deficient and often the mothers are, the ants are obesity. Obesity tends to run in the females, which suggests it has a female sex hormone related effect. Fact that I don't believe works in the brain because we're dealing with populations that could not have overeaten if they could have overeaten why are the kids starving? That's sort of the question and this was the first thing that I think we swapped about back then, and it's still, if you can find populations with obesity epidemics, but without the modern food system, without Snackwells and without Lay's potato chips. Um, and if you know that they're going through a famine or you know that the kids at least aren't getting a food, how do you explain obesity and the mothers without assuming that the mothers are overheating? Let's pause right there. Stefan, is there a population of people that are obese that are not eating a western diet? They're not eating sugary foods,

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       um, that are obese and that are not eating sugary foods? Probably not. Because generally once you have an industrialized food system that's going to include sugar, but there are populations that eat a lot of sugar and are not obese. And we should talk about some of these actual, let's, let's about the, go back to the, yeah, sure. Let's talk about the Pima first. Um, now Gary has told his story. He's told his version of the Pima story. Let me tell the story, the version of the story that appears in the scientific literature. Now, the Pima, um, originally they were agriculturalists. They were eating traditionally a very high carbohydrate diet based on unrefined carbohydrates. Originally it was corn, beans and squash. Primarily they were hunter gatherers, agriculture. They were primarily Gary. Okay. They were primarily eating agricultural foods. They were also collecting some wild foods. That's correct.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       Um, they were fishing and eating the skeet pods. Primarily agricultural and data are very clear on that, Gary. So, no, no, no. Yes, they are. Look, we have data. You can't say things like that to happen because we're going to die. Well, let's, let's, let's move on. You think they mostly fish? That's incorrect. Okay. According to the data, I remember you saying that in your book. Something to that effect. Read Book. You've got my book. Anyway, let's, let's go on. We don't, that's fine. I'm going to move on here. Um, now the Pima traditionally were agriculturalists and Wa. What happened basically is you had all these farmers moving into their area, settlers of European descent, and they diverted the water from their river, the Gila or healer river, if you alone for now Hilo. And so they were no longer able to grow their crops, their agricultural crops that they were primarily dependent on.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       And therefore the government started providing them with foods to eat. And these were calorie dense refined foods. They were like Gary said, uh, flour, lard and sugar. And then they became very obese. Now there was a population of Pima right across the border from them in Mexico, also very similar culturally and all that, that maintain their traditional high carbohydrate lifestyle and agricultural lifestyle. And there've been studies comparing those two populations and the ones across the border with their traditional lifestyle or a lot leaner and healthier, not surprisingly than the ones eating lard, flour and sugar. Okay. But Gary, uh, you seem to believe that people can gain weight. You kept referring to famines and things. You seem to believe that people can gain weight even if they are eating very few calories. And you have referred to this many times in your writing. Um, and you know, these are very casual observations that you're making kind of these casual correlations and storytelling.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       But if you actually look at the data on this, what you see is that if you just measure calorie intake in people who have obesity, it is 20 to 35% higher than people who are lean after correcting for height, physical activity level. Um, and that I've got the references we're getting, we're getting a little bit into that means here, but let me give you an exuberance number seven, can I pause you guys right here? These people, they have essentially the same lineage. One group lives in Mexico. They, they're not eating these sugary foods and this western diet, the ones that live in America are the ones that live in America are becoming obese. The ones that live in Mexico or not. Is that correct? Correct. Yeah. And so now if you have someone with obesity, like I've said, the most accurate measures that we have suggest that they habitually consume and expend more calories.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       And now Gary's model says that that is downstream of the fattening effect. It's not causing the fattening effect. It is a result of the fattening effect. Whereas my model says that that is actually required for the fattening effects to occur. It has upstream. So now what happens? What happens here? What happens if you reduce their calorie intake by that same amount, 20 to 35%. It doesn't matter if you do it by restricting carbs or fat. These experiments have been done. They lose weight when you restrict their calorie intake down to that. This is the argument what you're saying that you keep consuming low amounts of calories but high amounts of sugar does. It doesn't make sense. You can get obese that way. Um, when you're saying it's a calorie, yeah, correct. And that's referenced number nine and 10. Um, to support what I just said and I want to talk about another one that really can we out on stuff. That's what, what I, the reason

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       I was using the dual burden example is because we have to explain how those women reading all those calories. Usually women, again, it's just often it was in trough in these studies were done by diabetes researchers who were studying diabetes in these populations and the men had high levels of diabetes in the women had to high levels of obesity. Um, to give you an example where that measurement was done in Trinidad in the 1960s and again, all I'm doing, this is the role I played as I asked the question, can you find populations that don't have a lot of food? Okay. You could say that the obese expend a lot of energy and they ate a lot of calories. The question is can they get obese without a lot of food? And so can we find populations like us? Can you find a population that gets obese without sugar?

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       Which was exactly the question to ask. So in Trinidad, in the 1960s as a malnutrition crisis, the u s government sends a team of researchers down to study this and the researchers come back and say, yeah, there's malnutrition, there's stunting, there's deficiency diseases. And two thirds of the adult women are obese and this is a medical problem. And the next year and MIT nutritionists goes down to do exactly what Stephan s four and to actually measure the diets and obese women and lean women and to study it. And this is the population, whether it's, it's unlike, I mean this is a very poor Trinidad and population and reports that they, I think it was 1800 calories a day with the obese woman reading was actually a little less than what the lean people seem to be eating and that it was lower than what the Food and Agriculture Organization considered for a healthy diet.

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       So again, what my role in this is to point out when you have populations like that, I don't see how the overeating hypothesis tells me the brain is in control of how much they eat tells me anything about why the women were obese, especially when their kids are starving. This is the paradox of the stool burden. An obese mother with a starving child, if there'll be some other, has to eat superfluids calories to get fat. Why hasn't she given those calories to our kids? Because she doesn't need him. She clearly doesn't need them. She's got fuel, so what's going on there? If you posit a hypothesis as I did, which says that the obesity is triggered by the macronutrient content of the Diet, then you can explain. I mean there are plenty of animal models. A famous quote I use in my books from John my year, it was like the fame leading Harvard nutritionists who studied an ob strain of animals in the 50s he said, my animals will get fat. Even when half starved, they will make fat out of their food. Even when half starved is are generally animals with mutations in the Leptin. It doesn't, whatever gene, whatever gene it is. It's kind of the question is if Mike, I can make fat out of my food at levels of caloric levels at for instance, a lean person can't, then I'm going to get fat eating the

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       same amount and that fat accumulation is going to be, you know means I'm taking in more calories and I expand. But the point is I'm for some metabolic hormonal reason, I'm taking the fuel I eat and turning it into fat and storing it in the fat tissue. What does your responses? Yeah, so my response is that if you want the best answers, you have to use the best methods to answer it, to answer the questions. Okay. Do you want a question answered properly? You have to use accurate methods to answer that question. Now, as you know, Gary, it's very difficult to measure food intake and free living individuals. Particularly you're traveling to a country you've never been to before. It's very difficult to get accurate measures. So just because some guy went to Trinidad and claim woman actual, okay, fine. Just because some woman went to Trinidad and claimed that people were eating 1800 calories and becoming obese does not mean that that's what actually happened.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       Now, let me, no, no, no, no. Gary, I'm responding now. We have studies where researchers used accurate measures to measure calorie intake in people who had obesity. Many of these people were saying, we're only eating 1200 calories a day. When they actually measured their calorie intake. What they found was that they were consistently eating more calories than lean people. So this, this phenomenon that Gary describes is something that is only observed when inferior methods are used to measure calories. The reason I'm using these populations, like I said, I'm just giving you an observation. Ob smaller with a starving child, the dual burden of malnutrition, obesity. This isn't one observation, it's not one nutritionist. The existence of the starving children strongly suggests that there's not a lot of food available and we have to explain obesity in the model. You know, I would like you to respond.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       Okay, fine. I will respond to that. Now look, I haven't looked at these studies in particular. I brought them up eight years ago. We got in a fight about it [inaudible] years ago. It ruined our, you know, it's like are we used to be by. So now look, um, there are many reasons why a child could be malnourished in a nonindustrial situation. And this is, I do a lot of work related to this and what you see in nonindustrial situations, you see a lot of infectious disease. You see a lot of um, malnutrition. So people not getting enough essential minerals and vitamins not getting enough protein. And you see a lot of children who are just barely hanging on because of this collection of really bad stuff that's happening in their lives. And so sites, things. Yeah, yeah. Parasites, malaria. I Dunno if there's malaria and Trinidad or not, but I mean all the diarrhea, pneumonia, these are the things that we all had before.

Speaker 1:          01:02:14       We had modern medicine and great sanitation. And then the country like the United States, 30% of kids didn't even make it past childhood. And so there's a lot of things that could have caused that. Gary. It's not necessarily because, you know, it's not necessarily the reason that you attribute it to now. I'm not attributing it to a reason. I'm just asking. Okay, well great. Well, I, I don't have the explanation, but I'm throwing out possibilities that are alternative to the one that you're implying is quite possible. Okay. So now, um, I, so again, when you use accurate measures of calorie intake, you find that these people with magical metabolisms who have obesity and don't eat very much seem to not exist anymore. Um, and furthermore, I want to, I want to get to us to another type of study that's really going to differentiate between this metabolic effect driven by insulin and the effect of calories.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       So we have a lot of studies that compared diets in which calories were the same but carbohydrate and fat intake deferred. And the ones that I really want to focus on right now that I think are key here are this studies where they increased calorie intake. So they fed people, they f one study in particular. And um, let's see, I'm going to give you a number here. Um, let me see if I can give you a number here. Sorry. Why don't you look at that. Um, can we, uh, bring up another issue because what we're talking about ultimately is why people get fat. Okay. I don't, I don't want to divert here. I'm in the middle of something. So, um, now if we want to understand why people get fat, we can look at studies that overfed people on fat or carbohydrate exclusively. So this one study, um, the first one that I want to talk about first, they figured out people's baseline calorie intake, figure out how many calories they need to just to maintain.

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       And then they increase that by 50% by exclusively giving them fat or exclusively giving them carbohydrate. Okay, study was, this is Horton. Okay. Um, give me a yes, a number 16, number 16. So, um, now if Gary's hypothesis is correct, these people should have gained body fat on the carbohydrate overfeeding but not the fat overfeeding because that increases your insulin, it has these effects on your fat cells, et Cetera. Okay. Now these were very rigorous studies. I want to emphasize that they monitor the, the actual Khoury's that got correct. Yes, they were. They were good. They had a baseline. They use prisoners and they per month state prison. No, that's incorrect. This is a different study. So they, they had a baseline. And did they require them to maintain the same dye and then add additional fat or additional carbohydrates? Yes. So same guy, same food, and then they just bump it up with fat, with carbohydrate, Horton. It wasn't Sims, it was anything stems. Well which talking the monkey, that was

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       which study did you do that was not prisoners? What was the, uh, he didn't have a metabolic, you know what? Let me just finish describing the study and we can, Gary, that's an irrelevant detail. Okay. What's relevant is that you just implied that I don't know what I'm talking about, Harry. You know what? I don't actually know. Maybe it was in prison. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. Now. Um, but it was not the Sims overfeeding study that was done in prison. That's what I know. Okay. Okay. So what's the reference? Yeah, it's on my website. You can go to my website, Stephan, dna.com and it's referenced number 16 and they're both there. Okay. So this was what's called a metabolic ward study where these people were in a research facility where the researchers could monitor and control every morsel of food. So there was no cheating, no inaccuracy.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       And they were measuring changes in body fatness using a gold standard method called underwater weighing. Okay. And so what they found was that at the end of a two week period of over feeding the carb and the fat groups gained the exact same amount of body fat, exact same amount of body fat. There was another second study that did the same thing and found the same result. Independent lab group, very similar experiment. Three week long instead of two weeks, they found the exact same thing, same amount of fat gain, different insulin responses, different amounts of carbohydrate in that exact same amount of fat gain. So this demonstrates that insulin is not, and carbs are not what controls what gets fat into fat tissue. Calorie intake is what controls that. So let me explain it again. Remember I talked about the paradigm you work in determines the question you ask.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       And this experiment is a classic example because they assume that people get fat by overfeeding. So then they say if we overfeed them, we've just doing what happens naturally. Everything about the experiment is based on the assumption that they're supposed to be testing, which is Ken. People get fat by overfeed it. And so the, from the Berry conception of the experiment they've built in the paradigm that we want to test the hypothesis, I'm on top of it. If it's a typical sims experiment, I actually wasn't familiar with this one. Oh it was a, it wasn't sims was a James. Oh Jc Peter. James Hill was funded for the, from about 1998 to about 2008 by proctor and gamble cause he was in a less Stra shill. I hate to say that Jim, I apologize, but I think it's a fair assessment. And then when he stopped being funded by proctor and gamble, he was funded by the sugar industry.

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       He's and JC Peters was the head of the Procter and gamble, Leicester, Leicester, which is now something that no one eats. Yeah, Lester was a fat substituted. It problem was you'd got like run out shit like that but the whole idea of a Lustra was to replace fat in the Diet. So every study hoe and Peters did implicated dietary fat as a cause of obesity. I don't think we could ever use, I hate to say it, I'm typically I, I don't think funding influences results but I wouldn't use it. James Hill study to make that point that because you think it's a biased study that was in everything. Everything Helen Peters did and one knows. I mean I talked about this in good calories, bad calories when they reported their results. Actually I did a foyer on James Hill cause he works for the University of Colorado. You could actually get, I got all his documents back and forth between him and the Lester.

Speaker 3:          01:08:54       I'd be happy to share them with you if you'd like there. Rebel at, I mean him and proctor and gamble but he basically held Procter and gamble for ransom. He would get a $500,000 unrestricted gift and then he would do a study and then he would ask and it would conclude that fat is bad and carbs are good and therefore a Lester as a viable product. Then he would ask for proctor and gamble for more money before he then published study. So it's a particularly egregious example of someone who's, I suspect it was just a belief system. He believed dietary fat, what's bad fat causes obesity. Uh, Lester is a good thing because you eat that instead of fat and you don't absorb it. And then every study he did confirm that. Um, the point that we keep getting away from that I haven't had an opportunity to, um, and Stephanie knows this as well as I do.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       If you're gaining say four pounds a year of fat or let's say between 20 and 40, you've put on 40 extra pounds. So now you're obese, you're nice, lean, healthy young guy in 20, like many of us were. And by the time you're 40, you've got 40 pounds of excess fat. That's the equivalent of putting in about a 10 calories is had storing about 10 calories a day into your fat tissue that you don't burn a metabolized. So you eat, say 2,700 calories a day, half carbs, you know, 35% fat, 15% protein, and 10 calories that they get trapped in your fat tissue, less than a bytes worth the food less than a sips worth of beer. So the question we're actually trying to ask is our answer, and this is again just my approach as a curious journalists too with a science background. This, how do we explain those 10 calories?

Speaker 3:          01:10:45       Because when we talk about those obese women with starving children, all those obese women were doing was storing 10 or 20 calories a day depending on how quickly they became obese. And those populations that tends to happen quickly in their 20s. Um, so we're asking this question, how do we, if you've got a situation where we have to end up with 10 calories stuck in the fat cells every day, that's 2030, 40 billion fat cells. So it's divided up very small. And is the brain somehow regulating that or again, is her a dysregulation in the body involving pick your hormones, pick your enzymes when the one, um, that somehow traps fat in the fat cells or prevents the fat from being used for fuel when it's released from the fat cells. And so if you think about it that way, like you let yourself go to seeds today, Joe Rogan decides I'm done.

Speaker 3:          01:11:43       I'm going to do nothing but drink beer. And you might start drinking five beers a day and over the course of 10 years you get 20 pounds. And it's all here. That 20 pounds over the course of 10 years is still only about 20 calories. You might've added 800 calories of beer to your diet and stored 20 calories as fat. How does that happen and why does it go here and not elsewhere? And as Stephen said, this is insulin dependent fat tissue. Um, so those are, that's one we're talking about this like this question, could somebody get fat during a famine or can they stay fat during a fam? And all they have to do is hold on to 10 calories a day extra. If they're only eating 1,210 gets stuck in their fat cells, 1,190 is excrete it or are expended. It's not that hard to imagine. And there's nothing in the laws of physics. It says it. So what could be dysregulated about their fat cells even during a relative fam and not a complete fem and but a relative fem. And that might be, and again, an animal experiments of which there are probably hundreds by now, different animal models. You can disassociate obesity from hype, from eating too much in the animals. Can I pause you for a second? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       So essentially you're saying that even if someone is taking in, uh, a good amount of cowers at the s the s a smart amount of calories, 2000 calories a day, if you're taking in these calories in the form of sugar, your body is going to take a certain percentage of them, even if you're getting enough food and stored as fat. Whereas if you were taking in just protein and vegetables and things along those lines, your body would not do that well. So this is a gets to the mechanism question and the evidence question but you're saying that right? So you're saying that if two people were on the same diet, one of them's on 2000 calories of chicken and fish and vegetables and the other one is on 2000 calories of milkshakes and you know sugary drinks and pasta and bullshit that that person is going to gain a certain amount of calories and just put them to fat. Right. Regardless that yeah, that [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:14:02       this being a science, that hypothesis can be tested and Stephan, thanks. It's been tested 80 times. Stephanie, it's, they've done a bad job of testing it and we will both tend to reject the studies that we don't like when we define don't light by whether or not they got the answer. We think

Speaker 1:          01:14:22       your perspective is that this is not the case. Your perspective is that like as you were saying in this study with a closely monitored these people's diets and the added additional fat and had an additional carbohydrates that they both gained the same additional amount of what it's right. I mean if cases isn't shot, this is correct. You have to see different levels of fat gain. I mean a short term study that did was how short term was it a two in three weeks. That's very short. Yeah, it is very short term. But Still Gary says that insulin is the thing that gets fat in fat cells and that, I mean you would see some kind of difference. It insulin made any difference but you should've seen some kind of effect, right? Some kind of difference in fact game.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       Um, I don't want to start taking out charts, but this gets into insulin dynamics that was worked out so over, uh, um, I promised I wasn't going to say oil boy. Why on the show, but it's my thanks to my Brooklyn born mother. It's my programmed in. Um, and a the same is true. A lot of these overfeeding experiments do the same thing. So when they talk about over feeding, they, they, they literally over feed. So they kind of do a reasonable way of figuring out which reading is Stephen. They measured, uh, they calculated how much energy they needed to stay in energy and balance. And again, right there, that's a problem because one of the hypotheses says that the energy balance is dependent on the macronutrient content of the food. So you're going to get a different different level depending on what the macronutrient content is and then different level of, of what what's necessary for energy balance.

Speaker 3:          01:16:06       So the classic example is a study that's my not for profit funded, that's been very controversial where they got their subjects, this is David Ludwig and get rambling. And there their colleagues at that, that Harvard and Boston Children's Hospital and they did this study in Framingham and they, they basically got, uh, subjects to lose 10 or 12% of their body weight and then they randomized them to three different diets have three different macronutrient composition. Then they basically calculated their energy expenditure on the three different diets, which is kind of exactly what we're talking about because if you want to be an energy balance, who know, you feed people exactly what they're expanding. And in that study, which was published a year ago, and they saw different levels of energy expenditure depending on the carbohydrate content of the Diet. So the higher level of carbohydrates, this is trying to keep them in energy balance.

Speaker 3:          01:17:08       The, the higher the carbohydrate, the lower the energy expenditure, the lower the carbohydrate, the higher the energy expenditure. So again, it's just whether or not they did the study, right? Who knows. Science is a compilation of a lot of studies and we're trying to, you know, address exactly this point, but merely building that into the experiment, we know what their energy expenditure should be. And then the point is when you increase in part, again, part of the trick of doing science, it's to say, look, we have competing hypotheses, uh, multiple hypotheses. And it's vitally important that you always keep the multiple hypotheses in mind when you're interpreting the study. So one hypothesis says it's how much they eat and another hypothesis says it's what they eat and that what they eat is, is moderated primarily through insulin. And when you do these experiments at the experiment that, that uh, Steve, so Steven is talking about Stephan, um, I'm completely confused.

Speaker 3:          01:18:12       Uh, if you overfeed them, you start out with a 50% carb diet. Now you overfeed them. If there's a threshold effect on insulin, which turns out there is, then you're just moving them. And when you're looking at insulin dynamics, when insulin is below a very low point, the fat cells will mobilize fat and the lean tissue, we'll burn it for fuel. And above that point you get pretty much flat. So if you start people who are eating 1500 calories from carbs and you add them, bump them up to 2,500 calories from carbs are still in the plateau side of the incident, you wouldn't necessarily expect to see any difference. The only way you expect to see a difference. And that's why it helps to really interrogate both hypotheses so that you know when you're doing the experiment, whether or not you're actually testing something, you one hypothesis, you want to set up the experiments with a hypothesis predicts the two hypotheses.

Speaker 3:          01:19:08       Predict something entirely different. This experiment, arguably the two hypotheses predict the same thing. You'll get fat gain because insulin is elevated regardless, and when insulin is elevated, you're going to get fat gain. The question comes back to this again, always fight on to keep this in mind. We want to what could possibly cause at 10 or 20 calorie excess that causes fat storage. I have a friend that was for 400 pounds when he was 18. It was a tall kid, about six foot five. Um, he was, uh, say 200 pounds over weight, 200 pounds overweight is roughly a hundred excess calories over 18 years stored in your fat cells. That's, you know, even if you assume that you have to consume 300 calories to have 100 excess stored in your fat cells, that's, you know, one to Coca Cola is a day that he was drinking or one half a quarter pounder or a day that he was eating. And that is lean friends warrant.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       And the question would be, why can't you just stop doing that? And again, Stephan would say, cause there's brain won't let him and I would say because his insulin is elevated, it doesn't matter whether he stops it or not, he's got into your Tressie underlying mechanism. Okay. Um, all right, so now again, it's easy to tell stories. It's not easy to tell stories that are supported by scientific evidence. Now, um, I want to bring people's attention to reference number 11 on my site. There have been 29 studies now that have measured differences in energy expenditure, metabolic for Kevin Hall study met analysis, correct. There've been 29 studies to date that I've measured calorie expenditure, metabolic rate on diets differing in carbohydrate and fat content. And when you put all those studies together, when you are at least the first 28 together and you look at what the overall literature says, it makes almost no difference to metabolic rate whether people are eating carbohydrate or fat.

Speaker 1:          01:21:13       And in fact this very small difference that it does make actually favors high carbohydrate diets. So you get a slightly higher metabolic rate when the Diet is predominantly carbohydrate. Now this study that Gary's side is the one study out of these 29 that has reported a larger effect than any others of carbohydrate restriction on energy expenditure. So this study reported and affect bigger than any of these other 28 and different. Sweet, thank you. Um, and, and interestingly, if you actually look at the data and these data have been Rhea analyzed by a researcher named Kevin Hall. And if you look at the data, you find that some of the participants, some of the data that represent some of these participants are literally physically impossible. They break the first law of thermodynamics. This is the conservation of energy. Gary knows about this. He has a physics background and they literally don't add up.

Speaker 1:          01:22:15       And when you start subtracting the, the clearly erroneous data from the pool of subjects, this big effect size starts to shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink until after you've gotten rid of all of it. This study does no longer, no longer reports a higher energy expenditure on a very low carbohydrate diet and it's consistent with the previous 28 studies that were done. So that's my perspective on that. But I want to go back to this [inaudible] you taught her a long time and I'm going to talk for as long as I want. Now I want to, I want to talk about human energy metabolism in this idea of the 10 extra calories a day. Gary, I, I really continue to get the feeling that you do not understand human energetics, um, because that's not how it works. But no, just saying 10 calories stored in the fat tissue, 10 calories and say anything about how much you have to eat. I'm not done. Okay. No, but you're in me. Sorry. You got to stop doing that dude. Keep acting like you think I'm an idiot. All right. Are you done now? Are you done? Can we be clear that we're talking about you done now? Can I just finish this until I'm dying? Without Gary, you had time to respond. You can respond, write down notes on what you want to respond to and after he's done, you can tell him, but we're going to get into a long course on something that's not the point. Fine.

Speaker 1:          01:23:40       Thank you. Okay, now what you see, there's basically two things you need to pay attention to here in terms of energetics. One is the imbalance between intake and expenditure, and that is very small, so it only takes a little bit of extra calories to cause somebody to start gaining fat. However, as they gain fat, their bodies get bigger. They're gaining fat and lean mass. People with obesity have more fat and more lean mass and their calorie needs go up and up and up and up. The larger their bodies get. And so even though the imbalance between energy and taking expenditure is small, their calorie needs end up being quite a bit higher. So I pause for a second. Yeah. So you're saying that someone just gaining calories, eating additional calories, their body gains lean mass as well? That's correct. How does the brain regulate that?

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       I didn't say it regulated by the dog. Hold on. That's so fascinating. How does the play muscle muscle, they're gaining muscle to some of his muscles. Some of it's because it's because they're carrying around this extra weight and so the extra calories and then on top of that carrying around the extra weight forces your body to grow larger. Presumably I'm, I'm actually not sure what the mechanism is, but it doesn't have anything to do with the brain. I don't know what causes it. That's what I'm saying, Gary. Okay. Now, um, so, so, but the point is by the time the person has obesity, they are consuming 20 to 35% more calories than they were when they were lean. So that's not just a one or two cokes a day. That is allowing them to remain obese. They are consuming 20 to 35% more calories. That is with the most accurate studies are saying.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       And so it's not just 10 extra calories or maybe just one or two cokes. We're talking about a substantial amount of extra calories. And isn't this a generalization because we don't know what I mean? What's the ratio of how much fat people get, how much weight people are gaining. Everybody gains a different amount of weight. And you're saying they're eating 20 to 30% more cowers like who is like how many people, how much are they gaining? Or people get fat, they get 20 pounds overweight. People get fat, they get a hundred pounds overweight. They'd be a that's right. Yeah. And that's why I give a range because what you see is that people who are overweight, so they're in the overweight range, you just have some extra fat. They eat about 10% extra calories. People who have a little bit of obesity eat about 20% extra calories.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       People who have, who are very, have very, very great obesity, eat more like 35%. So it tracks with the amount, I'm sorry, is it possible what he was saying that if you do consume 10 extra calories over long periods of time, that will accumulate extra calories cumulate like pen diamonds going into this. So how much do you have to DePaul? It is correct. It is correct that if every day you eat 10 calories more than what you need, then yes. Or your body or your body stores. Yeah. I will say that if your body is storing 10%, 10, 10 extra calories over top of what you need, but the thing is that as you get bigger, what you need goes up and up and up because you're carrying around more correct. And so it's 10% and Tenex or cow it, sorry, not percent. It's 10 extra calories on top of the elevated amount that you're already eating.

Speaker 1:          01:27:07       So you end up with these big differences in calories tick. So that's how, that's how it really works. But I want to talk about, um, some interesting observations because Gary, you like to talk about, um, you know, what's going on in different dietary trends and different cultures. And I find that pretty interesting too. I want to talk about the fact that sugar intake in the United States has been declining for the last 20 years. So it peaked in 1999 and it is currently, depending on which source of evidence you believe, 15 to 23% lower than it was in 1999. This has been corroborated by a number of different sources of evidence. This is number 17 on my blog. And of course we know that obesity has increased. Diabetes has increased substantially over the last 20 years in the percentage of the population are actually numbers percentage.

Speaker 1:          01:28:01       Yeah. And uh, and UK sugar intake has been declining for 50 years. I don't believe that. Okay, well, you can argue with the data. They're a number 17 and my blog there are about 22% lower. And this is what we see across a number of different, uh, industrialized countries. You see a stagnation or decline and sugar intake in recent decades as obesity rates are continuing to increase. And of course that 50 year period that covers the decline in the UK covers the entire UK obesity and diabetes epidemics. Um, but there's another one I want to talk about that and I respond to that. Yeah, we should probably look sponsor Stephan, actually I'll let you respond for me because we had this debate with the Keto Foundation. So you know my art counterargument, you want to give it? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. I mean are you sure you want to let me give it though, am I correct that? Okay. All right. So your counter argument is that the amount of that we consumed

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       20 years ago or even maybe 50 years ago, maybe continuing to fatten us today and it's about the sugar that we used to eat 20 or 50 years ago and not necessarily about the sugar we eat today. Well it's not exactly right. Okay. I get, the argument I made was because he brought this up when we've had to do a written debate on the Keto Foundation website. And it's interesting if you think about use tobaccos and example. So tobacco smoking per capita smoking in America peaked in 1965 right up to the surgeon general's report and it took 30 years before lung cancer rates turned over. Okay. And I think we both agree that cigarettes are a major cause of lung cancer smoking. So what you basically have is a system in which, if there are any, there's the assumption that Stephanie is making when he quotes this kind of data, is that the relationship between sugar and obesity is linear.

Speaker 3:          01:29:58       So it's sugar goes up, obesity and diabetes goes up, and if sugar turns over, they don't. So here's the thought experiment I used in Keto, which has 1965 or smoke in per capita, about 20 cigarettes a day. As it starts to come down, imagine we only cut that to 17 cigarettes or 16 cigarettes, a 20% reduction in smoking. Would you expect to see a reduction in the lung cancer rates? Again, this is the point I made about what you would expect to see rather than new things. Simplistic Metaphor. So the question is, would you like Joe, we go from 20 to 16. Do you expect to see the lung cancer rates turnover? No. No. And in sugar we went from drop a know you might, the derivative might drop. You might expect it to slow a tiny bit. Still use, there was a bunch of weird comparison because one of them was poisoned.

Speaker 3:          01:30:52       The other one's food, right? Well, but then this case, the food, the question is how toxic is the food? So in sugar, we have a variety in sugar. What happened is the equivalent of going from 20 cigarettes to 16 beginning in 1999 and Stephen is saying, I would expect to see an immediate change in obese. And in fact, if you actually look at the rates, the, the rate of increase in the prevalence appeared to plateau around six or seven years later. Uh, who knows whether that's relevant, but to get a small decrease in sugar 20 [inaudible], even if it's 20%, that's 20 to 16 cigarettes. And I'm saying the other factor that I talk about my book and stuff in those, this is very clearly have maternal transmission of the propensity to obesity and diabetes. So there's a generational effect. This and this is studies that were done in the same, on the same pm the same native American tribe where each generation if gets more and more, uh, susceptible to whatever it is in the Diet that's triggering and obesity and diabetes.

Speaker 3:          01:31:58       So that's been happening in the United States and around the world. You've got a generational effect that could last far longer, might even keep going indefinitely even if their sugar levels drop. So you have the sugar quick kicking off the obesity epidemic and yet it's Stephan's about to say this is a story and it is a story, but it's clearly the case that mothers who are obese during pregnancy or diabetic or gestationally diabetic, they become diabetic during pregnancy or they have metabolic syndrome, they're just a insulin resistant or they gain a lot of weight in pregnancy, will give birth to children who are at higher risk of becoming an obese and diabetic when they get older. And a younger age was in those children will pass it on. So again, we have, you know, I would be nice, I would love it if sugar consumption came down and with it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:48       Um, obesity and diabetes plummeted, but it's not a in any way reputation of this hypothesis, which I just want to state what it is because people get confused about it and we never got to it. The sugar hypothesis is a little different than what we've been talking about and it's pretty simple. We have obesity and diabetes epidemics worldwide as we talked to. It doesn't matter the genetics of the population. You add something about a western diet to those populations, western Diet and lifestyle, you get these explosions. Fifth epidemics of obesity and diabetes. And what I'm hypothesizing in this book is that sugar is a, something that has to be added. Maybe it's sugary beverages for all I know. Maybe or it could be, you know, a more complex hypothesis, a singer possible. One is you add sugar to any population to dye it in sufficient, whether it's southeast Asians living on Rice or the annual it living on reindeer and whatever, or the native Americans to the great plains or you know, Caucasians living in the upper east side of Manhattan, add enough sugar and eventually through the metabolic effects of the sugar and the generational effects, you will get explosions of obesity and diabetes and metabolic.

Speaker 3:          01:34:08       You want to respond to that? Sure. I mean, Gary, you called it man. It's always possible to tell a story to salvage your hypothesis, but that doesn't necessarily make the story correct. I mean, I can come up with a story that cosmic rays cause obesity by hitting my fat cells and making them fat. You can't disprove that. Nobody here can disprove that, but there's no evidence of an experiment to protect you from, okay. We don't have, we don't have the data right now. You don't have data supporting your hypothesis. No, we do. You're just dismissed. Can I get back to the camera? Let's let them respond them on Kevin Hall leader. Yeah. So, um, what do you think about what he's saying about sugar and increased rates of diabetes and that this is the cross? Yeah, I mean, so let me, it this way.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       We don't have any evidence supporting what he just said. So that is a story that is not supported by evidence. Now does it, does that mean that is definitely incorrect. No, I cannot say that. That's definitely incorrect. Same Way. I can't say it's definitely incorrect that cosmic rays cause obesity. But you know, I'm going to, I'm going to use it, Christopher Hitchens quote here that which is asserted without evidence does not require evidence to refute. And that's the way I feel about this particular story. Um, but you know, there are cultures that consume large amounts of sugar and do not develop obesity. We've talked about, and we're going to talk about it again right now. Um, so this is referenced number 21. I'm on my blog. I'm going to talk about three different cultures, one of which we have not talked about, Gary. The first one is the uh, the Hadza hunter gatherers of Tanzania.

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       This is a really interesting nonindustrial culture. They as part of their hunter gatherer diet, eat a lot of honey. Honey is a very common food among hunter gatherers living similarly to how our ancestors used to live. And if you measure there year round honey and take, it's about 15% of their calories. So this is a major calorie source for them. That's about as much sugar as the average American eats. And they eat fruit sugar on top of this. They eat a lot of fruit on top of that. And so they're eating quite a bit of sugar. And the Hadza men have about 12% body fat women have about 18. So they correspond pretty closely to our western ideals. What isn't that high for hunter gatherers? No, not really. I mean, that's higher than me. Uh, hang around. Bless me. Ask you this. How have you had your body fatness measured?

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       What amount? A measured a bunch of ways. Electricity. I've added this machine where you hold onto these things. Just stand on this platform and the physician's office of, okay, so I'm with calipers the most. Okay. So all the methods that you measure that you mentioned are not gold standard methods. So the gold standard methods are underwater weighing and the underwater weighing these people on this island. Uh, actually I'm not sure. I'm not sure how to bring that equipment to this island. Correct. But okay, look, um, I can tell you that you can look up photos. I don't remember how they, how they measured their body fat, but you can look, I am 12% as measured by Dexa. So I'll just tell you that so you can get a sense of what 12% is by Dexa. Um, which is a gold standard method. Um, so you can look at photos of these people. They're very fit. They're lean, they're not like ripped, you know, they're not Arnold Schwartz and Egger and peak form, but they are, I understand it, but it seems to correlate with a higher consumption of sugar that they seem to have a higher percentage of body fat than the average hunter gatherer. Now you look at a lot of the average a hundred gatherers, like a friend of mine does a lot of work with the pygmies and uh,

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       the Congo and they've very lean. Okay, so you see him sees packs.

Speaker 1:          01:38:00       That's the second culture. I was going to cite that Ethan kind of honey, do they? Yeah. If they're the same ones and little booty pygmies of the Congo, um, they eat up to 80% of their calories can come from honey during the rainy season. So they also eat a lot of honey and our lean not just leave the year. Correct. Yeah, it's for them. It's part of the year. The Hadza that you did more consistently and the Hadza have low levels of body fat. Their cardiovascular risk markers are excellent. They don't have diabetes. Same. But this is absolutely not like a controlled study in the consumption. Not, I absolutely agree with you. And that's exactly the point I'm trying to make is that when you have a culture that is eating a lot of sugar, but everything else is in place, they're doing everything else right. The sugar's not enough to make them fat.

Speaker 1:          01:38:50       It's not single handedly enough. I'm not saying it doesn't contribute. I think sugar does contribute. I just to be very clear, I think sugar does contribute to obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but it's not single handedly responsible as Gary has argued. So the third culture is pretty interesting. The Kuna of Panama and the reason they're interesting is that they actually aren't eating honey. They're actually eating white sugar. So there a culture that they live primarily a nonindustrial lifestyle. They're farmers and hunter gatherers and um, they, but they do a little bit of trade and one of the things they trade for us sugar and they eat sugar sweetened foods as well. So like donuts and pastries and they drink soda and Koolaid. What, what is their lifestyle in terms of like what do they have a natural lifestyle. They are a hunter gatherers and subsistence farmers. So they're, you know, living a physically active, natural lifestyle

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       problem and comparison with any westernized civilization that you burn off. Sold many more cow.

Speaker 1:          01:39:59       100% agree with you. And I think that is exactly the point. I'm trying to make is that it's more complicated than just sugar

Speaker 2:          01:40:06       is more complicated than that and just sugar, but with a normal lifestyle it may not be. This is I the consumption, the thing about burning of the calories is also the, the, the glucose demands a glycogen demands on the muscle. You're, you're, you're not just existing like the Wa, one of the problems with Western lifestyle is that many people are just existing. They're sitting in a chair, they're walking to a desk, they're sitting in their car, they're not doing anything to burn any of this shit off. So even if you have, like if you get a baseline of a minimal amount of calories that you require for the day, I think what Gary's getting at is that if you, if you have this lifestyle, the lifestyle that many of us have, and then with that lifestyle consume sugar that you're going to get fat. I don't think you can compare that to athletes.

Speaker 2:          01:40:58       And in that respect, I don't think you can compare that to a hunter gatherers because you're requiring, it is a much more significant load on your body. Like when I do this sober October fitness challenge with my friends during October and we, I was working out four hours a day and I was fucking eating everything that moved. I was drinking soda. I never drink soda. I was eating cookies. I didn't gain any weight other than muscle. I didn't get any fat at all. Yeah. And I was eating a terrible fucking die, but I was going crazy. When you're trying to stay alive and you're running around plowing and growing foods and hunting and gathering and fishing, you're burning off insane amounts of calories. Just the hiking that's required, the amount of exercise it's required. It's off the charts in comparison to standard western life.

Speaker 3:          01:41:50       We are on the same wavelength here. I mean, I completely agree with you that it is more complicated than just sugar. And, but if you read what Gary is written, and please correct me if I'm wrong here, Gary argues that sugar is the primary cause of obesity and that physical activity does not matter. Calorie intake. Does it not matter? Do you think the physical activity doesn't matter? Uh, I think it's a, uh, uh, no, I don't think it makes a hell of a lot of difference for fat when we're talking about the cause of obesity. I don't believe obese people get obese because they're suddenly, well let me put it this way.

Speaker 2:          01:42:24       So you take someone who's an elite athlete and they start consuming a lot of sugar, but they, they ramp up their exercise accordingly. Like say if someone does what I did during the sober October, they're working out three, four hours a day every day. You don't think that they have higher sugar demands that their body would just burn it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:45       I know, absolutely. I think that if there's a real benefit to exercise, it's burning off the carbohydrates you consume then and you need less insulin to do it. Can I respond to the Kona? Get back to them for a second. Okay. I mean one of the issues I have with Stephen as he writes off my stories, his stories, which they are all science began to stories on hypotheses. And then what you'd do is go look for the evidence and then he quotes studies and refers to what has happened. And this is somehow by calling it evidence that may, and then we had this discussion a year and a half ago and you didn't disagree with me at the time and it had no influence. So I'm just going to read from the email I wrote to second. It's creating emails. It's gotten to that point in the conversation at deed it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:33       Well, because it's, I'm not only going to read from the email if I have time, I'm going to read from your book read the Kuna. The study you cited is interesting. Okay. So this was a study that profess to measure sugar intake of this population on an island and the Gandhi and compare it to the population in Vera where they, uh, they had emigrated and I say, but there added sugar and take an alta according to figure one is 25 teaspoons per week, plus the equivalent of 24 ounces of Sodas at 78 grams. If it's coke 32 ounces of Koolaid, that's 96 grams, said I'm leaving out the cup of a sugar cane because I don't know what that has meant or how they assess it one way or the other. It's not processed sugar. So it's roughly 274 grams of sugar per week or about 32 pounds per year.

Speaker 3:          01:44:21       Now, that alone is very low intake and we don't know how it changed over the years. We have no idea if it's increasing recently or been low for years. So you just used the coon. That's an example of a population that eats a lot of sugar and stated at dogmatically, but that a lot of sugars, 32 pounds a year. And then I said, wait, hold on. I thought that's what I heard. Uh, if we believe the study, the Coonan Vera Cruz are consuming roughly the same amount, but I'm not sure. I believe the study when it comes to the Vera Cruz population, do you really think these urbanized coon are consuming only three, eight ounce sodas per week? So the implication was as population of Caribbean islanders immigrates to Vera Cruz, they move into the city and they consume more sugar back where they used to live because they trade for it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:05       Then when they get into the city, um, so five glasses of Koolaid, no candy, no ice cream, nothing. I'd like to know more about the urban CUNA before I accept such an analysis is valid on top of this. As they say, the analysis is done mostly of women because quote, the women were available to study because they were at home during the day on quote. So what were the men consuming and what were the children consuming when they weren't at home and was there something magical about this freak food frequency questionnaire and these researchers that they captured it accurately. So this is what scientists, you have studies, you have evidence in. The question always is you've got competing hypothesis. Does this evidence really speak to the hypothesis? And I'm one of my issues with Steven, it's what provoked aren't our initial discord is that he's constantly citing studies that don't actually, either they only speak to one hypothesis like the overfeeding study or they're poorly constructed and poorly done.

Speaker 3:          01:46:00       So even this hazed example with the honey is something we discussed an email very kindly and we went back and forth and I said, I don't actually think it's a reputation because the hypothesis I'm defending here, the case against sugar is you add sugar to any populations, native diet, and you get epidemics of obesity and diabetes. So here's a population that's been eating honey for maybe thousands of years. In fact, when they emigrated to this area, they may have added honey to their diet and had obesity and diabetes. Then in the Steven points out in the book, obesity and diabetes in a hunter gatherer populations, a death sentence for the child and for the mother who gives birth. So you're going to very quickly weed out anyone. So again, it just comes back to this question of does this actually does, is it a refutation? The hypothesis that I found a hunter gatherer or a population that eats a lot of honey and is in fat.

Speaker 3:          01:46:55       And the answer is I don't think so. Stephen thinks it does. You could flip a coin. All of this can be settled with experiments. One of the experiments we did it no city, uh, so one of the metabolic problems that goes along with obesity and diabetes is non alcoholic fatty liver disease. It's endemic. It used to be 20 years ago, if he had alcoholic fatty, if he had fatty liver disease, a Dr. Wood and you told the doctor you didn't smoke, they would assume you were lying. Now it's so common and so common in children and particularly common in Hispanic children. They a that it's clear it's not caused by alcohol. And the question is what causes it? Cause if you could create a fatty liver with the macronutrient, you could probably create insulin resistance as well. And then this whole slew of disorders including obesity and diabetes.

Speaker 3:          01:47:46       So my non for profit funded a pilot study where we just took 40 cared by the researchers at UC San Diego and at Emory university in Atlanta. It took 40 kids who had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and randomized them into two groups and one group. We gave them the entire family, all the food they need it so they could overeat to their heart's extent, but no added sugars in their diet and no sugary beverages. And this study was published in Jama four months ago and it's just it get rid of the sugar in the Diet. The fatty liver disease resolves, you know, it was pretty simple. I could tells you nothing about mechanism. The kids lost a little bit of weight. Maybe it was a weight loss. The conventional wisdom would be they just ate less, which I wouldn't be at all surprised because they probably didn't like the food as much without sugar in it.

Speaker 3:          01:48:38       But these are the kinds of ways you could test these hypotheses and problems I have with like the met analysis, getting back to Kevin and hall, there's two ways you could do science. You could say, let's look at all the junk that was done for 30 40, 50 years. Let's find everything we can. That even vaguely speaks to the experiment and ignore any quality of the study. So if it may be asked, it asks this question like we want to know what happens when people do this. But in doing this, we switched there, you know, fat intake around fat and carbon take around and then we can throw all that garbage into a Meta analysis. And the one thing I'm pretty competent as they did a poor job because of one study I looked up the one with the biggest effect they mistook Hila Jewel's for kilocalories. So they reported that 400 kilo calorie decrease in energy expenditure on the low fat diet and one was a 400 kilo joule, which is, what's that factor? You know, these numbers, uh, 0.8 0.18 or something. Several of the other studies where Jim Hill Studies, we've talked about Jim how biggest studies or Jen now and the way we approached it, the non-for-profits say you've got understand what the question is and you've got to design an experiment to get the right answer. So when Stephen Dismiss

Speaker 1:          01:49:59       this Harvard three names for him now, what Stephan's to fall his DNA, right? Dr Ghana, can I step to the named Stephanie? It's really easy to find. I can't do it. Do it. I just don't get names. My name's Joe. All right, Gary, that I know. I do the, um,

Speaker 3:          01:50:19       Stephan, uh, ultimately rejected this study is about a $12 million study that was done at Harvard based on Kevin Hall. So these are two names. It's about three people out there who are convinced that everything people like me are saying is wrong or not everything but most of it. And they keep coming up over and over again. And they would, so Kevin Hall claims that he has refuted the carbohydrate insulin model in his studies. So when a study comes out supporting it, he works to find out why that studies wrong. We all did the same thing. I did the same thing right here with the Kuna study explaining why I don't find it meaningful. But anyway, that's the thing. The goal was to do the right study cause ultimately you got to remember what's on the line here. We have obesity and diabetes epidemics. I mean tragic shit is going on out there. I mean people, you know, these are ruining lives. There are overwhelming the healthcare system. And the argument I made is that for the past 50 years, basically people have thought a lot like Stephan is thinking now Dr Dna and that there appears to be another story that could be true and when we have to do is find out if it is true because people are dying now.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       Stuff. Okay. Um, the first thing I want to say is that this alternative explanation that Gary is talking about has already been investigated intensively, including studies that were funded by his own organization, new c two out of the three studies that have been published on that. We're clear reputations on hypothesis and no, no, no. I'm gonna responded here. No, no. I know you've got to raise that the study, correct. Gary, Gary, Gary, I representing them according to your beliefs is not representing them correctly. Okay. Now I've noticed a remarkable correlation between studies undermining your beliefs and you thinking those studies are garbage and we should talk about, uh, Jim Hill and his studies a little bit because, you know, to me just saying this guy has a conflict of interest and then insinuating that that makes the study bad if you can't actually find a problem with the study itself.

Speaker 1:          01:52:30       These were very rigorous studies if you cannot point out, I see the problem with the study, it was designed with an assumption. It was designed based on the assumption it suppose it wasn't designed how Gary wanted it to be designed. Um, if you cannot find a problem with that study, then you can't just dismiss it by making these insinuations that the person had a conflict of interest. Okay. I now into the problem. Okay, that's great Gary. Now Harry on it at the time. All right. You're going to be able to respond in a moment. Now I'm the Cuna. I think we should really get back to this issue, this nonindustrial culture, because the primary basis for Gary's book, the case against sugar, the primary observation that underlies gears, belief on this is this observational correlational thing that cultures, when sugar gets into these cultures, they become fat and that is the common thread and in obesity, and so what I'm doing is I'm pointing out a culture where sugar came in and it did not make them fat and that's one of three cultures.

Speaker 1:          01:53:41       I haven't even looked that hard. Okay. These are just three cultures that I came across is probably a bunch more that are eating high levels of sugar, but they're 800 [inaudible] to our hobbies and I think a is the same. And again, Joe explanation is right on point. There's a lot of other things going on in these cultures and it's more complicated than just sugar. That's exactly my point. Now I want to talk about the Cuban economic crisis. This is reference number 22 from 1989 through 1995 the Cuban economy collapsed and the price of food went way up. The price of gasoline went way up. And so people started focusing on these really cheap foods. Cuba was a major sugar producer at the time. I don't know if they still are. And so the intake of sugar went way up. Intake of refined carbohydrate went way up.

Speaker 1:          01:54:34       The Diet became a 77% carbohydrate, primarily white rice and sugar, 28% sugar of their total calorie intake. So that's like double what Americans eat. Now their calorie intake went down and because of the lack of gasoline, people got really physically active because they had to walk everywhere. So now again, if this is, this is a situation where we can test Gary's hypothesis. If Gary is right and calories don't matter, only refined carbohydrate and sugar matter, obesity should have gone through the roof in this population over that period of time. What you actually see is that the prevalence of obesity declined by half. So there was a 50% decline. It went from 14% to 7% over the period of this. Um, increase in sugar intake, increase in refined carbohydrate intake. And you might think, well these people are just starving like crazy and that's why obesity rate went down.

Speaker 1:          01:55:35       Well, we actually have evidence on the rate of underweight as well. And so we can check on that. The rate of underweight increased only slightly, it went from 8% to 10%. And so we know these people weren't just totally starving. Um, and what happened then was as the Diet rebounded, as the economy rebounded in the diet rebounded and their diet shifted away from these refined carbohydrates and sugar and back to the normal diet that was higher in, uh, in fats and lower in carbohydrate, lower in sugar, the obesity rate went right back up as soon as they went back to their normal diet. And so I find this cause there were, there were not walking as much. Yeah, I was an exercise and also just their diet became richer again. I mean, if you're eating a diet that's a very poor diet, eating like white rice and sugar, I mean it, it's not like if that's most of what if, if you're sitting there and on your plate is a white rice and sugar, you're not going to be eating a ton of that and getting fat as opposed to eating a rich diet with more varied foods.

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       And so, um, this is a case where you have an entire country testing Gary's hypothesis and finding that basically the opposite of what his hypothesis predicts. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:56:50       Uh, let's go with the, the, the, when he was refuting the studies and you want to go, but this was a level of this course I don't even really want to get into because that's a study that I'm going to have to read. He's right. I'm gonna read it to try and figure out what the problem is. I remember looking at that study and thinking there wasn't the kind of day to your side and maybe there's multiple studies put together, but the one study I looked at, the kind of day two you're citing wasn't in there. That this is again a preferences are on my website. So have at it. No I will, but we'll be off the air by then. Um, the beginning of his, when he started talking, who's referencing some studies and you had a problem with that? Well there's this whole, it's a game.

Speaker 3:          01:57:29       People plan again, it's why basically in my book I try not to get into, he said she said studies cause you never know how well they did. I think we both agreed that there's a reproducibility crisis in science. It's some huge proportion of the studies are just raw on whether their experiments or observations. People sometimes aren't very good at what they do. Right. And so anyone in either business, you have to, Steven likes to say, I have no evidence, nothing dammit. But simultaneously people accuse me of writing a 600 page book with 150 pages of references. I was too long to read. So there's clearly evidence for this observation and this hypothesis. My issue with Stephan is had he speaks as though he knows what this authority and so again, I would like to just read a little bit from your book because as I was prepping for this, that was for you do that though. The, he was referencing Cuban situation. I don't know what the reality for that. Before that, when, when you first started talking, he was referencing things that you were stating that he was saying. What were you saying? That uh, th th th the, the organization that supports him actually refuted Jim Hill Studies,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       the Jim Hill, the, uh, the new c studies. And now we're talking about the nuisance, the first two of which, and we can get, we can get into detail on this, on how those refuted Gary's, uh, beliefs. And I would say Gary is about the only person who thinks that they did not refuse just beliefs. The scientific community is pretty unanimous, can respond. But could you please say what was, what would the study stayed on? Let me do it before he did the first study

Speaker 3:          01:59:09       as a pilot study. That uh, depends what you look at to depend whether or not it refuted your beliefs. So there again, you have to understand this world. There are researchers who believe one thing, Kevin Hall and Nih tends to believe that obesity is an energy balance problem and you people get fat because I ate too much. I hope I'm doing Kevin Justice. Um, and then there's David Ludwig and his colleagues at Harvard who tend to believe what I believe and we funded them both to do studies and Kevin Hall study. Uh, if you believe what Kevin, if you believe Kevin interpreted it correctly, uh, was not supportive of this model, that carbohydrates are ultimately driving insulin and insulin is driving up fat accumulation. And the David Ludwig Study, uh, reported the opposite. And, and David has criticized Kevin Study and Kevin has criticized David study. And this is the nature of science.

Speaker 3:          02:00:11       This is what you do in science. You do an experiment, people critique it. Ideally you do another one. Kevin has decided, well, Kevin is doing it. Another one, I think he's asking the wrong questions, but what I just saw the other day that he's doing another experiment. Um, today the middle study was a tree living diet study where a done by Christopher Gardner at Stanford University and the idea was a original idea was 600 people randomized to either a very low carbohydrate diet or a very low fat diet and we funded it in part because we hoped that Christopher would be able to get people to almost a ketogenic diet on that low carb side. And Dean Ornish who promotes a low fat diet always complained that the low fat diet, it wasn't fast enough so hopefully they'd be able to separate out these two. Um, at the end of the trial they got pretty lousy adherence.

Speaker 3:          02:01:10       A low carb was about 25 to 28% carb, which is by no means a low meaning, pretty typical, pretty typical in free living studies. And the low fat was about equal. Um, what they did, which it's funny, we've analyzed this on one side but not the other. Um, they told the low carb group not to eat sugars and refined grains, which are by my hypothesis the most fattening carbohydrates. And they also told the low fat group to Nati refined sugars and refined grains. So they basically removed the most fattening parts of the Diet from both arms of the study. It's funny, we knew that we're going to do with the low carb group cause you have to, and my colleagues actually knew they were going to do with the low fat group. I didn't know that. When I found out I was stunned because now you're testing two diets.

Speaker 3:          02:02:01       Neither one of them have sugar or white bread. So now you see similar weight loss with relatively poor compliance. Why would they do that? That doesn't make any sense with the argument. And we, we talked to Chris for a lot of his argument. He was afraid there were two things on, he wanted the Diet to be healthy. Okay. So a healthy diet in 2015 has become a diet that doesn't have sugar and white bread in it. So he wasn't going to promote sugar and white bread to one died or the nother, um, I take so long as the period of time where they're studying these people, they were on the die. They were supposed to be on the Diet for a year. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. So that's the question is again, would you expect to see a difference? I can send you an email I wrote to my new see colleagues in 2015 I could read it when I found out about this low fat thing saying this is insane.

Speaker 3:          02:02:51       He's removed. They both groups are carbohydrate restricted. So you could think of it as a low fat carbohydrate restricted diet and a high fat carbohydrate restricted diet. And then he kinda got the same answer, which could be for any reason whatsoever. There's a paper, uh, I don't know if I can, well, I'm not going to talk about, it's bad enough talking about ambiguous studies that have been published without getting into, on published research. But, so people see this, the New York Times, for instance, the two stories on it. One of them said it's not about calories. It's about the quality, the sugar in there, fine grain because both groups restricted sugar and refined grains and loss weight the other. And that was written by a reporter who tends to believe what we believe. And the other article said, it's all about the calories because both groups ended up on average eating 500 calories each at the end up.

Speaker 3:          02:03:42       From a scientific perspective being a poorly done study, even though we funded it, I'm not, it's just, it didn't answer the question. You said 500 calories each. 500 heritage valley strict Calvinist actually self reported. So it's not, so it's not particularly meaningful. So again, these are, I don't like using, it's a complicated study because it's low in sugar. Well and it's also free living. Yeah. So both sides are low in sugar. Both sides are not eating processed to full differences in total carbohydrate intake. Okay. So even though they were both not eating as much refined carbohydrate, they were still too full differences or greater over the period of that study in total carbohydrate into, if you believe the food frequency questionnaires that you just said, we don't know whether we have a, well you could be talking about vegetables, you could be talking about fruits.

Speaker 3:          02:04:34       Well these are healthy carbohydrates that they had primarily in this study. Can we right now we agree that that study can be interpreted from virtually any way you want it. Especially because it was a free living. You don't agree with that. Um, now, now what we will agree on, I'll agree with you on this, is that refined carbohydrates and sugar are the most fattening type of carbohydrate that we can agree on what God, we came to an agreement. But the question then the question is why is it because people eat too much of, here's the thing. If you, if you believe Gary hypothesis now, any kind of carbohydrate increases insulin levels. Some do it more than others are fine carbohydrates do it more. Any kind of carbohydrate increases insulin levels relative to fat. Okay. And so if that is true and these groups and that matters for fat loss, these groups had two full differences in carbohydrate intake.

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       Even though it was predominantly healthy carbs, you would just shoot a scene, something you shouldn't have seen the exact same amount of weight loss in these two groups. Right? Right. But they're not high in sugar, but present your argument is always there. Part of the argument, which is you take away the sugar and that was the problem with one of the problems with the ANA. Yeah. The argument I'm making and and stuff, it's completely right and I'm defending my hypothesis. Okay, I see a study that he does the same thing. He did it here. We all do it. You see a study that disagrees with you. You find the reason why I did not believe it in every study ever done has plenty of reasons not to do and not to believe it. That's why independent replication is something you always wanted to get another group to do the study.

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       Ideally a third group, people come in, they criticized the study, then you'd do it again and again and again. And so, you know what I was trying, when we, even when we started the nutrition science initiative, the choice stem is a nonprofit. The choice of the word initiative was to get nutrition researchers to an effect s stop using these garbage, poorly designed studies to come to conclusions because they like or dislike the interpretation, but try to get them to think the way harder scientists would and developing studies that it asks precisely the right question. And then the, so even the pilot study that was interpreted as not supporting this hypothesis, and again, you could argue that for an hour and nobody's going to care. That study was not randomized. So non randomized study, you can't infer causality. It's that's why it was a pilot study. One of the many reasons it was a pilot study.

Speaker 3:          02:07:04       The people who think this carbohydrate model. So I think when we talk about the carbohydrate incident model, it means carbohydrates are fattening. That's the basis of it. Bread, pasta, potato and sugar may be the, the thing that's necessary to add to the Diet to make all these carbs fat and then cause sugar. As we talked about this a year and a half ago, the fructose molecule is metabolized in the liver. It's linked to fat accumulation in the liver, which is linked to insulin. And I like the way you're squeezing your stomach fat while we're talking about that matter. I got to work out dude. Um, the uh, just boring, you know, for these experiments to be done right there, they have to be tested, right? Like you can't use pork poorly designed experiments of poorly, you know, and every experiment ever done. And so what we've tried to do is keep working towards better experiments.

Speaker 3:          02:07:59       There's now a new version of the Ludwick experiment being done at the Arnold Foundation. Laura and John Arnold funded to the tune of I think 13 bill million dollars and whatever that study fines Kevin Hall and we'll probably find the reason, look in it and find a reason to question. And ideally they would be working together so that you come up with the criticisms before you've spent $13 million, but this is how science works. My job was to tell a good story is Stephanie would say, and I believe people who read the books can judge whether they're too good. You know, am I convincing in arguing that the you add sugar to it, counter evidence to everything. There wasn't counter evidence and wouldn't require a journalist to come along in 20 whatever it is, 19 lip to make these arguments you this because this is something that you've admitted to something you said rather.

Speaker 3:          02:08:53       Why are sugary carbohydrates the most fattening? Well, if this hypothesis is correct, I think s you would say that they trigger our food reward or they are, wait, wait, let me just finish and I would say the counter argument is that they create a hormonal milieu in the body that that over responds to insulin and insulin. Well we haven't said is if you look in a textbook for fat metabolism and fatty and you know what causes fat storage, insulin is the hormone that primarily regulates fat storage. In your fat tail. So the idea is that you raise insulin and the sugar because of this path of it being fructose and that mostly being metabolized in the small intestine in the liver seems may indeed cause insulin resistance. And if it does you over respondents. And so one is a peripheral explanation, not that people don't love it and they don't want to, you know, over consume it, whatever that means. And the other is a central explanation.

Speaker 1:          02:09:59       Yeah. So I mean sugar is a factor that makes us want to eat foods, right? I mean this is one of the many food properties I would love to talk about this more. That caused dopamine release in the brain. And dopamine is a chemical that sets our motivational levels to do certain behaviors. So the reason we become addicted to drugs is that they go in the brain and they stimulate dopamine release and that reinforces drug seeking behaviors. Right? But this is just causing you to consume more. Correct. But you're saying that the actual amount, let's say if you have the same amount of carbohydrates are sugary carbohydrates versus the same amount that our vegetable, carbohydrates, it sugary carbohydrates are going to be more fattening? No, no, I didn't say it was independently of calories. It's still entirely dependent on calories. Yeah, correct. And we have randomized controlled trials, um, demonstrating that.

Speaker 1:          02:10:48       So if you look at the randomized there, by the way, we're not, uh, we're not operating in an evidence vacuum. There's tons of randomized controlled trials on sugar. These random, these randomized controlled studies, are they short term? Um, it depends. Well, it depends on how you define short term. They're not last time, years and years isn't the issue though. Longterm chronic effects like that seems to be possibly, but let me put it this way. You know, if you believe that insulin is the cause, the effect of insulin on fat cells happens almost immediately. So Insulin, I, I'm not aware of any mechanism of insulin on fat cells that takes more than a few hours to occur. And so if you believe that insulin causes obesity, this should be happening immediately. You shouldn't have to wait months and months for this to occur. No, that doesn't make any sense at all. No, it does make sense.

Speaker 1:          02:11:43       It makes sense. It makes sense. You eat, you eat. Does that make sense to you? Well, because again, he's, he's kind of making this up as he goes along. So the idea is we'll explain why it doesn't make sense without consulting us as possible. Has he not been insulting me ever? I might just buy us. I realized that I, it's everything is perspective but necessarily saying he's insulting your stories, not you personally, but what, what, what do you, what, why doesn't it make sense to you? Okay. So the idea is when your insulin is elevated, you're storing fat, right? Uh, it depends on what you mean by that. That's not, see you do a little bit of Bait and switch here. That's an intouch is to answer the question. If it's well, it depends. What do you mean by store? I mean your fat cells are accumulating fat when insulin is element.

Speaker 1:          02:12:35       Do you mean accumulate? Like, like next day you'll have to fat. It inhibits, uh, uh, yeah, that's incorrect. It stimulates lipid protein lipase and it inhibits hormone sensitive. We should, we should really talk about this because that's incorrect. It's in the textbook. No. Yeah. We'll talk about what's in the textbook. Don't worry Gary. They do says, um, okay so you don't believe it, but just give me your position and then I'll let him refute it. Uh, it's here but just say it. Just want to show it. Okay. Cause again, you're going to say it's not in here. So I have the same textbook and then we'll let Joe here. Suppression of Fat Mobilization by Insulin. And there's another graph that is a stimulation of fat mobilization. Congratulations to all of you people that are listening to this [inaudible] hanging in there. I know we're in the weird scientific, let me just say this is going to take a long time.

Speaker 1:          02:13:30       So we agree on the molecular mechanisms. Okay. We agree on the molecular mechanisms, the impact of insulin on enzymes and fat cells. What we disagree about is the implications of that. And I think that's what we should talk about. It's true because nowhere in that textbook does it say that insulin regulates the total size of body fat stores. Absolutely guarantee that is that is something that chemo have added onto that mechanism. Would you like to know conversation I have with the author of, no, not right now actually. So, um, the now the, now let me tell you about the conversation. Actually Gary, let me, and I should explain this for, we talked for three hours. Can you stop interrupting me please? Okay, now let me explain. So insulin essentially does have effects on enzymes that cause fat cells to take up more fat and to release less fat.

Speaker 1:          02:14:28       So that's the part that you're right about. That's what that textbook talks about. Now that does not mean that does not imply that insulin causes fat storage as in the accumulation of fat from day to day. And let me explain why that is. So insulin is basically a traffic cop that allows your body to burn the fuel that you just consumed. So when you eat a diet that's high in carbohydrate and low in fat, your insulin goes up, your body restricts the fat from going out of fat cells. It turns that down, not off but down. It causes less fat to come out of your fat cells and then your body's burning carbs. That's what you just ate right now. If you eat a diet that's high in fat and lower in carbohydrate, you secrete less insulin. Those effects don't occur on your fat cells and that allows your body to burn the fat that you just ate.

Speaker 1:          02:15:21       But at the end of the day, the amount of fat that you have in your body is the amount that you, eight minus the amount that you burned. That's what determines the amount. This is just arithmetic, right amount that you eight minus the amount that you burned and if you eat a low fat diet, you're not eating much and you're not burning much. You're in the same place as if you're eating a diet where you're eating a lot of fat and burning a lot of fat. And the way we know that's true is because varying the amount of carbohydrate and fat in the Diet makes no difference to body fatness in randomized controlled trials. So I know that what I just said is correct. No. So the, first of all, it's one randomized controlled trial. Which Kevin Hall or gamma? No, I'm talking about a Meta analysis of randomized controlled trials to meta-analyses. We decided that, I think that the, Oh, what's wrong with men analysis from it? He doesn't like crappy study ever done. He doesn't like who did it basically. No, no, no, no. I don't care who does it. I don't like men analyses. I don't like the concept of am. I think it's one of the problems with modern nutritional and medical sciences. You do crappy studies generate garbage and then you sift through the and say, I can find

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       a truth in here. And the answer is do better. Studies, answers, always do better studies you can't do, yeah, Med analyses, they exist for everything. The issue was just as a simple, and remember we're talking about the 10 calories a day. So when you said the difference between the fat burned and the fat store or the fat consumed in the fat expand that has to be 10 calories a day. That's that's what we're talking about. 10 calories in the fat tissue. Okay. So if it is true that if I consume 1500 calories a day and I somehow metabolizer excrete 1490, and I guarantee that no such study was ever so carefully done, the support this, uh, well you could think of, you're sensing the energy balanced consortium study, the Kevin Hall study that we've talked about. One of the things, there are two things that happened when you put people on a ketogenic diet, among other things, you generate ketones and you lose ketones in the breadth and in the urine.

Speaker 3:          02:17:25       And one of the things you have to do in these energy balance experiments is measure calories loss through fecal material. Who knows, maybe you jack up the fat consumption. Maybe they lose more fat calories when they shit it out. Or maybe you set up the five calories matter. I think when you're measuring the fat balance, which you're talking about, you have to measure the amount of fat in and out. And so I'm giving you an example in response to your question was could you give me an example in that study, they didn't do either of those measurements. They modeled one and the other one, they couldn't get the, the assay to work after a year or two years and gave up on it. And so you just don't know. But getting back to this question, we're talking about somebody's storing 10 calories of fat and their fat cells, let's never get away from that or 20 calories. And so the question is always, is this mechanism, uh, capable of explaining the 20 calories or is the, what did you find him looking in that book? Well, it's essentially what he was saying and then sun inhibits fat mobilization from,

Speaker 2:          02:18:30       well, I can read it if you want me to read it. You know, I mean, but I mean, Gary and I both agree with what's in that textbook. You can read it if you want it. Restraints, fat mobilization through two mechanisms. So suppression of light light policies, is that, what was that right, yeah. Life policy. So mechanisms are described in the text and the stimulation of the re esterification of fatty acids within the ad, a ad, a pile as dining site at depth insights at depth depth fat cells. Note that the same process of uh, esterification we'll also be simultaneously incorporated fatty acids from circulating tri glycerol. Glycerides. Yeah. Uh, triacylglycerol triacylglycerol triacylglycerol right. Released by lipid protein. Lipos

Speaker 3:          02:19:25       land pays limb pays enough. Joe [inaudible] piece. Yeah. L I p a s e a into stored try ass soul glycerol. Yeah. So let me explain this briefly. Big words. The argument I've been making and others is that insulin inhibits fat loss. If you're a fat cell and you see insulin, you hold onto your fat, right? It's kind of that simple. Stephan's absolutely right. This book, which is, we're talking about, is it metabolic regulation of human perspective? It's written by Keith Frane, who's retired. Oxford professor is a wonderful man and he was the world's leading authority on metabolic regulation. How your body controls its use of fuel and orchestrates storage and oxidation. And in this book, Keith Frane talks about how insulin determines fat accumulation and fat cells. And this is the accumulation, whatever, fat storage, fat storage, fat try NAMIC fatty acid trafficking in and out of fat cells. Okay, thank you. So the first time I ever interviewed Keith was for a piece I was doing for the journal Science on a insulin resistance. And we spent about an hour on the phone and he explained to me for 20 minutes all the ways insulin traps the Turmans fatty acid trafficking across the fat cell membrane. And you raise until then you will accumulate more fat on the short term. And then we got to obesity and they said, well be cities, you know, caused by a

Speaker 3:          02:21:01       people eating too much. And I said, Keith, when we were talking about why fat cells get fad was all insulin mediated. And when we were talking about people get fad, it was this eating too much thing. Okay. And you switched mechanisms on me. So my assumption is the same reason people get fat as the same reason their fat cells get fat. And you've got a whole lot of, you've got this disorder metabolic syndrome we're talking about, which includes not just uh, uh,

Speaker 4:          02:21:34       yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:21:35       problems with your blood lipids, but it includes getting fat or your waistline increasing. And it's an insulin resistance related disorder, which means your insulin is elevated. And again, this is where we end up with two hypotheses about why insulin is elevated. But if the friends and sugar can elevate insulin and you end up with metabolic syndrome, you're in fat storage mode. That's the terminology of Diet book doctors. So now you're storing fat and only have to do 10 calories a day, 20 calories a day, you're going to get obese. And it's insulin mediate and insolence responding to the carbohydrate content of the Diet primarily. And that's it. And when I said this to Keith, you know, you've got one mechanism for white fat cells get fat and a different mechanism for why humans get fat. And I'd like to talk about this over eating concept.

Speaker 3:          02:22:22       Um, he said, you know, I never thought of that. I mean, the guy had been in the field 40 years and he let them maybe 50 and then I had a long conversation with him. I was back in Oxford when I did that insane Alan Aragon debate. I stopped off at Oxford on the way to Manchester and we had a long conversation with Keith. I said, look, what I want you to do is just come up with a hypothesis of obesity from the fat cells perspective, right? Shed your brain centric energy balance centric thing and ask yourself what does the fat cell c and if nothing else asked a student to do it as an experiment. I mean that would be a great thought experiment for kid. What's going to make a fat cell fat and that our assumption is going to be that's what's going to make a human fat.

Speaker 3:          02:23:06       Okay. And Keith said, he literally said to me, he was retiring and he was going off to garden. Um, I kind of envied him, but he said, no, I just can't, I can't put energy balance aside. You're telling me to not think in terms of it's been taken expenditure and I can't do it. And I mean wonderful man. He literally, and this is again what I've been arguing is all these people are soap, including Stephen who was, you know, who learned in this world. They're, they're so locked into this thinking that obesity is this energy imbalance and they can't get away from it. So everything they do, everything they interpret. And when Stephen says there's study after study and there's 20 randomized control studies and it's sort of, I'm going to shovel the evidence on top of you. And I'm saying, look, I guarantee if we go through those 20 studies, I'll be just like the Jim Hill study. They assumed energy balance was the cause and then they wanted to see what caused energy imbalance. And they started with the wrong hypothesis. They're trapped in a paradigm. We've all seen this. Can I respond to this? Okay. So,

Speaker 1:          02:24:09       uh, Gary, I preordered your book. I have a copy of your book right here. Good calories, bad calories. I preordered this in 2008 because I was so excited to read this book. Yes. And will email me. I tore through it and I was so persuaded when I initially read this 10 years ago that I ate a low carbohydrate diet for six months cause I thought I was, I thought the carbs, we're going to make me fat and give me diabetes. So I was fully immersed and convinced by your perspective when I read this book. Yeah. And you and you sign this book, you see I have your signature. We had a very nice dinner together and the thing that caused me to go away from that perspective was when I actually started investigating the evidence on my own underlying these ideas. I started doing my own research.

Speaker 1:          02:25:01       I didn't take your word for it. I started doing my own research in the lab as well and actually doing real scientific studies. But what you are standing and found that it did not line up with what you were saying in your book. And what I ended up realizing about good calories, bad calories is essentially your arguments primarily rely on historical narratives and speculation. And there's very little of actually saying what is the most pertinent scientific evidence to answer this question. And what does that evidence have to say? It's mostly historical narratives. And honestly, you know, I'm, I'm going to try to say this in in a non insulting way, but I will simply say that others who have looked at the same historical evidence have come to different conclusions then you have. Um, and that includes me in the places where I've looked at the historical evidence. And so, um, I think that, you know, this idea that I am like locked in some paradigm and can't see what you're talking about. I was there Gary. I am posting. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:26:02       let me then, okay, so let me, let me, let me just, it was interesting cause you're going to wrap this up soon. So we've really gone there three hours almost. Um, remember when you drove up here from San Diego this morning and I was listening to Stephan on a different podcast and you were talking about how your eating behavior differed on low carb diets versus the higher carb diet you eat now. And you talked about your resistance, it was easier to fast on the low carb diet. Correct. Okay. And you didn't really have an explanation for it. I don't have a very well anyway, go ahead. Yeah, so again, the argument I've been making is this, there's two ways to look at everything. So one way is the low carb diet, somehow the, because of, I don't food reward his shoes affects your urge to eat car and low carb foods. And because of that you don't

Speaker 3:          02:27:03       hunger for them as much. And uh, when you're on a higher carb diet, I think the way you phrased on and start the podcast was your body sort of tells you what to meal time. So it's conditioned to me better. So the alternative hypothesis here, the other way to think about it is on the low carb diet isn't insulin levels are staying lower. And when they're saying lower, he's mobilizing fat and he's oxidizing that fat. And as you said on the podcast, and have you been, uh, you know, the 135 pound marathon or has enough fat in this body to run for a week. So the reason you're able to skip meals is because insulin is low fuel. My wife is calling, she's probably telling me I'm getting shrill. Um, there's a different way to look at everything. That's the point I'm trying to put every study. I mean,

Speaker 1:          02:27:47       tell me evidence that, can you give me actual evidence that the lower level of insulin is the cause of not needing to use

Speaker 3:          02:27:56       his meals? No. Okay. I'm giving you a high palm. Glad you're being all gamuts. No, that's what you're saying. Like we were talking about fasting, right? If you're fasting for a certain prolonged period of time, your body's going to go into a ketogenic state. We all agree with that. Right? And that's, that's the reason why it's easier to fast. Once you're in key to genic states, your body starts burning off fat and this is a widely reported that's living on fat. It's metabolically flexible. You don't have date cause, but it's the idea that it's living on your fat is evidence that you're getting thinner on that low carb diet is, it's that balance. It's the amount of your eating minus the amount your burn now, but it's a question as it's tossed with the amount you're trapping and that's what you keep leaving out. So if you have no, that has been tested is what I'm saying.

Speaker 3:          02:28:41       It has not been tested. That's what I'm saying. That's why we founded Nusi. That's why we spent $30 million. That's why David Ludwig is doing another $13 million starting. It has not been tested. When you, when you feed people, whether it's overfeeding or underfeeding and you're causing weight loss or weight maintenance, the carb to fat ratio of the Diet makes almost no different. Me Give you another many studies on this famous feeding study from the 60s which I thought when you said Horton, I thought you meant Ed Hort, not Tj Horton. So at Horton and Ethan Sims at a prisoner study, they literally, they wanted to get the overfeed. Again, they're using their thinking in terms of eating too much. They wanted to get first get college kids to gain 25% of excess body weight. This was in the 60s and they couldn't get the college kids to do it, which suggests that college kids were different in the 60s and they are today. So they used prisoners in the Vermont state prison and they overfed them. And you discuss this in your book. Um, they could get these prisoners to eat 10,000 calories a day of excess carbohydrates, excess calories. It was calories, not carbohydrate, might've been calories. They couldn't get them to add more than a thousand calories of fat. Okay. And they talk about this, Sim studies were crazy cause they published in 15 different journals. So they interpret the study. If you looked at pounds gained,

Speaker 4:          02:30:06       okay

Speaker 3:          02:30:06       per calorie added, they gained more per calorie of fat than they did per calorie of carbs. But if you looked at how much they could eat, they couldn't add that much fat and they could add eight thousand seven thousand extras calories of carbs in. It's actually a line in one of the papers when they said they would eat 10,000 calories and then go to bed hungry, craving more carbs. So then the question becomes, again, is it because the carbs are doing something in the brain to increase food reward or is it the carbs are doing something in the body so that their body has figured out a way it can orchestrate deal with this massive influx of carbs versus fat. But there's always two ways to look at it. And every time Stephen says there's masses of evidence, my job as a journalist was to go through and say, does this refute that hypothesis? And if it doesn't, we have to hold onto it. Because remember we have an obesity and diabetes epidemic and the kind of advice where we tell people to sleep better

Speaker 3:          02:31:07       and eat less or avoid foods that they love, don't have pizza and ice cream. It's implies that the reason they get fat, even the overeating and hypothesis, you think they should be eating pizza and cream? What do you think? Uh, no, I think we would both say don't eat pizza and I don't ask questions like that. Thank you. Um, the, uh, is something wrong out there? Tragically wrong. We know. If nothing else, I think you would agree with us. So the whole low carb movement, it's, you set it on this podcast was that, you know what I've done, if nothing else, as I've convinced people, they could eat low carb diets without killing themselves. So that's a good thing. And I'm implying that I assume what the sugar book, even if I'm wrong, that getting people to eat less sugar is a good thing. So ultimately these are good things that I've done.

Speaker 3:          02:31:56       My overall really, Gary, not entirely because you're telling people that only carbohydrate matters. I'm not telling Halleran table hardware. You have argued at length. I in calorie intake and dietary fat intake and physical activity do not influenced body fatness and are not important for your with your ex the wrong way. I'm arguing that. No, if you're going to look at the model that we published that you contributed to and we signed off on, it doesn't say anything about physics says that physical activity, dietary fat intake and calorie and take are not important. Refuse that. Somebody who's on Scott that way because they were sedentary. Okay, okay. Requires, but what I'm saying is that there is harm in what you're saying because yes, we all agree that these carbohydrates are fattening. But you're saying that these other important things are irrelevant and that's the dangerous part of what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          02:32:53       No, what I'm saying about calories is it's the wrong way to think about it. So wait, you think they do matter? I chained calories or the wrong. Don't put words in went. Okay. Do they matter? Do calories matter our way to measure the quantity of food you're eating? It could use grams. You could use anything else that you want. The question is, is it the right way to think about it? Can you solve an obesity? Let me give you an example before we go. Let me just read. So excess calorie intake and physical inactivity or secondary to this process and not themselves determinants of body fat. That is what you said. Fine in our, uh, can I read you some debate notes? Okay. That's, I'm not putting words in your mouth. You just want to read that yet, but that's different than what you just tried.

Speaker 3:          02:33:36       Okay, sure it is. They're just, okay. Let me read you something. They just never seem to be enough food to sift shade Carl's growing body afterschool. You would need a footlong sub before his mother's home cooked dinners. Even after having a hefty lunch of homemade chicken, rice and vegetables and his favorite snacks, granola bars and bunch or crunch. Okay. A lot of calories and a lot of them are one person. We are talking about what we, yeah. How is this going to, I just want to know, just one of my colleagues has one anecdotal, one of my problems with the hoe over eating hypothesis is it's taught to logical. You don't know if someone's overeating unless they're fat.

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       Right? Uh, incorrect. Well, this fellow, I just read your calorie intake and you can know, well, wait a second about there Gary. We would eat a footlong sub before it's mother's home cooked dinners. Even after having a half the lunch of homemade chicken, rice and vegetables. Again, that's one story, but the point is, my point is it's like you cannot tell if someone's fat. I, you have no idea how many calories I consume. Right. I could probably get a pretty decent estimate actually based on a published formulas. Okay. So, and then how would you know whether I was overeating? Remember we're talking about 10 calories get stored in the fat tissue. Well that depends on whether you meet, how you define that. But um, I, I could look at your body composition and I could tell you whether you are over eating relative to a lean person.

Speaker 1:          02:35:12       Yes. Because I have excess body fat. Correct. Yeah. So without knowing if I have excess body fat, you cannot tell whether I'm overeating, which is the cause of the excess body fat. Right? Doesn't that strike you as circular? There's nothing circular about it. Look, if you take somebody and you increase their calorie intake, carbs or fat, either way, the gain, body fat, there's nothing circular on it. I'm not saying that calories in choice body pretty confident that the fellow, and if you take someone who is currently has obesity and you reduced their calorie intake, carbs or fat doesn't make any difference, they lose body fat. There's nothing circular about this calorie thing at all. It does make it, no, no, I just, I don't understand how you could possibly think that was circular. It's so simple and direct. Let me go through it one more time.

Speaker 2:          02:36:00       No, listen, you're not going through anything. One more time. We're going to wrap this up cause I don't think we're getting anything done here.

Speaker 1:          02:36:07       Uh, it was a lot of fun. It was that much fun.

Speaker 2:          02:36:11       It was, it was interesting. I mean there's, I, I don't know who to believe quite honestly. I think, uh, you both make some excellent points and a, I think there's definitely some real legitimate concern that you have about his position. And I think that your position, it has some merit as well, the position about insulin and about carbohydrates and sugar. Um, this is a really long conversation and I think we could probably do this for another six days. Forget about hours. Uh, I think, uh, if I would recommend people, I think people have to really kind of figure this out for themselves. I would recommend, uh, Stefan, please recommend your book. What is your book again? The book is called the hungry, very hungry brain and it's available everywhere. Amazon, all that jazz. And uh, Gary,

Speaker 1:          02:36:58       yeah, it's a good calories, bad calories or why we get fat or the case against sugar. I think we've just begun this debate. I don't think I'm going on a lot of evidence here that I didn't have time to site, unfortunately. Yeah. Well, it was a long one, but thank you gentlemen. Thank

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       you. All right. Thank you Joe.
