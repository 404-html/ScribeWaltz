Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Here we go. And boom, we're lot Graham. Great to see you again. Nice to be away. Um, and we were just talking about your, your new book America before that. There's two versions of it. There's one version and then there's a newer version that's a Barnes and noble version that's specific to Barnes and noble that has an extra whole chapter in it. That's correct. Yeah. And so they can get that at Barnes and noble. I'm just trying to keep bookstores alive men through either way. I think it's really important. And that's, and that's what are the reasons that I did this because, because I, I had finished the book and then Barnes and noble came to me through my publishes and ad said they would like to do a special edition of the book, but in order to do that, I needed to write them some extra material.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Uh, Adam and I had a lot of material that I hadn't put in the book and I thought, well, this is an opportunity to put that out there. Beautiful. So if people want that, it's a little bit different than there's a small goal. Okay. So festival, my website, Graham hancock.com has a page about America before and the link to the Barnes and noble edition is there as well as the link to the standard edition, which is on Amazon and iTunes and all kinds of all kinds of other places. So Graham hancock.com and the America before page. The link to the bonds of double edition is right there. All right, there it is. So, um, how has this, Oh, before we even get into what does it go to talks and events. Okay, we're on the Graham Hancock website. Go to books. So I and fucks go to America before Bam, Bam.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Go to United States. You can see Amazon bods and there's Barnes and nobles, special edition. Nationalization. Click on that. There you go. And then the Ebook as well, the ebook audio book, which I read myself, x is available there. And then if you scroll down, um, oops, that shouldn't be there. Damn popups son. I am so happy you read it yourself. I get angry when someone else reads someone who I'm like, come on, he can talk. Yeah, I enjoy reading. What books myself and what I've, what I've learned from feedback I get from audiences at presentations is people like me doing that. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah, a hundred percent it's just weird when someone else is talking in your voice like, hey man, I know you're not cramped. You know that I write fiction as well as the [inaudible] and the one thing I can't read is my fiction really well.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       Yeah, because fictions requires accents. You really need an access to read a fiction book who can get into the different characters. But for a nonfiction book like America before, it's very straightforward for me just to read it myself, I agree. I'm a tremendous Stephen King Fan, but when I read Stephen King's books where he reads them or listen to him when he reads them of their terrible, he's awful at it. I don't think at Novelis should, should read there. Bare on levels. I think that's it. That's a job for an actor. Oddly enough, I've just been reading Stephen King's dark tower series that just very near the end of the seventh volume of that. Yeah. I'm just a giant fan of his. But man, when he reads it, he reads it like he's just reading it. Yeah. It's like, Ooh, this is rough. It's hard to get behind anyway. Um, America before.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       So there's, give us the website, there's, there's details about the book, there's a page where there are links to the book. And also the other thing I would like to take this opportunity to mention is I'm in America and Canada for the next seven weeks and I'm going to be doing something like 25 presentations in something like 20 American cities and then three Canadian cities in, in Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto and that's all on the talks and events page of my website. So if everybody wants to come along and meet this old man in person, uh, I will be Elvis doing those events.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       And Are you doing these at theaters and you allow Q and A's?

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       Absolutely. I allow, I allow Q and A's. I encourage that. I, I feel as an author that frankly speaking, I'm nothing without my audience. I owe my audience, my readers big time. And what I try to do at events is to give back as much as I can. So if people want to take pictures with me, I am absolutely up for that. I don't understand why anybody would want to do that, but it's fun. It's kind of fun. I wouldn't be more to come to the desk where I'm signing and asked me personal questions. I'm ready to do that. Sometimes on the British book tour, which I just finished, I was behind in the, in the event space for four hours after the event, finished siding and taking and taking pictures. But it's a joy. It's an, it's a really opportunity for me to interact with the, with with the people who actually make my work matters. So that's fantastic.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       Beautiful. So what inspired this? I know there's, there's always been, well, you, first of all, we should just say for people who don't know, you have been at the front of the line for decades talking about these lost civilizations and w w w, w from reading your work. I mean, I think our first read your work in the 90s, you exposed me to a lot of these, what were at the time controversial ideas that have now been substantiated by actual evidence, particularly go back like tapping and I mean the, the, the, all the water erosion stuff on the Sphinx and I've since had doctor Robert Schoch on the podcast to talk about that as well. But all this stuff, um, was at one point very controversial and now far less. Yes. I mean whatever traditional academics and traditional historians that are trying to, I guess is archeologists that we're trying to resist, they've let go a lot of that. They've had to, with things like go right, actually

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       tapped. They've had to because they have it dead, it says as overwhelmed them and go back to the, he is an excellent example. Prior to the discovery and excavation of Quebec Tepi, uh, which is a site in Anatolia in Turkey, it was the view, very firm view of archeologists that there had been no megalithic architecture anywhere on earth. And when I say Megalithic, I mean literally big stones, stone circles, huge constructions, nothing like that before at the very, very earliest, 6,000 years ago. And they would point to sites in, for example, Malta, a site called [inaudible], which is about 5,800 years old. That's the oldest megalithic architecture in the world. And they could understand how that was because these were agricultural societies, they generated surpluses. You could free up people who could become specialists in architecture, in astronomy and geometry, and they could apply their skills to the construction of these sites.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       But what they never considered possible was that a society that was hunter gatherers would have created a gigantic megalithic site and then suddenly go back. Lee Tapi is discovered, it dates to 11,600 years ago. It's more than 5,000 years older than the supposedly oldest megalithic architecture in the world. And it is in the center where there had been no previous evidence of agriculture. But the moment go back in Tempe appears agriculture appears as well. Um, and this is just something that's really hard for archaeology to explain. They've suddenly got 5,000 years of missing, of missing history that they've just never taken into account. And what I see them doing is largely avoiding the problem rather than getting, getting to grips with it directly. And in fact, there have been, there have been a great number of changes in the last 20 years, which, which, uh, have worked generally in favor of the arguments that I've, that I've proposed.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       Well, I'm so happy for you because I know that for a long time you were out there on your own a lot of these theories very, very much so. And, and uh, also subjected to the most, the most blistering and deeply unpleasant criticism from, uh, from the archeological fraternity and from their friends in the, in, in the media. Like how dare this journalist, uh, propose that history might be different or that we might have a forgotten chapter in the human story. It was regarded almost as offensive that I would put this material out there and archeologist felt it was their responsibility to show the public that I was full of shit. And that was, and that was the whole way my work was, was greeted and to a certain extent still is greeted by a Kale juice. But things have changed. Central to my work was the notion of a global cataclysm, roughly twelve thousand five hundred twelve thousand eight hundred years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       There was, it made sense to me in 1995 when I wrote fingerprints of the gods, but there was no compelling evidence for a global cataclysm. Then I just add all the evidence seems to point to that time and a massive global event. And then from 2007 onwards, you know, more than a decade after I wrote fingerprints of the Gods, we get a group of more than 60 major scientists who are seriously proposing that the earth was hit by multiple fragments of a giant comment 12,800 years ago. And that this caused a huge rise in sea level and extinctions of mega foreigners. They are not saying that it also wiped out a lost advanced civilization of prehistory. I'm saying that, but, but what, what has changed is that we now have compelling hard scientific evidence. I'm not saying every scientist accepts it. It's the nature of science to dispute findings.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       But we have a group of 60 major figures who have seriously proposed this in all the leading mainstream journals. And it's changed the balance of power in this, in this argument. Because one thing that they used to say is Hancock can't be right because there was no global cataclysm, you know, 12 or thousand years ago. Well now we know there was and there are various explanations for it. So that's moved things along. And the other thing that's changed a lot is the attitude of the man in the street to authority that has changed. Back in the nineties authority figures were the gatekeepers. They controlled everything. If the authority figure in a discipline like archaeology said, Hancock is completely wrong. He's made all this stuff up that would generally be believed not by everybody, but by the majority of people today to have a, a mainstream authority figures say that to me is actually an advantage because people are so distrustful of authority and rightly so because we've been lied to by authority figures in all fields for so long.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       The bullshit has been so enormous that people are finally waking up. But we can't trust what authority figures say. And I think we can thank the Internet for that. We can thank the Internet for that. You, I'm sure you've seen the more recent evidence of a crater that they just discovered like fairly recently. Greenland. Yes. Enormous and north and enormous. It's an enormous crater. Uh, it's, um, 18 miles wide. Uh, it had not been discovered before because it's under ice. It's under a lot of ice. At the end of the ice age, Greenland was one area which never lost its ice cover completely, whereas North America, everywhere north of Minnesota was covered in ice, a mild, sometimes two miles deep. Europe, the same northern Europe. But greed land kept its eyes, whereas the other parts of the world lost their eyes at the, at the end of the ice age.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       And what's interesting about Greenland is there's already evidence of a comet impact in Greenland, which goes back to papers published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013 that they found what a called impact proxies in Greenland. In other words, Nano diamonds, carbons fails, and no evidence of a lot of platinum and an iron, uh, was found in a layer in the ice data to 12,000, 800 years ago. But the next development that you're absolutely right, and this was just a few months ago, was the discovery of this humongous crater in Greenland and evidence that it was caused by an iron impact her of some kind. Now dating of it. I would be irresponsible to say that that crater definitely dates to 12,800 years ago because the work has not been done to prove that yet. But what I can say and what the specialists who have explored an excavator, the crater are saying is that it's recent, uh, they can say for sure that it happened during the last ice age.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       Under it under the crater is nothing but massively disturbed and destroyed and completely wrecked ice from the ice age, from the place to sit above it is smooth, perfect ice from our epoch, which is called the Holocene, which began about 11,600 years ago. So all the evidence suggests that this created dates to that period between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, but to absolutely confirm that more work needs to be done, but it's part of a growing pattern. The younger dryas impact to they is, they call themselves, they call this the younger dryas impact hypothesis. And it's because there was a period in, in the earth's geological history that geologists called the younger dryas, which lasted for 1,200 years, from 12,800 to 11,600 years ago. It's a very mysterious period. We see all the megafauna dying off suddenly and rapidly. We see rises in sea level. We see a huge collapse in global temperature.

Speaker 1:          00:12:19       It's a, it's a cataclysmic, a epoch. And, and what, what, what is becoming clearer and clearer, uh, is that the evidence that a comet behind it was behind it is, it is extremely strong. And as more and more evidence comes in, we realized how widespread it was. So they found evidence of the impact as far south as Antarctica. Now, previously they were focused very much on North American. Now as far south as Antarctica, as far east as Syria, this was truly a global, a global event and it changed the world. And I think, and it's my case that it wiped our memory of a previous episode of, of human civilization that right at the epicenter of this cataclysm was a civilization that we would regard as advanced, not as simple hunter, gather a civilization which was utterly wiped out in this cataclysmic event.

Speaker 2:          00:13:06       And I should say for anyone who's really fascinated right now, please maybe pause and go listen to the one that the two that you did with Randall Carlson. Yeah. We're really goes into depth about the impact, the evidence of these impacts, the evidence of the very quick demise of the Ice Age and what may have resulted in all these floods that you read about in the epic of Gilgamesh that you read about a Noah's Ark and that all these things are probably tales that have stories that people pass down from generation to generation that survived.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Yeah. Because we now know that at that time between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, truly global cataclysmic events involving rapid rises in sea level, uh, did occur. And suddenly the worldwide tradition of, uh, of a global flood stops being just a myth and starts being a memory and account of, of real events. It's been my privilege to work very closely with rattle Carlson. He's a, Randall is absolutely amazing. He is a total genius. He's also a gentle giant and such a kind, generous, spirited person. It's a joy to work with them and every minute spent with him as an education, I had the privilege of traveling across the channel, scab lands in Washington state with Randall and seeing things through his eyes really opened my eyes to the scale of this disaster. You know, you could look at these giant boulders called glaciated erotics, and they just look odd sitting there in the landscape.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       But when you really consider how they got there that they got there in icebergs, the size of oil tankers that were carried on floods that were at least 500 up to a thousand feet deep that we're tearing through the channels. Scab, lads literally ripping the landscape apart. Then the icebergs would ground on valley sides. The flood waters would recede, the icebergs would be left there, giant icebergs, and as they melted away, they revealed the rocks that had in chain that we're caught up within them and they're scattered all over the landscape. And you look at that and you think anything that was underneath that 12,800 years ago is gone completely. There can't be anything left of it at all. Utterly, utterly destroyed. And I would encourage people that are interested in this to please watch the youtube videos of it. Cause Randall provides all sorts of video and photographic evidence where you can take a look at the landscape and you get a perspective of how immense this destruction was.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       Yeah, it's, it's really, it's really important to, to see that because it's easy enough to talk about floods and, and, and cataclysms. But actually to see its effect on the landscape directly is it has an emotional, an emotional impact. I felt, I felt emotional traffic traveling across the challenge, Gab lands, really realizing that this was, was the heart of an event that changed the world completely. And the evidence continues to build. I have in America before I have not gone over old ground that I went over in magicians of the gods that we covered in the various, um, interviews and podcasts in which it's really a good idea that people take a look at. But I, what I have done is added the new information published since 2015 which further supports the younger dryas impact hypothesis and the notion that multiple fragments of a giant comment, uh, hit the earth and created an absolute global catastrophe.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       So what was the motivation behind creating this book America before? It's a curious mixture of things. I have been exploring the possibility of a lost civilization for more than 25 years. That was the essence of my book, fingerprints of the Gods that was published in 1995 that there has been a huge forgot an episode in human history. I continued to follow that in a series of other books and by the time I got to 2002 when I published a book called underworld that followed seven years of scuba diving on continental shelves, looking for structures that were submerged by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age, I really felt I'd done it. I felt I'd walk the walk, I put, put out to the public a massive body of information and I thought, my role in this is over and I can breathe a sigh of relief because it's hot in this particular kitchen and I can go do something else.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       And I ended up writing a book about psychedelics. I ended up writing supernatural meetings with the ancient teachers of mankind, but the role of psychedelics in the origins of the, of the human story. But then new information started to come out that touched on the lost civilization idea. And I couldn't just stand by and ignore that information. That's why I published in magicians of the Gods in 2015. And then as I was researching that book, I became aware of something I hadn't realized before that there's a mass of new information from the Americas, specifically from the Americas, which completely rewrites the story of human history that the Americas, um, have been misrepresented, uh, for a very long time, uh, by archaeology. And archeologists will be annoyed with me for saying that they have a way of forgetting their own arrows, uh, of saying, Oh, well, we knew that all along.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       It wasn't, it wasn't the case, but the fact of the matter remains that for best part of 50 years from the 1960s through until about 2010, American archeology was locked in a dogma that they actually had a name for, which was Clovis first, uh, that they invented a name for a culture. They call them the Clovis culture. We don't know what they called themselves. They were hunter gatherers. They first appear in the archeological record 13,400 years ago, and they've banished from the archeological record 12,600 years ago. And for a very long time, it was maintained adamantly that these were the first Americans that no human being touched the soil of the Americas until 13,000, 400 years ago. Just animals. But no human beings present at all. And any archeologist who attempted to dispute that dogma, and I use the word deliberately, there should be no room for dogma in science, but any archeologist who challenged that would face severe problems with his or her career, they would be mocked and humiliated at conferences like an archeologist called Jackson Kumar's from, from Canada who excavated in the, in the, in the Yukon, humiliated at conferences, insulted, accused of making stuff up.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       Uh, their research funding would be withdrawn basically to challenge Clovis first was the end of your archaeological career. So naturally, very few archeologists wanted to challenge Clovis first. What was this gentleman in the Yukon? What was this is called Jack sank. Mars a and interestingly, the Smithsonian just in 2017, uh, did a big kind of mayor Kulpa big admission about this, that everybody had got things wrong, that Jack's Hank Mars had been ruined by the Clovis first lobby, but he'd been right all along the site. He excavated in the Yukon, was re excavated in 2017 and every single thing he said was correct even though they had just sneered at him. What was he? He was activating in the 1980s in the 1990 [inaudible] he's still alive. He's still alive. Yeah. Well I think he's been indicated. You know, and it's kind of, it's kind of nice to be vindicated that that there's almost a place in folk lore, folk law for the, for the individual who is scorned and humiliated, you know, by, by others.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       But who turns out to be, to be right. And he was right. But my point about this is that what it meant was since it was the dogma that Clovis was first, that they oldest dates were 13,400 years ago. There seemed to be no logic to archeologists in digging deeper. You know how it is with archaeology that the, the upper levels are the youngest and the deeper you go, the older it gets. That's why we say Upper Paleolithic for the late Ice Age and lower Paleolithic for the late stone age and lower for the older stone age and the feeling was no need to dig below the Clovis layer because we already know that there were no human beings. Then before that. And then a few archeologists I mentioned Jack Sank Mars. But uh, but, uh, another is all good year from the University of South Carolina who excavated a site called topper in South Carolina now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Now topper is an incredibly rich Clovis site. It's full of their tools, their points. They made these special special Flint points that we used as arrowheads and spear great Clovis site. He finished excavating the Clovis level and then he did something that was supposed not to be done. He decided to dig deeper and he carried on deeping down, digging down. And there was a, a layer of about a meter and a half of of barren soil. And then beneath that more human artifacts. And they finally date those back to more than 50,000 years ago. And then in 2017, published in nature by Tom Demorais, who's the chief paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum, uh, at a bunch of other very high level paleontologists published in nature magazine, evidence for human presence in North America 130,000 years ago. Now this is really put the cat amongst the pigeons. Now, if humans were pressed North America 130,000 years ago and archeologists have been telling us for 50 years that they were only present from 13,000 years ago, that's 10 times as long that we've had humans in North America capable of doing stuff and the archeological dogma has prevented any search for what they were doing until, until very recently.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       What was the evidence from 130,000 years ago? Okay, so what, it's not the, let me be clear about this because, because this is, this is something that is often misrepresented in, in my views. It is not the evidence for an advanced civilization that we find a 130,000 years ago in America. The evidence that we find is evidence for human presence. And what they were doing was very much stone age stuff. It's a Mastodon, it's a mastodon skeleton. Uh, that was, that was excavated. It was actually found by accident during road construction near near San Diego. And an archeologist was attached to the road construction crew at immediately stopped construction and they investigated it thoroughly. And what they found was so much dynamite in the early 1990s when they found it, that they decided not to publish at the time because what they found was evidence that those mastodon bones had been cracked open by human beings using tools and that the marrow had been extracted, that one Tusk could be left standing upright in the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       And another had been left beside it, that FEMA had a femur of the animal had been taken away completely from the site. Uh, and there was assemblages of, of instruments that we use to smash and break the bones. And the conclusion of the team was that only one kind of creature could have done that work using tools on a mastodon. And that's human beings. That's classic, classic human behavior. So this sets the goalposts in a totally different place. Suddenly we have to consider that humans have been in for 130,000 years. We already know that a dogmatic approach of archeology has rather refused to look at anything older than 13,000 years ago. And what it does is it generates an engine of demand that we need to be looking at those missing hundred thousand plus years. We need to be looking at it hard. Of course, the immediate reaction has not been to go looking for stuff in the other hundred thousand years.

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       Most archeologists have responded by saying, this is impossible. It can't be. It can't be so, but that's precisely what they said to Jack Sank Mars, who said that humans were in bluefish caves in the Yukon 25,000 years ago, and it's precisely what they said to our Goodyear who said humans had been at topper 50,000 years ago and they were both right and I believe that Tom Demorais and his team, you don't get a big article published in nature unless it's already pretty solidly based and pretty much peer reviews. It has produced a reaction. I would be wrong to say that it's universally accepted. It's very much challenged. That is intriguing. What is the challenge? The challenge fundamentally comes from we archeologists know that there were no human beings in the Americas that far back. To put it in perspective. It's about 60,000 years before the first evidence of human beings in Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       Uh, it's about 60,000 years before the first evidence of human beings in Australia. And this is just evidence of the first human beings. Yes, we have to point out how difficult it is to find evidence. Extremely difficult to find. You know, sometimes we imagined that archeologists are working with masses of skeletal material low. They're not, then they're not. I mean the whole, this is one of the ironies, the whole Clovis first dogma, you would think that they had masses of material to work with. They did have the tools, but in terms of skeletal remains, just one, just one single skeletal remains from one of the things that Michael Shermer had sent me, was this a dispute that perhaps the bones had been cracked open by the excavation material? Yeah. Excabation machines. I saw Michael's email email last night and I appreciate that Michael wants to continue to engage with this subject and that's his job.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       He's a pro. He's a professional skeptic and it's his, his role to do so. But what he, what he misses that it's true that a new paper has been published, which raises questions over the, uh, what's called the Cerruti Mastodon site, which is the site that Tom Demorais at San Diego Natural History Museum excavated. And what's interesting since I can, since Michael took the trouble to write the questions, can I just, sure. Can I just read you something that I responded to them this? Sure. Which is the microphone. Those, yeah. Yeah. Basic. Basically this, this, this paper was in no way a refutation of the original paper in nature. As a matter of fact, the gentleman who wrote that paper never even looked at the archaeological remains that are in the now in the San Diego Natural History Museum. Um, what it is, what he based it on, his reference, I'm quoting from the abstract of the paper itself, reference to a freeway right of way map and construction plans, contemporary road building practices and work site photographs available on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       In other words, the site was not visited. They simply looked at secondary references. They did not look at the archeological material and they ignored the entire argument of Tom Demmer and his colleagues who had already addressed that issue. They didn't look at the bones, they did not look at the bones. When you, when you break a fresh bone, it has a characteristic kind of spiral fracture that does not happen when you break a fossilized bone. And Tom Debray and his team specifically ruled out road making machinery as responsible for this breaking pattern because they actually carried out experiments on a modern elephants, deceased elephants, and they broke their bones. And the kind of fracture that you get in a fresh green bone is completely different from the kind of Fletcher you get in a, in a, in a fossilized bone. So unfortunately this paper pays, pays no attention to that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       It just looks at road plans and says there was roadwork there. It must have been done by roadwork. I think it's very sloppy, very weak, and a, it's certainly not the answer. We can expect ongoing debate and that is, that is healthy. But this is not a strong case at all. So this points to the first evidence that we found and is there any effort underway to try to uncover more evidence from a similar 12 I'm going to cite to Tom. Tom Decorated the chief paleontologist San Diego Natural History Museum. That's what he would like to see. He makes the point to be I interview him. I said, I spent a day with him that actually steam museum. He was very generous with his time. I did an extended interview and I quote from it in in America before and his wish is that archeologists, instead of spending all that time trying to find ways to dismiss and get rid of his findings, his wishes that they would spend a little bit at that time looking at deposits older than 13,400 years and even being willing to go back as far as 130,000 years.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       That's, that's would be a proper scientific response. Here is a third body of work put forward by a very senior group of scientists who hesitated before they published it. They had the information back in the 1990s, but it wasn't until refined dating techniques later than in the 21st century that they finally were sure what they had and that they published it in nature in 2017. It's a, it's, it's a, it's an important study. Um, and I think what's going to happen is that we're going to find much more evidence of a very ancient human presence in the America America's, and that's what Tom Demorais thinks as well. Um, and as he points out, if we don't look, then we're never going to find, if we allow dogma to stop us looking and saying, well, it's impossible that humans were in the Americas 130,000 years ago, so we won't bother to look what a failure of science that is.

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       And, and, and to spend all the time instead of trying to get rid of the evidence that doesn't fit the current paradigm. It's so fascinating that just as fortuitous discovery during a construction site could change the way people perceive things. And you just got to wonder how much of that stuff is. And I mean, how deep did they have to go to find these mastodon bones? So this is a, this is a road cut that's being made. So those would be, does it be pretty deep down 10, 15 feet down the, the greater is going through it and, and flattening them. It varies from place to place depending on on soil deposition, the stratification, the stratification of the soil. But what the key, the key point is that what you need to do is go deeper than 13,000, 400 years ago and you need to do so with dedication and vigor and with some kind of funding.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       And at the moment archeology doesn't, uh, doesn't see the point of that. If the paper in nature by Tom Demorais was alone, if there were nothing else than that, uh, I wouldn't place so much trust in it. But I've spent a lot of time during the researching of this book with archeologists who dig, dig, dig, dig, dig deeper. And what those archeologists all confirm is that there have been human beings in the Americas for tens of thousands of years. And it's not surprising that that can be pushed back to 130,000 years ago. Because part of the argument about the peopling of the Americas has to do with a place that we now call the Bering straits between Alaska and Siberia, which during the Ice Age, where at times a land bridge, they were exposed because of, because of low at sea levels, but migrants who crossed that land bridge from Siberia on many occasions, over periods of tens of thousands of years would find themselves confronted then by the North American ice cap, which oddly wasn't at the tip of Alaska, but began further in.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       So there was living space in a bit of Alaska, but you couldn't get through the ice mountains. These, these literally ice mountains to two miles deep covering the whole of North America and preventing access to the unglazed created, uh, parts of America. The thing is that what happened around 13,400 years ago, there had been a period of global warming and the ice sheets began to melt and a corridor opened up between what's called the Cordillera and ice sheet and the Laurentide ice sheet, the two major ice keeps in North America and it's thought that the migration came through that corridor. Well, the thing is that exactly the same thing happened between 140,000 years ago and 120,000 years ago there was an episode of global warming, an ice free corridor opened up and the same opportunity to enter the Americas was there at that period than it was at the later period. And Tom Demaris point and mine is that we have to pay much more attention to that earlier period. And that's really why I've gone ahead and uh, and, and written this book is to try to put before a broad general audience, hopefully in, in language that, that, that makes sense and an assembly of all the latest information that casts doubt on the story we've been told. Because my goodness, if archaeology is wrong about the story of the peopling of the Americas, if

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       it's radically wrong as it now appears to be, then our whole understanding of human history has to change. It's not just the history of the Americas, it's the history of the entire world. It has been an absolute article of faith amongst archeologists that civilization began in the old world. And, uh, indeed, I have a, I have a book in my library called history begins at summa and it's by Samuel Noah Kramer are very renowned archaeologist. Uh, and it's a, it's a good book actually. But the argument is that this is where civilization began in the culture that we call the Sumerians in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and that it began about 6,000 years ago. And that civilization is entirely an invention of the old world that has nothing to do with the new world at all because of the new world was populated so late. This has, this has been the, this has been the argument and this is the argument that now radically and suddenly begins to change that the Americas, this enormous landmass resorts, rich, bountiful in, in every way south of Minnesota, south of the ice cap, vast land areas that are, that are bad.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       We'll get into South America, Central America, South America, the Amazon, just huge areas of land that were very, very offered. Great potential for human occupation. Dogma has said there were no humans there. Now the first bits of evidence are coming out that says there were humans there, and if that's the case, then we must consider the possibility that the story of civilization might've begun in the Americas, not in the old world at all. It might be a new world invention, not another word, adventure.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       Some of the more fascinating pieces of evidence in South America have come out recently about these channels and pathways that they've found in the Amazon that could not have been created any other way, but by humans creating irrigation, humans creating the, like, it appears like grids, like a city grid.

Speaker 3:          00:34:36       Definitely the Amazon is a colossal mystery and a, it's one of the subjects that I explore in depth in America before. First of all, to give some basic figures. The Amazon basin is huge. The Amazon Basin is 7 million square kilometers in area and within it, five and a half million square kilometers, uh, remains almost entirely unstudied by archeologists. And that's the five and a half million square kilometers that is still covered by dense rain forest. And to put that into perspective, five and a half million square kilometers is the size of the entire Indian subcontinent. So it's like saying we've done world archeology, but we've just ignored India. You know, we've done world archeology, but we just ignored the Amazon is the same at the same migrant five and a half million square kilometers. The view was, again, there was a dogma, there was a preconception, human beings couldn't have flourished in the Amazon.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       It's a, it's not a resource rich area. The soils are poor. Um, it's a difficult area, challenging to get to very far from the Bering straits. So the view was that humans hadn't entered the Amazon until about a thousand years ago. And then gradually, little by little, that view has begun to change and it's begun to change because of the tragic clearances of the Amazon. Because the Amazon rain forest is literally being cut down and turned into soya bean farms and cattle ranchers. And in that cutting down process has emerged things that shouldn't be there at all. Uh, for example, evidence that large cities flourished in the Amazon enormous cities, which were larger than the, there was a Spanish explorer who went down the Amazon River system in 1541 to 1542, he was the first European to cross the entire length of South America from west to east. Uh, along the Amazon, he reported seeing incredible cities, advanced arts and craft, millions of people, a thriving culture.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       Uh, and a hundred years later when other Europeans got into the Amazon, they couldn't find these cities. So they said, oh, Francisco, Arianna, that was his name, made it all up. It was just a, it was just a fantasy. And then in the last decade is the clearances at the Amazon have proceeded. We've begun to see the traces of those cities. What happened was that the Spaniards brought small pox into the Amazon. Smallpox devastated the local population because there was no immunity to it. There was a massive die off. The cities were deserted within a 50 years. They were completely overgrown by the jungle and that's why they were not seen by the explorers who came in a hundred years later. But now the youngest being cleared, those cities are emerging and we can say that, uh, a city like London, which had a population of roughly 50,000 in the 16th century, there were cities of that size all over the Amazon.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       Huge numbers of them and possible total population of the Amazon that exceeded 20 million people. Yes, 20 billion. This is the latest evidence from the Amazon. And then you ask yourself, how did they do that? How did they feed 20 million people in the Amazon? Because it's a fact rainforest soils are poor. It's one of the reasons these soya bean farms are really stupid idea. Because once you clear the rain forest, the land is largely unfair tile and you can't grow stuff on it for very long. So how did they feed all these people? The answer was they invented a soil and that soil has a name, it's called Tara Prater. Archeologists referred to it as Amazonian dark earth or Amazonian black earth. It's a manmade soil. It's thousands of years old. It's full of microbes that are not found in a joining soil. It's based around bio char. Uh, and you can take a handful of 8,000 year old terra prater and you can add it to barren soil and that soil will instantly become fertile. It's highly sought after in the Amazon and it explains how they fed these people. There was silence in the atmosphere to create this, well, this is something that's not understood. It's still not understood by social experts to this day is to how that was done. But it's one of many intriguing evidences, pieces of evidence of much higher a development

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       in the Amazon that it has been given credit for and have a kind of science in the, Jamie's got an image of it up there. So this is a, this is Tara. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Exactly. So was that done by burns? Did these controlled burns? They did. They, one way that it was achieved was, uh, was to do wet burning, um, of middens. They would be, they would be burned and smolder they wouldn't bend fiercely, which just produces charcoal. They would, they would burn and smolder. Um, and, and that by what is called biochar would result. And that's part of the fertility of the soil. But the mystery is the microbial content of the soil, which is completely different from the microbes in neighboring soils. And that's remains unexplained. So do they, what are the theories? Composting, some sort of advanced compost as some sort of, some sort of advanced composting.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       But again, what has not been explained is that Ma is the Mike microbial content of these soils. So they're there, first of all is an issue of how, uh, two things, how large populations get fed in the Amazon and evidence that there was a culture in the Amazon that was capable of manipulating the environment in such a way that it could support large populations with the invention of terror. Prater. Secondly, new evidence previously not recognized. The Amazon is basically a garden. The Amazon is a manmade rain forest. Uh, there are certain trees like Brazil nut trees or the ice cream bean tree, which are food crops, which are very, very valuable. And they dominate the, uh, the, the tree regime in the Amazon. They, what's what's referred to as hypo dominant species. In other words, people living in the Amazon over thousands of years selected certain trees which they then cultivated and grew.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       So the whole thing is not simply a wild, pristine rainforest. It's a very ancient manmade environment and emerging from that manmade environment as well as evidence of large cities, large populations, and this mysterious dark earth are huge geometrical structures. Um, and again, I go into this at length in America before because I love this mystery. We have in the UK structures that are called hinges. Um, I live in the city of bath and about 30 miles away there's a beautiful site called aviary and another more famous site called Stonehenge. And what a Henge is, is a ditch which has been dug deep and then an embankment has been pushed up outside the ditch. When people first saw these structures, they wondered if they'd been built for defense, but then it became obvious they hadn't been built for defense. Because if you want to create a moat, you put it outside your embankment, not insight.

Speaker 1:          00:41:13       You're in Bankman. So in a hand is an earthwork, which consists of a deep moat with a large embankment outside it and it can be circular, it can be square, and in the UK and other parts of Europe, it often contains stone circles, megalithic stone circles as well. But the Henge itself is entirely an earthwork. What we find in the Amazon are thousands of that are now beginning to emerge from the cleared area of the jungle and others that have been identified for the first time with Lidar, lidar technology is being employed in the Amazon. It's nondestructive. You can see what's under the trees. What does lidar, light imaging and detective radar, they mounts laser beams down into the jungle. This whole pattern of them, you need helicopters and they they, but it doesn't damage the rain forest and you can strip away and see what's, see what's there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       And if this is too much of that diversion. Let me give you the example of Guatemala. Guatemala is a small country, if I remember correctly. It's not much more than a hundred thousand square kilometers in size. Um, it is filled with intriguing Mayan ruins. Everybody has heard of teacol. Carl, what archaeal just didn't know was that literally within walking distance of teacol surrounding that whole area, we're more than 60,000 structures that they hadn't identified. And these have all been identified by lidar in a country that's just a hundred thousand kilometers in area. So you'll have to ask yourself in that five and a half million square kilometers of the Amazon, if lidar technology could be applied comprehensively, what would we find beneath there? And the evidence already is extremely tempting and extremely tantalizing and I'm intrigued by these huge geometrical figures, uh, which involve primarily a circles and squares and they are classic hinges in the sense that they are deep ditches surrounded by huge embankments.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       They're extremely geometrical. For example, you can find an octagon surrounding a square at a place called Jacko sa in the Amazon. You can find a square perfectly in closing a circle. Now that is an exercise called squaring the circle that are archaea are our academics have given to the Greeks. They said the Greeks were the first person people who perform that exercise. But now we find in dated sites in the Amazon that this was being done in the Amazon long before the Greeks. What are the dates? The earliest dates that have been found in these sites now are about three and a half thousand years old, about three and a half thousand years old. But the evidence is that the sites have been constantly remade. And what intrigues me is what remains in that five and a half million square kilometers that has not been investigated yet.

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       We are just, I think looking at the edges of a mystery, the archeologists involved to a mainly from Finland and also from Brazil feel the same. They're, their estimate is that there are thousands of these structures remaining in the jungle and they're open as to how old they may ultimately prove to be the investigation needs to be done. But what's fascinating about them is this very powerful geometry and astronomy. So a number of the sites are perfectly aligned to true north, true south, true east and true West. I'm not talking about magnetic north, I'm talking about true astronomical Doulas to do that. There's only one way to do it. And that's with, uh, with astronomy. So that tells us that astronomers were at work in the Amazon. The geometry is very complex and very precise. That tells us that people with geometrical skills, we're working in the Amazon. And thirdly, the scale of the sites of hundreds of meters, gigantic earthworks on the scale of hundreds of meters, tells us that this was highly organized project that was undertaken on a very large scale by very large numbers of people. It's a wonderful mystery and it deserves much further, much further attention. And I'm, I'm, yeah, that's Jacko sa. Exactly. The squares squaring the circle, so you can see the outside embankment and then inside it is the square ditch. And then there's another embankment inside that and a circle and a circle inside there.

Speaker 2:          00:45:03       Crazy. They made a road right through that modern road. Yeah. You know, because, because there's no respect for, there's no respect for the ancient, for the ancient world, unfortunately. And there's another one look at that. Wow, that's incredible. So that there are thousands of the sound, the stuff that they found in the Amazon. What imaging technology were they using to find

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       all initially, initially it was entirely found because areas of the rain forest had been cleared. Economic interests said, we want to make a cattle ranch here, or we want to make a soy bean farm here. So we're just gonna clear the rain forest. In the process of clearing the rain forest, they start discovering these earthworks that had previously been completely overgrown by the jungle. Then the next step was to say, uh, what can we, what can we do to find out more about this? Obviously they don't want to destroy more jungle. And Luckily we have a technology which is, which is Lidar, as I mentioned, which uses radar and using lidar. They'd been identified, able to identify many more of these sites and then to get to the sites without destroying the jungle and to begin excavations on them and to find that they go back in the cases of the ones that have been explored so far, at least 3000 years.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       Uh, this is an intriguing development, completely unexplained in our understanding of the Amazon. And what it suggests is a heritage of extremely ancient knowledge. You don't wake up one morning and you know, create a perfectly geometrical square or circular earthwork that's perfectly aligned to true north, south, east and West on an enormous scale. That has to be a background to that. That'd be a reason for doing it. And the evidence is none of these sites were lived in. There's no habitation, a refuse found in them whatsoever. They were, they, we don't know what they were used for. I make the case in America before that they're connected to a system of ideas which has found all around the world, which, which has to do with death and the afterlife, destiny of the soul. Uh, and I go into the issue of Iowasca, uh, in, in this book because I, first of all, I was, is itself another example of Amazonian Science.

Speaker 1:          00:47:07       Um, as you and I, and many of the listeners and viewers know, uh, the active ingredient of Iowasca is DMT dimethyltryptamine, but dimethyltryptamine is not normally accessible through the gut. We have to smoke it or, or vape it to get that rocket ship to the other side of reality and journey. Last Swat 10, 12 minutes. Not much more than that. Sometimes, sometimes quite a lot less. What [inaudible] does is it makes DMT available through the gut. The reason it's not available through the gutters because of an enzyme in the gut called monoamine oxidase. And that switches off DMT on contact, the Iowasca Vine, which is one of the two ingredients of the IOWASCA brew. The other ingredient is leaves that contain DMT. The IOWASCA vine contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which switches off the enzyme in the gut and allows the DMT to be accessed to orally, which produces a rather different journey from the smoked or vaped DMT trip.

Speaker 1:          00:48:08       It's a much longer journey. It's four or five hours. It allows you to integrate and to, and to interrelate with the strange landscapes in which you find yourself amongst and the entities that you encounter. I'm not making any claims about the reality status of those entities, but what I am saying, and it's a fact, is that people who work with DMT and Iowaska do encounter what they construe to be entities, uh, who, who communicate with them intelligently. So somebody in the Amazon out of 150,000 different species of plants and trees selected too that are not psychoactive on their own. But when put together, create an extraordinary visionary brew, uh, Iowasca means the vine of the dead and what it's connected to, uh, in South American religious and spiritual thinking, uh, is what happens to us when we die. Uh, and, uh, the Takano who are an Amazonian people who work regularly with Iowa Ska, I mean the Tucano actually will give a teaspoon full of Iowa Asca to a newborn infant.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       They feel I was so important that there is a hidden realm around us which we are not normally aware of and we need to be aware of it. And I ask it as an important part of that. In there I'll ask a journeys, the Takano schamens experience visions and they will then come back to an ilit normal problem solving state of consciousness. And they will paint and depict their visions. And what's intriguing, and I go into it in the book, is the quite a number of the Takano paintings of the other world, of the afterlife realm of the entrance to the other world are geometrical and they look exactly like the geog lifts. So I'm beginning to wonder whether these geoglyphs we're part of a system of spiritual ideas concerning what happens to us after death and what we need to do in this life to ensure a beneficial outcome.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       And oddly enough, that same system of ideas is found in the Mississippi valley, in the Amazon. It involves, uh, particularly Iowasca and the belief that the Iowaska journey takes you to the afterlife realm and a journey along the milky way in the Mississippi Valley. Um, the mound builder sites up and down the Mississippi Valley, particularly Mountville in Alabama, exactly the same system of religious ideas associated with geometrical constructions that on death the soul, they're very specific ascends to the constellation of Orion transits from the constellation of Orion to the Milky Way makes a journey along the Milky Way, which they call the path of souls and encounters challenges and ordeals where the soul must account for the life that it has lived. Then we got to Egypt and what do we find? The same system of ideas. The soul must rise up to the constellation of Orion.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       There's a narrow shaft cut through the southern side of the Great Pyramid of Giza, which targets directly the lowest of the three stars of Orion's belt, widely the accepted as a star shaft or a sole shaft. The soul would rise up through that shaft, get to the Constellation of Orion, which stands by the banks of the Milky Way, and would then transit to the Milky Way, which the ancient Egyptians called the winding waterway. And it would make a journey along the milky way where it would be confronted by challenges and ordeals very similar idea to the Takano very similar idea to the Mississippi valley as far as we know. None of these cultures were in contact with one another. Either. We're dealing with a huge, unbelievable, extraordinarily detailed coincidence involving architecture and ideas. Or we're looking at the legacy that was inherited in all of these different places from a remote common ancestor.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       And, and I believe that that's what we're looking at. What do we think the people from the ancient Mississippi Valley, that culture, what do we think they were using if they weren't using Iowasca or do we think that that's what they were using? Well, that's, that's, that's an interesting question. Whether, whether visionary substances are the only way to get into altered states of consciousness. And, and, uh, I would say they are definitely not a, of course there are visionary substances which are, which are used in native American vision, vision quests. I've, I've, I've had the privilege of Payoti ceremony, uh, with the native American church. I've never done that. What does that look like? I loved it actually. I thought, I thought it was, I thought it was amazing. It doesn't overpower you in the way that DMT or Iowaska does. Uh, it's, it's, it's much gentler.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       It's much more, you feel much more integrated and connected with, with, with nature. Your thought processes are quite, quite clear. It felt, it felt just like a very beautiful and healing experience. And I loved the ceremony that I'm in. I'm inside a teepee with, with 30 or 40 other people and that there, there are specific roles that are assigned to those different individuals. One, we'll keep the door, another will be responsible for the fire, which is a work of art in itself. Just gazing into that fire and the glowing, the glowing embers is enough to induce an altered state of consciousness on its own. Incredible drumming, which, which drives your state of consciousness into a kind of peak peak experience. This is a technology for accessing other levels of experience and other levels of reality. And it's clear that the native Americans had a number of advanced technologies in this area. The Sun dance doesn't use a substance, but it uses austerity. It uses pain to drive an altered state of consciousness. The objective in every case seems to be, let's just for a while, get ourselves out of the narrow, rigid frame of the Ilit problem solving state of consciousness. We all need that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       It's incredibly useful. Hunter gatherer is needed just as much as people in cities need it, but it's not the only state of consciousness available to human beings. And maybe that's one of the big mistakes that we're making in our culture, um, and was not made, uh, in, in shamanistic societies

Speaker 2:          00:53:43       that that is a really interesting breakdown that maybe that is one of the big mistakes we're making in our culture when people point to the problems that we have in this country. One of the problems we have is our inability to connect with each other or to recognize that we're all sharing this space and time together and instead wanting to uphold our own religious or ideological ideas as being the only one way to get going. Yeah. The only one way to get through. And one of the things that I've found, the psychedelic experiences, it really makes ideologies seem, uh, if not preposterous, at the very least insignificant in comparison to human experiences. The experience of, of comradery and friendship and love it, you realize like, oh, this is what's important. This is really about not enforcing your ideas are pushing them on other people and forcing people to behave the way you behave. But instead

Speaker 3:          00:54:38       I'm thinking about religious ideas, which caused so much division, so much chaos, so much hatred, so much fear, so much suspicion in the world today. Is it really what we want to do as human beings simply to accept a package of ideas that were believed in by our ancestors to accept them whole without question as absolute fact, which we regard as such a Thursday to fact that in some cases we're willing to be deeply unpleasant to people who hold different views or perhaps even killed him. Uh, we've had this, you know, this recent event in, in, in, in Sri Lanka or primarily a religiously motivated terrorist event that happens. It happens all over the world that people feel so convinced that the inherited package of ideas that they had nothing to do with creating and that they have never questioned. They're so convinced that those ideas are right, that in extreme cases they are actually prepared to kill other human beings who hold different ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:55:33       There are they so insecure in their own, in their own beliefs that that they're prepared to go to that level of actually murdering another human being. Who else? They're so threatened by the other beliefs that other human beings hold. So it's an abnegation of our responsibility as human beings, we should be questioning things. We should not be accepting packages of ideas intact, fully formed and using them to drive the way we behave towards one another. That was part of the human story, but we need to move on from that. I mean, it's a very dangerous situation in a very complex modern world with billions of human beings on the planet to have these kinds of energy's being generated were certain groups of people are saying, we are absolutely right and you are absolutely wrong. We are superior. You are inferior. This is a very, very dangerous path that we're, that we're on and it needs to be changed.

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       Personally, I know this is not a comment that will go down well with many people, but I am strongly opposed to nationalism. I don't, I don't see any virtue in nationalism. It is an accident of birth, which nation you were born in. It was nothing that you did for your own merit. You didn't earn that you were born by accident in, in a particular nation. Why should we automatically feel the other people who were born by accident in that particular nation has something special in common with us? And that we together are a group who are much more important than other groups of people. I've been privileged to spend my life traveling around the world, living with communities all over, over the world. And one thing that really comes across to me strongly, it should be a cliche and yet it's not, is that we are all one family.

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       That humans are intimately interconnected all around the world. That you can go to the remotest area of the Amazon jungle and find the same hopes, the same fears, the same dreams that we have in industrialized cities, shared by the hunter gatherers in the, in, in the middle of the Amazon. So our similarities as human beings and what we share in common at the emotional level and the level of love and at the level of heart are far more important than our differences that are defined by the nation or the political group in which we in which we grew up in. And when I, when I say I'm against nationalism, I need also to make clear that does not mean, and I hope I'm not taking out of context by others who are listening to this. That does not mean I'm in favor of world government.

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       I detest governments. That's another thing we need to grow out of. We don't need governments anymore. If we have them, they should have a very minimal role in our society. I think it's possible for the human race to relate as one family without leaders and governments who are exploiting the worst aspects of our character, the lowest common denominator of our society. Deliberately encouraging theaters and hatreds and suspicions what responsible leaders should be doing is encouraging love and unity and their failure to do that, in my view, disqualifies them from the leadership role entirely. And that's why I've often said I would not, I would like to see a situation in which no head of state can be appointed to that position unless he or she has first had 12 sessions of Iowasca. That would be the condition. Don't even bother applying for the job if you haven't done that and we have to be there where you have it and we have to be, we want to see that you're drinking every drop and we wanted an experience Sharman presence who's really going to guide you through the, through the journey. And I suspect that that would be a transformative experience for many of our political class and that they would start to question why they do what they do, why they exploit fears in order to magnify their own position. They'd start to question that and to wonder about a different destiny for humanity. But that's a dream. I guess it's not going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:59:11       Very, very, very well said and I couldn't agree more. My hope is that what you were saying and what we were discussing earlier about how the Internet is sort of a roaded our faith in many institutions

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       as being the only or the primary source of knowledge that I hope that that takes place globally in terms of the way we view government. Yeah. And that we do that your idea of like, I love what America stands for and what America stands for is kind of a nation. That's where people go to, you know, this is one of the more insidious problems with this idea of building walls and keeping people out and making it incredibly difficult to get here. The reason why I'm here is cause it was pretty easy to get here. Yeah. That's why I'm here. That's, that's the essence of America. A free and open society come here and do better. That's the whole idea behind it. I would hope that this idea of being able to just, if you want to do manner that you can anywhere in the world, this could eventually spread out.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       Yes. This is my hope. I believe it can spread out and, and um, you know, I see many signs of hope, uh, in, in, in America. Uh, America has become a big part of my life, not just because I wrote this book, but because I have children who are now living in America. I have a son and daughter in law who, who live in La. I have another son and daughter in law who live in Boston. America. I'm, I'm British. But America has become a very central part of my life and it's a fascinating and amazing country and it's been my privilege to travel thousands of miles across America, across many, many, many different states. And I, I love this country. It's a, it's a, it's an amazing place. Only in America could we see happening. What has happened with cannabis, you know, then the fact that at a, at a local level, individuals have got together, mobilized petitions, organized votes, and changed the law, change the law.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       Diff, literally stuck a finger up at central government and said, fuck off. This is none of your business. What I do with my consciousness in the inner sanctum of my own life is not the business of the state. That's a very American feeling. It's, it's something that you don't find often in other countries where the state is granted much more power and much more authority than it perhaps should be. Americans are naturally questioning of government authority and that has, that is what has led to the, uh, legalization increasingly legalization of cannabis, which is going to change the world in lots of ways. But then ironically at the same time, see the thing about democracies is that in order to get things done in a democracy, you need to persuade people of your point of view. So information becomes very important in, in democracies and information can be abused, people can be misled with information. They can be told that what they're receiving is the truth, whereas in fact, it's not the truth. And you can end up with a kind of dictatorship that the people have given their ascent to on the basis of, of false information. And frankly, I'd rather have a real dictatorship, which is, which is out in the open. And clear rather than one that has been subtly manipulated into through manipulating

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       the, the, the, the views of the, of, of the voters. But I am and remain enormously encouraged by America. It may seem like a trivial issue, but the fact that state by state cannabis is being legalized and that is resulting from a grass roots movement that this enormous change has been made either. It's ironic, it's strange that at the federal level, even though what eight states now totally legal for recreational, uh, 23, 24 states, legal, legal for medical use, that at the federal level, it's still a schedule one controlled, controlled drug. This is a huge state of dissonance that exists in America is going to have to put it right. What it says to me is that people can change things, people can get together at the local level and they can make a better world because there's no doubt that the cannabis laws were vicious and wrong and cruel and evil and ruined people's lives for, for decades. And it's people who've changed that it's not government has changed, that it's the people at the grassroots level in America is a country where that can happen. And I, I, I remain encouraged about about the role of the American people while often in despair about the role of the American state.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       Yeah, I'm encouraged as well. And you know, it's interesting Ben and Jerry release something yesterday, which is really our on four 20, I should say, which was talking about the drug laws in this country and talking about how many, it's really, really opening this, the, uh, the idea of like how unjust these laws were and how many of these laws targeted people of color and how many people who are white people have profited off of this and how many people are still in jail for crimes that they committed, you know, air quote crimes that are no longer crime, that are no longer crime and this is ridiculous. And then these, these records should be expunged. I see that California has made some steps in that direction. There has been some expunging of course. Well, we can only hope that also what, what opens up next is silicide been, is now going to be on the ballot.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       Absolutely. And when that opens up, I mean what you really think marijuana is a gateway drug? Well guess what it is if silicide been gets in. Yes. Because silicide can legitimately changed the world. It really, I mean I think marijuana can change the world and I really do think that cannabis has changing people's perceptions and making people more calm and friendly and yeah, and even the, what they talk about with paranoia. I welcome that. And the reason why welcome that is I think people are entirely too cocky. The, the life we live as bizarre as you could ever imagine a book and we're just accustomed to it because it's our day to day for granted. Marijuana removes those blinders and it really makes you understand that this is a strange, strange life. And these, a lot of these pitfalls and problems that we have in our society are due to fear and they're due to ignorance and their, their due to this, this lack of connection with each other. And cannabis and many of these other psychedelic drugs, they encourage this connection with each other, which is, I think what we need need.

Speaker 3:          01:05:16       It's, it's, it's certainly what we need and, and, and it's an aberration in human culture that we've created a society that demonize these substances and that made them illegal is it's a relatively recent thing. It's really just the last, the last hundred years. It's, uh, it's, it's a tiny part of the human story and yet we were so arrogant as a society that we could set aside thousands of years of human tradition and experience and wisdom working with the plant medicines. We just set it aside, turn them into criminal substances and say, we know everything. What a, what a huge and stupid mistake that is, um, on cannabis as a quote unquote gateway drug. It absolutely is in this sense that the legalization of cannabis is going to open the doors to, as you, as you say, to the legalization of, of psychedelics. Because what's happening is that the population is completely waking up to the fact that they have been bullshitted and lied to about cannabis for the best part of a century.

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       And once that dawns on people, the realization at a direct, personal level, here's this herb I love. I have been lied to, systematically misinformed by central government, uh, about this, about this herb that leads to questioning of everything that central government does. And so in that sense, it is a gateway to a questioning society. The psychedelics are different in that, in that Psilocybin, um, actually does lead you to question stuff. It leads you to really ask questions about, about everything, about your role in the world, about you as a person, about how you relate to other people and about the whole system on this planet and the beautiful, gorgeous planet that we, that we have and what we're doing to it. That that also enters, enters awareness. So it erodes confidence and authority. And it also roads, confidence and authority that doesn't have experiences that you've experienced.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       That's the part of the problem is that these people that are holding people back from these psychedelic experiences, they've never had them. They've never had it. They don't even know what they're rallying. That coming to it from a place of fear and prejudice, uh, there's simply accepting stuff that they'd been told without really thinking it through [inaudible] and examining it. And again, it's a failure of, of what human beings should, should be doing. We have to get, we have to get rid of this fear and ironically it's bad for them as well. It's bad for the people that are actually encouraging this, these laws to be enforced. Yes, it's bad for, it's bad for the whole of the whole of society because it is healthy for a, for a society where adults become self realized, individuals where they make their own responsible choices about their own lives, where they don't say, oh, government must make this choice for me.

Speaker 3:          01:07:51       That's the next step for humanity. We start, we need to start becoming our own leaders and making our own choices and that is, that is what's being revealed now that we're getting to the skull beneath the smile of the war on drugs. We are realizing that it's part of a big program of lying that has been about keeping people's minds closed down, not wanting free thinking. I've made this point several times, but our society is not against altered states of consciousness as such. Our society will allow big Pharma to make billions of dollars with drugs that alter consciousness like Ciroc, satin, Prozac, antidepressants, which in my opinion, having had some experience of them are amongst the most horrible drugs on the planet. They are very harmful, very dangerous drugs, but they're completely legal and they're encouraged with our system. Likewise, alcohol, very dangerous drug causes, fights, causes drunk driving accidents, leads to cirrhosis of the liver, completely legal and open.

Speaker 3:          01:08:46       Uh, society is not against altered states of consciousness as such. It's against particular kinds of altered states of consciousness that lead to questioning of the existing control system. That's what's, that's what's going on here, here, here. Well said. And as you know, I have my own story with, uh, with, with cannabis. Well, you and I had a moment. We had a moment which was, which was quite a life changing moment for me because I, if I may just rehearse a little bit of this for the audience. Um, in 2011, I had a series of Iowasca sessions, uh, in which it was shown to me that I was using cannabis completely wrong, uh, that it had become a dominant force in my life, that it was making me, you're speaking about paranoia. And I agree with your paranoia is a, is a useful thing if only to overcome it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:34       That it was making me paranoid that it was making me suspicious that I approached everybody around me in a state of suspicion. And I was shown this by Iowasca and given a very strong message, you need to quit cannabis. What I didn't realize at the time is that the problem was not cannabis. The problem was me, uh, that I needed to fix those aspects of myself before I could have a proper relationship with cannabis. So after that IOWASCA session, having smoked cannabis for decades, literally 16 hours a day, seven days a week, I quit. I quit for three years and then I'm on your show and we're sitting, we're sitting opposite. But in others we are now, and you asked me a question, um, are you still off the cannabis and that? And I say, well, I'm thinking of dipping my toes back in the water, at which point you produce a joint and we smoke it together.

Speaker 3:          01:10:24       First of all, after three years, your tolerance is way down on cannabis. So I got really stoned. I did listen to that interview back in. Somehow I held it together together brilliantly. You opened up and there was like a wave of information came pouring out of you. It was wonderful. It was a liberation for me. And what it said to me is it's time to go back to cannabis, but perhaps in a different way, it doesn't it. I need a different relationship with his amazing medicine and, and if I can forge that, if I can make that different relationship happen, then it can be a constructive and positive part of my life. And I can say definitely that that has been the case and that's excellent. And so it's all thanks to you, Joe. I probably would still be off cannabis if it hadn't been for that joint.

Speaker 3:          01:11:05       Well, I think people can develop these patterns of behavior that are destructive with anything, whether it's with alcohol or cannabis or sex or anything. People get, they get in ruts. Yeah. You know, it doesn't mean that the cannabis is bad. It means that you are on a bad mental path. Yes. You know? I mean, I'm not encouraging it for everybody because some people are genuinely, biologically it doesn't jive with them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The fundamental thing is we as adult human beings need to take responsibility for our own lives and our own decisions. And we need no Tom that responsibility over to governmental institutions, especially when it concerns something as intimate and personal as our consciousness. And, uh, my view is the ancient world had the right attitude to this kind of thing and the modern world does not. And that we can sit down and learn a lot from the ancient world.

Speaker 3:          01:11:56       A lot of people ask me, you know, handcuffed, you've been arguing that there's a loss. There's been a lost civilization in the, in the, in the human story. But what, what sort of civilization do you think it was? Well, one of the things I think is, was a civilization that use psychedelics. I think it was a civilization that emerged from shamanism but did not stay at the hunter gatherer stage. But that took the essence of shamanism and integrated it into a very different kind of civilization from our, uh, which pursued things in different ways. A lot of archeologists have said to me, but we don't find any plastic bottles from the ice age. That means there was no advanced civilization during the Ice Age. Well hang on, maybe an advanced civilization might have decided never to get involved in plastic in the first place. Maybe they would have been a clear choice not to make plastic.

Speaker 3:          01:12:41       Maybe they did things in completely different ways. Maybe they cultivated powers of the human mind that we dismiss and regard as completely, completely unimportant. You know, Woo Woo. Yeah. This is the thoughts about Egypt, correct? It's about about Egypt and, and, and, and about other things. I mean the specific example I give is above the king's chamber in the Great Pyramid are five further chambers and these chambers are rushed and floored with granite beams that weigh about 70 tons each and there are hundreds of them. And these 70 ton granite beams, which to put in context, a 70 ton beam is equivalent in weight to 35 large SUV loves these 70 ton granite beams have been elevated to a height of more than 350 feet above the ground. And carefully and precisely placed in position. It is very hard for archeologists to explain how that was done. Using purely leverage mechanical advantage, you can say, oh, and perhaps they built a ramp and and, and hold the stones up the ramp.

Speaker 3:          01:13:50       But then you have to confront basic laws of physics. You can't hold a stone weighing tens of tons up a slope that exceeds 10 degrees. Then you start doing the calculation. How long the ramp do I need with a 10 degree slope to get to 350 feet above the ground? And the answer is you need a fucking long round, which, which should still be there because not that it couldn't have been a sand ramp, I would've collapsed under the weight of those stones. It had to be as massive as the pyramid itself. So this begins to seem like an absurd idea. The, the, the idea that is foisted on us by archeology may be the idea that they regard as absurd, namely that psychic powers were cultivated by ancient civilizations, that they could use powers of the human mind that we have allowed to lapse. Maybe that idea deserves further consideration.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       Um, we have gone down a path of leverage and mechanical advantage. We used to relying on machines, but we hear anecdotal reports of people who have telekinetic powers who can move things with their minds of people who have telepathic powers on. Our automatic reaction is to just dismiss all of that because science says it's impossible. Um, B be B because a science regards consciousnesses as local to the brain and doesn't see how it can exert itself, uh, outside of that. But maybe we should open up to those possibilities that we're dealing with a very different kind of culture that used techniques that we have allowed to lapse. And maybe we could wake those techniques up again. Maybe the ability of human beings to do almost superhuman things is resident within all of us, but sleeping

Speaker 2:          01:15:24       well, it's pure speculation that they use some sort of a telekinetic power, but it's pure speculation, but it's absolute that they did something that we don't understand. If you think about the distance between us and the construction, just the modern accepted construction dates of the great pyramid. It's more than 5,000 years ago or close to 5,000 years ago. It's supposed to be about 4,500 years old. Yeah, that's really old. Incredibly incredible to think that someone back then could do something that would perplex us today with modern machinery and that somehow or another, they figured this out. It's almost like what they had done was leave behind something that was so stupendous, so monstrously impressive that it would transcend time and that you would have to look at it even thousands and thousands of years later and say, hey, like this, this defies conventional explanation. This is not assemble. And I've seen some of the conventional explanations of the construction of the pyramid, and they conveniently neglect those chambers above the king's chamber. They do. They conveniently neglect a lot of those massive stones. And it's because it's, it's one of those things you just go, oh, I don't know. What does this Jeremy, they're the, they're the chairs

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       about the above, the above the king's chambers and each one of those floors is consists of a row of 70 ton granite blocks that had been raised 350 feet above the ground and not only that but brought from Aswan in the south of Egypt, 500 kilometers south of the south of the Great Pyramid.

Speaker 2:          01:16:52       If there's any time in history where you could go in a time machine and go back and observe, would that be the time? I am just completely fascinated by the ice age at the moment. If you had one shot to go back and see what it was like in some place, you

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       wouldn't go to the construction of the Great Pyramids. I think right now where I'd go is 12,800 years ago in the beginning of the younger dryas just to see because I think that's where the whole human story changes. I think that's where we change tracks from one path to another path and following those cataclysmic events of the younger dryas between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, following those, the signs of civilization that we see emerging are not the beginnings of civilization there a restarting of civilization that had existed before the cataclysm. And for that reason, um, I would, uh, I would like to be present during that cataclysmic event, if only to satisfy myself that it was indeed a comet. You see, the, the, the one thing, there's no dispute about any more is that the younger dryas was a cataclysm, the Yukon. They can't argue about that. The, the, the, the megafauna that, uh, that, that die off, the disruption of human activity that takes place at that time, the huge climate changes.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       This was a cataclysm by any standards where the arguments still goes on is what caused that. What caused the cataclysm. I vote strongly for commit multiple fragments of a comet hitting the North American ice cap and hitting Greenland as well. But there are other researchers in the field, like my colleague Robert Schoch, who thinks that the sudden is more involved. This is healthy. This is very, very healthy that there should, we should be approaching this problem from many different perspectives and trying to figure out what the fuck cause this extraordinary event that occurs at a pivotal moment in the human story, the end of the Stone Age, the beginning of the Misa Lithic the end of the ice age, the beginning of the current age of the earth, and suddenly we see these signs of civilization appearing and in places like Gabelli, Tepi. Those signs already include highly sophisticated knowledge and that's why I feel we really need to investigate the Amazon.

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       There are, there are three places in the world which are really lacking in the investigation right now. One of them is the Amazon five and a half million square kilometers, very little archaeology done. Another is the Sahara desert, the Sahara desert, tough place to work. I can understand why there's little archaeology done there, but the Sahara desert was green during the ice age. It had a completely different climate regime. We should consider the possibility that missing parts of the human story are there. And then under the continental shelves, because sea level rose 400 feet, these are three domains that archeology has largely not investigated. And, and it is largely not done. So they say, well, why would we spend the money on marine archeology? It's much better to spend it on looking for shipwrecks rather than looking for signs of a lost civilization because we archeologist, no, there was no lost civilization. So that's the argument for the resources there. And, and the same, the same with the Amazon. And the same with the, with, with the Sahara desert places in the very places in the world that those amongst us who are charged with the responsibility of interpreting the past have not looked at, are the very prices we should be looking at. I have a thought once while I was under the influence

Speaker 1:          01:20:09       and it was um, a thought that one day computational powers will reach a point where they will be able to take into consideration all of the objects on earth and what we know about the history and the vividly recreate the past through, through computation to the point where you could actually know who did what when people did things and that at man, I don't even know if this would be physical today, certainly not be possible, but with the exponential increase in computational power and technology and innovation that one day we'll reach a point where you'll be able to watch, you'll be able to see what happened and they'll be able to recreate what happened exactly. And that this would be something that would be, it's impossible for us to imagine that someone would be able to do that right now. But that one day with technology as it gets more and more advanced and we will reach some sort of, uh, some innovation or some sort of an invention that will allow us to go back and see, literally see what, what happened, how things were done.

Speaker 1:          01:21:19       Tech technologies is changing. Our whole understanding of the past and what you're envisaging is perfectly possible. We will, we will come to a time if 100 years, 500 times less if, if we don't, you know, first destroy ourselves entirely as a civilization. We will come to a time where our cleverness and our techniques will allow a much wider opening up of the past then his presently happened, but it is already happening. Um, one of the areas of science that I go into in America before his genetics and DNA, uh, this is an area of science that, uh, was not much informing archeology until about the 1990s. But since the two thousands has become very important in archeology because the technology has been developed where ancient DNA can be extracted and tested and you can actually genotype an entire individual from DNA that may be 15, 20,000, 20,000 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:22:16       Um, and this, uh, new technology of genome sequencing and, and DNA is another factor that is raising huge question marks over the past of the America's. And one of the issues I go into a in this book is the presence in the Amazon rain forest of a very specific, clearly identifiable pattern of DNA, which is only found in one other place in the world. And that is in Australasia, uh, in Papua New Guinea and amongst Australian aborigines, it's Australasian Dna. Uh, now South America, not only in South America, but in the depths of the Amazon rain forest amongst tribes who have only been contacted in the last 20 or 30 years. Uh, and further, more, although skeletal remains

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       are rare, it has been found in ancient skeletal remains that are close to 11,000 years old in the Amazon. So that tells us that this DNA signal has been in the Amazon for at least 11,000 years. The geneticists think that it came to the Amazon during the last ice age. And this raises a huge mystery because the peopling of the Americas is supposed to have occurred from Siberia across the Bering Straits, down through that ice free corridor into North America, down through North America, into South America, into Central America, and finally into South America. If that was the whole story, then we would find this DNA signal in North America and in Central America. We would not find it only in the Amazon. When I talked to some of the leading geneticists about this, but specifically, um, Escott professor, SK Willis level at the University of Copenhagen has been the lead author in a number of major studies of Ancient Dna.

Speaker 3:          01:24:02       And I asked him, what do you make of this Australasian Dna, uh, in, in the Amazon? And, and he said, honestly, we don't have a proper explanation for it at, at the moment. But what he did say is that the most parsimonious explanation, he used that specific word, the most parsimonious explanation is that a group of people during the ice age crossed the Pacific Ocean and settled up and ended up in South America and settled in the Amazon and brought their DNA with them. That would account perfectly for the DNA data. And when a scientist says the most parsimonious explanation, what that scientist is saying is he likes that explanation that it's a simple, direct, clear explanation of the DNA mystery. But then he added, however, it doesn't make practical sense. And I asked him, well, why doesn't it make practical sense? And he said, because the archeologists tell me that no human population was capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean during the ice age.

Speaker 3:          01:24:57       At which point it was natural for me to say, do you really trust the archeologists? And he said, well, in science we do trust the work of other scientists. We don't really question it. We don't really investigate it. That's their side of the, their side of the business. Um, and, and my, my view is that that is rather than rather than excel, rather than taking this weird anomalous Austra Lazy and Dna Signal, uh, in the, in the, in the heart of the Amazon, uh, as something to be explained a way and as something to be for it to be denied, that it could, it could be connected to a voyage across the Pacific Ocean. Maybe it's the first compelling evidence that voyages were taking place across the Pacific Ocean during the ice age. And maybe we should be opening up that whole issue for exploration. And again, I think I lost a lost civilization is the best answer.

Speaker 3:          01:25:47       And that near the end of the ice age when, when the younger dryas cataclysm unfolds, it's not an overnight thing. It's very bad. 12,000, 800 years ago, there's about 1000, 200 years of horror. I don't think the civilization went down in a single day and night. I think there were survivors, I think bits of it were left. I think their project was to restart civilization. And I suggest very strongly that where they tried to mount that project was amongst the hunter gatherers who coexisted in the world with them at that time. We ourselves are an advanced civilization, at least that's what we call ourselves. And we coexist in the world with hunter gatherers. Uh, it's not an odd idea that an advanced civilization, a hunter gather as should coexist and there is separation between us and the Amazonian hunter gathers. There are tribes in the Amazon that are uncontacted and that we, that we don't know even exist if catastrophe on the level of the younger dryas were to occur today.

Speaker 3:          01:26:49       I don't think that our civilization would make it through. We are the spoiled children of the earth. We are just used to having everything laid on. You know, the supermarket shelves are groaning with, with food. We can get food delivered to our homes. We have roofs over our head. We have shelters, we have coding. Everything is taken for granted. I guess you an exception. But very few people in modern western culture know how to survive. They don't have survival skills. They don't know how to hunt. They don't know how to gather. They don't know how to grow crops because they've handed that responsibility over to others. We live in a society that's highly segmented and specialized in different people specialize in different things, but nobody has the vast general survival skill that a hunter gatherer has. So in a global cataclysm, actually at first counterintuitively, the people who would survive it would be the hunter gatherers and an advanced civilization would be smart if they were survivors to seek refuge amongst hunter gatherers, uh, to, to make that the place where they might try to start, restart their civilization.

Speaker 3:          01:27:51       And that's why I think that this Austria Lazy and DNA signal in the Amazon may be part of the evidence for a sort of outreach effort that was being made by a lost civilization. Seeing the disaster coming down on it and realizing that something needed to be done well, it's fascinating to me that the geneticists would rely on the archeologists being that the geneticists have the actual DNA, they can examine where the archeologists are piecing things together. Absolutely tiny bits of information over the entire landscape. And then you consider how much information they don't have access to that's in the ground. Exactly. I, I strongly resist the idea that archeology is a science. I don't think it should be described as a science. What do you think it should be described? It's more like a kind of philosophy. It's a, it's, it's a, it's an attempt to interpret the past, uh, based on rather flimsy and limited evidence.

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       And what you find in that interpretation is that the preconceptions of the individuals involved are being imposed upon the evidence, which then turns out to support their preconceptions. And that's not a scientific way of doing things. A scientific way of doing things is testing, testing hypotheses and false seeking to falsify them and seeing if, if they, if they work out. So the problem is drawing these conclusions and then being too rigid with these conclusions on the further evidence. That's, that's my view that, that, that archeology has been, has been much too rigid and, and the, and that there's a, there's a climate of fear in archeology. I don't mean to pick particularly on archeologists here, I think this is generally true across other disciplines as well. Um, these days academics are driven by the need to publish research papers. That's what they build their careers on.

Speaker 3:          01:29:32       If they can get a paper on their bit of research published in nature of the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, et Cetera, that's good for their careers. But then you confront the gatekeepers in those publications who regard any archeological idea that is not part of the mainstream accepted consensus with great suspicion and are most most reluctant, uh, to, to, you know, to publish, to publish that information. Now, what is the mainstream, what, when, when archeologists talk about seafaring humans, when, what, what did they date that too? Well, there's the great, the great seafaring adventure that is accepted by archeology is called the Polynesian expansion. And it's a remarkable story. And that occurs roughly 3000 to 3,500 years ago. And those Polynesians were amazing ocean navigators. They could, they could cross distances of thousands of kilometers with pinpoint accuracy. I mean, it's not an accident that the Polynesians found Easter island fighting Easter island is a really challenging project.

Speaker 3:          01:30:36       Easter island is 2000 miles from the coast of South America. It's 2000 miles from the nearest other island, which is Tahiti. It's just a little speck in the middle of the ocean. But the Polynesians found it and settled there and appear to have brought a reproductively viable population there and appear to have made voyages back and forth. But that was 3000 to 3,500 years ago. That was not 12,800 years ago. Uh, and this is, this is where archeology is adamant position that ocean voyaging was begun by the Polynesians and that there was no major ocean voyages before. That I think needs to be strongly questioned and it needs to be strongly questioned in the light of this DNA evidence from the Amazon rather than rejecting the evidence and attempt should be made to consider what that might mean. Well, it's interesting because we know that the Egyptians had boats.

Speaker 3:          01:31:25       Yeah. And so what I mean, if there were boats 4,500 years ago, why do we think that they didn't try them out in the ocean? That doesn't make any sense. Especially if there existed a thousand years prior, which is also possible. Archeologist wouldn't argue that the Egyptians had boats, but, but that is, that is still within the framework of accepted history. It's, it's the notion of a, of a global navigating culture in the ice age that archeologists can't swallow. It's a subject that I've kept on coming up against over a number of years. I think the best evidence for it is ancient maps, uh, which show the world as it looked during the last ice age. I've first explored this in fingerprints of the gods and I've touched on the mystery again and I haven't had an appendix on the subject in, in, in this book because I think these are very important.

Speaker 3:          01:32:11       We're talking about maps that were drawn roughly between the 13 hundreds and the 17 hundreds. Uh, in other words, in relatively recent history, however, these maps were largely based on much older source maps, which they copied. And we can say that for sure because one of the famous maps is the period [inaudible] map which was created by a Turkish admiral called Perry Reece in the year 1513. Uh, actually only a corner of his map has survived. It was originally a world map. We now just have a bit that shows the east coast of South America and North America and the west coast of Africa. Peary Reece writes in that map that it is in his own handwriting that he based it on more than 100 older source maps, some of which had come from the library of Alexandria. In other words, that maps had been when the library of Alexandria had been destroyed in the fourth century idea whenever it was, some of its contents had been rescued and brought to Constantinople, which became the Turkish capitol and Peary Reese had access to those maps and he incorporated information from those maps on his maps as well as incorporating more recent navigational information.

Speaker 3:          01:33:19       And this is one of a whole category of maps which are extremely hard to explain. All of them based on older source maps. Now lost all of them. Incorporating extremely precise relative longitudes and latitudes. Latitude is not that difficult to technological feat, but longitude is a difficult technological feat. Longitude involves a chronometer. It involves knowing the time at the place you began, your voyage and the local and local noon as well. And calculating the difference between them. You need a chronometer that we'll keep accurate time at sea with the Mo motions of a ship. And it's just a plain fact that our civilization did not invent such a chronometer until the late 18th century. Before that we didn't know what longitude where we were at. And ships were constantly sailing unexpectedly into coastlines that they thought were hundreds of miles further away. So the discovery of the technique to do longer chewed was a major civilizational advance.

Speaker 3:          01:34:13       Its presence in maps based on much older source maps that actually show the world as it looks during the last ice age suggests that somebody during the last ice age was mapping the world and had mastered the technique of calculating a longer shoot. Classic example of these maps. Um, and I make a point of this is what's called the Pinkerton world map, which was drawn in the year 18, 18 and it was based on the latest navigational information at that time. I reproduce that map in the, in, in the book. What's missing from the map entirely missing is Antarctica. There's just a hole at the bottom of the world. There's nothing there. And the reason, there's a reason, there's nothing, there's another, there's another Pinkerton map that uh, that shows that the, the reason that you need to find one that's centered on Antarctica, the reason, the reason that Antarctica is not there is that our civilization hadn't discovered Antarctica in 1818 so they couldn't authentically put it on a map in 1818.

Speaker 3:          01:35:18       Actually we discovered it in 18, 19 and that's when it starts appearing on modern maps. The problem is that Antarctica repeat appears repeatedly on these much older maps and it appears in the right place, uh, and a bit bigger than it is today, but very much as it looked during the last ice age. So what all of this suggests to me is that the world was mapped and explored by a global seafaring culture with the level of technology that was at least equivalent to ours at the end of the 18th century. Uh, during the ice age. Wasn't there also a map of Greenland that showed it underneath the ice? Yes, there are. And, and, and, and, uh, another intriguing thing I met, I mentioned the Peary Reece map just now shown on the Perry Reece map lying off the east coast of North America is a large island with a row of megaliths, like a road of megaliths running up the middle of it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:11       Um, that island is in the exact place of the Grand Bahama banks. Uh, and, and uh, just one. Yeah, it is. Um, but can I point it out to you because I'm sure that's right. Okay. That one. Okay, that's great that you can bring this up Jeremy. So this island is sitting there off the southeast coast of North America. I think we have these to dry things back then too. And what you see running down the middle of it is this road like feature of our main list. I see right there. Now the thing is, it was a long period of my life when I, I did a lot of scuba diving and I was looking at an underwater structures and one of the sites I dived on was the Bimini road, which is in the Grand Bahama banks. And the remedy road is exactly where the island is and the that.

Speaker 3:          01:37:03       Here's the issue. I don't care whether the Bimini road is natural or manmade. For me, the mystery is that it is shown above water on that map. And the last time it was above water was thousands and thousands of years ago. So for me, this is all evidence that we shouldn't dismiss the possibility that our ancestors had achieved a level of technology where they could explore in that the world's oceans. We shouldn't dismiss that. We don't know what those stones are, how they were created, but bully. Do they look artifacts you on a Goonie and Japan we're looking at now, but the back to that image to me did the last image that we were just looking at it. Look at that. That looks so man man. And you can see that as rather like the, the, the pattern that's showing on the, on the island in the, in the map. How deep is that today? Oh, it's not very deep. It's about 20 feet. There's, but we think that that was above water at some point. This trip was definitely above water during the last ice age when it, when finally went underwater.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       May have been as late as eight or 9,000 years ago. Is there anything else compelling that's in the immediate area that seems to indicate that there was some sort of a manmade structure? Well, nobody's looked for it. Uh, and the whole effort of archeology has been to dismiss the significance of the BIM and a row. How would they dismiss that? Well, they say it's just, to me they say it's totally natural. Comma is go, go back to that image again. This, but, but well this is the og. You go back to that image that we just saw. Yeah, sure. Somebody who spent a lot of time diving on the Bimini road. I can tell you I absolutely do not think it's natural. I think it's a manmade structure, but the argument is that it's a kind of beach rock that forms in these blocky for me is that a speech rock does form in Bocky permission.

Speaker 1:          01:38:35       But here I believe that the beach rock has been used as a construction material. But I repeat, the key issue is not whether the Bimini road is manmade or not. The key issue is that it features on the map above water. And that is a dating project that tells us that somebody was mapping that bit of the world when it was above water. And that takes us back a very long, a long way into the past. The one that you just pulled up, you know, look at that one. That's a stunning place. It's this amazing site. It's just like the odds of that being in that order with those uniformly sized rocks for how long has that Oh, hundreds of feet. It's, it's a huge, it's actually shaped like the letter j. It's a giant underwater structure. It's really, really an enormous thing and very, very beautiful dive on and there's lots of very gentle sweet nurse sharks down there that you can play with it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       So that looks much more like random. That's more random and bits of it, bits of it do look more random bits of it look highly constructed. I would not, I would not seek to to claim that the Bimini road is absolutely manmade. My claim about the Bimini road is, it's really fucking weird that it appears on a map above water, a map that was drawn in 1513 based on older source map. Now when they found that ancient Greek uh, computer thing and what, what does that call Denton Kai Theora mechanism? Yes. Again, that testifies to a lost navigational skill that we have not taken account of incredibly complex and it took a long time for them to figure out what that even is. What do they think that is now? Um, it, it tracks the movements of the planets. It's a, it's a navigational device. It's a, it, it, it, it's a geared cogged system that allows you to track the passage of time and figure out where you are.

Speaker 1:          01:40:18       It's, it's some kind of navigational devices not fully understood. And how old is that? I think that goes back to Greek times. I'm guessing here because the Greek times are not of great interest to me, but I'm thinking around about 500 BC. So at least 2000 years old. 2000 plus. And we know that there had to be more than one of these things. Yes. It, you can't, you can't have something like that without, without a vast effort behind it. Human beings, we're working on creating this geared and cogged machinery, uh, that, that reflected the patterns that are recreated. That's a recreation. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       Do you keep I one of those, it looks like you buy that dude fine. Bookmark that. We need one right there, right next to the plastic cells. And so such a thing is a is a cultural artifact which doesn't just appear out of nowhere. It hasn't, it has to have a context. It has to have a background. And again, my suggestion would be perhaps a secret technology. It's very odd that very few of these have been found and it may be that ship owners and navigators in Greek times, we're extremely careful about who they shared this technology where of course it made, they may, it may have been as top secret as you know, nuclear power is in, in, in our world today. Oh, that makes sense. But the fact is that then we have to, we, it exists. It's real, it's there and then we must consider what's behind it.

Speaker 3:          01:41:45       What, what led to that? Is that just the latest manifestation of something that that goes much more deeply back into human, human culture? And I think that is, I think, I suppose my main, my main messages that we have, uh, so far untold backstory that we're concentrating entirely on the front story and the backstory is missing, very largely missing from the picture. And what I've tried to do is to fill in bits of the backstory. Do you have anything in this book about the Omex? No, not really. Um, I, I mentioned, I mentioned them briefly. Uh, I explored the old Mac mystery, uh, in considerable depth can explain that to people maybe in the fingerprints of the gods. A yes. So it's considered to be the earliest high culture of Central America. Everybody's heard about the Aztecs, everybody's heard about the Maya. But before the Aztecs and before the Maya, there were a culture who are referred to as the old Max.

Speaker 3:          01:42:42       Again, we don't know what they called themselves. That's what the Aztecs called them. They called them the old Mexican. It means the rubber people because they see a rubber producing area of, uh, of Mexico. They worked in a giant megalithic constructions that what they're most famous for is these huge carved human heads, which can be on a scale of up to 20 to 25 tons in weight, uh, and, and which have curious features which have been interpreted variously as Polynesian African don't look like classic native American features. But one of the things, one of the things I've realized is that there is no classic native American feature that that native Americans are a very, have a very complex genetic story with very many different elements brought into it and we shouldn't be necessarily surprised by the supposedly non native American look. These are my kids. They do.

Speaker 3:          01:43:38       We think those helmets where they're wearing nobody knows because no physical example of such a helmet has ever been found. Just like no physical example of an Egyptian Pharaohs hell a crown has it has ever been found. All we see is the stone. The stone reproductions of them do. They're universally wear these helmets and they say all day. They pretty much all wear these helmets in, in, in, in the ALMAC stonework. There's another fascinating figure from La Venta when one of the Omex sites, which is the earliest ever image of a plumed or feathered serpent. The feathered serpent is a famous icon in Central America, quite sal collateral, who's the god of peace, the bringer of civilization who is associated, for example, with the famous pyramid of, of Cookwell con, which is just another name for quite awhile, Catholic church, Anita, where on the spring equinox, a shadow effect creates the image of a serpent coiling down the stairway and joining with the carved head of the serpent or the bears, the image from La Venta.

Speaker 3:          01:44:40       That's the earliest image of a plumed serpent in the Americas. And sitting in the middle of it, and I made a big deal out of this cause I think it is a big deal in magicians of the gods sitting in the middle of it is this human figure who's holding this strange bag in his hand. And it's just a fact that those identical bags are found in ancient sooner in the hands of individuals who were considered to be civilization bringers. And they also show up on pillar 43 at Gabelli Beckley Tepi, I call the man bags. Uh, and in that case it got back to the Tempe. We know they're at least 11,600 years old. So I wonder if we are looking at a sort of badge of office of a group of civilizes who traveled around the world trying to bring back to life a lost civilization and pass down.

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       I deploy a concept in this book that I actually got from Richard Dawkins. Richard Richard Dawkins is the author of the book called the selfish gene. And he's not one of my favorite people because he's a, he's a materialist reductionist and he doesn't believe in spirit or, or any mystery in life that were just accidents of chemistry and biology. We also has no psychedelic experience. And he said no, I did challenge him at a public event to, to go to go have a dozen sessions of Iowasca and its still gas at once or just once would be enough. But he has an excellent out because, uh, and sadly he's had a, he's had a stroke so he has a good excuse for not for not doing that, but he's a clever man. And one of his concepts that he's introduced into human culture is the concept of the meme.

Speaker 3:          01:46:05       We're off, I think familiar with that word. Genes are a physical reproductive mechanisms. They reproduce themselves down the generations they replicate, they multiply their passed on from one individual to another. Memes are cultural objects, cultural ideas that are passed on and replicate and reproduce themselves and what I see right across the Americas and right across the old world as well is a set of memes that involve the sky, that involve the ground, that involved geometry, that involve notions of life after death, and I think the only way to explain these is that they have been inherited from an earlier culture that was in some way connected with the ancestors of all of these, all of these cultures. I think that's what we are looking in the Amazon. We're looking at a meme which was deliberately created. Once you mobilize the population to start creating huge geometrical structures, you are also facilitating many other possibilities that an organized population allows.

Speaker 3:          01:47:03       I think that's what happened at got Beckley Tepi. I think that's why they created the Megalithic site there to mobilize the local population of hunter gatherers, to give them a project to do, to engage them and in the process of engaging them to teach them the skills of agriculture which were, which, which are fundamental to any concept of, of civilization. And it's weird the way agriculture just suddenly appears in in Quebec, the tappy and there's huge agricultural mysteries in the Amazon as well. Um, may I share a couple of leaves messages with you before you do that though? Can you pull up that image from Gabelli? Tapi of pillar was the pillar 4,343 in enclosure day. I would like to see that that guy holding that bag. That is, the bags are in a row along the top of the pillow. Um, it's pillar 43 in, in an enclosure d at go back to the Tempe.

Speaker 3:          01:47:56       Is there a, an image of that online? It's available. Okay, here we go. Yeah, there's the bags in a row and a row along the top as the same sort of square shaped bag with a curved handle that you find on the earliest image of the pillar of the feathered serpent. And that you find, no, you have to go above that, Jamie. Um, just a little bit higher up the pillar. That was Max, right, right, right at the top there. It's odd that this symbol crops up in, in many different cultures and tends to be associated with some kind of interpretation of those. There's no mainstream interpretation of those bags. That's my interpretation of those bags, uh, which I, which I freely confess. That's how, that's how I read them. I'm intrigued by the anomaly that the similar bag and turns up in the hands of the quite so collateral figure and turns up in Mesopotamia repeatedly, um, in, in the hands of the individuals who are called the App Kalu the, the, the magicians of the gods, the beginning bringers of civilization, the plume serpent [inaudible] Quadel was, it's an Aztec card, right.

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       And quest quest of collateral is an Aztec is an Aztec God. But, but the Aztecs acquired him from earlier cultures. The very fact that an image of the plumed serpent is given such priority in all met culture tells us that that system of ideas was present during all Mac Times, which takes us back at least to 1500 BC probably quite a bit earlier than that. Where's the Aztecs are 1,580. So there's 3000 years between the Aztecs and the Olmecs. And that same system of ideas is running through all of those cultures. And the Mayans had a name for it as well. Cool. Cool. Con and what do you think that plumed serpent was? I think he's the, it's very clear from, from the accounts that have survived that what he's associated with a two things in PR in particular. One of them, he's a god of peace.

Speaker 3:          01:49:39       He's not a a war God. Uh, and the, and the other thing that he's primarily about is giving the gifts of civilization. This is what you, human beings need to know in order to move on to the next level. Uh, that is, that is the function and the role of quite our collateral. And it's there are very similar, we could refer to them as civilizing heroes who are found in other cultures and other locations, or Cyrus in Egypt plays that role, uh, as a bringer of civilization. There's hardly a culture in the ancient world that doesn't remember a time far back in remote prehistory when some kind of supernatural or advanced human beings. And I prefer the latter. That's some kind of advanced human beings. We're involved in a project to disseminate a civilization. I mentioned the Chicano in the Amazon who, who are big drinkers of, of, of Iowasca.

Speaker 3:          01:50:39       Uh, the Takano have a fascinating origin myth. Uh, they say that they're an origin myth state specifically that their ancestors were brought to the Amazon. They were brought to the Amazon by a group of supernaturals who included the daughter of the sun and an individual called the helmsmen who steered the serpent canoe in which this settlement mission in the Amazon was, was performed. And what these so called supernatural dead was, they brought the ancestors of Decano to the Amazon and they showed them the best places to settle the best places where they, where they might find hunting the best places where they might create a village of the best places for agriculture. And then they left, but they left them behind one gift and that gift was Iowasca. Wow. That's the story of the origin myth of the Takano. And it sounds to me rather like the other side of the story of that DNA signal in the Amazon that a group of people were deliberately settled, uh, in the Amazon by human beings who they chose to regard as a supernatural. That's what makes sense of it to me. Um, when I interrupted you to talk about what's, or what were you about to say? I can't remember. I'm in California. I've been smoking dope.

Speaker 3:          01:51:54       We were talking about different things in the Amazon. Should we rewind? We said the serpent. God, you were talking about before quite so. Quantile before that. Um, I have another question. The omex did you, you were talking about the genetics of these, um, uh, people that live in native Americans that they vary widely, but the old mex seemed to have very similar features, the thick lips and noses. Why do we think that is? Well, this is part of, uh, a curious mystery that is not unconnected to the genetic mystery. Uh, it's been known by archeologists for quite a long time that there are anomalous skulls, uh, in parts of Brazil, which appear to show a very strongly Polynesian or African features, very much like the features that we see on the, on the all make heads. And a number of archeologists who got into trouble with their colleagues for this have used that to argue many years ago, 30, 40 years ago, that, that the settlement story of the Americas is much more complicated than we've, you know, then we, than we've realized and, and what the, what the DNA is doing is it's telling us that there was something really weird happened, happened with settlement.

Speaker 3:          01:53:12       They, you see, what happened with those, um, African or Polynesian looking skulls was that they were tested for DNA. Uh, when DNA technology was not as advanced as it is today. And what that DNA showed was that they were more closely related to modern native Americans than they are to any other people in the world. So the notion that there was some connection with Polynesia or Africa was dismissed, but now that we have very firm evidence of an Austrian lazy and genetic signal or Australian aborigines, Papua New Guinea Melanesians with those kinds of features, now that we have the genetic evidence that is found in the amps and we have to go back to that old evidence and reconsider it. Wow. Yeah, I would love to find out what that is. They've always fascinated me. The OMEX, it's always been such a strange image. The, the large heads with the helmets on them.

Speaker 3:          01:54:09       And how did they universally look like that? I mean all the, all of the features are very, very similar. They're very similar with the helmets and almost always, I won't claim that every single Omac head has a helmet on it. Cause I think I've seen one that didn't, there's quite a while ago since I explored the Almac area. But what's fascinating about them is they are, they are supposedly the first high civilization of Central America that they create structures on a massive scale that you can see connections between them. And the later, the later Maya, that whole mystery of the Mayan calendar was clearly inherited from the all Max. It wasn't something that Maya made up. The all max use that same symbolism. So the Mayan calendar is actually an Almanac calendar. And if we then consider the possibility that the all macs may just be the latest, the earliest surviving manifestation of that calendar, it could go back much further than that.

Speaker 3:          01:55:01       Do you plan on having any debates with people that oppose these ideas? Um, well it was interesting on your very show, Joe too, to have the debate that involved Michael Shermer, who's the editor of the skeptic magazine and um, some colleague of his who came in on line who I got a bit annoyed with, um, and um, myself and, uh, my great friend and colleague, the genius Randall Carlson, uh, and, and I felt that that was a very useful debate. Um, I felt that it's poss possibly the first time that those of us on the alternative side of the argument about history where we're given an opportunity really to put our evidence forward and, and to confront so-called skeptics while it's so cold. That's what he calls himself, Michael Shermer with this evidence. And obviously I'm biased, but I, I don't feel that he fielded the situation particularly well.

Speaker 3:          01:56:00       I don't think mainstream mark LG came out of that looking really good. I think it came out of that looking rather ignorant and uninformed. Uh, and, and a man like Michael Shermer, who is a professional skeptic, uh, cannot begin to match the knowledge of a man like Randall Carlson who has devoted his whole life to walking the walk of the geology of the end of the ice age in, in, in North America. And that showed on, on, on that debate. So I think the debate was worth doing a, I think it showed that the alternative side isn't just wishy washy stuff out there on the fringes of things, that there are those of us working in this field who are using really solid information. And who are who our project is to rewrite history and we're not going to do that with slight information. It has to be solid information. I think we had the opportunity on your show to say that, that that solid information is there.

Speaker 3:          01:56:54       I'm not claiming it was a complete victory for the alternative side. Michael Shermer is a smart guy and he put forward some good arguments to, and there were constructive aspects of that debate, which I, which I appreciate it. I'd like to see much more engagement and much more positive approach. I wished the skeptics welcome to their skepticism, but I wish they'd be less hateful, less less full of derision, less, less despising, or they're so defensive with their ideas and and so and so defensive with their ideas when the possibility is there for, for a constructive debate, you know? Well,

Speaker 2:          01:57:27       what's interesting to me is that as this evidence piles up and it seems to be continuing to pile up as more like the, the impact sites and more of this ancient civilization material gets unearthed, it's almost insurmountable.

Speaker 3:          01:57:44       Yeah. It's almost, and this is how this is how paradigm shift, I mean everybody is familiar with the concept of a paradigm shift and there's a book called the structure of scientific revolutions by Thomas Kuhn, which outlines what a paradigm shift is, where an established model in some discipline of science that has been in control of people's thinking for a very long time suddenly falls apart and it doesn't fall apart. Suddenly what happens is that there's an accumulation of evidence which that model cannot explain. That paradigm cannot explain it. It seemed like a great paradigm at one point, but then it doesn't explain this and then it doesn't explain like, like the paradigm that says that Megalithic architecture is only 6,000 years old and that the first megalithic architecture was in Multa that can't explain the massive Megalithic site of Quebec, Lee Tempe and Turkey 5,500 years before that.

Speaker 3:          01:58:34       It's evidence like that the slow accumulation of evidence that the existing system cannot explain that at eventual point, no matter how strongly the advocates of the existing system hold on to it, no matter how determined they are in their defense, no matter what dirty tricks they may choose to deploy to undermine their opponents, sooner or later, the evidence overwhelms them and the paradigm goes down and you have a new way of thinking and that that is the story of, of science. And it is a story that I think, I think we're at a tipping point in our understanding of the past of the human species. I am not saying that I am 100% right. I believe that what I'm doing that's worthwhile is I'm asking questions about the past that haven't been asked enough. I'm putting archeologist on the spot and, and demanding that they explain themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:59:22       I don't, I don't claim that I'm right. I'm offering an alternative theory. And my objective is to get people to think for themselves, to think about this stuff and not to accept, uh, the voice of authority as the, as the sole, uh, medium of truth. That's, that's what I've tried to do. Have you had any, uh, archeologist review any of this work and change their opinions? No. No I haven't. But what I, what I have found, uh, and I've, I've found it interestingly during the research trips for America before a, is a younger generation of archeologists who are in the field. Um, and they are quite different from the older generation of archeologists who are running the whole scene 25 years ago or now. We have a very different younger generation and younger generation that has been exposed to open minded thinking, um, that has been exposed to the Internet.

Speaker 3:          02:00:13       That itself as part of the general pattern of the younger generation is suspicious of authority. I'm meeting young archeologist on sites. For example, I met a couple of really amazing young minds, uh, on a site called Blackwater draw, uh, in, um, uh, Arizona and New Mexico where, where the one of the first Clovis sites, the young archeologist I met there were incredibly open minded and, and really willing to consider extraordinary possibilities about the past and privately admitted to me that they'd read my books. Well, that's where I get the hope. I get the hope in this young generation that is growing up with the Internet that does understand that there's a lot more out there than just what they're being taught in schools. Yes. Yeah. Isn't this, is this, this is where the, where the hope lies and it lies in, in every area. And it's why one of the, one of the intriguing things that has happened with me and your show is an important part of this is that when I go around giving public events, doing a public presentation of my work, the demography of the audiences is extremely interesting.

Speaker 3:          02:01:18       And this is true whether I'm giving the talk in Britain, whether I'm giving it in Canada, whether I'm giving it in America. Part of the audience are older people who read me in the 1990s who got onto my work with fingerprints of the Gods in 1995 and they've stuck with me and they've carried on reading my work. But another part of the audience, and a very big part of the audience consists to a large extent of young people, most of whom are men, but there are women amongst them as well. And what those mainly young men come up to me and say at the end of the event is we first encountered your work on Joe Rogan's show and it completely opened our minds. It changed it. I've had so many young men say, this has changed my life. And then I asked myself, well, why should a different take on the past change people's lives?

Speaker 3:          02:02:07       Why should people feel that their lives have been changed by a different take on the past, which I add they would not know about unless you had the good grace to, to bring me on the, on, on your show. This, these ideas would not be known, but they are known because of the amazing outreach of your show. And the answer to that question, why does it, why does it change a person's life is that once we realize that we have been misinformed about our past, that everything that we've built, our idea of who we are upon and of where we're going as a culture may be founded on false hoods and perhaps even deliberate lies. Once that is realized, then all the questions about the nature of the society we live in become open. Uh, and, and people, young people are feeling the need to take an independent path, not to, not to follow the path that has been set down for them, uh, by, by previous generations.

Speaker 3:          02:03:02       And in some way, and I'm very gratified to hear this, the fact that I am an elder now, I'm 69 next, next birthday. The fact that I look great. Thank you. The fact that I as an elder, um, have consistently pursued an independent past part, have been willing to put up with the shit that's been thrown at me over the years, but have stuck to my guns and have continued to add new information to the dossier of information that I put forward. That is, and I'm encouraged to see this, that's founders inspiring by younger people. And what, what better gift could an old guy hope to leave to the world than a younger generation who feel inspired by that person's work to change the world? Well, I'm very, very thankful that I could introduce people to you because your first book that I read of you, fingerprints of the Gods changed my view of the world.

Speaker 3:          02:03:52       I mean, I remember putting that book down after I was finished and going, wow, if he's right and like this whole thing is a mess. Yeah. A complete mess. Big because our idea of who we are is very much founded in our idea of who we were. And, and one of the, I think one of the mistakes that's made in our civilization is that, uh, we are very conceited with very big headed and we tend to review the v view, the whole story of history as though it's a project that leads to us that we're what it's all about. And I think what is, um, what is, uh, how can I put it undermining of the existing system, about a new take on the past is the, is is the notion we're not what it's all about at all. Uh, that there may have been an earlier civilization that reached a high level of advancement, perhaps different from ours, but nevertheless, an advanced civilization, which was just taken out of the story completely by a global cataclysm. Uh, then we suddenly, we suddenly realized that in a way we're here accidentally, that it's not been a process that's been all about us. Uh, and that if we'd been misinformed about how we got here, then we need to get the true information about, about what's going on. So, so these are, um, in a way, profoundly revolutionary ideas. They do, they do lead people on a path of inquiry that leads to questioning of everything

Speaker 2:          02:05:17       and our fears that you were just discussing earlier about how soft we are in comparison to past civilizations in terms of our ability to live off the land. That's one aspect that bothers me. But one of the big ones that bothers me is the fact that everything is digital. All of our information is stored on hard drives. You Bet. And if that goes down, there's not much left. You have paper books and, and you know, a few thousands of years, imagine what will be left. Yeah, we would lose all of our advancement.

Speaker 3:          02:05:50       Well, I can, I can speak to this at a, at a, at a personal level. There was a time when I was an excellent map reader. I could navigate anywhere with, with maps, you know, my wife Santha and I did huge journeys in Mexico back in the early 1990s in really cheap hire cars with maps. And we found our way everywhere without any problem today I can hardly use a map. The skill of using a map has lapsed within me. Why? Because of GPS, GPS technology has come along and it's, and it, it always tells me where I am and being a bit lazy, uh, I just accept that, that technology, but then I had caused to us myself this just the other day. Supposing gps, supposing all the satellites go down and there's no gps is the whole, the whole industrialized human race is going to suddenly be lost. Uh, all those Uber drivers who don't know their way from a to B and who rely entirely on their gps is they weren't, no, they won't know where they're going. And it's, and it's true with digital data. The digital digital data, unlike unlike print data is I'm very fragile, uh, and requires programs in order to access and interpret it that a much more complicated than simply cracking the code of a, a lost language

Speaker 2:          02:07:04       mean the programs vary between different phone platform. Exactly. They very computer platforms. It's just, it's so fragile and it's so, I mean, I don't know if there's any precautions that have been taking place to preserve this information in case of like what Robert Schoch described coronal mass ejection or something,

Speaker 3:          02:07:21       then click down all the satellites. Yeah. No, I don't think, I don't think preparation has been made and I don't, and I don't. And it's very clear that that preparation is not being made for the risk of another cosmic impact. Uh, and again, a point that I'd like to make about this is that we are at, we are in a sense in a place where history can repeat itself, uh, that there are certain cycles at work. Uh, the work on the comet impact 12,000, 800 years ago. How has very clearly and specifically identified the Deborah trail of that comment. And that Deborah trail is the Taurid meteor stream and it's called the Taurid meteor stream because it appears to emanate from the region of the sky in which the constellation of tourists sets. It doesn't, it's within our solar system. It's an optical illusion. The Taurid meteor stream is a giant complex of debris.

Speaker 3:          02:08:17       Uh, it is 30 million kilometers wide. What you had was an original comment that might've been a hundred to 200 kilometers in diameter, a small moon, which fragmented and broken up into multiple, multiple parts. And those parts began to spread out along the whole orbit of the Taurid meteor stream and to widen the whole thing widened. So it's like a giant tube of debris and the evidence and the argument is that 12,000, 800 years ago, several large bits of that debris fell out of the Taurid meteor stream and impacted with the earth. The problem is that the Taurid meteor stream still exists and our planets still passes through it twice a year. Uh, and those passages take place in June and in November. And each passage takes 12 and a half days and the same group of scientists who are, who are looking at the evidence for the impacts 12,800 years ago are deeply concerned that we may face future impacts from the tour with meteor stream.

Speaker 3:          02:09:17       That there are still large objects up there. This is not theory, this is a fact. There's a comment up there, uh, called [inaudible], which is part of the Taurid meteor stream. It's a large fragment of the original giant comic comic Danky has a diameter of, I don't know, five or five or six kilometers. There's, there's 19 recognized huge objects within the Taurid meteor stream calculations indicate that there may be as much as 200 asteroids within the Taurid meteor stream of a diameter of a kilometer or more, which would have catastrophic effect if they, if they hit the earth and responsible astronomers regard the Taurid meteor stream as the greatest collision hazard facing mankind at the present time. And it's not something that we need to fall into despair about because it's perfectly within the level of our technology to do something about it. What could they do? Well, to give you an example, a commercial interests are looking right now and the technology is there to mine asteroids.

Speaker 3:          02:10:11       We can go to asteroids if the, if the commercial interest is high enough, we can go to them, we can mine them, we can extract minerals, we can bring them back to the earth. The same technology would allow you to move asteroids or comet fragments. You don't want to blow them up with a nuke. That would be a really bad idea that would, that would, uh, turn the one large object into multiple smaller objects, which could cause equally massive devastation and, and would be very difficult to predict where that devastation was going to fall. What you want to do is to nudge them and move them out of the dangerous orbit into, into a less dangerous Orbitz. And, and, and the evidence is in the next 30 years, we are going to be passing through dangerous filaments of the toward meteor stream. And if we were smart, we would be devoting some resources to protecting our cosmic environment.

Speaker 3:          02:10:58       Just as we, there are many issues that we need to devote resources to. Unfortunately, the one that's most attractive to our politicians at the moment is warfare. Uh, we devote limitless resources to technologies of mass destruction. There. There really is no end to the amount that we are prepared to spend on that in terms of our so called security. We feel somehow we're making ourselves more secure by having these incredible weapons and spending trillions of dollars on them. But the cosmos doesn't give a fuck about any of that. The Cosmos is out there with these, with these giant, giant objects, uh, which have a far greater explosive power than all the nuclear weapons are stored on earth at the, at the present time, the comet shoemaker, Levy nine, which hit Jupiter in 1994 had a total calculated explosive power of 300 gigatons. If you took the entire nuclear arsenal of the world today and blew it all up at once, it would yield 6.4 gigatons.

Speaker 3:          02:11:58       So these objects are producing catastrophic results on a scale that far, far beyond anything that we ourselves could do with nuclear weapons. It's time. We spent a bit less time and money on weapons of mass destruction and a bit more on looking after this beautiful garden that we call the earth. And that is our home and it will be the home of our children and our children's children. I'm a grandfather now. I feel passionately about this. We need to look after this planet. It's our responsibility as a human species to do so. And one of the challenges, it's not the only challenge. There are many, many other challenges. One of the challenges is to pay attention to our cosmic environment and to realize that the cosmos can intervene cataclysmically in the human story. And that the Taurid meteor stream in particular may have been a hidden hand in human history that there may have been other impacts in the last 13,000 years that affect have affected and changed the course of humanity on this earth.

Speaker 3:          02:12:52       And the ancients were very good at paying attention to the sky. Uh, we ourselves have amazing tech to study the sky, but for some reason we're ignoring this problem of cosmic impacts. And that's incredibly irresponsible because as I said a moment ago, it is a solvable problem. It is within the limits of our technology. It would require a global cooperative effort to sweep our cosmic environment clean, but it could be done and a side product of that global corporation might be a friendlier, more nurturing, more loving, more positive human community. It is very odd that we have this infant towel nature, even as grown adults and world leaders that we don't, we do like to nor eminent danger. As long as it hasn't affected us in the past, there's, there's no real moment we can point to other than tongue goose Gha in, you know, photographic history, modern history where you could take pictures of things.

Speaker 3:          02:13:48       When we had a gentleman, if I can, if I can pull up on that very point that the evidence is compelling that the Tunguska event was an object then fell out of the Taurid meteor stream that happened at the peak of the beat of tourists in June, 1900 and eight that it is extremely likely that that Tunguska object came from the Taurid meteor stream because we were passing through the Taurid meteor stream at exactly that time and what the tango Ska object is estimated to be between 60 and 190 meters in diameter. So it's not a very big object. It's not a kilometer scale object. It's a, it's, it's, it's big, but it's not that big. It doesn't even hit the earth. It's an Airburst. It explodes in the sky above fortunately and uninhabited area of Siberia. But the devastation is huge. It wasn't even noticed for some years afterwards until scientific teams went in and studied the area and discovered that 80 million trees across 2000 square kilometers had been completely flattened by that airburst.

Speaker 3:          02:14:47       Uh, and to put that in context, 2000 square kilometers is the size of London. So anybody who knows London is aware that there's a ring road around London called the m 25 if that air best had taken place over central London, everything of London out as far as the m 25 would have been gone completely. Is that what it looks like today? Great. Pretty close to, there's like a hundred years later, there's no trees and if you've got, you're looking at above there, you're looking at the black and whites that were taken in the early 19 hundreds. God, yeah. Which, which revealed the extent of this, uh, of this damage. So it's just stupid of us not to pay a bit more attention to this, especially when we have the tech to actually do something about it. We have that, that nature though, when it comes to climate designee, a curious denial, there's a denial of the role of cataclysms in the human story.

Speaker 3:          02:15:37       And there, there is even a word for that in, in science and it's called uniformitarianism. And, and this is a particular philosophy of science where the view is that everything is, we see it in the world today is how things have always been. So if we don't see cataclysms today and they're not playing a major part in our story today, then there weren't cataclysms and they didn't play a major part in our story in the past. That's why, although it's before the time of human beings, when the evidence that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a comet or an asteroid, a first came out, um, Lewis and Walter Alvarez, the father, son team who were behind that science were ridiculed by their colleagues and they were telling us absolutely absurd. Of course, no cosmic event could have made the dinosaurs extinct. They spent 10 years taking that ridicule until they found the crater in the Gulf of Mexico.

Speaker 3:          02:16:28       Since then, the whole scientific community has accepted that the course of life on this planet was radically changed by a cosmic impact. And you know, I like to joke about it, but it was a cosmic impact that was big enough literally to turn dinosaurs into chickens because that's what's left of the time. So align is, you know, the birds. And at the same time, skulking in those prime evil forests is this little mammal and it looks a bit like a shrew, a 65 million years ago going nowhere. The dinosaurs ruled the earth, then the cosmos intervenes. The dinosaurs are swept out of the way. And what happens, the mammals start to evolve very rapidly and they start to occupy niches that were previously closed to them. And the bottom line is we would not be here. The human species would not be here. We would not be having this conversation if the dinosaurs had not been made extinct 65 million years ago. Uh, so these are world changing events. And my argument is that such a world changing event occurred between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, and it's high time. We paid more attention to it.

Speaker 2:          02:17:35       Is there any evidence that there was other species of human beings that existed in the Americas, like we're finding in Russia and there's many of them that are being discovered all over the world now, these subspecies of human beings.

Speaker 3:          02:17:52       Yeah. Um, this is, uh, an issue that I go into in, in America before. And what first drew me into it was Dennis over K in Siberia. I think everybody's head of the neanderthals and these days, I think everybody's head of the Denisovans as well. A lot of people have a lot of, well, I guess a lot of people haven't, but, but first of all, let's take the neanderthals. For a long time it was held that the neanderthals were stupid, primitive subhumans shambling lacking symbolism. Turns out that that's not true at all. The latest scientific evidence on the neanderthals is that they were symbolic creatures. That they did do art, that they were in every sense human, and they were in every sense human because anatomically modern humans interbred with neanderthals, you can't interbreed with another species. They clearly were a human human beings, but they looked rather different from us.

Speaker 3:          02:18:42       And that's why certain populations in the world today still have three to 5% of Neanderthal DNA. Then in Russia, in Dennis serve a cave, they find a single pinky bone from a little finger. And, uh, they do the DNA testing on it. They're able to get a complete a genome from it. And what they discover is this isn't in the, and Athol, this isn't an anatomically modern human being. This is another human species, uh, who they named the Denisovans. They think they're more closely related to neanderthals than they are to anatomically modern humans, but they're clearly and other human species. And they also interbred with anatomically modern humans and Denisovan DNA survives, interestingly enough, it's a predominantly in Australasia, uh, in Papua New Guinea and amongst Australian aborigines. So as part of the research for this book, I went to Dennis have a cave. I had an amazing, actually just incredible trip to Russia.

Speaker 3:          02:19:43       I hadn't, I hadn't expected it to be like that at all. Siberia. I mean, America is vast, but my God, crossing Siberia, this endless rolling plains, you know, this just vast area. How did you cross it? We took a car, a w well, you can't travel independently in Russia. It's very difficult. You have to get, you have to get permission and you have to state in advance where you're going to be stopping off that. So what I found, and I just did, so through the Internet was a, was a local guy called Sergey Corgan, um, who had a little tour business, um, in, in, in, in Siberia, in the city of novel Sybil risk. I got in touch with him. He found a translator who would translate my emails and I said, we want to make this journey to Dennis over cave and can you set this up for us and get all the permissions.

Speaker 3:          02:20:32       And, and he did. And so we flew into novice, a bisque Sergei and his translator who turned out to be a, a Russian student who spoke good English, joined us. And we did this immense journey across Siberia. Oh, it took us three days to get to, to get to Dennis over cave, three days, three days of driving every day. Some stopping off along the way. Incredible hospitality of the, of, of the Russians that we were, we're amongst very independent people, people who are living out there in the wilderness and who actually do, do know how to survive. As the first time I've ever drank milk fresh from the cow, literally milked right out of the cow and poured down my throat. I was, it was delicious. And the cream, I mean thick, thick cream. So it was a lot of things about Russia that surprised me.

Speaker 3:          02:21:15       Dennis over caves. A fascinating, beautiful place to visit. It's another, it's another example of a missing chapter in the human story that is beginning to be pieced together. It's obvious now that we were not alone, that there were multiple other human species who were human enough to interbreed with us and leave leave DNA. And there's Dennis [inaudible] species was only discovered in like, was it 2000? So I'm very recently the 2007. It's a very, it's a very recent discovery and, and it's a little behind art. Hmm. Did they leave behind art better than that? They left behind, um, certain physical objects, which are extremely hard to explain. One of them is a green stone bracelet. Uh, and that bracelet is in the form of a talk, which was therefore slipped on sideways onto the hand. It's not a full ring. Um, and a hole has been drilled through the bracelet and from that whole it's been possible to reconstruct that a pendant was hung then the archeologists, there it is.

Speaker 3:          02:22:15       Then the archaeologists started to take a look in detail at the drill marks on that hole. And what they discovered was a huge anomaly that that was drilled with a stable fixed drill and it was drilled at extremely high speed. It's a, this is thought to be 40 or 50,000 years old. There is not supposed to have been any such technology in that period that was capable of drilling with a stable fixed to drill. And yet there it is there it appears. So there, there are also incredible, very fine needles, bone needles that the Denisovans made very long ones, which suggests that they were stitching very heavy stuff together. And the suggestion has been were they making skin boats, for example, to to use to navigate that would explain how they managed to get themselves to Australia, which is where the largest amount of Denisovan DNA survives today.

Speaker 3:          02:23:06       There's one of those, there's one of those needles so that there are indications of strangely out of place technology amongst the dentist servants, which is 20 30,000 years earlier in the human story. Then it then it should be those kinds of needles, that kind of bracelet. You could expect to find them in what archeologists call the Neolithic, but to find it in the Paleolithic is very puzzling and very odd and it suggests that the Denisovans were certainly not a sat shambling sub subhumans that they, they were refined creatures. Can you find out what year the discover the Denisovans? Jamie, can you Google that real quick? I want to say it's in the two thousands but I mean a ma, imagine that human beings have been around for this long. Here we are in 2019 and within the last decade or so, they figured this out. Yeah. We're discovering new stuff about ourselves.

Speaker 3:          02:23:53       We're discovering that our story is much richer, much more textured, much more lead than we thought it was. It's not a simple story. It's a very complicated story. And we ourselves are a hybrid species. We are, we are the result of interactions with all kinds of different looking human beings. And the end, the end result is ourselves. So it's not just that we carry neanderthal or Denisovan DNA in a sense. We are neanderthals and Denisovans, uh, you know, and have their, they are part of the anatomically modern human human heritage. So you make a good point. The fact that this is only being discovered now and that it's an incredibly important, I mean, it, it completely rewrite the story of our ancestry. The notion, the notion of 19 seven 1970s Oh, the real work that's been done in Dennis Server cave has been done in the two thousands from, from 2006, 2007 that's when the major papers have been 2008 there had been published, which have, which have revealed the genome of the dentist's servants and revealed the dentist's over and connection to two anatomically modern humans.

Speaker 3:          02:25:01       The fact that we're only finding this out now that we, that we told the story of our past and weren't aware of this raises the question, how much else in the story of our past is there that we're not aware of? Let's stop being so arrogant, so sure of ourselves. So confident in our findings that's be more tentative. Let's keep an open mind and see and see where it takes us. That's the main message that I have from, from all of this. And I think, um, and I hope that this will be an effect of this book. I'm not, I'm not kidding myself that the archeologists are going to jump on board, uh, overnight particularly. So since I'm very critical of American archeology in this book and I'm critical of it specifically and explicitly because of the dominance of the Clovis first model for so long, which prevented the research taking place.

Speaker 3:          02:25:51       And I have to say archaeologists like to insult me by calling me a pseudo scientist. I can't think of anything more pseudoscientific than the Clovis first doctrine, which locked American archeology for 50 years in a particular framework, which we now know was totally wrong. Nothing good about it at all. Uh, a complete mistake. What I'm hoping the book will do a in the long run is that it will lead to more attention being focused on the Americas. This is a very neglected area of the world. Uh, as far as deep and ancient archeology goes. Um, it's, the recent history of the Americas has been relatively well studied, but the deep and ancient history has not been, has not been well studied. And I think America is going to contain revelations for us about our story and about our past. And I'm serious when I, when I suggest that America is the most plausible and the most likely home base for a lost civilization.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       If you're going to propose a lost civilization, you need, there are certain preconditions. You need a, you can't have it on a small island. There's got to be a large land mass with enormous resources and the ability for population to grow and for those resources to be, to be mobilized. And what I suddenly realized, you asked earlier why I, why I started to write this book at all is what the new evidence is pointing to is that the Americans have been wrongly neglected. That here we have a giant continental land mass with extraordinary resources that has just been ruled out of the story of human civilization. But once we take account of the fact that there was a giant cataclysm over North America 12,000, 800 years ago, and once we start looking as I do in America before, at the incredible deep indepth similarities between, for example, the religious system of ancient Egypt and the religious system of the Mississippi Valley, then you realize that you're into, uh, into a global mystery here.

Speaker 3:          02:27:52       And that the answer to that mystery may not at all be in the old world and may very much be, uh, in the, in the Americas. See, it's odd. I mentioned Manville earlier on. It's kind of odd that we should find a, what is essentially the ancient Egyptian religion, uh, manifesting in the symbolism of Mountville, the ascent to Orion that transit to the Milky Way, the journey along the Milky Way. Very, these are very specific and idiosyncratic ideas. And what makes it doubly od is Manville, isn't that old Manville as a site is about a thousand years old. Ancient Egypt had already been gone completely from the world for at least 600 years before Manville was created. The end of ancient Egypt. There's, there's Mountville and uh, w w what we're looking at in the foreground is mount B and we're looking at Monday and the in the, in the distance, um, and, and a complete circle of mountains.

Speaker 3:          02:28:49       What w what is odd about it is we find the system of ancient Egyptian ideas in Moundsville 500 years after ancient Egypt has gone from the world. The Romans, the Romans were the end of ancient Egypt by 400 Aad, ancient Egypt has gone. Manville doesn't even exist then, but 600 years later it is created and it manifests the entire set of ancient Egyptian ideas. Clearly it did not get that as a result of direct transmission from ancient Egypt unless they were time travelers. The only way I think it could have got it is as a result of a legacy passed down from a much earlier civilization that has influenced and affected many different parts of the world and the characteristics of that civilization, the shamanistic heart of it, the use of altered states of consciousness. The focus on those are amongst the reasons that I would suggest that America is the place that we should be looking and the big mysteries are in the areas that were so devastated at the end of the last ice age up in the north of North America, the channel scab lands in particular, and then the Mississippi Valley, the whole story of the Mississippi Valley.

Speaker 3:          02:29:53       Yes, Manville is a thousand years old, but then you can go back to poverty point in Louisiana, which is 2,700 years old. You can go to Watson break in Louisiana, which is 5,500 years old. You can go to sites like Conley, which are 8,000 years old. The system keeps on going back and disappearing back into time. And I think the most fruitful new work on exploring the origins of civilization is going to occur counter intuitively in the Americas. The very last place on earth that archeologists have ever thought to look where to what to mainstream, uh, archeologists, what do they think caused those drill marks? And then Dennis over and bracelets, if not really explained it. Um, the, the Russian, the Russian archeologist who published the report on that, uh, are them, are themselves mystified by it and they realize that it's dynamite. It's an, it's an explosive discovery.

Speaker 3:          02:30:47       Uh, it's a, it's an out of place technology. And so they're trying to explain how come fixed stable drilling, which we thought was introduced first in the, in the Neolithic maybe seven, 8,000 years ago. How come that is now found in a site that's 40 or 50,000 years old? And so all those bracelets, oh yeah, absolutely. Those bracelets or 40,000 at the May, they may have been older. There's, there's, there's recent research suggests suggesting that they may go back 65 to 70,000 years, the extremely ancient and therefore, and therefore they're an out-of-place technology which doesn't fit with the timeline of history that we've been out of place. It was very, very out of place. Very, very, very odd feature that we have here. So what this says to me is that we as a species, and I've this, I guess this is kind of my pet phrase, we are a species with Amnesia is my favorite phrase of we have forgotten so much more about ourselves than we remember.

Speaker 3:          02:31:44       And what the process of history and archeology should really be about is a process of remembering. We shouldn't be imposing our ideas of what we should have been on the past. We should allow the past to speak for itself when it does. So it speaks eloquently. Um, one of the sites that we visited and explored for America before was sip ant mound in Ohio. I don't know if you've ever been there. You know, I've heard of it though. It is an amazing, Jamie is from Ohio. Your Beta. Yeah. Jamie and I were talking about it earlier. There's seven man, there's a, there's an aerial view of that is Correy. Here's the thing. You see that beautiful. You see the head end of separate man. They're so Santa and I went there at the summer solstice in uh, 2017. We were there on June 21st, 2017 and my wife Santha is a photographer and we acquired a drone for this specific purpose and she flew the drone up 400 feet above separate mount and we sat it up there watching the sunset.

Speaker 3:          02:32:51       And what happens on the summer solstice, and you can only see it perfectly with adrenaline there. There's pictures of it in the, in the book here. Uh, what happens on the summer solstice, you can see it from ground level, but you get up 400 feet, you really get it. The head of that serpent is pointing directly at a niche in the distant hills through which the sun sets on the summer solstice on the longest day of the year. So it's a, it's a sky ground alignment perfection that is, that is taking place there. It's a beautiful, it's a beautiful thing to see, to watch that sun majestically sinking down into the horizon and see this awesome figure of the serpent gazing directly. I've attic with its jaws open almost as though it's about to, about to swallow the sun. And then we remember that there are other sites around the world which are also aligned to key moments of the, of the solar year aligned to the winter solstice.

Speaker 3:          02:33:45       For example, the Temple of Karnak in Upper Egypt. That kilometer long access targets exactly the rising point of the sun on the winter solstice. One of the interesting things about serpent mound, and I urge anybody listening to this go visit serpent mound and especially go there on the summer solstice cause that's the moment. That's the marriage of heaven and earth. That's when Skyann ground unite in, in Majesty at, uh, at, at, at that place. Um, but one of the mysteries of serpent mound concerns, how old is this mound? Really? How, how, how far back does it go? And there have been arguments that uh, that there's a group of archeologists who would like it to be just a thousand years old and they attributed it to a culture of called the fort ancient culture. There's another group of archeologists in my view who have done much more thorough, thorough work who attributed to the Edina culture.

Speaker 3:          02:34:40       The thing about which goes back to 2,300 years ago or so, there's evidence for an earlier construction enterprise. It looks like the site has been continuously reconstructed and remodeled as we would do with any sacred site. If it begins to wear down, you remodel it and then you get later organic material being introduced to the site. That may give you the impression that the site is only that old. What's intriguing about serpent mound is it stands on a natural ridge and that natural ridge, and this is entirely an accident of heaven and earth, that Natural Ridge, the head end of it, if you like, is naturally oriented to the summer solstice sunset. Somebody a long time ago noticed that natural orientation and they decided to monumentalize it. Here was a place where earth whispered to sky the earth in her own nature, looked directly at the place on the horizon where the sun was setting.

Speaker 3:          02:35:37       This was a highly significant place. This place mattered. So they then created serpent mound on top of it. They memorialized it. They turned it into a, into a special special place that human beings had had a hand in making to honor the marriage of heaven and earth. And what I found researching this book is that serpent mound is not alone in that respect. A lot of people are puzzled by Stonehenge in England. A stone Henge is built on Salisbury plain and there are two kinds of big megaliths that Stonehenge, one of them are called sostenes and the other called the bluestones. The blue stones, we know for sure were brought along way. They were brought from Wales to Stonehenge, a distance of about 150 miles. The sarsens are found in abundance on a place called the mob downs, which is about 20 miles from Stonehenge.

Speaker 3:          02:36:30       But until very recently it was thought there were no sauces on Salisbury plain at all. An archeologist couldn't understand why Stonehenge wasn't built on the Marlboro downs weather, whether it's big Saas and stones, the 20 to 30 10 megaliths where available locally and didn't have to be brought there. Very recent research, 2018 research has provided the answer that two of those sauces were naturally in position all the time at at Stonehenge. And they are sauce and stone 16 and the heel stone. And if you stand behind and stone 16 and look at the Hillstone at dawn on the summer solstice you see the sun rising in direct alignment with the view and the heel stone is like the site on the barrel of a rifle targeting the sun. And that was there naturally it was speaking to sky. The ancient saw that they decided this was sacred.

Speaker 3:          02:37:20       They went to huge lengths to bring the sauces, the rest of the Sarsens from the mob redounds to create the big stone circle at Stonehenge and meant to put the blue stones inside it. But initially what they were celebrating was a natural union of Heaven and earth. And that brings us to the notion of as above. So below that we are connected to the cosmos. That it is, that it is part of our heritage. We in modern cities, forget the cosmos exists. We have all kinds of tech that can look at astronomy, astronomy programs, we can, we'd all do that. But actually looking at the stars is something that's very difficult for people who live in cities to do where we're cut off from the cosmos, we're cut off from the notion that it is sacred, that it matters to the human creature. And what, what the ancient seem to have had done is to realize how vital that connection is and to memorialize it and to celebrate it and to draw our attention to the intimate connection between ground Scott.

Speaker 3:          02:38:16       Yeah. Light pollution sort of fuels our infant tile existence and a lot of ways, right? Because it doesn't constantly remind us that we're a part of this great thing. Yeah. Light, light, light, light pollution is, uh, is, is, is a huge factor. It's very easy to forget that we live in a universe. Very easy to forget that. Very easy to, to believe that it's just about these cities that we live in and the, and the intimate concerns of our, of our daily lives. But when in fact we're part of something much, much bigger. And my God, I mean, it's, it's a mystery enough to be born a human being at all. Yes. You know, just to be alive is a, is, is, is, is an extraordinary mystery. Yes. To have the ability to love, uh, to, to, to feel emotions, um, to understand beauty, to be moved by, by, by a symphony.

Speaker 3:          02:39:07       All of all of these things we take for granted, but actually they're deeply mysterious. We don't really know what we are or who we are and which is one of the reasons I'm so fascinated by, uh, Rick Strassman's work. You, you presented his film, Dmt, the spirit molecule, and on my upcoming speaking to her, I'm going to be doing an event with Rick, uh, on the 14th or 15th of May in Sedona. I think it will be the first time that Rick has spoken publicly for quite a while. Rick has a colleague called Andrew Gallimore, uh, who teaches at the University of La Kinawa, uh, in Japan and Rick and Andrew have together developed a technology, uh, for releasing DMT into human volunteers in a very slow drip that will keep them in the DMT state if they wish for hours on end. And the intention, the intention is to use this technology to explore and map the DMT realm.

Speaker 3:          02:40:09       When do I sign up? Soon as possible. Where do I, it's it's very close. Imperial College. It looks like Imperial College London is going to deploy this technology in further research into DMT and that that research is not going to be purely and simply into the therapeutic potential of a psychedelic, which is very important research to do. It's going to be an investigation into the nature of reality using a psychedelic, the mysterious nature of reality. And it is art. And you know this from personal experience that when you get plunged into that DMT realm, it is so different from the realm of our daily daily world filled, filled with geometry, filled with these sprightly intelligences completely internally coherent. How can that be generated by the brain or are are we dealing with some other level of reality that we haven't encountered yet? I think that ancient cultures and in particular my lost civilization were deeply involved in exploring the mysterious nature of reality, um, and used the plant medicines as part of that process.

Speaker 3:          02:41:12       When it comes to the serpent mound where the head points in the summer solstice is that take into account the procession of the equinoxes in terms of the position of the summer solstice sun on the horizon is not effected by the procession, however it is affected by another, another factor which is a slight nod on the axis of the earth, a nod but not a wobble, not a wobble and a nod and, and a, it's called a mutation and the, the access of the earth nods back and forward over a cycle of about 41,000 years. And that can, that does adjust the position of sunrise on the horizon over a very long period of time. And it would, in theory, if this idea can be taken seriously enough, it would in theory be possible to use very precise observations using the latest modern tech, not simply being up there in a drone and seeing the general connection between the position of the sun on the horizon and the head of serpent.

Speaker 3:          02:42:07       Marty would be possible to refine that and actually say astronomically the precise date on which serpent mound must have been first created to precisely target the rising sun on the equinox. Wow. On that note, which did three hours did we buy? I would, I would ask your listeners and viewers while we're talking about Ohio, don't forget about Newark and high bank. These are two incredible, amazing, absolutely stunning, gorgeous geometrical sites. It's sad, but one of them is preserved within a private golf course. Oh, no. However, it's not so sad because if it hadn't been preserved within a private golf course, it would be gone completely. More than 90% of the native American earthworks that were documented in the 19th century are gone now. They'd been plowed under for agriculture. That's another part of our missing story there. We're looking at Newark, see that octagon and circle combination that's repeated at another site called high bank, which is 60 miles away.

Speaker 3:          02:43:07       And the octagon circling gimme a gimme a large image that, so an overlay or is that what it actually looks for? It actually looks like that's, I mean that's, that's, that's a graphic based on it. Well the octagon circle combination in the top left of the image are best preserved. The other bits are not so well preserved. And the reason the octagon circle our best preserved is cause they're in a private golf club where otherwise they would have been plowed under. The interesting thing is that that octagon circle combination is 60 miles from high bank, but there's another octagon circle combination there and it is oriented that precisely 90 degrees to that one. That speaks of high science in the Mississippi Valley are very, very, very long time ago. There's so much to explore and so much to investigate and so much to inquire into an America.

Speaker 3:          02:43:52       Uh, it's just an incredible land and its mysteries have been hidden from us. And I'm hoping with this book that I have managed to pull the veil back a little bit on those mysteries, and if we really coming to the end of earth, he said, really three hours. Oh my God. If we, if we're really coming to the end of our three hours, can I repeat? I would love to see readers of my books at my events. I'm doing three events in Canada, Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto, and I'm doing something like 17 or 18 events in the United States. I'm just speaking continuously, uh, right the way across the u s I wish I could visit every state in the u s but my goodness, this is an enormous country. Every state in the U s is as big as the entire British isles, you know? Uh, but I'm in visiting as many as I am.

Speaker 3:          02:44:38       I'm going to be giving illustrated presentations. I'll be signing books afterwards. I'll be taking pictures. I would like to meet my readers and please check out my website, Graham hancock.com look at the talks and events page, and you'll see where all these events are occurring over the next seven weeks. We're on the 22nd of April today. I will not leave North American until the 5th of June. Oh, wow. I hope I see you again then in, listen, thank you so much. You're a treasure and this book is, I can't wait to get into it America before and the audio book is available now as well. Yeah, the audio books available. I read it. Thank you so much, Graham. It's always a pleasure having you here. I'm really, really appreciate you. Thanks for having me back on, Joe Graham Hancock, ladies and gentlemen. Bye.

Speaker 4:          02:45:24       Okay.
