Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Gentle man, what's up? You dirty bitches were live. Refresh your browser saying you could see us in the youth stream like we are seeing ourselves. I muted it. You Fuck, you can't get me. Good job. Yeah. So. Hi everybody. It's a week like 20 or some shit. This is insane dude. With this is we're all the way into may almost. This is April 27th. Is that what it is? Yeah, we started the late December. Yeah, we started at the beginning of the Christmas. Yeah. We basically started at the beginning of the year and here we are. It was a number three last week on the itunes for podcasts, which is ridiculous because the fucking production value is God damn awful for itunes. I Apologize Ladies and gentlemen. It's Kinda, it's Kinda cool to get better. Well it's definitely it's garage, but uh, we got a bunch of new shit coming where right now.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       This is just my, uh, my desk, um, we have cleaned everything out and the couch couches coming in Thursday and the green screen slightly after that we got new, a MP, three audio recorder, some big fucking serious jammies here before the cow, smallest after accounts saying it is okay to use dreams [inaudible] up on me. I've been watching. We just went from zero to 850 viewers within what, two minutes? One minute. And then let's sort of those boring or so this is some new shit. We got to make the sound better for you. I tunes people and thank you very much for putting up with it up to this wall and I appreciate all your suggestions and I know people get harsh with the criticisms, but the bottom line is that's your real opinion and uh, I appreciate it. You know, um, I've got a thick skin.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       I've been in show business for a long time and most people have been saying I suck ever since day one. So you get used to it. But I think all your criticisms are valid. Uh, we're working on the production quality. We have real microphones now of course we have this and then we also have. I'll have to hold onto this for a second. We bought some serious sennheiser microphones just like you would use in a recording studio. So at the end of the day when all is said and done alcohol swabs to clean that shit off and make it all nice. Nice. We don't want to, I guess get nerves, but uh, so we're turning this thing into a real, a production studio. We're going to have cameras on tripods and the whole deal. And I'm stealing a page out of Anthony Kumi. His book, Anthony Kumiai is one of the dudes from opiod, Anthony. Super Cool Guy and he does a bad ass radio show from his house. Um, and uh, he's one of the ones that gave me really the first inspiration to do it because I saw his son up and he set up his fucking bad ass. He hasn't set up basically just like a real radio show, you know, with like real jam and microphones and he has a backdrop and a green screen. So I'm basically stealing anthony's idea

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       with his blessing and with all due credit to Mr Kumi, I should add something to it. They're like a hot tub or something crazy. Anthony is do when you were with us in New York last time,

Speaker 3:          00:03:10       right? You see his gun? Yeah. Carries the gun around a special permit to so you can carry a gun everywhere. It was weird when they brought it up because everyone else in the room was like, oh,

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       they were all like, they're all concerned about him. They're all worried that he's going to go bananas and kill a bunch of people would she may very well.

Speaker 3:          00:03:28       What kinds kind of make that already. If you bring a gun into a room, even if you're comfortable with your gun, you're now like, that guy has a weapon that could kill me.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       Yeah. That is kind of weird, right? That he wants to do that all the time. I have gone to and I appreciate you wanting to shoot them and use them and it's good to have something to protect yourself because there's a lot of crazy flux out there, but carrying one everywhere. It's just a little strange, but I just say what the fuck. It's like better to happen. Yeah. What's that expression? A better than need it and to have it than not needed and have it. Something like that. So like that, you know, better to not have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. That's the expression. But uh, yeah, I mean he's fucking walk around drafts. It's crazy. It's a big ass fucking gun man. He's got a glock on them at all times with talents, black talent, bullets.

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       I have some of those too, but black towns are like, they don't make em anymore, man. They shred you up really black towels. They don't just go through you as it goes to spreads out. So like talents, like treads the inside of your body out? Yeah. From Mexico. Mortar grenade or something like that. Yeah man. That he carries a gun or they just stopped making. Oh, there's still legal if you have them, if you have them, your grandfather and I believe you can't go out and get them in Anthony's while those graphs and he finds out that Oh, these fucks. They're making things illegal. He'll go into the store and buy like fucking, you know, like wheel barrel falls. He's crazy. He's got like a room in his office or his house that used to be a walk in closet. Whereas girl used to keep our shit and now it's an armory.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       It's an armory. His room is all guns and ammunition and rifles and ak 47 [inaudible] and fucking pistols and everything and it's got alarms, like you have to press separate lumps. You get into that room retinal scanning the Goddamn punisher man. Yeah. He's going to fucking room in his house with an alarm. My dedicated to guns. You open a door and so lik, you know, with like cool lighting and shells and the compound to house houses. The compound. He's, he's alone man. But, but being alone makes for fun radio. He's fucking great on the radio. He's hilarious. He's just funny guy. I liked him. He's a yeah, that's one of the coolest radio shows to do. I have been doing them since like 2000. This is fucking great. Show so much fun. It's just the best hand. You know. Jim Norton is the funniest guy on radio for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       That guy's Goddamn Polaris and the way I just mean and nasty and quick like is the shit that he says like anytime there's some new thing in the news, he's always get like a million. Any refund. He's just riff and just talking shit about people. If you haven't listened to them, opie and anthony, every radio show is hit and miss. You know what I mean? You can't even this fucking thing we're doing, obviously it's hit and miss. You can't be awesome all the time because it's just talking. You know? It's like when you talk for hours at a time, they're talking for like four hours at a time. There's going to be times you're doing something sucks. Did you follow the Tito's Shit at all? Should we talk about that?

Speaker 3:          00:06:19       I got to talk about it because I think it's very crazy, especially if you're following it through. If you don't know, and if you don't know, tell us what was supposedly. Tito was just arrested for allegedly beating up Jenna Jamison and, and then he came out and said, I never hit her. She has a big. Oxy was Oxycontin, oxycontin problems, you know, so it's fucked up on drugs and that's it. So what I thought, I thought that was weird. And then I was watching this clip on tmz where it was Jenna saying he did not beat me up. We had a altercation, you know, but he did not beat me up. People are thinking he's a wife beater. Then like a half hour later, an hour later, Tito puts out a press conference saying, Hey, she is fucked up on Oxycontin. And then immediately her story now is wearing an arm brace. He beat me up and threw me in a brace in the. Even in the beginning, but, but saying that he beat me up and threw me in a hot tub and all this,

Speaker 2:          00:07:12       throwing a chicken arts hub. If you're gonna, if you're gonna throw a chicken or something. Well, how to have a good banker.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       Yeah. But she's a porn star, so you should be allowed to throw her in a hot tub that comes along with a dating, a porn star fucker. She retired and ms dot. But uh, um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       so I think she had a, I think she had the uh, the thing on her arm in the beginning did shit. Yeah. But,

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       but it was kind of weird how the story changed. Right? Well, if she does have, I have

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       that problem, that's a terrible problem. And I know a dude who had that problem for a long time and he, uh, he got prescriptions from. He lived in Texas and he moved to La and you got prescriptions from both doctors. You just couldn't help himself. He's very self indulgent and he just got whacked out on that Shit. But apparently it's, it's easy. It's hard to get off and easy to get on. Like you just start popping up, move. We've talked before on this show about a documentary, and we'll just briefly say it, if you haven't seen it, just google the oxycontin express and it's all about how many people are addicted to this stuff in Florida where they're wacky laws. Florida doesn't have a database of doctors, so the way my friend did it, he got a prescription in Texas and he got a prescription here in California and then he started using ballroom at the same time, getting both of them were filled and I've got all fucking loony.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       But in Florida you can go to like 100 doctors. You don't, they don't have a database of doctors. That's crazy. It's scary shit because it's like, for sure it's pharmaceutical companies. They absolutely know what the fuck they're doing with this stuff. They have, they've been accused and convicted or it's been proven rather than they lied about the, uh, the uh, addiction qualities of Oxycontin that they knew and suppressed information. They knew that it was super, super addictive. I mean, it's basically, it's heroin in a form when they call it hillbilly heroin, that's really what it is. Have you ever been to Florida folks you might want to go just to see these things called pain management centers. I mean, you know, people go on vacation to see like the Great Wall of China. You might want to go on vacation to see the pain management centers because it's a fucking trip. Yeah, it's a heroin store.

Speaker 4:          00:09:15       Shit's fucked up. But I mean, do you think, did you see her reaction and the video? Did you see like the light, she kind of looks,

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       here's, here's the problem, here's the problem with both of them, right? Is I liked both of them. Can talk about them. I'd like to know. And, and we, you know, I met Jenna back when she was with her old husband and she's always been there.

Speaker 4:          00:09:33       She's still with him. I heard, I heard that it never got a divorce.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       Well, either way, she's always been nice to me and I can't talk shit about her. But yeah, it's um, it's a whole thing is unfortunate. I'll tell you, I can't talk shit about, about that, that Faggot, that was fucking Larry King's wife. Now he's talking about it left and right, giving up all the Jews like it was bad enough when all these women were coming out about tiger woods and then Jesse James chicks trying to make her money like it's. That's bad enough, but this fucking guy that's been banging Larry King's wife is the biggest bitch out of all of them. This fucking guy. Okay. Was the baseball coach for Larry King's kids. Okay. He starts banging Larry King's wife and he's banging Larry King's wife and Larry King's bed while Larry King show is being filmed because Larry King wants to know where his wife is at all times, so he makes sure watch the show at least according to this guy so he can quiz her like, what did you think about like Joe did?

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       I asked Tom Cruise the right questions and so she has to be ready to answer. So he's banging her and as he's banging, she's like watching the show, making sure she pays attention to what you know. Fucking Paris Hilton necessarily large. This fucking guy gave up everything, man. He's such a fucking snitch bitch. This is a man. Okay. This is an, uh, a wounded female who dated a guy for a long time. He told her he loved her and she thought that she was going to leave him there. You know, that's not what's happening here. This is not a, this is a man, this is a fucking man. A man who knew the deal right from the get go. And apparently she started buying him. Shit. She's, he's a young guy. Okay. And she's hot for Larry King. But this guy was like, I'm in love with you. I want to marry you. This fucking guy was doing to her the same thing, rich women due to older men. The same, same thing

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       that fucking Larry King's wife was doing, a Larry King. She was trying to get paid and he was trying to get paid to and now he's like, just spilling the beans for just all these magazines and he's talking about his acting career and Larry King helped him. So like kind of like Tito's telling the mother of his two children that my wife is a meth meth head, you know, and stuff like that. Now that's kind of like breaking a weird kind of trust like, Hey, the woman that mother your two cheered on, hey, no, she's on

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Meth, met Oxycontin, oxycontin or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       Well, yes, I could see your point, but if you want to help somebody, maybe that would be the thing to do to make it public. If someone's going wacky and accusing you of doing shit that you didn't do, it's telling everybody the whole entire world and trying to ruin that person's telling the whole entire world that you're a wife beater. If that's not true. Yeah, but if you have a drug problem and then you love that person, you know that then. All right, come on. You know, we both know people with drug. I guess we can't really talk about it, but we can't talk about people with drug problems. But isn't it interesting when someone has a drug problem, like how do you. Then the interesting question is, and if you don't know anybody that has a drug problem out there, well how lucky are you?

Speaker 2:          00:12:32       You're so lucky because it's one of the satisfying things when you know someone who's addicted to anything. I've known people that were addicted to gambling, you know, I know a lot of dudes that are addicted to pussy and that's real. You know, there's, there's people that are addicted to things so they're not just trying to get legs, they're Horny, they're just fucking, they're obsessive, you know, and there's, there's drugs that will fucking for sure take over someone's body. And what do you do about it? We've had the problem, we've had problems with friends of ours, you know, like what do you do about it? My friend Johnny, my best friend growing up, my good do that. I used to play pool with and hang out with in New York. He died from drugs. He died. He was 33 years old. You know, it could happen to anybody. Anybody that fucks around with drugs like Oxycontin's heroin and math and stuff like that and coke. You can get caught. And what do you do? What do you do if your friend gets caught? Your rat them out the fuck you do?

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       I don't think writing out, at least not when you're in a situation where you're not only writing out to the whatever authority you're reading them out to every single person in the world and when you're in a field where you are based off of your persona, like you're an extrovert, she makes money if who she is and she's playing a role, you think he fucked up, but it destroyed her, her, you know, tiger woods style with her in front of twitter, in front of everybody, in front of everything. Her career and the mother

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       have children. But if he didn't do that, let's just say, let's just play devil's advocate. If he didn't do that, so let's say that she just got super dramatic and fell down and decided to call the cops. Or maybe he grabbed her when she was doing something wacky and she fell down and hurt herself. Let's just, I don't know if that happened that I'm certainly not defending anybody who would do anything to a woman. You know, for no reason like that. I mean anybody who loses their temper and physically assaulted women. I'm not defending that, but I've been in situations where people have accused me of things that I haven't done and I know people that have been accused of rape and I know you want to tell yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       Yeah, let's us to luke. Brian has a great store. I mean, I'm kind of in the same situation. Back in the day I, I dated a girl that was completely dominate this a long time ago, 10 years ago, 10 years ago. I dated this girl that was a blackout, crazy drunk like every time, like, like her parents were drunks since she was 18. She black out every day, just drank like boone's like five bottles of beer machine when you were dating. I would say she was like 22, something like that. Twenty one, 22, something like that. And uh, I broke up with her because she uses when up like on knew like five times a day. You're just like, come on, you still to dig dick out first. And then. But no, uh, so once it was, like, it was always one of the things, like I break up with her and then I was like, Oh God, she has big tits.

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       I got you. No, no. Oh I forgot to fuck her again. But, but then one time it was like six months go by. She's trying and trying. And finally I'm like, all right, look, it's my sister's birthday this weekend we're going to go out and have some drinks if you want to come out, but you have to be cool, you know, you can't, you know, whatever. And so she came out fucking stupid. Let's black out drunk fucking embarrassing people, you know, I had to like get her in the car and so they get back to my house and I'm like, look, I'm going to bed. You can crash downstairs, uh, or, or I can call you a cab or somebody you're not allowed to drive.

Speaker 5:          00:15:47       She goes, fucking driving.

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       Start breaking my shit. Just destroying my house. I'm talking about taking picture frames and smashing it, throwing things. Like I had this huge dent in my refrigerator where she threw something at my refrigerator like, and I'm like grabbing her, like, stop, stop, get the fuck out of my house. You crazy woman. And so I opened the door, throw her outside. I literally throw, not like, hey, through our, against a brick wall or anything. I just like pushed her out the front door, slammed the door, went upstairs, went to bed and forgot all about boulder. You for. That's a bold move. I was like, you saw what if you saw the, the shit that she was doing in my. I look out the door to see where she went or not. I did not care. I was so upset because my. I assume she would just start lighting your house on fire. Yeah, I think to a point I probably look outside, see if like she walked down to her car or something like that, you know? But what she did was go to my neighbors, start banging on their door two in the morning, go

Speaker 5:          00:16:50       won't drive me home.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       I slept through it. You have to pay attention. I slept through all this. I guess the cops came online, whatever, and I was just like, I remember. Then I woke up in the morning, casually went downstairs making coffee, get a doorbell, rang the door, open the door and the go, Hey Brian. Damn, we wish you went and answered. They answered the door. We need to arrest, you know what? And they're like, well we got three charges for your arrest. I guess you wouldn't drive her home and you wouldn't let her leave the house or something like that because I wouldn't let her drive was unlawful restraint because I went in a. When you give her keys, I want to get her keys. Gets you with blackout wasted. Oh, you should have called the cops. I should've called the cops. Yes, absolutely. But when you're young and.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       Okay, so, so, so you were falsely to Sorta, you were involved in a fucked up situation. It's basically, it's a form of Karma. I mean, you, you were involved with someone who shouldn't have been involved with your instincts, are telling you to avoid them. Absolutely. The Ted sucked. It sucked me right back in. Like so anyways, I got all these charges against me and then I had to go to court spend, I think it was $20,000 in court fees. I had to go to all these different things like I went to this, had to go to a psychiatrist that they maybe go to a, and this is by the way all nicknamed the Oj Simpson Law because after the Oj Simpson trial, they now have it like a woman. If a woman wanted, she could go through the phone book and go arrest this person thing, hit me and without asking anything or anything, they have to automatically arrest that person, put them in the system.

Speaker 3:          00:18:32       Oh people this shit. Just kidding. Ha Ha. People are gonna Start Anyway. So we're not responsible for anything. So I just made that up, made that up. So I. So I had to go to like the psychiatrist and this one person, he was like the deciding factor. If this person says that they, they believe I'm a crazy woman theater, they don't have to go to trial. And so we sit down and he goes, excuse me, what was the woman's name? This is in the psychiatrist meeting. I'm like, I told her the name and they're like, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to stop this right now. I actually graduated with her. I'm going to have to get my partner in on this. And so he could interview me. And so I think it's like to the partner. I'm like, all right, this is this guy's friend, you know, that went to school with this girl.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       The Guy Sat and listened to me five minutes because yes, this does go to trial. He is out of control. And the whole time I'm like, I went home, she was going crazy. I stepped up, you know? And so then I had to go to court, this guy with like the girl or something, she went to high school, they graduated together and singing class. So he hooked it up for his friend. Well, if you work with your partner and you're like, Hey, I went to school with this girl, fuck this guy up, you know, that's probably what happened. So I had to go then go to back to court to get the judge to approve like a separate person. I have to say, look, they went to high school together and then they whispered. So then I had to go to this other view. You but you got that off.

Speaker 3:          00:19:50       Yeah. I had to go to court though. Okay, next or what? $10,000 or something like that. Then finally what happens? They dropped everything. Uh, this is like $20,000 worth of court fees going to court for about two years. They dropped everything for a. what's that ticket where you can go outside and just scream outside. Uh, uh, it's like a minor ticket. It's like a $50 tickets during the piece. Yeah. Disturbing the peace. But it's called something else. It's called something else. But I got that. Let's see if any of these fucking. What's it called? Degenerates will know what that means. Uh, yeah. But so and so it got all that drop to that end. The day Mr Jones, 9:30 says, let's hear the real story. You Chris Brown, that bitch. No, I did know. And what's funny is I have a, a mugshot and in the mug shot, I have a black guy and my nose is all fucked up because she throws something at me and hit me in the face and I didn't even know about it. So the moral of the story is, if you know crazy

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       bitch, get the fuck away from me.

Speaker 3:          00:20:49       Disorderly conduct disorder. Well, here's the, here's the funniest thing is, right, right when I did that, the next day after the trial where they ended it and say, alright, disorderly conduct, pay a ticket. Uh, she called me. She goes, I want you to know I'm so sorry about this. I actually didn't press charges or anything. The police press charges and they wouldn't let me. They wouldn't drop the charges. The true, true story. She's like, I had nothing to do with this. I was pissed off that night. That's all that happened. I went to the cop.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       It's so great. Well, that's the truth, that that is a part of the law. If you get accused of any sort of domestic violence, the police have to try the case. The law has to try the case. Yeah. He can't. Woman can't just drop it. You can't drop domestic violent cases. Yeah, pretty nutty. When you think about it, that is the problem. There's a lot of people that do a lot of fucked up things to human beings for sure. And there should be last protect people, but we don't know who's telling the fucking truth. And if you run in and bad circles and you hang out with crazy bitches, you could have a bad situation. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       So that's what sucks about this whole thing with them because they're celebrities. If all that shoot was on TMZ, Tito and Jenna, all my shit was on TMZ. That would be great.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       People would think that you're a woman beater.

Speaker 3:          00:21:57       Yeah. I've already just told you. Use. You're probably half the people there. Think I'm lying

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       your. I've never had a truck hit me. I have a check swing on me once and I ducked under and grabbed her and then I calmed her down and then it got okay after that. But I've never, you know, never been in a situation where I hated somebody worlds with them. And I hated them, but I know people have man, I know people that are in relationships with they fucking hate, you know, and it's almost always people that had really fucked up parents and it's almost always people that have parents that fought and for some reason they think that it's normal and especially when you're young, they kind of like it because they think it makes them feel like an adult, like they're doing like adult type shit. Like their parents did their fucking screaming and yelling at each other. Like there's been many times, especially when I was way, way younger in my early days for how to grip on the type of girls to date type of girls.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       If a girl is hot, I would date her. It didn't matter if she yelled at me, demean. You had to be really fucked up for me to break up with, you know, especially in Boston because it's so hard to get laid in Boston. In Boston if you're single, you fucked. It's not like too much Stevia. No, I got all grinds. I made cowboy coffee. I make coffee with a French Press and at the end of it there's, you get grinds, but I like it. It's all, it's gritty, but what, you know, it's so hard to get laid, you know, in Boston and when you're a teenager man, especially, I don't know about you, but me, when I was teaching, I had to get laid to stay sane. I had to get laid. Otherwise sex was all I thought about all fucking day. You know, nature has you primed for that nature, has it set up so that if you're not fucking okay and if you like 17, 18 years old and you're not fucking, that's all you're going to be thinking about.

Speaker 2:          00:23:39       You're not gonna be able to concentrate on anything and you can get distracted so easy. You could get registered completely removed from whatever path you're on. If you're trying to, you know, become a fucking sprinter and the Olympics are you trying to, you know, become an author. Whatever you're doing, if you're not getting laid, a girl can come in and just just fuck up the whole situation just by giving you pussy that others. But when you know you're 30 something years old and you've been around the block a few times, then then it becomes a matter of, okay, who's the dummy here? You know, who's the one who's being silly? You know, why? Why are you getting involved with these crazy bitches? This is one people need to do you. First of all, you need to get your own shit together. That's like number one.

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       You need to be a happy person and you know, a lot of people don't like weed, but here's one thing that we'd is really good for. If you smoke weed and get paranoid and you start freaking out about things, almost always those things that you freaking out about are things that are in your subconscious that you're not comfortable about. The things that had been bothering you for a long time and you've been trying to push them to the back of your head and when you smoke pot, whatever it is about pot, especially when you get too hot, what? There's some, there's a quality to marijuana that makes you think about shit that you're suppressing. It makes you think about things from your past that you don't like. It makes you think about like things that you did and it makes you think about like your own issues, you know, and especially like marijuana and the isolation tank together too. You haven't even used my tag.

Speaker 3:          00:25:06       Have you done the isolation tank lately? Have you been still doing?

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       Yeah, I always do it. Want to do it last night, but I was too tired to get up early in the morning and do radio for Montreal. I'm in Montreal. I'm May 8th. I believe something like that at the metropolis is that may. The was in May, May. It might be seventh or eight. Will show I find out. I probably. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       By the way, your twitter name is now. Joe Rogan. Yes. So it's not Joe Rogan.net anymore?

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       Yeah, there was a, I a fucking scored. I got it back. There is apparently a thing where you can, where you can, um, a report when people are hijacking your image,

Speaker 3:          00:25:47       squatting your name. You know what's funny is that when they switch it over, they just deleted Joe's Joe Rogan.net name, so they just let it free again, like so he could get a. and so I grabbed, I noticed it right away and I grabbed it, but I didn't tell John looked at him like that

Speaker 2:          00:26:03       motherfucker. Somebody got my shit. So I sent an email thing to them, a message to them saying, Hey, I will give you a, uh, an autograph DVD and a cd if you give me that.

Speaker 3:          00:26:15       I say the play that long. But I was like, I know how much you do practical jokes that was even going to do it. But it's funny because I don't know if you looked at the photo, if you go to [inaudible] dot net now in the twitter, if you look at the photo made his head more tilted so it looked gay or. So you've been working with this. It'd be like what?

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       Uh, I got it. It's uh, May 7th, May 7th. I'm in a metropolis in Montreal. So anyway, we were talking about having crazy people in your life and sex and isolation tanks, isolation tanks and get well about having good, good relationships like the best way to, to have a good relationship. You've got to be comfortable with who the fuck you are, you know, and if you've got a lot of issues, a lot of stuff that's bothering you, you know that's going to fuck up any chance you have of communicating well with other people because as soon as you get comfortable with another person, when you first meet someone, you don't really let them in and you sort of project who you want to be to this person and then the person does the same thing to you. But after like a few months or few weeks, depending on, you know, how good your act is.

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       Most people, you get to know who the fuck they really are and what their real issues are. You know, after awhile there and they start yelling at you and they get upset at you for no reason or something and you start tuning it all in and going, oh, okay, you're a fucking bananas. You know, you've got to not be bananas in order to get someone who's not banana. It's like people will do is we'll always say like, man, I'm fucking trying to find a good girl, Dude. I'm just tired. All these bitches. Meanwhile, you're a mess bro. You're a fucking man. You're a loon. You hate your Stepdad, you know you want to fucking beat dude's up at stoplights, you know you're a mess. And unless you stop being a mess, you're never going to be involved in a good relationship. You never got to be able to recognize, you know, other people that are fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       Like I've always said that one of the things about trying to be like super honest and I try to be literally as honest as possible, like it sounds really kind of gay, but I really do try to very important things. One, I try to be as nice to people as possible and be as nice as possible. I wish I could be nice to everybody, but some people are fucking obsessive and they don't leave you alone or the bananas or they're, they're retarded or their abusive or you try to take advantage of you if you're nice and there's some people that you can't be nice to. Unfortunately there's some people that you know what they need fucking years of therapy and when you run into them, you, you don't have the time for that. So you've got to go through, leave me the fuck alone, stop, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:28:26       And, and it's unfortunate you have to do that, but sometimes you have to do that. So I try to be as nice as is humanly possible to get through my life. And number two, I try to be as honest as humanly possible. I try to always be honest. I try to, uh, make sure that everything I'm doing, I'm doing from a place where I can be honest about it. And if you can't be honest about it, for the most part, it's one thing, just one thing is being honest. Another thing is like tmz type shit, like revealing all sorts of information about your personal life because people are creepy and they want to look, look into it. That's not honestly, that's like a revealing thing and I'm not really into that. I'm not really into like becoming, going on a reality show and having everybody seemed my bathroom, like what the fuck is that?

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       That's not honesty, that's just, that's just weird voyeuristic shit that people get, you know, obsessed with. But, but you know, what I am into is telling you where I'm really coming from and what's going on in my own mind and, and, and be comfortable with that to the point where I am so honest all the time that I can recognize deception like right away, you know, and I, I find that to be really true. Like if you're a really honest person, when people are full of Shit, you just fucking spot it. Like right away. It's really difficult to lie to an honest person really hard. Remember that we did we videos

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       for awhile after every video, but I was going and it really, it's fucking awesome philosophy. Me and Eddie Bravo would have a competition. Who did it? Best member tried to know I can do better. What was that all about? At least crazy. Very competitive. Very competitive, very competitive. I guess you have to be when you do that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       Yeah. Well, you know, he grew up in a situation where he had a Douche bag for a stepfather and his whole life has been trying to fight against people that are fucking with him. You know what I mean? So like he'd become, he became hyper competitive because of that. Anyway, so that's my advice. And to uh, that, that bitch ass dude that's banging Larry King's wife and running your mouth, you faggot. Turn in your man card, you little bitch of the man. That's how you're getting by in this life. You're getting your money from ratting out some woman that you fucked on her husband's bed. You silly man. You silly silly man. And apparently Larry King, it helped. This guy had gotten this guy like acting gigs, like, keep your mouth shut, son. You know why? Trying to hurt Larry King. What are you getting like 10 grand out of this. You little faggot. How much have you gotten? How much are they going to pay that guy?

Speaker 3:          00:30:55       He's probably doing it for the fame to be Spencer Pratt style. You know there's a sitcoms or it takes all these people called man carbon. They try to earn their man card back, you know, or as expensive practice guy and they all live in a house together.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       The sprints or pat is a fucking Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. There's no man. Exactly. I've seen him on the show in black belt and it's hilarious. I hate that shit. I hate that. Look, we're talking about him. That's all he wants. And He. Meanwhile I was making a living and those who have to work at 7:11.

Speaker 3:          00:31:24       If you watch the show. Sixteen and pregnant. No, I haven't dude. Apparently Eddie Bravo says, I must wash this. I'm to write this down. Bad Girls Club. Apparently bad girls club is ridiculous. Yeah, I mean it's just like the motto like 16 and pregnant even more or something. It was that big keeps coming on. Uh, whatever. Um, so what does the show? 16 and pregnant 16. The pregnancy

Speaker 2:          00:31:47       one episode and it's all white trash kids and they're yelling at their parents. Their parents are yelling at them. I was like, I don't want it.

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       It's awful. It's the worst show ever. That's like too much info. That's a perfect example. We were an Ikea though the other day and they had like a kid's room, like it was like a bunk bed and he was really happy, but then there was like a place for a baby and I'm like, wait, is this just like, you know, a poor person with only one bedroom and had this shared like sister and baby, or is this like, now this girl has a baby and she's like 15. It was the big bulk of it. It's just got a crib thing. That's what I'm saying. I'm like, what is Ikea doing doing? I think they're just trying to maximize bedroom, bedroom, trying to market to them. This is like, oh yeah, this is like for too many people, Mexicans living in an apartment or something like that, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:32:34       Yeah. Well, you know what man, with this economy being in the shitter the way it is, people are stack and more people into houses together. I know a person who lives down the street from me is losing their house, losing people, losing their houses, left and Ryan. People who, uh, have a really high falutin lifestyle and spend tons of money and you know, get used to it and get used to trying to bling bling and then the shit hits the fan. I was thinking about moving the other day. Just get sick of a place and you just want to upgrade. You always feel like you have to upgrade your shit. Oh, it's out. All my carpet have wood floors underneath it now. It looks great. Now I'm like, I'm fine. Yeah, you just needed a change. I think, you know, when I moved to Colorado that was a good thing for me to adjust to change environments.

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       I think changing is good for your brain. I think it like refine your brand, but your brand has to learn this whole new environment. I had a whole new friends, the people I run into, a Jujitsu, whole new people. I was meeting a whole new comedy clubs where I was working on my stuff. It was a very interesting to me and made me fire my brain up. I think that's a good thing to do if a shock it once. The problem is. The other thing is you build a base though. Like I have a base in la. I have all my friends live in La, my wife's friends live in La. You know, I have my whole system set up where I buy my dog food. I have, you know, the guy that works on my car. You know what I mean? I have all this shit in la where I train all the dudes that have been training with for years.

Speaker 2:          00:33:53       It's like you get like, you get real comfortable with that system and it's very convenient and when you move you gotta like re reconfigure your whole situation. The problem is women, you know, you're bringing women and then they have friends like chocolate Dale said. He goes, I can go to a sports bar. I'll never fucking hour. I've got nine new friends, Chili because he's a fucking coolest guy ever. He's super friendly. He's like, yeah, come on by. A very cliquey and beers and some guy. What do you do? I'm fucking plumber. Hey, you know, I'm, I'm this, I'm that and guys can meet guys like that. You know, like I tell the story about the one time that I hosted a Jack and Jill Strip club and, and Rhode Island. I've told you the story before, right? Yes. It was a male and a woman stripper, and it was horrific.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       There were, there were both disgusting. There was like maybe, maybe six to 10 people in the audience at most during the whole night's performance and I had to perform a bunch of times. I would go up and do stand up and then the male stripper would go on. I'll go up and do standup in. A female strip would go on and they would do shifts and they would take some time off and then I'll go on stage again and then they would start to show all over again and the woman would go up and the guy will go do everyone in the audience was like these weird people from this area, woonsocket, Rhode Island, but there was this one dude who was there who was a construction worker from New Jersey and he just happened to be in town because it was a marriage or something like that or wedding that he had to go to for when someone's family and he was bored.

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       So we've got out of the house to go have a appear. There's a bar down the street, so he goes to this Jack and Jill Strip club and he was a totally normal dude and me and him were talking having beers like what? He goes, what the fuck are we witnessing? Or You at least seen? And this was like one normal dude in May. After first two beers. It's like I had known this dude for fucking 10 years, were just joining one place to pull. Yeah, let's fucking play some pool. So there's a little corn operated pool table. Were playing pool, making fun of the whole situation. Like I found a friend like for girls. That's hard to do, man. Bitches don't trust each other. Man. I learned that from having dogs. You know, having pitbulls I had two female pit bulls and one of them killed the other one.

Speaker 2:          00:35:50       They would. They would fight and I would separate them and I thought they worked their shit out because the way dogs work, the shit out. His one dog will dominate the other dog and then you figure out who the Alpha is. They have to do that. They have to figure out who gets to drink first. Who gets to eat first? That's just the wild animal world and you have to be number one. That's why you can never let your dog get away with Shit. You can never let her get a dog growl at you. You can never let your dog do things they're not supposed to do because you have to be the Alpha, especially if you have big dogs. Well, this is what doesn't work with females. Females never accept dominance. They would always come back and try to battle it out again and that's what they did until one of them killed the other one. And I think that's how women are with women. Men. I think women can be friends with women and they have really close friends and you know, they go all sex in the city and pal around together and shit like that. But it's real difficult for them to make that kind of a bond to trust another woman that trust them. This, it's, I think it's easier for dudes, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:36:43       Yeah, I agree. I, it seems like that's like the cat fight.

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       Yeah. Especially if there's dudes that are like doing stuff that you like to do, like comics, like if I made comics, I can go to a new town and uh, you know, do stand up or there's some local complex. I'm fucking meet local comics all the time. Next thing you know, we're out having a beer together. You know, we're hanging around. We have something in common or Jujitsu guys like there's like fucking 10 dudes in Jujitsu that are trained with all the time. There could totally be good friends of mine. They're just dudes that, especially Jujitsu guys, because they have good control over the ego. You know, Jujitsu guys into to get good at Jujitsu, you have to battle it out all the time and you have to be real objective. You can't be delusional at Jujitsu. You have to really know what your strengths are, what your weaknesses are, and you've got to be able to deal with tapping out.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       You've got to be able to deal with dudes dominating you because in the beginning for sure you're going to get dominated. Everybody gets dominated the beginning. Nobody, unless you're just so big that nobody can touch you. So I'm 300 pounds, brock lesnar character, you know you're going to get tapped out at the beginning, so you have to have the kind of ego to deal with that. But for, for women, I don't know, I think it's much more difficult. It was really difficult for my wife, especially when you have a little baby and what are you going to meet some other lady as a baby and how much you going to have in common with this broad. Once she's Christian, she goes all loony toon Janya and wants to fucking talk about Noah's Ark and shit. You know? Right. Yeah. I got some guy fucking cornered me at the supermarket the other day. Some do that. I guess I had met them before, but I forgot. You know, there's some law that you can only or there's some studies that say that you can only keep like 150 people that you know in your head. And we've seen that.

Speaker 4:          00:38:19       No, I haven't seen that. But I totally believe it because I think mine's like 10 says, well let's meet or I just don't care. There's so many things when, when like, you know, like I'll meet somebody or somebody tells me something if I don't care about it. I just like, I put that on the coffee table and that's about to be thrown out, you know, putting my deep storage. I put in my random memory, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:38:44       Yeah. Here it is. This, there's a, I don't know, working memory. There's, there's a, I'm trying to find it on Google. I don't want to waste too much time looking for this, but 100, it's apparently you can only remember. You can only have real relationships where you know, 150 people were, you know, their name and you know, you'll have a certain amount of space in your hard drive when it comes to human beings. And that to me reinforces my feelings that human beings are supposed to live in small tribes. We're not supposed to live and have a gigantic fucking tribes of hundreds of millions of people.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       Well, it's also if you, if you ever get assignment says you know, like you know where you follow the colors, but it also is a. I don't know if it's a. we're supposed to live in small tribes as in if I can do. Simon says, but right up to the 14th one, my brain falls off and it's always like the 14th one. It's almost like, that's just my Max, you know, like that's my heart is full. I can't do anything past this 14. I might be able to train myself to, to like micromanage how many things I can remember. But uh, it's weird, like if I pick up a Simon says right now, once I hit the 14th one, I can't do it. Like, just turns off. Almost everybody has a different threshold for. Oh, I'm saying everyone does the same for, uh, for names. It's pretty. It's pretty. Wouldn't that fall into the same thing though? Just maybe memory, memory.

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       Well, I think, um, I think, well think about how many words you know, you know, we know thousands of words and words that we don't even use. You know, you can. I mean, you know, some of these serendipitous.

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       Yeah. That takes up more of our, most of our hard drives. Scenario art take scenario. People

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       that just spout out you only use five percent of your brain. So some random night, the only use 10 percent of Israeli really to you. Do you even know what the fuck you're talking about? Are you just like reciting some shit that someone told you in high school? Like this is the year of Glute, right? Right. And that's supposed to be just saying we'll use two percent of our Ra, you know, you don't fucking know. But uh, anyway, this dude that I met at the grocery store, I did not remember him. He said he is from Jujitsu. So I said, hey, what's up man? How you doing? So I think it's just going to be one of those casual. What's up man, how you doing things? And, and he's like a little taken aback that I don't remember him. And then he'll like laugh. So I was a girl, awkward socially.

Speaker 2:          00:41:01       So take care of my, some shopping. I'm doing all my shit and then I'm leaving and when I'm going out to my car, he hits me with Joe, you go to church. I'm like, Oh you motherfucker and I've got a car and you know, unload my food. I don't want to get the fuck home and this dude is like cornered me in the parking lot, and so I, uh, I say, no, I don't. He said, are you interested? And I say, no, I'm not. And he goes, have you talked to blank? And I don't want to say who blank is, but he is a friend of mine. And uh, he was saying that this, this guy. Has He talked to you about the Lord, this guy is fucking this guy who we're talking about this friend of mine, his fucking bananas. All right. Uh, you know, nothing wrong with cheating on your wife, but this guy like literally was planning on killing her.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       I mean, he's fucking brilliant. Yeah, it's crazy. He didn't do anything, let me go away with her and the whole day. But this guy who was talking about was like, I don't want to say anything other than. He's probably one of the worst examples you could ever possibly use. He just doesn't know the best example that I've used for religion. Well, yeah, I mean this guy, he just doesn't know that this guy's bananas because a lot of people don't know this guy's bananas, you know, but you know, so I'm like, come on man, I don't have time to break all this shit down for you. You know, if it's helping you, that's all well and good, but just running up to people and thinking you're going to save him in the parking lot because you couldn't get your shit together and you don't have to save me.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       All right, I'm pretty fucking happy. And if you really truly believe that the only way I'm going to get to go have him go to heaven as Kirk Cameron style where you have to fuck in, you have to accept the Lord. You ever seen Kirk Cameron go up to like gang bangers? You gotta look Google that Shit on Youtube. Watch Kirk Cameron's videos where he goes up to people and uses his fucking 13 year old logic uses like fucking seventh grade logic on people. When you google it, typing, Kirk Cameron owned, there's a lot of those because that's even better. Then he starts talking to people who actually read fucked. He's so. He's so bananas. I think Kirk Cameron is almost definitely gay. The more I watched them in these videos, the more I'm like this. Nothing masculine about this man. He's very submissive and is desired for chastity and this desire for, you know, for him. I met him. I think I would go over the edge and just tried to kiss him. No, no. Yeah, yeah. I pull out my dick starting to look at it, you know, just like go hit the. I would go to jail for, you know, I'm like fuck them.

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       Just hold them down. Fucking pulled them down, jerk off on his chest or something like that. See what he does. I was this time, no stop. I, I used to like him back in the day with this show and it growing. But I also thought that tracy golden was hot. So I guess I'm just stupid. Well, his wife was Super Hot, right? Or she is still stills. Wow. Oh No. He's real life. Real life is super hot. There's something the matter with that dude is chasing down the Lord, you know, I can understand you wanting to study what Christianity was. What to me in my opinion is, is an ancient philosophy. You know, it might be incredibly flawed, but there's some very good things to it. There's some very good ideas that love one another as you would love yourself, you know, be, you know, treat each other as brothers and sisters and all that stuff is very good, but it's got a lot of wacky nonsense in it that makes no fucking sense.

Speaker 2:          00:44:23       And if you really want to study it, if that's your thing, look, it's just, there's nothing wrong with people studying like Greek mythology, you know, like getting into like Zeus and Mithra and all that crap. That's kind of cool. It's interesting, but when you really get into like Christianity and start thinking that this is the real stuff, like this is the what the fuck are you talking about? And then you're got to grab other people and you need to listen to me. You need to listen to me. It's all parents though, you know? I would never have thought that if my parents were when I was a kid though. Some people know though, again, some people are born again so that it's not their kid or it's not their parents. Yeah. But those are really hard to be born. I never learned it growing up and then going straight into it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       I think it is of your life falls apart. I think if your life falls apart and all these people that are into Jesus seem happy and they seem like they have a path because that's really what it's all about, man. You know, you have to have a path and today people, if you, if you think about the way we used to live, the way our bodies are programmed to live, I mean we're supposed to be living in fucking huts and caves and shared. I mean the, the hardware that we have right now is basically the same hardware, the same adrenal system, the same neuro synapses that connect the same way as people that lived 100,000 years ago. If you took a person from 100,000 years ago and sat them in the corner right there, he would be unrecognizable. I mean it would be totally normal.

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       You wouldn't say like, what the fuck? That's a caveman now. He would look just like us, but yet 100,000 years ago they had very different needs. Man. There was a. You couldn't. You had shit. You had to do. You had tasks. Okay. You had to go out. You gotta find that fucking food every day you had a hunt. That shit down. That's what it's like a visceral thrill involved in hunting. Like hunters will tell you, if you ever watch like Ted Nugent, talk about it. A key makes it very appealing and Brock Lesnar, he's got videos with him hunting like it's a rush he gives. These guys are rushed to kill the animal and get their meat and it's not like a a cruelty rush and they're there. They want to kill and fucking hurt and destroy. No, it's. It's a man is supposed to be out there shooting animals and killing them.

Speaker 2:          00:46:24       You ever plant food and then eat that food? There's something very exciting about that. Very, very rewarding and fulfilling and to a lot of people. Their life is filled with nothingness. There's no task everyday. It's a show up at work. Do what you're told. Do your paperwork, stare at the clock, beg for 5:00, get the fuck Outta here. Listen to your wife, bitch. Have a beer. Watch law. Say what the fuck is going on? Fall Asleep. Do it all over again. There's no tax, there's no real, there's no real. So there has to be some meaning to it all. So someone comes up to you and says, Hey man, I know you feel that way. I used to feel that too until I met the Lord. That emptiness in your life is that you don't have the Lord. When really that emptiness in your life is just you're fucking hardware and it's just your hardware. You know? Do you think about the way we're wired? We are not wired to deal with this world that we live in right now. We are wired to deal with thousands of years ago, 18, 30 something was when they figured out the camera. That means everything before, less than 200 years ago. If you want to know what someone looked like, someone had a draw

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       that person for you. Do you think it how crazy that is? They had a draw your how many fucking people can draw. I mean, how many? How many people do we really know from before? 1,800. What they really looked like. It's fucking guesswork. Unless you were Napoleon Napoleon. We have hundreds of drawings. That guy, we got a pretty good idea what he looked like. Abraham Lincoln. Pretty good idea what he looked like. You know, but you don't go way, way, way back 500 years ago with the fuck black people didn't exist back then. You know, white people have only existed for a short amount of time. You know, there was a recent study where they figured out how long white people around, I believe it was like $10,000

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       years or something silly. Let me see. I'm going to google that because that's an important thing. How long have Caucasians

Speaker 3:          00:48:17       see? I think black people came before white people and I'm sure I'm sure a lot of people don't believe that you think black people came from art kind of way, like using pallets and colors. It has to go that way, you know, so yeah, you make, you have, you can't go that way. You know, black turns into white but white, it's not going to turn in black in color wise if you're mixing colors.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       When did people evolve to be white? What we do I work for, uh, when did people change become white? Let's see, why do people come up? Why did people become what? Alright, that's why vitamin D probably you're saying between 100,000, 50,000 years ago, lower levels of vitamin vitamin D at higher latitudes where the sun is less intense, caused the lightening effect where modern humans became who were, uh, who began darker skin first migrated north. So human beings have been black until about 50,000 years ago when we started moving around. And then the climate changed. That's pretty fucking chain, can you pretty crazy shit. So there's banana had tried to convert me into Jesus, at least.

Speaker 6:          00:49:37       At least with Jesus, you're allowed to fucking draw a picture of him. How nutty is the fucking South Park? Dang. Did you watch the episode? Yeah, both of them. No, I couldn't watch it. It was driving me crazy. I was so mad at comedy central for beeping out every. No. Go see the first one, they didn't do anything on the first one. The second one because the first one. It's so annoying though when you see every time they say Mohammed it beeps. And then how about when he's in a fucking the bear suit and it comes out with Santa Claus and the bear suit, like did the first episode he was in a u haul and it's was like, like legally that's what they thought that they wouldn't get in trouble. Right. So they just drove, they drove Mohammed around in a u haul. He just sit there like, is this okay? Mohamad bub?

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       No.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       Pendula said something on his twitter today, and I'm paraphrasing, but basically said the measure of a religion is a how much you, you're afraid. You know, what way you can say about a religion is how much you are afraid to talk about them or when you're afraid to talk about them, like how crazy they are. Basically what he's saying. And Penn is a very staunch atheist and I've been friends with that guy for a long time and he doesn't, he won't even consider the possibility that there's some sort of an intelligent life to it all. He's very scientific, but, you know, unfortunately he's never done any psychedelic drugs. And if, if he had, he's never done anything. He's never had a drop of alcohol. He's never even had a single drug except for when he's had to have surgery when they had a drug. Um, he like takes it very seriously to be sober all the time. We saw well and good, but I think, you know, you can't really understand what's happening in the psychedelic experience unless you've had one, you know, point is this fucking Mohamad thing, man.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       It's that. I like how they compared it. I don't know if they did in the second episode and the first thing they compared it to a the Tom cruise suing anyone that says he's gay. It's kind of like the Muhammad thing. You know what? You're not allowed to talk about him being gay. Listen, I'm going to tell you right now. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       You talked about being gay, being gay all day long at Cox. If you go online, there's pictures of me with dicks all over the place. That's the golden rule. The Internet. Right, so that a picture of you on the Internet somewhere. Someone is photoshop

Speaker 3:          00:51:51       when you're making love South Park though. I was watching this show. I was watching orgasmic last night. I don't know if you've ever seen that one. It's a movie at Trey Parker wrote and directed and stuff and where he's a mormon and he gets into porn, but that alone is a great movie. How they're always battling religion and trey is at least something that it's just a fucking love.

Speaker 1:          00:52:09       They're the best. They're the best. They're the most prolific there. Shows the best. It's the mall to speak to Mike Sense of humor the most. It's silly, but it's spot on and brilliant. Just the fucking Barbara streisand dinosaur monster, you know, machine thing that they had.

Speaker 3:          00:52:26       Do you ever see a day? I don't know. I think I've told you this before. There used to be a website called shock wave.com. Used to be shocked, raved.com, which was a bunch of flash movies and stuff and they originally paid trey Parker and Matt Stone. Some crazy amount of money, but I saw it. What was. It was a show called princess and what it was is they were paid tons and tons of money to do and they were like uncensored. They were like, you could do whatever you want, uncensored. This is going to be big on the Internet and we're going to give you like $30,000 an episode or something like that. And so they hired tray and math to do the series. If I have 24 episodes, they got to the second one turned it in. We're like, wow, this is great. And they're like, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       We sit on sensor. But this is, this is out of control too far. If you go online and have it on my website, [inaudible] dot com. Uh, just google, uh, princess, uh, Trey Parker or princess red band, you will find it. And what it is, is it just, it's all about this fluffy little dog. It like a Shitzu and it just sits there and it starts off. It's like all about this dog and then it's just like crazy stuff's going on in the background that just cute dogs watching, like watching two people. Fuck, it's watching somebody get murdered. It's like, it's like it's a about this cute little cute little dog watching all this horrific shit. And it only got the two episodes and based, even though they said they were led to the meeting they wanted, they're like, this too fucked up. We quit. No, you guys keep the money. You can't. You can't do this anymore. It's the best, best videos I've ever seen in my life. And I wish Trey Parker and Matt Stone would finish that because it was one of the funniest things. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:54:02       Ever seen. Those guys are so crazy. They're the craziest, they just take things the deepest, you know, like I remember when we saw team America, I remember being in a theater, gone, I can't believe where they're going with this. I can't, you know, when, when, when the dude starts throwing up and keeps throwing up,

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       that's where it's like, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       Oh fucking football field full of puke and he's laying in the center of it. I mean they took it to the utmost. They took it to its total shock humor, but brilliant shock humor, you know, like it's not as funny the second time around, like the throw up seen the thrust and the first time around when you don't know it's coming. It's just God damn. It's funny. It's like one of the best there. If they have a movie coming out, I'm always more excited than anything else except them in Bora Bora or dam and Ology like close. So

Speaker 3:          00:54:50       I don't know if it's ever going to work on me anymore. I wonder what he's doing now. I wonder if there's like a third movie because I know that

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       off. Maybe if it takes time off, if he goes to places where people aren't aware of it, like if he goes to like the south, like that's what we try to do before I try to go to the south.

Speaker 3:          00:55:06       Well it's almost like the, like Mike Myers, it's falling. It fell in the same category. I watched, you know, like the last gold finger movie or whatever he did. He's just playing the same character over and over again. And the other day I watched one of my old favorite movies was. So I married an ax murderer and I used to love that movie. I've watched you the other day. I wanted to fucking puke and beat people up because it was so awful. Like Mike Myers to me as died almost. They do

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       his last movie looked like, like you know those movies where they have a guy who used to be funny and then all the sudden, like in the movie he takes a terrible turn and now he's not funny anymore. It's putting out crap. And the were shaking their heads and ease and the downward spiral of life. That last movie where he played the Indian guy the love. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:48       Grew gold member. Whatever the fuck. I love girl. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       Watch the ads for that. You're like, okay, what is funny about this? This is like antifungal. It's like this is like a guy who forgot what funny is. It's just like,

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       but what's crazy is if you go back as far as swipe merit and ax murder, which was way before Austin powers or any of that stuff, it destroyed that movie because that was the same character as all his other movies. It was so awful. It's, it's man. Can you imagine like Timpson Wayne's world worries coming out.

Speaker 2:          00:56:22       Shrek. Shrek guy. Wayne's world was fucking genius. Him and Dana Carvey were awesome. I mean when, when those movies were on the wrong though. I mean that. Those were great, great fun, fun movies, but the new stuff he does like, I don't even like the Austin powers movies. I never got it. I. It's not my shit. Did you hear about the iphone leak? If you don't know about this iphone, the iphone four, the came out and it's like some crazy ass new iphone with a front facing camera and well apparently some dude and this is the store and a lot of people think that this is all bullshit and hype and it's just, you know, making the uh, the iphone story bigger. I personally don't because I don't think apple would ever release a thing on purpose, you know, and have people find it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:08       Lot of the companies did this though. Not a lot of companies a virus. The viral marketing nowadays that's being used on the Internet is so amazingly deep in like you would not think of the shift that's happening, right? Chocolate down the reebok commercial. Exactly where he's native and all that stuff. I mean, it's ridiculous. I could almost see this to build hype with cell phones because if you look at, there's a website called boy genius report dot Com and you could totally tell this guy's in bed or he was in bed with blackberry at one point. Like there was times where it was like, all right, you got this phone like a year ahead of anybody else and you already have and already a video of using it and stuff like that. That seems a little fishy that your friends let you borrow it. And when it comes out like a year later, you know, there's.

Speaker 4:          00:57:53       And I almost think it's just shifting the leaked out, kind of like on the Internet, you're going to see what people's reactions are trying to tweak things. You know, it's almost like we're the, you know, some of them are living, I'm sure. So don't believe know about this apple thing though, that it seems to me like the dude got fired. Didn't get fired. Yeah. He got fired. Police are involved now. You hear about the Gizmodo God, they broke down his house. He broke down his fucking front door, took all his computers because the reporter that that recorded, well, he got a copy of it. They paid $5,000

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       dollars for the, for the actual phone. So they paid money for the phone and apparently apple saying that that's their stolen property and you're not supposed to be having that reporting on it. So they went to the guy's house who wrote this whole report, broke down his house, took all of his fucking computers to two servers servers in his house. That's a super geek.

Speaker 4:          00:58:39       Yeah. Well he is a super geek. I mean the main editor of one of the biggest tech websites, not only is he get free shit, but I'm more interested in is imagine somebody coming to your house, taking your computer and took everything. That's why it freaks me out or to because a computer and nothing to do with the self. I think nowadays that's one of the most scariest things ever. Ever. Somebody can now come in and take your diary and put it into their database, your whole diary. Never. Where do you ever think like, okay, the cops just came and took my diary. Now they know everything about me. Every feeling, every thing I'm thinking now. That's what our computers, our diaries now. Yeah. You get all your emails from like a fucking million years. So this Guy Bob and iphone and now his diary is owned by the every photo you've ever

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       taken, all as computers. Like why do they think that they can just take your computers? Is it to get a um, a, like a, a track tracking of the emails to see like, you know, I think it's an open door that if they can, they can

Speaker 3:          00:59:37       pretty much just like searching your car. The cops want to search a car regardless. Even if they're just trying to pull you over for a seatbelt, they want to search a car and see what else I can find.

Speaker 2:          00:59:45       But I mean the, the, the, a lot of people are saying that this warrant was unlawful and that they shouldn't have.

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       It's totally online. La. Are you sure? Are you a lawyer? It's a cell phone. Somebody bought A cell phone from another step.

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       Right. But they bought a stolen cell phone, a cell phone that's basically stolen property. I mean the guy lost his cell phone, but it's the property of apple and it's very sensitive property because it's a prototype. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. But I think basically they fucked up in, in stealing the phone or in buying the phone. What they should have done is given the fucking phone back to apple. I mean the company doesn't want you reviewing their shit before it's out yet. I mean, I don't think that's a, a huge request. If you know that it's there, they're shit. You're doing something illegal.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       I think they more fucked up. Gizmodo, more fucked up. Just letting everyone know who the guy who lost his putting his face on the websites and everything. That's fucked up man. You know that's

Speaker 2:          01:00:39       do though was going to get busted. Anyone that was fucking phone anymore. Yeah. Really what they should've done it. They knew all this shit is given back as god damn phone

Speaker 3:          01:00:46       I think. Or the way they should have done is it's like, oh shit. It's just a cell phone. I would chill the fuck out. It's got a front facing camera now. You know how domino's is all going to sound october. We're like, everyone's got it now.

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       Crush att and t service. If you think atd service sucks, a big bag index. Now wait till that front facing camera comes out and everyone everywhere is going to be fucking use streaming while they're driving the car. Talking, sitting in the fucking black guy piece. I got a feeling

Speaker 2:          01:01:18       it's good. It's going to be a million fucking people doing that all over the. Of turning it on like I've always said that that's going to be the end of the world is when everyone has their own channel and everyone basically is like a walking television channel and instead of like, hey, what's your fucking facebook page? CAn I facebook you? What's your twitter? It's going to be what channel is your life? You're going to have a fucking helmet on and it's going to be a front facing camera that shows you as you're walking through the world and you know you're going to have a video camera broadcasting everything. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       That's kind of like what you stream does and whitening like justin tv does. Justin tv originally was called lifecasting, which was 24 hours a day falling around. Justin who? I had a camera filming his whole entire life.

Speaker 2:          01:02:00       Do you remember when we were in san francisco and justin tv was going to give us a laptop and a backpack. I was really weird connection. That was really weird. So strange with the dude who came to the show with it.

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       No, we're going to hook you all up and then we'd go to lunch and he goes, this is the laptop, this is the camera. All right. And then like put it back in is like, what were we supposed to there? Was there a. Was going to get it all to us

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       and we started making fun of it. Oh that'S right. We weren't. We were like, what if it cuts out? This is silly, this current backpack around like what am I going to do? And we decided that it would be ridiculous and they were like, didn't want to be like broadcast shows. I have enough problems with people. You tubing my shit before it's done at shows. Like when you come up with new bits, you know, like sometimes when a bit like is out and it's not a cd, you know, that's to me when it's an old bit. But if I got bits that aren't on, they haven't been on television have been seeded annual urge you to have good, you know, like you've seen it. How have you seen it? So I also saw youtube clips some asshole and the audience is videotaping it now people are saying that like it's old material.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       I'm like god damn, it isn't even done yet. It's not done. You know like you can't. So like when they were like, well we want to use stream, you know, your, your whole show mike, you can't use tree my show because when the material comes out I want at least the majority of people you know, to watching the television show other than the people that have seen me in the clubs, I wanted to be new shit. I want it to the dvd to be all shit that's not on another dvd and it's not going to work that way if there's fucking these ustream clips. And justin tv shows eveRywhere and so I thought the whole thing was too much, you know, and it's not that entertaining to like to, to broadcast every fucking thing you do. I mean with this show, like I think we sit down, we do it for two hours, we're Banging out and that's it. You don't want to just keep having content where you're watered down what people,

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       but you have no personal life. They used to be a website called gab, gab.com. I used to be addicted to, which was about maybe eight years ago, was this girl named gabriel gabriel. And she's an author in New York city and she livecast herself via webcam where would like refresh every 10 seconds because it was when the internet was new. Oh, you know, now he's like, that was actually kind of cool back in the day. So would have three cameras that would just refresh every 10 seconds. But I got addicted to watching it because it was so weird. She would come home, talk to the husband, would make dinner, then they would bring the camera into the bedroom and have sex. That's the part I liked the most, so I'll watch them. Bang, bang. Completely naked. Was this when people couldn't record things on? Yeah, this is way before that, but it was so addicting and the one day she just left and it felt like she broke up with us, beaten off just right. Like if you turned it on there in the middle of stroke, 15 seconds later, stroke, they stopped.

Speaker 2:          01:04:48       Someone stopped answering the phone or something like that. Yeah, I mean there was a show. Do you remember that movie with William Baldwin? I think it was like william, maybe Sharon Stone or something. A splinter. I think it was called. It was about those people that have their. I think that's moving out. Was there. Wasn't there a movie where a these peoples all their whole lives before mtv, like somewhat. Maybe I've got the premise totally wrong, but like something like mtv is a perfect example. Member ed tv mean that basically predicted the rise of the kim kardashians type shows. I mean basically that's what that show was like and people in the movie was like so ridiculous. The idea that people would just broadcast their entire lives, like how ridiculous I look at this. And in the end the message was that it's too much. you know, the message was that it fucked up this guy's life.

Speaker 2:          01:05:38       He had to stop doIng it to get his shit together. Totally. meanwhile, there, there's more of those goddamn shows than ever. They're real now. It's funny how many things from the past, whatever sliver. That's it. Yeah. It's funny how many things in the past were um, the that people predicted or like a real part of life now that were like ridiculous back then. like this idea of mtv doesn't, that's a real part of our life now. You know, I mean, it makes you wonder about like mad max and shit like that. And that's when, when peak oil comes and people are fucking, you know, driving a bio diesel cars down this tree. They made fucking corn fuel out of and fucking shooting at people trying to get fresh water. You know, I wonder if that really could go down like that.

Speaker 6:          01:06:21       I think so. I totally believe that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:25       Read that and talk about your tooth. Oh, they want to consign missed brian miss last week's podcast because he was.

Speaker 6:          01:06:32       Have you ever. Have you ever chipped a tooth or a filling? Fallen out of your mouth and you could feel the air go inside your tooth and hit your fillings? Fall out. Will you bid a spoon? Right? Well, yeah, I'm used to eating with plastic spoons, but uh, I ran out of plastic spoons so I went back to real spoons and I forgot and I always chew on the plastic spoon. Why do you chew on a plastic spoon? Like when I'm on, like on the internet or whatever. I'm just like, she wanted, you know, like I'll, I'll eat yogurt and has, it'd be that kind of like chewy, but I forgot it wasn't a plastic spirit inside. It's like crunch and like, that's not smart dude. Be chewing on. It still hurts. I have to go back in a month to get a real thing.

Speaker 2:          01:07:15       That's, that's ridiculous, son. That's not good. Um, what else I want to talk about? Oh, some dudes are certainly from noah's ark.

Speaker 6:          01:07:24       Is this the same people that found it? show show one people? Yeah, there's a. is that. Was that joe show show number one?

Speaker 2:          01:07:31       Yeah, there was one that we did from atlanta. You could find it on the internet if you could find a red band.com, right?

Speaker 6:          01:07:36       Yeah. Or it's show show google joe show a all one word

Speaker 2:          01:07:40       arc. Yeah. Joe rogan. Noah's ark. But anyway, there was a dude back. Dan said that he had found no ark and now apparently there's a group of evangelists that claim they've seen noah's ark. Have you seen the photos of it? Now? It's kind of interesting. Let's see it. I'll show it to you. Stupid.

Speaker 6:          01:07:59       So you're going to send me photos of a boat. I'm supposed to. I believe it's a big foot lift on this boat.

Speaker 2:          01:08:05       Well, you never know. Stranger things have happened. The crazy thing about these ideas of world floods is that there was no world communication back then. So how do you know the flood wasn't

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       just in your neighborhood, you know, and you think that it was a, you know, you think that it was somewhere else. I think that it was everywhere around the world, like you really don't have any idea.

Speaker 6:          01:08:28       Damn. Look at you and you're following 100. Almost 110. One. Oh, nine, five, nine, seven son. Very nice. Uh, uh, you know, it's funny. It's my space. I logged in the other day and I've been losing friends like thousands and thousands at a time. It's ridiculous. Everyone's deleted or myspace account. I'm reallY thinking about maybe doing it. I'm thinking of deleting mine too. I just don't want to remember those days. Anyway. That is my space days. Yeah, it's pretty silly, right? Yeah. It's like having a kid that you just need to cut off strings or something. I can't find the article. Oh wow. I, I, I'll look at a picture of a boat. It's not even a boat. It's like some would that have found. The funny thing is, is one picture that's really clear with this guy inside out. It just says this is know as arc. It's pretty interesting because this guy is standing inside something

Speaker 7:          01:09:24       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       Yeah. See, look at this. What is that? This guy claims that that sees inside noah's ark. Isn't that a photo from noah's ark ministries international? I'll, I'll throw this link up. Uh, if you just google it looks like my face was arc. If you just google they found noah's ark. You could see it. This is the noah's ark thing we're talking about.

Speaker 6:          01:09:54       Ate that shit. It's so. It's so annoying because I have certain people in my real life that believe all this shit and so they put it on facebook and I have to, like, it hurts me to read. It's just start trolling them. I got trolled.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       But the girl that pretended that she wanted to convert her friend to, uh, from uh, being um, the girls hindu, you know, that video that I put online of her and adobe friends are trying to convert the hindu girl and to being christian. Well apparently it's a giant troll. This girl scott like, oh, it's Brilliant. It's really good. Like she totally seemed like it wasn't over the top at all. I mean it was like, it was very much like jesus camp or any of that stuff that, you know, that's real, you know. So tell us your kenny, how much you mean to tell about your store, the story about your sItuation with the religious people that are go wacky on you about a certain thing in your life.

Speaker 6:          01:10:49       I'm talking about. They're talking about that, but you've got a lot. You got a lot of religious people in your life. Yeah, I got a lot and I'm doing like the exact opposite of what they would enjoy to were combining. Yeah, exactly. Did you, um, did you watch the fights this weekend? No, I did not. I didn't even know where to put lots of the face. Where was paper review and it was a very ufc

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       did it feel like the us exactly what to ufc. But it was like that. I dunno, I dunno, I, I would love to keep doing atlanta doing commentary for the lighter weights. I think those guys need more. They deserve more credit. They're more action packed or fucking those fights are crazy and right now they're like in this like shadow organization of the ufc. It's a small organization, doesn't get nearly as much attention as the ufc and uh, I wish we absorbed them, you know, I wish we had a. If it was up to me, I mean obviously it's not as a lot of business contracts and all sorts of jazz, but it would be the coolest thing in the world to be able to call those lighter weight fights. Man. Uriah favorite fought jose aldo in the main event for the featherweight title. You're my favorite.

Speaker 2:          01:11:56       Got he got beat up, got kicked the shit out of his legs. It's incredible fight. If you watch it, it was more incredible live watching it because, uh, this dude just picked your favorite part man. He just arrived. Favor. I mean, some people gave him around. I think. I don't know what they were thinking because basically in my opinion, although that's dominated every single round and at a certain point in time just to had them mounted in a crucifix, just punched him in the face for like a minute and a half. It Was ridiculous. I mean he just completely dominated favor and favor is a fucking beast, man. A beast just couldn't stop the leg kicks. Leg checks kept coming, you know, all those. So god damn fast. Although used to be a real serious soccer player too. He played semi professional soccer and those soccer players, man, they have incredible legs I think can move really good.

Speaker 2:          01:12:40       Their works really good and they kick really hard and he's just so good at moving in and out. You know, soccer is all about moving side to side. Quick moves to deal with the ball and those guys that are real good at soccer man, that really translates well to be able to kick, you know, throwing leg kicks and, and, and, and getting out of the way of leg kicks and just the ability to spring forward and spring back. Soccer's a fucking, a tremendous, a place to start, tremendous base for certain types of fighting, especially for like more time. You know, you guys say tito ortiz and channel. We already talked about that. But you're going to have to go to the uh, recording shit son. You can't be talking about it over and over. How loud were those leg kicks? The thing about leg kicks is the goldbergs was talking about that it's not slap.

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       It's a thump. The ones that are really hard don't, they're not as loud because of like say if you hit someone's thigh with your open hand like that and slap the skin of his thought, it'd be really loud. But If you hit their thigh with a baseball bat, it would be like a midi thump in the midi. Thumps are a lot more painful. What it is, the shin just digging into the meat of the leg and it fucking hurts. Like hell. It's you. You really can't appreciate how bad a leg kick hurts. Unless someone likes you, someone good, you know, you get like some fucking melvin men who've type character. Some are nesto who's type due to slam a leg kicking your leg. You realize like, god damn, it's so fucking painful and that's what this guy's move was. He just kicked his legs out from under him until he was useless from the second round out. He was pretty much useless. It was. It was sad.

Speaker 6:          01:14:15       No, but mohammed south park thing. I really liked how the. The, the extremeness website kept on getting hacked. Did you see that? Oh, the islamic islamic. Yeah. Yeah. What was their name? Radical islam. They were from New York, right? Yeah. Fucking traitors. Ridiculous. The idea that you don't mean that's taken nutty to a whole new level. Yeah. You can't even show our guy in a picture or will fuck. not even a drawing, a stick figure that even look like a stick figure, but. Oh, you didn't see it? I didn't see the first episode. They drama mohamad and it pulled up or a second. It was just like a stick figure, but it was like a circle align and like some kind of wiggly coming out and it went like this. They just showed up like that and that's muhammad. It's incredible. It's incredible. But here we are,

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       2010 and there's people out there that really believe that you shouldn't have a drawing that represents their, their, their guy, their messiah, their profit. And the funny thIng is, is fucking guy. I said that once and this guy emailed me, hey, dumb ass. The reason why you're not allowed to, It's because they don't want. You're worshiping false idols and imagery. Like, okay, I'm a dumb ass. So you think it's okay to kill people because someone's drawing some fucking guy that may or may not have even existed. Uh, you know, you can't. When you go back a couple of thousand years was mohammed like 1500 years ago. When you go back like a thousand years plus, man, who the fuck knows what really happened is I want to draw mohammed real quick while you're talking to it. Managers die. No, I want to draw it again. Have no, you don't have anythIng to do about this. I have no, no, no. Say I could not stop him. It's just your mom and. Yes. This is brian's version of mama. Does this dispersion. Muhammad is not sanctioned by ustream?

Speaker 6:          01:16:02       No, I think it is sanctioned as they invest this. No, no. Got it. Okay. This is muhammad. That's incredible. Yes. That's very lifelike. Yes, but here's muhammad with a mustache just in case I forgot. I guess drawing was probably way more important a couple of hundred years ago for photos. How do you think everybody knew how to draw? I think people knew how to draw better. But you think like if someone like someone raped you, you had the right? Yeah, because like how bad is people's memory? You know, how many people had been arrested for shit because of eye witness reports and you know, people make this eyewitness report and then they arrest someone sand that. Sam and it turns out they were totally wrong and then they apologize. I'm so sorry. And the person does like fucking 15 years in jail. You know, back then. What the fuck did they do? What do they do back then? You know, they, they found the stones that look like the rape. This stone, this trade for assembled, if theY just had a box of stones, which one looks most like your race? You know, I love people that are like really into ufos and shit and like say they talk about images that are around like cave walls.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       I've given seen the images on cave walls. They're like flying saucers and aliens on the cave walls. Like no. Or know those fucking. How do you know? Those guys didn't just eat a mess on mushroom trip. Their balls off. Just start drawn loony show. it comes to them.

Speaker 6:          01:17:23       Well what if it's like a children's book for their small kid come from this guy with free elk. We don't know what the fuck they're drawing. You just found some scribbles on a wall. If you found some of my drawings, you'd be like, what? That guy looked like a.

Speaker 1:          01:17:43       There was people that look lIke dicks. Get that. You see that hand and that are not that one little that bolo that. The drawing pad. That's some shit found found from my high school years. Yeah, that's awesome. This is from when I was 15. It's crazy. I'll put some scan all this shit in their online or you are 100 times better than I. I was and I did it all the time. This was like, this is from when I was a kid. It is a super cat. Huh? Oh shit. Like some shit that I drew. I used to draw a lot is loosely used to, uh, that's what I really used to wanna be is a, an artist for a comic book. So 1982. So I guess I was 15, 19, 82. I was eight years old. Older than you son. I love how all your shit's monsters. Just scared of monsters, man. Yeah. Goldilocks and three bears. I'm going to have to do something because I don't really draw anymore. Sweet. Don't. Here's a wolf. I was always into werewolves. That's why I was so bummed out that uh, that benicio del toro movie fucking sucked because it did fucking act like it didn't happen. Is that waterfall ninjitsu like this one peeinG on the bed. Pain over the bed, ping from the bed. Ping.

Speaker 6:          01:19:16       It's like describing the bed is like being on the. This might be a project that I had to do for school.

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       I got in trouble all the time because it was when I was on the wrestling team, I drew the wrestling logo for our high school wrestling when, um, when I was as well. I also drew the logo for our, um, our school. We had like tee shirts for newton, south red lion. So I drew the line. I used to do that too. I did the worth, the worthington kilborne official bungee jumping and shirt, which is a cardinal bungee jumping. But uh, um, that's another one that's funded from a picture from. There's an old uh, I think it was long. Chaney junior or no, I don't remember which one. Which werewolf moving. Maybe it was oliver marijuana. I don't know which one it was. Oh, that's bad ass dude. Look how good it look. Color. You're going to color the drew. But uh, before here's humpty dumpty.

Speaker 1:          01:20:14       Humpty dumpty. The ax murderer. I drew a lot of. Should put the other signature book. Yeah. I'll do something with conan, conan the barbarian. Nancy. That's amazing. Some another werewolf I was fucking obsessed with. Werewolves, for whatever fucking gary's. And that's how I just, uh, I've always loved the wolf man werewolf though, wasn't like your father and you know, I think I was an angry kid. I was always obsessed with the idea that you could, uh, I think it would represented to me was like, you know, that you can be calm and normal and then some shit happens on just right now. Maybe that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to fucking hulk out on people and turn into a werewolf, kill motherfuckers. I don't know when you're an angry kid, that's never good. But I, um, I w I told me wanting, wanted to be a comic book artist, but my high school art teacher was a douche bag.

Speaker 1:          01:21:10       He was just so suppressive and annoying and unhappy and had no joy. There was no happiness. This man, everything was serious. Like his art was serious and you know, and he would draw on. I didn't think he was talented. He was like, he would draw like boring shit, you know, he would like draw like pears and stuff, you know, like a bowl of fruit bowl, always gay faggot, you know, I've got a camera. If I want to see fruit, I'll take a picture of it. Let me see. You got a photo of wolverine fighting spiderman now shut the fuck up because that's what I like. And he was telling me that what I liked was like Juvenile and then it was like foolish and that like my car and I was like, you're just suppressing what I like, you know, I like watching fucking monster movies.

Speaker 1:          01:21:53       I like reading comic books. Is there something wrong with that? It's just entertainment. I hate when people pretend that they're entertainment somehow or another is more valid or more sophisticated just because it's like serious, you know, like people who love serious movies like [inaudible], like, you know, don't be so serious when it was like whatever man, are you learning something when you go to see like, like, you know, some depressing sean penn movie? Are you learning something when you go to see those moments? And nikki in touch with my emotions, joe, it was that river movie, whatever the fuck river runs through it. No, the sean penn won boss Mr. Rivers or whatever. But it was like, you know, and everybody's like, it's such an important film. Like

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       what? What? What's, what? Film is important. Okay. They're fucking movies man. You go to a movie and enjoy yourself. You have a good time. It takes you someplace. It gives you some thrills. You know, you, there's a lot of shit you don't know what's happening. Things get resolved. How's this going to. What's going to go down? That's all it is. It's fucking entertainment. And the idea that your entertainment because it represents like things that happen in real life as somehow or another superior to like superheroes are monsters. Like please just.

Speaker 1:          01:23:02       I had a good art teacher like I. It's funny because I got. I'll get seasoned, he's in class because I would

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       sleep except for art, which I straight a pluses took every class. but my teacher was cool and like a lot of my paintings I look back and I'm like, wow, she let me do this. One was called pool table on acid and she gave me an a minus and it was just a pool table with a monster coming out of it and everything was melting. Why noT? I didn't have to draw it. She didn't make me do it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:27       My teacher used to say shit to me. Like, you know, like, well, you know what? If you get a job where you have to draw a baby for a diaper commercial, I want to see you draw a baby for a diaper commercial. And I'm like, oh man,

Speaker 4:          01:23:40       why are you fucking draw a baby for a diaper

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       commercial? Like, is that my future is what I have to look forward to drawn diaper ads. Like he was like real, like my dream was to do comic book illustrations and he was telling me basically you need to have skills because you're not going to reach those dreams and what if you have a job that's just you as an illustrator doing boring stuff where you have to drop boring stuff. And I was like, You fucking buzz kill, you know, and this guy was just a dumpy physically out of shape. Unhealthy person and he was just depressed all the time and so I killed my effectively I, I went, I only went for two years to our, our class, I believe it was 14 and 15. I think by the time I went into my junior year of high school, I think I said, fuck that guy. I'm tired of this is annoying. So I just drew on my own from then on it that effectively killed my, my wanting to uh, go to school for art. I was looking at art colleges and shit and had scholarships lined up and trying to figure out where to go. So that's the only thing I had a chance of getting any sort of scholarship. Then meanwhile it's just teachers, you know, you don't realize what a gigantic fucking effect having a good or a shitty teacher can have on. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:24:59       but don't, you know, they're cutting their salaries over and over again. I just saw they're cutting it again and I think teachers should be one of the most important things ever, you know, like up there with doctors. ThAt's junk. Canton. yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:25:11       It's amazing how we were so short when it comes shortsighted when it comes to that.

Speaker 4:          01:25:16       Yeah. what is that? You're raising the child from the beginning. That should be the most them

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       important thing. It should be huge. People that can influence your children and people that say mean shit. Like I will never forget. I had a math teacher in high school who was just fucking boring and the class was boring and she was this black lady hood, a black accent. Like she would mispronounce words all the time. She had terrible grammar and yet she would like shit all over you if you didn't understand her, her, her math problems and she was in there doing her math problem and I was bored and I was like drawing or something. They usually, that's what I do in class and we'll draw my notebooks and stuff like that and she goes, she looks up and she sees me not paying attention. So she goes, mr rogan, would you like to come up here and do both of these for the class? And I said,

Speaker 6:          01:26:05       do you want me to do both of those problems? And everybody started fucking and so she said, go down to the dean's office right now. I said, okaY, but when I get back I'm going to do both of those problems. Mean eveRybody was laughing. She goes, go ahead and laugh and mr rogen, mr welbourne ain't going nowhere. He's going nowhere in life. And I'm like, at least I know how to say both get out of my classroom. And she kicked me out of that. So

Speaker 2:          01:26:29       that was like the beginning of my time as a standup comedian because I felt like I was defending myself. Like I wasn't doing anything to you. I'll just sitting there scribbling in my notebook. I just wasn't paying attention because I was bored out of my fucking head and I had problems with authority but she just, you know, liked to be the, the lady to call on you if you ain't paying attention, you know, like she went to get mad. But I mean meanwhile this fucking pitch could even speak. Right. She said both. Would you like to come up here and do both? I will never forget it. IT's like in my mind it's like a movie playing out because the anger in my head that this fucking dummy was trying to make me look dumb in front of everybody just because I was scribbling and I wasn't paying attention to your.

Speaker 2:          01:27:07       My. My opinion on math was always like, okay, math is very essential, but don't you have calculators now we do and isn't that like an endless supply of batteries? There is done. Like I'm done [inaudible]. There's only a finite amount of things to pay attention to in the day and I don't give a fuck about these wacky equations that you're making me solve and figure out. I know how to add. I know how to divide. I know how to multiply. Like is it or are we done here? Right. Do I have to keep going? Is this really good that you're, you're making me be a fucking square peg and fit into your fucking round hole. You know? It's like I'm not. I don't want to do what you want me to do. Like this is nonsense. It's weird nowadays. I can't even imaGine going to school with google

Speaker 6:          01:27:45       because then I'd be like, no, I don't want to learn it. I can just search it if I need it. I don't get what. That was a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:27:51       I used to watch a lot of documentaries even when I was a kid and I got in trouble again. Like people will say like, you're a comedian. Were you a class clown? Like I was not really class clown. What I used to do though is draw a lot of cartoons about our teachers are gettIng involved in shit. And we had this one teacher that was really annoying Mr. Holman and h o l m a n very serious, but he was wrong about a lot of shit. And I was, you know, I was fucking 15 years old and uh, I was uh, in class and I was again bored out of my fucking mind. He had a science class, but at least science custOmers a little more interesting. They started going on about lake erie, lake erie, jerry's a dead lake and this and that. It started talking about all the pollution that's involved in lake erie, and I said, well actually I just saw a documentary that was on pbs.

Speaker 2:          01:28:33       It was talking about the resurgence of lake eerie, about how leakier they've worked very hard to filter out the water and they've done all these different things to cut down the pollutants and they've seen a resurgence in the fish population. And he got all fucking mad at me and I was like, have you seen this documentary? There's no, this is not true. And I'm like, it's not true. It's on pbs. I watched it last night. I'm like, oh man, all right. so you're just like them. So the next time we're in class, um, he had like these things that would pull down like projection screens and I

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       pulled the projection screens up and I drew cartoons of him and then I, I pulled the projection screens down. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:29:10       I covered him. So he went to draw on the chalkboard and as you pulled the chalkboard up, there's all these fucking cartoons of him saying wacky shit. And he had this thing that he would do. He would do this, this crazy thing with his hands. We would move his hands like this and then I have this other teacher Mr. White, and he was only like five foot two. So I drew him all the time, but every time I drew I drew him standing on something,

Speaker 6:          01:29:30       standing on a box or still in the other chair or sitting on a stool and I drew it just like him. It's so funny, dude.

Speaker 2:          01:29:37       and I had a one in anthropology teacher who was obsessed with jane goodall and the monkeys, you know, jane goodall lived live with chimpanzees. So I drew this one kid who was a football player who was a nice kid, but he was always kissing her ass because he wanted her to like him. So you get better grades. So I drew him, banging her and like if I can look like her, it looked like him and I drew him back at her say, you know, she was like, oh, give it to me monkeys.

Speaker 6:          01:29:59       I passed it around the class, you know, like I got suspended on two separate occasions for drawing cartoons. I got sent home for trying. That's the only thing I would normally get in trouble for him. I did the same things, but with overhead projectors I would like penis as there was an indian guy in our class. I'd always make fun of his parts because he had really bad farts and then one time they pulled the whole class out and they're like, all right, omar has really bad gas because of his diet and it's not funny and if you guys make fun of it anymore, you guys are all going to be in trouble and I remember this speech, so of course then I only drew only for the rest of the year. I draw this indian guy heart and on people and stuff like that. How ridiculous is that you, you tell them kids not to make fun of farts because it's not fun. How disingenuous is that? You cannot tell someone that farts are funny. As soon as you say farts are funny, I'm not listening to you because you're not being honest with you. You can say farts don't smell. Can you imagine if he loves fire? It's the people that do this, like fart porn. Have you ever seen fart? Fart porn? We're dudes. get their head right and girls' faces and girls fart in their mouth. God, I've got such a hard on now.

Speaker 6:          01:31:13       We've talked about this before about how your farts smell awesome, but other people's foreign military, your farts smell the bat. Except once in awhile, one lets out and you're like ashamed. I had one the other daY was never not wanted by myself, by myself until it was like, oh, smell my own farts and enjoyment. Everybody does that. I think even girls do that. They just don't want to admit it. Girls cut, but what is that? I mean, why? Why is there an evolution? I mean, it's got to be something if everyone does it, like what is it? I think it's like your body sending out like a spray from mating, but probably from acclimation. Literally ridiculous theory. Knock up and get pregnant is stick your dick fucking awesome. I want to make myself what?

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       No, but why do you think that people like their own forks? Why is that a, that sketch? It's like it's it's food that you ate already, so this guy says it's called peaker. The urge to eat, smell, eat random things. I thought, I think people, yeah, it's people that have mineral deficiencies to the point where they're the paint dirt and the other day how weird that would be. Eating dirt, just like craving it like, I need this tO her. can you imagine? Well, you're kidding.

Speaker 2:          01:32:28       Could easily be wired wrong. You think about all the different connections inside people's brains. Now think of people like my friend john jacques machado, my original jujitsu instructor, he was born without his one hand, his left hand. He doesn't have all of his fingers. His left hand only has like a thumb and like nubs, you knoW, and that's how he was born. Deficient some. I mean, I don't know what it was exactly. Some sort of a disease, but he's born without fingers. If you're born without fingers, you could be born with crazy connections in your head that make you love other people's farts. You know, you could be, you know what I'm saying? I mean it's possible. I mean we look at like autism and what they don't understand about autism, but some people who have autism can do crazy things. Like there's a child that can see a place like lists look out the window at a, at a, like a city, and then draw the city and exact detail like down to the fucking street signs and down to the alleyways.

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       I mean, incredible. There's, there's videos of a online doing it. I mean he can just look at an image of a place or go to a place and see something and just completely recreated in his mind and it's, he has a version of autism, you know, it's like the whole rain man thing. It's like, what is that? Like, what, how, you know, what the fuCk is going on that you can see something and record it like exactly what you and I have no chance. I mean if I had a drama backyard, it will be all off and I've been in my backyard and fucking thousand times. But if I had to draw it would be all fucking wanky. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:33:59       what the fuck is that? I know. It's really weird. I know a friend that. Is that a friend's uncle is that I met him once, I met him once and he's always like talking about like how he used to sit on his mom's shoulders during parades and stuff like that. He met me once though and then every year he can't stop exactly. Talking about me to her. Like she's like, where's brian? And brian said he was going to the store one one and like, like remember everything about me, he buys me gifts, you know, we broke up a long time ago. She's like duty by guests and, and he knows everything about you not stop talking about you, but then

Speaker 2:          01:34:34       wow, so we're doing to fuck you did one in me. That's strange man. I mean it's like the potential of the human mind, you know? Do you think it's because they, there's obviously something, some sort of a disconnect socially that with people that have autism, do you think it's sort of like one of those things where people who can't see can hear incredibly. You know, it's like when you were, you were missing one sense. Your other senses like supercharged?

Speaker 4:          01:34:59       Yeah, I just, I, I don't know because sometimes I think things like that or I think what if he knows exactly everything that's going on but his mouth doesn't work. Kind of like when you're so fucked up and you're trying to say something. If it was like, you can't have your, you know, what you're thinking out in maybe. And I'm like, that's it. That's it. There an affectionate. That's the thing with them though. There's a social disconnect and a real disconnect

Speaker 2:          01:35:23       where they don't, they don't express themselves, they don't smile as much, don't make eye contact as much as other kids do, you know? but in so doing that and in doing that they have this incredible focus. Like I have a friend whose child, his son has a mild form of asperger's, was like an autism type of thing and his son is a jujitsu wizard. The kids or an assassin. I mean he's really, really fucking good. Like, like goes at a head to head with like world champions. He's like really, really good. And one of the reasons why it's really good is he has this intense ability to focus on things and you know, he's not so good socially, doesn't have a girlfriend, not so good at like having buddies. But goddamn you get on the mat with that motherfucker, he remembers every move and he's countering your moves and advancing and moving forward.

Speaker 2:          01:36:07       And he taps like really high level black belts all the time. You know, it's like autistic doesn't necessarily mean super, super intelligent, doesn't necessarily mean you know, some sort of a rain man type genius. But it has the potential it. Which makes me think, I wonder if it's, you know, almost like there's so many people that are autistic dude. It's like one out of 100 now, you know, and it's advancing over the years. I wonder if it's possible that, you know, I mean people say that it's due to environmental conditions. It could be due to pollution, it could be due to diet, it could be due to the hormones in our food. There's a bunch of different theories on what causes autism. But if it's happening in much greater numbers than it ever has before, and that's debatable as well because some people say it's not.

Speaker 2:          01:36:53       There's just more people are diagnosed as being autistic now because they've changed the diagnosis. But that's, that's under debate as well. But what if it's sort of a next stage of evolution would have emotions and dealing with, you know, the way a human beings. I've always beeN like really emotional and what if that's not going to be necessary in the future. what if that's slowly being phased out because human beings don't have to use our fight or flight reflexes and instincts anymore because you know, we're not running from saber tooth tigers and shed. Basically. We're just dealing with civilized society and that society becomes more and more civilized and as society becomes more and more modern, more people are born with this detachment from emotions. And one of the reasons why I thought this is because of amish people and amish people live their life in a very traditional old school, sort of a word. And it, it's kind of a fucked up wacky religion. But you know, they drove around the horse driven buggies and they build their own houses and you know, and I don't know if

Speaker 6:          01:37:55       they even use electricity to some of these women use electricity, some of them driving a regular car, some of them have real jobs and they're amish. It just depends on what kind of learners they are. But, but the whole premise originally was that these people lived like a certain group of people hundreds of years ago. Well, they have a much, much, much lower. I'm a history or much, much lower numbers of autistic children, much lower. It might be just something like cell phones and the signals are cell phones, beepers and, and all this shit that started making it increase orange, just like splenda, you know, it could be something we're not even thinking about it. We don't know. And that's what skip aspartame, aspartame and shit like that could easily be. We don't know the only way to do that. You know, there's a lot of theories about, you know, um, you know, people say that a lot of people, there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about vaccinations and there's a lot of people say there's no scientific connection whatsoever and people always want to jump on that and you know, your tinfoil hat. But this whole thing about

Speaker 2:          01:38:52       autism, what people don't realize, there's thousands of people have been paid off by the autism court of America because of a, I don't remember the exact title of the court, but I believe it is autism court, uh, not autism core, excuse me, vaccination court, like the vac. Let me, let me find the exact number in the exact, a theory because I'm one of the kennedy's, I think Robert Kennedy jr is a heavily involved in this shit and a lot of people have been paid off by vaccine court because a, and it's in the thousands of families because of their, their children suffering from brain damage after being vaccinated, that they had brain swelling and brain damage and they received sizable a rewards from the courts. Now, if that's really true, how do we not know that you know you, you're not damaging other shit with vaccinations, especially like heavy duty vaccinations with through marisol and all that stuff that's been linked.

Speaker 2:          01:39:46       I mean the stuff that they've removed from, from vaccines, it's a real heavy debated issue because people don't want to thank a few people have had their children vaccinated. They don't want to think that they've done anything wrong to their children and people have children that are autistic. They want to blame someone and so they try to blame the vaccination. But the bottom line is, you know, you're injecting chemicals into your baby when you're not even supposed to give kids fucking peanut butter. You're not even supposed to give babies peanut butter because they might have a peanut allergy, but yet you can shoot them up with all these fucking chemicals. you know? I don't know. You know, this whole jenny mccarthy debate. No, and then she's running around saying that vaccinations cause autism to the kids, but I have friends that say their kids were more and we have a friend that we know that his kid got the measles, mumps and rubella and then instantly was different, like instantly became detached, got fucking weird and, and, and the kid has some serious autism now whether or not it's connected or whether or not he had a preexisting condition that was exacerbated by those vaccinations.

Speaker 2:          01:40:46       That's possible as well. But who the fuck knows what's causing all this shit? It could be, you know, just the of pollution, the higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air. It could be, you know, the preservatives in food. It could be, you know, it could be a bunch of shit, but it also could be the civilization. It could be the fact that as civilization progress is the need to have all these emotions and the need to, to exist the way people have always existed as is morphing. It's changing. You know, we're going to be like fucking aliens. I mean, if you think about like all the depictions of aliens and a science fiction, the advanced aliens, they're always super unemotional. Take me to your leader, you know, it's like that type of shit. It's like we kind of inherently know that emotions are sort of holding back progress and as human beings become super technical or super, super technologically evolved, that eventually we're going to get to a point where we're not irrational and emotional, you know? And you think about like the shit that happened with that crazy girl that got you arrested. LIke what? What was that? It's nutty emotions like chaos and emotions, you know, you think about almost all murder.

Speaker 6:          01:41:50       Why japanese people never have domestic violence issues or have any issues to support this one. I mean, I'm,

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       you know, but, but you think about that like when, when we think about like alien life, super advanced alien life, you know, the guy from the day the earth stood still was always super stoic and unemotional and you know, I mean we kind of inherently know that that is the future. That that's where we're headed. And that's autism. I mean, it's kind of a fucked up thing to think, but I mean maybe all these people like one out of 100 have autism and the debate as to whether or not it's been, you know, just do, they've changed the diagnosis. I don't know if that's the case and I'll take, you know, either it debate as to what is causing it, but the only way you know what's causing it as you take the exact same biological human being, you do a bunch of shit to him.

Speaker 2:          01:42:43       He has autIsm, you go back in time, you try it without the shit you see. If he develops autism, you'd, you start removing things. other than that, I mean it's just speculation when you're dealing with these kinds of numbers. One out of 100. I mean that's, these are pretty significant numbers. You know, you have a thousand people. Do you have 100 autistic kids? You know, that's not a man. That's crazy. Got $100. it a lot of god damn paper. Have you ever seen retard porn? Are there is a retard point? You're seeing it. What if they do retard fart porn that

Speaker 6:          01:43:09       oh, retard fart porn be awesome. No, it's weird because like retard, like you feel like you're watching something illegal, but then you're like, wait, this isn't an adult. But then you're like, wait, he doesn't really know. He's getting fucked with a dildo and his asshole dude, I saw something the other day, so I'm hardcore retard porn where this girl who was also retarded but shoving a dildo up his retarded guys asshole and the girl seemed like more retarded. But the guy, I don't know, it's so weird. And I started wanting to, about how was awful. Don't never watched it. Don't ever watch it. So, you know, that's the thing about which obviously we talked about porn, like who buys porn today? The problem is like fucking nobody's porn.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       So to make money in porn, they got to go deep. Well, you know, porn, it always has these walls that they hit and they always come out of it because the bottom line is, uh, there's always going to be porn. You know? How do you make money though when there's so much of it already on the inner, you know, it's really amazing how, uh, like movies and stuff like that or having a hard time getting their videos off the internet. But if yOu tried to find like a movie, like if you want to find this as certain movie, it was important. A lot of these websites all work together like these, these unicorns and stuff like that. Like they'll give you a 30, 30 minute, 32nd clip or something like that, but they're keeping the majority of their main movies off all these websites, which I find really amazing. What do you mean? Like a. If you're trying to find like a jenna jamison movie to our jenna jamison movie compared to seeing avatar so you can get an a bit torrent easily. Yeah. Not being know how many porn stars are, are not on bit torrent, but really it's not the same as as like pirate bay, you know, porn that harder to find bet you're wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:44:54       I bet if you go to newsgroups and shit, I bet they trade shit at a rapid rate. I think you're just not

Speaker 4:          01:45:00       obsessed. Not there as much though, is what I'm saying. I mean you can go to pirate bay has a lot of porn. They had porn porn but it's not pirate parties. Not about porn though. Morally about like where's and it's about movies, music, videos, files about everything. But it really is about. But it's not the same percentage of porn, like 25 percent of everything on the internet as porn over. I'm just saying that the main thing that porn is getting into the most I guess nowadays is having personal websites. So if you find it, if you have, if you find a girl like so and so down the street, yeah. You become a member for nine bucks a month. She gets hurt or her webcam just sitting there playing with a bottle, you know. So yeah. That's like the big deal, right? His webcam shows for those girls to a facebook page. It's like that girl that's on our, our um,

Speaker 2:          01:45:43       message board. Crazy amber, crazy. Amber literally makes her living by doing like live webcam shows,

Speaker 4:          01:45:50       founders. He's one of the first girls they ever do hd video on the internet for porn. She wrote about it on our website. Remember she had like a press release like 60 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. She's a pretty fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       She's heavily a tech check associated. Yeah. She's, I don't know what everyone's doing. It's crazy. Crazy. Amber.com or ambers amateur. hardcore.com. Just look up crazy and you'll find her if you want to find your finer. She's crazy. Amber on the rogan board. Um, if you don't know what the rogan board is, I got a forum that has like, it's almost like $3 million. It's up to posts on it. So pretty wild for him. Any fucked up news, anything that's going on, anything. It's crazy. Any new video that came out. Anything that, anything. Bananas is on forums dot joe rogan.net. The rogan board. If you get on the board and you sign up and you could be a member, anybody can be a member, but if you're a dickhead, if you going to retard, we pink. You look pink. Hue is. There's two forms. There's one forum that's regular forum, it's called shit talking one on one and there's another forum that's called special ed. And what special ed is, is when you are too fucked up, you need too much attention because too much trouble. You start fucking, you know, just harassing people and being annoying, starting dumb argument,

Speaker 6:          01:47:06       stupid shit stocker. I've noticed, especially with twitter's a lot more creepy stalkers and I thought there was a bunch of out there that are fucking nuts and that you wouldn't ordinarily let them into your life. And now because of the internet, you know, they get into your life and you've got to figure out a way to filter them. You know what I mean? Look, sometimes we have this chat here and uh, I look at the chat and sometimes people just constant

Speaker 2:          01:47:26       you saying dumb, annoying, stupid shit over and over and over and over and over again. But the beautiful thing is you just click on them and ban them. You know, and that's the beautiful thing about twitter too, like some people,

Speaker 6:          01:47:36       well, twitter, you stupid shit and all they're trying to do is get your attention. That's what's scary is like there's a few people that they wake up from the morning to sleep every three minutes writing a message and you're like, tHis is what this person is on the message board. No, like on twitter and I, some of these people really creep me the fuck. Well, it's given them a direct

Speaker 2:          01:47:56       action. Two, it's given some people like something to do, something to look forward to. They get to interact with, you know all these different human beings.

Speaker 6:          01:48:03       Yeah. Like that little girl that you guys always talk about. What are you doing? Talking. She fucking has the one sided conversations. He's been trying to fuck me for the last two months. This fucker. Dude, why are you not said one word to her, but every, every day. See your face. How are we going to pop some fellow she wants. I don't see anything wrong with. It is called, which is for young lady. I don't know. It's funny. It's like I, I followed her sometimes and she's like having full on conversations with jenna jamison right back and forth and I'm like, that's fine. It goes back and forth with this. What do you think of the golden

Speaker 2:          01:48:40       goldman sachs case? Do you know about that? Do you go there? You know what golden sachs is now? Goldman sachs is a gigantic bank that's getting sued now by the federal government is actually looking into them. They're going to bring them to court and they're gonna. They're gonna. Try them and figure out how the fuck they defraud people. They shorted. What they did was they sold people a bunch of, uh, they told people to buy things and then they banked against it. So they told people that we're shorting means is like, say if you decide that, uh, you know, uh, you look at the market and you say, okay, this company is going to take a shit. They're going to fall apart, but you keep selling that company to your clients. You keep telling them, hey, you should invest in this company because this company is a good investment.

Speaker 2:          01:49:19       But meanwhile you're shorting, which means you're betting that that company is going to fail on the side. And they made tons of money. They basically fucked over their customers and manipulated the whole system and made fucking hundreds of billions of dollars for this and there's this guy matt taibbi, who's been writing about this in wall street in a rolling stone magazine, fascinating and infuriating articles all about the corruption. It's involved in wall street and it's fucking mind blowing that they can still pull that shit in 2010. You know, this is one thing that I sit on stage to stage this weekend. I've been talking about this a lot. Like you know when people talk about, well you don't understand the economy is complicated and here's what I don't understand. There's the same amount of fucking people. Okay. There's the same amount of shit, the same amount of metal st, amount of materials, the same amount of people buying things.

Speaker 2:          01:50:04       Where the fuck did all the money go? What happened? Well good though the stoCk market crashed and the housIng market was inflated and fell upon. What the fuck are you eating? Saying what does that mean? To me that means that the system is bullshit. It means the whole system is fucking nuts. I think everyone knows that system is bullshit there. I don't know why he says it's not that I'm surprised, but I'm surprised of is that it keeps going. We've talked about this before, that our system is like our culture, our system of government is like windows 98 and then the windows 95 was like 100 viruses and we're just throwing patches at it, trying to fix things, trying to work around stuff, but that's really what it's like. It's like this ancient fucking stupid system that doesn't work and it crashes all the time and it's got all these bugs and it's filled with corruption, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:50:52       And yet still there's, there's no solutions for it. Move to an island. What can you do it? You can't even move son. What are you going to do over there for work? Going to fucking pick coconuts. How about you? Going back to manual. You have people to talk about how they hate society the way it is right now. You would be so fucking happy if you move to an island. You had to work for a living to come back here. You'd be so happy to go back to wildlife was just pay 28 percent tax and you know. No,

Speaker 4:          01:51:22       I remember when I was in high school and how he's on vacation in myrtle beach, which is the widest trashes the case in ever, but I remember talking to this guy and all he did every day was open up this little shack that looked like a grass cut and make margarita is for people and he just sat there every day that we were talking. I was talking to them like, you did this every day. He goes, fuck you. Like I see the hottest chick that sit here on the beach and do nothing but make drinks. Man. It's the greatest life ever. I'm like, I love this guy. I was like, that he makes just enough because you'd probably. I mean probably could never make enough to buy like something huge or anything, but it gets bought by a private relies on credit and stuff like that as a life.

Speaker 4:          01:51:58       To me, I was like, oh, you just pretty much do what you like to do. I don't know. Yeah, there's an argument for that man. There's definitely an argument for the dude that checks out. I'm just like an expatriate moves to Costa Rica, sits on the fucking beach and drinks margarita is why the world explodes in the distance. Yeah, I mean there's an argument for that. My dad's about to retire. He's 60 something just about to retire this year and I'm like, I'm like, aren't you scared that you know you're not going to have any income coming in at all and you guys, it's kind of scary but you're not saved up so much. And I'm like, yeah, but you could have one hospital thing, fuck your life up and then now you have to go back to work like 20 years later and you're gonna be out of the loop working at fucking grocery stores, trying to pay for your wife to buy new diapers for it, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:52:39       And that freaks me the fuck out. How much does your dad I've saved up, I mean, how many years worth money? I'm not really sure, but it's probably over a million. I would imagine. It's got over a million dollars car. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's what you see. I don't under. I will ensure. Yeah, yeah. I noticed but I don't take smart. Yeah. But still, but nowadays a million dollars. I mean you go to the doctor and you get fucking chemo, you're paying like $200,000, you know, or something like that. Definitely make sure you keep up on your health insurance. Scary them hit or scared he could because he could live another 50 years old. Sixty two or something like that. Because your dad going to lift up two years. Well, I mean, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          01:53:24       no, but he could live 40 years. What does he want to do? Like when he retired as you have a thing that he wants, he likes, he's just like me but with the, they didn't have computers so he does everything else but like electronics and building things. So he will make like a hot tub and his living room, you know, that build his own. Yeah. He'll feel like the whole living room and hot tub just refine, you know? Wow. That's cool. Things like that that keep. TheY keep people happy man. Hobbies and things do. Maybe he can invent something and sell it. Maybe he should concentrate on trying to do that while he's been trying to break. Was a perpetual motion for the longest time. So he has all these perpetual motion machines in his basement and you'd go in there and just magnets with bike bikes, sickle tires and like.

Speaker 4:          01:54:06       And he's got like 15 patents. he builds things all the time. Let's say that it's like he builds a computer that gets right on out of your bathroom, you know, and then you're like, what? What's radon gas? Well, why doesn't he just a co. I mean that seems like a, like a really promising avenue to pursue it. Is that creative? Maybe he should just think about that. Think about retiring and using all this time to try to come up with some new way to make income. Right. That's what I told him. He needs to like make something. Why not? fuck it, man. Little dude, you know better to take that chance at 60 then 60 days that we're sending was better to take that chance at 60. Then they'll take their chance. When you're fucking, you're almost dead. And they're like, god, I should have done something interesting.

Speaker 4:          01:54:44       You know, what if he, what if he makes it and one falls suddenly starts making a good living off of something he created and get up at noon and fucking go to the coffee shop and, you know, check this out, check this out. How crazy. Sometimes things happen in life, you know, uh, they were supposed to come out and visit me next month and he was going to retire the following month. And my stepmom was thinking about retiring the following month. And then, uh, I broke up with my relationships. So they decided not to come the following day after deciding not to come, they're getting late. My step mom's getting laid off. But because she had like over a week of vacation time set aside that she'd never used. They have to like force some kind of like year pension plan or whatever the bottom line is just because she didn't, they didn't take that vacation. She gets paid for a year for no reason. An extra year. So she would have visited me and bought that ticket. She would have been screwed by the corporate world because I love when the house. Do you believe in fate and stuff like that and like things that happened for a reason. Do you believe that you think everything's kind of set out and you really can't change it? It's easy to be cynical.

Speaker 2:          01:55:50       I love that idea. But it also seems sometimes like, it almost seems like life is scripted, you know, and in your situation, I think it seems like at some time in my situation in my life, it's sometimes it seems so ridiculous that it almost seems like we are living our own movie, you know, the, the, you know that. And the more gonzo the fucking news gets and the more bizarro, you know, uh, our, our culture gets, the more, it seems like a movie, the more it seems like, it almost seems fake. It almost seems like we're living in a dream, you know? And if you look at some of the things that happen to certain people, you, you, you go, well, what's it attributable? Trivial is it, is it, can you attribute it to the fact that they've lived positive life and so good things are happening to them and is it karma?

Speaker 2:          01:56:36       So it's karma real because that's like one of the trippiest spiciest of notions ever. So is that what's really going on? Or is it because there's a grand plot to life? Is it because life is like a gigantic mathematical equation and there's like a set, there's a set result it's going to happen no matter what. That's all working towards that set result and you getting a certain job and you meeting a certain person is all part of the grand plan of the universe. That's fucking weird. It is weird. It's, it's, it's you can't say one or the other. You can't say yes. I believe in fate and fate is real mean. You should consider it, but you also can't say fate's not real. And you know you decide your own destiny because I don't know if that's true either. You know, I mean we are a weird combination of biology, of life, experiences of genetics. You know, there's, there's a lot of shit going on, you know, how you interpret the life experience, the people you come in contact with that help you rethink the way you look at things. I mean, how many people have you ever met that inspire you and literally change the way you think about those?

Speaker 4:          01:57:37       It makes me wonder if I was supposed to meet and go through this experience and a lot of times I just want to like, I felt like that last sound is going on in the back of it, you know, because it just seems like it's just like that. Like it's just

Speaker 2:          01:57:50       a weird, like quick, like some shit just seems fake. I think a lot of it is because you live in your life the right way or you think you'll a lot of is you live in real life positive. You're not being shitty to anybody.

Speaker 4:          01:58:00       Well, karma is a real thing. Definitely. I believe karma is or that's why this fuck that's ratting out larry king's wife. He's going to get it. Shit's gonna hit the fan for you son. You know he's gonna have nipple camp certainty.

Speaker 2:          01:58:10       It's going to get ugly. I don't know. I don't know if it's true and I think, you know, it's one of those subjects where people are very polarized on it, you know, some people, uh, will people will argue vehemently that their size correct because it's sort of like, like a windows versus mac argument, you know, it's like a religion versus atheism argument. It's like, you know, people want to be correct. They have choose a stance, they choose a camp that they're in, you know, and that's fate is one of the weird ones. I'm open to the idea. There's a fate. I'm open to the idea that there's, that life really is like some sort of a gigantic equation and that it's moving towards something I don't know. I trY to, I try to keep an open mind about all of that stuff because I think as soon as you decide that you have the information, one way or another, you're being silly.

Speaker 4:          01:58:57       Yeah. Because Then you're going to block off with and only hear what you want to hear and then you're, you're living the right,

Speaker 2:          01:59:03       right. I mean, we have friends that believe in nutty things and we've had conversations with these friends that believe in nutty things and you can tell they are not even considering the fact that these nutty things they believe in are in fact just nutty things, you know? I mean, that's, that's a disconnect. There's, you know, and you said it best when you said you're not keeping everything on the table. That's rule number one. Rule number one, you have to keep up

Speaker 4:          01:59:27       even when you have 100 percent everything on the table, like a positive on the table. Why even bother taking the table away? You know, if something comes up, it'd be no reason that. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:59:36       Exactly. We get married to a, an answer a yes or a no. A side of. For or against, you know, I mean it's like religion. It's like anything else. Human beings are very insecure and you know, our life inherently is insecure and because of that I think we try to, we try to put things in a box so that we can deal with them when they're in a box. There it is. We've got labeled. It's wrapped up. Okay. Okay. God is not real. It's in that box. Let's move on. Okay. do we like windows and mac? I say windows. Mac os for faggots. Put it in the box. We're move on. Whereas for pc, getting to this is just for idiots. Idiots that, you know. I don't know. I think, uh, I don't know. I think we hit two hours. I think this is good. We're going to end on a positive note list. Gentleman.
