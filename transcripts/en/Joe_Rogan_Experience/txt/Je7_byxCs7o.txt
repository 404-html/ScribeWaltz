Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Look how big this Paris like, wait, wait to see this video. You're going to shit your pants. So it goes. Go fullscreen, Jamie. It's not going full screen. Here you go. You're going to shit your pants to Swedish man. So this guy, he sees it in the woods and he starts running up to him. Whereas the volume buddy, it's all wintery wise. No sound. It was definitely sound. We got to hear the sound because the guy screams at it. Hold on. We got to figure out how it worked. Holy Shit. I never saw. I never even thought that would work.

Speaker 1:          00:34          What's up? What's definitely got sound? So let's figure it out because you got to hear it because the guy goes, well look, I'll put his arms out to the side. Look at the size of it. It's running at him, like running at him and he was able to scare it. He, he reels back like he's scared. Well he went for it, you know, look, look bad. I was like, Oh shit, look it up. Look how big he is and look how much bigger that thing. It's like four times, five times bigger than him. Oh my God. Oh my God. That makes me freak out. If he had turned and Ronnie would have been eating. Oh yeah, for sure. I mean, the thing ran at him like it was dinner time. I was that close to a bear. Where in Alaska and Denali. Jesus. A grizzly.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Yup. What the big ass grizzly. We woke up in the morning and uh, we were in back country for a couple of weeks just hiking and walking around and um, we got, we woke up and we were making her breakfast and we look up on a ridge and there's this big ass bear. This is September, so it's like late, you know, it's like they were getting ready to hibernate and he's walking down the ridge and as we're packing up and uh, you know, up the Ridge is actually where we were cleaning our dishes and doing all this stuff. And now we're back at camp. We're breaking down to hike out and we see this thing go walking down. Just dumb asses. We're so lucky we didn't get eaten. The Guy, the, uh, we pack up and we just start walking in the same direction that the bear was going.

Speaker 1:          02:09          We were like, he's not going to be going. He, he probably, he's beaten us there. So we're walking through these, these reads, these bamboo kind of little reads, but there were only like six feet high and there's like eight of us, maybe six of us and we're walking with our packs on and you just hear and you see the reeds separating slowly though, like it's not coming fast. Just like, what the hell? That's probably the bear. We see that it's the bear and you know, you're supposed to do with that guy did put your arms up or at least freeze and don't see everyone in the group took off. That's the one thing I ran all my frozen in the pose. Me and my one friend, like you're not supposed to do the we run at, we're in and they take off with their backpacks, but the bear, thankfully just by a stroke of luck, this thing was so fat and tired and the end of September he just wanted to go down low, gets some more berries and take a snooze. Was not interested in us at all. He was just so lucky. So lucky. But I swear to God it was for me to the end of this table. Yeah. Well when they're, when they're gathering berries, that's when your safest. They get in their head that that's what they want to eat and they eat a lot of bearings. He did not. He was not interested to fuck all that. So close animals.

Speaker 1:          03:41          I mean I love the the there. I think it's cool, but God dammit, they scare the shit out of me. It was a video of these guys. They're hanging out by this river and they have like a little lawn chair and this bear is enormous. Crazy bear just walks up and sits down next to them. Have you seen that one Jamie? Close encounter with grit. Grizzly bear casually walks up to people and they just had to talk to them. They're like, hey man, get the fuck out of here. And the bar just gets up and leaves. But I mean, he's like a school bus. It's like a minivan. I always describe it like a minivan. Did you find one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is it. This is it. Look at this. Look at this. Wow. Look at the size of this. Just sat next to his chair.

Speaker 1:          04:21          He just pulls up to his chair. A beautiful animal. They'll look at that thing. Oh my. There's the gorgeous dead do. If that's you, you can't do shit. Can't do shit because you don't want to provoke it. No, no. You definitely don't want to back up. That thing is just chasing salmon right now. Yeah. You don't want to yell at it. Yeah. As long as you don't hit it doesn't think you're a threat. They're really dumb, right? In their mind. Yeah. I'm not dumb. Like. No. I mean like, like dumb. Like if they were a person they'd be retarded. Right?

Speaker 1:          04:56          They're bold, they're simple. They're predators. You know, they get in their head like what they want to do. Oh my God, he's just sitting down. This is awesome. Just decided, chill. What a clear shot look at is, look at his claws. One Swipe. I mean your faces off. The guys filming this is 10 feet away from him. He's right there and the eventually talks to him. He was like, Hey, get out of here. Like the bear looks at him like we really got close. It is the bear. Looks like a little annoyed for a second. Do the thing. Just wandered towards him. Seriously. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          05:37          They're everywhere. Oh my God. Oh my God. Now I don't even feel bad for that guy. Back that up. Like why should they go to the river? This case, sitting with a lawn chair by the river while one, two. Let's see. Three, four, five, six. And that one said, oh my God. Oh God, there's a dozen baird's a dozen. Massive grizzly bears. Oh my God. I'm so scared. I got this more. Look at those other two. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Oh my God. How funny if you pull back and the guy with the camera is a bear. Oh, Jesus Christ. That's amazing. Oh my God. They're the coolest animal. My favorite animal. Do you God damn cool until they're eating you? Yeah, and that's so cool. Now.
